Abstract = {{Establishing housing supply strategies in a stagnant housing market is a
   significant issue because of two contradictory and concurrent problems.
   The first is the long-cherished desire to supply low-cost housing for
   low-and middle-income families, and the second is the problem of high
   vacancy levels attributable to low-level sales rates. Governments have
   been continuously implementing various supply policies intended to
   distribute houses evenly and to keep supply and demand in balance.
   However, it is difficult to satisfy consumers, owners, and suppliers
   because of conflicting needs and requirements. This paper therefore
   applies a system dynamics methodology and offers an integrated model
   that encompasses the for-profit behavior of each market participant,
   analyzes supply policies, and suggests appropriate and effective
   policies. Utilizing the case of the Korean housing market, the proposed
   model simulates future trends in house prices, balances between supply
   and demand, construction companies' earnings, and vacancy rates when
   various housing supply scenarios are applied. With extensive studies
   with the results from the simulation model, the authors recommend using
   private construction companies to stabilize housing distribution rates
   and the private supply system and ensure a balance between supply and
   demand. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000577. (C) 2013 American

Title = {{Classifier-based latency estimation: a novel way to estimate and predict
   BCI accuracy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that detect event-related
   potentials (ERPs) rely on classification schemes that are vulnerable to
   latency jitter, a phenomenon known to occur with ERPs such as the P300
   response. The objective of this work was to investigate the role that
   latency jitter plays in BCI classification. Approach. We developed a
   novel method, classifier-based latency estimation (CBLE), based on a
   generalization of Woody filtering. The technique works by presenting the
   time-shifted data to the classifier, and using the time shift that
   corresponds to the maximal classifier score. Main results. The variance
   of CBLE estimates correlates significantly (p < 10(-42)) with BCI
   accuracy in the Farwell-Donchin BCI paradigm. Additionally, CBLE
   predicts same-day accuracy, even from small datasets or datasets that
   have already been used for classifier training, better than the accuracy
   on the small dataset (p < 0.05). The technique should be relatively
   classifier-independent, and the results were confirmed on two linear
   classifiers. Significance. The results suggest that latency jitter may
   be an important cause of poor BCI performance, and methods that correct
   for latency jitter may improve that performance. CBLE can also be used
   to decrease the amount of data needed for accuracy estimation, allowing
   research on effects with shorter timescales.}},

Volume = {{433}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{188-198}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A deformation-mechanism map has been developed for unirradiated
   zircaloy-4 based on the creep data available from the literature of the
   last 35 years. These data have been analyzed to identify different creep
   mechanisms, based on the forms of the relationships between stress,
   temperature and strain rate. This identification allowed the activation
   energies and other associated creep parameters to be derived for each
   mechanism. The creep parameters were used to construct a
   deformation-mechanism map for zircaloy-4 that shows the conditions under
   which different mechanisms are dominant. This information provides an
   important tool for assessing the effects of stress and temperature in
   design, especially when extrapolating to different regimes. As an
   example of how this information might be used in a numerical analysis
   for design purposes, a novel mechanism-based creep framework was
   implemented within a finite-element code. Although the framework was
   developed specifically for zircaloy-4, it provides a general example of
   how mechanism-based creep laws can be implemented into finite-element
   analyses. This approach allows the creep of complex geometries to be
   analyzed rigorously, with the dominant deformation mechanisms being
   identified and evolving automatically in response to the local
   temperatures and stresses. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The investigation of the conversion of vibrational energy into
   electrical power has become a major field of research. In recent years,
   bistable energy harvesting devices have attracted significant attention
   due to some of their unique features. Through a snap-through action,
   bistable systems transition from one stable state to the other, which
   could cause large amplitude motion and dramatically increase power
   generation. Due to their nonlinear characteristics, such devices may be
   effective across a broad-frequency bandwidth. Consequently, a rapid
   engagement of research has been undertaken to understand bistable
   electromechanical dynamics and to utilize the insight for the
   development of improved designs. This paper reviews, consolidates, and
   reports on the major efforts and findings documented in the literature.
   A common analytical framework for bistable electromechanical dynamics is
   presented, the principal results are provided, the wide variety of
   bistable energy harvesters are described, and some remaining challenges

Abstract = {{Asphaltenes are a solubility class of petroleum crude oil that can
   destabilize and deposit in both upstream and downstream processes. In
   this study, asphaltene deposits were generated in metal capillaries by
   heptane addition to crude oils, and it was found that deposition is
   caused by submicrometer asphaltene aggregates. Deposits were generated
   at heptane concentrations above and significantly below the
   instantaneous onset point. Analysis of the results reveals that the
   governing factor controlling the magnitude of asphaltene deposition is
   the concentration of insoluble asphaltenes present in a crude
   oil-precipitant mixture and the instantaneous onset point is irrelevant
   to the deposition process. Electron microscopy images of the deposits
   represent the first images and confirmation of arterial growth in
   laboratory generated asphaltene deposits. The axial deposit profile was
   found to be highly nonuniform. In addition, deposits formed shortly
   after when oil and heptane mix, revealing that the destabilization of
   asphaltenes occurs virtually immediately after a precipitant is added.
   The results were reproduced with a second crude oil, indicating that
   asphaltene deposition behavior is broadly applicable.}},

Abstract = {{Coroning is a complex and multi-directional gear finishing process
   involving metal removal of gear teeth surface, and condition monitoring
   has not been applied to this process. In order to capture the progress
   of wear, an acoustic emission (AE) sensor is used, but the large data
   size of AE requires extensive dimension reduction and feature selection.
   The conventional method of averaging to reduce the data size may have
   the risk of losing information as higher frequencies are filtered off. A
   two-step feature selection method is implemented using class mean
   scatter criterion and modified relevance/redundancy analysis. This
   method results in feature dimension reduction and enhances
   classification performance. It involves first ranking candidate features
   by calculating their separability. Features which are correlated are
   then combined to reduce dimensions without averaging. Application of
   this two-step feature selection technique enables coroning tool wear to
   be monitored with a classification rate of 98.3 \% compared to 94.1 \%
   using conventional feature selection.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The entry and exit of flexible bodies through an air-water interface is
   studied using a tightly coupled fluid-structure interaction solver. The
   fluid domain is modeled using finite-volume CFD and the flexible
   structure is represented by a modal basis. The current work uses finite
   elements to generate the structural mode shapes and frequencies. The
   modal description allows for a reduction in structural degrees of
   freedom to reduce computation time. A linearized boundary condition is
   used on the mutual interface to eliminate mesh deformation. The accuracy
   of the method is quantified using the constant-velocity-wedge-impact
   problem. The quality of the fluid solution for the entry and exit
   problem is evaluated using a rigid wedge case and comparison to Von
   Karman and Wagner theories. Finally, the response of an elastic wedge
   during entry and exit is studied with the fluid-structure interaction
   solver. The results are used to assess two common approximations, namely
   the rigid-quasi-static and rigid-dynamic approximations. It is shown
   that for entry and exit, hydroelastic effects may be important for a
   wide range of loading conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nuclear power currently provides about 13\% of electrical power
   worldwide, and has emerged as a reliable baseload source of electricity.
   A number of materials challenges must be successfully resolved for
   nuclear energy to continue to make further improvements in reliability,
   safety and economics. The operating environment for materials in current
   and proposed future nuclear energy systems is summarized, along with a
   description of materials used for the main operating components.
   Materials challenges associated with power uprates and extensions of the
   operating lifetimes of reactors are described. The three major materials
   challenges for the current and next generation of water-cooled fission
   reactors are centered on two structural materials aging degradation
   issues (corrosion and stress corrosion cracking of structural materials
   and neutron-induced embrittlement of reactor pressure vessels), along
   with improved fuel system reliability and accident tolerance issues. The
   major corrosion and stress corrosion cracking degradation mechanisms for
   light-water reactors are reviewed. The materials degradation issues for
   the Zr alloy-clad UO2 fuel system currently utilized in the majority of
   commercial nuclear power plants are discussed for normal and off-normal
   operating conditions. Looking to proposed future (Generation IV) fission
   and fusion energy systems, there are five key bulk radiation degradation
   effects (low temperature radiation hardening and embrittlement;
   radiation-induced and -modified solute segregation and phase stability;
   irradiation creep; void swelling; and high-temperature helium
   embrittlement) and a multitude of corrosion and stress corrosion
   cracking effects (including irradiation-assisted phenomena) that can
   have a major impact on the performance of structural materials. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Conventional culture systems are often limited in their ability to
   regulate the growth and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.
   Microfluidic systems can overcome some of these limitations by providing
   defined growth conditions with user-controlled spatiotemporal cues.
   Microfluidic systems allow researchers to modulate pluripotent stem cell
   renewal and differentiation through biochemical and mechanical
   stimulation, as well as through microscale patterning and organization
   of cells and extracellular materials. Essentially, microfluidic tools
   are reducing the gap between in vitro cell culture environments and the
   complex and dynamic features of the in vivo stem cell niche. These
   microfluidic culture systems can also be integrated with microanalytical
   tools to assess the health and molecular status of pluripotent stem
   cells. The ability to control biochemical and mechanical input to cells,
   as well as rapidly and efficiently analyze the biological output from
   cells, will further our understanding of stem cells and help translate
   them into clinical use. This review provides a comprehensive insignt
   into the implications of microfluidics on pluripotent stem cell
   research.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{1, 2}},
Pages = {{204-212}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The complex system response of 3D position-sensitive gamma-ray detectors
   complicates modeling the recorded measurements and makes exact
   expressions for detection performance intractable. This makes source
   detection performance difficult and expensive to compute. Asymptotic
   analysis has the potential to simplify detection performance prediction
   with complex systems and has previously been applied to detection
   performance prediction with simulated gamma-ray detectors. In this work,
   we use asymptotic performance prediction methods to predict points on
   the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the illustrative
   task of detecting a Cs-137 source in background with an 18-detector
   CdZnTe array. We assume that the source position, source energy,
   background spectrum, and background spatial distribution are known.
   Although these assumptions are not always valid in practice, the
   efficiency of the prediction method makes it attractive for detection
   system design problems. Our results show that the asymptotic performance
   prediction method accurately predicts the empirically observed
   performance with real data recorded with a real system. Our results also
   characterize the performance of the detector array for the task of
   source detection. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the
   asymptotic detection performance prediction method make it a viable
   alternative to empirical performance evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Vascularization underlies the success of guided bone
   regeneration (GBR) procedures. This study evaluates the regenerative
   potential of GBR in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF) delivery via an injectable hydrogel system.
   Methods: Critical-sized defects were created in rat calvariae, and GBR
   procedures were performed with a collagen membrane alone (control), or
   plus bolus delivery of VEGF, or plus application of VEGF-releasing
   hydrogels (VEGF-Alg). Four and 8 weeks after treatment, defect sites
   were evaluated with microcomputed tomographic and histomorphometric
   analyses for blood vessel and bone formation.
   Results: At 4 weeks, relative to the control condition, the bolus
   addition of VEGF did not affect blood vessel density within the defect
   site, yet the application of VEGF-Alg significantly (P<0.05) increased
   blood vessel density. Although there was no difference in bone
   regeneration at 4 weeks, at 8 weeks there was a significant (P<0.05)
   increase in bone regeneration in the VEGF-Alg-treated defects.
   Conclusions: These data demonstrate that the application of VEGF-Alg
   enhanced early angiogenesis, whereas at a later time point, it enhanced
   bone regeneration. Controlled delivery approaches of angiogenic growth
   factors used adjunctively with GBR may be a promising strategy for
   enhancing outcomes of GBR. J Periodontol 2013;84:230-238.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the improved performance and stability of bulk
   heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells using five stacks of C-60/LiF
   as cathode buffer layer, which was prepared by alternating deposition of
   C-60 and LiF layers. The five-stacked C-60/LiF film, even with a large
   thickness ratio of LiF to C-60, exhibits good electrical conductivity.
   The devices with five stacks of C-60/LiF buffer layer show a peak power
   conversion efficiency (PCE) which is 19\% higher than that of the
   conventional devices with only LiF interlayer, primarily due to the
   improvement in fill factor (FF) of the device. Moreover, the high
   efficiency of five-stacked C-60/LiF based devices is insensitive to
   changes in the thickness ratio between C-60 and LiF layers. Since much
   thicker LiF can be used in five-stacked C-60/LiF film, these devices
   also show superior air stability as compared to the devices with only
   LiF interlayer. Therefore, five-stacked C-60/LiF is a promising
   alternative to pristine LiF as a cathode buffer layer in polymer solar
   cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, graphene oxide (GO) reduced by thermal annealing was
   employed as a hole transport layer (HTL) in bulk heterojunction (BHJ)
   solar cells. Considering the insulating property of nonreduced GO, the
   annealing temperature plays an important role in recovering the
   conjugated structure of the graphene sheet, and thereby the conductivity
   of GO. BHJ solar cells with high-temperature (e. g., 230 degrees C)
   reduced GO as the HTL showed much larger fill factor (FF) than devices
   with low-temperature (e. g., 130 degrees C) reduced GO as the HTL,
   indicating the better conductivity of GO annealed at an elevated
   temperature due to the removal of oxygen functional groups from the
   graphene sheet to a much-higher level. On the other hand, the work
   function of GO may be lowered toward that of graphene (4.5 eV) with
   increasing the reduction temperature, which results in a decreased
   open-circuit voltage (V-oc) for the high-temperature reduced GO devices.
   By further optimizing the concentration and spin-coating speed of GO
   dispersion, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) that is 26\%
   higher than devices without any HTL. This is mainly attributed to the
   increase in FF as a result of the decreased series resistance (R-s). In
   addition, the PCE of the optimized GO device was similar to 85\% of the
   PCE of the conventional device with
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) HTL.
   We anticipate that further optimization of the reduction conditions (e.
   g., using chemical reductants) will lead to the better performance of GO
   solar cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Atom probe tomography (APT) is used to investigate the composition of
   oxygen rich nanoparticles within a ferritic matrix in Fe-14Cr-2W-0.1Ti
   oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) steel. This study investigates
   whether artifacts associated with APT analysis are the cause of a
   sub-stoichiometric oxide composition measurement. Bulk Y2O3 is analyzed
   by APT, thus demonstrating the ability of the technique to measure
   near-stoichiometric composition measurements in insulating oxides.
   Through analysis of the sequence of ion hits on the detector during APT
   data acquisition, it is shown that a proportion of yttrium hits are
   spatially correlated but oxygen hits are not. Y-O based nanoparticles in
   a ferritic matrix are analyzed by APT using voltage pulsing and a laser
   pulsing with a range of laser energies from 0.3-0.8 nJ. When the
   material is analyzed using a high effective evaporation field, this
   influences the effect of trajectory aberrations, and the apparent size
   of the nanoparticles is reduced. Some reduction in Y:O ratio is
   observed, caused by high instances of multiple-ion evaporation events.
   From a detailed comparison between the results of APT analysis of the
   bulk Y2O3, the nanoparticles in the ODS material are concluded to have
   an approximate Y:O ratio of 1:1. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We consider uplink random access for which slotted Aloha has usually
   been employed with unknown channel conditions. Upon failure of a
   transmission attempt, a user cannot tell whether the failure was caused
   by collision with other simultaneously transmitting users or by his use
   of insufficient transmit power. If a transmission attempt failed due to
   collision which could have been resolved by retransmission, increasing
   transmit power would just waste power and, moreover, reduce the other
   users' chance of successful access. To handle this lack of information
   on the cause of failure, we propose a novel Cause-of-Failure resolution,
   where the transmit power is increased after a given number of
   consecutive unsuccessful access attempts when the probability that a
   given failure is caused by collision becomes sufficiently low. To
   exploit the thus-obtained transmit power for the next random access
   attempt, we also determine the Cause-of-Success based on the number of
   consecutive successful attempts, i.e., whether to (probabilistically)
   decrease or maintain the current transmit power. This way, users can
   adjust their transmit power for random access, which we call Auto Power
   Fallback (APF), considered as an advanced version of the power ramping
   algorithm. We evaluate APF by modeling analysis and numerical
   computation based on the slotted Aloha, showing that APF determines a
   suitable transmit power for uplink random accesses while achieving good
   performance. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A combined numerical and experimental study of two- and
   three-dimensional pitching and plunging flat plates at. Reynolds numbers
   of O(10(4)) is presented. The focus of this paper is the interplay
   between the geometry, kinematics, Reynolds numbers, and
   three-dimensional effects with the resulting aerodynamic forces and flow
   structures. A shallow-stall and a deep-stall motion with higher maximum
   effective angles of attacks are considered. Under both kinematic
   motions, massive leading-edge separation is observed at the sharp
   leading edge of the flat plate. This geometric effect is seen to
   dominate over other viscosity effects, and the Reynolds number
   dependence is limited. Compared with the blunter SD7003 airfoil, where
   the flow is mostly attached for the shallow-stall motion at Re = 6 x
   10(4), the sharper leading edge of the flat plate leads to earlier and
   stronger leading-edge vortex formation and greater lift and drag.
   Finally, the presence of a tip vortex significantly reduces lift
   generation during the downstroke of an aspect ratio 2 flat plate
   undergoing the shallow-stall motion. During the upstroke, the tip vortex
   is weaker and the force on the aspect ratio 2 wing can be approximated
   by its two-dimensional counterpart.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for concurrent mesh and polynomial-order
   adaptation with the objective of direct minimization of output error
   using a selection process for choosing the optimal refinement option
   from a discrete set of choices that includes directional spatial
   resolution and approximation order increment. The scheme is geared
   toward compressible viscous aerodynamic flows, in which various solution
   features make certain refinement options more efficient than others. No
   attempt is made, however, to measure the solution anisotropy or
   smoothness directly or to incorporate it into the scheme. Rather, mesh
   anisotropy and approximation order distribution arise naturally from the
   optimization of a merit function that incorporates both an output
   sensitivity and a measure of solution cost on the new mesh. The method
   is applied to output-based adaptive simulations of laminar and
   Reynolds-averaged compressible Navier-Stokes equations on body-fitted
   meshes in two and three dimensions. Two-dimensional results show
   significant reductions in the degrees of freedom and computational time
   to achieve output convergence when discrete choice optimization is used
   compared to uniform h or p refinement. Three-dimensional results show
   that the presented method is an affordable way of achieving output
   convergence on difficult cases such as the third AIAA Drag Prediction
   Workshop W1 configuration.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the energy utilization efficiency of gasoline
   engine and predict the recovery potential for waste heat energy, energy
   distribution and waste heat energy characteristics of a naturally
   aspirated gasoline engine have been studied by combining the methods of
   energy and exergy analysis. During the research processes, engine energy
   balance tests were conducted under mapping characteristics, and the
   parameters required for calculating the energy balance and exergy
   balance were measured. On this basis, waste heat recovery potential and
   gasoline engine total exergy efficiency were studied by using the method
   of exergy analysis. Research results show: at low-speed and low-load,
   waste heat energy mainly focuses on cooling water; at high-speed and
   high-load, exhaust gas energy is larger than cooling water energy not
   only in quantity, but also in exergy percentage and exergy efficiency;
   the highest exhaust gas exergy efficiency appears in high-speed and
   high-load area, while the highest cooling water exergy efficiency
   appears in low-speed and low-load area; theoretically, total fuel
   efficiency of this gasoline engine can be nearly improved by a time
   through waste heat recovery, and the maximum total fuel efficiency can
   reach 60\%. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of
   breast cancer with limited treatment options. Epidermal growth factor
   receptor I (EGFR) has emerged as a promising target in TNBC. Limited
   success of the EGFR kinase inhibiting small molecules in clinical trials
   may be attributed in part to inaccuracy in identifying EGFR signatures
   in patient tumors. In light of the absence of a simple correlation
   between EGFR expression and its degree of activation, a simple and
   reliable tool that can quantify EGFR kinase activity in tumor samples
   may be of therapeutic value in predicting patient-specific EGFR targeted
   therapies. This study reports the development of an assay that can
   quantitatively profile EGFR kinase activities and inhibitor
   sensitivities in TNBC cell lysates by using peptide reporters covalently
   tethered to magnetic beads in a controlled orientation. The use of
   magnetic beads provides rapid sample handling and easy product
   isolation. The potential of this approach was demonstrated by screening
   a set of five clinically relevant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
   Formatted for microwell plates, this magnetic bead-based kinase assay
   may be used as a complementary approach for direct high-throughput
   screening of small molecule inhibitors.}},

   printed metamaterial unit cells exhibiting anisotropic effective
   material parameters, while the surrounding medium consists of printed
   isotropic unit cells. The measured and simulated field patterns within
   the beam-shifting slab and the surrounding media are compared and show
   excellent agreement. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate
   that radiation from a cylindrical source is shifted upward by 5.28 unit
   cells due to the presence of the beam-shifting slab. Furthermore, the
   wide-band frequency response of the slab is experimentally studied. The
   reported experimental results verify the theory behind tensor
   transmission-line metamaterials and demonstrate their utility in the

Abstract = {{This paper considers three problems in sparse filter design, the first
   involving a weighted least-squares constraint on the frequency response,
   the second a constraint on mean squared error in estimation, and the
   third a constraint on signal-to-noise ratio in detection. The three
   problems are unified under a single framework based on sparsity
   maximization under a quadratic performance constraint. Efficient and
   exact solutions are developed for specific cases in which the matrix in
   the quadratic constraint is diagonal, block-diagonal, banded, or has low
   condition number. For the more difficult general case, a low-complexity
   algorithm based on backward greedy selection is described with emphasis
   on its efficient implementation. Examples in wireless channel
   equalization and minimum-variance distortionless-response beamforming
   show that the backward selection algorithm yields optimally sparse
   designs in many instances while also highlighting the benefits of sparse
   design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an exact algorithm for sparse filter design under a
   quadratic constraint on filter performance. The algorithm is based on
   branch-and-bound, a combinatorial optimization procedure that can either
   guarantee an optimal solution or produce a sparse solution with a bound
   on its deviation from optimality. To reduce the complexity of
   branch-and-bound, several methods are developed for bounding the optimal
   filter cost. Bounds based on infeasibility yield incrementally
   accumulating improvements with minimal computation, while two convex
   relaxations, referred to as linear and diagonal relaxations, are derived
   to provide stronger bounds. The approximation properties of the two
   relaxations are characterized analytically as well as numerically.
   Design examples involving wireless channel equalization and
   minimum-variance distortionless-response beamforming show that the
   complexity of obtaining certifiably optimal solutions can often be
   significantly reduced by incorporating diagonal relaxations, especially
   in more difficult instances. In the case of early termination due to
   computational constraints, diagonal relaxations strengthen the bound on
   the proximity of the final solution to the optimum.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable porous scaffolds have been investigated as an alternative
   approach to current metal, ceramic, and polymer bone graft substitutes
   for lost or damaged bone tissues. Although there have been many studies
   investigating the effects of scaffold architecture on bone formation,
   many of these scaffolds were fabricated using conventional methods such
   as salt leaching and phase separation, and were constructed without
   designed architecture. To study the effects of both designed
   architecture and material on bone formation, this study designed and
   fabricated three types of porous scaffold architecture from two
   biodegradable materials, poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and 50:50
   Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), using image based design and
   indirect solid freeform fabrication techniques, seeded them with bone
   morphogenetic protein-7 transduced human gingival fibroblasts, and
   implanted them subcutaneously into mice for 4 and 8weeks. Micro-computed
   tomography data confirmed that the fabricated porous scaffolds
   replicated the designed architectures. Histological analysis revealed
   that the 50:50 PLGA scaffolds degraded but did not maintain their
   architecture after 4weeks implantation. However, PLLA scaffolds
   maintained their architecture at both time points and showed improved
   bone ingrowth, which followed the internal architecture of the
   scaffolds. Mechanical properties of both PLLA and 50:50 PLGA scaffolds
   decreased but PLLA scaffolds maintained greater mechanical properties
   than 50:50 PLGA after implantation. The increase of mineralized tissue
   helped support the mechanical properties of bone tissue and scaffold
   constructs between 48weeks. The results indicate the importance of
   choice of scaffold materials and computationally designed scaffolds to
   control tissue formation and mechanical properties for desired bone
   tissue regeneration. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{One of the main objectives of the structural health monitoring community
   is to continuously monitor the integrity of a structure by embedding
   sensors and actuators into the structure. A piezoelectrically driven
   beam is considered in the present work and the effect of the growth of a
   single crack on the vibratory characteristics of the beam is studied. It
   is shown that in order to combine the effect of a crack and the
   piezoceramic (PZT) actuator into the modeling, available formulations of
   the mode shapes of the cracked beam, such as modeling the beam as a
   bi-section connected with a rotational spring, are not applicable as
   they are not twice differentiable. A new formulation of the mode shapes
   of the cracked beam is introduced here by applying the Rayleigh-Ritz
   method. The effect of location and depth of the crack on the vibratory
   response of the beam is modeled through formulating the loss of energy
   due to the presence of the crack, which is approximated here as a
   massless rotational spring. It is shown that the proposed crack modeling
   provides a close approximation of the mode shapes of the cracked beam.
   This modeling approach is beneficial as it provides twice-differentiable
   mode shapes for the cracked beam and can be used as trial functions in
   the assumed mode approximations. Numerical analysis is also provided for
   various design parameters, such as crack depth and position and the
   location of the PZT patch.}},

Abstract = {{Biological processes and behaviors of endothelial cells on the inner
   surfaces of blood vessels are regulated by the stimulation from
   biochemical signals contained in the blood. In this paper, the
   transportation of dynamic biochemical signals in non-reversing
   oscillatory flows in blood vessels is analyzed by numerically solving a
   nonlinear governing equation for the time-dependent Taylor-Aris
   dispersion. Results show that the nonlinear frequency-amplitude
   modulation of the transportation of biochemical signals is more (less)
   significant when the frequency of an oscillatory flow is close to
   (higher than) that of an oscillatory signal. Under steady flow, the
   transfer function for the signal transmission system is obtained,
   showing that the system is a low-pass filter. Lower inner radius or
   higher center-line velocity of a blood vessel increases the cutoff
   frequency of the transportation system. These results suggest the
   possibility and condition for the `remote' transmission of low-frequency
   dynamic biochemical signals in pulsatile blood flows.}},

Title = {{The Objective Assessment of Experts' and Novices' Suturing Skills Using
   An Image Analysis Program}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To objectively assess suturing performance using an image analysis
   program and to provide validity evidence for this assessment method by
   comparing experts' and novices' performance.
   Method
   In 2009, the authors used an image analysis program to extract objective
   variables from digital images of suturing end products obtained during a
   previous study involving third-year medical students (novices) and
   surgical faculty and residents (experts). Variables included number of
   stitches, stitch length, total bite size, travel, stitch orientation,
   total bite-size-to-travel ratio, and symmetry across the incision ratio.
   The authors compared all variables between groups to detect significant
   differences and two variables (total bite-size-to-travel ratio and
   symmetry across the incision ratio) to ideal values.
   Results
   Five experts and 15 novices participated. Experts' and novices'
   performances differed significantly (P < .05) with large effect sizes
   attributable to experience (Cohen d > 0.8) for total bite size (P =
   .009, d = 1.5), travel (P = .045, d = 1.1), total bite-size-to-travel
   ratio (P < .0001, d = 2.6), stitch orientation (P = .014, d = 1.4), and
   symmetry across the incision ratio (P = .022, d = 1.3).
   Conclusions
   The authors found that a simple computer algorithm can extract variables
   from digital images of a running suture and rapidly provide quantitative
   summative assessment feedback. The significant differences found between
   groups confirm that this system can discriminate between skill levels.
   This image analysis program represents a viable training tool for
   objectively assessing trainees' suturing, a foundational skill for many
   medical specialties.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental and numerical study
   on the low-velocity impact behavior of foam-core sandwich panels. Panels
   with polyurethane foam core and plain weave carbon fabric laminated
   face-sheets were subjected to low-velocity impact with hemispherical
   steel impactors of different diameters at various energy levels. Digital
   image correlation technique (a non-contact measuring system) was used to
   measure the real-time displacement and velocity of the impactor, and the
   back surface out-of-plane panel deflection time-history. A load sensor
   was used to record the contact force time-history. Non-destructive
   inspection and destructive sectioning methods were used to evaluate the
   internal and external damage on the sandwich panels after impact. The
   effects of impact variables such as impactor diameter, impact energy,
   and sandwich panel configuration parameters, such as facesheet thickness
   and foam core thickness on the impact behavior and resulting impact
   damage states were studied. Based on the generalized Schapery theory, a
   progressive damage model is developed to describe the nonlinear behavior
   of plain weave carbon laminates during impact. The foam core was modeled
   as a crushable foam material. Coupon tests were conducted to determine
   the input parameters for the progressive damage model and the foam
   crushing properties. Three-dimensional finite element models were
   implemented to analyze the impact response incorporating the progressive
   damage model. Results from the numerical models were found to agree well
   with experimental observations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of surrounding boundaries on the
   free vibration response of fully and partially submerged cantilevered
   composite plates and how these effects change due to material
   anisotropy. The results show that added mass significantly reduces the
   natural frequencies of cantilevered marine structures as a function of
   relative submergence depth, more so for composite plates than for steel
   plates because of the much lower ratio of effective structural mass to
   hydrodynamic added mass. Added mass effects are most dramatic for
   partially submerged plates as the plates move from being above to
   completely beneath the free surface. Free surface effects are shown to
   become negligible for a fully submerged plate parallel to the free
   surface when the depth of submergence exceeds 50\% of the plate length.
   Solid boundaries are found to have limited effects for fully-submerged
   plates near a wall, where maximum decreases in resonance frequencies due
   to increases in added mass are only a few percent. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Motion-compensated image reconstruction (MCIR) methods incorporate
   motion models to improve image quality in the presence of motion. MCIR
   methods differ in terms of how they use motion information and they have
   been well studied separately. However, there have been less theoretical
   comparisions of different MCIR methods. This paper compares the
   theoretical noise properties of three popular MCIR methods assuming
   known nonrigid motion. We show the relationship among three MCIR
   methods-motion-compensated temporal regularization (MTR), the parametric
   motion model (PMM), and post-reconstruction motion correction (PMC)-for
   penalized weighted least square cases. These analyses show that PMM and
   MTR are matrix-weighted sums of all registered image frames, while PMC
   is a scalar-weighted sum. We further investigate the noise properties of
   MCIR methods with Poisson models and quadratic regularizers by deriving
   accurate and fast variance prediction formulas using an ``analytical
   approach.{''} These theoretical noise analyses show that the variances
   of PMM and MTR are lower than or comparable to the variance of PMC due
   to the statistical weighting. These analyses also facilitate comparisons
   of the noise properties of different MCIR methods, including the effects
   of different quadratic regularizers, the influence of the motion through
   its Jacobian determinant, and the effect of assuming that total activity
   is preserved. Two-dimensional positron emission tomography simulations
   demonstrate the theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{Compensating for the collimator-detector response (CDR) in SPECT is
   important for accurate quantification. The CDR consists of both a
   geometric response and a septal penetration and collimator scatter
   response. The geometric response can be modeled analytically and is
   often used for modeling the whole CDR if the geometric response
   dominates. However, for radionuclides that emit medium or high-energy
   photons such as I-131, the septal penetration and collimator scatter
   response is significant and its modeling in the CDR correction is
   important for accurate quantification. There are two main methods for
   modeling the depth-dependent CDR so as to include both the geometric
   response and the septal penetration and collimator scatter response. One
   is to fit a Gaussian plus exponential function that is rotationally
   invariant to the measured point source response at several
   source-detector distances. However, a rotationally-invariant exponential
   function cannot represent the star-shaped septal penetration tails in
   detail. Another is to perform Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations to generate
   the depth-dependent point spread functions (PSFs) for all necessary
   distances. However, MC simulations, which require careful modeling of
   the SPECT detector components, can be challenging and accurate results
   may not be available for all of the different SPECT scanners in clinics.
   In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to CDR modeling. We
   use a Gaussian function plus a 2-D B-spline PSF template and fit the
   model to measurements of an I-131 point source at several distances. The
   proposed PSF-template-based approach is nearly non-parametric, captures
   the characteristics of the septal penetration tails, and minimizes the
   difference between the fitted and measured CDR at the distances of
   interest. The new model is applied to I-131 SPECT reconstructions of
   experimental phantom measurements, a patient study, and a MC patient
   simulation study employing the XCAT phantom. The proposed model yields
   up to a 16.5 and 10.8\% higher recovery coefficient compared to the
   results with the conventional Gaussian model and the Gaussian plus
   exponential model, respectively.}},

Title = {{Controlled Cavitation to Augment SWL Stone Comminution: Mechanistic
   Insights In Vitro}},

Abstract = {{Stone comminution in shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) has been documented to
   result from mechanical stresses conferred directly to the stone, as well
   as the activity of cavitational microbubbles. Studies have demonstrated
   that the presence of this cavitation activity is crucial for stone
   subdivision; however, its exact role in the comminution process remains
   somewhat weakly defined, in part because it is difficult to isolate the
   cavitational component from the shock waves themselves. In this study,
   we further explored the importance of cavitation in SWL stone
   comminution through the use of histotripsy ultrasound therapy.
   Histotripsy was used to target model stones designed to mimic the
   mid-range tensile fracture strength of naturally occurring cystine
   calculi with controlled cavitation at strategic time points in the SWL
   comminution process. All SWL was applied at a peak positive pressure
   (p+) of 34 MPa and a peak negative pressure (p-) of 8 MPa; a shock rate
   of 1 Hz was used. Histotripsy pulses had a p-of 33 MPa and were applied
   at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 100 Hz. Ten model stones were
   sonicated in vitro with each of five different treatment schemes: A) 10
   min of SWL (600 shocks) with 0.7 s of histotripsy interleaved between
   successive shocks (totaling to 42 000 pulses); B) 10 min of SWL (600
   shocks) followed by 10 min of histotripsy applied in 0.7-s bursts (1
   burst per second, totaling to 42 000 pulses); C) 10 min of histotripsy
   applied in 0.7-s bursts (42 000 pulses) followed by 10 min of SWL (600
   shocks); D) 10 min of SWL only (600 shocks); E) 10 min of histotripsy
   only, applied in 0.7-s bursts (42 000 pulses). Following sonication,
   debris was collected and sieved through 8-, 6-, 4-, and 2-mm filters. It
   was found that scheme D, SWL only, generated a broad range of fragment
   sizes, with an average of 14.9 +/- 24.1\% of the original stone mass
   remaining > 8 mm. Scheme E, histotripsy only, eroded the surface of
   stones to tiny particulate debris that was small enough to pass through
   the finest filter used in this study (< 2 mm), leaving behind a single
   primary stone piece (> 8 mm) with mass 85.1 +/- 1.6\% of the original
   following truncated sonication. The combination of SWL and histotripsy
   (schemes A, B, and C) resulted in a shift in the size distribution
   toward smaller fragments and complete elimination of debris > 8 mm. When
   histotripsy-controlled cavitation was applied following SWL (B), the
   increase in exposed stone surface area afforded by shock wave stone
   subdivision led to enhanced cavitation erosion. When
   histotripsy-controlled cavitation was applied before SWL (C), it is
   likely that stone surface defects induced by cavitation erosion provided
   sites for crack nucleation and accelerated shock wave stone subdivision.
   Both of these effects are likely at play in the interleaved therapy (A),
   although shielding of shock waves by remnant histotripsy microbubble
   nuclei may have limited the efficacy of this scheme. Nevertheless, these
   results demonstrate the important role played by cavitation in the stone
   comminution process, and suggest that the application of controlled
   cavitation at strategic time points can provide an adjunct to
   traditional SWL therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Arterial spin labeling (ASL) provides quantitative and reproducible
   measurements of regional cerebral blood flow, and is therefore an
   attractive method for functional MRI. However, most existing ASL
   functional MRI protocols are based on either two-dimensional (2D)
   multislice or 3D spin-echo and suffer from very low image
   signal-to-noise ratio or through-plane blurring. 3D ASL with multishot
   (segmented) readouts can improve the signal-to-noise ratio efficiency
   relative to 2D multislice and does not suffer from T2-blurring. However,
   segmented readouts require lower imaging flip-angles and may increase
   the susceptibility to temporal signal fluctuations (e.g., due to
   physiology) relative to 2D multislice. In this article, we characterize
   the temporal signal-to-noise ratio of a segmented 3D spiral ASL
   sequence, and investigate the effects of radiofrequency phase cycling
   scheme and flip-angle schedule on image properties. We show that
   radiofrequency-spoiling is essential in segmented 3D spiral ASL, and
   that 3D ASL can improve temporal signal-to-noise ratio 2-fold relative
   to 2D multislice when using a simple polynomial (cubic) flip-angle
   schedule. Functional MRI results using the proposed optimized segmented
   3D spiral ASL protocol show excellent activation in the visual cortex.

Title = {{Development of a novel approach to safely couple the intestine to a

Abstract = {{Distraction-induced intestinal growth may be a novel treatment for short
   bowel syndrome. Longitudinal, distractive tension created by the
   application of force creates a significant challenge: to produce
   adequate force, yet not cause perforation at the fixation points. This
   paper describes our development of a coupling strategy to allow for
   successful bowel lengthening.
   A curvilinear hydraulic device was implanted in an isolated Roux limb of
   small bowel in young Yorkshire pigs. Bowel was lengthened over a 2-week
   period. Study groups included: Group 1: Twelve silk transmural anchoring
   sutures into an engineered-coupling ring at the ends of each device.
   Group 2: Addition of felt pledgets to the coupling rings on the serosal
   surface of the small bowel. Group 3: Extraluminal use of either thin
   AlloDerm(A (R)), thick AlloDerm(A (R)), or Strattice (TM) mesh to anchor
   the device.
   Group 1 (suture-only) resulted in a gradual pulling through the suture
   with increasing tension and no lengthening. Felt pledgets eroded in a
   similar fashion, causing abdominal sepsis. Thin AlloDerm(A (R)) failed
   to prevent erosion; however, it protected against gross contamination.
   Animals in which either thick AlloDerm(A (R)) or Strattice (TM) mesh was
   used survived complication free to the study endpoint. Both thick
   AlloDerm(A (R)) and Strattice (TM) prevented erosion and perforation
   allowing for an average of 10.85 cm expansion.
   This study demonstrates the use of either thick AlloDerm(A (R)) or
   Strattice (TM) reconstructive tissue matrix which allows for safe and
   effective coupling. Further, we suggest this approach could be an
   adjunct to esophageal lengthening procedures.}},

Abstract = {{To move beyond colorant-based pigmentation display technologies, a
   variety of photonic and plasmonic crystal based structures have been
   designed and applied as colour filters. Nanostructure based colour
   filtering offers increased efficiencies, low power consumption, slim

   still needs to be improved. In this work, we propose a new scheme
   through localized resonance in metallic nanoslits by light funneling.
   Angle insensitive colour filters up to +/- 80 degrees have been
   achieved, capable of wide colour tunability across the entire visible
   band with pixel size beyond the diffraction limit (similar to lambda/2).
   This work opens the door to angle insensitive manipulation of light with

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{190}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the first time to obtain
   static pull-in voltages with fringing field effects in electrostatically
   actuated cantilever and clamped-clamped micro-beams where the mid-plane
   stretching and the residual axial load are taken into account for
   clamped-clamped boundary conditions. The non-classical Euler-Bernoulli
   beam model containing one material length scale parameter is adopted to
   effectively capture the size effect. In the solution procedure, the
   governing fourth-order differential equation of variable coefficients is
   converted into a Fredholm integral equation. By adopting the first
   natural mode of the cantilever and clamped-clamped micro-beams as a
   deflection shape function, the resulting equation is solved for the
   static pull-in voltages. The accuracy of the present analytical
   closed-form solution is verified through comparing with the
   experimentally measured and numerical data conducted in the published
   works. From the experimental data available in the literature, the value
   of the material length scale parameter for the (poly)silicon is
   estimated to be in the order of magnitude of 10(-1) mu m. Then, the
   effect of the material length scale parameter on the pull-in voltages of
   the cantilever and clamped-clamped micro-beams is investigated. The
   results indicate that the tensile residual stress can extend the
   validity range of the classical continuum mechanics to lower beam
   thicknesses. It is also found that microcantilever beams are more
   sensitive to the size effect than their corresponding clamped-clamped
   micro-beams. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been extensively explored for
   drug delivery applications due to their safety, immunomodulatory
   properties, and ability to differentiate into new tissues. The
   experiments presented in this study were designed to determine
   peptide-based mechanisms to increase the adenoviral transduction of
   hMSCs for the purpose of improving their capacity as drug delivery
   vehicles. Specifically, we demonstrated that cyclic- RGD peptides
   increased the internalization of adenoviruses into MSCs. MSCs treated
   with cyclic- RGD peptides had a transduction efficiency of 76.6\% +/-
   4\%, which was significantly greater than the 23.5\% +/- 12.2\%
   transduction efficiency of untreated stem cells (P < 0.05). Blocking
   endocytosis with inhibitors of dynamin or actin polymerization decreased
   the cyclic-RGD-mediated increase in transduction efficiency. MSCs
   treated with cyclic- RGD and adenoviruses carrying the gene for bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 produced significantly greater concentrations of
   this growth factor compared to stem cells treated with only adenoviruses
   or adenoviruses cocultured with cyclic-RAD peptides. Furthermore, this
   stem cell-produced bone morphogenetic protein induced alkaline
   phosphatase expression in C2C12 cells indicating growth factor
   bioactivity. Taken together, these studies suggest that cyclic- RGD
   peptides could be used to increase the adenoviral transduction of hMSCs
   and increase their therapeutic potential.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and evaluation of magnetoelastic sensors
   intended for wireless monitoring of tissue accumulation in peripheral
   artery stents. The sensors are fabricated from 28 mu m thick foils of
   magnetoelastic 2826MB Metglas(TM), an amorphous Ni-Fe alloy. The sensor
   layer consists of a frame and an active resonator portion. The frame
   consists of 150 mu m wide struts that are patterned in the same wishbone
   array pattern as a 12 mm x 1.46 mm Elgiloy stent cell. The active
   portion is a 10 mm long symmetric leaf shape and is anchored to the
   frame at mid length. The active portion nests within the stent cell,
   with a uniform gap separating the two. A gold-indium eutectic bonding
   process is used to bond Metglas(TM) and Elgiloy foils, which are
   subsequently patterned to form bi-layer resonators. The response of the
   sensor to viscosity changes and mass loading that precede and accompany
   artery occlusion is tested in vitro. The typical sensitivity to
   viscosity of the fundamental, longitudinal resonant frequency at 361 kHz
   is 427 ppm cP(-1) over a 1.1-8.6 cP range. The sensitivity to mass
   loading is typically between 63000 and 65000 ppm mg(-1) with the
   resonant frequency showing a reduction of 8.1\% for an applied mass that
   is 15\% of the unloaded mass of the sensor. This is in good agreement
   with the theoretical response.}},

   number nonpremixed jet flame}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cinematographic stereoscopic PIV with temporal and spatial resolution
   ranging from 2.6 to 5.5 Kolmogorov scales, which is sufficient to
   accurately represent most of the dissipation structures, is used in
   conjunction with Taylor's frozen flow hypothesis to generate
   quasi-instantaneous pseudo-volumes of the three-component velocity field
   in the far-field of a nonpremixed jet flame at the jet exit Reynolds
   number (Re-d) of 8000. The 3D data enable the computation of the nine
   components of the velocity gradient tensor and other important kinematic
   quantities. The volumetric PIV is combined with single-shot simultaneous
   OH PLIF imaging to mark the instantaneous reaction zone at one plane in
   the reconstructed volume. The combined datasets enable the investigation
   of the relationship between the reaction zone and the fully-3D
   representations of strain, vorticity, kinetic energy dissipation and
   dilatation, and of the impact of heat release on the structure of
   turbulence. In this Re-d = 8000 flame, it is observed that sheet-like
   layers of vorticity and dissipation tend to coincide and are aligned
   with the OH layers, an effect that is believed to be due to the
   stabilizing effect of heat release on this relatively low Reynolds
   number jet flame. Furthermore, the spatial organization of the strain
   field is predominantly driven by the presence of the flame rather than
   turbulence. Finally, intense dissipation is mostly due to the laminar
   shear caused by the presence of the flame rather than to the strain
   generated by vortical structures as typically observed in nonreacting
   jets.}},

Abstract = {{Alloy 617 is a candidate material for the intermediate heat exchanger of
   the He-cooled very high temperature reactor. At target temperatures a
   parts per thousand yen1223 K (950 A degrees C), low level impurities in
   the gas stream may cause carburization, decarburization, and/or
   oxidation of 617 with deleterious effects on its mechanical properties.
   The chromia scale formed naturally by 617 does not provide adequate
   protection in the expected environment. Alpha alumina offers a greater
   potential as an effective diffusion barrier with superior stability, but
   it requires modification of the alloy surface. This work explores two
   approaches to surface modification based on aluminizing, either alone or
   in combination with FeCrAlY cladding, followed by pre-oxidation to form
   alpha alumina. Both approaches yield coatings with promising diffusional
   stability on alloy 617. Initial corrosion studies in impure He
   environments reveal that the alpha alumina is stable and protects the
   underlying substrate in both carburizing and decarburizing environments.}},

Abstract = {{The winner-take-all (WTA) competition is widely observed in both
   inanimate and biological media and society. Many mathematical models are
   proposed to describe the phenomena discovered in different fields. These
   models are capable of demonstrating the WTA competition. However, they
   are often very complicated due to the compromise with experimental
   realities in the particular fields; it is often difficult to explain the
   underlying mechanism of such a competition from the perspective of
   feedback based on those sophisticate models. In this paper, we make
   steps in that direction and present a simple model, which produces the
   WTA competition by taking advantage of selective positive-negative
   feedback through the interaction of neurons via p-norm. Compared to
   existing models, this model has an explicit explanation of the
   competition mechanism. The ultimate convergence behavior of this model
   is proven analytically. The convergence rate is discussed and
   simulations are conducted in both static and dynamic competition
   scenarios. Both theoretical and numerical results validate the
   effectiveness of the dynamic equation in describing the nonlinear
   phenomena of WTA competition.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To confirm findings from an earlier report showing that
   neoadjuvant (NA) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) halving time (PSAHT)
   impacts biochemical failure (BF) rates, and to examine its association
   with prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), in a large prospective
   cohort of patients.
   Methods and Materials: A total of 502 patients were selected from a
   prospective database, who had localized prostate adenocarcinoma treated
   with 2-12 months of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (N-ADT)
   followed by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) between 1994 and
   2000, and had at least 2 NA PSA values. Seventy-four percent of patients
   had high-risk prostate cancer. Median initial PSA value, N-ADT duration,
   total ADT duration, and radiation therapy dose were 14 ng/mL, 6.9
   months, 10.8 months, and 68 Gy, respectively.
   Results: At a median follow-up of 9.9 years, 210 patients have had a BF.
   Median PSAHT was 18 days. On univariate analysis, PSAHT was not shown to
   predict for BF (P=.69) or PCSS (P=.28). However, NA nadir PSA (nanPSA)
   and post-therapy nadir PSA (ptnPSA), when analyzed as continuous or
   categoric variables, predicted for BF (P<.001) and PCSS (P<.001). On
   multivariate analysis, nanPSA (P=.037) and ptnPSA (P<.001) continued to
   be significantly associated with BF. However, N-ADT duration lost
   significance (P=.67), and PSAHT remained a nonsignificant predictor
   (P=.97). For PCSS, multivariate analysis showed nanPSA (P=.049) and
   ptnPSA (P<.001) to be significant. Again PSAHT (P=.49) remained
   nonsignificant.
   Conclusions: In this large, prospective cohort of patients, NA PSA
   kinetics, expressed as PSAHT, did not predict BF or PCSS. However, nadir
   PSAs, in both the NA and post-therapy settings, were significant
   predictors of BF and PCSS. Optimization of therapy could potentially be
   based on early PSA response, with shorter durations of ADT for those
   predicted to do favorably, and intensification of therapy for those
   likely to have poorer outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.}},

Volume = {{102}},

Abstract = {{The long-term success of in situ reductive immobilization of uranium (U)
   depends on the stability of U(IV) precipitates (e. g., uraninite) in the
   presence of natural oxidants, such as oxygen, Fe(III) hydroxides, and
   nitrite. Field and laboratory studies have implicated iron sulfide
   minerals as redox buffers or oxidant scavengers that may slow oxidation
   of reduced U(IV) solid phases. Yet, the inhibition mechanism(s) and
   reaction rates of uraninite (UO2) oxidative dissolution by oxic species
   such as oxygen in FeS-bearing systems remain largely unresolved. To
   address this knowledge gap, abiotic batch experiments were conducted
   with synthetic UO2 in the presence and absence of synthetic mackinawite
   (FeS) under simulated groundwater conditions of pH = 7, P-O2 = 0.02 atm,
   and P-CO2 = 0.05 atm. The kinetic profiles of dissolved uranium indicate
   that FeS inhibited UO2 dissolution for about 51 h by effectively
   scavenging oxygen and keeping dissolved oxygen (DO) low. During this
   time period, oxidation of structural Fe(II) and S(-II) of FeS were found
   to control the DO levels, leading to the formation of iron oxyhydroxides
   and elemental sulfur, respectively, as verified by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), Mossbauer, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). After FeS was
   depleted due to oxidation, DO levels increased and UO2 oxidative
   dissolution occurred at an initial rate of r(m) = 1.2 +/- 0.4 x 10(-8)
   mol g(-1) s(-1), higher than r(m) = 5.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(-9) mol g(-1) s(-1)
   in the control experiment where FeS was absent. XAS analysis confirmed
   that soluble U(VI)-carbonato complexes were adsorbed by iron
   oxyhydroxides (i.e., nanogoethite and lepidocrocite) formed from FeS
   oxidation, which provided a sink for U(VI) retention. This work reveals
   that both the oxygen scavenging by FeS and the adsorption of U(VI) to
   FeS oxidation products may be important in U reductive immobilization
   systems subject to redox cycling events. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Neutron coincidence counting is widely used in nuclear safeguards.
   Simulations of these systems can be performed using Monte Carlo codes
   such as MCNPX to aid in calibration or measurement design. However, the
   MCNPX coincidence-counting routines treat particle histories
   individually, therefore the dead time of the acquisition electronics is
   not treated. The MCNPX-PoliMi code provides the ability to model
   detailed effects such as data-acquisition electronics and system dead
   times. A specialized postprocessing code has been developed to interpret
   the collision-log file and determine the response of a He-3 multiplicity
   counter. The MCNPX-PoliMi simulation provides the full neutron
   multiplicity distribution measured by the He-3 tubes. This distribution
   is used to compute the singles, doubles, and triples rates which are the
   quantities used to determine U-235 mass. MCNPX-PoliMi has previously
   been validated with passive multiplicity measurements. In this study, a
   detailed analysis of the measurement system operating in active mode is
   presented for uranium-oxide standards ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 kg with a
   Canberra JCC-51 active well coincidence counter. MCNPX-PoliMi
   calculations are also compared with MCNPX. The two codes agree to within
   1\% for the cases with negligible dead times. The simulations are
   validated with measurements performed at the Y-12 National Security
   Complex. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Parametrically excited nonlinear piezoelectric compact wind turbine}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{977-987}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A nonlinear piezoelectric rotary transducer is developed that makes
   compact low speed wind generators realizable. Compact wind generators
   provide power to sensor nodes in remote or hard to reach locations.
   Since the locations of the sensor nodes are not optimized in terms of
   wind speed, the compact wind generators should be able to produce power
   from low speed wind. At smaller scales piezoelectric transduction
   becomes more effective than electromagnetic transduction. Therefore one
   way of realizing the compact wind turbines is by replacing the
   electromagnetic generator with a piezoelectric transducer. This work
   presents a novel piezoelectric transducer where the rotation of the
   blades results in large oscillations of piezoelectric beams. The
   piezoelectric bimorphs are made bi-stable by incorporation of repelling
   magnetic force. The Magnetic force is due to interaction of permanent
   magnets at the tip of the beams with permanent magnets rotating with the
   blades. Since the magnetic force changes with blade rotation, the
   dynamics of the beams changes in time and the system is thus
   parametrically excited. Two configurations are presented one called
   tangential configuration and the other is radial configuration. An 80 mm
   x 80 mm x 175 mm nonlinear piezoelectric wind generator can generate
   milliwatts of power from wind as slow as 2 ms(-1). The proposed compact
   wind generators are experimentally investigated in two steps. First the
   piezoelectric transducer is examined through constant rotational speed
   tests. Second wind tunnel experiments are performed to characterize the
   entire wind generator. An analytical model is developed for the
   piezoelectric rotational transducer. The model is verified with the
   experimental results. The nonlinear phenomena captured by the
   experimental investigations are explained using the analytical model.
   The model is also used for more case studies identifying specifically
   the effect of parametric excitations. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The concept of improving the safety of rechargeable lithium sulfur
   batteries by introducing flame retardant additives (FRs) to liquid
   electrolytes is primarily reported in this paper. Dimethyl
   methylphosphonate (DMMP) is used as a flame retardant additive to
   improve the thermal safety of rechargeable lithium batteries with sulfur
   based composite cathode materials. The electrochemical compatibility
   between DMMP and sulfur cathode is investigated. With 11 wt.\% DMMP
   addition, the electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6/EC+EMC (1:1, v/v) is nearly
   nonflammable and its thermal stability is obviously improved. Cycle
   performance and electrochemical stability are little affected with an
   appropriate DMMP addition of 7-11 wt.\% by the analysis of
   electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and cycle performances. DMMP is
   a feasible choice as flame retardant additive in carbonate electrolyte
   for rechargeable lithium batteries with sulfur composite cathode
   materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Analyzing failure mechanics of fiber-reinforced media that correspond to
   different length scales with the goal of up-scaling is addressed in this
   paper with respect to compressive kinking instability in fiber
   reinforced laminae. Using the concentric cylinder model (CCM) as a
   representative element of a lamina, J2 deformation theory along with
   Hill's anisotropic plasticity theory is used to extend the constitutive
   model for the fiber-matrix cylinder, and hence the lamina, into the
   nonlinear regime. The model requires the elastic properties of fiber and
   matrix, the fiber volume fraction and the nonlinear shear response of
   the polymer matrix. An 8-layer laminate is up-scaled using this method
   by homogenizing the off-axis laminae and retaining micro-mechanics in
   the 0 degrees laminae, and results are compared against a discrete
   fiber-matrix micro-mechanical model of the laminate. The effect of
   homogenizing the laminae on the compressive response of the laminate is
   investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an efficient control strategy for a piezoelectric
   microactuator using charge recovery. For piezoelectric actuators, as
   well as other actuators that behave primarily as capacitive loads,
   energy consumption can be reduced by minimizing the number of times an
   actuator is charged and by recovering stored energy when it is turned
   OFF. An integer programming-based algorithm is used to drive
   microrobotic legs powered by piezoelectric actuators to a specified
   angle in a specified time using minimum energy. Partial charge recovery
   is incorporated; this allows the use of a more flexible controller than
   a pure ON-OFF controller, with two or more intermediate voltage levels
   between the minimum and maximum voltages available to improve
   positioning accuracy. Simulated and experimental tests show that a
   prototype piezoelectric robotic leg joint achieved controlled movements
   with one third of the energy consumed by a pure ON-OFF controller.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for the design of distributed
   controllers that achieves component swapping modularity (CSM) in control
   systems. Our approach, referred to as the direct method, is based on
   solving a bilevel optimization problem to obtain the distributed
   controller gains directly. In the previously proposed three-step method,
   the distributed controllers were obtained by matching with a precomputed
   centralized controller. To illustrate our approach, we consider an
   engine idle speed control problem, where CSM is achieved with respect to
   the throttle actuator. The results indicate that the direct method can
   significantly improve the CSM metric compared to the three-step method.
   In addition, for a certain distributed control structure, the direct
   method enables the designer to tradeoff between desired system
   performance and CSM.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new approach to represent a two-body direct correlation
   function (DCF) in order to alleviate the computational demand of
   classical density functional theory (CDFT) and enhance the predictive
   capability of the phase-field crystal (PFC) method. The approach
   utilizes a rational function fit (RFF) to approximate the two-body DCF
   in Fourier space. We use the RFF to show that short-wavelength
   contributions of the two-body DCF play an important role in determining
   the thermodynamic properties of materials. We further show that using
   the RFF to empirically parametrize the two-body DCF allows us to obtain
   the thermodynamic properties of solids and liquids that agree with the
   results of CDFT simulations with the full two-body DCF without incurring
   significant computational costs. In addition, the RFF can also be used
   to improve the representation of the two-body DCF in the PFC method.
   Last, the RFF allows for a real-space reformulation of the CDFT and PFC
   method, which enables descriptions of nonperiodic systems and the use of
   nonuniform and adaptive grids.}},

   a 2 x 2 switch pattern from a flexible mold into a UV15LV polymer bottom
   cladding. Ink-jet printing is further used to deposit a SU-8 polymer
   core layer on top. Operation of the switch is experimentally
   demonstrated up to a frequency of 1 kHz, with switching time less than
   0.5ms. The printing technique demonstrates great potential for high
   throughput, roll-to-roll fabrication of low cost photonic devices. (C)

Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{We have examined the mechanisms of droplet formation and Bi
   incorporation during molecular beam epitaxy of GaAsBi. We consider the
   role of the transition from group-V-rich to group-III-rich conditions,
   i.e., the stoichiometry threshold, in the presence of Bi. For As-rich
   GaAsBi growth, Bi acts as a surfactant, leading to the formation of
   droplet-free GaAsBi films. For films within 10\% of the stoichiometric
   GaAsBi growth regime, surface Ga droplets are observed. However, for
   Ga-rich GaAsBi growth, Bi acts as an anti-surfactant, inducing Ga-Bi
   droplet formation. We propose a growth mechanism based upon the
   growth-rate-dependence of the stoichiometry threshold for GaAsBi. (C)

   Bi-terminated GaAs(001)}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{We developed a rigorous and exhaustive method for calculating the 0 K
   surface phase diagram of Bi/GaAs(001) by using density functional theory
   in conjunction with the cluster expansion formalism. In a search for
   ground- state alloy configurations of low energy surface structure
   prototypes, we found that the (2 x 1), alpha 2(2 x 4), and beta 2(2 x 4)
   structures possess only a few stable configurations, though each is
   stable over a wide range of chemical potential. In contrast, the c(4 x
   4) and (4 x 3) structures exhibit many stable configurations, suggesting
   their tendency towards configurational disorder at finite temperature.
   Monte Carlo simulations confirm a continuous disordering of the (4 x 3)
   reconstruction with increasing temperature that comes to completion well
   below typical MBE growth conditions, in contrast to the (2 x 1)
   structure, which remains ordered at high temperature. The calculated
   zero Kelvin phase diagram and finite temperature Monte Carlo results are
   in excellent agreement with STM in this work and experimental
   observations seen elsewhere. Furthermore, these results provide
   important insights into challenges posed by growth of GaAsBi alloys,
   namely Bi incorporation, CuPtB ordering, and Bi clustering. DOI:

Abstract = {{To devise a reliable strategy for achieving specific HOMO and LUMO
   energy level modulation via alternating donor-acceptor monomer units, we
   investigate a series of conjugated polymers (CPs) in which the electron
   withdrawing power of the acceptor group is varied, while maintaining the
   same donor group and the same conjugated chain conformation. Through
   experiment and DFT calculations, good correlation is identified between
   the withdrawing strength of the acceptor group, the HOMO and LUMO
   levels, and the degree of orbital localization, which allows reliable
   design principles for CPs. Increasing the acceptor strength results in
   an enhanced charge transfer upon combination with a donor monomer and a
   more pronounced decrease of the LUMO level. Moreover, while HOMO states
   remain delocalized along the polymer chain, LUMO states are strongly
   localized at specific bonds within the acceptor group. The degree of
   LUMO localization increases with increasing polymer length, which
   results in a further drop of the LUMO level and converges to its final
   value when the number of repeat units reaches the characteristic
   conjugation length. Based on these insights we designed PBT8PT, which
   exhibits 6.78\% power conversion efficiency after device optimization
   via the additive assisted annealing, demonstrating the effectiveness of
   our predictive design approach.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports a facile method for the fabrication of aligned
   poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) fibers and tubes based on
   electrospinning and oxidative chemical polymerization. Discrete PEDOT
   nano- and microfibers and nano- and microtubes are difficult to
   fabricate quickly and reproducibly. We employed
   poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymers that were loaded with
   polymerizable 3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer to create
   aligned nanofiber assemblies using a rotating glass mandrel during
   electrospinning. The EDOT monomer/PLGA polymer blends were then
   polymerized by exposure to an oxidative catalyst (FeCl3). PEDOT was
   polymerized by continuously dripping a FeCl3 solution onto the glass rod
   during electrospinning. The resulting PEDOT fibers were conductive,
   aligned and discrete. Fiber bundles could be easily produced in lengths
   of several centimeters. The PEDOT sheath/PLGA core fibers were immersed
   in chloroform to remove the PLGA and any residual EDOT resulting in
   hollow PEDOT tubes. This approach made it possible to easily generate
   large areas of aligned PEDOT fibers/tubes. The structure and properties
   of the aligned assemblies were measured using optical microscopy,
   electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis,
   and DC conductivity measurements. We also demonstrated that the aligned
   PEDOT sheath/PLGA core fiber assemblies could be used in supporting and
   directing the extension of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons in vitro.

Title = {{Imaging CXCL12-CXCR4 Signaling in Ovarian Cancer Therapy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{Chemokine CXCL12 and receptor CXCR4 have emerged as promising
   therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer, a disease that continues to have
   a dismal prognosis. CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling drives proliferation,
   survival, and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, leading to tumor growth
   and metastasis. Pleiotropic effects of CXCR4 in multiple key steps in
   ovarian cancer suggest that blocking this pathway will improve outcomes
   for patients with this disease. To quantify CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in
   cell-based assays and living mouse models of ovarian cancer, we
   developed a click beetle red luciferase complementation reporter that
   detects activation of CXCR4 based on recruitment of the cytosolic
   adapter protein beta-arrestin 2. Both in two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional cell cultures, we established that bioluminescence
   from this reporter measures CXCL12-dependent activation of CXCR4 and
   inhibition of this pathway with AMD3100, a clinically-approved small
   molecule that blocks CXCL12-CXCR4 binding. We used this imaging system
   to quantify CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in a mouse model of metastatic
   ovarian cancer and showed that treatment with AMD3100 interrupted this
   pathway in vivo. Combination therapy with AMD3100 and cisplatin
   significantly decreased tumor burden in mice, although differences in
   overall survival were not significantly greater than treatment with
   either agent as monotherapy. These studies establish a molecular imaging
   reporter system for analyzing CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in ovarian cancer,
   which can be used to investigate biology and therapeutic targeting of
   this pathway in cell-based assays and living mice.}},

Abstract = {{Micro dielectric barrier discharges (mDBDs) consist of micro-plasma
   devices (10-100 mu m diameter) in which the electrodes are fully or
   partially covered by dielectrics, and often operate at atmospheric
   pressure driven with radio frequency (rf) waveforms. In certain
   applications, it may be desirable to extract electron current out of the
   mDBD plasma, which necessitates a third electrode. As a result, the
   physical structure of the m-DBD and the electron emitting properties of
   its materials are important to its operation. In this paper, results
   from a two-dimensional computer simulation of current extraction from
   mDBDs sustained in atmospheric pressure N-2 will be discussed. The mDBDs
   are sandwich structures with an opening of tens-of-microns excited with
   rf voltage waveforms of up to 25MHz. Following avalanche by electron
   impact ionization in the mDBD cavity, the plasma can be expelled from
   the cavity towards the extraction electrode during the part of the rf
   cycle when the extraction electrode appears anodic. The electron current
   extraction can be enhanced by biasing this electrode. The charge
   collection can be controlled by choice of rf frequency, rf driving
   voltage, and permittivity of the dielectric barrier. (C) 2013 American

Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{The application of atmospheric-pressure plasmas to human tissue has been
   shown to have therapeutic effects for wound healing and in treatment of
   skin diseases. In this paper, we report on a computational study of the
   intersection of plasma filaments in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD)
   with a small wound in human skin in the context of plasma medicine. The
   wound is represented as a small cut in the epidermal layer of cells.
   Intracellular structures and their electrical properties were
   incorporated into the two-dimensional computational mesh in order to
   self-consistently couple gas phase plasma transport with the charging of
   the surface of the wound. We quantify the fluxes of reactive oxygen and
   nitrogen species, ions and photons produced in or diffusing into the
   wound as might occur during the first few discharge pulses of treatment.
   Comparison is made to fluxes predicted by global modelling. We show that
   the relative location of the plasma filament with respect to the wound
   is important on plasma time scales (ns) for ions and photons, and for
   radicals directly produced by electron impact processes. On the
   longer-term diffusion time scales (ms) the position of the plasma
   filament relative to the wound is not so critical. For typical DBD
   conditions, the magnitude of these fluxes to the cellular surfaces
   corresponds to fluences of radicals nearly equal to the surface site
   density. These results imply that the biological reactivity is limited
   by reaction probabilities and not the availability of radical fluxes.}},

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{135-143}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The finite approximation of a Gaussian process is incorporated
   throughout a variety of engineering applications. Central to the marine
   industry is the reconstruction of a stochastic seaway using a finite
   number of Fourier components. When coupled with Monte-Carlo methods, a
   pragmatic approach is often taken to determine an appropriate number of
   Fourier components. In this paper, an analytical solution to the
   probability distribution of a finite summation of sinusoids with
   identical amplitudes is developed and then extended to the general case.
   The resulting probability distribution is then evaluated through the
   context of extreme value theory and compared to that of a true Gaussian
   process. As might be expected, the finite approximation underpredicts
   the theoretical value by an often significant margin. The relative
   magnitude of this deviation, however, provides a theoretical basis for
   readily determining a sufficiency condition for the number of Fourier
   components to be used in any specific application. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Hypoxic conditions, defined as dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations
   below 2 mg/L, are a regular summertime occurrence in Lake Erie, but the
   spatial extent has been poorly understood due to sparse sampling. We use
   geostatistical kriging and conditional realizations to provide
   quantitative estimates of the extent of hypoxia in the central basin of
   Lake Erie for August and September of 1987 to 2007, along with their
   associated uncertainties. The applied geostatistical approach combines
   the limited in situ DO measurements with auxiliary data selected using
   the Bayesian Information Criterion. Bathymetry and longitude are found
   to be highly significant in explaining the spatial distribution of DO,
   while satellite observations of sea surface temperature and satellite
   chlorophyll are not. The hypoxic extent was generally lowest in the
   mid-1990s, with the late 1980s (1987, 1988) and the 2000s (2003, 2005)
   experiencing the largest hypoxic zones. A simple exponential
   relationship based on the squared average measured bottom DO explains
   97\% of the estimated variability in the hypoxic extent. The change in
   the observed maximum extent between August and September is found to be
   sensitive to the corresponding variability in the hypolimnion thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber reinforced elastomers subjected to compressive loads are prone to
   failure initiated by fiber buckling, a phenomenon of great technological
   importance. A 2D bifurcation analysis for an infinite ply-reinforced
   elastomer, subjected to constrained bending, is hereby presented for
   determining the composite's critical (i.e. lowest) curvature and
   associated eigenmode. The study is complemented by a full 3D analysis of
   the same composite.
   More specifically, the onset of bifurcation analysis is based on the
   Bloch wave representation of the 3D eigenmode and the periodic, over a
   2D unit cell, principal solution of the infinite, perfect composite
   subjected to constrained (i.e. its top layer is bonded to an
   inextensible metallic plate) bending. The critical curvature and
   corresponding eigenmode are found by minimizing the lowest bifurcation
   curvature as a function of the eigenmode's wavelengths. These
   semi-analytical results, based on a 2D Finite Element Method (F.E.M)
   representation of the unit cell, are found to be in remarkable agreement
   with the full 3D calculations of the corresponding imperfect composite,
   thus establishing the usefulness of the proposed analysis. A comparison
   of the numerical simulation results to some limited experimental data is
   also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Structural instability due to intercalation-induced stresses in
   electrode materials is one of the key degradation mechanisms of Li-ion
   batteries. Fragmentation of material degrades structural integrity and
   electrical resistance, and also accelerates harmful side reactions. In
   situ experiments are the appropriate approach for investigating the
   actual time-dependent nature of the behavior changes of an electrode
   material while it is charged and discharged. In the current work, a
   unique in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (ECAFM)
   measurement is made on samples of cylindrical shape, which are
   micro-machined by focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy. This pre-defined
   geometry allows the exclusion of secondary, non-active materials from
   the electrochemically active material as well as the removal of any
   vagueness owing from the irregular geometry of particles. The
   experimental results are also used to validate a proposed coupled
   electrochemical and mechanical model for determining the stress-strain
   state of active electrode material during electrochemical cycling. The
   results produced using this model correlate strongly with the
   experimental data. The combined results reveal the key effects of the
   geometry, kinetics, and mechanics of electrode materials on the
   stress-strain state, which acts as a barometer of the structural
   stability of a material. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers are used in diesel engines to
   reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides. Thermophoretic particle deposition
   occurring in EGR coolers causes a significant degradation in the cooler
   effectiveness generally followed by the stabilization of cooler
   effectiveness after long exposure times. Mechanisms responsible for this
   stabilization are not clearly understood. To investigate the
   stabilization trend, a visualization test rig was developed to track the
   dynamics of diesel exhaust soot particulate deposition and removal
   in-situ. A digital microscope records surface characteristics. A medium
   duty engine is used to generate the exhaust stream. A steady state
   condition was selected to run the engine for the deposition tests. In
   contrast to conventional understanding, large particles (tens of
   microns) were observed in diesel exhaust. Interesting results are
   observed for flaking/removal of the deposit layer during designed
   removal experiments. Water condensation at a low coolant temperature and
   bombardment of large particles resulted in a significant removal of
   deposit in the form of flakes while thermal expansion or shear force
   (low velocities) alone did not remove the deposit layer. (C) 2012

   lipid bilayer membranes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{We investigate dynamical and stationary compositional and surface
   morphologies in macroscopically phase-separating multicomponent lipid
   bilayer membranes using a computational model. We employ a phase-field
   method for the description of the coexisting phases and treat the two
   leaflets individually while including interleaflet interactions. The
   compositional evolution of the two leaflets is coupled to the shape
   evolution of the membrane via a Helfrich free energy with a
   composition-dependent spontaneous curvature. We investigate the effects
   of the interleaflet interaction on the dynamics and stationary states of
   a system favoring nonzero spontaneous curvatures. Morphological phase
   diagrams are mapped in composition space using three different
   interleaflet coupling strengths. We find that characteristics sensitive
   to the coupling strength include the time required to develop regions of
   fully separated phases, the prevalence of a stripe morphology, and the
   shifting of phase compositions to accommodate energetically favorable
   interactions across leaflets. Characteristics found to be robust with
   respect to coupling strength include (1) the stripe morphology is
   favored at nearly equal mixtures and (2) phase separation is prevented
   in systems where a pair of phases that preferentially interact across
   leaflets together occupy nearly all or none of the membrane. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, aimed to recover engine exhaust gas energy and improve
   engine thermal efficiency, various means of bottom cycles for engine
   exhaust gas energy recovery are proposed, and those include direct
   recovery means through exhaust gas expansion, such as secondary
   expansion, and indirect recovery means through heat transfer, such as
   Rankine steam cycle, Brayton air cycle, etc. The performances and
   characteristics of each bottom cycle are studied by cycle processes
   calculation and then the energy recovery potentials are compared. The
   results show that direct recovery bottom cycle through secondary
   expansion demonstrates little, if any, positive potential for a gasoline
   engine, and it only suits to diesel engine at full load with high boost
   pressure. The improvement range also differs with engine speeds and
   energy recovery potential is low. However, indirect recovery bottom
   cycles have larger applied range and higher exhaust gas energy recovery
   potential compared to direct recovery means. In all indirect recovery
   bottom cycles discussed, the maximum energy recovery potentials reduce
   in the sequence of over-heated Rankine steam cycle, standard Rankine
   steam cycle, Brayton air cycle with regeneration and standard Brayton
   air cycle. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present optical spectroscopy of a sample of 38 post-starburst quasars
   (PSQs) at z similar to 0.3, 29 of which have morphological
   classifications based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging. These
   broad-lined active galactic nuclei (AGNs) possess the spectral
   signatures of massive intermediate-aged stellar populations, making them
   potentially useful for studying connections between nuclear activity and
   host galaxy evolution. We model the spectra in order to determine the
   ages and masses of the host stellar populations, and the black hole
   masses and Eddington fractions of the AGNs. Our model components include
   an instantaneous starburst, a power law, and emission lines. We find
   that the PSQs have M-BH similar to 10(8) M-circle dot accreting at a few
   percent of Eddington luminosity and host similar to 10(10.5) M-circle
   dot stellar populations which are several hundred Myr to a few Gyr old.
   We investigate relationships among these derived properties, spectral
   properties, and morphologies. We find that PSQs hosted in spiral
   galaxies have significantly weaker AGN luminosities, older starburst
   ages, and narrow emission-line ratios diagnostic of ongoing star
   formation when compared to their early-type counterparts. We conclude
   that the early-type PSQs are likely the result of major mergers and were
   likely luminous infrared galaxies in the past, while spiral PSQs with
   more complex star formation histories are triggered by less dramatic
   events (e.g., harassment, bars). We provide diagnostics to distinguish
   the early-type and spiral hosts when high spatial resolution imaging is
   not available.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoresistive carbon nanotube (CNT) composites can radically enhance

   developing an analytical piezoresistivity model for CNT composites that

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of the friction stir welding of dissimilar metal
   joints is a daunting task given the complex issues involved such as the
   flow mixing action and the phase transformations. In this work, a 3D
   thermo-mechanical FE model is developed to simulate the dissimilar
   friction stir welding (DFSW) of aluminum-magnesium hi-metallic joints.
   The model is built using a manufacturing-processing-specific FEM
   software package (DEFORM 3D). Suitable constitutive laws are implemented
   to describe flow stress for both welded constituents: Al and Mg. The
   flow patterns of the stirring action from the simulations were verified
   against flow patterns of steel shots reported from experiments published
   in the literature. Also, the simulated interface patterns were found to
   be in agreement with microscopic images of welded sections taken from
   reported experiments. Furthermore, simulated temperature profiles
   favorably compare with temperature measurements previously published in
   the literature. The numerical model output includes relevant results
   such as material flow and volume fractions throughout the joint but most
   importantly in the recrystallized stir zone.}},

   operation. This experimental investigation focuses on the effects of
   100\% indolene and 70\% indolene/30\% ethanol blends on the ignition and
   combustion properties during SA HCCI operation. The spark assist effects
   are compared to baseline HCCI operation for each blend by varying spark
   timing at different fuel/air equivalence ratios ranging from phi = 0.4 -
   0.5. High speed imaging is used to understand connections between spark
   initiated flame propagation and heat release rates. Ethanol generally
   improves engine performance with higher IMEPn and higher stability
   compared to 100\% indolene. SA advances phasing within a range of
   similar to 5 CAD at lower engine speeds (700 RPM) and similar to 11 CAD
   at higher engine speeds (1200 RPM). SA does not affect heat release
   rates until immediately (within similar to 5 CAD) prior to autoignition.
   Unlike previous SA HCCI studies of indolene fuel in the same engine,

Abstract = {{Spark Assisted Compression Ignition (SACI) is a combustion mode that may
   offer significant efficiency improvements compared to conventional
   spark-ignited combustion systems. Unfortunately, SACI is constrained to
   a relatively narrow range of dilution levels and top dead center
   temperatures. Both positive valve overlap (PVO) and negative valve
   overlap (NVO) strategies may be utilized to attain these conditions at
   low and intermediate engine loads.
   The current work compares 1D thermodynamic simulations of PVO valving
   strategies and a baseline NVO strategy in a downsized boosted automotive
   engine with variable valve timing capability. As future downsized
   boosted engines may employ multiple combustion modes, the goal of this
   work is the definition of valving strategies appropriate for SACI
   combustion at low to moderate loads and SI combustion at moderate to
   high loads for an engine with fixed camshaft profiles. PVO durations,
   valve opening timings and peak lifts are investigated at low to moderate
   loads and are compared to a baseline NVO configuration in order to
   assess valving strategies appropriate for multi-mode combustion
   operation. A valvetrain kinematic model is used to translate the desired
   valve lift profiles into camshaft profiles, while a kinematic analysis
   is used to calculate piston to valve clearances and to define the
   practical limits of the PVO strategies. The NVO and PVO strategies are
   also compared to throttled SI operation at part load to assess the
   overall efficiency benefit of operating under the thermodynamic
   conditions of the SACI combustion regime.
   While the results of this study are engine specific, there are several
   camshaft profiles that are appropriate for the use of PVO rebreathing
   type valve events. For the range of PVO valve events examined and taking
   into consideration piston to valve interference, the use of high exhaust
   and low intake lifts with early exhaust valve opening timing and long
   PVO durations enables high levels of internal EGR with relatively low
   pinnping losses.}},

Abstract = {{A control-oriented model and its associated tuning methodology is
   presented for the air path of a six cylinder 13 L diesel engine equipped
   with an asymmetric twin-scroll turbine, wastegate (WG), and exhaust gas
   recirculation (EGR). This model is validated against experimental engine
   data and shows good agreement. The small scroll of the asymmetric twin
   scroll turbine is fed by the exhaust of three cylinders via a split
   manifold that operates at higher pressure than the exhaust manifold
   feeding the larger turbine scroll. The asymmetric design with the high
   exhaust back pressure on three of the six cylinders gives the necessary
   EGR capability, with reduced pumping work, but leads to complex flow
   characteristics. The mean-value model describes the flows through the
   engine, the flow through the two turbine scrolls, the EGR flow, and the
   WG flow as they are defined, and defines the pressure of the manifolds
   they connect to. Using seven states that capture the dynamics of the
   pressure and composition in the manifolds and the speed of the turbo
   shaft, the model can be used for transient control, along with set point
   optimization for the EGR and WG flows for each speed and load condition.
   The relatively low order of the model makes it amenable to fast
   simulations, system analysis, and control design.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments under two intake air swirl levels (swirl ratio of 0.55 and
   5.68) were conducted to investigate the early flame development of
   combustion in a single-cylinder spark-ignition direct-injection engine.
   The engine was equipped with a quartz insert in the piston which
   provided an optical access to its cylinder through the piston. The crank
   angle resolved combustion images through the piston window and
   in-cylinder pressure measurements of 250 cycles were recorded
   simultaneously for both swirl levels at a specified engine speed and low
   load condition. The early development, size and spatial characteristics
   extracted from the flame images were analyzed as a function of crank
   angle degrees after the ignition. Experimental results revealed that the
   early flame development was strongly influenced by the highly directed
   swirl motion of intake-air into the combustion cylinder. The location of
   the start of flame kernel relative to the spark plug position also
   changed intermittently at different swirl levels. While the structure of
   the early flame was found to be similar for both swirl levels, the
   starting location of the flame showed vast difference in how the flame
   progressed. In general, the flame kernel was formed 2 crank-angle
   degrees after spark timing for the high swirl level, which was 4
   crank-angle degrees earlier than that of low swirl case. For low swirl
   flow, the early combustion showed more cycle-to-cycle variation in terms
   of both flame size and centroid location. It was quantitatively shown
   that increasing swirl ratio from 0.55 to 5.68 could reduce the
   cycle-to-cycle variation of early flame structure, resulting in about 3
   to 4 crank-angle degrees advance of peak pressure location and 1\%
   improvement for COV of IMEP.}},

Abstract = {{As future downsized boosted engines may employ multiple combustion
   modes, the goal of the current work is the definition of valving
   strategies appropriate for moderate to high load spark ignition (SI)
   combustion and for spark assisted compression ignition (SACI) combustion
   at low to moderate loads for an engine with variable valve timing
   capability and fixed camshaft profiles. The dilution and unburned gas
   temperature requirements for SACI combustion can be markedly different
   from those of SI; therefore it is important to ensure that a given
   valving strategy is appropriate for operation within both regimes. This
   paper compares one dimensional (1D) thermodynamic simulations of rated
   engine operation with positive valve overlap (PVO) and a baseline
   negative valve overlap (NVO) camshaft design in a boosted automotive
   engine with variable valve timing capability. Several peak lifts and
   valve open durations are investigated to guide the down-selection of
   camshaft profiles for further evaluation under SACI conditions in a
   companion paper.
   While the results of this study are engine specific, rated performance
   predictions show that the duration of both the intake and exhaust
   camshafts significantly impacts the ability to achieve high load
   operation. While it was noted that the flow through the exhaust valve
   chokes for the majority of the exhaust stroke for peak exhaust lifts
   less than 8 mm, the engine rating could be achieved with peak intake
   lifts as low as 4 mm. Therefore, camshafts with peak lifts of 8/4 mm
   exhaust/intake were down selected to facilitate multimode combustion
   operation with high levels of PVO. Analysis of high load operation with
   the down-selected camshafts indicates that peak unburned gas
   temperatures remain low enough to mitigate end-gas knock, while other
   variables such as peak cylinder pressure, turbine inlet temperature and
   turbocharger speed are all predicted to be within acceptable limits.}},

Abstract = {{Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is a low temperature
   combustion strategy that simultaneously improves fuel efficiency and
   lowers engine-out NO emissions. Unfortunately, broad usage of HCCI is
   hampered by combustion instabilities and a limited operation envelope.
   To help understand these limitations, this paper teats individual
   cylinders in a production four-cylinder engine as dynamical systems that
   iterate CA90 (the crank angle where 90\% of net heat release is
   achieved) cycle-to-cycle as the engine operates in an unboosted,
   negative valve overlap HCCI combustion mode. This approach is shown to
   provide qualitative understanding of the stability limit bifurcation
   behavior, while also enabling quantitative cycle-to-cycle predictions of
   combustion phasing across a wide variety of transient and steady-state
   conditions, right up to complete misfire.}},

Abstract = {{Bioreactor landfills enhance biodegradation of municipal solid waste
   (MSW) via active liquid addition and/or leachate recirculation. This
   study presents a landfill simulator laboratory experimental setup that
   was used to study biodegradation of MSW and to collect data to
   characterize physical, geotechnical, chemical, and microbial changes in
   the MSW specimen. The simulator hada diameter of 0.3m and a volume of 40
   L and was filled with 30 kg of well-characterized MSW obtained from a
   landfill. Leachate was recirculated and MSW biodegradation was monitored
   for 250 days. The total volume of the specimen (V-t) reduced 13\%,
   whereas the total unit weight increased steadily with time after an
   initial adjustment period. The long-term compression ratio (C-LT)
   changed over time with a maximum value of 0.125. Biogas consisted of
   approximately 55\% CH4 and 45\% CO2. A total of 425 L CH4 was generated
   and the peak CH4 generation rate (r(CH4)) was 10.3 L/day. Maximum
   concentrations of soluble and insoluble COD (chemical oxygen demand,
   sCOD and insCOD) in the leachate were 4,190 mg O-2/L and 990 mg O-2/L,
   respectively. The concentration of microorganisms in the leachate was
   estimated by measuring the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) concentration and
   the maximum observed value was 8,610 ng DNA/ml. The DNA concentration in
   the leachate was indicative of r(CH4) and the change rate of soluble COD
   (r(sCOD)). They were related to the cumulative volume of CH4 (Sigma
   V-CH4) and C-LT. The experimental setup and the data collected may
   provide a valuable basis for future studies of coupled phenomena
   relevant to the degradation of MSW.}},

   sub-cells employing solution and vapor deposited donors and a fullerene
   acceptor. One sub-cell that absorbs primarily from the green into the

   blended sguaraine/C-70 bilayer heterojunction, while the second, visible
   absorbing sub-cell consists of a vapor-deposited
   tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP):C-70 planar-mixed heterojunction.
   The resulting stacked tandem device harvests photons of lambda < 800 nm

Abstract = {{This paper describes simple and suitable for real-time implementation
   algorithms for on-board learning of Markov Chain models of driving
   conditions (e. g., driver wheel torque request, vehicle speed,
   surrounding traffic speed, road grade, road curvature etc.). The use of
   Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence is proposed as a stopping and
   re-initialization criterion for learning, permitting an evolving set of
   Markov Chain models to be generated for different route segments.
   Examples based on learning models of road grade and vehicle speed are
   reported. Assuming that a set of learned Markov Chain models and of
   associated control policies is available on-board of the vehicle, the
   use of KL divergence is also advocated for selecting the control policy
   that matches the current driving conditions. Potential applications of
   this approach include optimal energy management in Hybrid Electric
   Vehicles (HEV) and fuel efficient Adaptive Cruise Control.}},

   machines, we show under more realistic assumptions, important tasks are
   decidable instead of undecidable. Specifically, we show that detecting
   traditional malware unpacking behavior - in which a payload is
   decompressed or decrypted and subsequently executed - is decidable under
   our assumptions. We then examine the issue of dealing with complex but
   decidable problems. We look for lessons from the hardware verification

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a technique for estimating the input
   nonlinearity of a Hammerstein system by using multiple orthogonal ersatz
   nonlinearities. Theoretical analysis shows that by replacing the unknown
   input nonlinearity by an ersatz nonlinearity, the estimates of the
   Markov parameters of the plant are correct up to a scalar factor, which
   is related to the inner product of the true input nonlinearity and the
   ersatz nonlinearity. These coefficients are used to construct and
   estimate the true nonlinearity represented as an orthogonal basis
   expansion. We demonstrate this technique by using a Fourier series
   expansion as well as orthogonal polynomials. We show that the kernel of
   the inner product associated with the orthogonal basis functions must be
   chosen to be the density function of the input signal.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison of serial, parallel, and dual Passive Assist Devices (PADs)

   safety. In previous work we demonstrated this concept experimentally on
   a single link robot arm augmented with a torsional spring in parallel.
   Here we show that the concept can extended to serial and dual systems as
   well. To make the optimization converge more quickly we introduce a new
   initial design using a weighted force displacement curve fit. We provide
   engineering insight into why different types of PADs perform differently
   depending on the maneuver and offer guidelines on how to select a
   specific type based on the application. Finally, we demonstrate this
   design process and selection procedure on a 3-link manipulator arm and
   show that a combination of parallel and dual PADs could reduce energy
   consumption by up to 78\%.}},

   of mechanical tilting angles in both theta(x),and theta(y) directions in
   a footprint of 3.2x3.2 mm. The experimental static displacements and
   transient response of the actuator were used to identify residual
   stresses in the thin films, dimensional variance due to fabrication
   limitation, and damping coefficients in the model. With the identified
   parameters, the model predicts the static displacements of the four
   corners of the stage with an average absolute error of 17.4 pm over five
   different voltage levels and shows a reasonable agreement with the
   experimentally measured transient dynamic data. These results will be

   with a piezoelectric micro-actuator is presented in this paper. An
   asynchronous threshold sensor is hypothesized as a way to improve state
   estimates obtained from analog sensor measurements of micro-actuator
   motion. In order to produce accurate periodic signals using the proposed
   piezoelectric actuator and sensing arrangement, an Iterative Learning
   Control (ILC) is employed for control system design. Three sensing
   strategies: (i) an analog sensor alone with a Kalman filter, (ii) an
   analog sensor and threshold sensor with a Kalman filter and (iii) an
   analog sensor and threshold sensor with a Kalman smoother are compared
   in simulation. Results show that incorporating threshold sensors into
   the piezoelectric micro-actuation system should allow at least certain
   angular positions or rates to be known with much higher accuracy than
   from analog sensing alone, which can be useful for identifying
   calibration curves from the linear region of IMU operation.}},

Abstract = {{The paper treats a class of parameter-dependent optimization/root
   finding problems where the minimizer or a real root need to be
   determined as a function of parameter. Applications of
   parameter-dependent optimization include spacecraft debris avoidance,
   adaptive control of Hybrid Elecfric Vehicles, engine mapping and model
   predictive control. In these and other problems, the parameter changes
   can be controlled either directly or indirectly In this paper, the error
   analysis of a dynamic predictor-corrector Newton's type algorithm is
   presented. Based on this analysis, an approach to govern the changes in
   the parameter to enable the algorithm to track the minimizer within an
   acceptable error bound is described. Two simulation examples are
   presented. In the first example the objective is to minimize the
   distance between points on a curve and a given set and simultaneously
   move as fast as possible along the given curve. In the second example we
   illustrate the use of this technique for aircraft flight envelope
   estimation. Specifically, we estimate maximum speed of an aircraft as a
   function of its altitude and flight path angle.}},

Abstract = {{Surveillance missions that involve unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs)
   include situations where a UGV has to choose between alternative paths
   to complete its mission. Currently, UGV missions are often limited by
   the available on-board energy. Thus, we propose a dynamic most
   energy-efficient path planning algorithm that integrates mission prior
   knowledge with real-time sensory information to identify the mission's
   most energy-efficient path. Our proposed approach predicts and updates
   the distribution of energy requirement of alternative paths using
   recursive Bayesian estimation through two stages: (1) exploration - road
   segments are explored to reduce their energy prediction uncertainty; (2)
   exploitation - the most energy-efficient path is selected using the
   collected information in the exploration stage and is traversed. Our
   simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms offline
   methods, as well as a method that only relies on exploitation to
   identify the most energy-efficient path.}},

Abstract = {{Health management of Li-ion batteries requires knowledge of certain
   battery internal dynamics (e.g., lithium consumption and film growth at
   the solid-electrolyte interface) whose inputs and outputs are not
   directly measurable with noninvasive methods. Therefore, identification
   of those dynamics can be classified as an inaccessible subsystem
   identification problem. To address this problem, the retrospective-cost
   subsystem identification (RCSI) method is adopted in this paper
   Specifically, a simulation-based study is presented that represents the
   battery using an electrochemistry-based battery charge/discharge model
   of Doyle, Fuller, and Newman augmented with a battery-health model by
   Ramadass. The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film growth portion of
   the battery-health model is defined as the inaccessible subsystem to be
   identified using RCSI. First, it is verified that RCSI with a
   first-order subsystem structure can accurately estimate the film growth
   when noise or modeling errors are ignored. Parameter convergence issues
   are highlighted. Second, allowable input and output noise levels for
   desirable film growth tracking performance are determined by studying
   the relationship between voltage change and film growth in the truth
   model. The performance of RCSI with measurement noise is illustrated.
   The results show that RCSI can identify the film growth within 1.5\%
   when the output measurement noise level is comparable to the change in
   output voltage between successive cycles due to film growth, or when the
   input measurement noise is comparable to the difference in current that
   results in a difference in voltage that is the same as the voltage
   change between successive cycles. Finally, the sensitivity of the
   performance of RSCI to initial condition errors in the battery
   charge/discharge model is investigated. The results show that when the
   initial conditions have an error of 1\%, the identified results change
   by 7\%. These results will help with selecting the appropriate sensors
   for the experiments with the hardware.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to follow or move alongside a person is a necessary skill
   for an autonomous mobile agent that works with human users. To
   accomplish the task, the robot must be able to track and follow the
   person it is accompanying while maneuvering through obstacles without
   collision. Also, the robot must be able to respect user preferences and
   exhibit behaviors that are intuitive and socially acceptable. That is,
   the robot is required to make complex decisions on-line, in environments
   that are almost always dynamic and uncertain in the presence of
   pedestrians.
   This paper discusses a versatile motion planning algorithm for person
   pacing, which refers to the capability to walk next to another person at
   user-preferred distance and orientation {[}1]. The algorithm is based on
   the Model Predictive Equilibrium Point Control (MPEPC) framework {[}2]
   which allows a robot to navigate gracefully in dynamic, uncertain, and
   structured environments.
   We show that with a simple task description for person pacing, an agent
   with the MPEPC navigation algorithm can make intelligent decisions
   on-line, maximizing the expected progress toward achieving the task
   while minimizing the action cost and the probability of collision. We
   present navigation examples generated from real data traces, where a
   wheelchair robot exhibits very reasonable behaviors across a wide range

   the presence of glass and other non-diffuse surfaces. This is a major
   problem for robot navigation in many indoor environments due to the
   prevalence of glass paned doors, windows, and even glass walls, as well

   occupancy grid mapping make the assumption that objects in the
   environment are detectable from all angles. However, glass and other
   specular surfaces are invisible to LIDAR at most angles and so become
   washed out as ``noise{''}. We modify the standard occupancy grid
   algorithm to allow for mapping objects that are only visible from
   certain view angles, by tracking the subset of angles from which objects
   are reliably visible. We show that these angles can be determined
   reliably with a single pass through the environment, and that the
   information can be used to map both diffuse and specular surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on an integrated navigation algorithm for the visual
   simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) robotic area coverage
   problem. In the robotic area coverage problem, the goal is to explore
   and map a given target area in a reasonable amount of time. This goal
   necessitates the use of minimally redundant overlap trajectories for
   coverage efficiency; however, visual SLAM's navigation estimate will
   inevitably drift over time in the absence of loop-closures. Therefore,
   efficient area coverage and good SLAM navigation performance represent
   competing objectives. To solve this decision-making problem, we
   introduce perception-driven navigation (PDN), an integrated navigation
   algorithm that automatically balances between exploration and
   revisitation using a reward framework. This framework accounts for
   vehicle localization uncertainty, area coverage performance, and the
   identification of good candidate regions in the environment for
   loop-closure. Results are shown for a hybrid simulation using synthetic
   and real imagery from an autonomous underwater ship hull inspection
   application.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on methods for incorporating camera calibration
   uncertainty into a two-view sparse bundle adjustment (SBA) framework.
   The co-registration of two images is useful in mobile robotics for
   determining motion over time. These camera measurements can constrain a
   robot's relative poses so that the trajectory and map can be estimated
   in a technique known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).
   Here, we comment on the importance of propagating uncertainty in both
   feature extraction and camera calibration in visual pose-graph SLAM. We
   derive an improved pose co-variance estimate that leverages the
   Unscented Transform, and compare its performance to previous methods in
   both simulated and experimental trials. The two experiments reported
   here involve data from a camera mounted on a KUKA robotic arm (where a
   precise ground-truth trajectory is available) and a Hovering Autonomous
   Underwater Vehicle (HAUV) for largescale autonomous ship hull

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a factor-based method for node marginalization in
   simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) pose-graphs. Node
   marginalization in a pose-graph induces fill-in and leads to

   able to produce a new set of constraints over the elimination clique
   that can represent either the true marginalization, or a sparse
   approximation of the true marginalization using a Chow-Liu tree. The
   proposed algorithm improves upon existing methods in two key ways:
   First, it is not limited to strictly full-state relative-pose
   constraints and works equally well with other low-rank constraints such
   as those produced by monocular vision. Second, the new factors are
   produced in a way that accounts for measurement correlation, a problem
   ignored in other methods that rely upon measurement composition. We
   evaluate the proposed method over several real-world SLAM graphs and
   show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of

Abstract = {{Partial least squares (PLS) regression combines dimensionality reduction
   and prediction using a latent variable model. It provides better
   predictive ability than principal component analysis by taking into
   account both the independent and response variables in the dimension
   reduction procedure. However, PLS suffers from over-fitting problems for
   few samples but many variables. We formulate a new criterion for sparse
   PLS by adding a structured sparsity constraint to the global SIM-PLS
   optimization. The constraint is a sparsity-inducing norm, which is
   useful for selecting the important variables shared among all the
   components. The optimization is solved by an augmented Lagrangian method
   to obtain the PLS components and to perform variable selection
   simultaneously. We propose a novel greedy algorithm to overcome the
   computation difficulties. Experiments demonstrate that our approach to
   PLS regression attains better performance with fewer selected
   predictors.}},

Abstract = {{The minimum supply voltage (V-min) is explored for sequential logic
   circuits by statistically simulating the impact of within-die process
   variations and gate-dielectric soft breakdown on data retention and hold
   time. As supply voltage (V-cc) scales, statistical circuit simulations
   demonstrate that hold time increases faster than circuit delay or cycle
   time, consequently the required number of mindelay buffers increases.
   For this reason, a new hold-time violation metric defines V-min as the
   V-cc in which the hold time exceeds a target percentage of the cycle
   time. Simulation results in a 22nm tri-gate CMOS technology indicate a
   data-retention V-min of 0.61V(norm) and a hold-time V-min of
   0.73V(norm), where V-norm represents a normalized voltage for the
   process technology node. A key insight reveals that upsizing the first
   clock inverter in the sequential circuit reduces the hold-time V-min by
   18\% and the overall V-min by 16\%.}},

Abstract = {{Co-simulating distributed hardware-in-the-loop systems in real time over
   the Internet entails communication delays that can lead to significant
   loss of fidelity and even instability in the system. To address this
   challenge, this paper proposes an observer based framework that, unlike
   previously reported efforts, does not require the observer to know and
   model the observed system dynamics. This is achieved by deriving the
   closed-loop dynamics of the observer based on a sliding surface. Even
   though the resulting error system does not necessarily stay on a sliding
   surface, its asymptotic convergence to zero is still guaranteed. First,
   this idea is developed for a generic networked system simulation
   framework and its stability is established. Then, it is applied to a
   mass-spring-damper system to illustrate the mechanics of the approach on
   a simple, linear example and demonstrate that the approach can stabilize
   the system that is otherwise unstable due to delay. Finally, a
   vehicle-engine-driver system simulation is considered to evaluate the
   performance of the approach on a more realistic, nonlinear example. An
   improvement of up to 33\% is observed in the fidelity of the simulation.
   The conclusion is that the approach holds a significant potential to
   alleviate the negative impact of delay and improve the stability and
   fidelity of networked system simulations. Its benefits become more
   pronounced as the delay increases.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, discrete-event process simulation was first and most
   widely used in manufacturing contexts. As the technology has gradually
   matured and knowledge of its benefits has become more widely known,
   simulation usage has spread to warehouse design and operation,
   health-care delivery, retail customer service, and (as in this paper),
   the transport of people and/or goods.
   This project simulated the Blue Bus system of the University of
   Michigan. We analyzed the waiting time of passengers at each stop and
   the utilization of buses under two strategies; one is based on the
   schedule, the other is adding eight buses of Bursley-Baits during peak
   time besides the scheduled shifts which is practical Blue Bus running
   strategy. Under the two strategies, we analyzed the different scenarios
   that number of passengers increases by some times. We compared these
   scenarios and found the practical strategy is more robust when there is
   a sharp increase of passengers.}},

Abstract = {{A piezoelectric cantilever array was fabricated, for use as a cochlear
   implant. An array of 4.2 mu m thick aluminum nitride (AlN) bimorph
   cantilevers, laminated with platinum and mounted on a silicon backbone,
   are designed to transduce incident sound pressure waves into electrical
   current when submerged in ionic cochlear fluid. The ability to prescribe
   the desired geometry and to deposit high quality piezoelectric films are
   two key aspects crucial to the success of this design concept. A 3cm
   parylene - gold - parylene ribbon cable extends from the probe to an
   electrode bay, for external measurements of the transducer array
   response. The AIN film is measured to have a rocking curve of 0.94
   degrees full width half maximum (FWHM), a d(31) of 2.1 pm/V, and a
   dissipation factor of 0.002. The actuated response of a single
   cantilever element in air shows good agreement with model predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy controls cavitating bubble clouds to fractionate tissue
   using high pressure ultrasound pulses. Over the histotripsy treatment,
   the tissue is increasingly fractionated and eventually liquefied. This
   process can be monitored in real time using color Doppler synchronized
   with histotripsy pulses, but the mechanism is not fully understood. We
   hypothesize that there are two motion phases after each histotripsy
   pulse: 1) chaotic motion due to cavitation followed by 2) coherent
   motion induced by acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) from the
   histotripsy pulse. By delaying the Doppler acquisition after the chaotic
   motion phase, color Doppler can be used to detect the ARFI-induced
   motion in the treatment tissue, providing real-time feedback for
   histotripsy tissue fractionation. The residual nuclei from cavitation
   can persist after the collapse to provide strong acoustic scatterers for
   Doppler. An agarose tissue phantom was treated with 2-cycle pulses at >
   30 MPa using a 500 kHz phased array transducer. Ultrasound acquisitions
   and high-speed optical images were acquired for 19 ms after every 10th
   therapy pulse to estimate the motion of the residual cavitation nuclei
   (the only scatterers in the phantom). PIV and Doppler results showed a
   brief period of chaotic motion (0.5-2.0 ms depending on the
   fractionation level) followed by coherent motion first moving away from
   the transducer (3-6 ms) and then rebounding back (up to 19 ms). Over the
   course of the treatment in both phantom and ex vivo porcine liver, the
   duration of the push and rebound increased with increasing number of
   therapy pulses, and eventually peaked. Using an appropriate delay
   between the Doppler and the histotripsy pulse to monitor the ARFI
   motion, the Doppler velocity increased with the number of therapy pulses
   and peaked, likely when the tissue was liquefied. The results support
   our hypothesis that appropriately timed color Doppler can measure the
   coherent ARFI-induced motion in the tissue treated with histotripsy
   without cavitation inference, providing real-time therapy feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular access (VA) surveillance to guide care is essential for
   dialysis patients. Non-linear, patient specific formation of stenoses
   reduce VA efficiency. Various methods are used to monitor blood flow or
   pressure. However, these are surrogates for stenosis rather than direct
   measurements. There is also no reimbursement for VA surveillance and
   measurements consume clinician time, making more frequent measurements
   difficult. Hemodynamic variability increases the chance of infrequent
   observations missing stenosis formation.
   This paper presents a specialized ultrasound system intended to slide
   between the dialysis needles and provide operator independent VA
   geometry and volume flow during treatment. Specific attention is paid
   toward the magnetic design of the Lorentz force linear actuator.
   Experimental results indicate that the system can successfully collect
   Doppler flow information across a tissue-mimicking flow phantom vessel.}},

Abstract = {{Residual microscopic bubble nuclei can persist on the order of 1 second
   following a cavitation event. These bubbles may limit the efficiency of
   ultrasound therapies such as shock wave lithotripsy and histotripsy, as
   they attenuate pulses that arrive subsequent to their formation and seed
   cavitation memory. Here, we explore a strategy for the removal of
   residual bubble nuclei following a cavitation event, using a low
   amplitude ultrasound burst to stimulate bubble coalescence. All
   experiments were conducted in degassed water and monitored using high
   speed photography. The following general pulse scheme was used: (A)
   Cavitation Initiation Pulse: A cavitational bubble cloud was initiated
   by a 1 MHz therapy transducer using a very short intense pulse (P- > 30
   MPa); (B) Nuclei Removal Pulse: Residual bubble nuclei were sonicated
   using a 2 ms pulse from a separate 350 kHz unfocused transducer to
   stimulate coalescence. Nuclei removal pulses with amplitudes ranging
   from 0 to 750 kPa were tested; (C) Interrogation Pulse: The presence of
   residual nuclei following the removal pulse was probed using a second
   lower amplitude pulse from the therapy transducer sufficient to cause
   residual microscopic nuclei to expand and be more easily detected via
   high speed imaging. The backlit area of shadow from expanded bubbles was
   calculated to quantify the efficacy of nuclei removal. It was found that
   the control case (nuclei removal pulse amplitude = 0) generated a bubble
   shadow area of 0.64 +/- 0.08 mm(2). For nuclei removal pulse amplitudes
   of 50 to 150 kPa, minimal coalescence was observed in high speed video,
   and the area of bubbles excited by the interrogation pulse did not
   differ significantly from control (p> 0.08). Pronounced bubble
   coalescence was observable for nuclei removal pulses >= 250 kPa, with
   the extent of coalescence increasing with pulse amplitude. Bubble shadow
   area was significantly reduced relative to control in these cases (p <=
   0.02). We hypothesize that the primary and secondary Bjerknes forces act
   in concert to produce the bubble coalescence observed in this study.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous in vitro investigation, it was shown that histotripsy
   therapy can generate precise lesions through rib obstacles without
   aberration correction as long as the focal pressure amplitude is
   modulated to exclusively allow the main focal beam to exceed the bubble
   cloud initiation threshold. This study investigates the therapeutic
   capabilities of transcostal histotripsy ablation and its thermal impact
   on overlying tissues in vivo without using aberration correction
   methods. Treatments were conducted in 8 pigs, with 4 lesions generated
   through transcostal windows with full ribcage obstruction and 4 lesions
   created through transabdominal windows without rib coverage. A 750 kHz
   focused transducer was used to sonicate the targets using 5 cycle pulses
   at a repetition frequency of 200 Hz. Estimated in situ peak negative
   pressures of 13-17 MPa were generated at the focus. Each treatment
   lasted approximately 40 minutes to allow temperature measurements to
   saturate. Temperatures on overlying tissues including ribs were measured
   with needle thermocouples. Lesions were created by mechanically scanning
   the transducer focus, yielding comparable ablation volumes of 3.6 +/-
   1.7 cm(3) and 4.5 +/- 2.0 cm(3) in transcostal and transabdominal
   treatments, respectively. The average temperature increase on the ribs
   in all transcostal treatments was 3.9 +/- 2.1 degrees C, while in
   transabdominal treatments an increase of 1.7 +/- 1.3 degrees C was
   observed. The results suggest that histotripsy therapy can deliver
   effective and safe treatment through the ribcage without requiring
   aberration correction or rib sparing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound transducer arrays represent the current standard for medical
   ultrasound imaging applications. Despite this, the development of
   low-cost imaging systems is typically limited to single element wobbler
   transducers. We have developed a novel single element transducer system
   that is able to replicate the function of expensive linear arrays. This
   system uses a Lorentz force linear motor to mechanically sweep a single
   element transducer along a linear path. In order to optimize our
   system's operating characteristics for high speed imaging applications,
   we have performed a fluid dynamics analysis of the drag generated as a
   result of the transducer motion. Analytical and finite element models
   are derived for the motion of a rectangular cylinder through a confined
   channel. Our analysis reveals that small changes to the actuator housing
   geometry can drastically reduce drag, allowing us to achieve higher
   imaging frame rates. In addition, we predict the formation of an
   alternating vortex street that may introduce an additional source of
   vibration.}},

   coupled nonlinear governing equations for the electric field, the fluid
   flow field and free surface deformation. The effect of mesh size and
   interfacial thickness on numerical accuracy and stability of the phase
   field modeling is studied. The phase field model is validated with the
   Taylor theory for the deformation of a single dielectric droplet in
   electric fields. Computed results show that the deformation of a leaky
   dielectric droplet undergoes various different deformation stages before
   reaching the equilibrium oblate shape, which is caused by the free
   charge relaxation near the fluid-fluid interface. Also, the deformation
   and rising speed of the bubble are affected by the applied electric
   field in both magnitude and direction. For a rising bubble in a
   horizontal electric field, it rises slowly as a result of a larger drag
   caused by electric-stretching along the horizontal electric field. In
   comparison with the vertical field, the indentation on the bubble base
   starts earlier but grows more slowly after an initial period. The bubble
   deformation and fluid flow structure in a horizontal field are three
   dimensional.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the effect of two crucial processing parameters
   (seed size and amount of ion solution) on the controlled seed-and-grow
   preparation of polystyrene@gold/silver nanoshells with chitosan (CHI) as
   a surface modifier. Experiments involved synthesizing PS nanospheres and
   functionalizing them with CHI. Au seeds were then attached onto the
   CHI-functionalized PS spheres and metal was subsequently deposited onto
   the PS spheres from metal ion solutions to form PS@metal nanoshells. It
   is found that Au seed size can have a profound effect on the seed
   coverage of PS surface and the quality (morphology and optical
   properties) of nanoshells. Use of smaller-sized seed sizes gives a
   better seed coverage and good quality nanoshells. Appropriate volumetric
   amount of K-gold/silver nitrate solution is required for obtaining a
   complete nanshell with desired shell thickness. These findings are
   confirmed by the TEM characterization and the UV-vis spectra of light
   absorption.}},

   an active system using energy minimization based on a known maneuver is

   concept experimentally on a single link robot arm augmented with a
   torsional spring. Here we show that the concept can effectively be
   applied to more complicated machines performing known periodic motions
   by simulating a 3-link manipulator arm. The arm can be decoupled prior
   to optimization using inverse dynamics-greatly simplifying the
   optimization problem. The addition of optimized springs results in a
   system-wide decrease in energy consumption of 70.9\%. Finally, we
   consider a distribution of possible maneuvers and use the concepts of
   robust design to find springs that increase the guaranteed energy
   savings at a 90\% confidence level.}},

Abstract = {{The attitude dynamics of a spacecraft with a variable speed control
   moment gyroscope (VSCMG), in the presence of external torques and
   internal inputs, is derived using variational principles. A complete
   dynamics model, that relaxes some of the assumptions made in prior
   literature on control moment gyroscopes, is obtained. A non-standard
   VSCMG model, that has an offset between the center of the gimbal axis
   and the center of the rotor (flywheel) is considered. The dynamics
   equations show the complex nonlinear coupling between the internal
   degrees of freedom associated with the VSCMG and the spacecraft base
   body's attitude degrees of freedom. Some of this coupling is induced by
   the non-zero offset between the gimbal axis and the rotor center. This
   dynamics model is then generalized to include the effects of multiple
   control moment gyroscopes placed in the base body with non-parallel
   gimbal axes. It is shown that the dynamical coupling can improve the
   control authority on the angular momentum of the base body of the
   spacecraft using changes in the momentum variables of the VSCMG.
   Numerical simulations confirm the use of these VSCMGs for attitude
   control for a given de-tumbling maneuver.}},

Abstract = {{Open-Circuit-Voltage (OCV) is an essential part of battery models for
   state-of-charge (SOC) estimation. In this paper, we propose a new
   parametric OCV model, which considers the staging phenomenon during the
   lithium intercalation/deintercalation process. Results show that the new
   parametric model improves SOC estimation accuracy compared to other
   existing OCV models. Moreover, the model is shown to be suitable and
   effective for battery state-of-health monitoring. In particular, the new
   OCV model can be used for incremental capacity analysis (ICA), which
   reveals important information on the cell behavior associated with its
   electrochemical properties and aging status.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs, or crash dummies)
   used in the assessment of vehicle crash protection were created based on
   particular anthropometric targets. The Hybrid-III ATDs widely used in
   the U. S. are commonly called the ``5th-percentile female{''},
   ``50th-percentile male{''}, and ``95th-percentile male{''} ATDs,
   referring to selection of the respective percentiles of the male and
   female U.S. adult populations as design targets for the ATDs. The
   objective of this work was to assess whether secular trends in U. S.
   anthropometry have affected the relationship between the ATDs and the
   population.
   Method: The corresponding percentiles were calculated from data obtained
   in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the
   years 2005-2008.
   Results: The results showed that the ATD stature targets differ from the
   current population by less than 5 percentile points, but the
   discrepancies for mass are much larger for the two male ATDs.
   Conclusions: The reference mass for the midsize-male Hybrid-III ATD of
   78.2 kg is now the 33rd percentile body mass for U. S. adults, and the
   large-male ATD reference body mass of 102.5 kg is now the 81st
   percentile. The implications of these differences are discussed in the
   context of restraint system design.}},

Abstract = {{To enable real-time systems to adapt to dynamically changing
   environments, update functionalities and/or accommodate those tasks
   migrated from other failed sub-systems, there have been a number of
   studies on making timing guarantees while accounting for change of
   parameters and addition/deletion of tasks. While most of them have dealt
   with ``transition{''} protocols that delay next task releases or discard
   the unfinished tasks released before the transition, such protocols are
   not suitable for many control systems in which missing/delaying control
   updates (by completing periodic tasks) even during a transition or
   mode-change may cause system instability or incur a significant
   incremental operational cost. In this paper, we focus on a transition
   protocol that does not miss/delay control updates during a system
   transition, and develop a new schedulability analysis for the transition
   in a real-time multi-core system, which provides sufficient timing
   guarantees without requiring any online information, such as the release
   and execution patterns of tasks and the start time of a transition. To
   achieve this, we extend an existing popular schedulability analysis
   framework for non-transitional tasks, and identify the scenarios that
   maximize the duration of a task's interference to another task in the
   case of a transition. Since the analysis works for any arbitrary
   transition order of tasks, we can improve the schedulability performance
   by enforcing a specific order. We formulate the problem of assigning an
   optimal transition order, and develop a solution by deriving some
   properties of optimality. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the
   proposed solution finds more schedulable task sets, which are not
   covered by naive approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Satellites are indispensable for broadcast, weather forecast,
   navigation, and many other applications, but their design entails a
   number of stringent requirements, such as limited space and weight,
   impossible/costly online repairs, severe radiation, and a wide range of
   temperature they have to withstand. These requirements can only be met
   by an effective, robust co-design of physical and computing (control)
   parts of each satellite, making them prototypical cyber-physical systems
   (CPSes). Of the various CPS issues related to satellites, this paper
   focuses on offline design and online management of satellite power
   systems. Specifically, we analyze and model unique characteristics of
   power supply and demand of a satellite, which are dictated by the
   periodicity of power generation from solar panels and the nonlinear
   behavior of rechargeable battery cells. Based on the understanding of
   these characteristics, we first propose how to find the best
   configuration (e. g., the number, the arrangement, and the type) of
   solar panels and battery cells at design time, such that all tasks can
   be executed without power shortage throughout the satellite's mission
   lifetime. Second, we propose how to manage power online so as to execute
   the highest QoS versions of tasks (thus yielding the most
   power-effective performance) without compromising the power-sufficiency
   guarantee under a given configuration. As a case study, we study
   cubic-shaped nano-satellites, which have been launched multiple times
   since 2004. We borrow their architecture, configuration and parameters,
   and demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and management of
   satellite power systems.}},

Abstract = {{The power link budget for a system that transmits and receives
   propagating Bessel beams is studied. The transmitter and receiver are
   separated by a distance D and consist of leaky radial waveguides.
   Full-wave simulations are used to compute the admittance-matrix
   representation of the system. The resonances of the coupled transmitter
   and receiver are then derived using classical network theory. For
   comparison purposes, a second configuration with its transmitter and
   receiver connected by a circular waveguide is considered. In contrast to
   the open system, such a configuration is closed and does not radiate. It
   is found that within the non-diffractive range of the Bessel beam, both
   closed and open systems exhibit the same resonances within an error of
   0.6\%. Calculations show that the power efficiency of the open system
   can exceed 85\% within the non-diffractive range. The proposed system
   may find application in areas such as wireless power transfer,
   near-field communication and non-destructive evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel photoconductive antenna which utilizes nanoscale
   plasmonic electrodes to significantly enhance the efficiency and
   terahertz radiation power of conventional photoconductive antennas. The
   terahertz radiation power enhancement results from a significant
   reduction in the average transport path of photocarriers to reach the
   device contact electrodes. Thus, the photocurrent levels feeding the
   terahertz antenna in a sub-picosecond timescale are considerably
   increased, resulting in significantly higher terahertz radiation power
   levels. By incorporating the nanoscale plasmonic electrodes into a
   photoconductive antenna, we experimentally demonstrate up to 50 times
   higher efficiencies and terahertz radiation powers, compared to a
   similar conventional photoconductive antenna without the plasmonic
   electrodes.}},

   closer to that of a high junction capacitance and thus the solar cell
   works as a short circuit with a small phase shift at high frequencies.

Abstract = {{Technology scaling continues to improve density, but also reduces the
   critical charge to hold a logic state, causing devices to become more
   susceptible to accidental disruptions due to noise and soft errors.
   Increased process variation adds to the reliability challenge, resulting
   in over designs and extra timing margins at the cost of power
   consumption, silicon area and performance degradation. We present
   efficient in situ error detection techniques to exploit datapath
   characteristics for monitoring circuit errors: pre-edge checking in
   non-critical paths without hold time constraints; post-edge checking in
   critical paths without sacrificing performance; and cross-edge checking
   in moderate paths for the optimal trade-off. The techniques are all
   realized using the inherent redundancy within a conventional flip-flop
   design and do not require any logic or sample duplication as done by
   most existing methods. The detection-enabled flip-flop is implemented
   using only 31 transistors as a competitive and low-cost solution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents our research in text mining for discovering
   important engineering fault diagnostic knowledge from unstructured and
   verbatim text descriptions. In particular we focus on developing machine
   learning algorithms for detecting documents that contain descriptions of
   systematic failures and root causes to the faults. We developed a
   machine algorithm based on entropy analysis to extract an A-word list, a
   list of words that are important to characterize the documents of
   interests, a vector space model to represent features of important
   documents, and a constraint based k-means clustering algorithm to
   generate high purity clusters for use in detecting important documents.
   We applied the algorithms to automotive diagnostic text data, which are
   unstructured and verbatim descriptions by customers and technicians that
   contain many typos and self-invented terms. We were able to reduce a
   list of 2183 words to a list of 137 important words. The classification
   system generated by these machine learning algorithms showed high recall
   and accuracy in detecting important diagnostic descriptions.}},

Abstract = {{The trend towards multi-core/many-core architectures is well underway.
   It is therefore becoming very important to develop software in ways that
   take advantage of such parallel architectures. This particularly entails
   a shift in programming paradigms towards fine-grained, thread-parallel
   computing. Many parallel programming models have been introduced
   targeting such intra-task thread-level parallelism. However, most
   successful results on traditional multi-core real-time scheduling are
   focused on sequential programming models. For example, thread-level
   parallelism is not properly captured into the concept of interference,
   which is key to many schedulability analysis techniques. Thereby, most
   interference-based analysis techniques are not directly applicable to
   parallel programming models. Motivated by this, we extend the notion of
   interference to capture thread-level parallelism more accurately. We
   then leverage the proposed notion of parallelism-aware interference to
   derive efficient EDF schedulability tests that are directly applicable
   to synchronous parallel task models on multi-core platforms. Our
   evaluation results indicate that the proposed analysis significantly
   advances the state-of-the-art in EDF schedulability analysis for
   synchronous parallel tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Although discrete-time chaotic-map TRNGs, in principle, are capable of
   generating unbiased and uncorrelated random bits, implementation
   variations deteriorate the quality of the output sequence as a result of
   variation of the chaotic map parameters (which result in a non-ideal
   map). In this paper, we introduce an analytical technique to investigate
   the impact of process variations on the randomness of the output
   sequence generated using tent map-based discrete-time chaotic map truly
   random number generators (TRNGs). We validate our results against the
   probability density function (pdf) estimated using extensive Monte-Carlo
   simulations applied to the non-ideal map characteristics. The simulation
   results suggest that the estimation of pdf using our simplified
   theoretical method is in good agreement with that of the Monte-Carlo
   simulations. Finally, the quality of the random bits have also been
   evaluated using the entropy measure.}},

   consumption by only operating in the desired bandwidth from the reserved
   bandwidth required for ADC's application. Our simulation results
   demonstrate that a relatively high SNR can be obtained using the
   designed Sigma Delta ADC. We provide an implementation of the designed
   ADC using Gm-C circuits with 0.18 mu m IBM CMOS technology. The circuit
   operates with 8MHz clock frequency and achieves 57.6dB Signal to Noise
   and Distortion Ratio (SNDR) with 20KHz bandwidth. At the mentioned clock
   frequency and 1.5V supply level, the circuit consumes less than 1mW
   power. Our HSPICE simulation results are in very good agreement with our
   simulated model based on second order modified all-pass transfer
   functions. The effective number of bits obtained from our implemented

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a reference governor-based approach to
   guarantee enforcement of critical flight constraints on the Altaeros
   tethered, lighter-than-air wind energy system. While the high-altitude
   flight made available by the tethered system leads to significant
   increases in power production over traditional, tower-mounted systems,
   the freedom of motion resulting from the tethers and aerodynamic shell
   introduces critical attitude and tether tension constraints. To date,
   methods considered for enforcing these constraints have relied upon
   heuristic static maps or model predictive control (MPC). The former
   cannot guarantee transient constraint satisfaction, whereas the latter
   is computationally burdensome given Altaeros's current microcontroller
   capabilities. The approach pursued in this paper uses a reference
   governor, which is a computationally simple add-on to the existing
   controller that enforces transient and steady-state constraints. The
   methodology proposed in this paper is demonstrated through simulations
   on linear and nonlinear models of the longitudinal dynamics of the
   Altaeros system with wind gust disturbances.}},

   detailed analysis to accurately capture the dynamics. Related work,
   which focused on thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), addressed
   state-space modelling by dividing the hysteresis deadband into equally
   sized bins and keeping track of the inter-bin migration of loads. A
   system of PEV chargers can be treated similarly. A new modelling
   paradigm has been developed to allow for fast variation of the
   hysteresis deadband. This model tracks the distribution of PEV chargers
   within the hysteresis deadband, with the inter-bin migration of chargers
   used to capture the aggregate dynamics.}},

   sea, equipped with one multi-function radar and multiple ships. The
   enemy (Red) force consists of missiles that target the Blue force's
   radar. The mission of the Blue force is to foil the enemy's threat by
   careful allocation of radar resources. Dynamically composed finite state
   machines are used to formalize the model of the battle space and dynamic
   programming is applied to our dynamic state machine model to generate an

Abstract = {{A battery management system (BMS) is responsible for protecting the
   battery from damage, predicting battery life, and maintaining the
   battery in an operational condition.
   In this paper, we propose an efficient way of predicting the power
   requirements of electric vehicles (EVs) based on a history of their
   power consumption, speed, and acceleration, as well as the road
   information from a pre-downloaded map. The predicted power requirement
   is then used by the BMS to prevent the damage of battery cells that
   might result from high discharge rates. This prediction also helps BMS
   efficiently schedule and allocate battery cells in real time to meet an
   EV's power demands. For accurate prediction of power requirements, we
   need an accurate model for the power requirement of each given
   application. We generate this model in real time by collecting and using
   historical data of power consumption, speed, acceleration, and road
   information such as slope and speed limit. By using this information and
   the operator's driving pattern, the model extracts the vehicle's history
   of speed and acceleration, which, in turn, enables the prediction of the
   vehicle's (immediate) future power requirements. That is, the power
   requirement prediction is achieved by combining a real-time power
   requirement model and the estimation of the vehicle's acceleration and
   speed. The proposed approach predicts closer to the actual required
   power than a widely-used heuristic approach that uses measured power
   demand, by up to 69.2\%.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in in-vehicle technologies have paved way to a new era
   of connectivity. Vehicle manufacturers have already deployed various
   technologies for driving assistance, anti-theft, and infotainment. They
   are now developing ways to interface mobile devices with vehicles and
   provide the customer's smartphone or tablet the ability to send/receive
   information to/from the car. However, such an integration introduces
   severe security risks to the vehicle. The in-vehicle network was
   originally designed to operate in a closed environment and thus,
   security was not of concern. It has now become an important issue due to
   an increasing number of external interfaces to the in-vehicle network.
   Several studies have already shown that an in-vehicle network can be
   easily compromised just by connecting cheap commercial devices and doing
   reverse engineering. Although research efforts have been made to secure
   in-vehicle networks, most of them focused on defining security
   requirements, or presenting attack scenarios without providing any
   feasible solution. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been
   any study with a specific focus on understanding and analyzing the
   security aspects of integrating mobile devices with cars. In this paper,
   we define the integration model, present the attack scenarios, define
   the security objectives, and then propose a 3-step verification
   mechanism that meets our objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative spectrum sensing has received considerable attention as a
   viable means to enhance the detection performance by exploiting spatial
   diversity in received signal strengths. However, this is vulnerable to
   sensing data falsification attacks due to the distributed nature of
   cooperative spectrum sensing. To overcome this problem, we introduce a
   primary user emulation test (PUET), under which a trustful central
   entity (e.g., a cellular base station) transmits a test signal while
   other users are sensing the spectrum. The core of PUET is to correlate
   the reported sensing data with the transmission power of the test
   signal. Since this test signal is, in reality, an interference to the
   sensing of a primary signal, sensors cannot distinguish the test signal
   from the primary signal. Considering this characteristic of sensors,
   PUET detects attacks by evaluating the consistency of channel
   parameters, which are not known to sensors. By recognizing this defense
   mechanism, PUET checks the validity of reports from each sensor
   separately. The efficacy of PUET is validated via experimentation on a
   testbed deployed in an indoor environment. Our measurement study shows
   that PUET achieves over 95\% detection rate while keeping the false
   alarm rate under 5\%.}},

   training data sets, then identify possible failure times for on-line
   testing units based on the constructed statistical model and available

   proposed to implement the methodology. First of all, a generic health
   index system is proposed to represent the health degradation of
   engineering systems. Next, a Copula-based modeling is proposed to build
   statistical relationship between failure time and the time realizations
   at specified degradation levels. Finally, a sampling approach is
   proposed to estimate the failure time and remaining useful life (RUL) of
   on-line testing units. Two case studies, including a bearing system in

Abstract = {{On-the-fly learning systems are necessary for the deployment of general
   purpose robots. New training examples for such systems are often
   supplied by mentor interactions. Due to the cost of acquiring such
   examples, it is desirable to reduce the number of necessary
   interactions. Transfer learning has been shown to improve classification
   results for classes with small numbers of training examples by pooling
   knowledge from related classes. Standard practice in these works is to
   assume that the relationship between the transfer target and related
   classes is already known.
   In this work, we explore how previously learned categories, or related
   groupings of classes, can be used to transfer knowledge to novel classes
   without explicitly known relationships to them. We demonstrate an
   algorithm for determining the category membership of a novel class,
   focusing on the difficult case when few training examples are available.
   We show that classifiers trained via this method outperform classifiers
   optimized to learn the novel class individually when evaluated on both
   synthetic and real-world datasets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the use of planar patches as features in a
   real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system to model
   smooth surfaces as piecewise-planar. This approach works well for using
   observed point clouds to correct odometry error, even when the point
   cloud is sparse. Such sparse point clouds are easily derived by Doppler
   velocity log sensors for underwater navigation. Each planar patch
   contained in this point cloud can be constrained in a factor-graph-based
   approach to SLAM so that neighboring patches are sufficiently coplanar
   so as to constrain the robot trajectory, but not so much so that the
   curvature of the surface is lost in the representation. To validate our
   approach, we simulated a virtual 6-degree of freedom robot performing a
   spiral-like survey of a sphere, and provide real-world experimental
   results for an autonomous underwater vehicle used for automated ship
   hull inspection. We demonstrate that using the sparse 3D point cloud
   greatly improves the self-consistency of the map. Furthermore, the use
   of our piecewise-planar framework provides an additional constraint to
   multi-session underwater SLAM, improving performance over monocular

Abstract = {{Reliable and accurate camera calibration usually requires an expert
   intuition to reliably constrain all of the parameters in the camera
   model. Existing toolboxes ask users to capture images of a calibration
   target in positions of their choosing, after which the
   maximum-likelihood calibration is computed using all images in a batch
   optimization. We introduce a new interactive methodology that uses the
   current calibration state to suggest the position of the target in the
   next image and to verify that the final model parameters meet the
   accuracy requirements specified by the user.
   Suggesting target positions relies on the ability to score candidate
   suggestions and their effect on the calibration. We describe two methods
   for scoring target positions: one that computes the stability of the
   focal length estimates for initializing the calibration, and another
   that subsequently quantifies the model uncertainty in pixel space.
   We demonstrate that our resulting system, AprilCal, consistently yields
   more accurate camera calibrations than standard tools using results from
   a set of human trials. We also demonstrate that our approach is
   applicable for a variety of lenses.}},

Abstract = {{It is challenging for a robot acting in the world to interact with and
   use novel objects. While a person may be able to look past visual
   differences and recognize the intended function of an object, doing so
   is more difficult for robots, which tend to rely on visual similarity to
   recognize categories of objects. A robot that recognizes and classifies
   objects based on their functional properties and potential capabilities
   is better prepared to use unknown objects.
   We propose a technique for functionally classifying objects using
   features obtained through physical simulations. The described method
   simulates spheres falling onto an object from above. We show how a
   feature vector can be derived from the results of the physics-based
   simulation, and that this feature vector is informative for a variety of
   affordance classification tasks. This process allows a robot equipped
   with a 3D sensor to determine the functionality of objects in its
   environment given only a few training examples from various function
   classes. We show that this method is able to accurately learn membership
   of 3D models in three function classes: ``drinking vessel{''},
   ``table{''}, and ``sittable{''}. We then show that this can be extended
   to 3D scans of objects using the models as training examples.}},

Abstract = {{Soft actuators are found throughout nature from elephant trunks to round
   worms, demonstrating large specific forces without the need for sliding
   components. These actuators offer impact resilience, human-safe
   interaction, versatility of motion, and scalability in size. Biological
   structures often use a fiber-reinforcement around a fluid filled
   elastomeric enclosure, in which the elastomeric material will capture
   the distributed pressure and transfer it to the fibers, which will in
   turn direct the forces to the ends. We previously discovered an entire
   domain of fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs), of which
   McKibben actuators are a small subset. The range of forces and moments
   possible with FREEs has not been previously investigated. 45 FREE
   actuators across the span of fiber angle configurations were fabricated
   and tested. The reaction force and moment of each actuator was
   determined across a gamut of pressures. Analytical models were generated
   using a variety of simplifying assumptions. These models were created to
   provide a closed form expression that models the force and moment data.
   The models were compared to the experimental values to determine their
   fit; this provides an understanding of which simplifying kinematic
   assumptions best represent the experimental results. Interpolated
   experimental results and the analytical models are all graphically
   represented for use as an intuitive design tool.}},

Abstract = {{Tendril helical motions and snake robots have a multitude of potential
   applications from climbing to anchoring to complex manipulation in
   fields such as medical, gas/oil energy, and manufacturing. Constructing
   a snake robot from a fluid driven, fiber reinforced elastomeric
   enclosure (FREE), complex helical motions are created in a lightweight,
   low cost, simple structure. The snake-like manipulators are created by
   forming a hollow cylindrical elastomer that is reinforced with two
   families of fibers and one additional fiber. The manipulator is then
   driven by changing the volume of fluid contained within, thus forming
   the desired helical patterns. The design of this continuum structure is
   analyzed for all possible fiber angles and the FREE radius. The
   parameters of the resulting helix including pitch and radius are
   determined analytically, without the need for finite element methods.
   Three prototypes at different points in the design space are fabricated

Abstract = {{An optical-electrical neural `Optrode' is developed for quantitative
   optical spectroscopic assessment of cortical tissue damage around a
   neural implant. In contrast to other Optrodes which illuminate tissue
   for neural activation, this work uses bi-directional waveguides to
   obtain spectroscopic information from the tissue. An optical assessment
   has the potential for providing a real-time histological assessment, by
   quantifying changes in absorption and scattering properties associated
   with oxygenation and tissue density around the neural probe, in contrast
   to impedance spectroscopy which provides limited insight. Optrode
   performance is characterized in optical tissue phantoms and a
   proof-of-concept chronic rat model is developed. Optrodes were
   chronically implanted in rat cerebral cortex. The pilot study
   demonstrates feasibility for chronic optical assessment. Future Optrodes
   may lead to high throughput and real-time assessments for studying the
   dynamic nature of the foreign body response in neural tissue.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to selectively deposit platinum black (PtB) on iridium
   microelectrodes and functionalize the surface for the purposes of
   choline sensing was investigated in this study. Platinum black was
   deposited by cycling 100-200 times between 0.5 V and -0.7 V in a
   solution of 1 mM K2PtCl6 in 0.1 M KCl. Deposition of PtB showed good
   chemical stability as well as good adhesion following insertion into
   agarose gel as a model for brain insertion. Electrode sites were also
   tested for their oxidative capabilities of hydrogen peroxide during
   which they showed high current change in response to small concentration
   changes - attributable to the high surface area of the PtB. Sites were
   then coated with an enzyme solution containing choline oxidase, and a
   permselective layer of meta-phenylenediamine was added to filter
   interferents. Electrode sites yielded a high sensitivity to choline
   compared to interferents including ascorbic acid and dopamine.}},

Abstract = {{The use of third-party libraries in deployed applications can
   potentially put an organization's intellectual property at risk due to
   licensing restrictions requiring disclosure or distribution of the
   resulting software. Binary applications that are statically linked to
   buggy version(s) of a library can also provide malware with entry points
   into an organization. While many organizations have policies to restrict
   the use of third-party software in applications, determining whether an
   application uses a restricted library can be difficult when it is
   distributed as binary code. Compiler optimizations, function inlining,
   and lack of symbols in binary code make the task challenging for
   automated techniques. On the other hand, semantic analysis techniques
   are relatively slow. Given a library and a set of binary applications,
   we propose Expose, a tool that combines symbolic execution using a
   theorem prover, and function-level syntactic matching techniques to
   achieve both performance and high quality rankings of applications.
   Higher rankings indicate a higher likelihood of reusing the library's
   code.
   Expose ranked applications that used two libraries at or near the top,
   out of 2,927 and 128 applications respectively. Expose detected one
   application that was not detected by another scanner to use some
   functions in one of the libraries. In addition, Expose ranked
   applications correctly for different versions of a library, and when
   different compiler options were used. Expose analyzed 97.68\% and
   99.48\% of the applications within five and 10 minutes respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The use of semantic attributes in computer vision problems has been
   gaining increased popularity in recent years. Attributes provide an
   intermediate feature representation in between low-level features and
   the class categories, leading to improved learning on novel categories
   from few examples. However, a major caveat is that learning semantic
   attributes is a laborious task, requiring a significant amount of time
   and human intervention to provide labels. In order to address this
   issue, we propose a weakly supervised approach to learn mid-level
   features, where only class-level supervision is provided during
   training. We develop a novel extension of the restricted Boltzmann
   machine (RBM) by incorporating a Beta-Bernoulli process factor potential
   for hidden units. Unlike the standard RBM, our model uses the class
   labels to promote category-dependent sharing of learned features, which
   tends to improve the generalization performance. By using semantic
   attributes for which annotations are available, we show that we can find
   correspondences between the learned mid-level features and the labeled
   attributes. Therefore, the mid-level features have distinct semantic
   characterization which is similar to that given by the semantic
   attributes, even though their labeling was not provided during training.
   Our experimental results on object recognition tasks show significant
   performance gains, outperforming existing methods which rely on manually
   labeled semantic attributes.}},

Abstract = {{We report the development and successful teaching of new laboratory
   experiments for a large introductory course in Electrical Engineering

   which they can easily relate; stimulate intuitive understanding of EE
   concepts; foster enjoyment of learning, and eventually, help them
   succeed in their own fields. The first experiment focuses on
   applications of Fourier series to the spectra of sounds of music played
   on a Virtual Keyboard (R). In the second experiment, students solder
   their own filter circuit to serve has low-pass/high-pass audio filters,
   and then they apply their filters to an excerpt of music, with the goal
   of understanding effects of the filter transfer function on the audio
   signal through listening. Both experiments expand the conventional range
   of application of theory and circuits in introductory courses (usually,
   only standard waveforms are used, e. g. sinusoidal and square). In the
   scheme of the entire course, all lab projects aim to introduce
   realistic, practical applications that pique student interest, show
   students the relevance of electrical engineering, and help them transfer
   their newly learned skills and experience to their own fields of work

Abstract = {{With classroom instruction undergoing a massive transformation to
   incorporate online learning techniques at unprecedented levels,
   technological advances have facilitated a range of mechanisms that
   improve teaching and learning. At the same time, these technological

   Although the impact and implications of cheating have often been
   studied, we feel that this problem experiences constant evolution, and
   the dynamics of cheating, especially in online courses, needs more
   examination to be fully grasped. The study presented here surveyed
   computer science, computer information systems, and engineering college
   students, with the goal of gaining a greater understanding of their
   perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes about the many dimensions of
   academic integrity violations. Results of this survey, coupled with
   statistical analysis and some conclusions, are presented.

   results of lateral mode intrinsically switchable bulk acoustic wave
   resonators based on the ferroelectric material barium titanate. Lateral
   dimensions of these devices determine their resonance frequencies,
   significantly simplifying the fabrication of monolithic multi-frequency
   circuits. By applying a dc bias, the resonance modes can be excited and
   the resonators are switched on. Resonator designs with parallel plate
   electrodes and interdigitated electrodes are demonstrated and have
   resonance frequencies from 160 MHz to 1.67 GHz. When the dc bias is
   removed, the resonances are switched off and the devices behave as

   the mean squared estimation error is formulated as a dynamic program. An
   optimal policy is given for the case of two sensing stages. For more
   than two stages, tractable approximate policies are developed based on
   open-loop feedback control (OLFC). These policies improve monotonically
   with the number of stages, and in particular upon the optimal two-stage
   policy. A spectrum sensing simulation shows substantial reductions in
   mean squared error compared to non-adaptive sensing and a recently
   proposed adaptive method. Performance gains in detecting unoccupied

Abstract = {{Recovering the spatial layout of cluttered indoor scenes is a
   challenging problem. Current methods generate layout hypotheses from
   vanishing point estimates produced using 2D image features. This method
   fails in highly cluttered scenes in which most of the image features
   come from clutter instead of the room's geometric structure. In this
   paper, we propose to use human detections as cues to more accurately
   estimate the vanishing points. Our method is built on top of the fact
   that people are often the focus of indoor scenes, and that the scene and
   the people within the scene should have consistent geometric
   configurations in 3D space. We contribute a new data set of highly
   cluttered indoor scenes containing people, on which we provide baselines
   and evaluate our method. This evaluation shows that our approach
   improves 3D interpretation of scenes.}},

Title = {{Stability Analysis of Vehicle Negotiating a Curve in the Plane}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The steering stability of vehicle was the most important part of vehicle
   handling and stability. The stability analysis of vehicle negotiating a
   curve in the plane was studied through simulation. The vehicle dynamics
   model used in this paper had two degrees of freedom with nonlinear tire
   characteristics. When two vehicle state variables, namely, velocity and
   steering angle, were changed, the GA and phase space analysis were used
   to compute the equilibrium points and analyze the phase space
   characteristics of vehicle system. Considering the nonlinear tire
   characteristic, the working region of tire was figured out and compared,
   while the vehicle was under different operating conditions. From the
   analysis results, it could be concluded that working in the nonlinear
   region of tire characteristic was the ultimate reason of vehicle
   instability. The knowledge derived from simulation results could
   dramatically enhance the understanding of stability of the actual
   vehicle negotiating a curve on an even surface. Such knowledge was a
   prerequisite for robustly designing the chassis, such as steer-by-wire,
   which would be the topics of future work.}},

Abstract = {{Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) semiconductor quantum dots are an
   attractive candidate for scalable room temperature quantum photonics
   applications owing to their large exciton binding energy and large
   oscillation strength. Previously, we reported single photon emission
   from site-controlled InGaN quantum dot structures. However, large
   homogeneous linewidth and significant non-radiative recombination were
   thought to be linked to the nearby surface charge centers. These charge
   centers can lead to spectral diffusion and excessive non-radiative
   recombinations at high temperature. In this work, ammonium sulfide
   passivation was investigated. Nitrogen vacancies were successfully
   passivated by ammonium sulfide ((NH4)(2)S-x) treatment, and the emission
   linewidth of a single quantum dot was reduced by 5 meV. Furthermore, the
   linewidth broadening with an increasing temperature was suppressed in
   the temperature range from 9 K to 95 K in this study. Satellite emission
   peak believed to be associated with the nitrogen vacancy was observed
   for un-passivated quantum dots. The satellite peak was 55 similar to 80
   meV away from the main InGaN emission peak and was eliminated after
   sulfide passivation.}},

Abstract = {{The extant research on engineering ethics instruction shows that
   students receive ethics instruction within the engineering curricula.
   Unfortunately, the methods used in engineering undergraduate classrooms
   are described as ``abstract'' and have mixed results related to
   impacting students' ethical development. Thus, exploring how
   out-of-classroom experiences-as a curricular alternative-influences
   students' ethical development is warranted. This is an exploratory
   investigation to determine how out-of-classroom experiences influence
   students' ethical development. The authors define ethical development
   using three constructs: knowledge of ethics, ethical reasoning, and
   ethical behavior. We draw upon a conceptual model that suggests
   students' ethical development is impacted by what takes place inside and
   outside of the classroom. As the first phase of a multi-year, national
   study to holistically assess the ethical development of engineering
   undergraduates in the United States, we conducted focus groups
   consisting of faculty members and students at 18 institutions. All focus
   group participants were asked questions related to campus climate,
   ethics, and involvement in out-of-classroom experiences. Our data
   suggest that participating in out-of-classroom experiences: served as a
   complement to the classroom instruction on ethics; helped students
   connect learning about ethics to the engineering workplace; and,
   influenced students' ethical development. Given what we learned about
   the engineering undergraduates' involvement in out-of-classroom
   experiences, we suggest that engineering faculty members use classroom
   instruction to connect out-of-classroom experiences to ethics and
   encourage reflective practice in ethics instruction.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{879-890}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the outcomes of a study of first-year engineering
   student perceptions of creative opportunities in engineering design
   tasks. The study was guided by three key questions: (1) How do
   first-year engineering students view creativity and its role in
   engineering? (2) What opportunities do students see for creativity in
   their engineering design projects? (3) How do various factors, including
   the course structure and the instructor, influence student choices to
   pursue creative opportunities? First-year engineering students
   participated in four surveys during the semester in which they were
   working on an engineering design project. Overall, the participants
   perceived many creative opportunities; however, the opportunities they
   saw at the beginning of their work were greater and broader, while once
   into their projects, the scope of their perceptions narrowed. Throughout
   the design project, the instructor, project constraints, and risks
   associated with exploring a creative design option influenced the
   participants' perceptions. The research outcomes can guide how
   instructors advise student decision-making and structure their design
   courses to facilitate creativity.}},

Pages = {{1100-1108}},
Abstract = {{Presented in this paper is a description of the guest speaker series
   model established in a long-standing civil engineering course at the
   University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. In the Winter 2010 semester, the
   author launched an industry based guest speaker series called People I
   Wish I had Met Before Graduating (TM) to further enrich the educational
   experience of students in CEE 431, Construction Contracting. Success of
   the series based on student testimonials and surveys led to its
   recognition by the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department as a
   valuable resource and its utilization by fellow faculty in CEE 431 and
   other departmental initiatives. Among the contributions of the speaker
   series are the creation of a faculty resource containing a description
   of the series and its correlation with the curriculum and course
   objectives, a library of speaker topics relevant to professionals and
   academicians in the industry, a roster of speakers and established key
   talking points, a template for a student resource packet, and a survey.
   Typically, speaker series are offered in seminar-type courses. The model
   presented in this paper differs in that the speaker series had to be
   selectively assembled and incorporated into a traditional course with a
   specific, pre-defined curriculum such that it became an integral and
   meaningful part of the overall educational experience. This was the
   first time a guest speaker series had been established for CEE 431 at
   the University of Michigan, representing a significant change to the
   standards of practice. There is no documentation available to verify how
   widespread this practice is for comparable courses at other
   institutions, suggesting that it is uncommon. The following sections
   discuss the rationale behind the speaker series; provide a course
   description, including, curriculum and objectives; describe the speaker
   series model, including topics, structure and, the series application by
   others; present students' assessment of the series through testimonials
   and surveys; and offer conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{A thermodynamically-based work potential theory for modeling progressive
   damage and failure in fiber-reinforced laminates is presented. The
   current, multiple-internal state variable (ISV) formulation, referred to

   the effects of damage and failure. Consistent characteristic lengths are
   introduced into the formulation to govern the evolution of the failure
   ISVs. Using the stationarity of the total work potential with respect to
   each ISV, a set of thermodyamically consistent evolution equations for
   the ISVs are derived. The theory is implemented into a commercial finite
   element code. The model is verified against experimental results from
   two laminated, T800/3900-2 panels containing a central notch and
   different fiber-orientation stacking sequences. Global load versus
   displacement, global load versus local strain gage data, and macroscopic
   failure paths obtained from the models are compared against the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general, exact, two-dimensional (2D) elastodynamic
   analysis of the response of laminated composite panels subjected to
   transverse impact loading under conditions of planar deformation. The
   natural frequencies and mode shapes of free vibrationn are first
   extracted. Inspired by a transformation technique for solving a special
   class of partial differential equations (PDEs), the forced vibration
   problem of an impacted laminated panel is solved using an eigen-function
   expansion technique. Several examples are studied by varying the
   laminate lay-up and length-to-thickness ratio. The distributions of
   transverse stresses in the through-the-thickness direction are further
   compared with two one-dimensional theories, Classical Lamination Theory
   (CLT) and First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT), showing the
   inadequacy of these theories and the necessity to establish a benchmark
   solution for 2D elastodynamics. The 2D elastodynamic theory that is
   formulated is also applicable for studying other multilayered structures
   subjected to arbitrary loading profiles.}},

   Health Monitoring (SHM) systems, which is based on Savitzky-Golay filter
   and time-domain analysis. In this technique, a specific PZT (actuator)
   excites the structure and three other ones are used as sensors to
   receive the structural responses. This method is quite similar to Lamb
   wave based methods, but the excitation procedure and the analysis of the
   response signals are different. For the proposed method, a wide band
   chirp signal, with low amplitude and variable frequency, is used to
   excite the structure. The response signals are acquired in time-domain
   and smoothed by a Savitzky-Golay filter, and from the filtered signals
   the first and second derivatives are computed. CCDM (Correlation
   Coefficient Deviation Metric) indices are calculated from all signals
   (smoothed, first and second derivatives), considering the structure a
   healthy condition as a reference (baseline). Practical tests were
   carried out on an aluminum plate and the results have demonstrated the

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a model-free and reference-free decentralized
   sensor fault identification algorithm ideally suited for wireless sensor
   networks. Since wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are adopted in many
   large-scale applications, fault detection of sensors becomes an
   important subject, especially for low-cost nodes. The common
   energy-limited characteristic of WSNs, however, makes centralized or
   complex fault detection algorithms unfavorable. We developed an energy
   efficient algorithm based on pair-wise comparison. The linear
   relationship between the outputs of sensor pairs is used to reveal the
   faulty sensors. The input of the system and knowledge of reference
   sensors are not required for this method. We also present how to pair
   sensors in order to minimize power consumption. The performance and
   limitations of the algorithm are discussed and verified by simulations.
   Results show that even when error power is comparable to the output
   signal power and the observation noise level is high, the algorithm is
   still able to detect most of the faults. Moreover, the decentralized
   approach reduces the power consumption of the WSN significantly when
   compared with the traditional centralized method.}},

Abstract = {{A broadband terahertz intensity modulator based on MEMS-reconfigurable
   mesh filters is presented and experimentally demonstrated. Modulator
   operation is based on reconfiguring the geometry of a multi-layer mesh
   filter from a capacitive configuration to an inductive configuration,
   which alters device scattering parameters from a low-pass filter to a
   high-pass filter, respectively. The geometry of the multi-layer mesh
   filter is chosen to allow cut-off frequencies beyond 3 THz, enabling
   terahertz modulation over a broad range of frequencies. Additionally,
   arrays of multi-contact electrostatic MEMS switches are integrated with
   the multi-layer mesh filter, enabling the required geometry
   reconfiguration within a fully integrated and high-speed device
   solution. We experimentally demonstrate more than 65\% modulation depth
   over 1.5 THz frequency band, under a modulation voltage of 30 V and

Pages = {{11643-11660}},
Abstract = {{Data assimilation (DA) approaches, including variational and the
   ensemble Kalman filter methods, provide a computationally efficient
   framework for solving the CO2 source-sink estimation problem. Unlike DA
   applications for weather prediction and constituent assimilation,
   however, the advantages and disadvantages of DA approaches for CO2 flux
   estimation have not been extensively explored. In this study, we compare
   and assess estimates from two advanced DA approaches (an ensemble square
   root filter and a variational technique) using a batch inverse modeling
   setup as a benchmark, within the context of a simple one-dimensional
   advection-diffusion prototypical inverse problem that has been designed
   to capture the nuances of a real CO2 flux estimation problem.
   Experiments are designed to identify the impact of the observational
   density, heterogeneity, and uncertainty, as well as operational
   constraints (i.e., ensemble size, number of descent iterations) on the
   DA estimates relative to the estimates from a batch inverse modeling
   scheme. No dynamical model is explicitly specified for the DA approaches
   to keep the problem setup analogous to a typical real CO2 flux
   estimation problem. Results demonstrate that the performance of the DA
   approaches depends on a complex interplay between the measurement
   network and the operational constraints. Overall, the variational
   approach (contingent on the availability of an adjoint transport model)
   more reliably captures the large-scale source-sink patterns. Conversely,
   the ensemble square root filter provides more realistic uncertainty
   estimates. Selection of one approach over the other must therefore be
   guided by the carbon science questions being asked and the operational
   constraints under which the approaches are being applied.}},

   the multiple types of enteric viruses particularly in winter months
   identified much more significant prevalence of key viral pathogens

   previously realized and seasonal disinfection used in some parts of the

Abstract = {{The main focus of this paper is to introduce a computationally efficient
   algorithm for solving image recovery problems, regularized by the
   recently introduced higher degree total variation (HDTV) penalties. The
   anisotropic HDTV penalty is the fully separable L 1 semi-norm of the
   directional image derivatives; the use of this penalty is seen to
   considerably improve image quality in biomedical inverse problems. We
   introduce a novel majorize minimize algorithm to solve the HDTV
   optimization problem, thus considerably speeding it over the previous
   implementation. Specifically, comparisons with previous iterative
   reweighted algorithm show an approximate ten fold speedup. The new
   algorithm enables us to obtain reconstructions that are free of patchy
   artifacts exhibited by classical TV schemes, while being comparable to
   state of the art total variation regularization schemes in run time.}},

Abstract = {{Spoke RF pulse design in MRI requires joint optimization of the k-space
   trajectory and RF pulse weights. This design task is often modelled as a
   sparse approximation problem with a cost function evaluating the l(2)
   norm of the excitation error, which can be approximately solved using
   the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. However, l(2)
   optimization does not strictly regulate a maximum deviation between
   excitation and desired patterns, and may leave bright or dark spots in
   the image. In this paper, we model the pulse design problem as a sparse
   approximation problem with an l(infinity) norm cost function, and
   propose a greedy algorithm for solving this new problem. Simulation
   results demonstrate that our algorithm can produce improved spoke RF
   pulses (reduced maximum error) compared to l(2) optimization.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of progressive failure on flood embankments with underlying
   thin layers of soft, sensitive soils are investigated. Finite element
   analysis allows for investigation of strain-softening effects and
   progressive failure in soft and sensitive soils. However, limit
   equilibrium methods for slope stability analysis, widely used in
   industry, cannot capture these effects and may result in unconservative
   factors of safety. A parametric analysis was conducted to investigate
   the effect of thin layers of soft sensitive soils on the stability of
   flood embankments. A flood embankment was modeled using both the limit
   equilibrium method and the finite element method. The foundation profile
   was altered to determine the extent to which varying soft and sensitive
   soils affected the stability of the embankment, with respect to
   progressive failure. The results from the two methods were compared to
   determine reduction factors that can be applied towards factors of
   safety computed using limit equilibrium methods, in order to capture
   progressive failure.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the internal temperatures of an electric machine under
   real-time operating conditions would be extremely useful in order to
   determine its torque capabilities. This knowledge is also useful for
   full-scale electric or hybrid electric vehicle (EV/HEV) simulation and
   optimization. In this paper, we present a technique for developing
   computationally-efficient thermal models for electric machines that can
   be used for real-time thermal observers and EV/HEV powertrain-level
   simulation and optimization. The technique is based upon simulating
   eigenmodes of the thermal dynamics as determined by 3D finite element
   analysis. The order of the model is then dramatically reduced in two
   ways. First, the dynamic system is decomposed into two parts by using
   the orthogonality property of the eigenvectors. The extent of excitation
   of each eigenmode is calculated, and only eigenmodes that are
   significantly excited are included in the dynamic model; other
   eigenmodes are treated as static modes. Second, only the temperatures in
   few ``hots pots{''} in various regions of the machine are chosen. By
   using the proposed model order reduction techniques, the computation
   time of the model is shown to be reduced by over five orders of
   magnitude, while maintaining sufficient accuracy. Experimental work also
   shows a good agreement between simulation results and measured data.}},

Abstract = {{The voltage and torque equation are written in terms of flux variables
   (lambda(d), lambda(q)), instead of currents. Also, the voltage and
   current limits are depicted in the plane of (lambda(d), lambda(q)). Then
   the voltage limits appear as circles centered at the origin, whereas the
   current limit appear as an ellipse. In the field weakening region, the
   voltage is utilized to the maximum. Hence, the only thing allowed to
   change in the field weakening region is the angle of the voltage so as
   to accommodate changes in speed and torque. In the flux setting, the
   voltage angle can be determined by an intersection point between the
   voltage circle and a torque line. That solution will be the copper loss
   minimizing point. However, it requires to solve a four order polynomial
   equation. In this work, a Taylor series approximation method is utilized
   to circumvent the difficulty of solving the fourth order equation.
   Desired performances were demonstrated by some experimental results.}},

   Cell Ablation}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{851-864}},
Abstract = {{This paper is an initial work towards developing an image-guided,
   targeted ultrasound ablation technique by combining histotripsy with
   nanodroplets that can be selectively delivered to tumor cells. Using
   extremely short, high-pressure pulses, histotripsy generates a dense
   cloud of cavitating microbubbles that fractionates tissue. We
   hypothesize that synthetic nanodroplets that encapsulate a
   perfluoropentane (PFP) core will transition upon exposure to ultrasound
   pulses into gas microbubbles, which will rapidly expand and collapse
   resulting in disruption of cells similar to the histotripsy process but
   at a significantly lower acoustic pressure. The significantly reduced
   cavitation threshold will allow histotripsy to be selectively delivered
   to the tumor tissue and greatly enhance the treatment efficiency while
   sparing neighboring healthy tissue. To test our hypothesis, we prepared
   nanodroplets with an average diameter of 204 +/- 4.7 nm at 37 degrees C
   by self-assembly of an amphiphilic triblock copolymer around a PFP core
   followed by cross-linkage of the polymer shell forming stable
   nanodroplets. The nanodroplets were embedded in agarose tissue phantoms
   containing a sheet of red blood cells (RBCs), which were exposed to
   2-cycle pulses applied by a 500 kHz focused transducer. Using a high
   speed camera to monitor microbubble generation, the peak negative
   pressure threshold needed to generate bubbles >50 mu m in agarose
   phantoms containing nanodroplets was measured to be 10.8 MPa, which is
   significantly lower than the 28.8 MPa observed using ultrasound pulses
   alone. High speed images also showed cavitation microbubbles produced
   from the nanodroplets displayed expansion and collapse similar to
   histotripsy alone at higher pressures. Nanodroplet-mediated histotripsy
   created consistent, well-defined fractionation of the RBCs in agarose
   tissue phantoms at 10 Hz pulse repetition frequency similar to the
   lesions generated by histotripsy alone but at a significantly lower
   pressure. These results support our hypothesis and demonstrate the
   potential of using nanodroplet-mediated histotripsy for targeted cell
   ablation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computationally efficient thermal model of a
   cylindrical lithium ion battery for real-time applications. Such a model
   can be used for thermal management of the battery system in electrified
   vehicles. The thermal properties are modeled by volume averaged lumped
   values under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic volume. A
   polynomial approximation is then used to estimate the radial temperature
   distribution that arises from heat generation inside the cell during
   normal operation. Unlike previous control oriented models, which use
   discretization of the heat equation, this model formulation uses two
   states to represent the average value of temperature and its gradient.
   The model is parameterized using experimental data from a 2.3 Ah 26650
   Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LiFePO4 or LFP) battery cell. Finally, a Kalman
   filter is applied based on the reduced order thermal model using
   measurements of current, voltage and surface temperature of the cell and
   ambient temperature. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
   validated against core temperature measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The voltage of lithium ion batteries is usually monitored to prevent
   overcharge and overdischarge. For battery packs consisting of hundreds
   of cells, monitoring the voltage of every single cell adds significant
   cost and complexity to the battery management system (BMS). Reducing
   voltage sensing by only measuring the total voltage of multiple cells in
   series connection is desirable if the state of charge (SOC) of
   individual cells can be correctly estimated. Such goal cannot be
   achieved by an extended Kalman filter, because the cell SOCs are not
   observable in the linearized battery string model. In this paper, an
   observer based on solving simultaneously multiple nonlinear equations
   along the trajectory of SOC evolution is used for the estimation
   problem. Existence of the solution depends on the nonlinearity of the
   battery voltage-SOC relationship. The observer is applied to a
   LiFePO4/graphite battery string with 2 cells, where the individual cell
   SOCs are observable in low and high SOC ranges. Experimental results
   show good convergence of SOC and voltage estimation, indicating that
   this new methodology can be applied to, at least, halve the voltage
   sensing in a battery pack.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to predict the torque and power consumption of a tracked
   robot, a.k.a., small unmanned ground vehicle (SUGV) is important for its
   design. Accurate torque and power consumption prediction enables motion
   planning that does not exceed the torque and power limitations of the
   propulsion system or the terrain. Due to the fact that skid steering may
   consume a large percentage of the propulsion power of tracked SUGVs, it
   must be included in any accurate power analysis. Modeling of skid
   steering of tracks is difficult on soft soils because of the track-soil
   interaction and the distributed nature of shear stress along the contact
   area. This study begins with a general theory of skid steering
   track-soil interaction at steady state. A fast yet accurate 2-D
   simplified model is then developed, which is solved with pre-calculated
   skid steering resistance coefficient maps. Subsequently a quadratic
   equation for internal power consumption is obtained experimentally. The
   simplified model is verified using the experimental data obtained from
   an iRobot Packbot driving on dry sand.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic control policies are developed for fuel-efficient following
   of a lead vehicle moving at a constant speed. Assuming that a lead
   vehicle is travelling at a specified speed and that the road grade is
   modeled stochastically, we solve numerically a Stochastic Dynamic
   Programming (SDP) problem to determine follower vehicle speed control
   policies subject to constraints on vehicle following distance. The cost
   function to which SDP is applied reflects fuel consumption, travel time
   and includes a penalty for distance constraint violation. A virtual
   testing environment based on CarSim is used for simulations and fuel
   economy assessment. We demonstrate the potential for fuel consumption
   improvements (over 5\%) and examine properties of the speed control
   policy of the follower vehicle, including the emergent `pulse and glide'
   behavior. The policies do not require preview information of the route
   and of the road grade thereby providing a potentially simpler
   alternative to preview-based systems. The results complement our
   previous results on fuel efficient in traffic driving.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the potential advantages of FIR model structures, the
   present paper considers the applicability of FIR models to closed-loop
   identification of open-loop-unstable plants. We show that FIR models can
   be used effectively for closed-loop identification of open-loop-unstable
   plants. The key insight in this regard is to realize that a noncausal
   FIR model can serve as a truncated Laurent expansion inside the annulus
   between the asymptotically stable pole of largest modulus and the
   unstable pole of smallest modulus. The key to identifying the noncausal
   plant model is to delay the measured output relative to the measured
   input. With this techniques, the identified FIR model is precisely a
   noncausal approximation of the unstable plant, that is, an approximation
   of the Laurent expansion of the plant inside the annulus of analyticity
   lying between the disk of stable poles and the punctured plane of
   unstable poles.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the performance of a team of dichotomous
   classifiers, where the classifiers' decisions are combined by logical
   fusion rules. Three decision structures are derived using the confusion
   matrix of a single classifier and a priori information, and the
   performances of the different decision structures are compared. First,
   we consider the performance of a team of three classifiers with a total
   of 256 fusion rules. Then, we propose a decision structure that utilizes
   a moderator, i.e., an entity that exploits Bayesian inference from
   individual classifiers' decisions and makes final decisions based on
   maximum likelihood classification. We show the benefits of using a
   moderator (compared to a decision structure without a moderator).
   Finally, we propose a decision structure that exploits pairing, i.e.,
   fusing the classifiers' decisions sequentially two-by-two. Two pairing
   schemes, i.e., incremental and tournament-like, are proposed and we show
   that incremental pairing is the most effective decision structure among
   the proposed ones.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) face many mobility challenges as they
   operate in unstructured environments. In addition to insurmountable
   obstacles, UGVs can lose traction and slip, reducing maneuverability and
   potentially causing collisions with obstacles. This paper develops a
   dynamic model of a differentially-driven ground robot with lateral and
   longitudinal slip, using a ground friction model from the literature. A
   novel switching control system, with velocity input commands, is also
   presented. The controller switches from PID control to a trajectory
   planning mode when the robot begins to slip or when the normal command
   would exceed the ground friction forces. The trajectory is planned and
   executed based on commanded velocities. Stability and robustness of the
   trajectory planning controller are discussed. This control law is
   compared in simulation to a PID controller, using the UGV model, on
   different surfaces. The traction controller drives the UGV closer to the
   desired path derived from the reference trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{The fuel governor control design methodology presented in {[}1] is
   extended and experimentally validated on a multicylinder recompression
   homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine. This strategy
   regulates desired combustion phasing during load transitions across the
   HCCI load range. A baseline controller tracks combustion phasing by
   manipulating valve and fuel injection timings. A reference governor is
   then added on to the compensated system to modify the fuel injection
   amount by enforcing actuator constraints.
   Experimental results show improved transient responses of combustion
   phasing and load during load transitions, when the possibility of
   constraint violations exists. The nonlinear fuel governor predicts
   future model trajectories in real-time, and enables larger load
   transitions than were possible with the baseline controller alone. The
   complexity and computational overhead of this strategy are reduced by
   developing a linearized fuel governor, which is shown to work well in
   the entire HCCI load range and for small variations in engine speed.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction of combustion phasing cyclic variability (CV) in homogeneous
   charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines operating lean with late
   autoignition is experimentally demonstrated. A three-state discrete time
   model developed in {[}1] is used for controlling the fuel injection
   timing and is applied to a multicylinder engine. A key objective of this
   work is to reduce cyclic variability without advancing the mean
   combustion phasing. Specifically, if late combustion phasing can be made
   less variable without advancing the operating point then areas where
   high CV is typically encountered could be made less variable. Examples
   include load transition down, when the residual temperature drops more
   rapidly than can be manipulated by the valve timing, or during mode
   transitions.
   Experimental results are presented to gauge the effectiveness of two
   control schemes, namely proportional and state feedback which have been
   tuned using the three-state model. Each of these controllers have been
   augmented with an integrator to maintain the late combustion phasing
   requirement. This is also done to draw a fair comparison of the
   controllers ability to reduce CV. The controllers are tested at various
   levels of CV and it is found that simple control can reduce the standard
   deviation of combustion phasing an average of 17\% over open loop
   behavior. In addition, because of the simplicity of the control, this
   offers a viable solution for commercial applications.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for designing a parallel, passive-assist device to augment
   an active system using energy minimization based on a known maneuver is

   concept experimentally on a single link robot arm augmented with a
   torsional spring. Here we show that the concept can effectively be
   applied to other machines performing known periodic motions by
   simulating a reciprocating single axis machining table and an X-Y table
   performing a slot milling operation. The addition of optimized springs
   results in a decrease in energy consumption of 79\% and significantly
   outperforms springs based on a state-of-the-art force-displacement
   curve-fitting approach. Finally, we show that a significant increase in
   performance can be realized if the maneuver is redesigned considering
   that a passive-assist device will be added to the system.}},

Abstract = {{A finite horizon stochastic optimal control problem is considered for an
   energy harvester driven by the jump-diffusion excitation. The dynamics
   of the harvester include a constant time-delay and a retardation
   (distributed delay) term. The jump component accounts for abrupt changes
   in the excitation signal. The optimal control is characterized based on
   the dynamic programming. In the delay-free and retardation term-free
   cases, constructing the optimal control reduces to solving a system of
   ordinary differential equations backward-in-time. Thus the inclusion of
   the jump terms in the model does not significantly complicate the
   optimal control and optimal cost construction. With delay and/or
   retardation terms present, it is demonstrated that a set of
   appropriately formulated Partial Differential Equations need to be
   solved. The approach enables the quantification of limits on achievable
   performance by the energy harvester in terms of amounts of energy that
   can be extracted when jump-diffusion input excitation is present. A
   computational example for a delay free case is reported.}},

Abstract = {{Iterative Learning Control (ILC) is a technique for improving the
   performance of processes which repeatedly perform a task defined over a
   finite interval. Traditional ILC is used to improve trajectory tracking
   across an entire cycle period. However, there exist applications (pick
   n' place, surveillance) in which only specific locations are of
   particular interest. For these applications, point-to-point ILC results
   in improved tracking at the selected points and enhanced controller
   flexibility between locations. The additional control freedom can be
   used to maximize the performance of additional performance metrics.
   Pareto optimization is a multi-objective approach in which two or more
   conflicting objectives exist. In this paper, the point-to-point ILC
   framework is reformatted into a pareto optimization-based ILC approach
   in which two or more performance metrics are incorporated into the
   controller design. The modified framework enables the controller to
   leverage the additional control flexibility from a point-to-point
   approach to maximize multiple performance objectives. Convergence and
   performance analysis for the novel control framework is presented.
   Simulation results validate the control framework and demonstrate
   trade-offs in the performance metrics as a function of controller
   design.}},

Abstract = {{A model reference optimal control architecture for the real-time fluid
   control of eliminating a contaminant plume from a pipe system was
   introduced in an earlier paper {[}1]. The mathematical model for the
   contaminant flow, is now extended and parameterized based on
   computational fluid dynamic simulations of a two-dimensional (2D)
   channel. It is also shown, based on the computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) simulations, that the 2D-based mathematical model can be used for
   three-dimensional (3D) pipe flow problem under certain constraints.
   Finally, we also derive a very simple control law of the flow rate in a
   boundary port that would remove a contaminant if the flow was a
   theoretical 2D flow. This simple control law can initialize the
   iterative process of computing the optimal flow based on a more complex
   model and real-time measurements. With the results in this article, the
   optimal control architecture can be tested in the real-time prototype
   experiments. Further improvements on the mathematical model and control
   algorithm can be made for real life pipe-line fluid control problems.}},

Abstract = {{Typical unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) rely on rechargeable batteries
   for operation, so it is essential to ensure that the batteries will not
   be exhausted unexpectedly before the completion of the UGV mission. This
   demands an accurate model to predict the UGV mission energy requirement.
   For this purpose, two model estimation methods were proposed in the
   earlier work {[}1] using a vehicle longitudinal dynamics model. The
   first method used the least squares estimation (LSE) without using
   mission prior knowledge. The other method used Bayesian estimation to
   consider mission prior knowledge (e. g., road grade and rolling
   resistance). In this paper, we have validated several aspects of the
   methods via experiments, which includes: (1) evaluation of the
   measurement sensor capability, (2) examination of relationship between
   power consumption and vehicle velocity as well as road grade, (3)
   investigation of the estimation of UGV internal resistance, (4) study of
   the effect of different road surface conditions on power consumption,
   and (5) comparison of the performance between the proposed LSE and
   Bayesian estimation approaches in predicting the mission energy
   requirement. Therefore, the vehicle dynamic model has been validated. It
   has also been verified that the Bayesian estimation method is able to
   predict UGV energy consumption more accurately than the LSE method.}},

Abstract = {{In the design of hybrid vehicles, it is important to identify proper
   component sizes. When the search space of the design problem is large,
   exhaustive power management strategy such as dynamic programming (DP) is
   too time-consuming to be feasible. Instead, a near-optimal method that
   is orders of magnitude faster than DP is needed. One such near-optimal
   method is developed and presented in this paper. This method is applied
   to design an input-split hybrid vehicle utilizing a single planetary
   gear (PG). There are 6 possible input split configurations, and each
   configuration has up to 4 modes {[}1]. Based on the analysis of the
   efficiency of powertrain components of the four modes, and the
   ``Power-weighted Efficiency{''} (PE) concept, we show that the
   computation time for each sizing problem can be reduced by a factor of
   10,000 compared with the dynamic-programming based approach.}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatically-actuated MEMS mirrors are used in a variety of
   applications ranging from mass sensing, gyroscopes, resonators, and
   displays to, more recently, endoscopic imaging, as for premalignant
   cancer detection. The aim of this work is to analytically and
   experimentally characterize the dynamics and stability of a 1D torsional
   micro-mirror undergoing parametric resonance for use in biomedical
   imaging. Analysis focuses on the effects of duty cycle variations on the
   stability and amplitude of micro-mirror motion. Additionally, the paper
   explores how proportional control can be implemented with duty cycle as
   the input to ensure that the desired scanning angles for imaging can be
   obtained. The paper outlines fundamental and simplifying assumptions
   made for each analysis, discusses the validity of associated models, and
   compares analytical outcomes to respective experimental results.
   Analytical models agree reasonably with experimental models in stability
   predictions at modest voltages and can provide more limited predictions
   of amplitudes given sufficient prior experimentation to estimate damping
   coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses using the battery energy storage system (BESS) to
   mitigate wind power intermittency, so that wind power can be
   dispatchable on an hourly basis like fossil fuel power plants. In
   particular, model predictive control (MPC) is used to control the charge
   and discharge of BESS to compensate for wind power forecast errors and
   minimize operation costs to the wind farm owner. A ramp rate penalty on
   wind power scheduling is included in the optimization to make the
   optimal control trajectory smoother, while the performance is kept
   intact. Numerical simulations with a one-year long wind power dataset
   show that MPC controller is much more effective in reducing the
   operation cost to the wind farm owner than the heuristic control
   algorithm or conventional reserves, in that BESS with a much smaller
   capacity will be suffice to achieve the same cost reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Optofluidic lasers combine the advantages of microfluidics and laser
   technology. Unlike traditional lasers, optofluidic lasers obtain the
   optical feedback from microfluidic channels with gain media (e. g.,
   dyes) inside. Due to the small size of microfluidic channels,
   optofluidic lasers own the unique capabilities in terms of handling
   liquid of pL similar to mu L volumes. Therefore, there is currently a
   great deal of interest in adapting optofluidic lasers for compact laser
   light sources and micro-total-analysis systems. Here, we use two
   examples to demonstrate the feasibility of using optofluidic lasers to
   sensitively detect DNA and protein. In the first example, the
   optofluidic laser is used to detect small conformational change in DNA
   Holliday junctions. The DNA Holliday junction has four branched
   double-helical arm structures, each of which is conjugated with Cy3 or
   Cy5 as the donor/acceptor pair. The conformational changes of the
   Holliday junction lead to the changes of fluorescence resonance energy
   transfer (FRET) between the donor and the acceptor. Using the optical
   feedback provided by the optofluidic laser, we are able to achieve
   nearly 100\% wavelength switching. The FRET signal generated by the
   optofluidic laser is about 16 times more sensitive to DNA conformational
   changes than the conventional method. The second example is concerned
   with a fluorescent proteins laser. Green, yellow, and red optofluidic
   lasers based on fluorescent proteins are demonstrated, and the lasing
   threshold of 3 mu M mCitrine is only 1 mu J/mm(2). This work will
   potentially open a door to study protein-protein interactions via the
   sensitive intra-cavity laser detection method.}},

Pages = {{11188-11196}},
Abstract = {{The desire to synthesize soft supramolecular structures with size scales
   similar to biological systems has led to work in assembly of polymeric
   nanomaterials. Recent advances in the isolation of generationally
   homogenous poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer enables their use as
   quantized building blocks. Here, we report their assembly into precise
   nanoclusters. In this work, click-functional ligands are stochastically
   conjugated to monomeric generation 5 PAMAM dendrimer and separated via
   reversephase HPLC to isolate dendrimers with precise numbers of click
   ligands per dendrimer particle. The clickligand/ dendrimer conjugates
   are then employed as modular building blocks for the synthesis of
   defined nanostructures. Complimentary click chemistry employing
   dendrimers with 1, 2, 3, or 4 ring-strained cyclooctyne ligands and
   dendrimers with 1 azide ligand were utilized to prepare megamer
   structures containing two to five 30 000 kDa monomer units as
   characterized by mass spectrometry, size exclusion chromatography, and
   reverse-phase liquid chromatography. The resulting structures are
   flexible with masses ranging from 60 000 to 150 000 kDa, and are soluble
   in water, methanol, and dimethylsulfoxide.}},

Title = {{Integrated Framework for Estimating, Benchmarking, and Monitoring
   Pollutant Emissions of Construction Operations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{12}},
Abstract = {{Construction operations are highly energy-intensive and account for
   significant environmental impacts, including greenhouse gases (GHG) and
   other engine exhaust associated with material procurement/delivery and
   on-site construction activities. The opportunities for mitigating air
   pollutant emissions from construction operations can be captured by
   estimating and benchmarking during the preconstruction phase and then
   monitoring during the construction phase. However, a formal process
   model to manage the environmental aspects of on-site construction
   activities has yet to be clearly delineated, although recently several
   research efforts have appeared in relevant areas such as the development
   of in-use emission factors of construction equipment, methods for
   reliably estimating emissions at the project level, embodied carbon
   footprint benchmarking methods, and practical monitoring tools. Such a
   lack of a formal process model causes the misinterpretation of the
   benefits from recent research efforts in each area and hinders their
   implementation in practice. In this context, this paper aims to
   establish a framework model that could be a systematic and generic
   reference to the management of pollutant emissions from construction
   operations with state-of-the-art methods and tools. To do so, the paper
   identifies a generic process to be supported by research efforts in each
   area and presents an integrated framework based on the analysis of data
   connectivity between processes. An example of the indirect emission
   measurement is presented to demonstrate how data connectivity can be
   ensured between processes within the framework. (C) 2013 American

Title = {{Life-Cycle Assessment of Concrete Dam Construction: Comparison of
   Environmental Impact of Rock-Filled and Conventional Concrete}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{12}},
Abstract = {{Massive concrete dam projects will be constructed in the next 10years to
   respond to the increasing demand for clean energy and water resources in
   developing countries. Because of their ample use of cement, these
   projects have a significant environmental impact, including the
   production of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Rock-filled concrete (RFC)
   is an innovative dam construction method that promises better
   environmental performance than conventional concrete (CC) in the
   material production stage by saving a large amount of cement. However,
   the environmental loads throughout the entire life cycle of a dam must
   be quantified. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate the environmental loads
   in the lifetime of a dam and reveal the environmental impact of RFC
   relative to CC over the entire life cycle of a concrete dam. Through
   reviewing the limitations of the existing life-cycle assessment (LCA)
   models, a hybrid LCA model is applied to achieve this goal. The results
   from a case study of a concrete dam project in China are presented to
   demonstrate the environmental benefit of RFC throughout the lifetime of
   a dam. The results indicate that RFC reduces greenhouse gas emissions by
   approximately 64\% and energy consumption by approximately 55\% compared
   with CC. With regard to each life cycle stage, RFC decreased the CO2
   emissions by 72\% in material production, 25\% in transportation, 51\%
   in construction, and 15.6\% in operation and maintenance. The conclusion
   is that RFC is more environmentally responsible throughout the life
   cycle of a dam's, and that the environmental benefit of RFC may help to
   encourage decision makers to select the appropriate methods in the
   planning phase. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{15022-15030}},
Abstract = {{Surfactant-free Co3O4 nanostructures with various particle size ranges
   were synthesized via the solution combustion method using cobalt nitrate
   solution as a cobalt precursor and urea as a combustion fuel. Control
   over average particles size range was achieved by tuning the reaction
   ignition temperature between 300 degrees C and 800 degrees C. X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and helium gas pycnometry indicated the formation of
   single phase Co3O4 nanoparticles with a spinel structure. Transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) studies revealed an increase of the size range
   from 5-8 nm to 200-400 nm for Co3O4 nanoparticles synthesized at 300
   degrees C and 800 degrees C, respectively. The corresponding decrease in
   the specific surface area from 39 m(2) g(-1) to similar to 2 m(2) g(-1)
   was confirmed by gas adsorption analysis using BET techniques. Magnetic
   susceptibility measurements revealed a dominant antiferromagnetic (AFM)
   ordering and the Neel temperature decreases with a decreasing average
   particle size range from 31 K (200-400 nm) to 25 K (5-18 nm).
   Interestingly, effective magnetic moments (ranging from 4.12 mu(B) to
   6.16 mu(B)) substantially larger than the value of 3.9 mu(B) expected
   for Co2+ ions in the normal spinel structure of Co3O4 were extracted
   from the inverse susceptibility data. This finding was rationalized by
   taking into account the disordered distribution of Co2+ and Co3+ ions in
   the Co3O4 inverse spinel structures
   ({[}(Co2+)(1-x)(Co3+)(x)](tet){[}(Co2+)(x)(Co3+)(2-x)]O-oct(4)) where
   the inversion degree (x) depends on the synthesis temperature. Transport
   measurements using hot pressed pellets of Co3O4 nanoparticles indicated
   p-type semiconducting behavior and drastic reductions in the thermal
   conductivity with decreasing average particle size.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen storage is the crucially missing link to a future hydrogen
   economy. There have been intense efforts in developing nanostructured
   adsorbent materials for hydrogen storage during the last decade. Storage
   at ambient temperature is particularly desirable. New approaches include
   boron-and nitrogensubstituted carbons, metal-organic frameworks, and, in
   particular, metal-assisted storage. The metalassisted approach, which
   exploits the well-documented hydrogen spillover phenomenon, has shown
   considerable promise. This review provides insights and understanding of
   hydrogen storage on the new adsorbent materials and offers possible
   future directions for further developments. Keys to accuracy and
   reproducibility in high-pressure hydrogen uptake measurements are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A computational electrohydrodynamic (EHD) model is presented for the 3D
   electrically induced fluid motion and free surface morphology evolution
   during EHD patterning transfer of micro/nanostructures. The model
   entails a finite difference solution of the electric field equation with
   a leaky dielectric model to account for polymer behaviour, the
   Navier-Stokes equations for electrically driven flows and the phase
   field equation for the free surface deformation. These equations are
   fully coupled and represent a very large complex numerical system. Once
   discretized, the intensive computation is alleviated with the use of
   parallel computing algorithms. Computed results are presented that
   illustrate the transient development of 3D micro/nano-structures under
   an electric field. Two classical templates are considered in this study,
   for both of which the polymeric structures conform well to the template,
   resulting in the micro/nano-patterning transfer from the template to
   polymer film. The model is a useful tool to explore optimal conditions
   for scalable manufacturing of large scale nanostructures using the EHD
   patterning processes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a method called local hub screening for
   detecting hubs in a sparse correlation or partial correlation network
   over p nodes. The proposed method is related to hub screening(1) where a
   Poisson-type limit is used to specify p-values on the number of spurious
   hub nodes found in the network. In this paper we also establish Poisson
   limits. However, instead of being on the global number of hub nodes
   found, here the Poisson limit applies to the node degree found at an
   individual node. This allows us to define asymptotic p-values that are
   local to each node. We will see that the convergence rates for proposed
   local hub screening method are at least a factor of p faster than those
   of global correlation and hub screening.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous reagent solution micro-domains with sharp boundaries and defined
   shapes are created over cell monolayers within an immiscible bulk
   aqueous phase through rehydration of freestanding and portable dried
   reagent patches of the corresponding shape. This is in contrast to
   typical dissolution of reagent tablets or lyophilized biopolymer patches
   in aqueous solutions where no discernible reagent solution patterns are
   formed upon their full hydration. The key to enable the engineering of
   such stable reagent solution micro-domains is to formulate the reagent
   patches with polymers that form an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) upon
   hydration by the bulk aqueous phase. This paper demonstrates this
   concept using dried reagent patches that incorporate dextran (DEX) and a
   bulk aqueous phase comprised of cell culture medium containing
   poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG). For reagents that prefer to partition in
   the DEX phase of the resulting ATPS, this procedure results in
   micro-patterned localization of reagent solution only to regions of the
   cell monolayer covered with the rehydrated DEX patch. The types of
   aqueous reagent solution micro-domain shapes that can be formed by the
   rehydration of such freestanding DEX-reagent patches are surprisingly
   broad and can be readily controlled by use of different templates for
   dehydrating the DEX solutions or even by cutting flat patches. The
   utility of the method is demonstrated through localized delivery of
   fluorescent molecules and enzymes for cell detachment. The patterned
   enzymatic detachment of cells enables convenient wound healing assays
   where cell monolayers can be wounded in different shapes dictated by the
   silhouette of the original DEX-reagent patches.}},

Abstract = {{A physics-based side-reaction coupled electrochemical model for capacity
   fade of a graphite/LiMn2O4 cell is developed by including the key
   degradation mechanisms in both anode and cathode. The side reactions
   considered in this study include 1) solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)
   growth and manganese deposition on the anode and 2) manganese
   dissolution, electrolyte oxidation and salt decomposition on the
   cathode. Our study reveals three stages of capacity fade upon long term
   cycling: acceleration, stabilization, and saturation. In the
   acceleration stage, capacity fade is due mainly to the cyclable lithium
   loss induced by the anode SEI growth. In the stabilization stage, the
   anode SET growth slows down as it gets thicker, the cathode Mn
   dissolution-induced capacity loss outpaces cyclable lithium loss, and
   the cathode becomes more intercalated at the end of discharge. In the
   saturation stage, cathode capacity degrades further and becomes the
   limiting factor, the cyclable lithium is shifted to the anode and the
   cathode reaches end-of-discharge saturation due to the severe cathode
   capacity fade. This study shows that the cyclable lithium loss and the
   cathode capacity loss are the two major contributors to the cell
   capacity fade, and the interaction between them determines the cell
   capacity. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Air Force has recently built a vacuum chamber for simulating LEO and
   GEO space environments for testing small satellites or satellite
   subsystems. Four natural environmental sources are provided: broadband
   solar flux, and narrow-band electron, proton, and atomic oxygen fluxes;
   together with spacecraft charging; outgassing and attitude control Xe
   ion simulators. Although the chamber has diagnostic sensors to measure
   the fluxes from the sources at one plane, uncertainties remain about the
   details of the source emissions, their interactions, and impacts on the
   chamber. To help address these uncertainties models of the sources are
   being developed. We have modeled the Atomic Oxygen source and present
   results of our recent computer simulations. We motivate our choice of
   the dynamical DSMC code used, and present results such as the AO fluence
   time history and its spatial distribution over the test article; chamber
   pressure time history; flow velocity contours; the importance of
   particle-particle collisions; and attempts to model the motion of
   residual source-produced O+ ions in the geomagnetic field. We compare
   with existing measurements.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2342}},
Pages = {{76-82}},
Abstract = {{Water is one of the major factors that contribute to the deformation and
   deterioration of concrete structures. The top surface of structures such
   as slabs or pavements on the ground can be subject to external drying,
   and the bottom surface can be in contact with water from ineffective
   drainage. A knowledge of moisture distribution significantly improves
   durability prediction. The water-to-cement ratio, the environment
   relative humidity (RH), and the moisture transport properties of
   concrete affect moisture distribution in slabs. This study investigated
   the effects of surface drying, self-desiccation, and bottom water
   absorption on moisture profiles in concrete slabs at water-to-cement
   ratios of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. The RH distributions along slab depths were
   measured continuously from final set with specially designed RH sensors.
   The hydraulic diffusivity of concretes was obtained through sorptivity
   testing. An analytical procedure that considered external drying,
   self-desiccation, and water absorption was implemented for RH simulation
   of slabs exposed to different environmental conditions. Experimental
   measurements and simulations showed that the influential depth is about
   50 to 100 mm from the external surface drying. The influential depth
   from water absorption is about 50 mm. An equivalent temperature gradient
   (Delta T-e) can be used to quantify the moisture gradient effect. Given
   that the environmental conditions are the same, the analytical
   simulation suggests that greater Delta T-e results in a concrete slab
   with a higher water-to-cement ratio.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a practical design and integration of multidirectional
   tilted UV lithography and microinjection molding for microstructure-
   based microfluidic devices. The previously reported undercut (or
   T-profile) problem of photoresist causes the imperfect mirror image
   duplication of the microstructures to the Ni mold. This issue inevitably
   leads to the unstable molds in the production of microstructure- based
   microfluidic devices. This study presents a simple route for the
   successful fabrication of microstructure- based microfluidic devices by
   multidirectional tilted UV lithography. By changing slope angles of
   microstructures through tilting the chuck during the UV exposure, the
   slope angles (up to 30 degrees) around the microstructures allow the
   effective prevention of the undercut problems of photoresist and
   facilitate easy releasing of the device with high durability. This
   technique can be easily used for the production of the
   microstructure-based microfluidic devices in microanalysis and
   lab-on-chip applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a half-duplex decode-and-forward multi-hop
   relay network. The model for the channel that we consider includes path
   loss, shadowing, and fast fading. For this system and channel model, we
   find the outage probability for the multi-hop relay communication
   strategy that allows a packet to follow any path through the relays in
   the network. Based on the outage probability and the rate that used in
   the network, we find the exact throughput of the system. From this
   understanding of the system throughput, we find the optimal operating
   rate and the optimal number of hops that maximize the throughput. We
   also consider a system in which the relays have buffers that allow them
   to delay transmission and transmit when the channel conditions are
   favorable. We compare the system throughput of this buffer-equipped
   multi-hop relay network with the conventional multi-hop relay network
   without buffers.}},

Abstract = {{We introduced haptic cues to the serial reaction time (SRT) task
   alongside the standard visual cues to explore the relative contributions
   of haptic and visual cues to motor memory and perceptual memory. Motor
   learning is a complex process that likely depends on the availability of
   haptic sensory feedback. Motor learning is also often an implicit
   process, wherein the learner is not even aware that learning is taking
   place. The SRT task was devised to study implicit learning. Reaction
   times (RTs) are reduced with practice even in the absence of explicit
   learning about a sequence embedded in a train of cues. We adopted an SRT
   protocol developed by Willingham in 1999 to determine whether haptic
   cues contribute differently than visual cues to the balance of motor and
   perceptual learning.
   Experimental results involving 32 participants showed that sequence
   learning occurs implicitly with haptic stimuli to much the same extent
   as visual stimuli. Also, it was revealed that the dependence on motor
   memory (as opposed to perceptual memory) was greater in the group
   responding to haptic cues than the group responding to visual cues.
   Comparing the dependence on motor versus perceptual memory, the haptic
   group reached marginal significance (p=.09), whereas the visual group
   difference was not significant (p=.23).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, experimental results are reported to study the influence
   of high-temperature aging on the thermo-mechanical behavior of a
   commercially-available, thermo-responsive shape memory polymer (SMP),
   Veriflex-E(TM) (glass transition temperature, T-g = 90-105 degrees C).
   To achieve a shape memory effect in high T-g SMPs such as this, high
   temperature cycles are required that can result in macromolecular
   scission and/or crosslinking, which we term thermo-mechanical aging (or
   chemo-rheological degradation). This process results in mechanical
   property changes and possible permanent set of the material that can
   limit the useful life of SMPs in practice. We compare experimental
   results of shape memory recovery with and without aging. Similar to the
   approach originated by Tobolsky in the 1950's, a combination of uniaxial
   constant stress and intermittent stretch experiments are also used in
   high temperature creep-recovery experiments to deduce the kinetcis of
   scission of the original macromolecular network and the generation of
   newly formed networks having different reference configurations. The
   macroscopic effects of thermo-mechanical aging, in terms of the
   evolution of residual strains and change in elastic response, are
   quantified.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal shape memory effect in polymeric materials referes to the
   ability of a sample to retain a deformed shape when cooled below T-g,
   and then recover its initial shape when subsequently heated. Although
   these properties are thought to be related to temperature-dependent
   changes in network structure and polymer chain mobility, a consistent
   picture of the molecular mechanisms which determine shape memory
   behavior does not exist. This, along with large differences in the shape
   memory cycling response for different materials, has made model
   development and specific property optimization difficult. In this work
   we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the thermal
   shape memory effect to inform micro-macro relationships and
   systematically identify the salient features leading to desirable shape
   behavior. We consider a simulation test set including chains with
   increasing levels of the microscopic restrictions on chain motion (the
   freely-jointed, freely-rotating, and rotational isomeric state chain
   models), each simulated with both the NPT and NVT ensembles. It is found
   that the NPT ensemble with attractive interactions between monomers
   enabled is the most appropriate for simulating the temperature-dependent
   mechanical behavior of a polymer using coarse-grained MD. Of the
   different models, the freely-jointed chain system shows the most
   desirable shape memory characteristics; this behavior is attributed to
   the ability of the particles in this system to pack closely together in
   an energetically favorable con figuration. A comparison with
   experimental data demonstrates that the coarse-grained simulations
   display all of the relevant trends in mechanical behavior during
   constant strain shape memory cycling. We conclude that atomistic detail
   is not needed to represent a shape memory polymer, and that multi-scale
   modeling techniques may build on the mechanisms embodied in the simple
   coarse-grained model.}},

Abstract = {{The multifunctional hybrid composite structure studied here consists of
   a ceramic outer layer capable of withstanding high temperatures, a
   functionally graded ceramic layer combining shape memory alloy (SMA)
   properties of NiTi together with Ti2AlC (called Graded Ceramic/Metal
   Composite, or GCMeC), and a high temperature sensor patch, followed by a
   polymer matrix composite laced with vascular cooling channels all held
   together with various epoxies. Due to the recoverable nature of SMA and
   adhesive properties of Ti2AlC, the damping behavior of the GCMeC is
   largely viscoelastic. This paper presents a finite element formulation
   for this multifunctional hybrid structure with embedded viscoelastic
   material. In order to implement the viscoelastic model into the finite
   element formulation, a second order three parameter
   Golla-Hughes-McTavish (GHM) method is used to describe the viscoelastic
   behavior. Considering the parameter identification, a strategy to
   estimate the fractional order of the time derivative and the relaxation
   time is outlined. The curve-fitting aspects of both GHM and ADF show
   good agreement with experimental data obtained from dynamic mechanics
   analysis. The performance of the finite element of the layered
   multifunctional beam is verified through experimental model analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of T cell epitopes is a critical, but often difficult
   step in studying T cell function and developing peptide-based vaccines
   and immunotherapies. Unlike antibodies that recognize free soluble
   antigens, T cell receptor (TCR) recognizes its epitope bound to major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) expressed on antigen presenting cells
   (APCs). In addition, the examination of T cell epitope activity requires
   the use of professional APCs, which are difficult to isolate, expand,
   and maintain. To address these issues, we have developed a facile,
   accurate, and high-throughput method for T cell epitope mapping by
   screening antigen-derived peptide libraries in complex with MHC protein
   displayed on yeast cell surface. Here, we use hemagglutinin and
   influenza A virus X31/A/Aichi/68 as examples to describe the key steps
   in identification of CD4(+) T cell epitopes from a single antigenic
   protein and the entire genome of a pathogen, respectively. Methods for

Abstract = {{Monitoring wide-field surrounding information is essential for
   vision-based autonomous navigation in micro-air-vehicles (MAV). Our
   image-cube (iCube) module, which consists of multiple sensors that are
   facing different angles in 3-D space, can be applied to the wide-field
   of view optic flows estimation (mu-Compound eyes) and to attitude
   control (mu-Ocelli) in the Micro Autonomous Systems and Technology
   (MAST) platforms. In this paper, we report an analog/digital (A/D)
   mixed-mode optic-flow sensor, which generates both optic flows and
   normal images in different modes for mu-Compound eyes and mu-Ocelli
   applications. The sensor employs a time-stamp based optic flow algorithm
   which is modified from the conventional EMD (Elementary Motion Detector)
   algorithm to give an optimum partitioning of hardware blocks in analog
   and digital domains as well as adequate allocation of pixel-level,
   column-parallel, and chip-level signal processing. Temporal filtering,
   which may require huge hardware resources if implemented in digital
   domain, is remained in a pixel-level analog processing unit. The rest of
   the blocks, including feature detection and time-stamp latching, are
   implemented using digital circuits in a column-parallel processing unit.
   Finally, time-stamp information is decoded into velocity from look-up
   tables, multiplications, and simple subtraction circuits in a chip-level
   processing unit, thus significantly reducing core digital processing
   power consumption. In the normal image mode, the sensor generates 8-b
   digital images using single slope ADCs in the column unit. In the optic
   flow mode, the sensor estimates 8-b 1-D optic flows from the integrated
   mixed-mode algorithm core and 2-D optic flows with an external
   time-stamp processing, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The adaptive multifunctional composite structure studied here is to
   address two issues remaining in lightweight structural composites
   required by many engineering applications. The first is to add
   additional functionality to multifunctional composites and the second is
   to provide adaptive damping in structures that cover a wide range of
   frequencies and temperatures. Because of its potential for practical
   payoffs, passive structural damping can find wide application through
   the use of high-damping viscoelastic polymers or elastomers. However,
   all passive damping using these damping materials suffer from failing at
   certain temperatures and in certain frequency ranges. The extreme
   environments often seen by engineering systems provide high temperature,
   which is exactly where damping levels in structures reduce causing
   unacceptable vibrations. In addition, as loading frequencies reduce
   damping levels also fall off, and many loads experienced by large
   structures are low frequency. The proposed research addresses increasing
   the range of effectiveness of damping by addressing the temperature and
   frequency dependence of material damping by using a multifunctional
   composite system containing an active element. Previous research has
   yielded a finite element model of linear viscoelastic material and
   structural behavior that captures characteristic frequency-dependent
   behavior, continuing research has addressed the accommodation of
   temperature dependence, and the examination of the new concept of
   `electronic damping' or `e-damping'. The resulting modeling approach is
   validated through experimental validation.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensors have emerged to offer low-cost sensors with impressive
   functionality (e. g., data acquisition, computing, and communication)
   and modular installations. Such advantages enable higher nodal densities
   than tethered systems resulting in increased spatial resolution of the
   monitoring system. However, high nodal density comes at a cost as huge
   amounts of data are generated, weighing heavy on power sources,
   transmission bandwidth, and data management requirements, often making
   data compression necessary. The traditional compression paradigm
   consists of high rate (>Nyquist) uniform sampling and storage of the
   entire target signal followed by some desired compression scheme prior
   to transmission. The recently proposed compressed sensing (CS) framework
   combines the acquisition and compression stage together, thus removing
   the need for storage and operation of the full target signal prior to
   transmission. The effectiveness of the CS approach hinges on the
   presence of a sparse representation of the target signal in a known
   basis, similarly exploited by several traditional compressive sensing
   applications today (e. g., imaging, MRI). Field implementations of CS
   schemes in wireless SHM systems have been challenging due to the lack of
   commercially available sensing units capable of sampling methods (e. g.,
   random) consistent with the compressed sensing framework, often moving
   evaluation of CS techniques to simulation and post-processing. The
   research presented here describes implementation of a CS sampling scheme
   to the Narada wireless sensing node and the energy efficiencies observed
   in the deployed sensors. Of interest in this study is the
   compressibility of acceleration response signals collected from a
   multi-girder steel-concrete composite bridge. The study shows the
   benefit of CS in reducing data requirements while ensuring data analysis
   on compressed data remain accurate.}},

Abstract = {{Structural Health Monitoring of large-scale bridges requires collection,
   storage and processing of large amounts of data, and must provide
   distributed concurrent access. In this paper we report on the progress
   of the design and implementation of a cyber-infrastructure system that
   is currently being field-tested on a long-span bridge in California and
   a short-span bridge in Michigan. This system provides remote access for
   sensor data acquisition systems, data analysis modules, and human
   operators. The implementation is based on an object-oriented data model
   description and makes extensive use of code generation to allow for the
   rapid development and continued improvement of the system. Currently the
   system provides storage of raw and processed sensor data, finite element
   models, traffic data, links to PONTIS data, reliability modeling data,
   and model-based analysis results. Apart from the ubiquitous read/write
   access, the system also includes an event system that allows data
   consumers to be triggered by the arrival of new data. In addition to
   essential backup/restore facilities, the system also includes
   import/export tools that can migrate data between versions, which is
   very useful in keeping pace with the continuous improvements that are
   being made in the design and implementation of the cyber-infrastructure
   system. The system also provides introspection, as the data model is
   made available by means of an inspector client interface, which allows
   the development of generic client tools that can dynamically discover
   the data model, and present a corresponding interface to the user.
   Currently available user-interfaces include an editor GUI application,
   and a read-only web application.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposed a set of representative real-world driving cycles in
   Midwestern US, which are capable of capturing the dependence of driving
   patterns on driving distance. Recent analyses of the real-world driving
   in USA show that most of certification cycles lead to underestimation of
   energy consumption per mile compared to the naturalistic driving
   patterns. Real-world driving is a mix of local driving and highway
   driving. Furthermore, the driving patterns show high dependency on the
   driving distance. To cover the wide range of real-world driving
   distances, five synthetic cycles are generated ranging from 4.78 miles
   to 40.71 miles following the real-world driving distance distribution.
   Each individual cycle is constructed by a stochastic process using the
   extracted driving information from the naturalistic trip data in the
   Midwestern US. While constructing the cycle set, the statistical
   criteria for validating the cycle representativeness are processed to
   capture the clear distance dependency and remove random variations. The
   synthesized cycles are subsequently used for Plug-in Hybrid Electric
   Vehicle (PHEVs) or Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEVs) design and control
   studies for the assessment of the impact of electrified vehicles on the
   grid.}},

Abstract = {{Although the battery surface temperature is commonly measured, the core
   temperature of a cell may be much higher hence more critical than the
   surface temperature. The core temperature of a battery, though usually
   unmeasured in commercial applications, can be estimated by an observer,
   based on a lumped-parameter battery thermal model and the measurement of
   the current and the surface temperature. Even with a closed loop
   observer based on the measured surface temperature, the accuracy of the
   core temperature estimation depends on the model parameters. For such
   purpose, an online parameterization methodology and an adaptive observer
   are designed for a cylindrical battery. The single cell thermal model is
   then scaled up to create a battery cluster model to investigate the
   temperature pattern of the cluster The modeled thermal interconnections
   between cells include cell to cell heat conduction and convection to the
   surrounding coolant flow. An observability analysis is performed on the
   cluster before designing a closed loop observer for the pack. Based on
   the analysis, guidelines for determining the minimum number of required
   sensors and their exact locations are derived that guarantee the
   observability of all temperature states.}},

Title = {{Simple multi-level microchannel fabrication by pseudo-grayscale backside
   diffused light lithography}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{42}},
Pages = {{19467-19473}},
Abstract = {{Photolithography of multi-level channel features in microfluidics is
   laborious and/or costly. Grayscale photolithography is mostly used with
   positive photoresists and conventional front side exposure, but the
   grayscale masks needed are generally costly and positive photoresists
   are not commonly used in microfluidic rapid prototyping. Here we
   introduce a simple and inexpensive alternative that uses
   pseudo-grayscale (pGS) photomasks in combination with backside diffused
   light lithography (BDLL) and the commonly used negative photoresist,
   SU-8. BDLL can produce smooth multi-level channels of gradually changing
   heights without use of true grayscale masks because of the use of
   diffused light. Since the exposure is done through a glass slide, the
   photoresist is cross-linked from the substrate side up enabling
   well-defined and stable structures to be fabricated from even unspun
   photoresist layers. In addition to providing unique structures and
   capabilities, the method is compatible with the ``garage
   microfluidics{''} concept of creating useful tools at low cost since pGS
   BDLL can be performed with the use of only hot plates and a UV
   transilluminator: equipment commonly found in biology labs. Expensive
   spin coaters or collimated UV aligners are not needed. To demonstrate
   the applicability of pGS BDLL, a variety of weir-type cell traps were
   constructed with a single UV exposure to separate cancer cells
   (MDA-MB-231, 10-15 mu m in size) from red blood cells (RBCs, 2-8 mu m in
   size) as well as follicle clusters (40-50 mu m in size) from cancer
   cells (MDA-MB-231, 10-15 mu m in size).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and implementation of a high density 150
   V-200 V to 28 V, 200 W-400 W resonant dc-dc converter with embedded

   air-core toroidal inductors fabricated with printed circuit board (PCB)
   technology. Implementing the inductors with the PCB eliminates
   inductance variation, minimizes unwanted stray magnetic fields and
   parasitics, and reduces undesired coupling to the rest of the circuit.
   Hence, the tuning and implementation of the converter are simplified
   while achieving high levels of performance and power density. By not
   using magnetic cores, the inductors also maintain stable values over a
   wide temperature range. Moreover, the paper discusses the trade-offs
   between simplicity and performance of implementing a hard-switched gate
   drive at MHz switching frequencies. We describe the advantages of
   resonant power converter topologies in applications requiring high
   density and high performance in demanding environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The Viterbi algorithm is widely used to decode convolutional codes. We
   present an unconventional approach to Viterbi decoder design based on
   stochastic computing (SC) which represents data by random bit-streams
   that can be interpreted as probabilities. Stochastic circuits allow many
   decoding functions to be implemented by simple hardware; e.g., multi-bit
   multiplication can be realized by an AND gate. SC is also highly
   error-tolerant since a soft error (bit-flip) has little impact on a SC
   number's value. It also allows decoding precision to be traded for
   decoding speed. We design two SC-based Viterbi decoders and also a
   hybrid binary-SC design; the latter uses SC for arithmetic calculations,
   but not for storing numbers. The proposed designs are compared with a
   binary (non-SC) decoder using a standard (7,1/2) convolutional code. The
   SC designs are found to be more tolerant of soft errors in the decoder
   than the binary design, and more capable of supporting some useful
   trade-offs among area cost, data rate, precision, and bit-error rate.}},

Abstract = {{High frequency (HF) radar has become an important tool for remotely
   mapping the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of waves and
   currents of the nearshore coastal ocean. Its acceptance along ocean
   coasts has resulted in the development of several commercially available
   systems and a planned nationwide coastal network to routinely measure
   coastal currents. Because HF radiation is known to propagate less
   efficiently over fresh water than seawater, it has been largely
   overlooked as a viable tool for freshwater application. However, its
   potential utility in freshwater was clearly demonstrated by a deployment
   along Lake Michigan as part of the 1999-2001 Episodic Events Great Lakes
   Experiment. As part of this experiment, the University of Michigan
   Multi-frequency Coastal Radar consistently produced reliable near
   surface current measurements to a range of approximately 25 km offshore
   showing strong correlation with both in-situ measurements and numerical
   hind-casts. This paper provides background on HF radar technology, a
   summary of the current state of the art with respect to freshwater and
   describes the results of a recent experiment to measure the propagation
   of HF radar signal over freshwater using CODAR Ocean Sensors SeaSondes,
   operating at 5 and 42 MHz with 21 W and 90 W average radiated powers,
   respectively. The effective offshore range for these radars was found to
   be 18 km at 5 MHz and 4-5 km at 42 MHz. These findings are consistent
   with currently available models for the prediction of propagation loss,
   verifying that they can reliably be used to estimate ranges in
   freshwater settings. (C) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes

Abstract = {{A surrogate modeling framework is implemented to analyze the performance

   modeled, and ranges for all material properties are selected based on
   reported data from the literature. The relative impact of the variables
   is quantified using global sensitivity analysis, and critical
   diffusivity and conductivity values are calculated. Two dimensionless
   parameters based on relative time and conductivity scales are defined
   and found to separate operating conditions into distinct regimes in
   which the cell performance is limited by diffusion or conduction.
   Combining the two dimensionless parameters into a single quantity and
   non-dimensionalizing the energy performance yields a Pareto-efficient
   set of solutions that are described well by the generalized logistic

Abstract = {{The expansion of battery material during lithium intercalation is a
   concern for the cycle life and performance of lithium ion batteries. In
   this paper, electrode expansion is quantified from in situ neutron
   images taken during cycling of pouch cells with lithium iron phosphate
   positive and graphite negative electrodes. Apart from confirming the
   overall expansion as a function of state of charge and the correlation
   with graphite transitions that have been observed in previous
   dilatometer experiments we show the spatial distribution of the
   expansion along the individual electrodes of the pouch cell. The
   experiments were performed on two cells with different electrode areas
   during low and high c-rate operation. The measurements show how charging
   straightened the cell layers that were slightly curved by handling of
   the pouch cell during setup of the experiment. Subsequent high charging
   rate, that exceeded the suggested operating voltage limits, was shown to
   have a strong influence on the observed expansion. Specifically, during
   high-rate cycling, the battery showed a much larger and irreversible
   expansion of around 1.5\% which was correlated with a 4\% loss in
   capacity over 21 cycles. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical framework for automating the design of
   lithium-ion cells to maximize cell energy density while meeting specific

   simulated using a physics-based electrochemistry model. The design is

   gradient-based optimization by applying this framework to optimize the
   design of a lithium-ion cell with spinel manganese dioxide cathode and
   meso-carbon micro beads (MCMB) anode for a range of power requirements.
   Results indicate that variations in the electrode thickness and porosity
   at optimal cell designs can be quantified via active mass ratios and it
   is found that the active mass ratios for optimal cell designs are

Abstract = {{The concept of band structure engineering near the Fermi level through
   atomic-scale alteration of a bulk semiconductor crystal structure using
   coherently embedded intrinsic semiconducting quantum dots provides a
   unique opportunity to manipulate the transport behavior of the existing
   ensembles of carriers within the semiconducting matrix. Here we show
   that in situ growth of coherent nanometer-scale full-Heusler quantum
   dots (fH-QDs) within the p-type Ti0.5Hf0.5CoSb0.9Sn0.1 half-Heusler (hH)
   matrix induces a drastic decrease of the effective hole density within
   the hH/fH-QD nanocomposites at 300 K followed by a sharp increase with
   rising temperature. This behavior is associated with the formation of
   staggered heterojunctions with a valence band (VB) offset energy, Delta
   E at the hH/fH phase boundaries. The energy barrier (Delta E)
   discriminates existing holes with respect to their energy by trapping
   low energy (LE) holes, while promoting the transport of high energy (HE)
   holes through the VB of the fH-QDs. This ``hole culling{''} results in
   surprisingly large increases in the mobility and the effective mass of
   HE holes contributing to electronic conduction. The simultaneous
   reduction in the density and the increase in the effective mass of holes
   resulted in large enhancements of the thermopower whereas; the increase
   in the mobility minimizes the drop in the electrical conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids can bring electricity power to rural communities or isolated
   military forward operation bases. For many rural areas, renewable powers
   could be the cheapest power sources available. Utilizing renewable power
   sources and energy storage systems such as batteries requires new power
   and voltage control strategies. In addition, these microgrids may be
   reconfigured frequently. Therefore, the control strategies must be
   implemented in a plug-and-play fashion at individual nodes, and ideally
   they should not require much communication with neighboring nodes.
   Another issue of microgrids is the resistance loss in distribution lines
   due to the lower operating voltage. To reduce power losses, voltage
   control is required which again must work in a plug-and-play fashion. In
   this paper, we propose a decentralized real-time voltage control
   algorithm that minimizes power losses for a micro grid supported by
   inverter based distributed power sources. Its optimality and
   plug-and-play nature are demonstrated through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, for the first time, an equivalent circuit electrical
   model is integrated with a two-state thermal model to form an
   electro-thermal model for cylindrical lithium ion batteries. The
   parameterization of such model for an A123 26650 LiFePO4 cylindrical
   battery is presented. The resistances and capacitances of the equivalent
   circuit model are identified at different temperatures and states of
   charge (SOC), for charging and discharging. Functions are chosen to
   characterize the fitted parameters. A two-state thermal model is used to
   approximate the core and surface temperatures of the battery. The
   electrical model is coupled with the thermal model through heat
   generation and the thermal states are in turn feeding a radially
   averaged cell temperature affecting the parameters of the electrical
   model. Parameters of the thermal model are identified using a least
   squares algorithm. The electro-thermal model is then validated against
   voltage and surface temperature measurements from a realistic drive
   cycle experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, it is difficult to determine when a novice bicycle rider is
   ready to ride without training wheels or external assistance. In this
   study, we quantify the changes that occurred as 10 subjects with
   disabilities learned to ride traditional bicycles during a specialized
   bicycle training camp. These changes are revealed by three synchronized
   wireless inertial measurement units (IMUS) used to measure bicycle
   kinematics. Out of 10 subjects, 6 were successful in riding a
   traditional bicycle without assistance by the end of the camp. The peak
   value of the cross-correlation between steer and roll angular velocities
   was significantly greater for riders who ultimately succeeded in riding
   a traditional bike without assistance. This finding suggests that rider
   learning can be quantified by increased correlation between bicycle
   steer rate and roll rate. In essence, learning to steer in the direction
   of lean is an essential skill in learning to ride a bicycle.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an efficient method for scheduling an
   energy-consuming sensor sparingly in combination with an on-off
   controller, specifically for a finite horizon control problem in which
   only end states are critical. In certain low-power applications, such as
   autonomous micro-robotics, on-off controllers can be very efficient in
   operating piezoelectric actuators (and other capacitive actuation
   schemes) compared to traditional analog and PWM controllers. However,
   with existing sensing circuitry, sensing at the same frequency as
   control can be prohibitively expensive. Instead, a method is presented
   for best scheduling a limited number of sensor measurements and updates
   to control inputs during a finite horizon on-off control problem, in
   response to Gaussian disturbances and measurement noise. To simplify the
   problem, a lower bound for the expected value of a quadratic error
   function of the end states is found, which permits rapid evaluation of
   candidate sensor times.}},

Abstract = {{Recent interest in bistable devices for vibration energy harvesting has
   given evidence of their beneficial performance in realistic stochastic
   or low frequency excitation environments since the snap through effect
   (high displacement switching from one stable state to another) is a
   non-resonant dynamic. It has yet to be rigorously determined how adding
   additional degrees-of-freedom may influence bistable energy harvesting
   response since the nonlinearities do not allow for a direct analogy from
   multi-body linear examples. We analytically and experimentally assess
   the potential for improving energy harvesting dynamics by adding a
   conventional linear oscillator to a bistable energy harvester. The
   traditional coupling parameters of mass ratio and tuning ratio are
   evaluated as means to tune the harvester's response. Advantageous design
   regimes are classified and explanations for the rich dynamics are
   provided. Experiments confirm the benefit of appending a linear
   oscillator to the bistable system as a simple means by which to enhance
   harvesting performance.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, an adaptive structure concept based on fluidic flexible matrix
   composite ((FMC)-M-2) cells has been investigated for its potential to
   provide multiple functionalities simultaneously. This structure consists
   of different (FMC)-M-2 cells that are connected through internal fluidic
   circuit, and due to the interaction between the fluid flow and cell wall
   deformation, the structure exhibits distinct system poles and zeros. By
   adjusting the (FMC)-M-2 cellular design parameters, the poles and zeros
   can be placed at appropriate positions so that the cellular structure
   can perform dynamic functions such as vibration absorption and dynamic
   actuation. In order to fully explore the potential of the (FMC)-M-2
   based cellular structure, this research develops a synthesis procedure
   for a triple cellular structure based on a set of prescribed poles and
   zeros. This procedure is essentially a hybrid numerical method combining
   the Jacobi inverse eigenvalue problem solver and genetic algorithm with
   discrete variables. It is capable of selecting physically feasible
   design parameters for each (FMC)-M-2 cell in order to achieve the
   desired pole and zero positions accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft wings with smooth, hinge-less morphing ailerons exhibit
   increased chordwise aerodynamic efficiency over conventional hinged
   ailerons. Ideally, the wing would also use these morphing ailerons to
   smoothly vary its airfoil shape between spanwise stations to optimize
   the lift distribution and further increase aerodynamic efficiency.
   However, the mechanical complexity or added weight of achieving such a
   design has traditionally exceeded the potential aerodynamic gains. By
   expanding upon the previously developed cascading bimorph concept, this
   work uses embedded Macro-Fiber Composites and a flexure box mechanism,
   created using multi-material 3D printing, to achieve the Spanwise
   Morphing Trailing Edge (SMTE) concept. The morphing actuators are spaced
   spanwise along the wing with an elastomer spanning the gaps between
   them, which allows for optimization of the spanwise lift distribution
   while maintaining the continuity and efficiency of the morphing trailing
   edge. The concept is implemented in a representative section of a UAV
   wing with a 305 mm chord. A novel honeycomb skin is created from an
   elastomeric material using a 3D printer. The actuation capabilities of
   the concept are evaluated with and without spanning material on a test
   stand, free of aerodynamic loads. In addition, the actuation
   restrictions of the spanning elastomer, necessary in adapting the
   morphing concept from 2D to 3D, are characterized. Initial aerodynamic
   results from the 1' x 1' wind-tunnel also show the effects of
   aerodynamic loading on the actuation range of the SMTE concept for
   uniform morphing.}},

Abstract = {{Runtime systems to mitigate memory resource contention problems on
   multicore processors have recently attracted much research attention.
   One critical component of these runtimes is the indicators to rank and
   classify applications based on their contention characteristics.
   However, although there has been significant research effort,
   application contention characteristics remain not well understood and
   indicators have not been thoroughly evaluated.
   In this chapter, we performed a thorough study of applications'
   contention characteristics to develop better indicators to improve
   contention-aware runtime systems. The contention characteristics are
   composed of an application's contentiousness, and its sensitivity to
   contention. We show that contentiousness and sensitivity are not
   strongly correlated, and contrary to prior wisdom, a single indicator is
   not adequate to predict both. Also, while prior wisdom has relied on
   last level cache miss rate as one of the best indicators to predict an
   application's contention characteristics, we show that depending on the
   workloads, it can often be misleading. We then present prediction models
   that consider contention in various memory resources. Our regression
   analysis establishes an accurate model to predict application
   contentiousness. The analysis also demonstrates that performance
   counters alone may not be sufficient to accurately predict application
   sensitivity to contention. In this chapter, we also present an
   evaluation using SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks showing that, when predicting
   an application's contentiousness, the linear correlation coefficient R-2
   of our predictor and the real measured contentiousness is 0.834, as
   opposed to 0.224 when using last level cache miss rate.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a method for
   measuring fluorophore lifetimes with microscopic spatial resolution,
   providing a useful tool for cell biologists to detect, visualize, and
   investigate structure and function of biological systems. In this
   chapter, we begin by introducing the basic theory of fluorescence
   lifetime, including the characteristics of fluorophore decay, followed
   by a discussion of factors affecting fluorescence lifetimes and the
   potential advantages of fluorescence lifetime as a source of image
   contrast. Experimental methods for creating lifetime maps, including
   both time-and frequency-domain experimental approaches, are then
   introduced. Then, FLIM data analysis methods are discussed, including
   rapid lifetime determination, multiexponential fitting, Laguerre
   polynomial fitting, and phasor plot analysis. After, data analysis
   methods are introduced that improve lifetime precision of FLIM maps
   based upon optimal virtual gating and total variation denoising. The
   chapter concludes by highlighting several recent FLIM applications for
   quantitative biological imaging, including Forster resonance energy
   transfer-FLIM, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy-FLIM,
   multispectral-FLIM, and multiphoton-FLIM.}},

   in aerospace and other industries due to their superior physical
   attributes compared to traditional metallic structures. This has spurred
   the need for structural health monitoring (SHM) systems to support
   structural integrity. Guided wave (GW) based techniques for health
   monitoring have shown to be reliable and promising. The local
   interaction simulation approach (LISA), a finite difference based
   numerical method, has been proven to be efficient in modeling GW
   propagation in isotropic and composite plate structures. Piezoelectric
   actuators are traditionally used to generate GW in structures. In this
   work, iterative equations which form the basis of the LISA method are
   derived for a generic orthotropic laminated structure with a
   piezoelectric actuator on top. The piezoelectric actuator is modeled by
   considering the coupled electromechanical equations.}},

Title = {{On the impact of the regulatory frontal crash test speed on optimal
   vehicle design and road traffic injuries}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VEHICLE DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-60}},
Abstract = {{Many countries have instituted New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) to
   help consumers compare the crashworthiness of automobiles on the market.
   These typically involve four or five standardised tests, for which each
   new vehicle is rated on a 5-star scale. The ratings are available to
   customers and so, automakers strive for high scores by optimising their
   vehicle designs to the scenarios represented by the tests. The United
   States NCAP rates vehicles for frontal crashworthiness with a
   56-kilometre-per-hour (35-mile-per-hour) full-engagement barrier
   collision, which is a relatively severe test, considering that over 98\%
   of crashes on US roadways occur at slower speeds. This paper presents a
   methodology for understanding the impact of the NCAP crash test speed on
   vehicle design and the consequent on-road safety outcomes, using
   physics-based simulations and optimisation tools. The results suggest
   that lowering the test speed from the current level to 48 kilometres per
   hour (30 miles per hour) may decrease the rates of serious injuries to
   vehicle occupants in the US by up to 21\%.}},

Abstract = {{Decentralized control is a longstanding challenge in systems theory. A
   decentralized controller may consist of multiple local controllers,
   connected to disjoint or overlapping sets of sensors and actuators, and
   where each local controller has limited ability to communicate directly
   with the remaining local controllers and, in addition, may lack global
   knowledge of the plant and operation of the remaining local controllers.
   In the present paper we apply adaptive control to investigate the
   ability of the local controllers to cooperate globally despite
   uncertainty, communication constraints, and possibly conflicting
   performance objectives. The approach we apply in this paper is based on
   retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC). The development of RCAC
   assumes a centralized controller structure; the goal of the present
   paper is to investigate the stability and performance of RCAC in a
   decentralized setting.}},

Abstract = {{The velocity occupancy space (VOS) algorithm was developed to allow an
   unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to avoid moving and stationary obstacles
   and navigate efficiently to a goal using only uncertain sensor data. The
   original VOS concept was designed for an ideal, holonomic UGV that was
   capable of perfect, repeatable and instantaneous velocity changes. The
   method presented here adapts VOS through the use of extended velocity
   obstacles (EVOs) so that VOS can operate on experimental UGVs that
   suffer from actuation error. For this research, the EVOs have been
   designed based on the performance of a SuperDroid ATR, but they can be
   easily calibrated for other velocity controlled UGVs. The proposed
   method is validated through numerous simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Velocity Occupancy Space (VOS) is an algorithm used to perform real-time
   moving obstacle avoidance for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs).
   Pedestrian safety and comfort must be ensured by the guidance algorithm
   when UGVs operate near pedestrians. Studies on human interactions are
   used to formulate desired behavior of the UGV as it avoids people. Then,
   VOS is enhanced with improved avoidance behavior We investigate three
   potential methods for enhancing pedestrian safety and comfort. To study
   the effect of these enhancements, numerical simulations of a large set
   of randomly generated scenarios. The number of collisions, and minimum
   required opening width, were used to characterize the performance of
   each avoidance enhancement technique. Two of the methods eliminate
   collisions with pedestrians; the preferred technique, which artificially
   enlarges the size of detected pedestrians, accomplishes this
   consistently.}},

Abstract = {{Health management of Li-ion batteries depends on knowledge of certain
   battery internal dynamics (e.g., lithium consumption and film growth at
   the solid-electrolyte interface) whose inputs and outputs are not
   directly measurable with noninvasive methods. This presents a problem of
   identification of inaccessible subsystems. To address this problem, we
   apply the retrospective-cost subsystem identification (RCSI) method. As
   a first step, this paper presents a simulation-based study that assumes
   as the truth model of the battery an electrochemistry-based battery
   charge/discharge model of Doyle, Fuller, and Newman, and later augmented
   with a battery-health model by Ramadass. First, this truth model is used
   to generate the data needed for the identification study. Next, the
   film-growth component of the battery-health model is assumed to be
   unknown, and the identification of this inaccessible subsystem is
   performed using RCSI. The results show that the subsystem identification
   method can identify the film growth quite accurately when the chemical
   reactions leading to film growth are consequential.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges of co-simulating hardware-in-the-loop systems
   in real-time over the Internet is the fidelity of the simulation. The
   dynamics of the Internet may significantly distort the dynamics of the
   network-integrated system. This paper presents the development of an
   iterative learning control based approach to improve fidelity of such
   networked system integration. Towards this end, a new metric for
   characterizing fidelity is proposed first, which, unlike some existing
   metrics, does not require knowledge about the reference dynamics (i.e.,
   dynamics that would be observed, if the system was physically
   connected). Next, using this metric, the problem of improving fidelity
   is formulated as an iterative learning control problem. Finally, the
   proposed approach is illustrated on a purely simulation-based case study
   The conclusion is that the proposed approach holds significant potential
   for achieving high fidelity levels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a development of a robust steering controller that
   can be used for backing up maneuver of tractor-trailer vehicles.
   Tractor-trailer vehicles are naturally unstable when backing up
   maneuvers are performed. It is even more challenging for an inexperience
   driver to backing a trailer along a straight line since small errors in
   steering are amplified and the vehicle often departs from the desired
   path. Therefore it is desirable to develop a control system that can be
   used for such a scenario. In this paper, a robust controller is
   developed by using Lyapunov method based on a kinematic vehicle model
   for an application of tractor-trailer vehicles operating at a low speed
   in which state and input constraints are explicitly considered. The
   simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.}},

   pedagogy/direct instruction still rules the land. Whether it is a

   places, ought not to be the overwhelmingly dominant pedagogy. So, why
   has this pedagogy not been replaced by the better pedagogy? The truth is
   this: enacting a learn-by-doing pedagogy (or project-based learning,
   inquiry-based learning, active learning, etc.) is really difficult to
   do; it requires considerable time on the teacher's part as well as deep

Abstract = {{The Internet has facilitated the development of e-businesses using
   web-based services leveraging back-end database systems, inventory
   systems and payment processing systems. Online retail businesses can be
   set up in a relatively short period of time. In contrast, set-up of a
   manufacturing system takes much longer; the system design involves
   various stages from gaining an understanding of the product and its
   market to machine selection, layout, control logic, part flow analysis
   and so on. Cyberinfrastructure has the potential to revolutionize the
   design and operation of manufacturing systems by creating a
   collaborative environment distributed across a number of physical
   locations through web-based virtual communities, thereby simplifying and
   streamlining the manufacturing system design and integration. This paper
   describes how current technologies could facilitate the implementation
   of a cyberinfrastructure for manufacturing. A case study describing a
   current manufacturing system architecture and how a future one would use
   cyberinfrastructure is used to describe major gaps that exist and
   standards that need to be developed.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic welding is a solid-state bond created using ultrasonic
   energy. It has been used in the semiconductor industry for several
   decades, and more recently, in the automotive industry such as for
   battery welding. Even though there existed several numerical simulations
   on ultrasonic welding, the models were too simplistic, in both theory
   and welding configuration, to present the multiple sheet, dissimilar
   metal ultrasonic welding. In this study, theories and a finite element
   procedure for the ultrasonic welding process are developed. The
   procedure invokes both Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit to simulate
   the mechanical-thermal coupled phenomena over the entire weld duration
   with moderate computational cost. The procedure is verified and used to
   simulate selected specific cases involving multiple sheets and
   dissimilar materials, i.e., copper and aluminum. The simulation
   procedure demonstrates its capability to predict welding energy and
   temperature distribution of the workpieces, towards the goal of
   improving welding quality.}},

Abstract = {{While sensing technologies for structural monitoring applications have
   made significant advances over the last several decades, there is still
   room for improvement in terms of computational efficiency, as well as
   overall energy consumption. The biological nervous system can offer a
   potential solution to address these current deficiencies. The nervous
   system is capable of sensing and aggregating information about the
   external environment through very crude processing units known as
   neurons. Neurons effectively communicate in an extremely condensed
   format by encoding information into binary electrical spike trains,
   thereby reducing the amount of raw information sent throughout a neural
   network. Due to its unique signal processing capabilities, the mammalian
   cochlea and its interaction with the biological nervous system is of
   particular interest for devising compressive sensing strategies for
   dynamic engineered systems. The cochlea uses a novel method of place
   theory and frequency decomposition, thereby allowing for rapid signal
   processing within the nervous system. In this study, a low-power sensing
   node is proposed that draws inspiration from the mechanisms employed by
   the cochlea and the biological nervous system. As such, the sensor is
   able to perceive and transmit a compressed representation of the
   external stimulus with minimal distortion. Each sensor represents a
   basic building block, with function similar to the neuron, and can form
   a network with other sensors, thus enabling a system that can convey
   input stimulus in an extremely condensed format. The proposed sensor is
   validated through a structural monitoring application of a single degree
   of freedom structure excited by seismic ground motion.}},

Abstract = {{Kinesins are nano-sized biological motors which are responsible for
   active transport in cells. A single kinesin molecule is able to
   transport its cargo about 1 mu m in the absence of external loads.
   However, kinesins perform much longer range transport in cells by
   working collectively. One of the most important mechanisms involved in
   this long transport are the binding and unbinding of kinesins to
   microtubules. Kinesins realize the transport by a repetitive
   mechanochemical cycle. In this study, the unbinding probabilities
   corresponding to each mechanochemical state of kinesin are calculated.
   The statistical characterization of the instants and locations of
   binding are captured by computing the probability of unbound kinesin
   being at given locations. The forces acting on kinesins affect binding
   and unbinding. This effect is also considered in this study. It reveals
   that the length of the transport is significantly longer when multiple
   proteins cooperatively transport the same cargo.}},

Title = {{On being the right size: scaling effects in designing a human-on-a-chip}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{1149-1161}},
Abstract = {{Developing a human-on-a-chip by connecting multiple model organ systems
   would provide an intermediate screen for therapeutic efficacy and toxic
   side effects of drugs prior to conducting expensive clinical trials.
   However, correctly designing individual organs and scaling them relative
   to each other to make a functional microscale human analog is
   challenging, and a generalized approach has yet to be identified. In
   this work, we demonstrate the importance of rational design of both the
   individual organ and its relationship with other organs, using a simple
   two-compartment system simulating insulin-dependent glucose uptake in
   adipose tissues. We demonstrate that inter-organ scaling laws depend on
   both the number of cells and the spatial arrangement of those cells
   within the microfabricated construct. We then propose a simple and novel
   inter-organ `metabolically supported functional scaling' approach
   predicated on maintaining in vivo cellular basal metabolic rates by
   limiting resources available to cells on the chip. This approach
   leverages findings from allometric scaling models in mammals that
   limited resources in vivo prompt cells to behave differently than in
   resource-rich in vitro cultures. Although applying scaling laws directly
   to tissues can result in systems that would be quite challenging to
   implement, engineering workarounds may be used to circumvent these
   scaling issues. Specific workarounds discussed include the limited
   oxygen carrying capacity of cell culture media when used as a blood
   substitute and the ability to engineer non-physiological structures to
   augment organ function, to create the transport-accessible, yet
   resource-limited environment necessary for cells to mimic in vivo
   functionality. Furthermore, designing the structure of individual
   tissues in each organ compartment may be a useful strategy to bypass
   scaling concerns at the inter-organ level.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{74-82}},
Abstract = {{A modeling study on energy absorption and transport in an isolated
   nanoshell and aggregates of nanoshells under localized surface plasma
   resonance (SPR) conditions is presented. A comprehensive model for
   multi-scattering of electromagnetic waves by a cluster of multilayered
   nanoshells is developed, which applies the Wigner-Eckart theorem for the
   calculation of the total scattering cross sessions of nanoshell
   aggregates. Absorption by an isolated nanoshell and by nanoshell
   clusters is studied using the model. Results show that the
   inter-nanoshell coupling results in strong field enhancement near the
   particle surface. Energy absorption in a nanoshell can be tuned by
   varying the structural parameters of the nanoshell. Smaller particles
   are more absorbing than the large ones, other conditions being equal.
   Because of the presence of a dielectric cavity, the radial distribution
   of the absorbed power in the metal shell may differ from the classical
   skin depth phenomena. The interaction among particles in close proximity
   causes the energy absorption efficiency and the resonance position of a
   nanoshell cluster to differ from those of an isolated nanoshell.}},

Abstract = {{Variational methods are useful for solving ill-posed inverse imaging
   problems by minimizing a cost function with a data fidelity term and a
   regularization term. For statistical X-ray computed tomography (CT)
   image reconstruction, penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) criteria
   with edge-preserving regularization can improve quality of the
   reconstructed image compared to traditional filtered back-projection
   (FBP) reconstruction. Nevertheless, the huge dynamic range of the
   statistical weights used in PWLS image reconstruction leads to a highly
   shift-variant local impulse response, making effective preconditioning
   difficult. To overcome this problem, iterative algorithms based on
   variable splitting were proposed recently.(1,2) However, existing
   splitting-based iterative algorithms do not consider the (unknown) gain
   fluctuations that can occur between views.(3) This paper proposes a new
   variational formulation for splitting-based iterative algorithms where
   the unknown gain parameter vector and the image are estimated jointly
   with just simple changes to the original algorithms. Simulations show
   that the proposed algorithm greatly reduces the shading artifacts caused
   by gain fluctuations yet with almost unchanged computational complexity
   per iteration.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a monolithic subsystem that integrates a micro-gas
   chromatography (mu GC) separation column and on-column, non-destructive
   Fabry-Perot (FP) vapor sensors on a single silicon chip. The device was
   fabricated using deep reactive ion etching of silicon to create fluidic
   channels and polymers were deposited on the same silicon chip to act as
   a stationary phase or an FP sensor, thus avoiding dead volumes caused by
   the interconnects between the column and sensor traditionally used in mu
   GC. Two integration designs were studied. In the first design, the mu GC
   column was coated with a layer of polymer that served as both the
   stationary phase and the FP sensor, which has the greatest level of
   integration. In the second design, a FP sensor array spray-coated with
   different vapor sensing polymers was integrated with the mu GC column,
   which significantly improves the system flexibility and detection
   sensitivity. With this design, we show that the FP sensors have a
   detection limit on the order of tens of picograms with a sub-second
   response time. Furthermore, FP sensor array are shown to respond to a
   mixture of analytes separated by the integrated separation channel,
   allowing for the construction of response patterns, which, along with
   retention time, can be used as a basis of analyte identification.}},

Abstract = {{The apatite-type structure of A(4)(I)A(6)(II)(BO4)(6)(OH, F, Cl)(2)
   (A(I), A(II) = Ca, Na, rare earths, fission product elements such as I
   and Tc, and/or actinides; B = Si, P, V, or Cr) offers unique structural
   advantages as an advanced nuclear waste form because a wide variety of
   actinides and fission products can be incorporated into the structure
   through coupled cation and anion substitutions. However, apatite
   undergoes a radiation-induced crystalline-to-amorphous transition, and
   previously, the effect of composition on the radiation-induced
   transformation has not been well understood. In this study, we
   demonstrate that vanadate-phosphate fluorapatite's radiation tolerance
   can be controlled by varying the composition. Enhanced radiation
   tolerance is achieved by replacing vanadium with phosphorus at the
   B-site or by replacing Pb with Ca at the A-site. Correlations among
   chemical composition, radiation performance and electronic to nuclear
   stopping power ratio were demonstrated and suggest that the ionization
   process resulting from electronic energy loss may enhance annealing of

Abstract = {{Purpose: It is currently a challenge to determine the biomechanical
   properties of the hard tissue-dental implant interface. Recent advances
   in intraoral imaging and tomographic methods, such as microcomputed
   tomography (micro-CT), provide three-dimensional details, offering
   significant potential to evaluate the bone-implant interface, but yield
   limited information regarding osseointegration because of physical
   scattering effects emanating from metallic implant surfaces. In the
   present study, it was hypothesized that functional apparent moduli
   (FAM), generated from functional incorporation of the peri-implant
   structure, would eliminate the radiographic artifact-affected layer and
   serve as a feasible means to evaluate the biomechanical dynamics of
   tissue-implant integration in vivo. Materials and Methods: Cylindric
   titanium mini-implants were placed in osteotomies and osteotomies with
   defects in rodent maxillae. The layers affected by radiographic
   artifacts were identified, and the pattern of tissue-implant integration
   was evaluated from histology and micro-CT images over a 21-day
   observation period. Analyses of structural information, FAM, and the
   relationship between FAM and interfacial stiffness (IS) were done before
   and after eliminating artifacts. Results: Physical artifacts were
   present within a zone of about 100 to 150 mu m around the implant in
   both experimental defect situations (osteotomy alone and osteotomy +
   defect). All correlations were evaluated before and after eliminating
   the artifact-affected layers, most notably during the maturation period
   of osseointegration. A strong correlation existed between functional
   bone apparent modulus and IS within 300 mu m at the osteotomy defects (r
   > 0.9) and functional composite tissue apparent modulus in the osteotomy
   defects (r > 0.75). Conclusion: Micro-CT imaging and FAM were of value
   in measuring the temporal process of tissue-implant integration in vivo.
   This approach will be useful to complement imaging technologies for
   longitudinal monitoring of osseointegration.}},

Abstract = {{Blue- and green-emitting laser heterostructures, incorporating InGaN/GaN
   quantum dots as the active medium have been grown by molecular beam
   epitaxy. The quantum dot growth parameters have been optimized to obtain
   the highest photoluminescence intensity and radiative efficiency in the
   blue (lambda= 420 nm) and green (lambda= 545 nm). The blue and green
   lasers are characterized by threshold current densities of 930 A/cm(2)
   and 1.65 kA/cm(2), respectively, under quasi-continuous wave bias. To
   further reduce the threshold current density in the green-emitting
   devices, a tunnel injection scheme is used to inject cold holes into the
   quantum dot lasing states. These devices are characterized by a reduced
   threshold current density of 945 A/cm(2). The measured differential gain
   in the blue-emitting lasers is 2 x 10(-16) cm(2). Slope efficiencies of
   0.41 W/A and 0.25 W/A have been measured, corresponding to differential
   quantum efficiencies of 13.9\% and 11.3\%, in the blue and green lasers,

Abstract = {{This paper presents piezoelectric transduction and frequency trimming of
   silicon-based resonators with a center frequency in the low megahertz
   regime. The temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of the resonators
   is reduced using both passive and active compensation schemes.
   Specifically, a novel technique utilizing oxide-refilled trenches is
   implemented to achieve efficient temperature compensation while
   maintaining compatibility with wet release processes. Using this method,
   we demonstrate high-Q resonators having a first-order TCF as low as 3
   ppm/degrees C and a turnover temperature of around 90 degrees C, ideally
   suited for use in ovenized platforms. Using active tuning, the
   temperature sensitivity of the resonator is further compensated around
   the turnover temperature, demonstrating frequency instability of less
   than 400 ppb. Such devices are ideally suited as timing units in space
   applications where size, power consumption, and temperature stability
   are of critical importance.}},

Abstract = {{Two methods are presented to model assembly systems where repetitive
   operations are integrated in one single machine following strictly
   planned sequences. The first method introduces an aggregate machine to
   approximate the original repetitive assembly machine so that the
   aggregate machine and the original machine have equivalent behaviors on
   processing time, machine reliability and maintainability. The second
   method transforms the repetitive assembly operations into a series of
   synchronized assembly/disassembly models so that the traditional
   assembly model can be applied to analyze such repetitive assembly
   machines. We systematically compare the accuracy of those two new models

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to monitor temperature in neurosurgical
   bone grinding procedure using the motor electrical power as input. Bone
   grinding is a critical procedure in the skull base neurosurgery to
   remove the cranial bone and approach the tumor through the sphenoid
   sinus. Heat generated during grinding could damage the optic nerve or
   coagulate the blood in the carotid artery, while direct temperature
   measurement is difficult. The temperature estimation is realized using a
   heat conversion model and the thermal model based on finite element
   analysis (FEA). The heat conversion model determines heat generation
   based on its linear correlation to the motor electrical power. The FEA
   thermal model calculates the temperature on the bone surface using the
   obtained heat. Bone grinding experiments are conducted, and results
   demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of proposed model for
   monitoring local temperature in endonasal bone grinding. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Improvement in the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of InGaN/GaN
   disks-in-nanowires by surface passivation is demonstrated. The highest
   IQE achieved through surface passivation for green emitting (lambda=540
   nm) InGaN/GaN disks-in-nanowires is similar to 53\%. Radiative and
   nonradiative carrier lifetimes are calculated for as-grown and surface
   passivated green emitting disks-in-nanowires. Passivated green sample
   exhibits a room temperature radiative lifetime of similar to 748 ps,
   which is much smaller than that of equivalent quantum wells.
   Electroluminescence measurements on passivated green light emitting
   diodes containing InGaN disks demonstrate no roll over or efficiency
   droop up to 375 A/cm(2), and exhibit a blue-shift of 7 nm in peak
   wavelength. An enhancement in the light output due to surface
   passivation is observable in the relative external quantum efficiency of
   the surface passivated devices as compared with the as-grown samples.

Abstract = {{Objective: Determine the effects of BMI on the risk of serious-to-fatal
   injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale >= 3 or AIS 3+) to different body
   regions for adults in frontal, nearside, farside, and rollover crashes.
   Design and Methods: Multivariate logistic regression analysis was
   applied to a probability sample of adult occupants involved in crashes
   generated by combining the National Automotive Sampling System
   (NASS-CDS) with a pseudoweighted version of the Crash Injury Research
   and Engineering Network database. Logistic regression models were
   applied to weighted data to estimate the change in the number of
   occupants with AIS 3+ injuries if no occupants were obese.
   Results: Increasing BMI increased risk of lower-extremity injury in
   frontal crashes, decreased risk of lower-extremity injury in nearside
   impacts, increased risk of upper-extremity injury in frontal and
   nearside crashes, and increased risk of spine injury in frontal crashes.
   Several of these findings were affected by interactions with gender and
   vehicle type. If no occupants in frontal crashes were obese, 7\% fewer
   occupants would sustain AIS 3+ upper-extremity injuries, 8\% fewer
   occupants would sustain AIS 3+ lower-extremity injuries, and 28\% fewer
   occupants would sustain AIS 3+ spine injuries.
   Conclusions: Results of this study have implications on the design and
   evaluation of vehicle safety systems.}},

   resulted in many exciting discoveries and applications, including
   organic light-emitting devices for information display and illumination,

   optoelectronic materials are broadly classified as polymeric or small
   molecular. For the latter category, solvent-free deposition techniques
   are generally preferred to form well-defined interfaces and improve
   device performance. This article reviews several deposition and
   patterning methods for small molecular thin films and devices, including
   organic molecular beam deposition, vacuum thermal evaporation, organic
   vapor phase deposition, and organic vapor jet printing, and compares
   them to several other methods that have been proposed recently. We hope
   this review provides a compact but informative summary of the state of
   the art in organic device processing and addresses the various
   techniques' governing physical principles.}},

   three distinct but related problems, namely, state estimation, input
   estimation, and model refinement. To illustrate these techniques, we
   give two examples. In the first example, retrospective cost model
   refinement is used with synthetic data to estimate the cooling dynamics
   that are missing from a model of the ionosphere-thermosphere. In the
   second example, retrospective cost adaptive state estimation is used
   with data from a satellite to estimate a solar driver in the
   ionosphere-thermosphere, with performance gauged by using data from a
   second satellite.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel 3-D fabrication process of microstructures
   using high-Q materials. The key feature of this process is the use of a
   blow torch that can provide intensive localized heat up to 2500 degrees
   C in a very short time (<10 sec), above the melting temperatures of many
   high-Q materials such as fused silica. Surface roughness of 5.3 angstrom
   is realized in fused silica, which is crucial for high optical and
   mechanical quality factors (Q). We demonstrate the fabrication of micro
   hemisphere and half-toroid (birdbath) geometries from 100 mu m-thick
   fused silica substrates. We also create micro birdbath resonators by
   batch-level releasing the birdbath shells and demonstrate one of the
   best mechanical Q and low stiffness and damping anisotropies among
   existing micro mechanical resonators. The birdbath resonator is
   promising for emerging applications such as micro rate-integrating
   gyroscope (mu-RIG).}},

   of germanium tellurium, a PC material, and its use in RF switching
   applications. Intrinsic resistance and capacitance at the ON

Abstract = {{We present a novel design of micropumps and valves driven by osmotic
   force for point-of-care applications. Although there have been
   significant progresses in microfluidic components and control devices
   such as fluidic diodes, switches, resonators and digital-to-analog
   converters, the ultimate power source still depends on bulky off-chip
   components, which are expensive and cannot be easily miniaturized. For
   point-of-care applications, it is critical to integrate all the
   components in a compact size at low cost. In this work, we report two
   key active components actuated by osmotic mechanism for total integrated
   microfluidic system. For the proof of concept, we have demonstrated
   valve actuation, which can maintain stable ON/OFF switching operations
   under 125 kPa back pressure. We have also implemented an osmotic pump,
   which can pump a high flow rate over 30 mu L/min for longer than 30
   minutes. The experimental data demonstrates the possibility and
   potential of applying osmotic actuation in point-of-care disposable
   microfluidics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the effect of initial conditions on the behavior of
   coupled frictional elastic systems subject to periodic loading.
   Previously, it has been conjectured that the long term response will be
   independent of initial conditions if all nodes slip at least once during
   each loading cycle. Here, this conjecture is disproved in the context of
   a simple two-node system. Counter examples are presented of
   ``unstable{''} steady-state orbits that repel orbits starting from
   initial conditions that are sufficiently close to the steady state. The
   conditions guaranteeing stability of such steady states are shown to be
   more restrictive than those required for the rate problem to be uniquely
   solvable for arbitrary derivative of the external loading. In cases of
   instability, the transient orbit is eventually limited either by slip
   occurring at both nodes simultaneously, or by one node separating. In
   both cases a stable limit cycle is obtained. Depending on the slopes of
   the constraint lines, the limit cycle can involve two periods of the
   loading cycle, in which case it appears to be unique, or it may repeat
   every loading cycle, in which case distinct limit cycles are reached
   depending on the sign of the initial deviation from the steady state. In
   the case of instability an example is given of a loading for which a
   quasi-static evolution problem with multiple solutions exists, whereas
   all rate problems are uniquely solvable.}},

Pages = {{932-939}},
Abstract = {{Through microfluidic interrogation we analyzed real-time calcium
   responses of HEK293 cells stimulated with short pulses of the M-3
   muscarinic receptor ligand carbachol in two different concentration
   regimes. Lower ligand concentrations elicit oscillatory calcium signals
   while higher concentrations trigger a rapid rise that eventually settles
   down at a steady-state slightly above pre-stimulus levels, referred to
   as an acute signal. Cells were periodically pulsed with carbachol at
   these two concentration regimes using a custom-made microfluidic
   platform, and the resulting calcium signals were measured with a single
   fluorescent readout. Pulsed stimulations at these two concentration
   regimes resulted in multiple types of response patterns that each
   delivered complementary information about the M-3 muscarinic receptor
   signaling pathway. These multiple types of calcium response patterns
   enabled development of a comprehensive mathematical model of
   multi-regime calcium signaling. The resulting model suggests that
   dephosphorylation of deactivated receptors is rate limiting for recovery
   of calcium signals in the acute regime (high ligand concentration),
   while calcium replenishment and IP3 production determine signal recovery
   in the oscillatory regime (low ligand concentration). This study not
   only provides mechanistic insight into multi-regime signaling of the M-3
   muscarinic receptor pathway, but also provides a general strategy for
   analyzing multi-regime pathways using only one fluorescent readout.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale resistive switching devices (memristive devices or memristors)
   have been studied for a number of applications ranging from non-volatile
   memory, logic to neuromorphic systems. However a major challenge is to
   address the potentially large variations in space and time in these
   nanoscale devices. Here we show that in metal-filament based memristive
   devices the switching can be fully stochastic. While individual
   switching events are random, the distribution and probability of
   switching can be well predicted and controlled. Rather than trying to
   force high switching probabilities using excess voltage or time, the
   inherent stochastic nature of resistive switching allows these binary
   devices to be used as building blocks for novel error-tolerant computing
   schemes such as stochastic computing and provides the needed
   ``analog{''} feature for neuromorphic applications. To verify such
   potential, we demonstrated memristor-based stochastic bitstreams in both
   time and space domains, and show that an array of binary memristors can
   act as a multi-level ``analog{''} device for neuromorphic applications.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{11511-11519}},
Abstract = {{Engineering the density of carbon nanotube (CNT) forest microstructures
   is vital to applications such as electrical interconnects, micro-contact
   probes, and thermal interface materials. For CNT forests on
   centimeter-scale substrates, weight and volume can be used to calculate
   density. However, this is not suitable for smaller samples, including
   individual microstructures, and moreover does not enable mapping of
   spatial density variations within the forest. We demonstrate that the
   relative mass density of individual CNT microstructures can be measured
   by optical attenuation, with spatial resolution equaling the size of the
   focused spot. For this, a custom optical setup was built to measure the
   transmission of a focused laser beam through CNT microstructures. The
   transmittance was correlated with the thickness of the CNT
   microstructures by Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law to calculate the attenuation
   coefficient. We reveal that the density of CNT microstructures grown by
   CVD can depend on their size, and that the overall density of arrays of
   microstructures is affected significantly by run-to-run process
   variations. Further, we use the technique to quantify the change in CNT
   microstructure density due to capillary densification. This is a useful
   and accessible metrology technique for CNTs in future microfabrication
   processes, and will enable direct correlation of density to important
   properties such as stiffness and electrical conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional methods of camera orientation control for teleoperated
   robots involve gamepads or joysticks with the motion of analog sticks
   used to control the camera direction. However, this control scheme often
   leads to unintuitive mappings between user input and camera actuator
   output. This paper describes a master-slave style camera position and
   orientation controller with a tablet computer showing a video feed from
   the robot mounted on a balance-arm (acting as the control master),
   affording the user a one-to-one mapping to control the viewpoint of a
   camera mounted on a robot arm (the slave). In this way, the tablet
   computer acts as a virtual window to the robot's workspace.}},

   application that simulates the ion beam trajectories through the
   implanter from the ion source to the target was developed using the

   understanding of abstract physics phenomena and diagnose ion
   trajectories. Using this application, new implanter users of different
   fields in science quickly understand how the machine works and quickly
   learn to operate it. In this article we describe the implanter
   simulation application and compare the parameters of the implanter
   components obtained from the simulations with the measured ones. The
   overall agreement between the simulated and measured values of magnetic

Abstract = {{Needle is one of the most common features in medical devices. A better
   understanding of needle tip geometry can lead to the creation of an
   optimized needle tip geometry which would greatly benefit the procedure
   of biopsy or insertion guidance. This study reviews the recent
   researches on needle cutting edge with high inclination angle, and
   applications in needle core biopsy and insertion guidance. The
   mathematical models of the inclination and rake angles for the needle
   with lancet point and enhanced cutting edge needles are developed. To
   improve the biopsy length, a novel approach to use the enhanced cutting
   edge needle to acquire the tissue sample is studied and the concept is
   experimentally validated. To reduce needle deflection and increase
   insertion accuracy, the effects of grid constraints, needle material,
   and insertion speed are analyzed. The knowledge gained from this study
   can be used to better understand needle tissue cutting mechanics and
   integrate these technologies for more efficient needle biopsy and
   accurate insertion guidance procedures.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the confinement of gold nanoparticles, onto which
   poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP) are end-tethered, within diblock copolymer
   polystyrene-b-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) micelles in a
   polystyrene (PS) host. The micellar nanocomposites were prepared by spin
   casting mixtures of the nanoparticles, the copolymer and the homopolymer
   chains onto a substrate, to form films approximately 110 nm thick. The
   samples were then annealed above the glass transitions of the polymers,
   resulting in the formation of spherical micelles, composed of inner
   cores of the P2VP segments and outer coronas comprising the PS blocks,
   throughout the PS homopolymer thin film host. All nanoparticles were
   encapsulated within micelle cores; on average each micelle contains one,
   or no, nanoparticle. The micelles exhibited a strong tendency to
   self-organize at interfaces when the PS homopolymer chain length is
   large compared to the PS corona chain length; they otherwise remain
   distributed throughout the film. In comparison to pure PS-b-P2VP/PS
   blends, the nanoparticle/PS-bP2VP/ PS blends contain a higher density
   of, on average, smaller micelles. This sample fabrication procedure is
   straightforward and compliments the current ``toolbox{''} used to create
   functional materials from block copolymer-nanoparticle systems.}},

Volume = {{160}},

Abstract = {{As has been experimentally observed, stresses due to lithium
   intercalation, phase transition, and thermal loading can cause local
   fractures in Li-ion battery active materials. These fractures are one of
   the main degradation mechanisms in Li-ion batteries. Consequently,
   predicting the stress level inside of the electrode material is of key
   importance in designing cells and determining their operation
   conditions. For lithium manganese oxides, however, the values of Young's
   modulus that have been reported so far differ widely, resulting in
   commensurately wide gaps between actual and predicted stress levels.
   Moreover, little is known about how the Young's modulus changes at
   different states of charge (SOC). In this study, molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations were performed to investigate the Young's moduli of LixMn2O4
   as a function of SOC (0 < x < 1). MD simulations show that the Young's
   moduli vary almost 18\% depending on SOC. By decomposing interaction
   forces between atoms, we analyzed how pair interactions influence the
   variance. The results suggest that the SOC-dependence of Young's modulus
   may have an effect on both the stress level inside the particle as well
   as on Li-ion transport as a result of their mutual coupling to Li-ion
   diffusivity. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{OPTIK}},

Volume = {{124}},

Pages = {{1278-1286}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents analytical solutions for the nonlinear problem of
   electrostatically actuated torsional micromirrors considering the
   bending of the torsional beams. First the energy method is used for
   finding the equilibrium equations. Then the explicit function theorem is
   utilized for finding the equations governing the instability mode of the
   mirror. These equations are then solved using Homotopy Perturbation
   Method (FIPM) for the especial case of alpha = 0 where a is a small
   nondimensional geometrical parameter defining the starting point of the
   underneath electrodes. Then straight forward perturbation method is
   applied for finding the pull-in angle and pull-in displacement of the
   micromirror for the general case of alpha not equal 0. The presented
   results which were in excellent agreement with numerical simulations
   show that neglecting the bending effect in electrostatic torsion micro
   actuators can lead to several hundred percent of overestimation of the
   stability limits of the device. In order to study the voltage-angle and
   voltage-displacement behavior of the micromirror, equilibrium equations
   are solved using HPM. Presented results are in good agreement with
   numerical simulations and also with experimental findings. (C) 2012

Title = {{Synthesis and structure of alpha-substituted pentathienoacenes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{3686-3694}},
Abstract = {{Recent progress in thienoacene development has produced numerous high
   performance, air-stable organic semiconductor materials.
   Pentathienoacene (T5) thin film devices have shown poor performance
   despite promising computational studies, likely due to high mobility
   anisotropy and poor film morphology. 2,6-Bis-alkyl-pentathienoacene has
   been synthesized to enable solution-processing routes to better
   microstructures of T5-based devices. Soluble side groups are introduced
   to thieno{[}3,2-b]-thiophene precursors through deprotonation at
   alpha-positions. Introduction of the sulfur bridge was achieved by
   Pd-catalyzed coupling reaction with bis(tri-n-butyltin) sulfide
   (Bu3SnSSnBu3), followed by final ring closure through oxidative coupling
   with CuCl2. This method achieves higher purity and higher yield than
   sulfide-quenched Li-Br exchange. UV-vis and fluorescence emission
   spectra show a bathochromic shift of approximate to 10 nm, indicating
   the introduction of alkyl chains decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap. X-ray
   analysis yields unit cells for 2,6-bis-octyl and 2,6-bis-dodecyl
   substituted T5s (C8-T5 and C12-T5, respectively). C8-T5 grows
   orthorhombic crystals with lattice parameters a = 1.15 nm, b = 0.43 nm
   and c = 3.05 nm; C12-T5 grows monoclinic crystals (c-unique) with unit
   cell with parameters a 1.10 nm, b = 0.42 nm, c = 3.89 nm and gamma =
   92.9 degrees. Both materials grow large (>50 mu m), faceted, single
   crystals that are microscopically composed of alternating layers of
   semiconducting cores and insulating substitutions.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of secondary ionmass spectrometry, ion-matter interactions
   have been largely investigated by numerical simulations. For molecular
   dynamics simulations related to inorganic samples, mostly classical
   force fields assuming stable bonding structure have been used. In this
   paper, we will use a reactive force field capable of simulating the
   breaking and formation of chemical bonds. Important features of this
   force field for simulating systems that undergo significant structural
   reorganisation are (i) the ability to account for the redistribution of
   electron density upon ionization, formation, or breaking of bonds,
   through a charge transfer term, and (ii) the fact that the angular
   constraints dynamically adjust when a change in the coordination number
   of an atom occurs. In this work, we present results obtained for the
   simulation of low-energy oxygen bombardment of crystalline and amorphous
   silicon. Information on variation of sputtering yields, energy, and
   angular distributions as well as the emission of clusters are studied.
   Compared to normal force fields, ion-matter interactions as well as the
   sputtering of matter should be described more accurately, especially
   when using reactive primary ions (oxygen or cesium) at low impact
   energies. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Stem Cell Therapy for Craniofacial Bone Regeneration: A Randomized,
   Controlled Feasibility Trial}},
Journal = {{CELL TRANSPLANTATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{767-777}},
Abstract = {{Stem cell therapy offers potential in the regeneration of craniofacial
   bone defects; however, it has not been studied clinically. Tissue repair
   cells (TRCs) isolated from bone marrow represent a mixed stem and
   progenitor population enriched in CD90- and CD14-positive cells. In this
   phase I/II randomized, controlled feasibility trial, we investigated TRC
   cell therapy to reconstruct localized craniofacial bone defects.
   Twenty-four patients requiring localized reconstruction of jawbone
   defects participated in this longitudinal trial. For regenerative
   therapy, patients were randomized to receive either guided bone
   regeneration (GBR) or TRC transplantation. At 6 or 12 weeks following
   treatment, clinical and radiographic assessments of bone repair were
   performed. Bone biopsies were harvested and underwent quantitative
   micro-computed tomographic (mu CT) and bone histomorphometric analyses.
   Oral implants were installed, subsequently restored, and functionally
   loaded with tooth restorations. Reconstructed sites were assessed for 1
   year following therapy. No study-related, serious adverse events were
   reported. Following therapy, clinical, radiographic, tomographic, and
   histological measures demonstrated that TRC therapy accelerated alveolar
   bone regeneration compared to GBR therapy. Additionally, TRC treatment
   significantly reduced the need for secondary bone grafting at the time
   of oral implant placement with a five-fold decrease in implant bony
   dehiscence exposure (residual bone defects) as compared to GBR-treated
   sites (p < 0.01). Transplantation of TRCs for treatment of alveolar bone
   defects appears safe and accelerates bone regeneration, enabling jawbone
   reconstruction with oral implants. The results from this trial support
   expanded studies of TRC therapy in the treatment of craniofacial
   deformities (ClinicalTrials.gov number CT00755911).}},

   cycle. In particular, when the travel distance exceeds the all-electric
   range (AER) of a PHEV and when tailpipe emissions are considered,
   optimal operation of the PHEV must consider optimization of the
   performance over a time horizon. In this paper, we develop a method to
   synthesize a supervisory powertrain controller (SPC) that achieves
   near-optimal fuel economy and tailpipe emissions under known travel
   distances. We first find the globally optimal solution using the dynamic
   programming (DP) technique, which provides an optimal control policy and
   state trajectories. Based on the analysis of the optimal state
   trajectories, a new variable energy-to-distance ratio (EDR), theta, is
   introduced to quantify the level of battery state-of-charge (SOC)
   relative to the remaining distance. This variable plays an important
   role in adjusting both energy and catalyst thermal management strategies
   for PHEVs. A novel extraction method is developed to extract adjustable
   engine on/off, gear-shift, and power-split strategies from the DP
   control policy over the entire state space. Based on the extracted
   results, an adaptive SPC that optimally adjusts the engine on/off,
   gear-shift, and power-split strategies under various EDR and catalyst
   temperature conditions was developed to achieve near-optimal fuel
   economy and emission performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a strategy to coordinate the charging of autonomous
   plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) using concepts from non-cooperative
   games. The foundation of the paper is a model that assumes PEVs are
   cost-minimizing and weakly coupled via a common electricity price. At a
   Nash equilibrium, each PEV reacts optimally with respect to a commonly
   observed charging trajectory that is the average of all PEV strategies.
   This average is given by the solution of a fixed point problem in the
   limit of infinite population size. The ideal solution minimizes
   electricity generation costs by scheduling PEV demand to fill the
   overnight non-PEV demand ``valley{''}. The paper's central theoretical
   result is a proof of the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium that
   almost satisfies that ideal. This result is accompanied by a
   decentralized computational algorithm and a proof that the algorithm
   converges to the Nash equilibrium in the infinite system limit. Several
   numerical examples are used to illustrate the performance of the
   solution strategy for finite populations. The examples demonstrate that
   convergence to the Nash equilibrium occurs very quickly over a broad
   range of parameters, and suggest this method could be useful in
   situations where frequent communication with PEVs is not possible. The
   method is useful in applications where fully centralized control is not
   possible, but where optimal or near-optimal charging patterns are
   essential to system operation.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{162-175}},

Abstract = {{Optimizing the final grinding production indices (GPIs), which include
   the product particle size and the grinding production rate, to meet the
   overall manufacturing performance requirements is the main function of
   automatic control of a grinding circuit (GC). However, the complex and
   time-varying nature of the GC process dictates that these GPIs cannot be
   optimized solely by the lower-level distributed control systems (DCS),
   therefore an operator is often incorporated to manually determine the
   set-points for the DCS using his/her operational experience. With a
   human being involved, the performance and even the safety and stability
   of the GC operation is subject to human errors. Focusing on this
   practical challenge, this paper proposes an intelligence-based
   supervisory control strategy that consists of a control loop set-point
   optimization module, an artificial neural network-based soft-sensor
   module, a fuzzy logic-based dynamic adjustor, and an expert-based
   overload diagnosis and adjustment module to perform the control tasks
   for the GC system. This hybrid system can automatically adjust the
   set-points for the DCS-controlled grinding system in response to the
   changes in boundary conditions or the imminent overload conditions,
   thereby eliminating the need for an operator. Practical applications
   have shown the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Pages = {{2091-2098}},
Abstract = {{In microfluidics, capillarity-driven solution flow is often beneficial,
   owing to its inherently spontaneous motion. However, it is commonly
   perceived that, in an integrated microfluidic system, the passive
   capillarity control alone can hardly achieve well-controlled sequential
   and parallel flow of multiple solutions. Despite this common notion, we
   hereby demonstrate system-level sequential and parallel microfluidic
   flow processing by fully passive capillarity-driven control. After
   manual loading of solutions with a pipette, a network of microfluidic
   channels passively regulates the flow timing of the multiple solution
   menisci in a sequential and synchronous manner. Also, use of auxiliary
   channels and preprogramming of inlet-well meniscus pressure and channel
   fluidic conductance allow for controlling the flow direction of multiple
   solutions in our microfluidic system. With those components orchestrated
   in a single device chip, we show preprogrammed flow control of 10
   solutions. The demonstrated system-level flow control proves capillarity
   as a useful means even for sophisticated microfluidic processing without
   any actively controlled valves and pumps.}},

Abstract = {{Microencapsulation and delivery of stem cells in biomaterials is a
   promising approach to repairing damaged tissue in a minimally invasive
   manner. An appropriate biomaterial niche can protect the embedded cells
   from the challenging environment in the host tissue, while also
   directing stem cell differentiation toward the desired lineage. In this
   study, adult human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were embedded in
   hydrogel microbeads consisting of chitosan and type I collagen using an
   emulsification process. Glyoxal and beta-glycerophosphate were used as
   chemical and physical crosslinkers to initiate copolymerization of the
   matrix materials. The average size and size distribution of the
   microbeads could be varied by controlling the emulsification conditions.
   Spheroidal microbeads ranging in diameter from 82 +/- 19 to 290 +/- 78
   mu m were produced. Viability staining showed that MSC survived the
   encapsulation process (>90\% viability) and spread inside the matrix
   over a period of 9 days in culture. Induced osteogenic differentiation
   using medium supplements showed that MSC increased gene expression of
   osterix and osteocalcin over time in culture, and also deposited calcium
   mineral. Bone sialoprotein and type I collagen gene expression were not
   affected. Delivery of microbeads through standard needles at practically
   relevant flow rates did not adversely affect cell viability, and
   microbeads could also be easily molded into prescribed geometries for
   delivery. Such protein-based microbeads may have utility in orthopedic
   tissue regeneration by allowing minimally invasive delivery of
   progenitor cells in microenvironments that are both protective and
   instructive. Copyright (c) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{This is the second paper in a series of two that describe our research
   in intelligent energy management in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). In
   the first paper, we presented the machine-learning framework
   ML\_EMO\_HEV, which was developed for learning the knowledge about
   energy optimization in an HEV. The framework consists of
   machine-learning algorithms for predicting driving environments and
   generating the optimal power split of the HEV system for a given driving
   environment. In this paper, we present the following three online
   intelligent energy controllers: 1) IEC\_HEV\_SISE; 2) IEC\_HEV\_MISE;
   and 3) IEC\_HEV\_MIME. All three online intelligent energy controllers
   were trained within the machine-learning framework ML\_EMO\_HEV to
   generate the best combination of engine power and battery power in real
   time such that the total fuel consumption over the whole driving cycle
   is minimized while still meeting the driver's demand and the system
   constraints, including engine, motor, battery, and generator operation
   limits. The three online controllers were integrated into the Ford
   Escape hybrid vehicle model for online performance evaluation. Based on
   their performances on ten test drive cycles provided by the Powertrain
   Systems Analysis Toolkit library, we can conclude that the roadway type
   and traffic congestion level specific machine learning of optimal energy
   management is effective for in-vehicle energy control. The best
   controller, IEC\_HEV\_MISE, trained with the optimal power split
   generated by the DP optimization algorithm with multiple initial SOC
   points and single ending point, can provide fuel savings ranging from
   5\% to 19\%. Together, these two papers cover the innovative
   technologies for modeling power flow, mathematical background of
   optimization in energy management, and machine-learning algorithms for
   generating intelligent energy controllers for quasioptimal energy flow
   in a power-split HEV.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates interdisciplinary interactions that take place
   during the research, development, and early conceptual design phases in
   the engineering of large-scale complex engineered systems (LaCES) such
   as aerospace vehicles. These interactions occur throughout a large
   engineering development organization and become the initial conditions
   of the systems engineering process that ultimately leads to the
   development of a viable system. This paper summarizes some of the
   challenges and opportunities regarding social and organizational issues
   that emerged from a qualitative study using ethnographic and survey
   data. The analysis reveals several socio-technical couplings between the
   engineered system and the organization that creates it. Survey
   respondents noted the importance of interdisciplinary interactions and
   their benefits to the engineered system as well as substantial
   challenges in interdisciplinary interactions. Noted benefits included
   enhanced knowledge and problem mitigation and noted obstacles centered
   on organizational and human dynamics. Findings suggest that addressing
   the social challenges may be a critical need in enabling
   interdisciplinary interactions during the development of LaCES. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Tungsten is one of the most promising materials for high temperature
   components in any future nuclear fusion tokamak. In this study
   tungsten-ion implantation has been used to simulate the damage caused by
   neutrons in pure tungsten and tungsten 5 wt\% rhenium. This damaged
   layer is only 300 nm deep so conventional mechanical tests cannot be
   used to investigate it. Nanoindentation has been used to measure the
   change in hardness as a function of six damage levels (0 dpa, 0.07 dpa,
   0.4 dpa, 1.2 dpa, 13 dpa and 33 dpa). In pure tungsten the hardness
   increase is seen to saturate by 0.4 dpa at approximate to 0.8 GPa.
   Transmission electron microscopy of the damage structure sees a similar
   saturation of the loop volume number density at the same damage level.
   In the tungsten 5 wt\% rhenium the increase in hardness is constant
   between 0.07 and 1.2 dpa, approximate to 0.85 GPa. The loop volume
   number density as measured using TEM is also shows little change in this
   region. At a damage level of 33 dpa the hardness increase is 2.88 GPa;
   this corresponds with the formation of small 3-5 nm rhenium clusters as
   observed using atom probe tomography. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{3114-3126}},
Abstract = {{Integration of nanoparticles (NPs) and other nanomaterials with existing
   technologies must take place in order to substantially widen the
   spectrum of their applications. This task can be simplified by taking
   advantage of NP assemblies provided that they retain the unique
   properties of nanomaterials in organized systems of larger dimensions.
   There is a large variety of methods of assembling NPs into
   superstructures containing 10-10(10) particles that include field-,
   bio-, and interface-directed techniques as well as self-organization.
   Some of them can traverse the scales from typical lengths of 10(-9) m
   (nano) to 10(-5) m (micro) and 10(1) m (macro) conducive to other
   technologies. Such dimensional transformation of nanomaterials makes
   possible utilization of well-established processing techniques, and
   hardware tools operating at these scales. Therefore, answering the
   question ``What types of the assembly techniques are suitable for such a
   task?{''} is vital for the future application of nanoscale materials in
   any field of use. These techniques must result in organized structures
   of at least 5 x 10(-7) m in size, offer relative simplicity and fault
   tolerance. This review focuses on the recent development of NP assembly
   techniques that have the possibility of satisfying these requirements.
   The expected applications and future developments are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Since time immemorial, surface water waves and their subsequent breaking
   have been studied. Herein we concentrate on breaking surface waves in
   deep and intermediate water depths. Progress has been made in several
   areas, including the prediction of their geometry, breaking onset, and
   especially energy dissipation. Recent progress in the study of geometric
   properties has evolved such that we can identify possible connections
   between crest geometry and energy dissipation and its rate. Onset
   prediction based on the local wave-energy growth rate appears robust,
   consistent with experiments, although the application of criteria in
   phase-resolving, deterministic prediction may be limited as calculation
   of the diagnostic parameter is nontrivial. Parameterization of the
   dissipation rate has benefited greatly from synergistic field and
   laboratory investigations, and relationships among the dynamics,
   kinematics, and the parameterization of the dynamics using geometric
   properties are now available. Field efforts continue, and although
   progress has been made, consensus among researchers is limited, in part
   because of the relatively few studies. Although direct numerical
   simulations of breaking waves are not yet a viable option, simpler
   models (e.g., implementation of an eddy viscosity model) have yielded
   positive results, particularly with regard to energy dissipation.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the potential to be used as an
   unlimited cell source for cell transplantation therapy, as well as for
   studying mechanisms of disease and early mammalian development. However,
   applications involving ESCs have been limited by the lack of reliable
   differentiation methods in many cases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
   have also emerged as a promising cell source, but as suggested in recent
   studies, these cells display limited potential for proliferation and
   differentiation, thereby limiting their usefulness in the clinic and in
   the laboratory. Unfortunately, effective methods for induction of MSCs
   from pluripotent stem cells have not been established, and the
   development of such methods remains a major challenge facing stem cell
   biologists. Oxygen concentration is one of the most important factors
   regulating tissue development. It has profound effects on cell
   metabolism and physiology and can strongly influence stem cell fate.
   Here we demonstrate that severe low O-2 concentrations (1\%) can
   function as a selective pressure for removing undifferentiated
   pluripotent cells during the induction of MSCs from rabbit ESCs (rESCs)
   and that MSCs induced under severe hypoxic conditions function as normal
   MSCs; that is, they repopulate after cloning, express specific markers
   (vimentin, CD29, CD90, CD 105, and CD140a) and differentiate into
   adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate
   that these cells can contribute to cartilage regeneration in an in vivo
   rabbit model for joint cartilage injury. These results support the
   notion that exposing ESCs to severe hypoxic conditions during
   differentiation can be used as a strategy for the preparation of
   functional MSCs from ESCs.}},

Abstract = {{Hypersonic flowfield and radiation analyses are performed before and
   after flight to study the physical conditions experienced by the
   automated transfer vehicle Jules Verne during reentry before breakup.
   Results are compared to those obtained with a miniature Echelle
   spectrograph operated from an airborne platform, measuring the flux
   density of atomic line emissions from oxygen and nitrogen, as well as
   many metals. Molecular emissions from CN and AIO are also detected. The
   vehicle lost its solar panels at 86 km and first broke up at 75 km. The
   main cargo cabin held together until 68 km. Postflight analyses focus on
   altitudes of 86, 75, and 68 km. A first analysis includes only air
   species, correctly predicting the observed oxygen and nitrogen atomic
   line intensities. N-2(+) band emission is systematically overestimated
   by at least a factor of 20, indicating a need for revision of the
   radiation model for this system. A second analysis includes blowing of
   metals (aluminum, sodium, potassium, and magnesium) from the vehicle
   surface. The blowing rates are inferred by requiring the computed and
   measured emissions to match. Magnesium and aluminum originate from
   ablation of structural elements, while sodium and potassium may have
   originated as impurities in paint.}},

Abstract = {{We present experiments and theory of a constant flow-driven microfluidic
   oscillator with widely tunable oscillation periods. This oscillator
   converts two constant input-flows from a syringe pump into an
   alternating, periodic output-flow with oscillation periods that can be
   adjusted to between 0.3 s to 4.1 h by tuning an external membrane
   capacitor. This capacitor allows multiple adjustable periods at a given
   input flow-rate, thus providing great flexibility in device operation.
   Also, we show that a sufficiently large external capacitance, relative
   to the internal capacitance of the microfluidic valve itself, is a
   critical requirement for oscillation. These widely tunable microfluidic
   oscillators are envisioned to be broadly useful for the study of
   biological rhythms, as on-chip timing sources for microfluidic logic
   circuits, and other applications that require variation in timed flow
   switching.}},

   carbon nanotube growth}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2928-2937}},
Abstract = {{Aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) structures are promising for many
   applications; however, as-grown CNT ``forests{''} synthesized by
   chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are typically low-density and mostly
   comprise tortuous defective CNTs. Here, we present evidence that the
   density and alignment of self-organized CNT growth is limited by
   mechanical coupling among CNTs in contact, in combination with their
   diameter-dependent growth rates. This study is enabled by comprehensive
   X-ray characterization of the spatially and temporally-varying internal
   morphology of CNT forests. Based on this data, we model the time
   evolution and diameter-dependent scaling of the ensuing mechanical
   forces on catalyst nanoparticles during CNT growth, which arise from the
   mismatch between the collective lengthening rate of the forest and the
   diameter-dependent growth rates of individual CNTs. In addition to
   enabling self-organization of CNTs into forests, time-varying forces
   between CNTs in contact dictate the hierarchical tortuous morphology of
   CNT forests, and may be sufficient to influence the structural quality
   of CNTs. These forces reach a maximum that is coincident with the
   maximum density observed in our growth process, and are proportional to
   CNT diameter. Therefore, we propose that improved manufacturing
   strategies for self-organized CNTs should consider both chemical and
   mechanical effects. This may be especially necessary to achieve high
   density CNT forests with low defect density, such as for improved
   thermal interfaces and high-permeability membranes.}},

Abstract = {{The seventh U.S.Japan Joint Seminar on Nanoscale Transport Phenomena was
   held in Shima, Japan, from December 11 to 14, 2011. The goals of this
   joint seminar were to provide a critical assessment of the state of the
   art and future directions in the field of nanoscale transport phenomena
   and energy conversion processes, to foster U.S.Japan collaborations, and
   to provide international exposure to a new generation of scientists in
   this field. Issues discussed in the joint seminar were organized in 10
   topical sessions, including (1) nanoscale thermophysical measurements;
   (2) optical characterization; (3) thermal and molecular transport; (4)
   phonon transport modeling; (5) energy storage and conversion; (6)
   nanoscale fluidics and phase change phenomena; (7) biological and
   organic systems; (8) interfacial thermal transport; (9) novel
   thermoelectric and thermal management materials; and (10) nanocarbon
   materials and devices. In addition to these topical sessions, the joint
   seminar featured an opening plenary session and a closing plenary
   session as well as an expert panel, where leading experts provided
   critical assessment of the past progress and addressed future directions
   in the field. In addition, an evening poster session provided
   opportunities for graduate and postdoc students to present their latest
   research results. About 35 researchers from Japan and 31 researchers
   from the United States participated in the meeting. The meeting was
   organized by S. Maruyama, K. Fushinobu, L. Shi, and J. Lukes together
   with about 20 other participants who served as session chairs. Summaries
   of different sessions of the seminar were prepared by the session and
   conference chairs and are collected into this report.}},

Abstract = {{Small molecule competition experiments were performed to determine
   whether Ni-catalyzed Kumada cross-coupling reactions proceed through an
   intramolecular oxidative addition. Indeed, preferential intramolecular
   oxidative addition was observed for all four complexes when
   stoichiometric quantities of competitive agent were present. At higher
   concentrations of competitive agent, the intramolecular pathway was
   still preferred when bidentate, electron-rich ligands were utilized,
   suggesting that these ligands promote the formation and reactivity of
   the key intermediate. To determine whether a similar pathway is involved
   in the polymerizations, (4-bromo-2,5-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl)magnesium
   bromide was polymerized in the presence and absence of competitive
   agent. The number-average molecular weights were lower and the molecular
   weight distributions were broadened substantially when competitive agent
   was present, consistent with the presence of competing intermolecular
   pathways. Because bidentate, electron-rich ligands suppressed these
   undesired intermolecular reactions, these ligands should lead to

Title = {{Thermodynamic screening of metal-substituted MOFs for carbon capture}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{4573-4581}},
Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising materials for
   carbon capture applications due to their high CO2 capacities and tunable
   properties. Amongst the many possible MOFs, metal-substituted compounds
   based on M-DOBDC and M-HKUST-1 have demonstrated amongst the highest CO2
   capacities at the low pressures typical of flue gasses. Here we explore
   the possibility for additional performance tuning of these compounds by
   computationally screening 36 metal-substituted variants (M = Be, Mg, Ca,
   Sr, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, W, Sn, and Pb) with
   respect to their CO2 adsorption enthalpy, Delta H-T=300K. Supercell
   calculations based on van der Waals density functional theory (vdW-DF)
   yield enthalpies in good agreement with experimental measurements,
   out-performing semi-empirical (DFT-D2) and conventional (LDA \& GGA)
   functionals. Our screening identifies 13 compounds having Delta H values
   within the targeted thermodynamic window -40 <= Delta H <= -75 kJ
   mol(-1): 8 are based on M-DODBC (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Sc, Ti, V, Mo, and W),
   and 5 on M-HKUST-1 (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Sr and Sc). Variations in the
   electronic structure and the geometry of the structural building unit
   are examined and used to rationalize trends in CO2 affinity. In
   particular, the partial charge on the coordinatively unsaturated metal
   sites is found to correlate with Delta H, suggesting that this property
   may be used as a simple performance descriptor. The ability to rapidly
   distinguish promising MOFs from those that are ``thermodynamic
   dead-ends{''} will be helpful in guiding synthesis efforts towards
   promising compounds.}},

Abstract = {{If elastic systems with frictional interfaces are subjected to periodic
   loading, the system may shake down, meaning that frictional slip is
   restricted to the first few cycles, or it may settle into a steady
   periodic state involving cyclic slip. Furthermore, if the system
   posesses a rigid-body mode, the slip may also cause an increment of
   rigid-body motion to occur during each cycle a phenomenon known as
   ratcheting.
   Here we investigate this behaviour for discrete systems such as finite
   element models, for which the contact state can be described in terms of
   a finite set of nodal displacements and forces. If the system is
   `uncoupled - i.e. if the stiffness matrix is such that the tangential
   nodal displacements are uninfluenced by the normal nodal forces, a
   frictional Melan's theorem can be proved showing that shakedown will
   occur for all initial conditions if there exists a safe shakedown state
   for the periodic loading in question. For coupled systems, we develop an
   algorithm for determining the range of periodic load amplitudes within
   which the long-time state might be cyclic slip or shakedown, depending
   on the initial condition. The problem is investigated using a geometric
   representation of the motion of the frictional inequality constraints in
   slip displacement space. Similar techniques are used to explore
   ratcheting behaviour in a low-order system.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{357-379}},
Abstract = {{We consider the classical matroid matching problem. Unweighted matroid
   matching for linearly represented matroids was solved by Lovasz, and the
   problem is known to be intractable for general matroids. We present a
   polynomial-time approximation scheme for unweighted matroid matching for
   general matroids. In contrast, we show that natural linear-programming
   relaxations that have been studied have an Omega(n) integrality gap,
   and, moreover, Omega(n) rounds of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy are
   necessary to bring the gap down to a constant. More generally, for any
   fixed k >= 2 and epsilon > 0, we obtain a (k/2+ epsilon)-approximation
   for matroid matching in k-uniform hypergraphs, also known as the matroid
   k-parity problem. As a consequence, we obtain a (k/2+
   epsilon)-approximation for the problem of finding the
   maximum-cardinality set in the intersection of k matroids. We also give
   a 3/2-approximation for the weighted version of a special case of
   matroid matching, the matchoid problem.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel(II) complexes with varying reactive ligands, which were designed
   to selectively accelerate the initiation rate without influencing the
   propagation rate in the chain-growth polymerization of p-conjugated
   monomers, were investigated. Precatalysts with electronically varied
   reacting groups led to faster initiation rates and narrower molecular
   weight distributions. Computational studies revealed that the reductive
   elimination rates are largely modulated by the ability of the two
   reacting arenes to stabilize the increasing electron density on the
   catalyst during reductive elimination. Overall, these studies provide
   insight into a key mechanistic step of cross-coupling reactions
   (reductive elimination) and highlight the importance of initiation in
   controlled chain-growth polymerizations.}},

Abstract = {{The development of modern biomedical nanotechnology requires conductive
   polymeric nanofibers with excellent mechanical and biocompatible
   properties to meet the needs of practical applications in complex
   biological systems. In the study, we developed a novel facile method to
   fabricate poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanofiber mats by
   electrospinning combined with in situ interfacial polymerization. The
   PEDOT nanofiber mats displayed superior mechanical properties (tensile
   strength: 8.7 +/- 0.4 MPa; Young's modulus: 28.4 +/- 3.3 MPa) and
   flexibility, which can almost be restored to its original shape even
   after serious twisting and crimping. Especially, from the results of the
   cellular morphology and proliferation of human cancer stem cells (hCSCs)
   cultured on the PEDOT nanofiber mats for 3 days, evidence was provided
   that the PEDOT nanofiber mats have similar biocompatibility to tissue
   culture plates (TCPs). Combined with an outstanding electrical
   conductivity of 7.8 +/- 0.4 S cm(-1), these excellent mechanical and
   biocompatible properties make the PEDOT nanofiber mats promising
   candidates in biotechnology applications, such as electroactive
   substrates/scaffolds for tissue engineering, drug delivery, cell
   culture, and implanted electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Surfaces coated with nanoscale filaments such as silicon nanowires and
   carbon nanotubes are potentially compelling for high-performance battery
   and capacitor electrodes, photovoltaics, electrical interconnects,
   substrates for engineered cell growth, dry adhesives, and other smart
   materials. However, many of these applications require a wet environment
   or involve wet processing during their synthesis. The capillary forces
   introduced by these wet environments can lead to undesirable aggregation
   of nanoscale filaments, but control of capillary forces can enable
   manipulation of the filaments into discrete aggregates and novel
   hierarchical structures. Recent studies suggest that the elastocapillary
   self-assembly of nanofilaments can be a versatile and scalable means to
   build complex and robust surface architectures. To enable a wider
   understanding and use of elastocapillary self-assembly as a fabrication
   technology, we give an overview of the underlying fundamentals and
   classify typical implementations and surface designs for nanowires,
   nanotubes, and nanopillars made from a wide variety of materials.
   Finally, we discuss exemplary applications and future opportunities to
   realize new engineered surfaces by the elastocapillary self-assembly of

Abstract = {{Research on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has expanded rapidly
   over the last two decades, owing to the promises of hPSCs for
   applications in regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and
   developmental biology studies. While most studies of hPSCs have so far
   focused on identifying extrinsic soluble factors, intracellular
   signaling pathways, and transcriptional networks that are involved in
   regulating hPSC self-renewal and differentiation, a few promising
   studies have emerged in recent years to reveal some unique
   mechano-sensitive and -responsive properties of hPSCs and the effect of
   the physical aspects of the local cellular microenvironment on
   regulating hPSC behaviors. This Frontier Review is to highlight these
   recent studies of mechanobiology in hPSCs and to discuss the impact of
   advancing our understanding of mechanoregulation of hPSC behaviors on
   improving survival, self-renewal and differentiation of hPSCs using
   well-controlled synthetic micro/nanoscale cell culture tools.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced scaffold materials are required for liver tissue engineering,
   to improve primary hepatocyte activity and hepatic function in vitro.
   The nanotopography of the scaffold material plays an important role in
   the regulation of cell growth and function. Therefore, in the current
   study, we developed a novel scaffold composed of type-I collagen coated
   nanoporous poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) fibers (nPFs) to provide a
   nanotopography with a combination of fibrous and porous features for the
   culture of primary hepatocytes. The interaction between the
   nanotopography and the hepatocytes was described by testing cell
   morphology, retention, activity and hepatic function over a 15 day
   culture period. Primary hepatocytes cultured on the nPFs formed
   large-area stable immobilized monolayers after 3 days of culture, and
   displayed excellent cell bioactivity with higher levels of
   liver-specific function maintenance, in terms of albumin secretion, urea
   synthesis, and CYP1A and UGT enzymatic activity, than those cultured on
   type-I collagen coated non-porous PLLA fibers (Fs). These results
   indicate that the combined fibrous and porous nanotopography of nPFs has
   a superior promoting effect on primary hepatocyte culture compared to
   the non-porous fibrous nanotopography of Fs. The nPFs may be a suitable
   material for liver tissue engineering research and potential therapeutic
   applications, such as in bioartificial liver devices, and as a substrate
   for primary hepatocyte culture.}},

Pages = {{3412-3423}},
Abstract = {{A computational model is developed to study the manufacturing of
   micro/nanostructures by electrohydrodynamic (EHD) patterning processes.
   The computational methodology is based on the iterative coupling of the
   discontinuous boundary element method for electric field with the finite
   element method for free surface deformation. The model is capable of
   modeling fully nonlinear free surface deformations induced by an
   electric field. Geometric discontinuity resulting from the contact of
   the liquid film with the template is fully accounted for by introducing
   the short-range molecular forces. The critical voltage for liquid film
   instability is found by tracing the asymptote of the structural height
   vs. applied voltage curve, followed by a confirmation by the existence
   of an internal minimum of the total free energy. Computer codes are
   verified using the analytical solutions and available measurements. An
   important finding from the numerical simulations is that steady state
   structures can be electrohydrodynamically patterned when the applied
   voltage is either below or above a critical value. While linear analyses
   are useful, they may significantly over-predict the critical voltage, a
   crucial parameter for an EHD patterning process. The highly nonlinear
   phenomena of wetting the template above the critical voltage were
   considered to be unstable within the framework of linear perturbation.
   However, these phenomena can be very well predicted by the nonlinear
   boundary/finite element model enhanced by the short-range molecular
   forces. Finally, the computational model is flexible and may be modified
   with ease to analyze an EHD-patterning process for an
   air-polymer-polymer tri-layered system or other multiple-layered films
   for fabricating more complex nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{A stagnation-point flow reactor was used to study the catalytic activity
   of platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), tin dioxide (SnO2), and 90\% SnO2-10\%
   Pt (by mass) to premixed propane and air reactants at atmospheric
   pressure. The Pt and Pd catalysts served as the baseline by which to
   compare catalyst performance. The stagnation surface temperature was
   controlled to maintain constant temperatures using an electric heater in
   order to eliminate heat transfer effects on catalyst performance. The
   activity of each catalyst was evaluated for catalyst stagnation surface
   temperatures ranging from 300 degrees C to 800 degrees C. Three fuel-air
   equivalence-ratio conditions were studied (phi = 0.67, 1.0 and 1.5). The
   CO2, CO, O-2, and C3H8 in the exhaust gases were measured to quantify
   the activity of each catalyst. The effect of heat released by surface
   reaction was quantified by the heater power required to stabilize the
   stagnation plane at the prescribed temperature. The catalysts, excluding
   100\% SnO2, exhibited comparable trends with respect to propane
   oxidation as a function of stagnation-plane temperature. While 100\%
   SnO2 showed no catalytic activity at any conditions, the 90\% SnO2-10\%
   Pt catalyst showed significant activity to propane oxidation. The lowest
   catalyst activation temperature of the experiments (T-surface = 250
   degrees C) was observed for the 90\% SnO2-10\% Pt catalyst for phi =
   1.5. The results demonstrate potential of Pt/SnO2 as a fuel oxidation

Abstract = {{Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic bone dysplasia characterized
   by osteopenia and easy susceptibility to fracture. Symptoms are most
   prominent during childhood. Although antiresorptive bisphosphonates have
   been widely used to treat pediatric OI, controlled trials show improved
   vertebral parameters but equivocal effects on long-bone fracture rates.
   New treatments for OI are needed to increase bone mass throughout the
   skeleton. Sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) therapy is potently anabolic in
   the skeleton by stimulating osteoblasts via the canonical wnt signaling
   pathway, and may be beneficial for treating OI. In this study, Scl-Ab
   therapy was investigated in mice heterozygous for a typical OI-causing
   Gly -> Cys substitution in col1a1. Two weeks of Scl-Ab successfully
   stimulated osteoblast bone formation in a knock-in model for moderately
   severe OI (Brtl/+) and in WT mice, leading to improved bone mass and
   reduced long-bone fragility. Image-guided nanoindentation revealed no
   alteration in local tissue mineralization dynamics with Scl-Ab. These
   results contrast with previous findings of antiresorptive efficacy in OI
   both in mechanism and potency of effects on fragility. In conclusion,
   short-term Scl-Ab was successfully anabolic in osteoblasts harboring a
   typical OI-causing collagen mutation and represents a potential new
   therapy to improve bone mass and reduce fractures in pediatric OI. (C)

Abstract = {{With the difficulty and cost of full-scale flight experiments, the
   design of scramjet engines relies heavily on computational simulations.
   Radiation may play an important role in the wall heating and flow
   cooling of scramjets. However, very few studies have focused on such.
   The present analysis is based on three-dimensional turbulent reacting
   flow simulations of the HyShot II hydrogen fueled scramjet engine
   running at flight conditions of Mach 7.4. A three-dimensional discrete
   ordinates method analysis with a narrowband averaged spectral model is
   employed to determine wall heating and flow cooling from thermal
   radiation. The discrete ordinates method is verified against a
   three-dimensional ray tracing method. The radiative species considered
   are H2O and OH. The radiative heat flux is on the order of 10 kW/m(2),
   which is 0.1-0.6\% of the total convective wall heat flux. Flow cooling
   due to radiation is found to be on the order of 3 K. Sensitivity
   analysis shows that radiation is highly dependent on chamber size,
   temperature, pressure, and radiative species mole fraction. Variations
   in these factors can explain the differences between previous analyses
   in the literature that studied hypothetical engines and the current work
   that models an existing scramjet.}},

Abstract = {{Active safety features and adjustments to the New Car Assessment Program
   (NCAP) consumer-information crash tests have the potential to decrease
   the number of serious traffic injuries each year, according to previous
   studies. However, literature suggests that risk reductions, particularly
   in the automotive market, are often accompanied by adjusted consumer
   risk tolerance, and so these potential safety benefits may not be fully
   realized due to changes in consumer purchasing or driving behavior. This
   article approaches safety in the new vehicle market, particularly in the
   Sport Utility Vehicle and Crossover Utility Vehicle segments, from a
   market systems perspective. Crash statistics and simulations are used to
   predict the effects of design and policy changes on occupant crash
   safety, and discrete choice experiments are conducted to estimate the
   values consumers place on vehicle attributes. These models are combined
   in a market simulation that forecasts how consumers respond to the
   available vehicle alternatives, resulting in predictions of the market
   share of each vehicle and how the change in fleet mixture influences
   societal outcomes including injuries, fuel consumption, and firm
   profits. The model is tested for a scenario where active safety features
   are implemented across the new vehicle fleet and a scenario where the
   U.S. frontal NCAP test speed is modified. While results exhibit evidence
   of consumer risk adjustment, they support adding active safety features
   and lowering the NCAP frontal test speed, as these changes are predicted
   to improve the welfare of both firms and society. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Vancomycin represents the preferred ligand for bacteria-targeting
   nanosystems. However, it is inefficient for emerging
   vancomycin-resistant species because of its poor affinity to the
   reprogrammed cell wall structure. This study demonstrates the use of a
   multivalent strategy as an effective way for overcoming such an affinity
   limitation in bacteria targeting. We designed a series of fifth
   generation (G5) poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers tethered with
   vancomycin at the C-terminus at different valencies. We performed
   surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies to determine their binding
   avidity to two cell wall models, each made with either a
   vancomycin-susceptible (D)-Ala-(D)-Ala or vancomycin-resistant
   (D)-Ala-(D)-Lac cell wall precursor. These conjugates showed remarkable
   enhancement in avidity in the cell wall models tested, Including the
   vancomycin-resistant model, which had an increase in avidity of four to
   five orders of magnitude greater than free vancomycin. The tight
   adsorption of the conjugate to the model surface corresponded with Its
   ability to bind vancomycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacterial
   cells in vitro as imaged by confocal fluorescent microscopy. This
   vancomycin platform was then used to fabricate the surface of iron oxide
   nanoparticles by coating them with the dendrimer conjugates, and the
   resulting dendrimer-covered magnetic nanoparticles were demonstrated to
   rapidly sequester bacterial cells. In summary, this article investigates
   the biophysical basis of the tight, multivalent association of
   dendrimer-based vancomycin conjugates to the bacterial cell wall, and
   proposes a potential new use of this nanoplatform in targeting
   Gram-positive bacteria.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{818-825}},
Abstract = {{We developed a novel smart multi-channel two-dimensional (2-D) micro-gas
   chromatography (mu GC) architecture that shows promise to significantly
   improve 2-D mu GC performance. In the smart mu GC design, a
   non-destructive on-column gas detector and a flow routing system are
   installed between the first dimensional separation column and multiple
   second dimensional separation columns. The effluent from the first
   dimensional column is monitored in real-time and decision is then made
   to route the effluent to one of the second dimensional columns for
   further separation. As compared to the conventional 2-D mu GC, the
   greatest benefit of the smart multi-channel 2-D mu GC architecture is
   the enhanced separation capability of the second dimensional column and
   hence the overall 2-D GC performance. All the second dimensional columns
   are independent of each other, and their coating, length, flow rate and
   temperature can be customized for best separation results. In
   particular, there is no more constraint on the upper limit of the second
   dimensional column length and separation time in our architecture. Such
   flexibility is critical when long second dimensional separation is
   needed for optimal gas analysis. In addition, the smart mu GC is
   advantageous in terms of elimination of the power intensive thermal
   modulator, higher peak amplitude enhancement, simplified 2-D
   chromatogram re-construction and potential scalability to higher
   dimensional separation. In this paper, we first constructed a complete
   smart 1 x 2 channel 2-D mu GC system, along with an algorithm for
   automated control/operation of the system. We then characterized and
   optimized this mu GC system, and finally employed it in two important
   applications that highlight its uniqueness and advantages, i.e.,
   analysis of 31 workplace hazardous volatile organic compounds, and rapid
   detection and identification of target gas analytes from interference
   background.}},

   sensor-based gas chromatography (GC) of mixtures of volatile organic

   ``microfabricated passive preconcentrator/injector (mu PPI){''}.
   Comprehensive analysis of the sampling, desorption/injection, and
   compound separation performance of the mu PPI-based optofluidic GC
   system is described. Here, the combined use of the mu PPI and on-column
   FP cavity sensors in a common GC platform enabled diffusion-based
   passive sampling, rapid (<7 min) chromatographic separation, and optical
   detection for the quaternary VOC mixtures of benzene, TCE, toluene, and
   m-xylene at sub-ppm concentrations with a simpler fluidic setup than
   conventional GC systems. The FP cavity sensor arrangement provided the
   means to study the dynamics of the thermal desorption/injection of VOCs
   by the mu PPI and its effect on the GC separation resolution. Our
   analysis of obtained chromatograms revealed a presence of the
   competitive adsorptions of VOC mixtures onto the adsorption sites of
   trapping materials in the mu PPI, which decreased the effective sampling
   rate by similar to 50\% for compounds with high volatility. The
   validated performance of the optofluidic GC system promises future
   development of a field deployable GC microsystem incorporating the mu
   PPI and the FP cavity sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Developing three-dimensional space and system arrangements is a
   challenging and time-consuming task because ship layouts include
   hundreds or thousands of elements with multiple interconnections and
   dependencies governed by functional characteristics. Existing automated
   arrangements tools aimed at early-stage design are capable of generating
   feasible layouts, but remain a bit of a ``black box,{''} lacking methods
   to elucidate the mechanisms that drive or limit the quality of those
   layouts. By knowing which items drive or constrain an arrangement,
   designers can more judiciously decide when and where to position
   objects. Methods that provide this information are particularly valuable
   for novel ship types, designs containing emerging technologies, or
   densely outfitted vessels such as naval combatants and submersibles. The
   use of networks to represent the interconnections allows designers to
   focus on the underlying relationships input into the system rather than
   just the resultant layouts. The authors use the complex network measures
   of centrality and hierarchy to identify layout drivers based solely on
   the relationships among the spaces to be arranged. Moreover, the methods
   are shown to permit identification of drivers without ever creating
   geometric arrangements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of organic optoelectronic devices depends a lot on
   interface structure and width. Dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry
   (SIMS) has been widely used to investigate interfaces in classical
   semiconductor devices and limitations are quite well understood. For
   low-energy dynamic SIMS on organic optoelectronic devices,
   sputter-induced diffusion processes and roughness formation have only
   been investigated sparsely. In this work we use low-energy dynamic SIMS
   depth profiling on metal organic multilayered model samples with
   compositions similar to organic optoelectronic devices to investigate
   limitations in the calculation of interface widths due to
   sputter-induced roughness formation. The samples consist of silver and
   organic compounds (e.g., tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato) aluminum (Alq(3))
   and metal phthalocyanines) sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation
   in vacuum onto a Si substrate. They are analyzed by a 500 eV Cs+ primary
   ion beam. Surface roughness at the SIMS crater bottoms is characterized
   by AFM as a function of crater depth. We find that the roughness in SIMS
   craters is limited to approximately 1.5 nm, which is much smaller than
   the interface width of the as-deposited interfaces. Thus, for the
   studied organic-inorganic interfaces, low-energy dynamic SIMS can yield
   accurate information about interface morphology, allowing the study of
   its dependence on sample preparation conditions and its implication on
   device properties.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the large-signal performance of intrinsically
   switchable ferroelectric thin-film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs), as
   well as their modeling procedure. There has been a growing interest in
   ferroelectric FBARs due to their electric-field-dependent permittivity
   and electric-field-induced piezoelectricity. Ferroelectric
   barium-strontium-titanate (Ba infinity Sr(1-infinity)TiO3) FBARs are
   intrinsically switchable, namely, they have resonances that switch on
   with the application of a dc-bias voltage. In this paper, the
   large-signal performance and nonlinear behavior of ferroelectric BST
   FBARs are investigated. Measurement results show that the device
   nonlinearity can be reduced by applying higher dc-bias voltages.
   Moreover, a large-signal model that accurately describes the dc-bias
   voltage, as well as RF power-dependent performance of BST FBARs is
   developed. Large-signal simulation results obtained from this model at
   different bias voltages and RF power levels show good agreement with the
   measurement results.}},

Title = {{Manual movement coordination adapted to spinal cord injury and low back
   pain}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Spinal cord injury (SCI) and low back pain (LBP) significantly limit
   personal and occupational activities. Since upper body movements are
   crucial to extend hand reach envelopes and maintain postural balance,
   coordinated control of torso and hand movements is essential. In this
   study, adapted patterns of coordination were investigated in SCI, LBP
   and control participants performing seated manual material handling
   tasks, in which a load was transferred with both hands from a home
   location to one of 4 targets in the mid-sagittal plane.
   Torso peak velocities are larger and delayed for the SCI when compared
   to the control group, while hand peak velocities are comparable.
   However, hand peak velocities are smaller in the LBP than control group.
   Hand movements generally precede torso movements for all groups, but
   more prominently for the SCI than the other groups. Furthermore, for
   SCIs torso movements were suppressed until the hands were aligned with
   target elevation.
   These results indicate that SCI individuals have developed a unique
   coordination pattern to compensate for their limited balance control,
   although this strategy may reduce their effective workspace and overload
   the upper extremities. In contrast, LBPs seem to have reduced movement
   speed while their coordination patterns are generally similar to those
   in the control group.
   Relevance to industry: This study analyzed movements of persons with
   spinal cord injury or low back pain in manual material handling tasks.
   Assessing their adapted movement strategies would help to improve
   workspace design to accommodate workers with limited capacities and to
   provide quantifiable evidence and guidelines on the effectiveness of
   occupational rehabilitation programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   upgrading of biocrude resulting from noncatalytic liquefaction and the
   stability and degradation of catalysts in high temperature water are

Abstract = {{A new research platform, the Air Traffic Monotonic Lagrangian Grid, has
   been developed to serve as a simulation tool for easy and fast testing
   of various air traffic system concepts. The underlying algorithm is the
   Monotonic Lagrangian Grid, which is a fast nearest-neighbors interaction
   algorithm used for sorting and tracking many moving and interacting
   objects. The nodes of the Monotonic Lagrangian Grid represent the
   locations of individual aircraft, and the grid moves at each time step
   as the aircraft move. The model is used to simulate a 24 h period of air
   traffic flow in the National Airspace System, during which there are
   41,594 flights, and this requires only 79 s of wall-clock time on a
   single processor of a 1.3 GHz Altix. An analysis is presented of the
   number of nearest-neighbor nodes that must be checked to ensure adequate
   separation among aircraft. An investigation of the effect of removing
   waypoints from aircraft trajectories indicates that this may result in a
   significant reduction in total flight time. Finally, the model is
   compared with the traditional Latitude - Longitude grid approach, in
   which the airspace volume is partitioned into fixed stationary grid
   cells. Results of the comparison indicate that the main advantage of the
   Monotonic Lagrangian Grid method is that it is a general sorting
   algorithm that can sort on multiple properties, providing more
   computational efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Compliant mechanisms with evenly distributed stresses have better

   demonstrated for both single-port mechanisms and single-input
   single-output mechanisms. It is observed that the optimized designs have
   lower stresses than their nonoptimized counterparts, which implies an
   ability for single-port mechanisms to store larger strain energy, and

   that occurs as the downstream boundary condition abruptly changes when
   the flow becomes unchoked. Transition was studied in three ways; as a
   quasi-steady phenomenon due to slow decreases in fuel flow rate, or as
   caused by rapid variations in either fuel flow rate or test-section wall
   temperature. A regime diagram was constructed that plots the measured
   ram-scram transition boundary. Under certain conditions some periodic
   low-frequency oscillations of the flame position occur and they are
   shown to be correlated with oscillations of the upstream precombustion
   pseudoshock. A self-sustaining shear-layer instability, associated with
   the flameholding cavity, is believed to be the mechanism causing this
   behavior. The relevant time scales associated with the ram-scram
   transition and the flame-shock interactions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Indole is commonly reported as a product from hydrothermal processing of
   algal biomass. The reactions of indole in supercritical water were
   investigated between 550 and 700 degrees C in quartz, mini-batch
   reactors. The indole disappearance rate followed first-order kinetics,
   and the activation energy was 155 +/- 10 kJ/mol. Methane and hydrogen
   were the most abundant gaseous products under most of the conditions
   tested, whereas benzene was the most abundant liquid-phase product.
   Hydrogen and carbon gasification efficiencies (HGE and CGE) exhibited
   values up to 79\% and 20\%, respectively. The influence of water density
   on the yields of H-2, CH4, and C2H6 was negligible at densities above
   0.081 g/ml, but the CO2 yield increased with water density whereas the
   CO yield decreased. The yield of CH4 increased significantly as the
   initial indole concentration increased. The collective results, which
   showed how the yields of numerous intermediate reaction products
   responded to changes in the process variables, permitted advancement of
   a potential reaction network. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of diagnosing the occurrence of a certain

   assumed that certain sensors for events that would a priori be
   observable may fail at the outset, thereby resulting in a loss of
   observable events; the diagnostic engine is not directly aware of such
   sensor failures. We explore a previous definition of robust
   diagnosability of a given fault event despite the possibility of
   permanent (and unknown a priori) loss of observations and present a
   polynomial time verification algorithm to verify robust diagnosability
   and a methodology to perform online diagnosis in this scenario using a

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel method for scavenging energy for electric
   power systems sensing applications by the use of permanent magnets that
   couple to the magnetic field generated by an alternating current flowing
   through a nearby conductor. The resulting mechanical energy is converted
   to electrical energy using piezoelectric transduction. This
   electromechanical AC energy scavenging method is an attractive
   alternative to coil-based AC energy scavengers in cases where the
   scavengers cannot encircle the conductor. In such cases, the
   electromechanical AC energy scavenger has the potential to produce
   significantly more power than comparable coil-based methods. The
   components of an electromechanical AC energy scavenger are described in
   detail, and experimental data from prototypes that are fabricated and
   tested in our laboratory are shown. The 20 cm(3) prototypes generated up
   to 2.7 mW of power each from 20 A of nearby current. Theoretical power
   densities of electromechanical AC energy scavengers are compared to the
   power densities of representative coil-based methods, showing that in
   some cases the electromechanical AC scavengers can generate an
   order-of-magnitude more power than coil-based AC scavengers. This paper
   demonstrates that electromechanical AC energy scavenging is a potential
   method for powering small size low cost stick-on wireless sensor
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{The Canadian Experiment for Soil Moisture in 2010 (CanEx-SM10) was
   carried out in Saskatchewan, Canada, from 31 May to 16 June, 2010. Its
   main objective was to contribute to Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
   (SMOS) mission validation and the prelaunch assessment of the proposed
   Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission. During CanEx-SM10, SMOS
   data as well as other passive and active microwave measurements were
   collected by both airborne and satellite platforms. Ground-based
   measurements of soil (moisture, temperature, roughness, bulk density)
   and vegetation characteristics (leaf area index, biomass, vegetation
   height) were conducted close in time to the airborne and satellite
   acquisitions. Moreover, two ground-based in situ networks provided
   continuous measurements of meteorological conditions and soil moisture
   and soil temperature profiles. Two sites, each covering 33 km x 71 km
   (about two SMOS pixels) were selected in agricultural and boreal
   forested areas in order to provide contrasting soil and vegetation
   conditions. This paper describes the measurement strategy, provides an
   overview of the data sets, and presents preliminary results. Over the
   agricultural area, the airborne L-band brightness temperatures matched
   up well with the SMOS data (prototype 346). The radio frequency
   interference observed in both SMOS and the airborne L-band radiometer
   data exhibited spatial and temporal variability and polarization
   dependency. The temporal evolution of the SMOS soil moisture product
   (prototype 307) matched that observed with the ground data, but the
   absolute soil moisture estimates did not meet the accuracy requirements
   (0.04 m(3)/m(3)) of the SMOS mission. AMSR-E soil moisture estimates
   from the National Snow and Ice Data Center more closely reflected soil
   moisture measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple circuit for balancing series-connected
   battery cells. The circuit is composed of one low-voltage
   metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) for each cell
   and a symmetrical multiwinding transformer for a group of cells. Only
   one control signal is needed for all MOSFETs, and energy can be directly
   transferred from higher voltage cells to lower voltage cells. A small
   capacitor is added to form a resonant circuit with the transformer
   magnetizing inductance so that soft switching can be achieved in some
   operation range to obtain high efficiency. The circuit balance function
   and soft-switching condition are analyzed and verified by simulation and
   experiments. A circuit for balancing a 4- and 12-cell battery group is
   tested. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the
   circuit. The energy transfer efficiency between cells can reach up to
   93\%. The circuit can be easily scaled to battery strings containing up
   to 12 battery cells, directly applicable to consumer electronics
   application where the number of cells is typically less than 12. A
   battery pack containing a large number of battery cells, such as the
   ones used in electric vehicles, can be balanced in groups, for example,
   in modules containing 12 cells each and with one additional circuit to
   balance among the modules.}},

Abstract = {{While unbonded concrete and hot mixture asphalt overlays have been
   commonly used for concrete pavement rehabilitation, cracking due to
   stress concentration still limits the service life of pavement overlays.
   The use of ductile concrete such as Engineered Cementitious Composite
   (ECC) should suppress this brittle fracture at the base of the overlay
   due to existing crack/joint. Therefore, enhancement of long term
   performance of the overlaid pavements can be expected. Herein we
   introduce and study the feasibility of this concept via integration of
   ECC flexural fatigue behavior and finite element analysis for overlaid
   pavement. The integration results in a service life model for pavement
   overlays, which was then employed in a life cycle assessment model to
   reveal the sustainability performance of different overlays. Analysis
   results suggest that ECC can greatly extend the service life of pavement
   overlay with less thickness compared with concrete overlay, resulting in
   a more sustainable overlay. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the concept and design of a multifunctional
   composite sandwich structure for simultaneous energy harvesting and
   vibration control. The intention is to design a composite wing spar for
   a small unmanned aerial vehicle which is able to harvest energy itself
   from ambient vibrations during normal flight along with available
   sunlight. If the wing experiences any strong wind gust, it will sense
   the increased vibration levels and provide vibration control to maintain
   its stability. The proposed multifunctional composite wing spar
   integrates a flexible solar cell array, piezoelectric wafers, a thin
   film battery, and an electronic module into a composite sandwich
   structure. The piezoelectric wafers act as sensors, actuators, and
   harvesters. The basic design factors are discussed for a beam-like
   multifunctional wing spar with energy harvesting, strain sensing, and
   self-controlling functions. The configurations, locations, and operating
   modes of piezoelectric transducers are also discussed for optimal power
   generation. The equivalent electromechanical representations of a
   multifunctional wing spar is derived theoretically and simulated
   numerically. Special attention is given to the self-contained gust
   alleviation with the goal of using available energy harvested from
   ambient vibrations. A reduced energy control law is implemented to
   reduce the actuation energy and the dissipated heat. This law integrates
   saturation control with a positive strain feedback controller and is
   represented by a positive feedback operation amplifier and a voltage
   buffer operation amplifier for each mode. This study builds off of our
   previous research and holds promise for improving unmanned aerial
   vehicle performance in wind gusts. Here, we also include, but not use, a
   flexible solar panel in our modeling.}},

   Two-dimensional mapping of the luminescence spatially and spectrally

   different exciton transitions of the same quantum dot, or (ii) different

   increases linearly with power, and maps of the emission show that the
   positions of each peak are spatially separated, suggesting that the
   peaks are ground-state exciton emission from different dots. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computational investigation of the response of
   steel beam-column assemblies with moment connections under monotonic
   loading conditions simulating a column removal scenario. Two beam-column
   assemblies are analyzed, which incorporate (1) welded unreinforced
   flange bolted web connections, and (2) reduced beam section connections.
   Detailed models of the assemblies are developed, which use highly
   refined solid and shell elements to represent nonlinear material
   behavior and fracture. Reduced models are also developed, which use a
   much smaller number of beam and spring elements and are intended for use
   in future studies to assess the vulnerability of complete structural
   systems to disproportionate collapse. The two modeling approaches are
   described, and computational results are compared with the results of
   the full-scale tests described in the companion paper. Good agreement is
   observed, demonstrating that both the detailed and reduced models are
   capable of capturing the predominant response characteristics and
   failure modes of the assemblies, including the development of tensile
   forces associated with catenary action and the ultimate failure of the
   moment connections under combined bending and axial stresses. DOI:

Journal = {{GAIT \& POSTURE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{61-66}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Thirty-two healthy young adults (15 women) were tested for their ability
   to maintain their comfortable step pattern following an unpredictable
   underfoot perturbation in the presence and absence of a concurrent vocal
   choice reaction time task. Custom instrumented shoes were used to
   randomly deliver an unexpected medial or lateral forefoot perturbation
   that inverted the mid-foot an average of 10 degrees or everted the
   midfoot an average of 9 degrees during one stance phase of a gait trial.
   Medial and lateral perturbations were randomized between left and right
   feet in 12 of 30 gait trials.
   The results of the repeated measures analyses of variance show that,
   compared to the step parameters of unperturbed gait, the administration
   of the unexpected underfoot perturbation did not significantly lead to
   alterations in the step length or width of the first recovery step. In
   addition, the simultaneous administration of a vocal choice reaction
   time task with the underfoot perturbation did not significantly affect
   the kinematics of the first recovery step.
   We conclude that in young healthy adults an unexpected 9-10 degrees
   underfoot perturbation, with or without a vocal reaction time task, will
   not affect their recovery step kinematics when walking at a comfortable
   gait speed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: We previously reported that simvastatin and enamel matrix
   derivative (EMD) have a dentinogenic effect. However, there is little
   information about the combined effects of these 2 agents on
   odontoblastic differentiation. The aim of this study was to investigate
   the effects of combined treatment with simvastatin and EMD on
   odontoblastic differentiation of human dental pulp cells (hDPCs). This
   study further explored the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
   (ERK) as a target and mediator of the differentiation induced by
   simvastatin in hDPCs. Methods: The odontoblastic differentiation was
   analyzed by alkaline phosphatase activity, real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) for odontoblastic/osteoblastic markers (ie, dentin
   sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein 1, and osteonectin), and
   alizarin red S staining. We also explored the role of ERK signaling as a
   mediator of simvastatin by Western blotting and real-time PCR. The
   expression of osteoblast-specific transcription factors was detected by
   reverse-transcription PCR. Results: The alkaline phosphatase activity
   and the expression of odontoblastic markers (ie, dentin
   sialophosphoprotein and dentin matrix protein 1) increased in
   simvastatin/EMD-treated cells. Mineralized nodule formation increased in
   EMD- and simvastatin/EMD-treated cells. Notably, the combined use of
   both simvastatin and EMD resulted in more potent differentiation than
   that observed after a single therapy. Simvastatin activated ERK
   phosphorylation and treatment with ERK inhibitor blocked the messenger
   RNA expression of odontoblastic markers. However, in
   simvastatin/EMD-treated cells, the expression of these genes did not
   decrease significantly. Compared with other groups, the EMD- and
   simvastatin/EMD-treated group showed a greater expression of osterix.
   Conclusions: Simvastatin promotes odontoblastic differentiation of hDPCs
   via the ERK signaling pathway. In addition, simvastatin-induced
   differentiation is facilitated by co-treatment with EMD. Collectively,
   these results suggest a new strategy to induce odontoblastic
   differentiation of hDPCs. (J Endod 2013;39:76-82)}},

Abstract = {{Growing concerns about sustainable development have brought about an
   urgent need to develop global efforts to mitigate environmental impact.
   Although construction projects and their related activities consume much
   energy and generate a significant amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) and
   other diesel emissions, the efforts to mitigate these emissions remain
   at an early stage. To address this issue, this paper explores
   opportunities to consider contractors' green capabilities during the bid
   evaluation phase. Based on reviews of the success story of the A + B
   bidding method, this paper suggests a modified bidding system in which
   contractors bid on the cost (part A) and environmental cost (part C) or
   on the cost (part A), time (part B), and environmental cost (part C) for
   public projects. An application of the proposed bidding methods is
   described using a bid for a highway reconstruction project. This case
   study reveals the potential impact of environmental cost criteria on the
   selection of a winning bid. The result of this case study indicates that
   the proposed bidding methods can offer bidding incentives to create
   sustainability initiatives for public works contractors. DOI:

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries vary in severity and
   damage to the AC and coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments. We hypothesized
   that transclavicular-transcoracoid drilling techniques, which allow for
   arthroscopic passage and fixation of tendon grafts in bone sockets to
   replace the insufficient conoid and trapezoid ligaments, cannot restore
   the footprints of the conoid and trapezoid ligaments without significant
   risk of cortical breach and coracoid fracture.
   Materials and methods: Data from a prospective computed tomography
   shoulder registry were used to create 23 distinct shoulders.
   Three-dimensional models were constructed the shoulders in which virtual
   CC ligament reconstruction tunnels were superimposed using previously
   described anatomic distances and landmarks.
   Results: Transclavicular-transcoracoid techniques resulted in mean
   remaining medial and lateral wall thicknesses before cortical breach of
   7.3 +/- 1.7 and 7.0 +/- 1.6 mm, respectively. The distance from the
   entry point of this tunnel from the anatomic midpoint of the CC
   ligaments was 9.9 +/- 2.2 mm. Attempts to recapitulate the CC ligament
   anatomy by using anatomic distances and landmarks with transcoracoid,
   transclavicular techniques resulted in medial cortical breach of the
   coracoid in 91.3\% of the shoulders.
   Conclusion: Transclavicular-transcoracoid reconstructive techniques
   cannot restore the footprints of the conoid and trapezoid ligaments
   without significant risk of cortical breach and fracture. Attempts to
   correct this nonanatomic configuration by creating a tunnel based on the
   anatomic footprints results in a nearly universal medial cortical breach
   of the coracoid process.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{3145-3153}},
Abstract = {{In this work, the acoustic behavior of a combustion instability in a gas
   turbine model combustor was investigated as fuel properties, air flow
   rates, and burner geometry were varied. The dual-swirl burner, developed
   at DLR Stuttgart by Meier, was operated using syngas (H-2/CO), ethylene,
   propane, and methane. The frequency of the instability was found to vary
   significantly from 250 to 480 Hz. When the plenum volume and the exhaust
   pipe length and diameter were changed, the frequencies followed trends
   similar to a Helmholtz resonator. The variation of fuel type, flame
   speed, and air flow rate greatly altered the instability frequency and
   amplitude. These effects are not predicted by Helmholtz or organ tone
   acoustic theory. Higher frequencies were correlated with larger laminar
   burning velocities and higher air flow rates. The burner is a forced
   resonator, in which the flame oscillations couple with the flowfield to
   create convectively altered Helmholtz resonances. This suggests the need
   for an improved model of a forced Helmholtz resonator that includes
   flame properties. Alkane fuels displayed similar acoustic trends, but
   ethylene varied greatly from methane and propane. Syngas displayed
   different behavior than hydrocarbon fuels, even when the laminar flame
   speeds of the fuels were matched between ethylene and a syngas mixture.
   Flame characteristics such as anchoring, liftoff height, and shape
   appear to play a major role in the determination of instability strength
   and presence. With increasing hydrogen-content in the syngas-mixture,
   the flame transitions from a lifted to a fully anchored flame, resulting
   in a drastic decrease in the acoustic amplitude associated with
   non-resonating flames. Rayleigh indices show that flat flames create
   strong regions of thermoacoustic coupling compared to axially extended
   V-shape flames. It is concluded that, in the current burner
   configuration, integrated-acoustics occur that involve a combination of
   Helmholtz and convectivemechanisms. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{This overview presents examples of applications of high frame rate
   imaging diagnostics in fundamental and applied combustion research.
   Progress in the performance of high frame rate digital cameras and high
   repetition rate lasers enabled the development of a range of new imaging
   diagnostics for measurements of velocities, concentrations and
   temperatures. Camera frame rates and storage capacities are now adequate
   to resolve and follow time scales spanning six orders of magnitude while
   camera chip size limitations restrict the spatial dynamic range to about
   three orders of magnitude. High-speed imaging studies of mixing
   processes, flame stabilization, ignition and extinction and the coupling
   of acoustic and chemical processes in turbulent flames and internal
   combustion engines have produced a wealth of new understanding,
   contributing also to the development of predictive models. Future
   progress in designing and operating cleaner and more efficient
   combustion device hinges on our ability to push operating conditions to
   leaner mixtures and often to higher pressures. There, small variations
   in boundary conditions, e. g. flow patterns or the formation of a fuel
   spray, might lead to combustion failures that can range from acoustic
   noise in a jet flame, a misfire in an automobile engine, to
   lean-blow-out of an aircraft gas turbine engine; from nuisance to
   catastrophe. High-speed imaging in turbulent flames and internal
   combustion engines allowed capturing and identifying detrimental
   conditions that might be rare in occurrence and defining in leading to
   failure. The examples presented in this review illustrate the status of
   diagnostic capabilities, show sample results, and examine some future
   directions. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{High-speed laser induced fluorescence (LIF) thermometry is combined with
   particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure the temporal evolution of
   the spatial unburned gas temperature distribution in a motored
   spark-ignition (SI) optical engine. Single-line excitation of toluene
   and subsequent two-color emission detection is employed for LIF
   thermometry. Precision uncertainty is assessed pixel-wise and found to
   be +/- 5 K at 295 K and +/- 29 K at 550 K, but decreases by 34\% (i.e.,
   +/- 19 K at 550 K) when spatially averaging the LIF signal over a 10 x
   10 pixel(2) region. The polytropic temperature relation is used to
   correlate LIF ratio with temperature to calibrate the in-cylinder gas
   temperature measurements. Instantaneous temperature images and
   temperature PDFs show homogeneous temperature distribution during
   compression, while significant temperature inhomogeneities from
   entrained colder gases are captured during early expansion.
   Simultaneously acquired PIV and LIF images illustrate the evolution of
   the cold gas distribution during expansion. The images presented reveal
   the capability of high-speed toluene-LIF thermometry combined with PIV
   in an engine to capture the 2D temperature distribution and track
   structures of colder temperatures. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{This work describes the successful coupling of partial nitrification
   (nitritation) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation in a membrane-aerated
   biofilm reactor (MABR) with continuous aeration. Controlling the
   relative surface loadings of oxygen versus ammonium prevented complete
   nitrite oxidation and allowed anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria
   (AnaerAOB) to develop and be retained for > 250 days. Daily autotrophic
   nitrogen removal of 1.7 g N/m(2) (75\% of influent N load) was achieved
   at an oxygen/nitrogen surface loading ratio of 2.2, with up to 85\% of
   the influent N proceeding through AnaerAOB. During early nitritation,
   nitrogen oxide (NO(g), NO2(g), and N2O(g)) emissions comprised up to
   10\% of the removed influent nitrogen, but emissions disappeared after
   proliferation of AnaerAOB. Microbial communities were radially
   stratified, with aerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB) colonizing
   nearest to and AnaerAOB furthest from the membrane. Despite the presence
   of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, this work demonstrated that these
   autotrophic processes can be successfully coupled in an MABR with
   continuous aeration, achieving the benefits of competitive specific N
   removal rates and the elimination of gaseous nitrogen oxide emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Gene transfer of key regulators of osteogenesis for mesenchymal stem
   cells represents a promising strategy to regenerate bone. It has been
   reported that LMP3, a transcription variant of LIM domain mineralization
   protein (LMP) lacking LIM domains, can induce osteogenesis in vitro and
   in vivo. As little is known about the effects of LMP3 gene therapy on
   periodontal ligament (PDL) cell osteogenic differentiation, this study
   sought to explore whether gene delivery of LMP3 can promote PDL cell
   mineralization and bone formation. Our results showed that adenoviral
   mediated gene transfer of LMP3 (AdLMP3) significantly upregulated ALP
   (Alkaline Phosphatase), BSP (Bone Sialoprotein) and BMP2 gene expression
   and increased in vitro matrix mineralization in human PDL. Although
   AdLMP3 gene delivery to PDL cells did not induce ectopic bone formation
   in vivo, we found that AdLMP3 augments new bone formation, which
   co-delivered with AdBMP7 gene transfer. Our study provides the evidence
   that there is a synergistic effect between LMP3 and BMP-7 in vivo,
   suggesting that LMP3 delivery may be used to augment BMP-mediated
   osteogenesis. LMP3 and BMP-7 combinatory gene therapy may also have
   specific applications for oral and periodontal regenerative medicine.

Abstract = {{Analysis of a printed-circuit tensor impedance surface (PCTIS) is
   presented. The surface consists of a periodic, subwavelength-patterned
   metallic cladding printed over a grounded dielectric substrate. First,
   the dispersion equation for an idealized tensor impedance boundary
   condition is derived by expressing the field in terms of TE and TM
   waves. A similar method is then used to find the dispersion equation of
   the PCTIS consisting of a tensor sheet impedance, which models the
   metallic cladding, over a grounded dielectric substrate. In addition, a
   method for extracting the tensor sheet impedance of a periodic, metallic
   cladding printed over a grounded dielectric substrate, is reported. It
   involves performing two normal-incidence scattering simulations using a
   full-wave electromagnetic solver. The method is strictly valid when the
   ground plane is sufficiently far from the metallic cladding to avoid
   evanescent-wave interactions. By combining the tensor sheet extraction
   method with the dispersion equation, the full dispersion characteristics
   of the PCTIS are analytically predicted in the homogenous limit. The
   results are verified through full-wave eigenmode simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies optimal policy for modular product reassembly within
   a remanufacturing setting where a firm receives product returns with
   variable quality and reassembles products of multiple classes to
   customer orders. High-quality modules are allowed to substitute for
   low-quality modules during reassembly to provide the remanufacturing
   system with flexibility such that shortage in lower quality modules can
   be smoothed out by higher quality module inventories. We formulate the
   problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of
   the optimal control policy. In particular, we show that the optimal
   reassembly and substitution follow a state-dependent threshold-based
   control policy. We also establish the structural properties of the
   thresholds. Using numerical experimentation, we study how system
   performance is influenced by key cost parameters including unit holding
   cost, unit assembly cost and shortage penalty cost. Finally, we compare
   the optimal policy with an exhaustive reassembly policy and show that
   there is great benefit in module substitution and threshold-based
   assembly control.}},

Abstract = {{Using relatively simple and widely used models, we illustrate how carbon
   emission concerns could be integrated into operational decision-making
   with regard to procurement, production, and inventory management. We
   show how, by associating carbon emission parameters with various
   decision variables, traditional models can be modified to support
   decision-making that accounts for both cost and carbon footprint. We
   examine how the values of these parameters as well as the parameters of
   regulatory emission control policies affect cost and emissions. We use
   the models to study the extent to which carbon reduction requirements
   can be addressed by operational adjustments, as an alternative (or a
   supplement) to costly investments in carbon-reducing technologies. We
   also use the models to investigate the impact of collaboration among
   firms within the same supply chain on their costs and carbon emissions
   and study the incentives firms might have in seeking such cooperation.
   We provide a series of insights that highlight the impact of operational
   decisions on carbon emissions and the importance of operational models
   in evaluating the impact of different regulatory policies and in
   assessing the benefits of investments in more carbon efficient

Abstract = {{Multiframe super-resolution is the problem of reconstructing a single
   high-resolution (HR) image from several low-resolution (LR) versions of
   it. We assume that the original HR image undergoes different linear
   transforms, where each transform can be approximated as a set of linear
   shift-invariant transforms over different subregions of the HR image.
   The linearly transformed versions of the HR image are then downsampled,
   resulting in different LR images. Under the assumption of linearity,
   these LR images can form a basis that spans the set of the polyphase
   components (PPCs) of the HR image. We propose sampling rate diversity,
   where a secondary LR image, acquired by a secondary sensor of different
   (lower) sampling rate, is used as a reference to make known portions
   (subpolyphase components) of the PPCs of the reconstructed HR image.
   This setup allows for non-parametric reconstruction of the PPCs, where
   no knowledge of the underlying transforms is required, by solving for
   the expansion coefficients of the PPCs, in terms of the LR basis.}},

   The angles between ligaments, the ligaments length and curvature were
   assessed on 3D models constructed from twenty MRIs of volunteers with
   normal support. How angle variation theoretically affects ligament
   tension was investigated using a simplified biomechanical model.
   The CLs are 18.1 A degrees A +/- 6.8 A degrees(SD) from the
   cephalic-caudal body axis , and the USs are dorsally directed and 92.5 A
   degrees A +/- 13.5 from the body axis. The CLs are longer and more
   curved than US. The theoretical calculated tension on CL is 52 \% larger
   than that on US.
   The CL is relatively parallel to the body axis while the US is dorsally
   directed. The tensions on these ligaments are affected by their

   an axially impacted, slender, geometrically imperfect, column is studied

   axial stress wave propagation is employed to study the physics of the
   buckling response with the nonuniform axial strain distribution varying

Title = {{Breast density measurements with ultrasound tomography: A comparison
   with film and digital mammography}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the use of the whole-breast sound speed
   measurement as a marker of breast density (BD), a known risk factor for
   breast cancer.
   Methods: As part of an ongoing study of breast cancer detection, 249
   patients were scanned with a clinical prototype that operates on the
   principles of ultrasound tomography. Typically, 40-100 sound speed
   tomograms were reconstructed from the scan data, corresponding to the
   entire volume of the breast of each patient. The data were used to
   estimate the volume averaged sound speed (VASS) of the breast for each
   patient. The corresponding mammograms were used to calculate
   mammographic percent density (MPD) using CUMULUS software. Film
   mammograms were available for 164 patients while 85 digital mammograms
   were available for the remaining patients. Standard statistical
   techniques were used to determine associations of breast sound speed
   with a variety of mammographic measures such as percent density, area of
   dense tissue, and area of nondense tissue. Furthermore, associations of
   breast sound speed with continuous variables such as age and weight and
   dichotomous variables such as parity and menopausal status were also
   assessed.
   Results: VASS was found to be significantly associated with MPD. The
   Spearman correlation coefficient (r(s)) between VASS and MPD was found
   to be 0.77 and 0.71 for film and digital mammography, respectively. VASS
   was positively correlated with dense areas by mammography, both digital
   (r(s) = 0.46) and film (r(s) = 0.56). VASS was negatively associated
   with nondense area by mammography, both digital (r(s) = -0.58) and film
   (r(s) = -0.63). BD by all methods was less in postmenopausal than in
   premenopausal women. The MPD was lower in the postmenopausal group (by
   6.6\%, p < 0.08, for the digital group and 7.73\%, p < 0.007, for the
   film group). The VASS was also lower in the postmenopausal group (by 15
   m/s, p < 0.001 for the digital group and 8 m/s, p < 0.08, for the film
   group). The association of MPD with age was characterized with r(s) =
   -0.06 (p < 0.6) for digital mammography and r(s) = -0.53 (p < 0.002) for
   film mammography. For weight, the MPD associations were characterized by
   r(s) = -0.53 (p < 0.0001) for digital mammography and -0.38 (p < 0.0001)
   for film mammography. The association of VASS with age was r(s) = -0.33
   (p < 0.002) for the digital group and -0.17 (p < 0.03) for the film
   group. For weight, the relationship was characterized with r(s) = -0.45
   (p < 0.001) for the digital group and -0.37 (p < 0.0001) for the film
   group.
   Conclusions: The association between VASS and MPD is strong for both
   film and digital mammography, suggesting that VASS is a viable measure
   of breast density. This result sets the stage for future work that will
   focus on directly testing the association of VASS with breast cancer
   risk. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract = {{Distraction-induced enterogenesis, whereby the intestine lengthens with
   application of linear forces, is an emerging area which may provide a
   unique treatment for short bowel syndrome. With an increase in overall
   tissue mass, there is an increase in oxygen and nutrient demand. We
   hypothesized that a neovascularization within the mesentery is necessary
   to support the growing small bowel.
   A curvilinear hydraulic device was used to induce growth within the
   small bowel of Yorkshire pigs, and the intestine was harvested after 14
   days. High-resolution gross pictures were recorded of the mesentery at
   implantation and at harvest, and CT imaging of the bowel and mesentery
   was performed at harvest after dye injection.
   After 2 weeks of distraction, an average of 72.5 \% (8.7 cm) bowel
   lengthening was achieved. Gross images of the mesentery between major
   vessels showed a blossoming of the microvasculature and this was
   confirmed by CT imaging with 3D reconstruction. Mesenteric sample taken
   from the distracted segment had a fourfold increase in the volume of
   microvasculature versus controls.
   Enterogenesis results not only in increased bowel length, but also
   significant increase in the mesenteric microvascularity. Presumably,
   this sustains the lengthened segment after application of longitudinal
   forces.}},

Abstract = {{We have designed an opposed-flow flame system to investigate the

   molecular-beam mass spectrometry with synchrotron-generated tunable

   details of the experimental apparatus, sampling method, and
   data-reduction procedures. To test the system, we have investigated the
   chemical composition of three low-pressure (30-50 Torr), non-premixed,
   opposed-flow acetylene(Ar)/O-2(Ar) flames. We measured quantitative
   mole-fraction profiles as a function of the distance from the fuel
   outlet for the major species and several intermediates, including the
   methyl and propargyl radicals. We determined the temperature profiles of
   these flames by normalizing a sampling-instrument function to
   thermocouple measurements near the fuel outlet. A comparison of the
   experimental temperature and major species profiles with modeling
   results indicates that flame perturbations caused by the sampling probe
   are minimal. The observed agreement between experimental and modeled
   results, apparent for most combustion species, is similar to
   corresponding studies of premixed flames. (C) 2012 The Combustion

Title = {{Analysis of n-heptane auto-ignition characteristics using computational
   singular perturbation}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1125-1133}},
Abstract = {{To provide insights into auto-ignition characteristics in low
   temperature combustion (LTC) engine conditions, computational singular
   perturbation (CSP) analysis is used to gain fundamental understanding
   into classification of ignition regimes in n-heptane air mixtures in the
   presence of temperature and composition inhomogeneities. Parametric
   studies are conducted using high-fidelity simulations with detailed
   chemistry and transport. In particular, a key interest is to understand
   different ignition behavior of the n-heptane mixture at the
   negative-temperature coefficient (NTC) versus the non-NTC conditions.
   The CSP analysis for the reference homogeneous system yields the number
   of exhausted modes (M) at various stages during the ignition event. In
   addition, the merging of two explosive modes is observed at the onset of
   auto-ignition. For the one-dimensional system, the M profiles along with
   the importance index (I T) measured in the upstream of the ignition
   front are used to determine whether the front propagation is the
   spontaneous (I T ! 0) or deflagrative (I T ! 1) regime. At the
   relatively large temperature fluctuation considered herein, the mixture
   at non-NTC conditions shows initially a deflagration front which is
   subsequently transitioned into a spontaneous ignition front. For the
   mixtures at the NTC conditions which exhibit two-stage ignition
   behavior, the 1st stage ignition front is found to be more likely in the
   deflagration regime. On the other hand, the 2nd stage ignition front
   occurs almost always in the spontaneous regime because the upstream
   mixture contains active radical species produced by the preceding 1st
   stage ignition front. The effects of differently correlated equivalence
   ratio stratification are also considered and the results are shown to be
   consistent with previous findings. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, the understanding of the processes related to
   the formation of soot has progressed considerably. However, the
   mechanisms that are responsible for the nucleation of soot are still
   unclear. While there is consensus that the formation of soot nuclei can
   be related to two classes of mechanisms (physical and chemical growth),
   their relative importance is still under debate. In particular, the
   aggregation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially
   pyrene, has been proposed as key step for soot formation but strong
   experimental or computational proofs are still missing. To shed light on
   this issue, we conducted a thermodynamic analysis of the physical growth
   of poly-aromatic hydrocarbons using atomistic models. Free energy
   profiles of dimerization and trimerization processes of several PAHs are
   computed using molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with
   advanced sampling techniques. Our study focuses not only on the
   potential energy of the clustering processes, but it also addresses the
   entropic contributions that affect the dimerization and trimerization of
   PAHs. The results of these simulations show that even at 1000 K, only
   the formation of dimers of relative big species, such as ovalene or
   bigger, are favored over their corresponding free monomers, ruling out
   the simple stacking of pyrene as the main step for soot formation. The
   shapes of the free energy profiles also illustrate that there are no
   barriers in the exploration of the phase space and therefore, that the
   dimerization process itself is not kinetically controlled. Geometrical
   factors, such as the symmetry of the monomers, as well as the presence
   of substituted aliphatic chains play an important role in the physical
   agglomeration of PAH that can eventually lead to soot nuclei. (C) 2012

Journal = {{ROBOTICA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-53}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Hazardous terrains pose a crucial challenge to mobile robots. To operate
   safely and efficiently, it is necessary to detect the terrain type and
   modify operation strategies in real-time. Fast analytical models of
   wheeled locomotion on deformable terrains are thus important. Based on
   classic terramechanics, a closed-form wheel soil interaction model was
   derived by quadratic approximation of stresses along the wheel-soil
   interface. The bulldozing resistance and the effects of grousers were
   also added for more accurate prediction of wheel contact forces. A
   non-iterative method was proposed to estimate the entry angle, by using
   approximated vertical pressure acting on the wheels. The computational
   efficiency was improved by avoiding traditional recursive search.
   Real-time computation of the wheel contact forces is achieved by the
   terramechanics-based formula (TBF), which was developed by integrating
   the wheel soil interaction model and the entry angle estimator. In
   addition, an automotive-inspired approach was used to integrate the TBF
   and the simplified vehicle dynamics model for fast simulation of mobile
   robots. Stability problems in numerical simulation could be avoided by
   this method. The above models were verified by comparing simulation
   results and experiment data, including single-wheel experiments and
   full-vehicle experiments.}},

Title = {{On the synthesis of a bio-inspired dual-cellular fluidic flexible matrix
   composite adaptive structure based on a non-dimensional dynamics model}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A recent study investigated the dynamic characteristics of an adaptive
   structure concept featuring dual fluidic flexible matrix composite
   ((FMC)-M-2) cells inspired by the configuration of plant cells and cell
   walls. This novel bio-inspired system consists of two (FMC)-M-2 cells
   with different fiber angles connected through internal fluid circuits.
   It was discovered that the dual (FMC)-M-2 cellular structure can be
   characterized as a two degree of freedom damped mass-spring oscillator,
   and can be utilized as a vibration absorber or an enhanced actuator
   under different operation conditions. These results demonstrated that
   the concept is promising and further investigations are needed to
   develop methodologies for synthesizing future multi-cellular (FMC)-M-2
   structural systems.
   While interesting, the previous study focused on specific case studies
   and analysis. That is, the outcome did not provide insight that could be
   generalized, or tools for synthesizing a multiple (FMC)-M-2 cellular
   structure. This paper attempts to address this important issue by
   developing a non-dimensional dynamic model, which reveals good physical
   insights as well as identifying crucial constitutive parameters for
   (FMC)-M-2 cellular design. Working with these parameters, rather than
   physical variables, can greatly simplify the mathematics involved in the
   study. A synthesis tool is then developed for the dual-cellular
   structure, and it is found that for each set of achievable target poles
   and zero, there exist multiple (FMC)-M-2 cellular designs, forming a
   design space. The presented physical insights and synthesis tool for the
   dual-cellular structure will be the building blocks for future
   investigation on cellular structures with a larger number of cells.}},

Title = {{Collaborative visualization of engineering processes using tabletop
   augmented reality}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{45-55}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{3D computer visualization has emerged as an advanced problem-solving
   tool for engineering education and practice. For example in civil
   engineering, the integration of 3D/4D CAD models in the construction
   process helps to minimize the misinterpretation of the spatial,
   temporal, and logical aspects of construction planning information. Yet
   despite the advances made in visualization, the lack of collaborative
   problem-solving abilities leaves outstanding challenges that need to be
   addressed before 3D visualization can become widely accepted in the
   classroom and in professional practice. The ability to smoothly and
   naturally interact in a shared workspace characterizes a collaborative
   learning process. This paper introduces tabletop Augmented Reality to
   accommodate the need to collaboratively visualize computer-generated
   models. A new software program named ARVita is developed to validate
   this idea, where multiple users wearing Head-Mounted Displays and
   sitting around a table can all observe and interact with dynamic visual
   simulations of engineering processes. The applications of collaborative
   visualization using Augmented Reality are reviewed, the technical
   implementation is covered, and the program's underlying tracking
   libraries are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   low temperature solid oxide fuel cells}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1296-1301}},
Abstract = {{Strain confinement in heterostructured films significantly affects ionic
   conductivity of the electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells based on a
   multi-layered design strategy. Nearly ideal tensile strain can be
   achieved by a dedicated manipulation of the lattice mismatch between
   adjacent layers and fine control of the layer thicknesses to minimize
   the formation of dislocations and thus to achieve optimized ionic
   conduction. This strategy was demonstrated by a model system of
   multilayered 8 mol\%Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) with Gd2Zr2O7 (GZO)
   films, which were epitaxially grown on Al2O3 (0001) substrates by pulsed
   laser deposition (PLD) with the \{111\} planes of YSZ/GZO along the
   Al2O3 {[}0 1 -1 0] direction. The tensile strain (3\%) resulting from
   the lattice mismatch can be confined in individual YSZ layers with the
   formation of a coherent, dislocation-free interface upon the
   manipulation of the layer thickness below a critical value, e. g., down
   to 5 nm. The strained heterostructure displays a two order-of-magnitude
   increase in oxide-ion conductivity as compared with bulk YSZ, and a high
   ionic conductivity of 0.01 S cm(-1) at 475 degrees C can be achieved,
   five times greater than that of Gd-doped ceria/zirconia. The approach of
   strain confinement by fine control of lattice mismatch and layer
   thickness represents a promising strategy in developing advanced
   electrolytes enabling the miniaturization of solid-state ionic devices
   that can be operated at low temperatures below 500 degrees C.}},

Journal = {{STEM CELLS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Current practices to maintain human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs),
   which include induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells,
   in an undifferentiated state typically depend on the support of feeder
   cells such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or an extracellular
   matrix such as Matrigel. Culture conditions that depend on these
   undefined support systems limit our ability to interpret mechanistic
   studies aimed at resolving how hPSCs interact with their extracellular
   environment to remain in a unique undifferentiated state and to make
   fate-changing lineage decisions. Likewise, the xenogeneic components of
   MEFs and Matrigel ultimately hinder our ability to use pluripotent stem
   cells to treat debilitating human diseases. Many of these obstacles have
   been overcome by the development of synthetic coatings and bioreactors
   that support hPSC expansion and self-renewal within defined culture
   conditions that are free from xenogeneic contamination. The
   establishment of defined culture conditions and synthetic matrices will
   facilitate studies to more precisely probe the molecular basis of
   pluripotent stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. When combined
   with three-dimensional cultures in bioreactors, these systems will also
   enable large-scale expansion for future clinical applications. STEM

Journal = {{DENTAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{97-102}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. The clinical translation of stem cell-based Regenerative
   Endodontics demands further development of suitable injectable
   scaffolds. Puramatrix (TM) is a defined, self-assembling peptide
   hydrogel which instantaneously polymerizes under normal physiological
   conditions. Here, we assessed the compatibility of Puramatrix (TM) with
   dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) growth and differentiation.
   Methods. DPSC cells were grown in 0.05-0.25\% Puramatrix (TM). Cell
   viability was measured colorimetrically using the WST-1 assay. Cell
   morphology was observed in 3D modeling using confocal microscopy. In
   addition, we used the human tooth slice model with Puramatrix (TM) to
   verify DPSC differentiation into odontoblast-like cells, as measured by
   expression of DSPP and DMP-1.
   Results. DPSC survived and proliferated in Puramatrix (TM) for at least
   three weeks in culture. Confocal microscopy revealed that cells seeded
   in Puramatrix (TM) presented morphological features of healthy cells,
   and some cells exhibited cytoplasmic elongations. Notably, after 21 days
   in tooth slices containing Puramatrix (TM), DPSC cells expressed DMP-1
   and DSPP, putative markers of odontoblastic differentiation.
   Significance. Collectively, these data suggest that self-assembling
   peptide hydrogels might be useful injectable scaffolds for stem
   cell-based Regenerative Endodontics. (c) 2012 Academy of Dental

Abstract = {{This study analysed the nitrifier community in the biofilter of a zero
   discharge, recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) for the production of
   marine shrimp in a low density (low ammonium production) system. The
   ammonia-oxidizing populations were examined by targeting 16S rRNA and
   amoA genes of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). The
   nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were investigated by targeting the 16S
   rRNA gene. Archaeal amoA genes were more abundant in all compartments of
   the RAS than bacterial amoA genes. Analysis of bacterial and archaeal
   amoA gene sequences revealed that most ammonia oxidizers were related to
   Nitrosomonas marina and Nitrosopumilus maritimus. The NOB detected were
   related to Nitrospira marina and Nitrospira moscoviensis, and Nitrospira
   marina-type NOB were more abundant than N. moscoviensis-type NOB. Water
   quality and biofilm attachment media played a role in the
   competitiveness of AOA over AOB and Nitrospira marina-over N.
   moscoviensis-type NOB.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery that dental pulp stem cells are capable of differentiating
   into endothelial cells raises the exciting possibility that these cells
   can be a single source of odontoblasts and vascular networks in dental
   tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to begin to define
   signaling pathways that regulate endothelial differentiation of SHED.
   Stem cells from exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) exposed to endothelial
   growth medium (EGM-2MV) supplemented with vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) differentiated into VEGFR2-positive and CD31-positive
   endothelial cells in vitro. In vivo, VEGFR1-silenced SHED seeded in
   tooth slice/scaffolds and transplanted into immunodeficient mice showed
   a reduction in human CD31-positive blood vessels as compared with
   controls (p = 0.02). Exposure of SHED to EGM2-MV supplemented with VEGF
   induced potent activation of ERK and Akt signaling, while it inhibited
   phosphorylation of STAT3. Notably, genetic (MEK1 silencing) or chemical
   (U0126) inhibition of ERK signaling restored constitutive STAT3
   phosphorylation and inhibited the differentiation of SHED into
   endothelial cells. Collectively, analysis of these data unveiled the
   VEGF/MEK1/ERK signaling pathway as a key regulator of the endothelial
   differentiation of dental pulp stem cells.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{297-301}},
Abstract = {{Measurement of a solution's viscosity is an important analytic technique
   for a variety of applications including medical diagnosis,
   pharmaceutical development, and industrial processing. The use of
   droplet-based (e. g., water-in-oil) microfluidics for viscosity
   measurements allows nanoliter-scale sample volumes to be used, much
   smaller than those either in standard macro-scale rheometers or in
   single-phase microfluidic viscometers. By observing the flow rate of a
   sample plug driven by a controlled pressure through an abrupt
   constriction, we achieve accurate and precise measurement of the plug
   viscosity without addition of labels or tracer particles. Sample plugs
   in our device geometry had a volume of similar to 30 nL, and
   measurements had an average error of 6.6\% with an average relative
   standard deviation of 2.8\%. We tested glycerol-based samples with
   viscosities as high as 101 mPa s, with the only limitation on samples
   being that their viscosity should be higher than that of the continuous
   oil phase.}},

Title = {{Free vibration of cantilevered composite plates in air and in water}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{254-263}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Composite materials are being used more frequently for marine
   applications due to the advantages of a higher stiffness- and
   strength-to-weight ratio, and better corrosion resistance compared to
   metallic alloys. Many examples consist of cantilevered structures, such
   as hydrofoils, propeller and turbine blades, keels, and rudders. A wide
   range of analytical and numerical tools exist for the free vibration
   analysis of composite structures in air due to their applicability to
   design problems in the aerospace industry, such as airplane wings,
   turbofan and propeller blades, and flight control surfaces. For these
   aerospace structures the inertial effects of the fluid are typically
   neglected due to the low relative density of air compared to the
   structure. Contrarily, for marine structures, fluid inertial (added
   mass) effects cannot be neglected, especially for composites with much
   higher fluid-to-solid density ratios. The objective of this work is to
   investigate the effects of material anisotropy and added mass on the
   free vibration response of rectangular, cantilevered composite
   plates/beams via combined analytical and numerical modeling. The results
   show that the natural frequencies of the composite plate are 50-70\%
   lower in water than in air due to large added mass effects. The added
   mass is found to vary considerably with material orientation due to the
   bend-twist coupling of anisotropic composites, which affects the mode
   shapes and, consequently, the fluid inertial loads. The analytical
   method is found to yield accurate results for beam geometries and offers
   significant savings in computational cost compared to the finite element
   method. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VEHICLE DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{27-46}},
Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is on establishing a robust signal processing
   approach for damaged vehicles (i.e., cracked structures) with structural
   variability such as thicknesses of various components and Young's
   modulus variations. The approach assumes that vibration-type data is
   collected during the operation of a vehicle. Next, the collected data is
   used in a novel combined sensor selection and signal processing
   methodology. The new methodology resolves two key issues for complex
   structures with variability: (i) decides which field data channels are
   statistically optimal to be used, and (ii) establishes which data
   channels should correlate and how. The overall algorithm is based on a
   generalised version of the effective independence distribution vector.
   Also, the correlations among channels are used for noise rejection.
   Furthermore, the dynamics of the vehicle (i. e., a complex structure
   with variabilities) is modelled using Parametric Reduced Order Models
   (PROMs) and the concept of bilinear mode shapes introduced recently by
   the authors for cracked structures. PROMs are used to address the
   presence of variability and account for their effects on the data
   collected from various channels. The bilinear modes are used to capture
   the effects of the crack. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for a
   complex/realistic model of a HMMWV frame with parameter variability and
   a crack.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a surrogate electrochemical lithium-ion battery model,
   presented and discussed in Di Domenico et al. (2008a) and Di Domenico et
   al. (2008b), is parametrised and validated through experimental data by
   a 10 cell 37 V 6.8 Ah Li-ion battery pack. Following past results (Zhang
   et al., 2000; Smith, 2010), the model is based on an approximate
   relationship between the electrode-averaged Butler-Volmer current and
   the solid-electrolyte interface concentration of a surrogate single
   particle for each cell electrode. Equally-spaced radially-discretised
   diffusion dynamics of the surrogate single particle for the positive
   electrode are then used to emulate the lithium concentration evolution
   in the cell. The surface concentration of the surrogate single particle,
   defined as surrogate Critical Surface Concentration (sCSC) is then used
   to predict the cell terminal voltage. The resulting model is as compact
   as an equivalent-circuit model but its underpinnings are lumped
   lithium-ion diffusion dynamics. A few parameters of the lumped lithium
   concentration dynamics are tuned using an iterative optimisation
   procedure with continuous and pulsed current profiles. The single
   particle lithium concentration profile and the surface concentration are
   then estimated using a 4th order Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the
   voltage predictions are compared with data.}},
