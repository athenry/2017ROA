Abstract = {{In this paper, a new topology of a nonisolated boost converter with
   zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) capabilities is proposed. In order to
   realize ZVS conditions, the auxiliary circuit only consists of a coupled
   inductor and a diode, which operates with a zero-current-switching (ZCS)
   condition. Due to ZVS, the reverse recovery problem of MOSFET
   antiparallel body diodes can be resolved, and the voltage and current
   stresses on the switch components are also reduced. The detailed
   operating analysis of the proposed converter and the design method of
   the main circuit are presented. With the aim to verify the effectiveness
   and feasibility of the proposed boost converter, a 500 W experimental
   prototype is built up, and the related experimental waveforms and the
   efficiency curve are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Radar backscattering coefficients for heterogeneous pixels are
   traditionally assumed to be the average of the coefficients for the
   constitutive homogeneous pixels. We investigate the validity of this
   assumption for bare rough surfaces by using the 2-D finite-element
   method to compute the ensemble averaged ``true{''} coefficients for
   heterogeneous pixels and compare these values with the computed averages
   for a variety of surfaces. We quantify the impact of heterogeneity in
   both soil moisture and surface roughness on the averaging assumption. We
   find that the validity of the assumption rests crucially on the surface
   correlation type (exponential or Gaussian) and length. In particular,
   when considering pixels with either heterogeneous soil moisture or
   roughness, we find that for high-contrast pixels, the backscatter
   averaging assumption breaks down by as much as 11 dB for Gaussian
   correlated surfaces for the longest correlation lengths considered
   (regardless of the source of heterogeneity), whereas for exponentially
   correlated surfaces, it breaks down by 6 dB for pixels with
   heterogeneous roughness and 2 dB for pixels with heterogeneous moisture.
   We attribute this behavior to Gaussian correlated surfaces possessing
   higher cross-pixel coherent interactions. Furthermore, conditions of
   validity for the backscatter averaging assumption are identified.}},

Abstract = {{We carried out catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction of Nannochloropsis
   sp. at 350 degrees C in a two-chamber batch reactor that physically
   separated the 5\% Pt/C catalyst from the algae and any solid material by
   a porous metal frit. This two-chamber arrangement provided a higher
   biocrude yield, a gaseous product richer in hydrocarbons, a biocrude
   with a larger ``light{''} (hexane-soluble) portion, and a larger portion
   of biocrude consisting of small molecules than did an equivalent system
   where algae and catalyst were in physical contact. At the temperature
   investigated, a longer reaction time reduced the nitrogen and oxygen
   content in the biocrude, as has been observed in previous studies. Taken
   collectively, these results demonstrate that physically separating the
   heterogeneous catalyst and the biomass improves the catalytic
   hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae, likely by more effectively
   doing the separate tasks of biomass liquefaction and biocrude upgrading
   in a single vessel.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 29}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that the mechanical environment influences cell
   functions in health and disease. Here, we address how the mechanical
   environment influences tumor growth, in particular, the shape of solid
   tumors. In an in vitro tumor model, which isolates mechanical
   interactions between cancer tumor cells and a hydrogel, we find that
   tumors grow as ellipsoids, resembling the same, oft-reported observation
   of in vivo tumors. Specifically, an oblate ellipsoidal tumor shape
   robustly occurs when the tumors grow in hydrogels that are stiffer than
   the tumors, but when they grow in more compliant hydrogels they remain
   closer to spherical in shape. Using large scale, nonlinear elasticity
   computations we show that the oblate ellipsoidal shape minimizes the
   elastic free energy of the tumor-hydrogel system. Having eliminated a
   number of other candidate explanations, we hypothesize that minimization
   of the elastic free energy is the reason for predominance of the
   experimentally observed ellipsoidal shape. This result may hold
   significance for explaining the shape progression of early solid tumors
   in vivo and is an important step in understanding the processes
   underlying solid tumor growth.}},

Abstract = {{The weakness of electron-electron correlations in the itinerant
   antiferromagnet Cr doped with V has long been considered the reason that
   neither new collective electronic states nor even non-Fermi-liquid
   behavior are observed when antiferromagnetism in Cr1-xVx is suppressed
   to zero temperature. We present the results of neutron and electron
   diffraction measurements of several lightly doped single crystals of
   Cr1-xVx in which the archetypal spin density wave instability is
   progressively suppressed as the V content increases, freeing the
   nesting-prone Fermi surface for a new striped charge instability that
   occurs at x(c) = 0.037. This novel nesting driven instability relieves
   the entropy accumulation associated with the suppression of the spin
   density wave and avoids the formation of a quantum critical point by
   stabilizing a new type of charge order at temperatures in excess of 400
   K. Restructuring of the Fermi surface near quantum critical points is a
   feature found in materials as diverse as heavy fermions,
   high-temperature copper oxide superconductors and now even elemental
   metals such as Cr.}},

Abstract = {{Structural and electronic properties of Zn-doped cubic boron nitride

   Zn-N can only be prepared under B-rich conditions. Zn-B induced a
   shallow acceptor level; however, the large difference in
   electronegativity between Zn and N makes the acceptor level strongly
   localized, which reduces effective carrier density. In the case of Zn-N,
   both deep acceptor levels within band gap and shallow acceptor levels at
   the top of valence band were induced, which produced more free carriers
   than Zn-B. The calculated results account for experimental results of
   enhanced electric conductivity of Zn-doped cBN films prepared under

Title = {{Charging of moving surfaces by corona discharges sustained in air}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Atmospheric pressure corona discharges are used in electrophotographic
   (EP) printing technologies for charging imaging surfaces such as
   photoconductors. A typical corona discharge consists of a wire (or wire
   array) biased with a few hundred volts of dc plus a few kV of ac
   voltage. An electric discharge is produced around the corona wire from
   which electrons drift towards and charge the underlying dielectric
   surface. The surface charging reduces the voltage drop across the gap
   between the corona wire and the dielectric surface, which then
   terminates the discharge, as in a dielectric barrier discharge. In
   printing applications, this underlying surface is continuously moving
   throughout the charging process. For example, previously charged
   surfaces, which had reduced the local electric field and terminated the
   local discharge, are translated out of the field of view and are
   replaced with uncharged surface. The uncharged surface produces a
   rebound in the electric field in the vicinity of the corona wire which
   in turn results in re-ignition of the discharge. The discharge, so
   reignited, is then asymmetric. We found that in the idealized corona
   charging system we investigated, a negatively dc biased corona blade
   with a dielectric covered ground electrode, the discharge is initially
   sustained by electron impact ionization from the bulk plasma and then
   dominated by ionization from sheath accelerated secondary electrons.
   Depending on the speed of the underlying surface, the periodic
   re-ignition of the discharge can produce an oscillatory charging pattern
   on the moving surface. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Spinel-structured lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) has attracted much
   attention because of its high energy density, low cost, and
   environmental impact. In this article, structural analysis methods such
   as powder neutron diffraction (PND), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and
   high-resolution transmission and scanning electron microscopies (TEM \&
   SEM) reveal the capacity fading mechanism of LiMn2O4 as it relates to
   the mechanical degradation of the material. Micro-fractures form after
   the first charge (to 4.45 V vs. Li+/0) of a commercial lithium manganese
   oxide phase, best represented by the formula LiMn2O3.88. Diffraction
   methods show that the grain size decreases and multiple phases form
   after 850 electrochemical cycles at 0.2 C current. The microfractures
   are directly observed through microscopy studies as particle cracks
   propagate along the (1 1 1) planes, with clear lattice twisting observed
   along this direction. Long-term galvanostatic cycling results in
   increased charge-transfer resistance and capacity loss. Upon preparing
   samples with controlled oxygen contents, LiMn2O4.03 and LiMn2O3.87, the
   mechanical failure of the lithium manganese oxide can be correlated to
   the oxygen vacancies in the materials, providing guidance for better
   synthesis methods.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of one-dimensional nanostructures with specific properties
   is often hindered by difficulty in tuning the material composition
   without sacrificing morphology and material quality. Here, we present a
   simple solid state diffusion method utilizing atomic layer deposition to
   controllably alter the composition of metal oxide nanowires. This
   compositional control allows for modification of the optical,
   electronic, and electrochemical properties of the semiconductor
   nanowires. Using this method and a novel process for manganese oxide
   atomic layer deposition, we produced manganese-doped rutile TiO2
   nanowires and investigated their structural and photoelectrochemical
   properties. A homogeneous incorporation of the Mn dopant into the rutile
   lattice was observed, and the local chemical environment of the Mn was
   determined using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The doping process
   resulted in a tunable enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity for
   water oxidation, demonstrating that this simple and general method can
   be used to control the properties of one-dimensional nanostructures for
   use in a variety of applications including solar-to-fuel generation.}},

Abstract = {{The damping characteristics of an Ni-Ti shape memory alloy (SMA) beam

   identifying an appropriate damping model for the material. The SMA beam
   is manufactured by a spray deposition method followed by heat treatment

   high. The beam is then tested to obtain an impulse response and the
   frequency response function (FRF). By using the Hilbert transform
   technique it is shown that damping of the beam is almost amplitude
   independent in the tested range of displacement. It is also shown from
   the FRF that the damping of the spray-deposited shape memory alloy beam
   is well represented by a model including both linear viscous and
   hysteretic dampings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{447-460}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{A model elucidates two transport mechanisms associated with the volumes
   dissolved electrolytes occupy: the `excluded-volume effect', which
   arises when concentration polarization induces solution-density
   gradients that drive volume redistribution; and `Faradaic convection',
   which occurs when interfacial electrochemical reactions induce bulk
   flow. The excluded-volume effect can be accounted for in Newman's
   concentrated-solution theory by incorporating a thermodynamic state
   equation that describes the solution's local molar volume. Faradaic
   convection is introduced through boundary conditions that include
   volume-average velocity, which is distributed throughout a solution by a
   volume-balance governing equation. Two dimensionless parameters quantify
   the importances of these phenomena, which prove relevant when modeling
   nonaqueous electrolytes. Analytical formulas are derived to describe
   concentration polarization and diffusion potentials in
   parallel-electrode cells undergoing symmetric ion-deposition/stripping
   half-reactions. In moderately concentrated nonaqueous electrolytes,
   Faradaic convection elevates limiting currents by as much as ten percent
   above those predicted by a theory neglecting it. The excluded-volume
   effect similarly impacts diffusion potentials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, we developed a statistical rib cage geometry model
   accounting for variations by age, sex, stature and body mass index
   (BMI). Thorax CT scans were obtained from 89 subjects approximately
   evenly distributed among 8 age groups and both sexes. Threshold-based CT
   image segmentation was performed to extract the rib geometries, and a
   total of 464 landmarks on the left side of each subject's ribcage were
   collected to describe the size and shape of the rib cage as well as the
   cross-sectional geometry of each rib. Principal component analysis and
   multivariate regression analysis were conducted to predict rib cage
   geometry as a function of age, sex, stature, and BMI, all of which
   showed strong effects on rib cage geometry. Except for BMI, all
   parameters also showed significant effects on rib cross-sectional area
   using a linear mixed model. This statistical rib cage geometry model can
   serve as a geometric basis for developing a parametric human thorax
   finite element model for quantifying effects from different human
   attributes on thoracic injury risks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Compound semiconductors are the basis for many of the highest
   performance optical and electronic devices in use today. Their
   widespread commercial application has, however, been limited due to the
   high cost of substrates. Device costs can be significantly reduced if
   the substrate is reused in a simple, totally non-destructive and rapid
   process. Here, a method that allows the indefinite reuse and recycling
   of wafers is demonstrated, employing a combination of epitaxial
   ``protection layers{''}, plasma cleaning techniques that return the
   wafers to their original, pristine, and epi-ready condition following
   epitaxial layer removal, and adhesive-free bonding to a secondary
   plastic substrate. The generality of this process is demonstrated by
   fabricating high performance GaAs-based photovoltaic cells, light
   emitting diodes, and metal-semiconductor field effect transistors that
   are transferred without loss of performance onto flexible and
   lightweight plastic substrates, and then the parent wafer is recycled
   for subsequent growth of additional device layers. This process
   potentially leads to a transformational change in device cost, arising
   from the inevitable consumption of the wafer that accompanies
   conventional epitaxial liftoff followed by chemo-mechanical polishing.}},

Title = {{Switchable Scattering Meta-Surfaces for Broadband Terahertz Modulation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Active tuning and switching of electromagnetic properties of materials
   is of great importance for controlling their interaction with
   electromagnetic waves. In spite of their great promise, previously
   demonstrated reconfigurable metamaterials are limited in their operation
   bandwidth due to their resonant nature. Here, we demonstrate a new class
   of meta-surfaces that exhibit electrically-induced switching in their
   scattering parameters at room temperature and over a broad range of
   frequencies. Structural configuration of the subwavelength
   meta-molecules determines their electromagnetic response to an incident
   electromagnetic radiation. By reconfiguration of the meta-molecule
   structure, the strength of the induced electric field and magnetic field
   in the opposite direction to the incident fields are varied and the
   scattering parameters of the meta-surface are altered, consequently. We
   demonstrate a custom-designed meta-surface with switchable scattering
   parameters at a broad range of terahertz frequencies, enabling terahertz
   intensity modulation with record high modulation depths and modulation
   bandwidths through a fully integrated, voltage-controlled device
   platform at room temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Glow discharge plasma was successfully applied for effective removal of
   the organic template P-123 from SBA-15 ordered mesoporous silica at
   near-room-temperature (below 50 degrees C) and in a short operation time
   (2 h). The as-made SBA-15 treated with glow discharge exhibited a larger
   surface area of 1025 m(2) g(-1) with larger pores and microspore volume
   as compared with that of conventional calcination (550 degrees C and 5
   h, 827 m(2) g(-1)). In addition to less structural shrinkage, the
   plasma-prepared SBA-15 showed significantly increased silanol density
   from 5.4 to 6.6-7.6 mmol g(-1), which led directly to higher amine
   loading from 1.8 to 3.0 mmol g(-1). Consequently, the plasma-treated
   sample showed 77\% more CO2 capacity and 60\% higher CO2/N-2 selectivity
   than the conventionally treated sample at 0.15 bar and 25 degrees C. The
   advantage of using glow discharge plasma for low-temperature template
   removal for achieving enhanced performance for CO2 adsorption is clearly
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{PAHs in the Great Lakes basin are of concern due to their toxicity and
   persistence in bottom sediments. Their nitro derivatives, nitro-PAHs
   (NPAHs), which can have stronger carcinogenic and mutagenic activity
   than parent PAHs, may follow similar transport routes and also are
   accumulated in sediments. Limited information exists regarding the
   current distribution, trends and loadings of these compounds, especially
   NPAHs, in Lake Michigan sediments. This study characterizes PAHs, NPAHs,
   and biomarkers steranes and hopanes in surface sediments collected at 24
   offshore sites in southern Lake Michigan. The Sigma PAH(14) (sum of 14
   compounds) ranged from 213 to 1291 ng/g dry weight (dw) across the
   sites, levels that are 2 to 10 times lower than those reported 20 to 30
   years earlier. Compared to consensus-based sediment quality guidelines,
   PAH concentrations suggest very low risk to benthic organisms. The Sigma
   NPAH(5) concentration ranged from 2.9 to 18.6 ng/g dw, and included
   carcinogenic compounds 1-nitropyrene and 6-nitrochrysene. Sigma
   Sterane(6) and Sigma Hopane(5) concentrations ranged from 6.2 to 36 and
   98 to 355 ng/g dw, respectively. Based on these concentrations, Lake
   Michigan is approximately receiving 11, 0.16, 0.25 and 3.6 metric tons
   per year (t/yr) of Sigma PAH(14), Sigma NPAH(5), Sigma Sterane(6) and
   Sigma Hopanes(5), respectively. Maps of OC-adjusted concentrations
   display that concentrations decline with increasing off-shore distance.
   The major sources of PAHs and NPAHs are pyrogenic in nature, based on
   diagnostic ratios. Using chemical mass balance models, sources were
   apportioned to emissions from diesel engines (56 +/- 18\%), coal power
   plants (27 +/- 14\%), coal-tar pavement sealants (16 +/- 11\%), and coke
   ovens (7 +/- 12\%). The biomarkers identify a combination of petrogenic
   and biogenic sources, with the southern end of the lake more impacted by
   petroleum. This first report of NPAH levels in sediments of Lake
   Michigan reveals several carcinogenic compounds at modest
   concentrations, and a need for further work to assess potential risks to
   aquatic organisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   electrochemistry-based impedance model for lithium-ion batteries to
   better understand the relationship between battery internal dynamics and

   particle model which balances between simplicity and accuracy. The model
   includes electrochemical impedance due to charge-transfer reaction,
   diffusion dynamics in the electrodes, effects of ion concentration,
   capacitance dispersion in the double layer, and anode insulating film
   growth, etc. The impedance tests for model validation were performed on
   two lithium-ion cells at ambient temperature and at different SOC
   levels. A particle swarm optimization method is employed to identify
   model parameters. The model accuracy under different conditions is
   compared with that of conventional Randles model and the parameter
   variations at different stage of the aging process are studied. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Open-circuit-voltage (OCV) data is widely used for characterizing
   battery properties under different conditions. It contains important
   information that can help to identify battery state-of-charge (SOC) and
   state-of-health (SOH). While various OCV models have been developed for
   battery SOC estimation, few have been designed for SOH monitoring. In
   this paper, we propose a unified OCV model that can be applied for both
   SOC estimation and SOH monitoring. Improvements in SOC estimation using
   the new model compared to other existing models are demonstrated.
   Moreover, it is shown that the proposed OCV model can be used to perform
   battery SOH monitoring as it effectively captures aging information
   based on incremental capacity analysis (ICA). Parametric analysis and
   model complexity reduction are also addressed. Experimental data is used
   to illustrate the effectiveness of the model and its simplified version
   in the application context of SOC estimation and SOH monitoring. (C)

Abstract = {{The phase diagram of the Bi/GaSb surface reconstructions has been
   established using density functional theory and cluster expansion
   computational methods. The predominant reconstructions in the alloy
   system are the same as those found for pure GaSb. That is, the (4 x 3)
   family of reconstructions dominate the phase diagram. However, at low Sb
   and Bi chemical potentials, the calculations predict a (2 x 1) structure
   for both GaSb and Bi/GaSb. It is found that Bi does not stabilize any
   additional structures, and Bi does not readily incorporate into the
   surface in the presence of Sb. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Controlling the number of graphene sheets exfoliated from graphite by
   designed normal loading and frictional motion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{We use molecular dynamics to study the exfoliation of patterned
   nanometer-sized graphite under various normal loading conditions for
   friction-induced exfoliation. Using highly ordered pyrolytic graphite
   (HOPG) as well as both amorphous and crystalline SiO2 substrate as
   example systems, we show that the exfoliation process is attributed to
   the corrugation of the HOPG surface and the atomistic roughness of the
   substrate when they contact under normal loading. The critical normal
   strain, at which the exfoliation occurs, is higher on a crystalline
   substrate than on an amorphous substrate. This effect is related to the
   atomistic flatness and stiffness of the crystalline surface. We observe
   that an increase of the van der Waals interaction between the graphite
   and the substrate results in a decrease of the critical normal strain
   for exfoliation. We find that the magnitude of the normal strain can
   effectively control the number of exfoliated graphene layers. This
   mechanism suggests a promising approach of applying designed normal
   loading while sliding to pattern controlled number of graphene layers or
   other two-dimensional materials on a substrate surface. (C) 2014 AIP

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{In our companion paper (Paper I) {[}C. K. Renshaw and S. R. Forrest,
   Phys. Rev. B 90, 045302 (2014)], we developed a model for charge
   transport and photogeneration at hybrid organic/inorganic semiconductor
   heterojunctions (OI-HJs). Here we apply the model to two planar bilayer
   hybrid photovoltaic devices: the first using the wide-band gap n-TiO2 in
   combination with the hole transporting tetraphenyl-dibenzoperiflanthene
   (DBP), and the second based on the moderate-band gap n-InP and the hole
   transporting pentacene (PEN). We measure the external quantum efficiency
   (EQE) and current density vs voltage (J -V) characteristics of both
   devices as functions of temperature. The EQE spectra for both TiO2/DBP
   and InP/PEN provide convincing evidence that Frenkel states generated in
   the organic form hybrid charge transfer excitons (HCTEs) at the OI-HJ
   that are subsequently dissociated into free charges, and then collected
   at the opposing electrodes. The dissociation efficiency is found to be
   strongly influenced by the presence of surface states, particularly in
   the InP/PEN device. We further develop the J -V model from Paper I to
   include an analytical expression for space-charge effects in the organic
   at high currents. Model fits to the J -V data suggest that the
   temperature-dependent hole mobilities in both DBP and PEN result in
   increasing space-charge effects at low temperatures. Furthermore, we
   find that the J -V characteristics of the TiO2/DBP device both in the
   dark and under illumination are governed by interface recombination. In
   contrast, the dark current in the InP/PEN device is governed by
   injection over the OI-HJ barrier, whereas the photocurrent is dominated
   by interface recombination. This work elucidates the role of the HCTE
   state in photogeneration, and the applicability of our model to a range
   of important optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{The different cohesive forces that bond organic (i.e. excitonic) and
   inorganic semiconductors lead to widely disparate dielectric constants,
   charge mobilities, and other fundamental optoelectronic properties that
   make junctions between these materials interesting for numerous
   practical applications. Yet, there are no detailed theories addressing
   charge and energy transport across interfaces between these hybrid
   systems. Here, we develop a comprehensive physical model describing
   charge transport and photocurrent generation based on first-principles
   charge and excited state dynamics at the organic/inorganic
   heterojunction. We consider interfaces that are trap-free, as well as
   those with an exponential distribution of trap states. We find that the
   hybrid charge-transfer state resulting from photon absorption near the
   junction that subsequently migrates to the heterointerface is often
   unstable at room temperature, leading to its rapid dissociation into
   free charges that are collected at the device contacts. In the companion
   Paper II {[}A. Panda et al., Phys. Rev. B 90, 045303 (2014)], we apply
   our theories to understanding the optical and electronic properties of
   archetype organic/inorganic heterojunction diodes. Our analysis provides
   insights for developing high performance optoelectronic devices whose
   properties are otherwise inaccessible to either conventional excitonic
   or inorganic semiconductor junctions.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{This work presents the first comprehensive investigation of
   phonon-electron interactions in bulk acoustic standing wave (BAW)
   resonators made from piezoelectric semiconductor (PS) materials. We show
   that these interactions constitute a significant energy loss mechanism
   and can set practical loss limits lower than anharmonic phonon
   scattering limits or thermoelastic damping limits. Secondly, we
   theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that phonon-electron
   interactions, under appropriate conditions, can result in a significant
   acoustic gain manifested as an improved quality factor (Q). Measurements
   on GaN resonators are consistent with the presented interaction model
   and demonstrate up to 35\% dynamic improvement in Q. The strong
   dependencies of electron-mediated acoustic loss/gain on resonance
   frequency and material properties are investigated. Piezoelectric
   semiconductors are an extremely important class of electromechanical
   materials, and this work provides crucial insights for material choice,
   material properties, and device design to achieve low-loss PS-BAW
   resonators along with the unprecedented ability to dynamically tune
   resonator Q.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{We present a 1550 nm plasmonic photomixer operating under pumping duty
   cycles below 10\%, which offers significantly higher terahertz radiation
   power levels compared to previously demonstrated photomixers. The
   record-high terahertz radiation powers are enabled by enhancing the
   device quantum efficiency through use of plasmonic contact electrodes,
   and by mitigating thermal breakdown at high optical pump power levels
   through use of a low duty cycle optical pump. The repetition rate of the
   optical pump can be specifically selected at a given pump duty cycle to
   control the spectral linewidth of the generated terahertz radiation. At
   an average optical pump power of 150 mW with a pump modulation frequency
   of 1 MHz and pump duty cycle of 2\%, we demonstrate up to 0.8 mW
   radiation power at 1 THz, within each continuous wave radiation cycle.

Abstract = {{To obtain predictive modeling of the spacecraft, we investigate the
   effects of adding cables to a simple structure with the goal of
   developing an understanding of the effects of cables interacting with a
   structure. In this paper, we present modeling of a cable-harnessed
   structure by means of the Spectral Element Method (SEM). A double beam
   model is used to emulate a cable-harnessed structure. SEM modeling can
   define the location and the number of connections between the two beams
   in a convenient fashion. The presented modeling is applied and compared
   with the conventional FEM. The modeling approach was compared and
   validated with experimental measurements. The validated modeling was
   implemented to investigate the effect of the number of connections and
   of the spring stiffness of interconnections. The results show that the
   proposed modeling can be used as an accurate and efficient solution
   methodology for a cable-harnessed structure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Number = {{7, SI}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces a class of finite-horizon dynamic optimization
   problems that are called multi-action stochastic Dynamic Programs (DPs).
   Their distinguishing feature is that the decision in each state is a
   multi-dimensional vector. These problems can in principle be solved
   using Bellman's backward recursion. However, the complexity of this
   procedure grows exponentially in the dimension of the decision vectors.
   This is called the curse of action space dimensionality. To overcome
   this computational challenge, an approximation algorithm is proposed
   that is rooted in the game-theoretic paradigm of Sampled Fictitious Play
   (SFP). SFP solves a sequence of DPs with a one-dimensional action space
   that are exponentially smaller than the original multi-action stochastic
   DP. In particular, the computational effort in a fixed number of SFP
   iterations is linear in the dimension of the decision vectors. It is
   shown that the sequence of SFP iterates converges to a local optimum,
   and a numerical case study in manufacturing is presented in which SFP is
   able to find solutions with objective values within 1\% of the optimal
   objective value hundreds of times faster than the time taken by backward
   recursion. In this case study, SFP solutions are also better by a
   statistically significant margin than those found by a one-step look
   ahead heuristic.}},

Abstract = {{To accelerate the pace of materials discovery and application,
   comprehensive links need to be established between a material's
   structure, properties, and process conditions used to obtain the
   material and/or final application format. This work examines the dry
   printing of pentacene thin film transistor (TFT) channels by guard
   flow-enhanced organic vapor jet printing (GF-OVJP), a technique that
   enables direct, solvent-free, additive patterning of device-quality
   molecular semiconductors in air. Deposition in air entails non-trivial
   effects at the boundary between ambient surroundings and the gas jet
   carrying the semiconductor vapor that influence the morphology and
   properties of the resulting electronic devices. Synchrotron X-ray
   diffraction is employed, complemented by measurement of electronic
   properties of GF-OVJP deposited films in a TFT to reveal how the
   morphology and electronic properties of the films depend on thickness,
   location within the printed pattern, nozzle translation velocity, and
   other process parameters. The hole field-effect mobility of the printed
   pentacene film is linked quantitatively with its crystallinity, as well
   as with extent of exposure to ambient air during deposition. The
   analysis can be extended to accurately predict the performance of
   devices deposited in air by GF-OVJP, which are demonstrated here for a
   planar, large area deposit.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an element-local algebraic approach to constructing
   coarse spaces for p-multigrid solvers and preconditioners of high-order
   discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. The target class of problems is
   convective systems on unstructured meshes, a class for which traditional
   p-multigrid typically fails to reach textbook multigrid efficiency due
   to a mismatch between smoothers and coarse spaces. Smoothers that
   attempt to alleviate this mismatch, such as line-implicit, incomplete
   LU, or Gauss-Seidel, deteriorate on grids that are not aligned with the
   flow, and they rely on sequential operations that do not scale well to
   distributed-memory architectures. In this work we shift attention from
   the smoothers to the coarse spaces, and we present an algebraic
   definition of the coarse spaces within each element based on a
   singular-value decomposition of the neighbor influence matrix. On each
   multigrid level, we employ a block-Jacobi smoother, which maintains
   algorithmic scalability as all elements can be updated in parallel. We
   demonstrate the performance of our solver on discretizations of
   advection and the linearized compressible Euler equations. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The use of multi-scale mathematical and computational models to study
   complex biological processes is becoming increasingly productive.
   Multi-scale models span a range of spatial and/or temporal scales and
   can encompass multi-compartment (e.g., multi-organ) models. Modeling
   advances are enabling virtual experiments to explore and answer
   questions that are problematic to address in the wet-lab. Wet-lab
   experimental technologies now allow scientists to observe, measure,
   record, and analyze experiments focusing on different system aspects at
   a variety of biological scales. We need the technical ability to mirror
   that same flexibility in virtual experiments using multi-scale models.
   Here we present a new approach, tuneable resolution, which can begin
   providing that flexibility. Tuneable resolution involves fine- or
   coarse-graining existing multi-scale models at the user's discretion,
   allowing adjustment of the level of resolution specific to a question,
   an experiment, or a scale of interest. Tuneable resolution expands
   options for revising and validating mechanistic multi-scale models, can
   extend the longevity of multi-scale models, and may increase
   computational efficiency. The tuneable resolution approach can be
   applied to many model types, including differential equation,
   agent-based, and hybrid models. We demonstrate our tuneable resolution
   ideas with examples relevant to infectious disease modeling,
   illustrating key principles at work. (C) 2014 The Authors. WIREs Systems

Title = {{Development of a Device for the Nondestructive Thermal Diffusivity
   Determination of Combustion Chamber Deposits and Thin Coatings}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{An experimental radiation chamber has been developed to nondestructively
   measure the thermal diffusivity of a combustion chamber deposit (CCD)
   layer. The accumulation of CCD shifts the operability range of
   homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) to lower loads where the
   fuel economy benefit of HCCI over a traditional spark ignition strategy
   is at a maximum. The formation and burn-off of CCD introduce operational
   variability, which increases the control system burden of a practical
   HCCI engine. To fully characterize the impact of CCD on HCCI combustion
   and develop strategies which limit the CCD imposed variability, the
   thermal and physical properties of HCCI CCD must be determined without
   destroying the morphology of the CCD layer. The radiation chamber device
   provides a controlled, inert atmosphere absent of cyclical pressure
   oscillations and fuel/air interactions found within an engine. The
   device exposes temperature probes coated with CCD to controlled heat
   flux pulses generated by a graphite emitter and a rotating disk. CCD
   layer thermal diffusivity is then calculated based on the phase delay of
   the sub-CCD temperature response relative to the response of the
   temperature probe when clean. This work validates the accuracy of the
   radiation chamber's diffusivity determination methodology by testing
   materials of known properties. Wafers of three different materials,
   whose thermal diffusivities span two orders of magnitude centered on
   predicted CCD diffusivity values, are installed over the temperature
   probes to act as CCD surrogates. Multiple thicknesses of each material
   are tested over a range of heat flux pulse durations. Diffusivity values
   determined from radiation chamber testing are independent of sample
   thickness with each of the three calibration materials. The radiation
   chamber diffusivity values exhibit a slight, but consistent
   underprediction for all wafers due to residual contact resistance at the
   wafer-probe interface. Overall, the validation studies establish the
   radiation chamber as an effective device for the nondestructive thermal
   diffusivity determination of thin insulative coatings. The similarity of
   expected CCD diffusivity values to those of the validation specimens
   instills confidence that the methodology and device presented herein can
   be successfully utilized in the characterization of HCCI CCD layers.}},

Abstract = {{Rotation matrices, which are three-by-three orthonormal matrices with
   determinant equal to plus one, constitute the special orthogonal group
   of rigid-body rotations, denoted SO(3). Owing to the three-by-three
   nature of rotation matrices plus their orthonormality constraint,
   parameterizations are often used in favor of rotation matrices for
   computations and derivations. For example, Euler angles and Rodrigues
   parameters are common three-parameter unconstrained parameterizations,
   while unit-length quaternions are a popular four-parameter constrained
   parameterization. In this paper various identities associated with the
   parameterization of SO(3) are considered. In particular, we present six
   identities, three related to unconstrained parameterizations and three
   related to constrained parameterizations. We also discuss rotation
   matrix perturbations. The utility of these identities is highlighted
   when deriving the motion equations of a rigid body using Lagrange's
   equation. We also use them to examine some issues associated with
   spacecraft attitude determination.}},

   addressed: 1) unsynchronized updates of the two GPS receivers and 2)
   significant delays in GPS velocity measurement. A stochastic
   observability analysis reveals that the proposed method guarantees the
   observability when a vehicle has nonzero yaw rates. Experimental

Title = {{The design and applications of superomniphobic surfaces}},
Journal = {{NPG ASIA MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Surfaces that display contact angles >150 degrees along with low contact
   angle hysteresis with essentially all high and low surface tension
   liquids, including water, oils and alcohols, are known as
   superomniphobic surfaces. Such surfaces have a range of commercial
   applications, including self-cleaning, non-fouling, stain-free clothing,
   drag reduction, corrosion prevention and separation of liquids. Such
   surfaces have thus generated immense academic and industrial interest in
   recent years. In this review, we discuss the systematic design of
   superomniphobic surfaces. In particular, we discuss the significance of
   surface energy, roughness and the critical role of re-entrant texture in
   obtaining the so-called Cassie-Baxter state with low surface tension
   liquids. We also discuss how hierarchical scales of texture can yield
   high contact angles and decrease the contact angle hysteresis of
   superomniphobic surfaces by reducing the solid-liquid contact area. On
   the basis of this understanding, we discuss dimensionless design
   parameters that allow for the systematic design of superomniphobic

Abstract = {{While it is well known that growth conditions such as temperature
   greatly affect defect incorporation in thin films, less is known about
   the direct effects of the surface reconstruction. In this work, we
   examine the effect of the initial surface reconstruction on defect
   incorporation in GaSb/GaAs(001) lattice mismatched films. The stress
   built up in GaSb films grown on As-terminated and Sb-terminated GaAs was
   monitored during film growth and shows that the total relaxation is
   similar in both films along the {[}110], but lower on the Sb-terminated
   surface along the {[}1 (1) over bar0]. These differences can be
   understood by examining the ability for the two surface terminations to
   accommodate strain. The resulting films show that the density of 3D
   islands is lower for the Sb-terminated surfaces, and that lattice
   mismatch strain is further accommodated by a 5 degrees tilt. In
   contrast, the As-terminated surface contains both stacking faults and
   misfit dislocations. These results demonstrate the possibility to
   engineer specific defects into films by controlling the starting surface
   of film growth.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the role of collagen structure in corneal biomechanics,
   measurement of localized corneal elasticity with minimal destruction to
   the tissue is necessary. We adopted the recently developed acoustic
   radiation force elastic microscopy (ARFEM) technique to measure localize
   biomechanical properties of the human cornea. In ARFEM, a low-frequency,
   high-intensity acoustic force is used to displace a femtosecond
   laser-generated microbubble, while high-frequency, low-intensity
   ultrasound is used to monitor the position of the microbubble within the
   cornea. Two ex vivo human corneas from a single donor were dehydrated to
   physiologic thickness, embedded in gelatin and then evaluated using the
   ARFEM technique. In the direction perpendicular to the corneal surface,
   ARFEM measurements provided elasticity values of E 5 1.39 +/- 0.28 kPa
   for the central anterior cornea and E 5 0.71 +/- 0.21 kPa for the
   central posterior cornea in pilot studies. The increased value of
   corneal elasticity in the anterior cornea correlates with the higher
   density of interweaving lamellae in this region. (E-mail: emikula@

Abstract = {{ZnTe doped with high concentrations of oxygen has been proposed in
   previous works as an intermediate band (IB) material for photovoltaic
   applications. The existence of extra optical transitions related to the
   presence of an IB has already been demonstrated in this material and it
   has been possible to measure the absorption coefficient of the
   transitions from the valence band (VB) to the IB. In this study, we
   present the first measurement of the absorption coefficient associated
   with transitions from the IB to the conduction band (CB) in ZnTeO. The
   samples used are 4-mu m-thick ZnTe layers with or without O in a
   concentration similar to 10(19) cm(-3), which have been grown on
   semiinsulating GaAs substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The
   IB-CB absorption coefficient peaks for photon energies similar to 0.4
   eV. It is extracted from reflectance and transmittance spectra measured
   using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Under typical FTIR
   measurement conditions (low light intensity, broadband spectrum), the
   absorption coefficient in IB-to-CB transitions reaches 700 cm(-1). This
   is much weaker than the one observed for VB-IB absorption. This result
   is consistent with the fact that the IB is expected to be nearly empty
   of electrons under equilibrium conditions in ZnTe(O).}},

   microstructures}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The skins of many plants and animals have intricate microscale surface
   features that give rise to properties such as directed water repellency
   and adhesion, camouflage, and resistance to fouling. However, engineered
   mimicry of these designs has been restrained by the limited capabilities
   of top-down fabrication processes. Here we demonstrate a new technique
   for scalable manufacturing of freeform microstructures via
   strain-engineered growth of aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Offset
   patterning of the CNT growth catalyst is used to locally modulate the
   CNT growth rate. This causes the CNTs to collectively bend during
   growth, with exceptional uniformity over large areas. The final shape of
   the curved CNT microstructures can be designed via finite element
   modeling, and compound catalyst shapes produce microstructures with
   multidirectional curvature and unusual self-organized patterns.
   Conformal coating of the CNTs enables tuning of the mechanical
   properties independently from the microstructure geometry, representing
   a versatile principle for design and manufacturing of complex
   microstructured surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Land-surface models use different formulations of stomatal conductance
   and plant hydraulics, and it is unclear which type of model best matches
   the observed surface-atmosphere water flux. We use the North American
   Carbon Program data set of latent heat flux (LE) measurements from 25
   sites and predictions from 9 models to evaluate models' ability to
   resolve subdaily dynamics of transpiration. Despite overall good
   forecast at the seasonal scale, the models have difficulty resolving the
   dynamics of intradaily hysteresis. The majority of models tend to
   underestimate LE in the prenoon hours and overestimate in the evening.
   We hypothesize that this is a result of unresolved afternoon stomatal
   closure due to hydrodynamic stresses. Although no model or stomata
   parameterization was consistently best or worst in terms of ability to
   predict LE, errors in model-simulated LE were consistently largest and
   most variable when soil moisture was moderate and vapor pressure deficit
   was moderate to limiting. Nearly all models demonstrate a tendency to
   underestimate the degree of maximum hysteresis which, across all sites
   studied, is most pronounced during moisture-limited conditions. These
   diurnal error patterns are consistent with models' diminished ability to
   accurately simulate the natural hysteresis of transpiration. We propose
   that the lack of representation of plant hydrodynamics is, in part,
   responsible for these error patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The effective navigation, mining, and analysis of large time series data
   sets presents a recurring challenge throughout heliophysics.
   Audification, a specific form of auditory analysis commonly used in
   other fields of research (such as geoseismology), provides a promising
   technique for the evaluation of spectral features in long heliospheric
   time series data sets. Following a standard research methodology for the
   development of new analysis techniques, this paper presents a detailed
   case study in which audification was introduced into the working process
   of an experienced heliophysics research scientist and used for the
   identification and classification of features in high-resolution
   magnetometer data during a structured analysis task. Auditory evaluation
   successfully led to the detection of artificial, instrument-induced
   noise that was not previously observed by the scientist and also the
   identification of wave activity embedded within turbulent solar wind
   data. A follow-up interview indicated that the scientist continued using
   these auditory analysis methods in the assessment of every large data
   set during the 2 months after the study was completed. These findings
   indicate that audification can be valuable and enabling for researchers
   in forming a deeper understanding of both microstructures and
   macrostructures within large time series. Additionally, as both a
   standalone methodology and a supplement to visual analysis methods,
   audification can expedite certain stages of the data survey, analysis,
   and mining process and provide new qualitative insight into the spectral
   content of time-varying signals.}},

   detection}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Nearly all existing nanoelectronic sensors are based on charge
   detection, where molecular binding changes the charge density of the
   sensor and leads to sensing signal. However, intrinsically slow dynamics
   of interface-trapped charges and defect-mediated charge-transfer
   processes significantly limit those sensors' response to tens to
   hundreds of seconds, which has long been known as a bottleneck for
   studying the dynamics of molecule-nanomaterial interaction and for many
   applications requiring rapid and sensitive response. Here we report a
   fundamentally different sensing mechanism based on molecular dipole
   detection enabled by a pioneering graphene nanoelectronic heterodyne
   sensor. The dipole detection mechanism is confirmed by a plethora of
   experiments with vapour molecules of various dipole moments,
   particularly, with cis-and trans-isomers that have different polarities.
   Rapid (down to similar to 0.1 s) and sensitive (down to similar to 1
   ppb) detection of a wide range of vapour analytes is achieved,
   representing orders of magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art
   nanoelectronics sensors.}},

   variety of data types stored, and the variety of query interfaces
   presented by those systems. Furthermore, real clouds are never perfectly

Abstract = {{Conjugated polymer actuators have potential use in implantable neural
   interface devices for modulating the position of electrode sites within
   brain tissue or guiding insertion of neural probes along curved
   trajectories. The actuation of polypyrrole (PPy) doped with
   dodecylbenzenesulfonate (DBS) is characterized to ascertain whether it
   can be employed in the cerebral environment. Microfabricated bilayer
   beams are electrochemically cycled at either 22 or 37 degrees C in
   aqueous NaDBS or in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). Nearly all
   the ions in aCSF are exchanged into the PPy-the cations Na+, K+, Mg2+,
   Ca2+, as well as the anion PO43-; Cl- is not present. Nevertheless,
   deflections in aCSF are comparable to those in NaDBS and they are
   monotonic with oxidation level: strain increases upon reduction, with no
   reversal of motion despite the mixture of ionic charges and valences
   being exchanged. Actuation depends on temperature. Upon warming, the
   cyclic voltammograms show additional peaks and an increase of 70\% in
   the consumed charge. Bending is, however, much less affected: strain
   increases somewhat (6\%-13\%) but remains monotonic, and deflections
   shift (up to 20\%). These results show how the actuation environment
   must be taken into account, and demonstrate proof of concept for
   actuated implantable neural interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Regulators of peri-implant bone loss in patients with
   diabetes appear to involve multiple risk factors that have not been
   clearly elucidated. This study was conducted to explore putative local
   etiologic factors on implant bone loss in relation to type 2 diabetes
   mellitus, including clinical, microbial, salivary biomarker, and
   psychosocial factors.
   Materials and methods: Thirty-two subjects (divided into type 2 diabetes
   mellitus and non-diabetic controls), having at least one functional
   implant and six teeth, were enrolled in a 1-year longitudinal
   investigation. Analyses of clinical measurements and standardized
   intra-oral radiographs, saliva and serum biomarkers (via protein arrays
   for 20 selected markers), and plaque biofilm (via qPCR for eight
   periodontal pathogens) were performed at baseline and 1 year. In
   addition, the subjects were asked to respond to questionnaires to assess
   behavioral and psychosocial variables.
   Results: There was a significant increase from baseline to 1 year in the
   probing depth of implants in the diabetes group (1.95 mm to 2.35 mm, P =
   0.015). The average radiographic bone loss during the study period
   marginally increased at dental implants compared to natural teeth over
   the study period (0.08 mm vs. 0.05 mm; P = 0.043). The control group
   harbored higher levels of Treponema denticola at their teeth at baseline
   (P = 0.046), and the levels of the pathogen increased significantly over
   time around the implants of the same group (P = 0.003). Salivary
   osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels were higher in the diabetes group than the
   control group at baseline only; in addition, the salivary levels of
   IL-4, IL-10, and OPG associated with host defense were significantly
   reduced in the diabetes group (P = 0.010, P = 0.019, and P = 0.024),
   while controls showed an increase in the salivary OPG levels (P =
   0.005). For psychosocial factors, there were not many significant
   changes over the observation period, except for some findings related to
   coping behaviors at baseline.
   Conclusions: The study suggests that the clinical, microbiological,
   salivary biomarker, and psychosocial profiles of dental implant patients
   with type 2 diabetes who are under good metabolic control and regular
   maintenance care are very similar to those of non-diabetic individuals.
   Future studies are warranted to validate the findings in longer-term and
   larger clinical trials (ClinicalTrials. gov \# NCT00933491).}},

Abstract = {{Methods capable of exhaustively screening for crystal polymorphism
   remain an elusive goal in solid-state chemistry. Particularly promising
   among the new generation of approaches is polymer-induced
   heteronucleation (PIHn), a tool utilizing hundreds of unique polymers
   for granting kinetic access to polymorphs. Here PIHn is redeployed in a
   high density format in which 288 distinct polymers, each acting as a
   heteronucleant, are arrayed on one substrate. This format allows
   determining the outcome of thousands of crystallizations in an automated
   fashion with only a few milligrams of sample. This technology enables
   the study of a broader range of targets, including preclinicaI
   candidates, facilitating determination of polymorphism propensity much
   earlier in the drug development process. Here the efficacy of this
   approach is demonstrated using four pharmaceutically relevant compounds:
   acetaminophen, tolfenamic acid, ROY, and curcumin.}},

Abstract = {{A broadband absorber based on a tapered alternating metal-dielectric
   multilayered structure was realized in the visible and IR range. The
   structure is fabricated by using a versatile method easily scalable to
   large areas by taking advantage of the line width reduction that occurs
   naturally in masked evaporation processes. The multilayered structure
   can be treated as a hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM), and the tapered
   structure can be regarded as a HMM waveguide with varying width. Light
   couples into the tapered structure most strongly at the mode cutoff
   position in the waveguide due to hyperbolic dispersion and the phase
   matching condition. Resonant cavities are formed between the top of the
   tapered structure and the cutoff level, producing strong absorption
   peaks. These resonances are closely spaced spectrally due to the high k
   modes in HMM. Finally a broad absorption is formed due to the broadening
   of the resonances from an array of coupled HMM tapered structures.}},

Abstract = {{The enzymes involved in the initial steps of anaerobic benzene
   catabolism are not known. To try to elucidate this critical step, a
   metatranscriptomic analysis was conducted to compare the genes
   transcribed during the metabolism of benzene and benzoate by an
   anaerobic benzene-degrading, nitrate-reducing enrichment culture. RNA
   was extracted from the mixed culture and sequenced without prior mRNA
   enrichment, allowing simultaneous examination of the active community
   composition and the differential gene expression between the two
   treatments. Ribosomal and mRNA sequences attributed to a member of the
   family Peptococcaceae from the order Clostridiales were essentially only
   detected in the benzene-amended culture samples, implicating this group
   in the initial catabolism of benzene. Genes similar to each of two
   subunits of a proposed benzene-carboxylating enzyme were transcribed
   when the culture was amended with benzene. Anaerobic benzoate
   degradation genes from strict anaerobes were transcribed only when the
   culture was amended with benzene. Genes for other benzoate catabolic
   enzymes and for nitrate respiration were transcribed in both samples,
   with those attributed to an Azoarcus species being most abundant. These
   findings indicate that the mineralization of benzene starts with its
   activation by a strict anaerobe belonging to the Peptococcaceae,
   involving a carboxylation step to form benzoate. These data confirm the
   previously hypothesized syntrophic association between a
   benzene-degrading Peptococcaceae strain and a benzoate-degrading
   denitrifying Azoarcus strain for the complete catabolism of benzene with
   nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a non-contact on-wafer S-parameter measurement
   method for submillimeter-wave and terahertz frequency range. The
   proposed method is based on using open-ended waveguide probes along with
   on-wafer wave-guide transitions to measure the S-parameters of waveguide
   based components and devices. To enable non-contact measurements, an RF
   choke is designed and machined on the metallic cross section of the
   probes using electric discharge machining. Additionally, to enhance the
   accuracy and repeatability of the measurements, a probe aligner is
   micromachined over the on-wafer transition. In order to validate the
   measurement concept, a full-band transition operating at J-band (220-325
   GHz) is designed and tested. To achieve high accuracy, the fabrication
   of the on-wafer waveguide and the transition is performed using silicon
   micromachining. It is shown that the designed back-to-back transition
   has a return loss of better than 15 dB and an insertion loss of less
   than 0.2 dB over the entire frequency band. The measurement results of
   the fabricated transition also show a good agreement with the simulated
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Background The ability to engage in a creative process to solve a
   problem or to design a novel artifact is essential to engineering as a
   profession. Research indicates a need for curricula that enhance
   students' creative skills in engineering.
   Purpose Our purpose was to document current practices in engineering
   pedagogy with regard to opportunities for students' creative growth by
   examining learning goals, instructional methods, and assessments focused
   on cognitive creative skills.
   Design/Method We conducted a critical case study of engineering pedagogy
   at a single university with seven engineering courses where instructors
   stated the goal of fostering creativity. Data included instructor and
   student interviews, student surveys, and course materials. For
   qualitative analysis, we used frameworks by Treffinger, Young, Selby,
   and Shepardson and by Wiggins and McTighe.
   Results One aspect of creativity, convergent thinking (including
   analysis and evaluation), was well represented in the engineering
   courses in our case study. However, instruction on generating ideas and
   openness to exploring ideas was less often evident. For many of the
   creative skills, especially those related to divergent thinking and idea
   exploration, assessments were lacking.
   Conclusions An analysis of pedagogy focused on goals, instruction, and
   assessments in the engineering curriculum revealed opportunities for
   growth in students' creative skill development. Designing assessments
   that motivate students to improve their creative skills and to become
   more aware of their own creative process is a key need in engineering
   pedagogy.}},

Abstract = {{A novel three degree-of-freedom microactuator based on thin-film
   lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) is described with its detailed structural
   model. Its central rectangular-shaped mirror platform, also referred to
   as the stage, is actuated by four symmetric PZT bending legs such that
   each leg provides vertical translation for one corner of the stage. It
   has been developed to support real-time in vivo vertical cross-sectional
   imaging with a dual axes confocal endomicroscope for early cancer
   detection, having large displacements in three axes (z, theta(x),
   theta(y)) and a relatively high bandwidth in the z-axis direction.
   Prototype microactuators closely meet the performance requirements for
   this application; in the out-of-plane (z-axis) direction, it has shown
   more than 177 mu m of displacement and about 84 Hz of structural natural
   frequency, when two diagonal legs are actuated at 14V. With all four
   legs, another prototype of the same design with lighter stage mass has
   achieved more than 430 mu m of out-of-plane displacement at 15V and
   about 200 Hz of bandwidth. The former design has shown approximately 6.4
   degrees and 2.9 degrees of stage tilting about the x-axis and y-axis,
   respectively, at 14V. This paper also presents a modeling technique that
   uses experimental data to account for the effects of fabrication
   uncertainties in residual stress and structural dimensions. The
   presented model predicts the static motion of the stage within an
   average absolute error of 14.6 mu m, which approaches the desired
   imaging resolution, 5 mu m, and also reasonably anticipates the
   structural dynamic behavior of the stage. The refined model will support
   development of a future trajectory tracking controller for the system.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the accuracy of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD)
   simulations of polymers in dilute solutions with hydrodynamic
   interaction (HI), at the theta point, modeled by setting the DPD
   conservative interaction between beads to zero. We compare the first
   normal-mode relaxation time extracted from the DPD simulations with
   theoretical predictions from a normal-mode analysis for theta chains. We
   characterize the influence of bead inertia within the coil by a ratio
   L-m/R-g, where L-m is the ballistic distance over which bead inertia is
   lost, and R-g is the radius of gyration of the polymer coil, while the
   HI strength per bead h{*} is determined by the ratio of bead
   hydrodynamic radius (r(H)) to the equilibrium spring length. We show how
   to adjust h{*} through the spring length and monomer mass, and how to
   optimize the accuracy of DPD for fixed h{*} by increasing the friction
   coefficient (gamma >= 9) and by incorporating a nonlinear distance
   dependence into the frictional interaction. Even with this optimization,
   DPD simulations exhibit deviations of over 20\% from the theoretical
   normal-mode predictions for high HI strength with h{*}>= 0.20, for
   chains with as many as 100 beads, which is a larger deviation than is

Abstract = {{This paper presents the performance of three methods for estimating the
   range of broadband (50-500 Hz) bowhead whale calls in a nominally
   55-m-deep waveguide: Conventional mode filtering (CMF), synthetic time
   reversal (STR), and triangulation. The first two methods use a linear
   vertical array to exploit dispersive propagation effects in the
   underwater sound channel. The triangulation technique used here, while
   requiring no knowledge about the propagation environment, relies on a
   distributed array of directional autonomous seafloor acoustics recorders
   (DASARs) arranged in triangular grid with 7 km spacing. This study uses
   simulations and acoustic data collected in 2010 from coastal waters near
   Kaktovik, Alaska. At that time, a 12-element vertical array, spanning
   the bottom 63\% of the water column, was deployed alongside a
   distributed array of seven DASARs. The estimated call location-to-array
   ranges determined from CMF and STR are compared with DASAR triangulation
   results for 19 whale calls. The vertical-array ranging results are
   generally within +/- 10\% of the DASAR results with the STR results
   providing slightly better agreement. The results also indicate that the
   vertical array can range calls over larger ranges and with greater
   precision than the particular distributed array discussed here, whenever
   the call locations are beyond the distributed array boundaries. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Group III nitrides are widely used in commercial visible-wavelength

   Nitride nanostructures are a promising solution to overcome these issues

   calculations based on many-body perturbation theory to study the
   electronic and optical properties of small-diameter InN nanowires. We
   show that quantum confinement in 1 nm wide InN nanowires shifts optical
   emission to the visible range at green/cyan wavelengths and inverts the
   order of the top valence bands, leading to linearly polarized
   visible-light emission. Quantum confinement on this scale also leads to
   large exciton binding energies of 1.4 eV and electronic band gaps in
   excess of 3.7 eV. Our results indicate that strong quantum confinement

Abstract = {{DNA-bridged pairs of seemingly spherical metallic nanoparticles (NPs)
   have chiral geometry due to the nonideal oblong shape of the particles

   modulation of their chiroplasmonic bands in 400-600 nm region and
   results in significantly enhanced optical activity with g-factors
   reaching 1.21 x 10(-2). The multimetal heterodimers optimized for
   coupling with the spin angular momentum of incident photons enable
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA detection at the zeptomolar
   level. This significant improvement in the sensitivity of detection is
   attributed to improvement of base pairing in the presence of NPs, low
   background for chiroplasmonic detection protocol, and enhancement of
   photon-plasmon coupling for light with helicity matching that of the
   twisted geometry of the heterodimers.}},

   EOF can also be reduced by coating the nanopore wall with an
   electrically neutral lipid bilayer, resulting in an 85\% increase in

Abstract = {{In diagnostic ultrasound, broadband transducers capable of short
   acoustic pulse emission and reception can improve axial resolution and
   provide sufficient bandwidth for harmonic imaging and multi-frequency
   excitation techniques. In histotripsy, a cavitation-based ultrasound
   therapy, short acoustic pulses (<2 cycles) can produce precise tissue
   ablation wherein lesion formation only occurs when the applied peak
   negative pressure exceeds an intrinsic threshold of the medium. This
   paper investigates a frequency compounding technique to synthesize
   nearly monopolar (half-cycle) ultrasound pulses. More specifically,
   these pulses were generated using a custom transducer composed of 23
   individual relatively-broadband piezoceramic elements with various
   resonant frequencies (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 MHz). Each frequency
   component of the transducer was capable of generating 1.5-cycle pulses
   with only one high-amplitude negative half-cycle using a custom
   23-channel high-voltage pulser. By varying time delays of individual
   frequency components to allow their principal peak negative peaks to
   arrive at the focus of the transducer constructively, destructive
   interference occurs elsewhere in time and space, resulting in a
   monopolar pulse approximation with a dominant negative phase (with
   measured peak negative pressure {[}P-]: peak positive pressure {[}P+] =
   4.68: 1). By inverting the excitation pulses to individual elements,
   monopolar pulses with a dominant positive phase can also be generated
   (with measured P+: P- = 4.74: 1). Experiments in RBC phantoms indicated
   that monopolar pulses with a dominant negative phase were able to
   produce very precise histotripsy-type lesions using the intrinsic
   threshold mechanism. Monopolar pulses with a dominant negative phase can
   inhibit shock scattering during histotripsy, leading to more predictable
   lesion formation using the intrinsic threshold mechanism, while greatly
   reducing any constructive interference, and potential hot-spots
   elsewhere. Moreover, these monopolar pulses could have many potential
   benefits in ultrasound imaging, including axial resolution improvement,
   speckle reduction, and contrast enhancement in pulse inversion imaging.}},

   tissue fractionation were created in agar-graphite tissue phantoms and
   ex vivo kidneys with increasing numbers of therapy pulses, from 0 to
   2000 pulses per treatment location. The therapy pulses were 3-cycle
   750-kHz focused ultrasound delivered at a peak negative/positive
   pressure of 17/108 MPa and a repetition rate of 50 Hz. The shear waves
   were excited by acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) focused at the
   center of the lesion. The spatial and temporal behavior of the
   propagating shear waves was measured with ultrasound plane wave imaging.
   The temporal displacement profile at a lateral location 10 mm offset to
   the shear excitation region was detected with M-mode imaging. The decay
   and delay of the shear waves were quantitatively characterized on the
   temporal displacement profile. Results showed significant changes in two
   characteristics on the temporal displacement profile: the peak-to-peak
   displacement decayed exponentially with increasing numbers of therapy
   pulses; the relative time-to-peak displacement increased with increasing
   numbers of therapy pulses, and appeared to saturate at higher numbers of
   pulses. Correspondingly, the degree of tissues fractionation, as
   indicated by the percentage of structurally intact cell nuclei,
   decreased exponentially with increasing numbers of therapy pulses.
   Strong linear correlations were found between the two characteristics
   and the degree of tissue fractionation. These results suggest that the
   characteristics of the shear temporal displacement profile may provide
   useful feedback information regarding the treatment outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Regenerative endodontic protocols recommend white mineral
   trioxide aggregate (WMTA) as a capping material because of its
   osteoinductive properties. Stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP) are
   presumed to be involved in this regenerative process, but the effects of
   WMTA on SCAP are largely unknown. Our hypothesis was that WMTA induces
   proliferation and migration of SCAP. Methods: Here we used an unsorted
   population of SCAP (passages 3-5) characterized by high CD24, CD146, and
   Stro-1 expression. The effect of WMTA on SCAP migration was assessed by
   using transwells, and its effect on proliferation was determined by the
   WST-1 assay. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and calcium chloride-enriched
   medium were used as positive controls. Results: The SCAP analyzed here
   showed a low percentage of STRO-1+ and CD24+ cells. Both set and unset
   WMTA significantly increased the short-term migration of SCAP after 6
   hours (P<.05), whereas calcium chloride enriched medium did after 24
   hours of exposure. Set WMTA significantly increased proliferation on
   days 1-5, whereas calcium-enriched medium showed a significant increase
   on day 7, with a significant reduction on proliferation afterwards. SCAP
   migration and proliferation were significantly and steadily induced by
   the presence of 2\% and 10\% FBS. Conclusions: Collectively, these data
   demonstrate that WMTA induced an early short-term migration and
   proliferation of a mixed population of stem cells from apical papilla as
   compared with a later and longer-term induction by calcium chloride or
   FBS.}},

Abstract = {{The study aimed at identifying patient-specific dosimetric and
   nondosimetric factors predicting outcome of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
   patients after I-131-tositumomab radioimmunotherapy for potential use in
   treatment planning. Methods: Tumor-absorbed dose measures were estimated
   for 130 tumors in 39 relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma
   patients by coupling SPECT/CT imaging with the Dose Planning Method
   (DPM) Monte Carlo code. Equivalent biologic effect was calculated to
   assess the biologic effects of nonuniform absorbed dose including the
   effects of the unlabeled antibody. Evaluated nondosimetric covariates
   included histology, presence of bulky disease, and prior treatment
   history. Tumor level outcome was based on volume shrinkage assessed on
   follow-up CT. Patient level outcome measures were overall response (OR),
   complete response (CR), and progression-free survival (PFS), determined
   from clinical assessments that included PET/CT. Results: The estimated
   mean tumor-absorbed dose had a median value of 275 cGy (range, 94-711
   cGy). A high correlation was observed between tracer-predicted and
   therapy-delivered mean tumor-absorbed doses (P < 0.001; r = 0.85). In
   univariate tumor-level analysis, tumor shrinkage correlated
   significantly with almost all of the evaluated dosimetric factors,
   including equivalent biologic effect. Regression analysis showed that
   OR, CR, and PFS were associated with the dosimetric factors and
   equivalent biologic effect. Both mean tumor-absorbed dose (P = 0.025)
   and equivalent biologic effect (P = 0.035) were significant predictors
   of PFS whereas none of the nondosimetric covariates were found to be
   statistically significant factors affecting PFS. The most important
   finding of the study was that in Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by mean
   dose, longer PFS was observed in patients receiving mean tumor-absorbed
   doses greater than 200 cGy than in those receiving 200 cGy or less
   (median PFS, 13.6 vs. 1.9 mo for the 2 dose groups; log-rank P <
   0.0001). Conclusion: A higher mean tumor-absorbed dose was significantly
   predictive of improved PFS after I-131-tositumomab radioimmunotherapy.
   Hence tumor-absorbed dose, which can be estimated before therapy, can
   potentially be used to design radioimmunotherapy protocols to improve
   efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{In the oral and craniofacial complex, tooth loss is the most commonly
   acquired disfiguring injury. Among the most formidable challenges of
   reconstructing tooth-supporting osseous defects in the oral cavity is
   the regeneration of functional multi-tissue complexes involving bone,
   ligament, and tooth cementum. Furthermore, periodontal multi-tissue
   engineering with spatiotemporal orientation of the periodontal ligament
   (PDL) remains the most challenging obstacle for restoration of
   physiological loading and homeostasis. We report on the ability of a
   hybrid computer-designed scaffold-developed utilizing computed
   tomography-to predictably facilitate the regeneration and integration of
   dental supporting tissues. Here, we provide the protocol for rapid
   proto-typing, manufacture, surgical implantation, and evaluation of
   dual-architecture scaffolds for controlling fiber orientation and
   facilitating morphogenesis of bone-ligament complexes. In contrast to
   conventional single-system methods of fibrous tissue formation, our
   protocol supports rigorous control of multi-compartmental scaffold
   architecture using computational scaffold design and manufacturing by 3D
   printing, as well as the evaluation of newly regenerated tissue
   physiology for clinical implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Co-culture of endothelial cells (EC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
   results in robust vascular network formation in constrained 3-D
   collagen/fibrin (COL/FIB) composite hydrogels. However, the ability to
   form endothelial networks is lost when such gels are allowed to compact
   via cell-mediated remodeling. In this study, we created co-cultures of
   human EC and human MSC in both constrained and unconstrained COL/FIB
   matrices and systematically added nanoparticulate hydroxyapatite (HA,
   0-20 mg ml(-1)), a bone-like mineral that has been shown to have
   pro-vasculogenic effects. Constructs cultured for 7 days were assayed
   for gel compaction, vascular network formation, and mechanical
   properties. In vitro, robust endothelial network formation was observed
   in constrained COL/FIB constructs without HA, but this response was
   significantly inhibited by addition of 5, 10, or 20 mg ml(-1) HA. In
   unconstrained matrices, network formation was abolished in pure COL/FIB
   constructs but was rescued by 1.25 or 2.5 mg ml(-1) HA, while higher
   levels again inhibited vasculogenesis. HA inhibited gel compaction in a
   dose-dependent manner, which was not correlated to endothelial network
   formation. HA affected initial stiffness of the gels, but gel remodeling
   abrogated this effect. Subcutaneous implantation of COL/FIB with 0, 2.5
   or 20 mg ml(-1) HA in the mouse resulted in increased perfusion at the
   implant site, with no significant differences between materials.
   Histology at day 7 showed both host and human CD31-stained vasculature
   infiltrating the implants. These findings are relevant to the design of
   materials and scaffolds for orthopedic tissue engineering, where both
   vasculogenesis and formation of a mineral phase are required for
   regeneration. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Synthetic vision systems (SVS) render terrain features for pilots
   through cockpit displays using a GPS database and three-dimensional
   graphical models. Enhanced vision systems (EVS) present infrared imagery
   of terrain using a forward-looking sensor in the nose of an aircraft.
   The ultimate goal of SVS and EVS technologies is to support pilots in
   achieving safety under low-visibility and night conditions comparable to
   clear, day conditions. This study assessed pilot performance and
   situation awareness (SA) effects of SVS and EVS imagery in an advanced
   head-up display (HUD) during a simulated landing approach under
   instrument meteorological conditions. Videos of the landing with various
   HUD configurations were presented to eight pilots with a superimposed
   tracking task. The independent variables included four HUD feature
   configurations (baseline {[} no terrain imagery], SVS, EVS, and a
   combination of SVS and EVS), two visibility conditions, and four legs of
   the flight. Results indicated that SVS increased overall SA but degraded
   flight path control performance because of visual confusion with other
   display features. EVS increased flight path control accuracy but
   decreased system (aircraft) awareness because of visual distractions.
   The combination of SVS and EVS generated offsetting effects. Display
   configurations did not affect pilot spatial awareness. Flight
   performance was not different among phases of the approach, but levels
   and types of pilot SA did vary from leg to leg. These results are
   applicable to development of adaptive HUD features to support pilot
   performance. They support the use of multidimensional measures of SA for
   insight on pilot information processing with advanced aviation displays.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model-based control strategy designed to regulate
   combustion phasing during load transitions in a recompression
   homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine. A low-order
   discrete-time control-oriented model for recompression HCCI combustion
   is developed that represents the strong thermal and composition coupling
   between engine cycles. A baseline two-input single-output controller is
   designed to regulate combustion phasing, using the amount of negative
   valve overlap and the fuel injection timing as actuators. This
   controller is augmented by a reference or fuel governor, which modifies
   transient fuel mass commands during large load transitions, when future
   actuator constraint violations are predicted. This approach is shown in
   experiments to improve combustion phasing and load responses, preventing
   engine misfires in some cases. The fuel governor enables larger load
   transitions than were possible with the baseline controller alone. The
   governor acts only when future actuator constraint violations are
   predicted. The complexity and computational overhead of the governor are
   reduced by developing a linearized fuel governor. Satisfactory
   performance is demonstrated experimentally for a range of engine speeds.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable energy resources such as wind and solar are an important
   component of a microgrid. However, the inherent intermittency and
   variability of such resources complicates microgrid operations.
   Meanwhile, more controllable loads (e.g., plug-in electric vehicles),
   distributed generators (e.g., micro gas turbines and diesel generators),
   and distributed energy storage devices (e.g., battery banks) are being
   integrated into the microgrid operation. To address the operational
   challenges associated with these technologies and energy resources, this
   paper formulates a stochastic problem for microgrid energy scheduling.
   The proposed problem formulation minimizes the expected operational cost
   of the microgrid and power losses while accommodating the intermittent
   nature of renewable energy resources. Case studies are performed on a
   modified IEEE 37-bus test feeder. The simulation results demonstrate the
   effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed stochastic microgrid energy
   scheduling model.}},

Abstract = {{To develop and test a method for measuring the relationship between the
   rise in intra-abdominal pressure and sagittal plane movements of the
   anterior and posterior vaginal walls during Valsalva in a pilot sample
   of women with and without prolapse.
   Mid-sagittal MRI images were obtained during Valsalva while changes in
   intra-abdominal pressure were measured via a bladder catheter in 5 women
   with cystocele, 5 women with rectocele, and 5 controls. The regional
   compliance of the anterior and posterior vagina wall support systems
   were estimated from the ratio of displacement (mm) of equidistant points
   along the anterior and posterior vaginal walls to intra-abdominal
   pressure rise (mmHg).
   The compliance of both anterior and posterior vaginal wall support
   systems varied along different regions of vaginal wall for all three
   groups, with the highest compliance found near the vaginal apex and the
   lowest near the introitus. Women with cystocele had more compliant
   anterior and posterior vaginal wall support systems than women with
   rectocele. The movement direction differs between cystocele and
   rectocele. In cystocele, the anterior vaginal wall moves mostly toward
   the vaginal orifice in the upper vagina, but in a ventral direction in
   the lower vagina. In rectocele, the direction of the posterior vaginal
   wall movement is generally toward the vaginal orifice.
   Movement of the vaginal wall and compliance of its support is
   quantifiable and was found to vary along the length of the vagina.
   Compliance was greatest in the upper vagina of all groups. Women with
   cystocele demonstrated the most compliant vaginal wall support.}},

Abstract = {{The thermodynamics of self-assembly have long been explored by either

   interrogates the thermodynamics of self-assembly at a liquid/solid

   analyte, analyte-solvent, analyte- substrate, and solvent-substrate
   interactions. Comparison of the experimental data with computed lattice
   energies for the relevant monolayers across a series of aliphatic
   analytes reveals similar ordering within the series, with the exceptions
   of the fatty acid and bromoalkane adsorbates. Such a discrepancy could
   arise when the lattice energies do not account for important
   interactions, such as analyte analyte interactions in solution. Flow
   microcalorimetry provides a uniquely inclusive view of the thermodynamic

Abstract = {{Terahertz sensing plays an important role in industry, biology and
   material science. Most existing techniques for terahertz detection
   either require bulky optics or need cryogenic cooling, and the uncooled
   thermal detectors usually suffer from long integration times (1-1,000
   ms). We propose, and experimentally demonstrate, a novel scheme based on
   photoacoustic detection of terahertz pulse radiation. The transient and
   localized heating in a carbon nanotube-polymer composite by the
   absorption of terahertz pulse energy produces ultrasound, which is
   subsequently detected by a highly sensitive acoustic sensor. In contrast
   to conventional thermal detectors utilizing continuous heat integration,
   this new method of terahertz detection responds to the energy of each
   individual terahertz pulse by a time-gated scheme, thus rejecting the
   continuous radiation from the ambient. In addition, this novel detector
   possesses advantages such as room-temperature operation, a fast response
   (similar to 0.1 mu s) allowing real-time detection, compact size
   (millimetre scale) and wide spectral response.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces metrics derived from application of a Markov
   decision process to evaluate a design's changeability. Changeability is
   known to improve product performance if conscientious early-stage design
   decisions are matched with structured management of the system in
   response to exogenous disturbances-shifts which may be environmental,
   market, technological, and political in nature. Included in the paper is
   a brief discussion of changeability's role in ensuring strategic product
   performance as well as a review of past metrics developed, highlighting
   the open design challenge to more fully capture the managerial and
   process dimensions inherent to changeability. The proposed metrics are
   featured in a case study related to the ballast water system of an
   ocean-going vessel. The result of such application is greater context
   for the value changeability offers and an improved understanding of the
   resources required to manage uncertainty over the product's life cycle.}},

Title = {{Macroscopic Stiffness of Breast Tumors Predicts Metastasis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of tumors differ substantially from normal cells
   and tissues. Changes in stiffness or elasticity regulate pro-metastatic
   behaviors of cancer cells, but effects have been documented
   predominantly in isolated cells or in vitro cell culture systems. To
   directly link relative stiffness of tumors to cancer progression, we
   combined a mouse model of metastatic breast cancer with ex vivo
   measurements of bulk moduli of freshly excised, intact tumors. We found
   a high, inverse correlation between bulk modulus of resected tumors and
   subsequent local recurrence and metastasis. More compliant tumors were
   associated with more frequent, larger local recurrences and more
   extensive metastases than mice with relatively stiff tumors. We found
   that collagen content of resected tumors correlated with bulk modulus
   values. These data establish that relative differences in tumor
   stiffness correspond with tumor progression and metastasis, supporting
   further testing and development of tumor compliance as a prognostic
   biomarker in breast cancer.}},

Title = {{Implementation of set-based design in multidisciplinary design

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Set-based design is a design approach where feasible regions for the
   design variables are determined from different disciplines, with the
   goal of locating and working with the areas of feasible overlap. During
   the process the constraints are adjusted in order to accommodate
   conflicting requirements between disciplines. The main objective of
   set-based design is to narrow the design space, while delaying the
   pursuit of a single point design as much as possible. This process
   avoids finalizing decisions early and allows for flexibility in dealing
   with requirement creep. This paper presents the development and
   application of a new multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO)
   algorithm inspired by the principles of set-based design. The new MDO
   algorithm was developed with the core concept of describing the design
   using sets to incorporate features of set-based design and achieve
   greater flexibility than with a single-point optimization. The MDO
   algorithm was applied to a ship design problem and the ship design
   application demonstrated the value of utilizing set-based design as a
   space-reducing technique before approaching the problem with a
   point-based optimization. Furthermore, incorporating flexibility in the
   constraints allowed the optimization to handle a problem with very
   strict constraints in a rational manner and minimize the necessary
   constraint violation.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a general kinetic model for hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL)

   successfully correlated experimental data for the hydrothermal
   liquefaction of Chlorella protothecoides, Scenedesmus sp., and
   Nannochloropsis sp. The model can faithfully account for the influence
   of time and temperature on the gravimetric yields of gas, solid,
   biocrude, and aqueous-phase products from isothermal HTL of a 15 wt\%
   slurry. Examination of the rate constants shows that lipids and proteins
   are the major contributors to the biocrude, while other algal cell
   constituents contribute very little to the biocrude. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A cellular adaptive structure concept based on fluidic flexible matrix
   composite is investigated for its potential of achieving
   multifunctionalities simultaneously. This structure consists of a string
   of fluidic-connected fluidic flexible matrix composite cells with
   different properties. When under dynamic loading, the structure exhibits
   distinct poles and zeros (spectral data). These spectral data can be
   assigned, by tailoring fluidic flexible matrix composite design, so that
   the structure can perform dynamic functions such as vibration absorption
   or actuation with enhanced authority. To fully explore the potential of
   the fluidic flexible matrix composite-based cellular structure, this
   article carries out two progressive tasks. The first task is to develop
   a dynamic model for the multicellular structure. This model incorporates
   the concept of constitutive parameters to describe the performance of
   individual fluidic flexible matrix composite cell. The second task is to
   develop a synthesis procedure to assign these constitutive parameters so
   that the structure can achieve the prescribed spectral data. This
   procedure combines genetic algorithm with discrete variables and Jacobi
   inverse eigenvalue problem. Case studies show that the proposed
   procedure is successful for synthesizing structures with three cells.
   The range of the achievable spectral data is found through a numerical
   survey, and for each set of achievable spectral data, multiple designs
   can be synthesized efficiently.}},

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{A skin-friction reducing marine paint has been developed by mixing fine
   powder of PolyEthyleneOxide (PEO) with Self-Polishing Copolymer (SPC)
   Anti-Fouling (AF) paint. PEO is well documented as an effective drag
   reducing additive that exhibits the Toms effect. Friction drag reduction
   has been implemented by injecting aqueous polymer solutions into the
   turbulent boundary layer of liquid flows. However, such polymer
   injection is usually achieved through penetrations in the solid flow
   boundary, which is a significant practical obstacle to marine
   application. Here, we explore the use of a PEO infused marine coating to
   deliver the polymer molecules to the near-wall flow. The erosion
   mechanism of SPC paint resin and the subsequent dissolution of PEO lead
   to the controlled release of PEO from the painted surface. The direct
   force-balance measurement in a high-speed circulating water channel
   demonstrated a maximum 33\% skin friction reduction relative to
   conventional AF paint. From local shear stress measurements the skin
   friction coefficient of the present paint was lower than that of a
   smooth, uncoated surface, thereby demonstrating the turbulence
   modification due to the polymer additive. From measurements in a tow
   tank, the skin frictional drag was found to decrease by approximately
   10\% compared with conventional AF paint. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background aims. Myocardial infarction results in the formation of scar
   tissue populated by myofibroblasts, a phenotype characterized by
   increased contractility and matrix deposition. Mesenchymal stromal cells
   (MSC) delivered to the myocardium can attenuate scar growth and restore
   cardiac function, though the mechanism is unclear. Methods. This study
   describes a simple yet robust three-dimensional (3D) in vitro co-culture
   model to examine the paracrine effects of implanted MSC on resident
   myofibroblasts in a controlled biochemical and mechanical environment.
   The fibrosis model consisted of fibroblasts embedded in a 3D collagen
   gel cultured under defined oxygen tensions and exposed to either cyclic
   strain or interstitial fluid flow. MSC were injected into this model,
   and the effect on fibroblast phenotype was evaluated 48 h after cell
   injection. Results. Analysis of gene and protein expression of the
   fibroblasts indicated that injection of MSC attenuated the myofibroblast
   transition in response to reduced oxygen and mechanical stress.
   Assessment of vascular endothelial growth factor and insulin-like growth
   factor-1 levels demonstrated that their release by fibroblasts was
   markedly upregulated in hypoxic conditions but attenuated by strain or
   fluid flow. In fibroblast-MSC co-cultures, vascular endothelial growth
   factor levels were increased by hypoxia but not affected by mechanical
   stimuli, whereas insulin-like growth factor-1 levels were generally low
   an not affected by experimental conditions. Conclusions. This study
   demonstrates how a 3D in vitro model of the cardiac scar can be used to
   examine paracrine effects of MSC on the phenotype of resident
   fibroblasts and therefore illuminates the role of injected progenitor
   cells on the progression of cardiac fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{A bio-degradable scaffold incorporating osteoinductive factors is one of
   the alternative methods for achieving the regeneration of a mandibular
   bone defect. The current pilot study addressed such a bone
   reconstruction in a non-human primate model, Macaca fascicularis
   monkeys, with an engineered poly(E-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffold,
   provided with a carbonate-substituted hydroxyapatite coating. The
   scaffolds were implanted into unilaterally created mandibular segmental
   defects in 24 monkeys. Three experimental groups were formed: (1)
   scaffolds with rhBMP-2 (n = 8), (2) scaffolds with autologous mixed bone
   marrow cells (n = 8), and (3) empty scaffolds as a control group (n =
   8). Evaluation was based on clinical observation as well as micro-CT,
   mechanical, and histological analyses. Despite a high infection rate,
   the overall results showed that the currently designed PCL scaffolds had
   insufficient load-bearing capability, and complete bone union was not
   achieved after 6 months of implantation. Nevertheless, the group of PCL
   scaffolds loaded with rhBMP-2 showed evidence of bone-regenerative
   potential, in contrast to PCL with autologous mixed bone marrow cells
   and the control group. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   catalyst provided a 3.4-fold increase in yield of deoxygenated products
   when compared with the Raney Ni catalyst by decreasing the C-C bond

Abstract = {{Amyloid- peptide (A) oligomers may represent the proximal neurotoxin in
   Alzheimer's disease. Single-molecule microscopy (SMM) techniques have
   recently emerged as a method for overcoming the innate difficulties of
   working with amyloid-, including the peptide's low endogenous
   concentrations, the dynamic nature of its oligomeric states, and its
   heterogeneous and complex membrane interactions. SMM techniques have
   revealed that small oligomers of the peptide bind to model membranes and
   cells at low nanomolar-to-picomolar concentrations and diffuse at rates
   dependent on the membrane characteristics. These methods have also shown
   that oligomers grow or dissociate based on the presence of specific
   inhibitors or promoters and on the ratio of A40 to A42. Here, we discuss
   several types of single-molecule imaging that have been applied to the
   study of A oligomers and their membrane interactions. We also summarize
   some of the recent insights SMM has provided into oligomer behavior in
   solution, on planar lipid membranes, and on living cell membranes. A
   brief overview of the current limitations of the technique, including
   the lack of sensitive assays for A-induced toxicity, is included in
   hopes of inspiring future development in this area of research.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a generalized cycle counting criterion applicable for
   both uniaxial and arbitrary multi-axial loading conditions is presented.
   This criterion consists of two parts: (1) an effective fatigue damage
   parameter definition in either stress or strain space and (2) a fatigue
   cycle definition corresponding to maximum damage possibly attained by
   the fatigue damage parameter within a given loading history. After
   discussing its mathematical and mechanics basis, we first provide a
   rigorous proof that the proposed generalized cycle counting criterion
   yields exactly the same results as the rainflow counting method under
   uniaxial variable amplitude loading conditions. Then, its applications
   in multi-axial fatigue are demonstrated by presenting a series of
   closed-form solutions of both the fatigue damage parameter and number of
   cycles for a general harmonic loading history of three independent
   traction stress components on a crack plane. The validity of the new
   generalized cycle counting criterion is demonstrated by its ability to
   correlate available fatigue test data in the literature. These new
   developments also provide a more refined physical and mechanics basis
   for the recently proposed path length-based cycle counting method
   developed by the same authors for performing cycle counting of variable
   amplitude multi-axial loading histories.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a shear localisation model for studying friction
   stir welding (FSW) formation process. With this model, shear band (SB)
   width, SB formation time, and SB propagation speed can be theoretically

   theoretical estimate of the maximum welding speed possible for a given
   material and prescribed welding conditions, such as stir pin rotation
   speed and torque level. The model is shown to provide reasonable
   estimates of shear localisation parameters against a set of recent
   experimental data on FSW of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V. With this model,
   titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, high strength low-alloy steel 4340, and
   aluminium alloy 2024 are compared in terms of shear localisation
   parameters, such as maximum SB propagation speeds (or welding speeds).}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the properties of In0.51Ga0.49N/GaN
   disk-in-nanowire light emitting diodes (LEDs) epitaxially grown on
   silicon substrates by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The
   radiative efficiency of the nanowire ensemble, obtained from the
   temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements, under optimized
   growth conditions is 43\%, which increases to 55\% after parylene
   passivation. From high resolution transmission electron microscopy, it
   is evident that there is significant coalescence between nanowires when
   the areal density approaches 10(11) cm(-2). We have identified and
   characterized deep level electron and hole traps in the GaN nanowires
   and it is found that the trap densities increase with nanowire density,
   or with the degree of coalescence. It is therefore believed that the
   deep levels originate from dislocations and stacking faults arising from
   nanowire coalescence. The best output characteristics are measured in a
   LED having a nanowire density of 2 x 10(10) cm(-2), which exhibits a
   maximum internal quantum efficiency of similar to 55\% at an injection
   level of 10 A/cm(2). It is seen that the maximum efficiency would
   increase to 60\% in the absence of deep level traps.}},

Abstract = {{Ocular tissue properties have been widely studied in tension and
   compression for humans and a variety of animals. However, direct shear
   testing of the tissues of the sclera appear to be absent from the
   literature even though modeling, analyses, and anatomical studies have
   indicated that shear may play a role in the etiology of primary open
   angle glaucoma (POAG). In this work, the mechanical behavior of bovine
   scleral tissue in shear has been studied in both out-of-plane and
   in-plane modes of deformation. Stress-strain and relaxation tests were
   conducted on tissue specimens at controlled temperature and hydration
   focusing on trends related to specimen location and orientation. There
   was generally found to be no significant effect of specimen orientation
   and angular location in the globe on shear stiffness in both modes. The
   in-plane response, which is the primary load carrying mode, was found to
   be substantially stiffer than the out-of-plane mode. Also, within the
   in-plane studies, tissue further from the optic nerve was stiffer than
   the near tissue. The viscosity coefficient of the tissue varied
   insignificantly with distance from the optic nerve, but overall was much
   higher in-plane than out-of-plane.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is focused on simultaneous two-dimensional temperature and
   velocity field measurements to study heat transfer processes of ambient
   temperature nitrogen jets impinging on a heated wall. Instantaneous
   temperature fields were measured by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of
   toluene seeded as a tracer in the nitrogen carrier flow. High repetition
   rate particle image velocimetry (PIV) data were recorded simultaneously
   to investigate interactions between velocity and temperature fields.
   Different heat transfer phenomena were observed by parametric variation
   of Reynolds number, turbulence intensity and surface temperatures.
   Whereas laminar flows at low Reynolds numbers exhibited a smooth thermal
   boundary layer, highly dynamic flares were observed ejecting hot gas
   from the near wall region into the free stream at increased Reynolds
   numbers. Rotating vortex structures were identified as the leading
   source of flare generation. Additionally, turbulent heat flux was
   quantified and shown to significantly contribute to increased heat
   transfer rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a multiphase analytical model is developed for alkaline
   anion exchange membrane direct methanol fuel cell (AAEM-DMFC). The model
   prediction agrees with experimental data reasonably. Modeling results
   show that the methanol feed concentration, operating temperature and
   membrane thickness are the three factors that most significantly affect
   the cell performance. The effect of reactant flow rate is insignificant
   in high flow rate range, and this effect enhances when the flow rates
   are low. In low current density range, the cell shows better performance
   with lower methanol feed concentrations, while this trend reverses in
   high current density range. A similar trend is also found for the
   operating temperature. A thinner membrane leads to a higher methanol
   crossover; however, it yields better performance in mid and high current
   density range. Water is mass transfer limited once membrane thickness is
   high enough, resulting in the decrease of limiting current density. The
   carbon dioxide bubbles produced in anode are removed faster at higher
   operating temperatures. When the anode of the cell faces up, the best
   performance can be achieved. Inclining the cell leads to lower cell
   performance, and the performance degradation becomes more significant
   with larger inclining angles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nucleate pool boiling characteristics were investigated in a reduced

   pool boiling experiments were performed to analyze both the boiling heat

   transfer and CHF enhancement were shown to be related to the
   concentration. Special attention was focused on two phenomena: the
   enhanced CHF and improved boiling heat transfer in the RGO colloid.
   Possible mechanisms for these phenomena were examined from various
   viewpoints, including the RGO coating layer characteristics,
   wettability, water absorption by the RGO porous medium, and history of

Title = {{A structural strain method for low-cycle fatigue evaluation of welded
   components}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSELS AND PIPING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{39-51}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new structural strain method is presented to extend the
   early structural stress based master S-N curve method to low cycle
   fatigue regime in which plastic deformation can be significant while an
   elastic core is still present. The method is formulated by taking
   advantage of elastically calculated mesh-insensitive structural stresses
   based on nodal forces available from finite element solutions. The
   structural strain definition is consistent with classical plate and
   shell theory in which a linear through-thickness deformation field is
   assumed a priori in both elastic or elastic plastic regimes. With
   considerations of both yield and equilibrium conditions, the resulting
   structural strains are analytically solved if assuming elastic and
   perfectly plastic material behavior. The formulation can be readily
   extended to strain-hardening materials for which structural strains can
   be numerically calculated with ease. The method is shown effective in
   correlating low-cycle fatigue test data of various sources documented in
   the literature into a single narrow scatter band which is remarkable
   consistent with the scatter band of the existing master S-N curve
   adopted ASME B\&PV Code since 2007.
   With this new method, some of the inconsistencies of the pseudo-elastic
   structural stress procedure in 2007 ASME Div 2 Code can now be
   eliminated, such as its use of Neuber's rule in approximating structural
   strain beyond yield. More importantly, both low cycle and high cycle
   fatigue behaviors can now be treated in a unified manner. The earlier
   mesh-insensitive structural stress based master S-N curve method can now
   be viewed as an application of the structural strain method in high
   cycle regime, in which structural strains are linearly related to
   traction-based structural stresses according to Hooke's law. In
   low-cycle regime, the structural strain method characterizes fatigue
   damage directly in terms of structural strains that satisfy linear
   through-thickness deformation gradient assumption, material nonlinear
   behavior, and equilibrium conditions. The use of a pseudo-elastic
   structural stress definition is not fundamental, but merely a means to
   put low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue test data in a conventional
   stress-based S-N data representation which is typically preferred in
   engineering practice, than a strain-based representation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{When two rough bodies slide against each other, asperities on the
   opposing surfaces interact with each other, defining a transient contact
   and heat conduction problem. We represent each body by a Greenwood and
   Williamson asperity model with a Gaussian height distribution of
   identical spherical asperities. The heat transfer during a typical
   asperity interaction is analyzed, and the results are combined with the
   height distributions to determine the mean heat flux and the mean normal
   contact pressure as functions of the separation between reference planes
   in the two surfaces. We find that the effective thermal conductance is
   an approximately linear function of nominal contact pressure, but it
   also increases with the square root of the sliding speed and decreases
   with the 3/4 power of the combined RMS roughness. The results can be
   used to define an effective thermal contact resistance and division of
   frictional heat in macroscale (e.g., finite element) models of
   engineering components, requiring as input only the measured roughness

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{It is not unusual to observe that actual schedule and quality
   performances are different from planned performances (e.g., schedule
   delay and rework) during a construction project. Such differences often
   result in production pressure (e.g., being pressed to work faster).
   Previous studies demonstrated that such production pressure negatively
   affects safety performance. However, the process by which production
   pressure influences safety performance, and to what extent, has not been
   fully investigated. As a result, the impact of production pressure has
   not been incorporated much into safety management in practice. In an
   effort to address this issue, this paper examines how production
   pressure relates to safety performance over time by identifying their
   feedback processes. A conceptual causal loop diagram is created to
   identify the relationship between schedule and quality performances
   (e.g., schedule delays and rework) and the components related to a
   safety program (e.g., workers' perceptions of safety, safety training,
   safety supervision, and crew size). A case study is then experimentally
   undertaken to investigate this relationship with accident occurrence
   with the use of data collected from a construction site; the case study
   is used to build a System Dynamics (SD) model. The SD model, then, is
   validated through inequality statistics analysis. Sensitivity analysis
   and statistical screening techniques further permit an evaluation of the
   impact of the managerial components on accident occurrence. The results
   of the case study indicate that schedule delays and rework are the
   critical factors affecting accident occurrence for the monitored
   project. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical investigation based on fluid-structure interaction analysis
   was conducted to determine the influence of pulsatile turbulent flow and
   heating protocol on temperature distribution and heat flux variation in
   blood vessel and tumor tissues receiving hyperthermia treatment. The
   arterial wall was modeled using the volume-averaged porous media
   equations. In addition, a physiological waveform was employed for the
   inlet velocity and exit pressure. Furthermore, the present numerical
   model was validated by comparing it with previously published results in
   the literature. Moreover, discretization of the transport equations was
   achieved using a finite element scheme based on the Galerkin method of
   weighted residuals. The results were presented for both flexible and
   rigid wall models and three different heating schemes were considered in
   this investigation; constant temperature, constant wall flux and a
   step-wise heat flux. The first two heating schemes were found to exhibit
   large temperature variation along the top and bottom surfaces of the
   tumor, which could influence the surrounding healthy tissues. The
   results of this investigation illustrate that the local heat flux
   variation along the bottom surface of the tumor is greater at the
   beginning of the cycle, where the velocity magnitude is low as compared
   to the peak flow condition for different heating schemes. The results of
   this work may enhance the current understanding of the factors that
   determine the effect of hyperthermia treatment on tumor tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Combining several existing lumped-parameter models, this paper presents
   an electro-thermal model for cylindrical batteries. The model consists
   of two sub-models, an equivalent-circuit electrical model and a
   two-state thermal model which are coupled through heat generation and
   temperature dependence of the electrical parameters. The computationally
   efficient 5-state model captures the state of charge (SOC), terminal
   voltage, surface temperature and the often neglected core temperature of
   a battery for wide range of operating conditions. The proposed
   parameterization scheme allows separate identification of the electric
   and thermal sub-models, greatly reducing the complexity of the
   parameterization process. The methodology is applied to a
   LiFePO4/graphite battery. Comparison with the electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy data clarifies the frequency range of the model fidelity.
   The model is further validated with two drive-cycle tests, covering SOC
   range 25\%-100\%, temperature 5 degrees C-38 degrees C, and maximum
   C-rate of 22C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The multi-item newsvendor model with cross-selling and the solution when

Abstract = {{Products are often demanded in tandem because of the cross-selling
   effect. The demand for an item can increase if sales of its
   cross-selling-associated items are achieved or decrease when the
   associated items are out of stock, resulting in lost sales. Therefore, a
   joint inventory policy should be pursued in a cross-selling system. This
   paper introduces customer-driven cross-selling into centralized and
   competitive newsvendor (NV) models by representing an item's effective
   demand as a function of other items' order quantities. We derive
   first-order optimality conditions for the centralized model in addition
   to pure-strategy Nash equilibrium conditions and uniqueness conditions
   of the equilibria for the competitive model. We further develop
   gradient-based (GB) and iteration-based (IB) algorithms to solve the
   centralized and competitive models, respectively. A computational study
   verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The computational
   results show that a larger cross-selling effect leads to a larger order
   quantity in a centralized NV model but a smaller order quantity in a
   competitive NV model, and a larger positive correlation between items'
   demands leads to higher profits with smaller order quantities in both
   models. Moreover, NVs will order more items if the demand variance is
   greater, however resulting in lower profits. In a competitive situation,
   one will prefer smaller order quantities than in a centralized decision
   situation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study a tandem queueing system with K servers and no waiting space in
   between. A customer needs service from one server but can leave the
   system only if all down-stream servers are unoccupied. Such a system is
   often observed in toll collection during rush hours in transportation
   networks, and we call it a tollbooth tandem queue. We apply
   matrix-analytic methods to study this queueing system, and obtain
   explicit results for various performance measures. Using these results,
   we can efficiently compute the mean and variance of the queue lengths,
   waiting time, sojourn time, and departure delays. Numerical examples are
   presented to gain insights into the performance and design of the
   tollbooth tandem queue. In particular, it reveals that the intuitive
   result of arranging servers in decreasing order of service speed (i.e.,
   arrange faster servers at downstream stations) is not always optimal for
   minimizing the mean queue length or mean waiting time. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   phenomenological effective refractive index as has been used in the
   literature. This technique measures both the real and imaginary part of
   the optical conductivity, which is important for graphene
   optoelectronics and metamaterials. Using this method, we obtain
   broadband measurements of the complex optical conductivity for mono- and

   study how chemical doping with nitric acid modifies the complex optical
   conductivity. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{22-27}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of thermoset resins used in carbon fiber
   composites depend on their processing conditions. The inclusion of
   fibers into the resin locally affects the thermal balance, creates
   chemical inhomogeneities, and templates structural developments in the
   polymer near the fiber surface. In this study we use Raman and Brillouin
   light scattering to investigate the effect of carbon fibers on the
   mechanical properties of an epoxy matrix. Our results show that the
   longitudinal modulus of epoxy within a fiber tow is about 3.75\% lower
   than the modulus of the epoxy outside of the tow. Furthermore, within a
   fiber tow, the modulus depends on the local packing density of the
   carbon fibers. Comparison between our Brillouin and Raman measurements
   suggest that the observed spatial inhomogeneity in elastic properties of
   the matrix is not a result of residual stresses within the matrix but
   more likely due to structural reorganization in the interfacial region.

   Arrhenius relation with an activation energy of 220 meV that corresponds
   to the energy barrier observed by holes in the quantum dots. The
   transition temperature is in the range of 160-225 K for the temperature
   range studied, significantly higher than observed in previous type-I

Abstract = {{Commercial generation-five poly(amidoamine) dendrimer material (G5c) was
   fractionated into its major structural components. Monomeric GS (G5m;
   21-30 kDa) was isolated to compare its functional properties to the G5c
   material. Diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was
   employed to measure the self-diffusion coefficients and corresponding
   hydrodynamic radii of G5m and other G5c components as a function of
   dendrimer size (i.e., molecular weight) and tertiary structure (i.e.,
   generational or oligomeric nature). It was found that the hydrodynamic
   radius (R-H) scales with approximate numbers of atoms in the trailing
   generations, G5m, and oligomeric material at a rate of R-H proportional
   to N-0.35, in good agreement with previous reports of R-H scaling for
   PAMAM dendrimer with generation. G5c materials can be thought of as a
   heterogeneous mixture of dendrimers ranging in size from trailing
   generation two to tetramers of GS, approximately the same in size as a
   G7 dendrimer, with G5m comprising similar to 65\% of the material. The
   radius of hydration for G5m was measured to be 3.1 +/- 0.1 nm at pH 7.4.
   The 10\% swelling in response to a drop in pH observed for the G5c
   material was not observed for isolated G5m; however, the isolated G5-G5
   dimers had an increase of 4496 in R-H, indicating that the G5c pH
   response results from the increase in RI, of the oligomeric fraction
   upon protonation. Finally, the data allow for an experimental test of
   the ``slip{''} and ``stick{''} boundary models of the Stokes-Einstein
   equation for PAMAM dendrimer in water.}},

Abstract = {{The catalytic reduction of NO with hydrogen (H-2-SCR) in excess oxygen
   over a non-noble metal catalyst, Zn-ZSM-5, was studied for the first
   time. The results showed that Zn-ZSM-5 had considerable activity for
   H-2-SCR, with a single NO conversion peak at 250 degrees C, and high N-2
   product selectivity. Two noble metal based catalysts, Pd/Zn-ZSM-5 and
   Pd/Ru/W/(ZrO2-SiO2)SO4, were also synthesized and their H-2-SCR
   activities were evaluated and compared with Zn-ZSM-5 under identical
   laboratory experimental conditions. The effects of CO concentration,
   water vapor and SO2 added to the feed gas (NO, H-2, balance He) on
   H-2-SCR over these three catalysts were also studied and compared.
   hydrogen temperature programmed desorption (H-2-TPD) experiments were
   performed on Zn-ZSM-5: the results showed strong chemisorption of
   hydrogen, while both the amount and the binding strength of the
   chemisorbed hydrogen increased with the hydrogen dosing temperature. The
   role of Zn cations in the chemisorption is also discussed. (C) 2014

Title = {{Monolithically integrated Helmholtz coils by 3-dimensional printing}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{25}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{3D printing technology is of great interest for the monolithic
   fabrication of integrated systems; however, it is a challenge to
   introduce metallic components into 3D printed molds to enable broader
   device functionality. Here, we develop a technique for constructing a
   multi-axial Helmholtz coil by injecting a eutectic liquid metal Gallium
   Indium alloy (EGaIn) into helically shaped orthogonal cavities
   constructed in a 3D printed block. The tri-axial solenoids each carry up
   to 3.6A of electrical current and produce magnetic field up to 70 G.
   Within the central section of the coil, the field variation is less than
   1\% and is in agreement with theory. The flow rates and critical
   pressures required to fill the 3D cavities with liquid metal also agree
   with theoretical predictions and provide scaling trends for filling the
   3D printed parts. These monolithically integrated solenoids may find
   future applications in electronic cell culture platforms, atomic traps,
   and miniaturized chemical analysis systems based on nuclear magnetic
   resonance. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient method to predict vibration amplitudes at the resonant
   frequencies of dynamical systems with piecewise-linear nonlinearity is
   developed. This technique is referred to as bilinear amplitude
   approximation (BAA). BAA constructs a single vibration cycle at each
   resonant frequency to approximate the periodic steady-state response of
   the system. It is postulated that the steady-state response is
   piece-wise linear and can be approximated by analyzing the response over
   two time intervals during which the system behaves linearly. Overall the
   dynamics is nonlinear, but the system is in a distinct linear state
   during each of the two time intervals. Thus, the approximated vibration
   cycle is constructed using linear analyses. The equation of motion for
   analyzing the vibration of each state is projected along the overlapping
   space spanned by the linear mode shapes active in each of the states.
   This overlapping space is where the vibratory energy is transferred from
   one state to the other when the system switches from one state to the
   other. The overlapping space can be obtained using singular value
   decomposition. The space where the energy is transferred is used
   together with transition conditions of displacement and velocity
   compatibility to construct a single vibration cycle and to compute the
   amplitude of the dynamics. Since the BAA method does not require
   numerical integration of nonlinear models, computational costs are very
   low. In this paper, the BAA method is first applied to a
   single-degree-of-freedom system. Then, a three-degree-of-freedom system
   is introduced to demonstrate a more general application of BAA. Finally,
   the BAA method is applied to a full bladed disk with a crack. Results
   comparing numerical solutions from full-order nonlinear analysis and
   results obtained using BAA are presented for all systems. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Signaling proteins comprised of modular domains have evolved along with
   multicellularity as a method to facilitate increasing intracellular
   bandwidth. The effects of intramolecular interactions between modular
   domains within the context of native proteins have been largely
   unexplored. Here we examine intra-and intermolecular interactions in the
   multidomain signaling protein, protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha). We
   identify three interactions between two activated PKC molecules that
   synergistically stabilize a nanomolar affinity homodimer. Disruption of
   the homodimer results in a loss of PKC-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
   whereas disruption of the auto-inhibited state promotes the homodimer
   and prolongs PKC membrane localization. These observations support a
   novel regulatory mechanism wherein homodimerization dictates the
   equilibrium between the auto-inhibited and active states of PKC by
   sequestering auto-inhibitory interactions. Our findings underscore the
   physiological importance of context-dependent modular domain
   interactions in cell signaling.}},

   study}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Proteinuria and hematuria are both important health issues;
   however, the nature of the association between these findings and acute
   kidney injury (AKI) or mortality remains unresolved in critically ill
   patients.
   Methods: Proteinuria and hematuria were measured by a dipstick test and
   scored using a scale ranging from a negative result to 3+ in 1883
   patients admitted to the intensive care unit. AKI was defined according
   to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. The
   odds ratios (ORs) for AKI and 3-year mortality were calculated after
   adjustment for multiple covariates according to the degree of
   proteinuria or hematuria. For evaluating the synergistic effect on
   mortality among proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI, the relative excess
   risk due to interaction (RERI) was used.
   Results: Proteinuria and hematuria increased the ORs for AKI: the ORs of
   proteinuria were 1.66 (+/-), 1.86 (1+), 2.18 (2+), and 4.74 (3+)
   compared with non-proteinuria; the ORs of hematuria were 1.31 (+/-),
   1.58 (1+), 2.63 (2+), and 2.52 (3+) compared with non- hematuria. The
   correlations between the mortality risk and proteinuria or hematuria
   were all significant and graded (Ptrend < 0.001). There was a relative
   excess risk of mortality when both AKI and proteinuria or hematuria were
   considered together: the synergy indexes were 1.30 and 1.23 for
   proteinuria and hematuria, respectively.
   Conclusions: Proteinuria and hematuria are associated with the risks of
   AKI and mortality in critically ill patients. Additionally, these
   findings had a synergistic effect with AKI on mortality.}},

   generated tubulin subunits that were either enriched in or lacking
   acetylation of a-tubulin lysine 40 (K40) or detyrosination of the
   alpha-tubulin C-terminal tail. We show that K40 acetylation does not
   result in significant changes in kinesin-1's landing rate or motility
   parameters (velocity and run length) across experimental conditions. In
   contrast, detyrosination causes a moderate increase in kinesin-1 `s
   landing rate. The fact that the effects of detyrosination are dampened
   by prior K40 acetylation indicates that the combination of PTMs may be
   an important aspect of the functional output of microtubule
   heterogeneity. Importantly, our results indicate that the moderate
   influences that single PTMs have on kinesin-1 in vitro do not explain
   the strong correlation between specific PTMs and kinesin-1 transport in
   cells. Thus, additional mechanisms for regulating kinesin-1 transport in
   cells must be explored in future work.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of Desulfovibrio vulgaris to reduce U(VI) was studied
   previously with nongrowth conditions involving a high biomass
   concentration; thus, bacterial growth through respiration of U(VI) was
   not proven. In this study, we conducted a series of batch tests on U(VI)
   reduction by D. vulgaris at a low initial biomass (10 to 20 mg/L of
   protein) that could reveal biomass growth. D. vulgaris grew with U(VI)
   respiration alone, as well as with simultaneous sulfate reduction.
   Patterns of growth kinetics and solids production were affected by
   sulfate and Fe2+. Biogenic sulfide nonenzymatically reduced 76\% of the
   U(VI) and greatly enhanced the overall reduction rate in the absence of
   Fe2+ but was rapidly scavenged by Fe2+ to form FeS in the presence of
   Fe2+. Biogenic U solids were uraninite (UO2) nanocrystallites associated
   with 20 mg/g biomass as protein. The crystallite thickness of UO2 was 4
   to 5 nm without Fe2+ but was <1.4 nm in the presence of Fe2+, indicating
   poor crystallization inhibited by adsorbed Fe2+ and other amorphous Fe
   solids, such as FeS or FeCO3. This work fills critical gaps in
   understanding the metabolic utilization of U by microorganisms and
   formation of UO2 solids in bioremediation sites.}},

Title = {{Genome-wide Analysis Reveals Novel and Discrete Functions for Tubulin
   Carboxy-Terminal Tails}},
Journal = {{CURRENT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1295-1303}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Microtubules (MTs) support diverse transport and force
   generation processes in cells. Both alpha- and beta-tubulin proteins
   possess carboxy-terminal tail regions (CTTs) that are negatively
   charged, intrinsically disordered, and project from the MT surface where
   they interact with motors and other proteins. Although CTTs are presumed
   to play important roles in MT networks, these roles have not been
   determined in vivo.
   Results: We examined the function of CTTs in vivo by using a systematic
   collection of mutants in budding yeast. We find that CTTs are not
   essential; however, loss of either alpha- or beta-CTT sensitizes cells
   to MT-destabilizing drugs. beta-CTT, but not alpha-CTT, regulates MT
   dynamics by increasing frequencies of catastrophe and rescue events. In
   addition, beta-CTT is critical for the assembly of the mitotic spindle
   and its elongation during anaphase. We use genome-wide genetic
   interaction screens to identify roles for alpha- and beta-CTTs,
   including a specific role for beta-CTT in supporting kinesin-5/Cin8. Our
   genetic screens also identified novel interactions with pathways not
   related to canonical MT functions.
   Conclusions: We conclude that alpha- and beta-CTTs play important and
   largely discrete roles in MT networks. beta-CTTs promotes MT dynamics.
   beta-CTT also regulates force generation in the mitotic spindle by
   supporting kinesin-5/Cin8 and dampening dynein. Our genetic screens
   identify links between alpha- and beta-CTT and additional cellular
   pathways and suggest novel functions.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the enhancement of
   hydrogen production from alcohol wastewater by adding fermentation
   residue using an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) under
   thermophillic operation (55 degrees C) and at a constant pH of 5.5. The
   digestibility of the added fermentation residue was also evaluated. For
   a first set of previous experiments, the ASBR system was operated to
   obtain an optimum COD loading rate of 50.6 kg/m(3) d of alcohol
   wastewater without added fermentation residue and the produced gas
   contained 31\% H-2 and 69\% CO2. In this experiment, the effect of added
   fermentation residue (100-1200 mg/l) on hydrogen production performance
   was investigated under a COD loading rate of 50.6 kg/m3 d of the alcohol
   wastewater. At a fermentation residue concentration of 1000 mg/l, the
   produced gas contained 40\% H-2 and 60\% CO2 without methane and the
   system gave the highest hydrogen yield and specific hydrogen production
   rate of 128 ml/g COD removed and 2880 ml/l d, respectively. Under
   thermophilic operation with a high total COD loading rate (51.8 kg/m3 d)
   and a short HRT (21 h) at pH 5.5, the ASBR system could only break down
   cellulose (41.6\%) and hemicellulose (21.8\%), not decompose lignin.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Volume = {{256}},
Pages = {{440-448}},

Abstract = {{Porous hollow nanospheres (or spherical shells) made of NiO nanosheets
   are synthesized and tested for the electrochemical performance of the
   electrodes made of these materials for supercapacitors. Preparation of
   the NiO sheet hollow spheres starts with synthesis of polystyrene
   nanospheres with carboxyl groups (CPS), followed by a two-step
   activation procedure and the subsequent nucleation and growth by
   electroless deposition of Ni on the CPS core to obtain CPS@Ni core-shell
   nanoparticles. The CPS core is eliminated and metallic Ni nanoshell is
   converted into NiO by calcinations at high temperatures. The material
   properties of as-prepared hollow NiO nanospheres are characterized by
   TEM, XRD and N-2-absorption measurements. The electrochemical
   characteristics of the electrodes made of these nanostructured NiO
   materials are determined by the CV and galvanostatic measurements. These
   electrochemical tests indicate that electrodes made of the NiO nanosheet
   hollow spheres exhibit an improved reversible capacitance of 600 F g(-1)
   after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g(-1). It is
   believed that the good electrochemical performance of these electrodes
   is attributed to the improved OH- transport in the porous network
   structures associated with the hollow spheres of randomly oriented NiO
   nanosheets. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Negotiated control between the manual and visual systems for visually
   guided hand reaching movements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Control of reaching movements for manual work, vehicle
   operation, or interactions with manual interfaces requires concurrent
   gaze control for visual guidance of the hand. We hypothesize that
   reaching movements are based on negotiated strategies to resolve
   possible conflicting demands placed on body segments shared by the
   visual (gaze) and manual (hand) control systems. Further, we hypothesize
   that a multiplicity of possible spatial configurations (redundancy) in a
   movement system enables a resolution of conflicting demands that does
   not require sacrificing the goals of the two systems.
   Methods: The simultaneous control of manual reach and gaze during seated
   reaching movements was simulated by solving an inverse kinematics model
   wherein joint trajectories were estimated from a set of recorded hand
   and head movements. A secondary objective function, termed negotiation
   function, was introduced to describe a means for the manual reach and
   gaze directing systems to balance independent goals against (possibly
   competing) demands for shared resources, namely the torso movement. For
   both systems, the trade-off may be resolved without sacrificing goal
   achievement by taking advantage of redundant degrees of freedom.
   Estimated joint trajectories were then compared to joint movement
   recordings from ten participants. Joint angles were predicted with and
   without the negotiation function in place, and model accuracy was
   determined using the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) and differences
   between estimated and recorded joint angles.
   Results: The prediction accuracy was generally improved when negotiation
   was included: the negotiated control reduced RMSE by 16\% and 30\% on
   average when compared to the systems with only manual or visual control,
   respectively. Furthermore, the RMSE in the negotiated control system
   tended to improve with torso movement amplitude.
   Conclusions: The proposed model describes how multiple systems cooperate
   to perform goal-directed human movements when those movements draw upon
   shared resources. Allocation of shared resources can be undertaken by a
   negotiation process that is aware of redundancies and the existence of
   multiple solutions within the individual systems.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of wounds by atmospheric pressure plasmas in the context
   of plasma medicine typically proceeds through a liquid layer covering
   exposed cells. The wounds and their liquid covering often have irregular
   shapes with electrical properties (i.e. conductivity and permittivities)
   that may differ not only from wound-to-wound but also for a single wound
   as healing proceeds. The differing shapes and electrical properties
   extend into the liquid within the wound that typically contains cellular
   materials such as blood platelets. The plasma, wound, liquid and
   intra-liquid cellular components represent an interacting system of
   mutual dependence. In this paper, we discuss the results from a
   computational investigation of the treatment of small, liquid-covered
   wounds by filamentary dielectric barrier discharges. The sizes of the
   wounds are of the order of the plasma filaments and the liquid within
   the wound, an approximation of blood serum, contains idealized blood
   platelets. We find that the electrical properties of a wound can have
   significant effects on the spreading of the plasma on its surface by
   virtue of the deformation of the vacuum electric fields due to the
   shape, the effective capacitance of the wound and the discontinuities in
   electrical permittivity. This in turn effects the penetration of the
   electric field to cells under the liquid. The orientation and
   permittivity of the platelets relative to the liquid determines the
   electric fields that may stimulate the platelets.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid scintillator detector assemblies contain an inert nitrogen
   expansion volume to allow for expansion of the liquid with changing
   temperature. Measurements and Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations are
   performed to study the dependence of pulse height distribution shapes as
   a function of detector angle for two liquid scintillators assemblies
   filled with 97\% organic-liquid cocktail and a 3\% expansion volume. A
   12.7-cm diameter by 12.7-cm long and a 7.6-cm diameter by 9.1-cm long
   EJ-309 liquid scintillator assemblies are investigated using a Cs-137
   gamma-ray source. Aside from the differences in dimensions, the detector
   assemblies also differed in the design of the active detector volume:
   there is no light guide in the 12.7-cm-diameter detector assembly,
   whereas the 7.6-cm-diameter detector contains a BK7 light guide between
   the scintillation liquid and optical coupling to the photomultiplier
   tube. Results for the 12.7-cm-diameter detector show a decrease in the
   position of the Compton edge ranges from 4\% to 40\%, at detector
   orientations where the expansion volume exists between scintillating
   medium and the photomultiplier tube. Results for the 7.6-cm-diameter
   detector show that the position of the Compton edge is relatively
   unaffected at all detector orientations due to the presence of light
   guide. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   photocurrent generation. As compared to indium-tin-oxide/MoS2/metal
   structures, the presented graphene/MoS2/metal heterostructures exhibit
   greatly enhanced quantum efficiencies in the blue-near ultraviolet

Abstract = {{This study investigates the in vivo therapeutic capabilities of
   transcostal histotripsy without using aberration correction mechanisms
   and its thermal impact on overlying tissues. Non-invasive liver
   treatments were conducted in eight pigs, with four lesions generated
   through transcostal windows with full ribcage obstruction and four
   lesions created through transabdominal windows without rib coverage.
   Treatments were performed by a 750 kHz focused transducer using 5 cycle
   pulses at 200 Hz PRF, with estimated in situ peak negative pressures of
   13-17 MPa. Temperatures on overlying tissues including the ribs were
   measured with needle thermocouples inserted superficially beneath the
   skin. Treatments of approximately 40 min were applied, allowing
   overlying tissue temperatures to reach saturation. Lesions yielded
   statistically comparable ablation volumes of 3.6 +/- 1.7 cm(3) and 4.5
   +/- 2.0 cm(3) in transcostal and transabdominal treatments,
   respectively. The average temperature increase observed in transcostal
   treatments was 3.9 +/- 2.1 degrees C, while transabdominal treatments
   showed an increase of 1.7 +/- 1.3 degrees C. No damage was seen on the
   ribcage or other overlying tissues. These results indicate that
   histotripsy can achieve effective treatment through the ribcage in vivo

Title = {{CXCR7 Controls Competition for Recruitment of beta-Arrestin 2 in Cells

Abstract = {{Chemokine CXCL12 promotes growth and metastasis of more than 20
   different human cancers, as well as pathogenesis of other common
   diseases. CXCL12 binds two different receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7, both of
   which recruit and signal through the cytosolic adapter protein
   beta-arrestin 2. Differences in CXCL12-dependent recruitment of
   beta-arrestin 2 in cells expressing one or both receptors remain poorly
   defined. To quantitatively investigate parameters controlling
   association of beta-arrestin 2 with CXCR4 or CXCR7 in cells
   co-expressing both receptors, we used a systems biology approach
   combining real-time, multi-spectral luciferase complementation imaging
   with computational modeling. Cells expressing only CXCR4 maintain low
   basal association with beta-arrestin 2, and CXCL12 induces a rapid,
   transient increase in this interaction. In contrast, cells expressing
   only CXCR7 have higher basal association with beta-arrestin 2 and
   exhibit more gradual, prolonged recruitment of beta-arrestin 2 in
   response to CXCL12. We developed and fit a data-driven computational
   model for association of either CXCR4 or CXCR7 with beta-arrestin 2 in
   cells expressing only one type of receptor. We then experimentally
   validated model predictions that co-expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 on the
   same cell substantially decreases both the magnitude and duration of
   CXCL12-regulated recruitment of beta-arrestin 2 to CXCR4. Co-expression
   of both receptors on the same cell only minimally alters recruitment of
   beta-arrestin 2 to CXCR7. In silico experiments also identified
   beta-arrestin 2 as a limiting factor in cells expressing both receptors,
   establishing that CXCR7 wins the ``competition'' with CXCR4 for CXCL12
   and recruitment of beta-arrestin 2. These results reveal how competition
   for beta-arrestin 2 controls integrated responses to CXCL12 in cells
   expressing both CXCR4 and CXCR7. These results advance understanding of
   normal and pathologic functions of CXCL12, which is critical for
   developing effective strategies to target these pathways
   therapeutically.}},

Abstract = {{Hospital emergency departments (EDs) typically use triage systems that
   classify and prioritize patients almost exclusively in terms of their
   need for timely care. Using a combination of analytic and simulation
   models, we demonstrate that adding an up-front estimate of patient
   complexity to conventional urgency-based classification can
   substantially improve both patient safety (by reducing the risk of
   adverse events) and operational efficiency (by shortening the average
   length of stay). Moreover, we find that EDs with high resource
   (physician and/or examination room) utilization, high heterogeneity in
   the treatment time between simple and complex patients, and a relatively
   equal number of simple and complex patients benefit most from
   complexity-augmented triage. Finally, we find that (1) although
   misclassification of a complex patient as simple is slightly more
   harmful than vice versa, complexity-augmented triage is relatively
   robust to misclassification error rates as high as 25\%; (2) streaming
   patients based on complexity information and prioritizing them based on
   urgency is better than doing the reverse; and (3) separating simple and
   complex patients via streaming facilitates the application of lean
   methods that can further amplify the benefit of complexity-augmented
   triage.}},

Abstract = {{Ventifacts, rocks abraded by wind-borne particles, are found in Gale
   Crater, Mars. In the eastward drive from ``Bradbury Landing{''} to
   ``Rocknest,{''} they account for about half of the float and outcrop
   seen by Curiosity's cameras. Many are faceted and exhibit abrasion
   textures found at a range of scales, from submillimeter lineations to
   centimeter-scale facets, scallops, flutes, and grooves. The drive path
   geometry in the first 100 sols of the mission emphasized the
   identification of abrasion facets and textures formed by westerly flow.
   This upwind direction is inconsistent with predictions based on models
   and the orientation of regional dunes, suggesting that these ventifact
   features formed from very rare high-speed winds. The absence of active
   sand and evidence for deflation in the area indicates that most of the
   ventifacts are fossil features experiencing little abrasion today.}},

Abstract = {{Universal relations hold in all members that belong to a certain class
   of bodies, and they are therefore useful in designing experiments in
   which all members belonging to the particular class of bodies can be
   tested. It has been shown recently that the class of elastic bodies is
   much larger than the classical Cauchy elastic bodies. It has also been
   shown that such elastic bodies have firm thermodynamic underpinnings. In
   this short paper, we discuss universal relations that hold for a large
   sub-class of bodies which belong to this new class of elastic bodies. To
   be more precise, we consider a class of compressible isotropic elastic
   solids that are a sub-class of the new class of elastic bodies. We show
   that practically all the universal solutions which are possible in
   classical Cauchy elastic bodies are also possible within the context of
   the sub-class of elastic bodies that we consider.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To estimate the limit of functional liver reserve for safe
   application of hepatic irradiation using changes in indocyanine green,
   an established assay of liver function.
   Materials and methods: From 2005 to 2011, 60 patients undergoing hepatic
   irradiation were enrolled in a prospective study assessing the plasma
   retention fraction of indocyanine green at 15-min (ICG-R15) prior to,
   during (at 60\% of planned dose), and after radiotherapy (RT). The limit
   of functional liver reserve was estimated from the damage fraction of
   functional liver (DFL) post-RT {[}1 -
   (ICG-R15-(pre-RT)/ICG-R15(post-RT))] where no toxicity was observed
   using a beta distribution function.
   Results: Of 48 evaluable patients, 3 (6\%) developed RILD, all within
   2.5 months of completing RT. The mean ICG-R15 for non-RILD patients
   pre-RT, during-RT and 1-month post-RT was 20.3\%(SE 2.6), 22.0\%(3.0),
   and 27.5\%(2.8), and for RILD patients was 6.3\%(4.3), 10.8\%(2.7), and
   47.6\%(8.8). RILD was observed at post-RT damage fractions of >= 78\%.
   Both DFL assessed by during-RT ICG and MLD predicted for DFL post-RT (p
   < 0.0001). Limiting the post-RT DFL to 50\%, predicted a 99\%
   probability of a true complication rate <15\%.
   Conclusion: The DFL as assessed by changes in ICG during treatment
   serves as an early indicator of a patient's tolerance to hepatic
   irradiation. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{It has long been known that electron emission from a surface
   significantly affects the sheath surrounding that surface. Typical fluid
   theory of a planar sheath with emitted electrons assumes that the plasma
   electrons follow the Boltzmann relation and the emitted electrons are
   emitted with zero energy and predicts a potential drop of 1.03T(e)/e
   across the sheath in the floating condition. By considering the modified
   velocity distribution function caused by plasma electrons lost to the
   wall and the half-Maxwellian distribution of the emitted electrons, it
   is shown that ratio of plasma electron temperature to emitted electron
   temperature significantly affects the sheath potential when the plasma
   electron temperature is within an order of magnitude of the emitted
   electron temperature. When the plasma electron temperature equals the
   emitted electron temperature the emissive sheath potential goes to zero.
   One dimensional particle-in-cell simulations corroborate the predictions
   made by this theory. The effects of the addition of a monoenergetic
   electron beam to the Maxwellian plasma electrons were explored, showing
   that the emissive sheath potential is close to the beam energy only when
   the emitted electron flux is less than the beam flux. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Diesel/natural gas dual-fuel engines were studied numerically using
   Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and multi-objective Pareto optimization.
   The combustion characteristics were analyzed and performance metrics
   studied as a function of the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) fraction,
   compression ratio, injection timing, and natural gas fraction (NGF). The
   fundamental effects of the NGF on the in-cylinder pressure, peak
   temperature, brake torque, and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC)
   were investigated. Regression coefficients were obtained using LHS to
   describe the sensitivity of the brake torque, BSFC, and brake specific
   NOX (BSNOX) emission levels to the operating parameters. A response
   surface was found using Pareto optimization. The dominant parameters
   affecting the brake torque, BSFC, and BSNOX were the compression ratio
   and EGR fraction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Electrochemical dynamics of nanoscale metallic inclusions in dielectrics}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Nanoscale metal inclusions in or on solid-state dielectrics are an
   integral part of modern electrocatalysis, optoelectronics, capacitors,
   metamaterials and memory devices. The properties of these composite
   systems strongly depend on the size, dispersion of the inclusions and
   their chemical stability, and are usually considered constant. Here we
   demonstrate that nanoscale inclusions (for example, clusters) in
   dielectrics dynamically change their shape, size and position upon
   applied electric field. Through systematic in situ transmission electron
   microscopy studies, we show that fundamental electrochemical processes
   can lead to universally observed nucleation and growth of metal
   clusters, even for inert metals like platinum. The clusters exhibit
   diverse dynamic behaviours governed by kinetic factors including ion
   mobility and redox rates, leading to different filament growth modes and
   structures in memristive devices. These findings reveal the microscopic
   origin behind resistive switching, and also provide general guidance for
   the design of novel devices involving electronics and ionics.}},

Title = {{Evaluating Binding Avidities of Populations of Heterogeneous Multivalent
   Ligand-Functionalized Nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{5600-5609}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Ligand-functionalized, multivalent nanoparticles have been extensively
   studied as targeted carriers in biomedical applications for drug
   delivery and imaging. The chemical synthesis method used, however,
   generates nanoparticles that are heterogeneous with respect to the
   number of ligands on each nanoparticle. This article examines the role
   this heterogeneity in ligand number plays in multivalent interactions
   between nanoparticle ligands and targeted receptors. We designed and
   synthesized a model heterogeneous multivalent nanoparticle system and
   developed a unique kinetic analysis to quantify the avidity
   interactions. This system used mono-dispersed poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM)
   dendrimers that were then chemically functionalized with ssDNA
   oligonucleotides as to yield the heterogeneous nanoparticle platform
   (ligand valencies n = 1.7, 3.1, 6), and employed complementary
   oligonucleotides as targeted receptors on a surface plasmon resonance
   (SPR) biosensor to evaluate the multivalent binding of the nanoparticle
   population. Kinetic analysis of both parallel initial rate and
   dual-Langmuir analyses of SPR binding curves was performed to assess
   avidity distributions. We found that batches of multivalent
   nanoparticles contain both fast- and slow-dissociation subpopulations,
   which can be characterized as having ``weak{''} and ``strong{''} surface
   interactions ({''}binding{''}), respectively. Furthermore, we found that
   the proportion of ``strong{''} binders increased as a function of the
   mean oligonucleotide valence of the nanoparticle population. These
   analyses allowed an assessment of how avidity distributions are
   modulated by the number of functionalized ligands and suggested that
   there are threshold valences that differentiated fast- and
   slow-dissociation nanoparticles.}},

   Microstructure Growth}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{5799-5812}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Control of the uniformity of vertically aligned carbon nanotube
   structures (CNT ``forests{''}), in terms of both geometry and nanoscale
   morphology (density, diameter, and alignment), is crucial for
   applications. Many studies report complex and sometimes unexplained
   spatial variations of the height of macroscopic CNT forests, as well as
   variations among micropillars grown from lithographically patterned
   catalyst arrays. We present a model for chemically coupled CNT growth,
   which describes the origins of synergetic growth effects among CNT
   micropillars in proximity. Via this model, we propose that growth of
   CNTs is locally enhanced by active species that are catalytically
   produced at the substrate-bound nanoparticles. The local concentration
   of these active species modulates the growth rate of CNTs, in a
   spatially dependent manner driven by diffusion and local
   generation/consumption at the catalyst sites. Through experiments and
   numerical simulations, we study how the uniformity of CNT micropillars
   can be influenced by their size and spacing within arrays and predict
   the widely observed abrupt transition between tangled and vertical CNT
   growth by assigning a threshold concentration of active species. This
   mathematical framework enables predictive modeling of spatially
   dependent CNT growth, as well as design of catalyst patterns to achieve
   engineered uniformity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have designed and characterized the beam steering
   structure for terahertz radiation based on doubly corrugated spoofed
   surface plasmon polariton (DC-SSPP) architecture and analyzed the design
   of a high-speed terahertz analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Two DC-SSPP
   waveguides comprising metal-covered GaAs are utilized to build an
   interferometric structure with localized doping in the groove region.
   Active modulation of free carrier density in the doped n-GaAs will cause
   relative phase differences between terahertz beams in separate arms of
   the interferometer, giving rise to deflected radiation in the far field.
   In this paper, both mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations
   are used to verify and optimize the design. Two different architectures
   operating on the enhancement mode and depletion mode are studied
   separately in detail. Applying the beam bender in the ADC design poses
   challenges such as structural symmetry and multibit resolution. With a
   full differential implementation of the input signal and combination of
   nonlinear detector arrays with carefully designed gain and saturation
   power, a 3-bit ADC is demonstrated with higher than 60 GS/s speed and

Abstract = {{In this research we study the dynamics of a coupled linear
   oscillator-bistable energy harvester system. The method of harmonic
   balance and perturbation analysis are used to predict the existence and
   stability of the bistable device interwell vibration. The influences of
   important parameters on tailoring the coupled system response are
   investigated to determine strategies for improved energy harvesting
   performance. We demonstrate analytically that for excitation frequencies
   in a bandwidth less than the natural frequency of the uncoupled linear
   oscillator having net mass that is the combination of the bistable and
   linear bodies, the bistable harvester dynamics may be substantially
   intensified as compared to a single (individual) bistable harvester. In
   addition, the linear-bistable coupled system may introduce a stable
   out-of-phase dynamic around the natural frequency of the uncoupled
   linear oscillator, enhancing the performance of the harvester by
   providing a second interwell response not possible when using a single
   bistable harvester. Key analytical findings are confirmed through
   numerical simulations and experiments, validating the predicted trends

Abstract = {{Introduction: Esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC) are aggressive cancers
   that are increasing in incidence and associated with a poor prognosis.
   The identification of highly expressed genes in EAC relative to
   metaplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE) may provide new targets for novel
   early cancer detection strategies using endoscopically administered,
   fluorescently labeled peptides.
   Methods: Gene expression analysis of BE and EACs were used to identify
   the cell surface marker transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) as over-expressed in
   cancer. The expression of two major isoforms of TGM2 was determined by
   qRT-polymerase chain reaction in an independent cohort of 128 EACs.
   Protein expression was confirmed by tissue microarrays and immunoblot
   analysis of EAC cell lines. TGM2 DNA copy number was assessed using
   single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and confirmed by qPCR. TGM2
   expression in neoadjuvantly treated EACs and following small interfering
   RNA-mediated knockdown in cisplatin-treated EAC cells was used to
   determine its possible role in chemoresistance.
   Results: TGM2 is overexpressed in 15 EACs relative to 26 BE samples.
   Overexpression of both TGM2 isoforms was confirmed in 128 EACs and
   associated with higher tumor stage, poor differentiation, and increased
   inflammatory and desmoplastic response. Tissue microarrays and
   immunohistochemistry confirmed elevated TGM2 protein expression in EAC.
   Single nucleotide polymorphism and qPCR analysis revealed increased TGM2
   gene copy number as one mechanism underlying elevated TGM2 expression.
   TGM2 was highly expressed in resistant EAC after patient treatment with
   neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation suggesting a role for TGM2 in
   chemoresistance.
   Conclusion: TGM2 may be a useful cell surface biomarker for early
   detection of EAC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{One approach to vibration control is to apply a force to a primary
   structure that opposes the excitation, effectively canceling the
   external disturbance. A familiar passive example of this approach is the
   linear-tuned mass absorber. In this spirit, the utility of a bistable
   attachment for attenuating vibrations, especially in terms of the
   high-orbit, snap-through dynamic, is investigated using the harmonic
   balance method and experiments. Analyses demonstrate the fundamental
   harmonic snap-through dynamic, having commensurate frequency with the
   single-frequency harmonic excitation, may generate adverse constructive
   forces that substantially reinforce the applied excitation, primarily at
   lower frequencies. However, both analyses and experiments indicate that
   such high-orbit dynamics may be largely destabilized by increased
   bistable attachment damping. Destructive forces, which substantially
   oppose the excitation, are unique in that they lead to a form of
   vibration attenuation analogous to strictly adding damping to the host
   structure, leaving its spectral characteristics largely unaltered. The
   experiments verify the analytical findings and also uncover nonlinear
   dynamics not predicted by the analysis, which render similar attenuation
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in

   GREET is comprised of two components: GREET 1 represents the fuel cycle
   of various energy carriers, including automotive fuels, and GREET 2
   represents the vehicle cycle, which accounts for the production of
   vehicles and their constituent materials. The GREET model was updated in
   2012 and now includes higher-resolution material processing and
   transformation data. This study evaluated how model updates influence
   material and vehicle life cycle results. First, new primary energy
   demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions results from GREET 2 for
   steel, aluminum, and plastics resins are compared herein with those from
   the previous version of the model as well as industrial results. A part
   of the comparison is a discussion about causes of differences between
   results. Included in this discussion is an assessment of the impact of
   the new material production data on vehicle life cycle results for
   conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by comparing the
   energy and GHG emission values in the updated and previous versions of

Abstract = {{When facing high levels of overstock inventories, firms often push their
   salesforce to work harder than usual to attract more demand, and one way
   to achieve that is to offer attractive incentives. However, most
   research on the optimal design of salesforce incentives ignores this
   dependency and assumes that operational decisions of
   production/inventory management are separable from design of salesforce
   incentives. We investigate this dependency in the problem of joint
   salesforce incentive design and inventory/production control. We develop
   a dynamic Principal-Agent model with both Moral Hazard and Adverse
   Selection in which the principal is strategic and risk-neutral but the
   agent is myopic and risk-averse. We find the optimal joint incentive
   design and inventory control strategy, and demonstrate the impact of
   operational decisions on the design of a compensation package. The
   optimal strategy is characterized by a menu of inventory-dependent
   salesforce compensation contracts. We show that the optimal compensation
   package depends highly on the operational decisions; when inventory
   levels are high, (a) the firm offers a more attractive contract and (b)
   the contract is effective in inducing the salesforce to work harder than
   usual. In contrast, when inventory levels are low, the firm can offer a
   less attractive compensation package, but still expect the salesforce to
   work hard enough. In addition, we show that although the
   inventory/production management and the design of salesforce
   compensation package are highly correlated, information acquisition
   through contract design allows the firm to implement traditional
   inventory control policies: a market-based state-dependent policy (with
   a constant base-stock level when the inventory is low) that makes use of
   the extracted market condition from the agent is optimal. This work
   appears to be the first article on operations that addresses the
   important interplay between inventory/production control and salesforce
   compensation decisions in a dynamic setting. Our findings shed light on
   the effective integration of these two significant aspects for the
   successful operation of a firm. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{The Bottom Up Approach is Not Always the Best Processing Method:
   Dense-Al2O3/NiAl2O4 Composites}},

Abstract = {{The bottom up approach suggests that atomic scale mixing should permit
   optimal control of processing for many types of materials in terms of
   densification rates, final and average grain sizes; and, thereafter,
   global properties thereby minimizing processing conditions, capital
   equipment requirements, and energy consumption. The literature indicates
   that, to date, this axiom has not been tested although numerous
   researchers have whole-heartedly adopted the concept. Liquid-feed flame
   spray pyrolysis (LF-FSP) provides atomically mixed NiO3Al2O3
   nanopowders(30-40 nm average particle size, APS) that are a single
   phase, spinel solid solution. Sintering 56 +/- 1 wt\% CIPped pellets to
   95 +/- 1\% theoretical density using two different heating schedules
   produces -Al2O3/NiAl2O4 composites with grain sizes of 0.9 +/- 0.2 mu m.
   For comparative purposes, ball milled Al2O3 are synthesized from both
   highly atomically-mixed single phase metastable spinel nanopowders and
   NiAl2O4 30-40 nm APS pellets of the same composition with a
   submicrometer length scale mixing and similar green densities are also
   sintered to 95 +/- 2\% TD. In both instances, the same microstructures
   are realized despite the great difference in length scale of mixing.
   This contrasts greatly with the expectation that the atomically mixed
   materials would give finer grain sizes at the same densities and with
   faster sintering times, suggesting that the bottom up approach is not
   always valid.}},

Abstract = {{A dual-channel subwavelength low-power radio repeater system is
   presented in this communication. The repeater system is composed of a
   low-profile miniaturized receive antenna, an end-fire two-element
   miniaturized transmit antenna array, and a low-power high-gain amplifier
   chain. The isolation between the receive antenna and transmit antenna is
   achieved by a near-field cancellation method. To achieve a dual-channel
   response antennas are made wideband using parasitic elements and the
   open-loop transfer function is designed in a manner to present
   zero-crossing phase at two frequency points within the band. The
   closed-loop gain of the repeater system has a gain higher than that of
   the amplifier at the zero-crossing phase frequency points, which gives
   rise to repeater performance at two distinct channels. A prototype of
   the repeater system operating in 2.4 similar to 2.5 GHz with dimensions
   of 39.67 mm x 85.39 mm x 3.18 mm is designed and fabricated. Performance
   of this repeater is characterized experimentally by measuring its radar
   cross section (RCS). Using an amplifier chain with gain of 45 dB, it is
   shown that dual-channel repeater exhibits RCS values of 27.7 dBsm and
   26.0 dBsm at 2.42 GHz and 2.44 GHz, respectively.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging equipment incorporates
   protection that ensures that grid disturbances do not damage the charger
   or vehicle. When the grid voltage sags below 80\% of nominal,
   undervoltage protection is likely to disconnect the charging load from
   the grid. Most PEV charging will occur overnight, when non-PEV load is
   at a minimum. This paper argues that PEV voltage-sag response, when
   synchronized across large numbers of PEVs, could result in the loss of a
   significant proportion of the total load. It is shown that this load
   loss can lead to unacceptably high voltages once the initiating event
   has been cleared. This paper explores the nature of this voltage-rise
   phenomenon. Analysis tools are developed to assist in determining PEV
   loading conditions that demarcate acceptable postdisturbance voltage
   response from unacceptable outcomes. Two examples, based on standard
   distribution test systems, are used to illustrate PEV-induced
   overvoltage behavior, and demonstrate applications of the analysis
   tools.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes in situ dynamic calibration of microfabricated
   Pirani gauges, which are commonly used to measure vacuum levels in
   microsystems that may include pumps, valves, and other pressure
   modulation elements. Calibration is accomplished with a configuration
   where two sides of the supporting membrane of a Pirani gauge are at
   different pressures: an interior pressure within the microsystems and an
   exterior ambient pressure that can be directly controlled. This
   particular configuration is increasingly common as Pirani gauges are
   embedded in complex fluidic pathways such as those found in micro-gas
   chromatographs and multistage gas pumps. In the dynamic calibration the
   ambient pressure is rapidly modulated, while the interior pressure in
   the sense gap of the Pirani gauge remains relatively unchanged. The
   exterior pressure that is equal to the interior pressure is determined
   by a regression model. The dynamic calibration procedure and subsequent
   error analysis are illustrated by application to a 162-stage monolithic
   Knudsen vacuum pump. For this device, dynamic calibration improves the
   estimated upstream pressure from 30 (as suggested by uncorrected static
   calibration) to 0.9 Torr, with a 95.4\% confidence interval from 0.7 to
   1.1 Torr, assuming normal (Gaussian) distribution. These results
   demonstrate that dynamic calibration can be significantly more accurate
   than conventional static calibration for certain types of devices.

Abstract = {{We propose a novel strategy for BEMS (Building Energy Management
   System), which efficiently controls energy flows in a building so as to
   minimize the total cost of energy for a finite period. We also consider
   Demand Response (DR) events during the period. The proposed strategy
   includes prediction, long-term scheduling, and real-time control (RTC)
   of components within a building. During the period, the process from
   prediction to RTC is iterated in every time unit when the system status
   is changed by a dynamic environment. The scheduler determines the
   optimal energy flows based on the prediction, and RTC utilizes the
   scheduling result so that the energy flow can be adaptively controlled
   in a dynamic environment. Finally, the system status change information
   is fed back for the next iteration. Simulation results indicate
   potential cost savings that are approximately 10-20\% compared to a
   typical BEMS with a conventional RTC scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Intelligent Trip Modeling for the Prediction of an Origin-Destination

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of the traffic information in real time such as
   flow, density, speed, and travel time has important applications in many
   areas, including intelligent traffic control systems, optimizing vehicle
   operations, and the routing selection for individual drivers on the
   road. This is also a challenging problem due to dynamic changes of
   traffic states by many uncertain factors along a traveling route. In
   this paper, we present an Intelligent Trip Modeling System (ITMS) that
   was developed using machine learning to predict the traveling speed
   profile for a selected route based on the traffic information available
   at the trip starting time. The ITMS contains neural networks to predict
   short-term traffic speed based on the traveling day of the week, the
   traffic congestion levels at the sensor locations along the route, and
   the traveling time and distances to reach individual sensor locations.
   The ITMS was trained and evaluated by using ten months of traffic data
   provided by the California Freeway Performance Measurement System along
   a California Interstate I-405 route that is 26 mi long and contains 52
   traffic sensors. The ITMS was also evaluated by the traffic data
   acquired from a 32-mi-long freeway section in the state of Michigan.
   Experimental results show that the proposed system, i.e., ITMS, has the
   capability of providing accurate predictions of dynamic traffic changes
   and traveling speed at the beginning of a trip and can generalize well
   to prediction of speed profiles on the freeway routes other than the
   routes the system was trained on.}},

Abstract = {{A spray and evaporation model has been developed and embedded in a
   quasi-dimensional multi-zone direct injection internal combustion engine
   simulation framework. The model accounts for the behavior of the spray
   zone and fuel evaporation including sub-models for spray breakup,
   improved zone velocity estimations with transient fuel injection, spray
   penetration and tracking of evaporated fuel components. Each sub-model
   deals with multi-component fuel surrogates to simulate the real fuel
   effects. To enhance sensitivity of the model to the fuel components,
   additional thermophysical properties to the traditional spray model are
   incorporated. The ideal gas and the ideal solution are assumed in the
   model to retain computational efficiency. Finally, the model was
   validated against experiments and compared with other numerical methods.
   The ability of the new model to treat a multi-component fuel provides an
   improvement in the simulations of modern direct injection internal
   combustion engine when used with alternative fuels.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are attractive for use in peripheral
   nerve interfaces because of their unique combination of strength,
   flexibility, electrical conductivity and nanoscale surface texture. Here
   we investigated the growth of motor neurons on thin films of
   horizontally aligned CNTs (HACNTs). Approach. We cultured primary
   embryonic rat motor neurons on HACNTs and performed statistical analysis
   of the length and orientation of neurites. We next presented motor
   neurons with substrates of alternating stripes of HACNTs and SiO2. Main
   results. The neurons survived on HACNT substrates for up to eight days,
   which was the full duration of our experiments. Statistical analysis of
   the length and orientation of neurites indicated that the longest
   neurites on HACNTs tended to align with the CNT direction, although the
   average neurite length was similar between HACNTs and glass control
   substrates. We observed that when motor neurons were presented with
   alternating stripes of HACNTs and SiO2, the proportion of neurons on
   HACNTs increases over time, suggesting that neurons selectively migrate
   toward and adhere to the HACNT surface. Significance. The behavior of
   motor neurons on CNTs has not been previously investigated, and we show
   that aligned CNTs could provide a viable interface material to motor
   neurons. Combined with emerging techniques to build complex hierarchical
   structures of CNTs, our results suggest that organised CNTs could be
   incorporated into nerve grafts that use physical and electrical cues to
   guide regenerating axons.}},

Title = {{A DVH-guided IMRT optimization algorithm for automatic treatment
   planning and adaptive radiotherapy replanning}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a novel algorithm that incorporates prior treatment
   knowledge into intensity modulated radiation therapy optimization to
   facilitate automatic treatment planning and adaptive radiotherapy (ART)
   replanning.
   Methods: The algorithm automatically creates a treatment plan guided by
   the DVH curves of a reference plan that contains information on the
   clinician-approved dose-volume trade-offs among different targets/organs
   and among different portions of a DVH curve for an organ. In ART, the
   reference plan is the initial plan for the same patient, while for
   automatic treatment planning the reference plan is selected from a
   library of clinically approved and delivered plans of previously treated
   patients with similar medical conditions and geometry. The proposed
   algorithm employs a voxel-based optimization model and navigates the
   large voxel-based Pareto surface. The voxel weights are iteratively
   adjusted to approach a plan that is similar to the reference plan in
   terms of the DVHs. If the reference plan is feasible but not Pareto
   optimal, the algorithm generates a Pareto optimal plan with the DVHs
   better than the reference ones. If the reference plan is too restricting
   for the new geometry, the algorithm generates a Pareto plan with DVHs
   close to the reference ones. In both cases, the new plans have similar
   DVH trade-offs as the reference plans.
   Results: The algorithm was tested using three patient cases and found to
   be able to automatically adjust the voxel-weighting factors in order to
   generate a Pareto plan with similar DVH trade-offs as the reference
   plan. The algorithm has also been implemented on a GPU for high
   efficiency.
   Conclusions: A novel prior-knowledge-based optimization algorithm has
   been developed that automatically adjust the voxel weights and generate

Abstract = {{Our understanding of the intrinsic mechanosensitive properties of human
   pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), in particular the effects that the
   physical microenvironment has on their differentiation, remains
   elusive(1). Here, we show that neural induction and caudalization of
   hPSCs can be accelerated by using a synthetic microengineered substrate
   system consisting of poly(dimethylsiloxane) micropost arrays (PMAs) with
   tunable mechanical rigidities. The purity and yield of functional motor
   neurons derived from hPSCs within 23 days of culture using soft PMAs
   were improved more than fourfold and tenfold, respectively, compared
   with coverslips or rigid PMAs. Mechanistic studies revealed a
   multi-targeted mechano-transductive process involving Smad
   phosphorylation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, regulated by
   rigidity-dependent Hippo/YAP activities and actomyosin cytoskeleton
   integrity and contractility. Our findings suggest that substrate
   rigidity is an important biophysical cue influencing neural induction
   and subtype specification, and that microengineered substrates can thus
   serve as a promising platform for large-scale culture of hPSCs.}},

   related to transport properties, including connectivity and tortuosity,
   were measured from the resulting 3-D data sets. Connectivity of
   94.5-99.6\% was measured for samples produced with 35-60\% porogen
   (30.8-49.6\% porosity). Two methods of calculating tortuosity, path
   length ratio and gas phase flux were compared, and the effect of sample
   volume on calculated tortuosity value and computational time was
   examined. Average sample tortuosity calculated using the two methods
   generally agreed, although significant directional anisotropy was
   detected in some cases for the gas phase flux calculation method.
   Tortuosity values as low as 1.5 were measured for alumina components

Abstract = {{Injection of powdered activated carbon (PAC) into the combustion flue
   gas of a coal-fired boiler is a leading approach to reducing
   anthropogenic mercury emissions. Small particle size and poor electrical
   properties are known to make carbonaceous particles more difficult to
   remove from a gas stream by electrostatic precipitation, by far the
   dominant particulate control technology for coal-fired boilers. The
   present analysis estimates PAC emissions from electrostatic
   precipitators (ESPs) and considers both the operational factors driving
   such emissions as well as their implications in terms of adsorbed
   mercury concentrations and their potential to act as a climate forcing
   agent similar to black carbon. The results of the analysis find the
   potential for PAC to increase particulate carbon emissions by tens of
   percent to over 150 \% in the worst-case scenario considered. Such
   emissions could increase the contribution of coal combustion to total
   anthropogenic emissions of particulate carbon by several percentage
   points. Elevated levels of mercury on such emissions can translate into
   gas-phase-equivalent mercury concentrations approaching 1 ppb. The most
   important uncertainty influencing these results is the removal
   efficiency within ESPs of PM2.5-activated carbon particles.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal error, especially the one caused by the thermal expansion of
   spindle in axial direction, seriously impacts the accuracy of the
   precision machine tool. Thermal error compensation based on the thermal
   error model with high accuracy and robustness is an effective and
   economic way to reduce the impact and enhance the accuracy. Generally,
   thermal error models are built only on temperatures at some points in
   the spindle system. However, the thermal error is also closely related
   to other working parameters. Through the theoretical analysis, the
   simulation, and the experimental testing in this paper, it is found out
   that thermal error is determined by multiple variables, such as the
   temperature, the spindle rotation speed, the historical spindle
   temperature, the historical thermal error, and the time lag between the
   present and previous times. In order to examine the performance of
   thermal error models based on multiple variables, two common methods are
   used for modeling-the multiple regression method and the back
   propagation network. The data for modeling are collected from
   experiments conducted on the spindle of a precision machine tool under
   various working conditions. The modeling results demonstrate that models
   established based on the multiple variables have better accuracy and
   robustness. It also turns out that data filtering before modeling can
   further improve the performance of the models. Therefore, models based
   on multiple variables with good accuracy and robustness can be very
   useful for the further thermal error compensation. In addition, by
   taking relative importance analysis of multiple variables based on
   standardized regression coefficients, the influence of each variable to
   the thermal error is revealed. The ranking of coefficients can also be
   used as a new criterion for the optimal temperature variable selection
   in the future research.}},

   fibrous capsule and woven bone around the device body, and
   histomorphology analysis showed 64.17\% bone contact to device stem
   surface. The percentage bone volume calculated from micro-computed
   tomography analysis around the stem surface was found to be superior to
   that reported in previous studies of cemented mandibular endoprostheses.
   Intermodular connection screw loosening has also been resolved with the
   dovetail interconnection. In conclusion, the current bioactive-coated
   cementless mandibular endoprosthesis is feasible for use in mandibular
   segmental reconstruction. However, insufficient load-bearing capability
   and a high rate of intraoral wound dehiscence were found in the majority
   of the study animals. Further device modifications and improvements in
   the surgical technique need to be addressed in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Relieving phosphorus loading is a key management tool for controlling
   Lake Erie eutrophication. During the 1960s and 1970s, increased
   phosphorus inputs degraded water quality and reduced central basin
   hypolimnetic oxygen levels which, in turn, eliminated thermal habitat
   vital to cold-water organisms and contributed to the extirpation of
   important benthic macroinvertebrate prey species for fishes. In response
   to load reductions initiated in 1972, Lake Erie responded quickly with
   reduced water-column phosphorus concentrations, phytoplankton biomass,
   and bottom-water hypoxia (dissolved oxygen <2 mg/l). Since the
   mid-1990s, cyanobacteria blooms increased and extensive hypoxia and
   benthic algae returned. We synthesize recent research leading to
   guidance for addressing this re-eutrophication, with particular emphasis
   on central basin hypoxia. We document recent trends in key
   eutrophication-related properties, assess their likely ecological
   impacts, and develop load response curves to guide revised hypoxia-based
   loading targets called for in the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality
   Agreement. Reducing central basin hypoxic area to levels observed in the
   early 1990s (ca. 2000 km(2)) requires cutting total phosphorus loads by
   46\% from the 2003-2011 average or reducing dissolved reactive
   phosphorus loads by 78\% from the 2005-2011 average. Reductions to these
   levels are also protective of fish habitat We provide potential
   approaches for achieving those new loading targets, and suggest that
   recent load reduction recommendations focused on western basin
   cyanobacteria blooms may not be sufficient to reduce central basin
   hypoxia to 2000 km(2). (C) 2014 International Association for Great

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Capillary self-assembly of nanoscale filaments is an emerging means of
   fabricating complex and hierarchical surface textures. However, via
   conventional processing methods such as immersion in liquid and
   atmospheric pressure condensation of liquid onto the substrate, it is
   challenging to achieve uniform results over large areas and to adapt the
   process to structures with different dimensions and spacing. Here we
   study elastocapillary densification of carbon nanotube (CNT)
   microstructures via controlled low-pressure condensation of liquid and
   subsequent evaporation, with the structures placed on a temperature
   controlled substrate. We study the dynamics of liquid infiltration into
   the microstructures and achieve control over the liquid condensation
   rate within > 1 mu m s(-1). We find that the extent of densification
   depends on the amount of liquid delivered to the substrate as well as
   the size and spacing of the microstructures. We also show that the
   low-pressure condensation method can be used to form large arrays of
   anisotropic CNT microstructures, including thin-walled slanted
   microwells and tilted microposts.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports on the evaluation of a high resolution micro
   ultrasonic machining (HR-mu USM) process suitable for post fabrication
   trimming of complex 3D microstructures made from fused silica. Unlike
   conventional USM, the HR-mu USM process aims for low machining rates,
   providing high resolution and high surface quality. The machining rate
   is reduced by keeping the micro-tool tip at a fixed distance from the
   workpiece and vibrating it at a small amplitude. The surface roughness
   is improved by an appropriate selection of abrasive particles. Fluidic
   modeling is performed to study interaction among the vibrating
   micro-tool tip, workpiece, and the slurry. Using 304 stainless steel (
   SS304) tool tips of 50 mu m diameter, the machining performance of the
   HR-mu USM process is characterized on flat fused silica substrates. The
   depths and surface finish of machined features are evaluated as
   functions of slurry concentrations, separation between the micro-tool
   and workpiece, and machining time. Under the selected conditions, the
   HR-mu USM process achieves machining rates as low as 10 nm s(-1)
   averaged over the first minute of machining of a flat virgin sample.
   This corresponds to a mass removal rate of approximate to 20 ng min(-1).
   The average surface roughness, Sa, achieved is as low as 30 nm.
   Analytical and numerical modeling are used to explain the typical
   profile of the machined features as well as machining rates. The process
   is used to demonstrate trimming of hemispherical 3D shells made of fused
   silica.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile phones hold considerable promise for delivering evidence-based
   smoking cessation interventions that require frequent and objective
   assessment of smoking status via breath carbon monoxide (Breath CO)
   measurement. However, there are currently no commercially available
   mobile-phone-based Breath CO meters. We developed a mobile-phone-based
   Breath CO meter prototype that attaches to and communicates with a
   smartphone through an audio port. We then evaluated the reliability and
   the validity of Breath CO measures collected with the mobile meter
   prototype and assessed the usability and acceptability of the meter.
   Participants included 20 regular smokers (a parts per thousand yen10
   cigarettes/day), 20 light smokers (< 10 cigarettes/day), and 20
   nonsmokers. Expired air samples were collected 4 times from each
   participant: twice with the mobile meter and twice with a commercially
   available Breath CO meter.
   Measures calculated by the mobile meter correlated strongly with
   measures calculated by the commercial meter (r = .96, p < .001).
   Additionally, the mobile meter accurately distinguished between smokers
   and nonsmokers. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic
   curve for the mobile meter was 94.7\%, and the meter had a combined
   sensitivity and specificity of 1.86 at an abstinence threshold of a
   parts per thousand currency sign6 ppm. Responses on an acceptability
   survey indicated that smokers liked the meter and would be interested in
   using it during a quit attempt.
   The results of our study suggest that a mobile-phone-based Breath CO
   meter is a reliable, valid, and acceptable device for distinguishing
   between smokers and nonsmokers.}},

Title = {{Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface Viability and Signal
   Transduction with an Implanted Electrode}},

Abstract = {{Background: The regenerative peripheral nerve interface is an internal
   interface for signal transduction with external electronics of
   prosthetic limbs; it consists of an electrode and a unit of free muscle
   that is neurotized by a transected residual peripheral nerve. Adding a
   conductive polymer coating on electrodes improves electrode
   conductivity. This study examines regenerative peripheral nerve
   interface tissue viability and signal fidelity in the presence of an
   implanted electrode coated or uncoated with a conductive polymer.
   Methods: In a rat model, the extensor digitorum longus muscle was moved
   as a nonvascularized free tissue transfer and neurotized by the divided
   peroneal nerve. Either a stainless steel pad electrode (n = 8) or a pad
   electrode coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) conductive
   polymer (PEDOT) (n = 8) was implanted on the muscle transfer and secured
   with an encircling acellular extracellular matrix. The contralateral
   muscle served as the control.
   Results: The free muscle transfers were successfully revascularized and
   over time reinnervated as evidenced by serial insertional needle
   electromyography. Compound muscle action potentials were successfully
   transduced through the regenerative peripheral nerve interface. The
   conductive polymer coating on the implanted electrode resulted in
   increased recorded signal amplitude that was observed throughout the
   course of the study. Histologic examination confirmed axonal sprouting,
   elongation, and synaptogenesis within regenerative peripheral nerve
   interface regardless of electrode type.
   Conclusions: The regenerative peripheral nerve interface remains viable
   over seven months in the presence of an implanted electrode. Electrodes
   with and without conductive polymer reliably transduced signals from the
   regenerative peripheral nerve interface. Electrodes with a conductive

Abstract = {{In random-chopped fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites used as a
   retrofit material, a high volume fraction of voids is inevitable due to
   the manufacturing characteristics. In this paper, the mechanical
   characteristics and strengthening effectiveness of random-chopped FRP
   composites containing air porosity are investigated through experiments
   and numerical analysis. Coupon-shaped specimens with various material
   compositions were manufactured to examine the uniaxial tensile
   performance, and the air voids in the composites were measured by a
   microscope camera. In order to predict the overall performance of the
   composites, a micromechanical formulation that accounts for porosity was
   newly developed. The derived model was incorporated into a finite
   element (FE) code, and the model parameters were estimated by comparing
   uniaxial tensile test results for various systems of random-chopped FRP
   composites. In addition, concrete beams strengthened with the composites
   were produced to evaluate their load-carrying capacity. The FE
   predictions of the composite structures were then compared with
   experimental data to verify the predictive capability of the proposed
   numerical framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the photostability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell
   active layers comprised of the archetype donor, boron-subphthalocyanine
   chloride (SubPc), and fullerene acceptors, aged under either AM1.5G
   illumination or in the dark, and in either air or inert atmosphere.
   Under long-term exposure to light, we observe significant photobleaching
   and crystallization of SubPc. Mixing SubPc with C-60 as is commonly done
   in high efficiency small molecule OPVs, the crystallite formation is
   inhibited and the bleaching is suppressed due to a significantly reduced
   exciton lifetime in the blends. Furthermore, the spectral dependence of
   the degradation suggests that photo-dimerization of C-60 is an important
   factor leading to burn-in loss in efficiency previously reported in
   SubPc/C-60 OPVs. The existence of dimerization is supported by Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy data taken both before and after
   exposure to light Increasing the fraction of SubPc in a SubPc:C-60 blend
   leads to a decrease in the rate of film degradation, providing further
   evidence for C-60 dimerization. Due to its reduced tendency for
   photo-dimerization, C-70 is more stable than C-60 when used in small
   molecule OPVs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Real Option Perspective to Value the Multi-Stage Construction of
   Rainwater Harvesting Systems Reusing Septic Tank}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2279-2291}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recently, rainwater harvesting systems have received increased attention
   due to their capability for adapting to water scarcity and climate
   change. However, a key obstacle to the implementation of rainwater
   harvesting systems is that they are often not financially feasible given
   difficulty in determining optimal system size. A key premise of previous
   studies was that all rainwater harvesting systems are constructed in a
   single construction event even though it is possible to construct a
   system in multiple stages. This assumption limits managerial flexibility
   in the construction of rainwater harvesting systems, which is
   particularly valuable in scenarios where it is difficult to forecast
   future rainfall patterns. Therefore, we propose a multi-stage system
   expansion strategy for the implementation of rainwater harvesting
   systems using decommissioned septic tanks under scenarios of uncertainty
   in rainfall from a real option perspective as a means to improve the
   financial feasibility of implementing rainwater harvesting systems. We
   tested this strategy by evaluating a proposed rainwater harvesting
   system for a midsize apartment complex in Jeonju, South Korea. The
   multi-stage expansion strategy generated an option value of 9,896 USD.
   This study will help to improve the financial feasibility of rainwater
   harvesting systems by adding the value of managerial flexibility through
   a sequential expansion of RWH systems as new information becomes
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Two surrogates are developed using a model-based optimizer to emulate
   the fuel properties affecting the spray development and gas phase
   ignition of a conventional jet fuel. The first surrogate, UM1, is a
   mixture of n-dodecane/iso-cetane/methylcyclohexane/toluene
   (0.3844/0.1484/0.2336/0.2336 mol fraction), while the second, UM2, is a
   mixture of n-dodecane/iso-cetane/decalin/toluene
   (0.2897/0.1424/0.3188/0.2491 mol fraction). The developed surrogates
   contain hydrocarbon species that are available in existing chemical
   mechanisms, and emulate both the physical and chemical properties of a
   representative real jet fuel, Jet-A POSF-4658. POSF-4658 is suitable as
   a surrogate target fuel since the properties of POSF-4658 are
   representatives of a nominal Jet-A, and a wide range of experimental
   POSF-4658 data is readily available, including multiple ignition delay
   measurements. While the UM1 surrogate gives a much tighter match for
   temperature-independent properties, UM2 is shown to better emulate
   liquid density and volatility, properties which are known to be
   important to spray predictions under engine relevant conditions. The new
   UM surrogates improve upon emulation of the chemical and physical
   properties of POSF-4658 compared with surrogates that currently exist in
   the literature. Ignition delay times predicted with a detailed chemical
   mechanism and the newly developed surrogate compositions under diesel
   relevant conditions show reasonable agreement with shock tube and rapid
   compression machine experiments. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{One way to provide powered lower limb prostheses with greater
   adaptability to a wearer's intent is to use a neural signal to provide
   feedforward control of prosthesis mechanics. We designed and tested the
   feasibility of an experimental powered ankle-foot prosthesis that uses
   pneumatic artificial muscles and proportional myoelectric control to
   vary ankle mechanics during walking. The force output of the artificial
   plantar flexor muscles was directly proportional to the subject's
   residual gastrocnemius muscle activity. The maximum force generated by a
   pair of artificial muscles fixed at nominal length was 3513 N. The
   maximum planter flexion torque that could be generated during walking
   was 176 Nm. The force bandwidth of the pneumatic artificial muscles was
   2 Hz. The electromechanical delay was 33 ms, the time to peak tension
   was 48 ms, and the half relaxation time was 50 ms. We used two
   artificial muscles as dorsiflexors and two artificial muscles as plantar
   flexors. The prosthetic ankle had 25 deg of dorsiflexion and 35 deg of
   plantar flexion with the artificial muscles uninflated. The intent of
   the device was not to create a commercially viable prosthesis but to
   have a laboratory prototype to test principles of locomotor adaptation
   and biomechanics. We recruited one unilateral trans-tibial amputee to
   walk on a treadmill at 1.0 m/s while wearing the powered prosthesis. We
   recorded muscle activity within the subject's prescribed prosthetic
   socket using surface electrodes. The controller was active throughout
   the entire gait cycle and did not rely on detection of gait phases. The
   amputee subject quickly adapted to the powered prosthesis and walked
   with a functional gait. The subject generated peak ankle power at push
   off that was similar between amputated and prosthetic sides. Our results
   suggest that amputees can use their residual muscles for proportional
   myoelectric control to alter prosthetic mechanics during walking.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Silicone-based tissue-mimicking phantom is widely used as a surrogate of

   This study investigates using the mineral oil in room-temperature

   needle insertion characteristics of a tissue-mimicking phantom. Silicone
   samples mixed with 0, 20, 30, and 40 wt. \% mineral oil were fabricated
   for indentation and needle insertion tests and compared to four types of
   porcine tissues (liver, muscle with the fiber perpendicular or parallel
   to the needle, and fat). The results demonstrated that the elastic
   modulus and needle insertion force of the phantom both decrease with an
   increasing concentration of mineral oil. Use of the mineral oil in
   silicone could effectively tailor the elastic modulus and needle
   insertion force to mimic the soft tissue. The silicone mixed with 40 wt.
   \% mineral oil was found to be the best tissue-mimicking phantom and can

Abstract = {{Ultrasound-driven microbubble activities have been exploited to
   transiently disrupt the cell membrane (sonoporation) for non-viral
   intracellular drug delivery and gene transfection both in vivo and in
   vitro. In this study, we investigated the dynamic behaviors of a
   population of microbubbles exposed to pulsed ultrasound and their impact
   on adherent cells in terms of intracellular delivery and cell viability.
   By systematically analyzing the bubble activities at time scales
   relevant to pulsed ultrasound exposure, we identified two quantification
   parameters that categorize the diverse bubble activities subjected to
   various ultrasound conditions into three characteristic behaviors:
   stable cavitation/aggregation (type I), growth/coalescence and
   translation (type II) and localized inertial cavitation/collapse (type
   III). Correlation of the bubble activities with sonoporation outcome
   suggested that type III behavior resulted in intracellular delivery,
   whereas type II behavior caused the death of a large number of cells.
   These results provide useful insights for rational selection of
   ultrasound parameters to optimize outcomes of sonoporation and other
   applications that exploit the use of ultrasound-driven bubble
   activities. (E-mail: cxdeng@umich.edu) (C) 2014 World Federation for

Title = {{ECG Morphological Variability in Beat Space for Risk Stratification
   After Acute Coronary Syndrome}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background-Identification of patients who are at high risk of adverse
   cardiovascular events after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a
   major challenge in clinical cardiology. We hypothesized that quantifying
   variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) morphology may improve risk
   stratification post-ACS.
   Methods and Results-We developed a new metric to quantify beat-to-beat
   morphologic changes in the ECG: morphologic variability in beat space
   (MVB), and compared our metric to published ECG metrics (heart rate
   variability {[}HRV], deceleration capacity {[}DC], T-wave alternans,
   heart rate turbulence, and severe autonomic failure). We tested the
   ability of these metrics to identify patients at high risk of
   cardiovascular death (CVD) using 1082 patients (1-year CVD rate, 4.5\%)
   from the MERLIN-TIMI 36 (Metabolic Efficiency with Ranolazine for Less
   Ischemia in Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome-Thrombolysis in
   Myocardial Infarction 36) clinical trial. DC, HRV/low frequency-high
   frequency, and MVB were all associated with CVD (hazard ratios {[}HRs]
   from 2.1 to 2.3 {[}P<0.05 for all] after adjusting for the TIMI risk
   score {[}TRS], left ventricular ejection fraction {[}LVEF], and B-type
   natriuretic peptide {[}BNP]). In a cohort with low-to-moderate TRS
   (N=864; 1-year CVD rate, 2.7\%), only MVB was significantly associated
   with CVD (HR, 3.0; P=0.01, after adjusting for LVEF and BNP).
   Conclusions-ECG morphological variability in beat space contains
   prognostic information complementary to the clinical variables, LVEF and
   BNP, in patients with low-to-moderate TRS. ECG metrics could help to
   risk stratify patients who might not otherwise be considered at high
   risk of CVD post-ACS.}},

Journal = {{WIND ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{869-876}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The long composite blades on large wind turbines experience tremendous
   stresses while in operation. There is an interest in implementing
   structural health monitoring (SHM) systems inside wind turbine blades to
   alert maintenance teams of damage before serious component failure
   occurs. This paper proposes using an energy harvesting device inside the
   blade of a horizontal axis wind turbine to power a SHM system. The
   harvester is a linear induction energy harvester placed radially along
   the length of the blade. The rotation of the blade causes a magnet to
   slide along a tube as the blade axis changes relative to the direction
   of gravity. The magnet induces a voltage in a coil around the tube, and
   this voltage powers the SHM system. This paper begins by discussing
   motivation for this project. Next, a harvester model is developed, which
   encompasses the mechanics of the magnet, the interaction between the
   magnet and the coil, and the current in the electrical circuit. A free
   fall test verifies the electromechanical coupling model, and a rotating
   test examines the power output of a prototype harvester. Copyright (c)

   response of non-uniformly heated structures}},
Journal = {{FINITE ELEMENTS IN ANALYSIS AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{58-67}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A generalized shell heat transfer element is formulated in isoparametric
   coordinates to simulate the 3D thermal of non-uniformly heated shells
   with curved geometries. The element uses a combination of finite element
   and control volume methods to discretize the domain of the element into
   2D layers that are coupled by a finite difference calculation. As
   demonstrated in previous work, the finite element control volume
   formulation allows the thermal response to be evaluated with minimal
   computational expense and the temperature field is calculated in a
   manner that is compatible with distributed plasticity elements for
   structural analysis. Although the formulation uses a mixture of finite
   element and finite difference equations, the element equations are in a
   form that can readily be implemented in a commercial finite element
   code. The nine-node quadratic element considered here is implemented in
   Abaqus as a user-defined element. One-, two-, and three-dimensional
   verification cases are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the
   element. Comparisons between the shell heat transfer element and
   traditional continuum heat transfer elements illustrate that the shell
   element converges rapidly and results insignificant savings in
   computational expense. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A theory for controlling avalanche process of carrier during short pulse

   avalanche process and photon ionization process to the generation of

Abstract = {{Through systematic examination of symmetrically nonequivalent

   x-ray diffraction studies at and below room temperature and also is
   consistent with transport properties. Magnetoresistance measurements at
   liquid helium temperatures exhibit cusp-shaped field dependence at low
   fields and evolve into quasilinear field dependence at intermediate and
   high fields. These results reveal the existence of weak antilocalization
   effect, which has been analyzed using a modified Hikami, Larkin, and
   Nagaoka model, including a quantum interference term and a classical
   quadratic contribution. Fitting parameters suggest a quantum coherence
   length L of 175 nm at 1.8 K. With increasing temperature, the classical
   parabolic behavior becomes more dominant, and L decreases as a power law

Abstract = {{Successful and fast cold start is important for proton exchange membrane
   (PEM) fuel cell in vehicular applications in addition to the desired
   maximum power in any case. In this study, the maximum power cold start
   mode is investigated in details and compared with other cold start modes
   based on a multiphase stack model. It is found that for the maximum
   power cold start mode, the current density is generally kept at high
   levels, and the performance improvement caused by the membrane hydration
   and temperature increment may not be observable. Therefore, before the
   melting point, the performance drops continuously. The maximum power
   cold start mode could better balance the heat generation and ice
   formation, leading to improved cold start survivability than that in the
   constant voltage and constant current modes, with a fast start-up
   generally guaranteed. Once the survivability can be ensured, the initial
   water content needs to be higher for fast cold start, suggesting that
   over purging should be avoided. The maximum power mode is suggested to
   be optimal for PEM fuel cell cold start based on the modeling results.

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that Na ions are mobile at room temperature in the
   nitridophosphate compound Na3TiP3O9N, with a diffusion pathway that is
   calculated to be fully three-dimensional and isotropic. When used as
   cathode in Na-ion batteries, Na3TiP3O9N has an average voltage of 2.7 V
   vs Na+/Na and cycles with good reversibility through a mechanism that
   appears to be a single solid solution process without any intermediate
   plateaus. X-ray and neutron diffraction studies as well as
   first-principles calculations indicate that the volume change that
   occurs on Na-ion removal is only about 0.5\%, a remarkably small volume
   change given the large ionic radius of Na+ Rietveld refinements indicate
   that the Na1 site is selectively depopulated during sodium removal.
   Furthermore, the refined displacement parameters support theoretical
   predictions that the lowest energy diffusion pathway incorporates the
   Na1 and Na3 sites while the Na2 site is relatively inaccessible. The
   measured room temperature ionic conductivity of Na3TiP3O9N is
   substantial (4 X 10(-7) S/cm), though both the strong temperature
   dependence of Na-ion thermal parameters and the observed activation
   energy of 0.54 eV suggest that much higher ionic conductivities can be
   achieved with minimal heating. Excellent thermal stability is observed
   for both pristine Na3TiP3O9N and desodiated Na2TiP3O9N, suggesting that
   this phase can serve as a safe Na-ion battery electrode. Moreover, it is
   expected that further optimization of the general cubic framework of
   Na3TiP3O9N by chemical substitution will result in thermostable solid
   state electrolytes with isotropic conductivities that can function at
   temperatures near or just above room temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Heterojunction interfaces between metal oxides are often highly lattice
   mismatched. The atomic and electronic structures of such interfaces,
   however, are not well understood. We have synthesized Cu2O/TiO2
   heterojunction thin films with 13\% lattice mismatch and studied the
   interface via experimental methods and large-scale density function
   theory calculations of supercells containing similar to 1300 atoms. We
   find that an interface of epitaxial quality is formed via a coincidence
   site lattice of 8 Cu2O unit cells matching 9 TiO2 unit cells.
   Calculations reveal the existence of a dislocation core of the O
   sublattices at the interface and a random arrangement of one layer of
   interfacial Cu atoms. The interfacial electronic structure is found to
   be mostly determined by the interfacial Cu distribution, rather than by
   the O dislocation core. The conduction band minimum and valence band
   maximum states are spatially separated, and there is no strongly
   localized state near the core. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Direct fabrication of graphene on SiO2 enabled by thin film stress
   engineering}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate direct production of graphene on SiO2 by CVD growth of
   graphene at the interface between a Ni film and the SiO2 substrate,
   followed by dry mechanical delamination of the Ni using adhesive tape.
   This result is enabled by understanding of the competition between
   stress evolution and microstructure development upon annealing of the Ni
   prior to the graphene growth step. When the Ni film remains adherent
   after graphene growth, the balance between residual stress and adhesion
   governs the ability to mechanically remove the Ni after the CVD process.
   In this study the graphene on SiO2 comprises micron-scale domains,
   ranging from monolayer to multilayer. The graphene has > 90\% coverage
   across centimeter-scale dimensions, limited by the size of our CVD
   chamber. Further engineering of the Ni film microstructure and stress
   state could enable manufacturing of highly uniform interfacial graphene
   followed by clean mechanical delamination over practically indefinite
   dimensions. Moreover, our findings suggest that preferential adhesion
   can enable production of 2-D materials directly on application-relevant
   substrates. This is attractive compared to transfer methods, which can
   cause mechanical damage and leave residues behind.}},

Abstract = {{Iron chalcogenides hold considerable promise for energy conversion and
   biomedical applications. Realization of this promise has been hindered
   by the lack of control over the crystallinity and nanoscale organization
   of iron chalcogenide films. High-quality nanoparticles (NPs) from these
   semiconductors will afford further studies of photophysical processes in
   them. Phase-pure NPs from these semiconductors can also serve as
   building blocks for mesoscale iron chalcogenide assemblies. Herein we
   report a synthetic method for FeSex (x = 1, 2) NPs with a diameter of
   ca. 30 nm that satisfy these needs. The high crystallinity of the
   individual NPs was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. TEM tomography images suggest
   pucklike NP shapes that can be rationalized by bond relaxation at the NP
   edges, as demonstrated in large-scale atomic models. The prepared FeSex
   NPs display strong photoluminescence with a quantum yield of 20\%, which
   was previously unattainable for iron chalcogenides. Moreover, they also
   show strong off-resonant luminescence due to two-photon absorption,
   which should be valuable for biological applications.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation necrosis is an uncommon but severe adverse effect of brain
   radiation therapy (RT). Current predictive models based on radiation
   dose have limited accuracy. We aimed to identify early individual
   response biomarkers based upon diffusion tensor (DT) imaging and
   incorporated them into a response model for prediction of radiation
   necrosis. Twenty-nine patients with glioblastoma received six weeks of
   intensity modulated RT and concurrent temozolomide. Patients underwent
   DT-MRI scans before treatment, at three weeks during RT, and one, three,
   and six months after RT. Cases with radiation necrosis were classified
   based on generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) of whole brain and
   DT index early changes in the corpus callosum and its substructures.
   Significant covariates were used to develop normal tissue complication
   probability models using binary logistic regression. Seven patients
   developed radiation necrosis. Percentage changes of radial diffusivity
   (RD) in the splenium at three weeks during RT and at six months after RT
   differed significantly between the patients with and without necrosis (p
   = 0.05 and p = 0.01). Percentage change ofRDat threeweeks during RT in
   the 30 Gy dose-volume of the splenium and brain gEUD combined yielded
   the best-fit logistic regression model. Our findings indicate that early
   individual response during the course of RT, assessed by radial
   diffusivity, has the potential to aid the prediction of delayed
   radiation necrosis, which could provide guidance in dose-escalation
   trials.}},

Abstract = {{Catalysts containing 7 wt\% Ni were prepared by impregnation of
   anatase-phase TiO2 and Ce-doped TiO2 that were synthesized by sol gel
   techniques. The catalysts were extensively characterized by a variety of
   methods including BET surface area measurements, temperature programmed
   H-2 reduction (H-2-TPR), scanning transmission electron microscopy
   (STEM), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
   (DRIFTS) for CO adsorption. The crystallography, crystallite size,
   microstrain in the crystalline structure and concentration of all phases
   in the catalysts were determined by X-ray diffraction and refinement of
   the crystalline structure with the Rietveld method. As catalytic probe
   reaction, the stoichiometric oxidation of CO by NO was used. Doping with
   ceria. affected the crystallography of the anatase-phase titania,
   increased the structural defects, and decreased the anatase crystallite
   size. This, in turn, led to more extensive contact of nickel particles
   with the support facilitating the reduction of nickel and of the surface
   of the Ce-doped TiO2. Among the various catalysts investigated, the
   Ce-doped Ni/TiO2 catalyst with a Ce/(Ce + Ti) ratio of 0.1 was found to
   be the most active for CO oxidation by NO. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate emerging anaerobic membrane
   bioreactor (AnMBR) technology in comparison with conventional wastewater
   energy recovery technologies. Wastewater treatment process modeling and
   systems analyses were combined to evaluate the conditions under which
   AnMBR may produce more net energy and have lower life cycle
   environmental emissions than high rate activated sludge with anaerobic
   digestion (HRAS+AD), conventional activated sludge with anaerobic
   digestion (CAS+AD), and an aerobic membrane bioreactor with anaerobic
   digestion (AeMBR+AD). For medium strength domestic wastewater treatment
   under baseline assumptions at 15 degrees C, AnMBR recovered 49\% more
   energy as biogas than HRAS+AD, the most energy positive conventional
   technology considered, but had significantly higher energy demands and
   environmental emissions. Global warming impacts associated with AnMBR
   were largely due to emissions of effluent dissolved methane. For high
   strength domestic wastewater treatment, AnMBR recovered 15\% more net
   energy than HRAS+AD, and the environmental emissions gap between the two
   systems was reduced. Future developments of AnMBR technology in low
   energy fouling control, increased flux, and management of effluent
   methane emissions would make AnMBR competitive with HRAS+AD. Rapid
   advancements in AnMBR technology must continue to achieve its full
   economic and environmental potential as an energy recovery strategy for
   domestic wastewater.}},

Title = {{A Bayesian generative model for learning semantic hierarchies}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Building fine-grained visual recognition systems that are capable of
   recognizing tens of thousands of categories, has received much attention
   in recent years. The well known semantic hierarchical structure of
   categories and concepts, has been shown to provide a key prior which
   allows for optimal predictions. The hierarchical organization of various
   domains and concepts has been subject to extensive research, and led to
   the development of the Word Net domains hierarchy (Fellbaum, 1998),
   which was also used to organize the images in the Image Net (Deng et
   al., 2009) dataset, in which the category count approaches the human
   capacity. Still, for the human visual system, the form of the hierarchy
   must be discovered with minimal use of supervision or innate knowledge.
   In this work, we propose a new Bayesian generative model for learning
   such domain hierarchies, based on semantic input. Our model is motivated
   by the super-subordinate organization of domain labels and concepts that
   characterizes WordNet, and accounts for several important challenges:
   maintaining context information when progressing deeper into the
   hierarchy, learning a coherent semantic concept for each node, and
   modeling uncertainty in the perception process.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial cell-secreted factors
   contribute to the pathobiology of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) by
   enhancing invasive migration and resistance to anoikis. Here, we report
   that SCC cells within the perivascular niche have undergone epithelial
   to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a primary human SCC of a patient that
   developed distant metastases. Endothelial cell-secreted EGF induced EMT
   of human SCC cells in vitro and also induced acquisition of a stem-like
   phenotype. In vivo, tumor xenografts vascularized with EGF-silenced
   endothelial cells exhibited a smaller fraction of cancer stem-like cells
   (ALDH(+)CD44(+)) and were less invasive than tumors vascularized with
   control endothelial cells. Collectively, these results demonstrated that
   endothelial cell-EGF induces EMT and acquisition of stem-like properties
   by head and neck tumor cells. On this basis, we suggest that vascular
   endothelial cells contribute to tumor dissemination by secreting factors
   that endow carcinoma cells with enhanced motility and stemness. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) can produce iron sulfide (FeS) solids
   with mineralogical characteristics that may be beneficial for a variety
   of biogeochemical applications, such as long-term immobilization of
   uranium. In this study, the growth and metabolism of Desulfovibrio
   vulgaris, one of the best-studied SRB species, were comprehensively
   monitored in batch studies, and the biogenic FeS solids were
   characterized by X-ray diffraction. Controlling the pH by varying the
   initial pH, the iron-to-sulfate ratio, or the electron donor - affected
   the growth of D. vulgaris and strongly influenced the formation and
   growth of FeS solids. In particular, lower pH (from initial conditions
   or a decrease caused by less sulfate reduction, FeS precipitation, or
   using pyruvate as the electron donor) produced larger-sized mackinawite
   (Fe1+xS). Greater accumulation of free sulfide, from more sulfate
   reduction by D. vulgaris, also led to larger-sized mackinawite and
   particularly stimulated mackinawite transformation to greigite (Fe3S4)
   when the free sulfide concentration was 29.3 mM. Furthermore, sufficient
   free Fe2+ led to the additional formation of vivianite
   {[}Fe-3(PO4)(2)center dot 8(H2O)]. Thus, microbially relevant conditions
   (initial pH, choice of electron donor, and excess or deficiency of
   sulfide) are tools to generate biogenic FeS solids of different
   characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal conductivities of crystalline and amorphous CuPc structures
   have been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. To this end, a
   Hybrid-COMPASS force field for the CuPc molecule has been developed and
   parametrized using ab initio and empirical parametrization techniques.
   The valence parameters and atomic partial charges were derived by
   fitting to ab initio calculation results, and the van der Waals (vdW)
   parameters were derived by comparing MD simulations of CuPc crystal
   structures to experimentally determined characteristics. The resulting
   force field successfully predicts accurate molecular structure, crystal
   structure, and vibration density of states (VDOS) of CuPc molecule in
   isolation and in condensed phase. Thermal conductivities calculated
   using the Green-Kubo formalism show a significant difference between
   crystalline and amorphous CuPc. Further analysis of the thermal
   conductivity spectral modes reveals that this difference mainly stems
   from the scattering of acoustic phonons, and to a lesser extent from the
   suppression of optical phonon modes in the amorphous structure.
   Accordingly, phonon scattering at amorphous domain walls in
   nanocrystalline materials effectively eliminates nearly two-thirds of
   conduction pathways.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Quantitative studies of nanoscale heat dissipation (Joule heating) are
   essential for advancing nano-science and technology. Joule heating is
   widely expected to play a critical role in accelerating electromigration
   induced device failure. However, limitations in quantitatively probing
   temperature fields-with nanoscale resolution-have hindered elucidation
   of the role of Joule heating in electromigration. In this work, we use
   ultra-high vacuum scanning thermal microscopy to directly quantify
   thermal fields in nanowires during electromigration. Our results
   unambiguously illustrate that electromigration begins at temperatures
   significantly lower than the melting temperature of gold. Further, we
   show that during electromigration voids predominantly accumulate at the
   cathode resulting in both local hot spots and asymmetric temperature
   distributions. These results provide novel insights into the microscopic
   details of hot spot evolution during electromigration and are expected
   to guide the design of reliable nanoscale functional devices.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{70}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The isothermal coarsening of dendritic Al-Cu microstructures is examined
   using time-resolved, in situ synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic
   microscopy. By obtaining the data at the coarsening temperature (in
   situ) with speeds that are on the order of or faster than the ongoing
   evolution of the microstructure (time-resolved, 4-D), we examine the
   dynamic morphological evolution of the solid liquid interfaces in two
   solid volume fractions; as such, the relationship between the velocity
   of the evolving interface and characteristics that define the morphology
   of the interface is determined. We find that, while there is a
   correlation between velocity and mean curvature of the interface, there
   is a significant dispersion in the velocities for a given value of mean
   curvature. In addition, the Gaussian curvature plays a role in
   determining the interface velocity even though it has no effect on the
   chemical potential at the interface. We find that there are many
   interface patches of various morphologies and size scales that are not
   evolving during the coarsening process. At higher solid volume fractions
   and longer coarsening times, more of the structure is active in the
   coarsening process, and there is an increase in localized diffusional
   interactions. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The properties of the Li2O2 discharge phase are expected to impact
   strongly the performance of Li-air batteries. Although both crystalline
   Li2O2 (c-Li2O2) and amorphous Li2O2 (a-Li2O2) have been reported to form
   in Li-air cells, little is known regarding possible differences in
   charge and mass transport within these phases. To reveal these
   differences, here we predict the properties of a-Li2O2 using
   first-principles ``melt-and-quench{''} molecular dynamics and
   percolation theory. We find that the band gaps and equilibrium
   electrochemical potentials of c-Li2O2 and a-Li2O2 are similar;
   nevertheless, their transport properties are quite different.
   Importantly, the ionic conductivity of a-Li2O2 is predicted to be 2 X
   10(-7) S/cm, which is 12 orders of magnitude larger than that in the
   crystalline phase. This enhancement arises from increases in both the
   concentration and mobility of negative lithium vacancies. The electronic
   conductivity of a-Li2O2 is also enhanced, but to a much smaller extent
   (4 orders of magnitude), and remains low overall, 2 x 10(-16) S/cm.
   These data suggest that the formation of amorphous Li2O2 during
   discharge may enhance cell performance if charge or mass transport
   through the discharge product is a rate-limiting process.}},

Abstract = {{Films grown through the anodic oxidation of metal substrates are
   promising for applications ranging from solar cells to medical devices,
   but the underlying mechanisms of anodic growth are not fully understood.
   To provide a better understanding of these mechanisms, we present a new
   1D model for the anodization of aluminum. In this model, a thin space
   charge region at the oxide/electrolyte interface couples the bulk ionic
   transport and the interfacial reactions. Charge builds up in this
   region, which alters the surface overpotential until the reaction and
   bulk fluxes are equal. The model reactions at the oxide/electrolyte
   interface are derived from the Valand-Heusler model, with modifications
   to allow for deviations from stoichiometry at the interface and the
   saturation of adsorption sites. The rate equations and equilibrium
   concentrations of adsorbed species at the oxide/electrolyte interface
   are obtained from the reactions using Butler-Volmer kinetics, whereas
   transport-limited reaction kinetics are utilized at the metal/oxide
   interface. The ionic transport through the bulk oxide is modeled using a
   newly proposed cooperative transport process, the counter-site defect
   mechanism. The model equations are evolved numerically. The model is
   parametrized and validated using experimental data in the literature for
   the rate of ejection of aluminum species into the electrolyte, embedded
   charge at the oxide/electrolyte interface, and the barrier thickness and
   growth rate of porous films. The parametrized model predicts that the
   embedded charge at the oxide/electrolyte interface decreases
   monotonically for increasing electrolyte pH at constant current density.
   The parametrized model also predicts that the embedded charge during
   potentiostatic anodization is at its steady-state value; the embedded
   charge at any given time is equal to the embedded charge during
   galvanostatic anodization at the same current. In addition to
   simulations of anodized barrier films, this model can be extended to
   multiple dimensions to simulate anodic nanostructure growth.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous oxide semiconductors are of increasing interest for a variety
   of thin film electronics applications. Here, the contact properties of
   different source/drain electrode materials to solution-processed
   amorphous zinc tin oxide (ZTO) thin-film transistors are studied using

   which is 10, 20, and 600 times smaller than that of gold/titanium,
   indium tin oxide, and evaporated molybdenum electrodes, respectively.
   The superior contact formed using sputtered molybdenum is due to a
   favorable work function lineup, an insulator-free interface, bombardment
   of ZTO during molybdenum sputtering, and trap-assisted tunneling. The
   transfer length of the sputtered molybdenum/ZTO contact is 0.34 mu m,
   opening the door to future radiofrequency sub-micron molybdenum/ZTO thin

Abstract = {{The large atomic-size mismatch between In and Ga and the large
   lattice-mismatch strain between InAs and GaAs make the InAs/GaAs (001)
   growth interface a complex alloy system, the understanding of which can
   enhance control of device synthesis and nanostructure self-assembly. We
   present a detailed first-principles analysis of the full progression of
   surface reconstructions observed on the InAs/GaAs(001) wetting layer
   during early stages of In deposition. We use systematic techniques to
   identify the most likely surface reconstruction prototypes of the InAs
   wetting layer on GaAs(001) using density functional theory (DFT) and
   then develop several cluster expansion Hamiltonians in order to
   thoroughly explore surface alloy disorder due to species substitution of
   In, Ga, and As at the surface. We use these results to construct a first
   principles 0-K surface phase diagram of the InAs wetting layer on
   GaAs(001) and test the sensitivity of our predicted phase diagram to DFT
   approximations and convergence errors. We find two alloy configurations
   of the (4 x 3) structural prototype that are likely ground-state surface
   reconstructions, and simulated scanning tunneling micrographs (STM) of
   these reconstructions indicate that they can explain prominent features
   of experimentally obtained STM of the InAs/GaAs (4 Chi 3) surface.}},

Abstract = {{The sparse decomposition based on matching pursuit is an adaptive sparse
   expression of the signals. An adaptive matching pursuit algorithm that
   uses an impulse dictionary is introduced in this article for rolling
   bearing vibration signal processing and fault diagnosis. First, a new
   dictionary model is established according to the characteristics and
   mechanism of rolling bearing faults. The new model incorporates the
   rotational speed of the bearing,, the dimensions of the bearing and the
   bearing fault status, among other parameters. The model can simulate the
   impulse experienced by the bearing at different bearing fault levels. A
   simulation experiment suggests that a new impulse dictionary used in a
   matching pursuit algorithm combined with a genetic algorithm has a more
   accurate effect on bearing fault diagnosis than using a traditional
   impulse dictionary. However, those two methods have some weak points,
   namely, poor stability, rapidity and controllability. Each key parameter
   in the dictionary model and its influence on the analysis results are
   systematically studied, and the impulse location is determined as the
   primary model parameter. The adaptive impulse dictionary is established
   by changing characteristic parameters progressively. The dictionary
   built by this method has a lower redundancy and a higher relevance
   between each dictionary atom and the analyzed vibration signal. The
   matching pursuit algorithm of an adaptive impulse dictionary is adopted
   to analyze the simulated signals. The results indicate that the
   characteristic fault components could be accurately extracted from the
   noisy simulation fault signals by this algorithm, and the result
   exhibited a higher efficiency in addition to an improved stability,
   rapidity and controllability when compared with a matching pursuit
   approach that was based on a genetic algorithm. We experimentally
   analyze the early-stage fault signals and composite fault signals of the
   bearing. The results further demonstrate the effectiveness and
   superiority of the matching pursuit algorithm that uses the adaptive
   impulse dictionary. Finally, this algorithm is applied to the analysis
   of engineering data, and good results are achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Your brain on speed: cognitive performance of a spatial working memory
   task is not affected by walking speed}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{When humans walk in everyday life, they typically perform a range of
   cognitive tasks while they are on the move. Past studies examining
   performance changes in dual cognitive-motor tasks during walking have
   produced a variety of results. These discrepancies may be related to the
   type of cognitive task chosen, differences in the walking speeds
   studied, or lack of controlling for walking speed. The goal of this
   study was to determine how young, healthy subjects performed a spatial
   working memory task over a range of walking speeds. We used high-density
   electroencephalography to determine if electrocortical activity mirrored
   changes in cognitive performance across speeds. Subjects stood (0.0 m/s)
   and walked (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 m/s) with and without performing a
   Brooks spatial working memory task. We hypothesized that performance of
   the spatial working memory task and the associated electrocortical
   activity would decrease significantly with walking speed. Across speeds,
   the spatial working memory task caused subjects to step more widely
   compared with walking without the task. This is typically a sign that
   humans are adapting their gait dynamics to increase gait stability.
   Several cortical areas exhibited power fluctuations time-locked to
   memory encoding during the cognitive task. In the somatosensory
   association cortex, alpha power increased prior to stimulus presentation
   and decreased during memory encoding. There were small significant
   reductions in theta power in the right superior parietal lobule and the
   posterior cingulate cortex around memory encoding. However, the subjects
   did not show a significant change in cognitive task performance or
   electrocortical activity with walking speed. These findings indicate
   that in young, healthy subjects walking speed does not affect
   performance of a spatial working memory task. These subjects can devote
   adequate cortical resources to spatial cognition when needed, regardless
   of walking speed.}},

   we determined the efficacy of a finite element model (FEM) for
   predicting the mechanics of the labrum. The HH was oriented at 30 of
   glenohumeral abduction and neutral rotation with 50 N compressive force.
   Loads of 0 N or 22 N were applied to the LHBT. The HH was translated
   superiorly by 5 mm to simulate superior instability caused by Ras.
   Superior displacement of the labrum was affected by translation of the
   HH (P < 0.0001), position along the labrum (P < 0.0001), and interaction
   between the location on the labrum and LHBT tension (P < 0.05). The
   displacements predicted by the FEM were compared with mechanical tests
   from 6 cadaveric specimens and all were within 1 SD of the mean. A
   hyperelastic constitutive law for the labrum was a better predictor of
   labral behavior than the elastic law and insensitive to +/- 1 SD
   variations in material properties. Peak strains were observed at the
   glenoid labrum interface below the LHBT attachment consistent with the
   common location of labral pathology. These results suggest that
   pathomechanics of the shoulder secondary to Ras (e.g., superior HH
   translation) and LHBT loading play significant roles in the pathologic
   changes seen in the superior labrum. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{SDF-1 Enhances Wound Healing of Critical-Sized Calvarial Defects beyond
   Self-Repair Capacity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Host blood circulating stem cells are an important cell source that
   participates in the repair of damaged tissues. The clinical challenge is
   how to improve the recruitment of circulating stem cells into the local
   wound area and enhance tissue regeneration. Stromal-derived factor-1
   (SDF-1) has been shown to be a potent chemoattractant of blood
   circulating stem cells into the local wound microenvironment. In order
   to investigate effects of SDF-1 on bone development and the repair of a
   large bone defect beyond host self-repair capacity, the BMP-induced
   subcutaneous ectopic bone formation and calvarial critical-sized defect
   murine models were used in this preclinical study. A dose escalation of
   SDF-1 were loaded into collagen scaffolds containing BMP, VEGF, or PDGF,
   and implanted into subcutaneous sites at mouse dorsa or calvarial
   critical-sized bone defects for 2 and 4 weeks. The harvested biopsies
   were examined by microCT and histology. The results demonstrated that
   while SDF-1 had no effect in the ectopic bone model in promoting de novo
   osteogenesis, however, in the orthotopic bone model of the
   critical-sized defects, SDF-1 enhanced calvarial critical-sized bone
   defect healing similar to VEGF, and PDGF. These results suggest that
   SDF-1 plays a role in the repair of large critical-sized defect where
   more cells are needed while not impacting de novo bone formation, which
   may be associated with the functions of SDF-1 on circulating stem cell
   recruitment and angiogenesis.}},

   in response maps whose regimes are distinguished by the initial geometry

Abstract = {{This article presents the implementation of a calibration procedure for
   a finite element (FE) model of a state highway bridge using sensory data
   measured on the bridge. The objective is to modify the high-fidelity FE
   model of the bridge so that its dynamic behaviour matches, as closely as
   possible, that of the bridge under analysis. The bridge under
   investigation is a steel-concrete composite bridge that is instrumented
   with a wireless monitoring system to collect its vibration response
   under ambient vibrations. A detailed three-dimensional FE model of the
   bridge was developed to represent the bridge as realistically as
   possible. The detailed modelling can minimise the amount of uncertainty
   in the model and the number of parameters that require updating. A
   multi-variable sensitivity-based objective function is used to minimise
   the error between the experimentally measured and the FE-computed modal
   characteristics. An iterative optimisation approach has been undertaken
   to find the optimum structural parameters of the FE model that minimise
   the selected objective function. It is shown that developing a
   high-fidelity FE model may help simplify the model calibration process
   for a large structure, which is contrary to conventional thinking on the
   subject.}},

Abstract = {{Metamodel-based design optimisation is widely used to obtain a better
   design efficiently in a vehicle lightweight design. However, one of the
   major drawbacks of using metamodel in design optimisation is that the
   accuracy of any metamodel is inherently unpredictable, as the behaviours
   of vehicle performances are highly nonlinear and most metamodels do not
   consider the model uncertainty or discrepancy between physical
   experiments and computer model or metamodel. In this article, the bias
   function is used to statistically correct the model discrepancy, which
   is represented by a Gaussian process. A new metamodel method using
   Gaussian process based bias function is proposed to improve the accuracy
   of the metamodel. The proposed method is demonstrated through a
   mathematical example and examined by a vehicle crashworthiness design
   problem aiming at minimising the weight of front-end structure while
   satisfying the design target.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Accurate disease diagnosis, patient stratification and biomarker
   validation require the analysis of multiple biomarkers. This paper
   describes cross-reactivity-free multiplexing of enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) to
   confine detection antibodies at specific locations in fully aqueous
   environments. Antibody cross-reactions are eliminated because the
   detection antibody solutions are co-localized only to corresponding
   surface-immobilized capture antibody spots. This multiplexing technique
   is validated using plasma samples from allogeneic bone marrow
   recipients. Patients with acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), a
   common and serious condition associated with allogeneic bone marrow
   transplantation, display higher mean concentrations for four multiplexed
   biomarkers (HGF, elafin, ST2 and TNFR1) relative to healthy donors and
   transplant patients without GVHD. The antibody co-localization
   capability of this technology is particularly useful when using
   inherently cross-reactive reagents such as polyclonal antibodies,
   although monoclonal antibody cross-reactivity can also be reduced.
   Because ATPS-ELISA adapts readily available antibody reagents, plate
   materials and detection instruments, it should be easily transferable
   into other research and clinical settings.}},

Abstract = {{A critical challenge in biomedical imaging is to optimally balance the
   trade-off among image resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and acquisition
   time. Acquiring a high-resolution image is possible; however, it is
   either expensive or time consuming or both. Resolution is also limited
   by the physical properties of the imaging device, such as the nature and
   size of the input source radiation and the optics of the device.
   Super-resolution (SR), which is an off-line approach for improving the
   resolution of an image, is free of these trade-offs. Several
   methodologies, such as interpolation, frequency domain, regularization,
   and learning-based approaches, have been developed over the past several
   years for SR of natural images. We review some of these methods and
   demonstrate the positive impact expected from SR of retinal images and
   investigate the performance of various SR techniques. We use a fundus
   image as an example for simulations. (C) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical

Pages = {{1414-1436}},

Abstract = {{The classical Voorn-Overbeek thermodynamic theory of complexation and
   phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes is generalized
   to account for the charge accessibility and hydrophobicity of polyions,
   size of salt ions, and pH variations. Theoretical predictions of the
   effects of pH and salt concentration are compared with published
   experimental data and experiments we performed, on systems containing
   poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as the polyacid and poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl
   methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) or poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride)
   (PDADMAC) as the polybase. In general, the critical salt concentration
   below which the mixture phase separates, increases with degree of
   ionization and with the hydrophobicity of polyelectrolytes. We find
   experimentally that as the pH is decreased below 7, and PAA monomers are
   neutralized, the critical salt concentration increases, while the
   reverse occurs when pH is raised above 7. We predict this asymmetry
   theoretically by introducing a large positive Flory parameter (= 0.75)
   for the interaction of neutral PAA monomers with water. This large
   positive Flory parameter is supported by molecular dynamics simulations,
   which show much weaker hydrogen bonding between neutral PAA and water
   than between charged PAA and water, while neutral and charged PDMAEMA
   show similar numbers of hydrogen bonds. This increased hydrophobicity of
   neutral PAA at reduced pH increases the tendency towards phase
   separation despite the reduction in charge interactions between the
   polyelectrolytes. Water content and volume of coacervate are found to be
   a strong function of the pH and salt concentration.}},

   Strikes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Excavation related damage to underground utility lines is a serious and
   widespread problem. It is estimated that there are close to 500,000
   utility strikes in the United States every year. Further analysis
   reveals that this number equates to one utility struck every minute.
   Such utility line strikes lead to fatalities and injuries, costly
   service disruptions, fines and penalties, and heavy repair costs. The
   decade from 2001-2010 saw a total of 544 major excavation related
   accidents resulting in 37 fatalities, 152 injuries, and close to \$200
   million in property damage. Lack of accurate position and semantic data
   of buried utilities coupled with absence of persistent visual guidance
   are two key problems facing excavator operators. The third obstacle to
   safe excavation operations is the lack of real-time spatial awareness of
   the proximity of the digging implement to the underlying neighborhood
   utilities. In an attempt to alleviate this problem, the authors propose
   a real-time visual emulation framework to improve equipment operators'
   knowledge and spatial awareness during excavation. A computational
   framework that enables concurrent visualization of real jobsites using
   three-dimensional (3D) geographic information system models to represent
   terrain and subsurface utility infrastructure is presented. The proposed
   framework enables real-time operations monitoring and incorporates
   proximity sensing and collision detection algorithms, providing
   audio-visual warnings when safety thresholds are breached. This paper
   describes the details of the proposed damage prevention framework along
   with its implementation. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Superharmonic dynamics are characteristic of many nonlinear systems
   undergoing high levels of excitation. However, what constitutes high
   levels is relative to the system under study. For instance, bistable
   oscillators may have very low linearized natural frequency which often
   becomes a normalization parameter for excitation in analysis. Thus, high
   excitation levels may be a common operating condition for bistable
   oscillators. Recent experimental energy harvesting investigations using
   bistable devices (referred to as bistable energy harvesting) have
   observed superharmonic spectral and phenomenological effects yielding
   superior electrical power relative to that achieved by the fundamental
   harmonic. To provide a thorough analytical framework to probe the
   collective fundamental and superharmonic effects on bistable energy
   harvester power harvesting performance, this article employs the method
   of harmonic balance to predict the resulting electrodynamic responses
   applicable to piezoelectric and electromagnetic coupling configurations.
   The analytical results exemplify the relative ease by which significant
   superharmonic effects are activated and dominate spectral
   characteristics, potentially to greatly benefit energy harvesting. The
   conclusions are corroborated by trends observed in previously published
   investigations and are validated by present numerical results and
   experimental findings. This study provides new insights and suggests
   that careful understanding of excitation characteristics is needed for
   optimum bistable energy harvesting in practice.}},

Abstract = {{In thin film ferroelectric devices, switching of ferroelastic domains
   can significantly enhance electromechanical response. Previous studies
   have shown disagreement regarding the mobility or immobility of
   ferroelastic domain walls, indicating that switching behaviour strongly
   depends on specific microstructures in ferroelectric systems. Here we
   study the switching dynamics of individual ferroelastic domains in thin
   Pb(Zr-0.2, Ti-0.8)O-3 films under electrical and mechanical excitations
   by using in situ transmission electron microscopy and phase-field
   modelling. We find that ferroelastic domains can be effectively and
   permanently stabilized by dislocations at the substrate interface while
   similar domains at free surfaces without pinning dislocations can be
   removed by either electric or stress fields. For both electrical and
   mechanical switching, ferroelastic switching is found to occur most
   readily at the highly active needle points in ferroelastic domains. Our
   results provide new insights into the understanding of polarization
   switching dynamics as well as the engineering of ferroelectric devices.}},

Title = {{Terminal supraparticle assemblies from similarly charged protein

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Self-assembly of proteins and inorganic nanoparticles into terminal
   assemblies makes possible a large family of uniformly sized hybrid
   colloids. These particles can be compared in terms of utility,
   versatility and multifunctionality to other known types of terminal
   assemblies. They are simple to make and offer theoretical tools for
   designing their structure and function. To demonstrate such assemblies,
   we combine cadmium telluride nanoparticles with cytochrome C protein and
   observe spontaneous formation of spherical supraparticles with a narrow
   size distribution. Such self-limiting behaviour originates from the
   competition between electrostatic repulsion and non-covalent attractive
   interactions. Experimental variation of supraparticle diameters for
   several assembly conditions matches predictions obtained in simulations.
   Similar to micelles, supraparticles can incorporate other biological
   components as exemplified by incorporation of nitrate reductase. Tight
   packing of nanoscale components enables effective charge and exciton
   transport in supraparticles and bionic combination of properties as
   demonstrated by enzymatic nitrate reduction initiated by light
   absorption in the nanoparticle.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we examine the hydrodynamics of high-energy-density (HED)
   shear flows. Experiments, consisting of two materials of differing
   density, use the OMEGA-60 laser to drive a blast wave at a pressure of
   similar to 50 Mbar into one of the media, creating a shear flow in the
   resulting shocked system. The interface between the two materials is
   Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable, and a mixing layer of growing width develops
   due to the shear. To theoretically analyze the instability's behavior,
   we rely on two sources of information. First, the interface spectrum is
   well-characterized, which allows us to identify how the shock front and
   the subsequent shear in the post-shock flow interact with the interface.
   These observations provide direct evidence that vortex merger dominates
   the evolution of the interface structure. Second, simulations calibrated
   to the experiment allow us to estimate the time-dependent evolution of
   the deposition of vorticity at the interface. The overall result is that
   we are able to choose a hydrodynamic model for the system, and
   consequently examine how well the flow in this HED system corresponds to
   a classical hydrodynamic description. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A continuous-wave cavity ring-down spectroscopy sensor for real-time
   measurements of sputtered boron from Hall thrusters has been developed.
   The sensor uses a continuous-wave frequency-quadrupled diode laser at
   250 nm to probe ground state atomic boron sputtered from the boron
   nitride insulating channel. Validation results from a controlled setup
   using an ion beam and target showed good agreement with a simple
   finite-element model. Application of the sensor for measurements of two
   Hall thrusters, the H6 and SPT-70, is described. The H6 was tested at
   power levels ranging from 1.5 to 10 kW. Peak boron densities of 10 +/- 2
   x 10(14) m (3) were measured in the thruster plume, and the estimated
   eroded channel volume agreed within a factor of 2 of profilometry. The
   SPT-70 was tested at 600 and 660 W, yielding peak boron densities of 7.2
   +/- 1.1 x 10(14) m (3), and the estimated erosion rate agreed within
   similar to 20\% of profilometry. Technical challenges associated with
   operating a high-finesse cavity in the presence of energetic plasma are

   A Statistical S-Matrix Approach in Spectral Domain}},

Abstract = {{The problem of long distance wave propagation in a sparse random medium
   is considered in this paper. A mathematical technique for modeling the
   behavior of electromagnetic wave propagation as a function of distance
   in a 2-D sparse random media at millimeter wave (MMW) regime is
   presented. The proposed model is a field method based on Maxwell's
   equation and, thus, the phase and magnitude of the field in the random
   medium can be tracked accurately. The random media is characterized by
   low volume fraction but electrically large scatterers having relatively
   high dielectric constant. The technique relies on discretizing the
   random media into thin slabs and relating the forward and backward
   scattered plane wave spectra from the individual slabs by an equivalent
   spectral bistatic scattering matrix. By cascading the scattering
   matrices of the individual slabs, the statistics of the overall
   scattered wave in both forward and backward directions are obtained.
   This technique will be referred to as statistical S-matrix approach in
   spectral domain, or SSWaP-SD. Using this method, it is shown that after
   propagation to a critical range inside the random media, the incoherent
   component of the forward propagating wave overcomes the mean-field
   component resulting in a dual-slope attenuation curve as a function of
   distance. The accuracy of the model is examined against a full wave
   Monte Carlo simulation and a very good agreement is observed. Finally,
   based on the proposed model, analytical expressions for predicting the
   forward path-loss as well as the back scattered power from a sparse,
   translational invariant discrete random media are derived. The
   analytical expressions are tested against Monte Carlo simulation for a
   very long random medium and very good agreements are demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides hold promise for making
   ultrathin-film photovoltaic devices with a combination of excellent
   photovoltaic performance, superior flexibility, long lifetime, and low
   manufacturing cost. Engineering the proper band structures of such
   layered materials is essential to realize such potential. Here, we
   present a plasma-assisted doping approach for significantly improving
   the photovoltaic response in multilayer MoS2. In this work, we
   fabricated and characterized photovoltaic devices with a vertically
   stacked indium tin oxide electrode/ multilayer MoS2/metal electrode
   structure. Utilizing a plasma-induced p-doping approach, we are able to
   form p-n junctions in MoS2 layers that facilitate the collection of
   photogenerated carriers, enhance the photovoltages, and decrease reverse
   dark currents. Using plasma-assisted doping processes, we have
   demonstrated MoS2-based photovoltaic devices exhibiting very high
   short-circuit photocurrent density values up to 20.9 mA/cm(2) and
   reasonably good power-conversion efficiencies up to 2.8\% under AM1.5G
   illumination, as well as high external quantum efficiencies. We believe
   that this work provides important scientific Insights for leveraging the
   optoelectronic properties of emerging atomically layered two-dimensional
   materials for photovoltaic and other optoelectronlc applications.}},

Abstract = {{Extended command governors (ECGs) are add-on schemes that modify
   set-point commands as necessary to ensure that imposed state and control
   constraints are not violated by closed-loop systems designed for
   set-point tracking. In this paper, we propose a reduced order ECG for
   systems with dynamics decomposable into slow and fast state variables.
   We demonstrate that ECG implementation can be based on slow states only,
   thus reducing the computational complexity. This is achieved by
   introducing additional constraints, and by slightly tightening the
   original constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed ECG maintains the
   response properties of the conventional ECG, including the convergence
   to the nearest feasible command in finite time in the case of constant
   reference commands. The results are also shown to apply to conventional
   command governors. For the case when the reduced order state is not
   directly measured, a formulation of the result in the presence of a
   state observer is developed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The earliest-deadline-first (EDF) policy has been widely studied for the
   scheduling of real-time jobs for its effectiveness and simplicity.
   However, since each preemption incurs an additional delay to the
   execution of jobs, the effectiveness of EDF is affected greatly by the
   underlying preemption policy that determines if and when a
   higher-priority job is allowed to preempt a currently executing
   lower-priority job. To address this problem, we propose a new and better
   (in meeting job deadlines) preemption policy of EDF, given a non-zero
   preemption delay. Specifically, we propose a controlled preemption (CP)
   policy that controls the condition of preempting jobs, whereas existing
   approaches focus on that of preempted jobs. We define cp-EDF in which
   the CP policy is applied to EDF, and analyze its schedulability. This
   schedulability analysis is then utilized to develop an algorithm that
   assigns the optimal control parameters of cp-EDF. Our in-depth
   evaluation has demonstrated that cp-EDF with the optimal parameter
   assignment improves EDF schedulability over existing preemption policies
   by up to 7.4\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on building an efficient, online, and intelligent
   energy management controller to improve the fuel economy of a
   power-split plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). Based on a detailed
   powertrain analysis, the battery current can be optimized to improve the
   fuel economy using dynamic programming (DP). Three types of drive
   cycles, i.e., highway, urban, and urban (congested), are classified, and
   six typical drive cycles are analyzed and simulated to study all the
   driving conditions. The online intelligent energy management controller
   is built, which consists of two neural network (NN) modules that are
   trained based on the optimized results obtained by DP methods,
   considering the trip length and duration. Based on whether the trip
   length and duration are known or unknown, the controller will choose the
   corresponding NN module to output the effective battery current commands
   to realize the energy management. Numerical simulation shows that the
   proposed controller can improve the fuel economy of the vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an inductor-inductor-capacitor (LLC) resonant dc-dc
   converter design procedure for an onboard lithium-ion battery charger of
   a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is presented. Unlike
   traditional resistive load applications, the characteristic of a battery
   load is nonlinear and highly related to the charging profiles. Based on
   the features of an LLC converter and the characteristics of the charging
   profiles, the design considerations are studied thoroughly. The
   worst-case conditions for primary-side zero-voltage switching (ZVS)
   operation are analytically identified based on fundamental harmonic
   approximation when a constant maximum power (CMP) charging profile is
   implemented. Then, the worst-case operating point is used as the design
   targeted point to ensure soft-switching operation globally. To avoid the
   inaccuracy of fundamental harmonic approximation approach in the
   below-resonance region, the design constraints are derived based on a
   specific operation mode analysis. Finally, a step-by-step design
   methodology is proposed and validated through experiments on a prototype
   converting 400 V from the input to an output voltage range of 250-450 V
   at 3.3 kW with a peak efficiency of 98.2\%.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of electric drive vehicles (EDVs), the
   state-of-charge (SOC) estimation for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries has
   become increasingly more important. Based on the analysis of some of the
   most popular model-based SOC estimation methods, the
   proportional-integral (PI) observer is proposed to estimate the SOC of
   lithium-ion batteries in EDVs. The structure of the proposed PI observer
   is analyzed, and the convergence of the estimation method with model
   errors is verified. To demonstrate the superiority and compensation
   properties of the proposed PI observer, the simple-structure RC battery
   model is utilized to model the Li-ion battery. To validate the results
   of the proposed PI-based SOC estimation method, the experimental battery
   test bench is established. In the validation, the urban dynamometer
   driving schedule (UDDS) drive cycle is utilized, and the PI-based SOC
   estimation results are found to agree with the reference SOC, generally
   within the 2\% error band for both the known and unknown initial SOC
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{When multiple workspaces for resources are allocated within a narrow
   work area, the constructability of work may deteriorate based on the
   conflicts that occur due to the mutual adjacency levels between the
   workspaces. In this situation, the identification of the workspace
   overlapping status is essential for establishing the optimized layout
   planning of workspaces. However, current 3D environments consider only
   physical collision and reaction by the cross verification of geometric
   properties to detect collisions between 3D objects. Thus, the
   configuration of methodology to visually check the overlapping level of
   workspaces with conflicting status is insufficient for a successful
   interference management. This study develops a new grid cell-based
   analysis algorithm and its 4D simulation system for visually verifying
   the workspace overlapping of dynamic resources to be allocated multiply
   within a confined area, such as a tunnel or underground facility. The
   proposed algorithm and system can assist in the intensive management of
   activities that have a high level of workspace overlap by visualizing
   their overlapping level.}},

Abstract = {{Despite originating only a little more than a decade ago, click
   chemistry has become one of the most powerful paradigms in materials
   science, synthesis, and modification. By developing and implementing
   simple, robust chemistries that do not require difficult separations or
   harsh conditions, the ability to form, modify, and control the structure
   of materials on various length scales has become more broadly available
   to those in the materials science community. As such, click chemistry
   has seen broad implementation in polymer functionalization, surface
   modification, block copolymer and dendrimer synthesis, biomaterials
   fabrication, biofunctionalization, and in many other areas of materials
   science. Here, the basic reactions, approaches, and applications of
   click chemistry in materials science are highlighted, and a brief look
   is taken into the future enabling developments in this field.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results from the studies of the combustion
   performance of surrogate gasoline fuels in a Ricardo Hydra
   single-cylinder engine under homogeneous charge compression ignition
   (HCCI) conditions. The studies at fixed engine speed, intake air
   temperature, and intake manifold pressure (900 rpm, 200 degrees C, and
   1.8 bar, respectively) demonstrated that fuel chemistry, i.e., the
   chemical nature of the components and their concentration in the
   mixture, was strongly correlated to selected parameters of HCCI
   performance, such as thermal efficiency (eta(f)), combustion phasing
   (CA50), and maximum pressure rise rate (MPRR). Using a multivariate
   optimization method based on desirability functions, it was determined
   that optimal HCCI combustion performance would be obtained with mixtures
   rich in isooctane, methylcyclohexane, and toluene (about 30 vol \%
   each), with minimal content of n-heptane and 1-hexene (<10\%).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel non-contact broadband on-wafer S-parameter
   measurement technique for submillimeterwave and terahertz applications.
   The proposed method enables S-parameters measurement of multi-port
   micromachined devices using a two-port measurement setup. In this
   method, a small fraction of the signal at each waveguide port is weakly
   coupled to free space using a small array of reflection-canceling slots
   which are then measured by an open-ended waveguide probe. The
   S-parameters of the device-under-test are calculated fromthe measured
   signals obtained from each port and from that of a reference match
   waveguide. A broadband waveguide slot array antenna with high return
   loss is designed as a matched load to terminate all ports of the device
   except the input port. To assess the reliability and accuracy of the
   proposed measurement method, three different micromachined waveguide
   directional couplers are designed, fabricated, and tested. Multiple
   apertures on the common wall between the adjacent waveguides are
   designed and optimized to achieve high directivity couplers over a broad
   frequency range. The measured S-parameters of the couplers are shown to
   be in good agreement with the simulations, which indicates the accuracy
   of the proposed measurement method.}},

   Response Function Using a Truncated Fourier Series}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the exact relation between the real and imaginary
   parts of aerodynamic transfer functions for deriving impulse response
   functions that satisfy the causality condition. A truncated Fourier
   series is used to express the aerodynamic transfer functions, and the
   causality condition is defined in terms of the coefficients of a Fourier
   cosine and sine series, which represent the real and imaginary parts of
   the aerodynamic transfer functions, respectively. The impulse response
   functions that satisfy the causality condition are obtained through the
   inverse Fourier transform of the aerodynamic transfer functions that
   conform to the exact relation. The coefficients of the Fourier series
   are determined by minimizing the error between the transfer functions
   formed by measured flutter derivatives and by the Fourier series.
   Because the impulse response functions become a series of Dirac delta
   functions in the proposed method, the aerodynamic forces are easily
   evaluated as the sum of current and past displacements with the same
   number of the terms in the Fourier series. The validity of the proposed
   method is demonstrated for two types of bluff sections: a rectangular
   section with a width-to-depth ratio of 5 and an H-type section.
   Time-domain aeroelastic analyses are performed for an elastically
   supported system with each section. The proposed method yields stable
   and accurate solutions for the examples efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{In order to study the energy resolution degradation in 3D
   position-sensitive pixelated CdZnTe (CZT) detectors, a detailed detector
   system modeling package has been developed and used to analyze the
   detector performance. A 20 x 20 x 15 mm(3) CZT crystal with an 11 x 11
   simple-pixel anode array and a 1.72 mm pixel pitch was modeled. The VAS
   UM/TAT4 Application Specific Integrated Circuitry (ASIC) was used for
   signal read-out. Components of the simulation package include gamma-ray
   interactions with the CZT crystal, charge induction, electronic noise,
   pulse shaping, and ASIC triggering procedures. The charge induction
   model considers charge drift, trapping, diffusion, and sharing between
   pixels. This system model is used to determine the effects of electron
   cloud sharing, weighting potential non-uniformity, and weighting
   potential cross-talk which produce non-uniform signal responses for
   different gamma-ray interaction positions and ultimately degrade energy
   resolution. The effect of the decreased weighting potential underneath
   the gap between pixels on the total pulse amplitude of events has been
   studied. The transient signals induced by electron clouds collected near
   the gap between pixels may generate false signals, and the measured
   amplitude can be even greater than the photopeak. As the number of
   pixels that collect charge increases, the probability of side-neighbor
   events due to charge sharing significantly increases. If side-neighbor
   events are not corrected appropriately, the energy resolution of
   pixelated CZT detectors in multiple-pixel events degrades rapidly.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate a three-equation three-unknown dual-energy
   quantitative CT (DEQCT) technique for determining region specific
   variations in bone spongiosa composition for improved red marrow dose
   estimation in radionuclide therapy.
   Methods: The DEQCT method was applied to 80/140 kVp images of
   patient-simulating lumbar sectional body phantoms of three sizes (small,
   medium, and large). External calibration rods of bone, red marrow, and
   fat-simulating materials were placed beneath the body phantoms. Similar
   internal calibration inserts were placed at vertebral locations within
   the body phantoms. Six test inserts of known volume fractions of bone,
   fat, and red marrow were also scanned. External-to-internal calibration
   correction factors were derived. The effects of body phantom size,
   radiation dose, spongiosa region segmentation granularity {[}single
   (similar to 17 x 17 mm) region of interest (ROI), 2 x 2, and 3 x 3
   segmentation of that single ROI], and calibration method on the accuracy
   of the calculated volume fractions of red marrow (cellularity) and
   trabecular bone were evaluated.
   Results: For standard low dose DEQCT x-ray technique factors and the
   internal calibration method, the RMS errors of the estimated volume
   fractions of red marrow of the test inserts were 1.2-1.3 times greater
   in the medium body than in the small body phantom and 1.3-1.5 times
   greater in the large body than in the small body phantom. RMS errors of
   the calculated volume fractions of red marrow within 2 x 2 segmented
   subregions of the ROIs were 1.6-1.9 times greater than for no
   segmentation, and RMS errors for 3 x 3 segmented subregions were 2.3-2.7
   times greater than those for no segmentation. Increasing the dose by a
   factor of 2 reduced the RMS errors of all constituent volume fractions
   by an average factor of 1.40 +/- 0.29 for all segmentation schemes and
   body phantom sizes; increasing the dose by a factor of 4 reduced those
   RMS errors by an average factor of 1.71 +/- 0.25. Results for external
   calibrations exhibited much larger RMS errors than size matched internal
   calibration. Use of an average body size external-to-internal
   calibration correction factor reduced the errors to closer to those for
   internal calibration. RMS errors of less than 30\% or about 0.01 for the
   bone and 0.1 for the red marrow volume fractions would likely be
   satisfactory for human studies. Such accuracies were achieved for 3 x 3
   segmentation of 5 mm slice images for: (a) internal calibration with 4
   times dose for all size body phantoms, (b) internal calibration with 2
   times dose for the small and medium size body phantoms, and (c)
   corrected external calibration with 4 times dose and all size body
   phantoms.
   Conclusions: Phantom studies are promising and demonstrate the potential
   to use dual energy quantitative CT to estimate the spatial distributions
   of red marrow and bone within the vertebral spongiosa. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Multilayer donor regions in organic photovoltaics show improved power
   conversion efficiency when arranged in decreasing exciton energy order
   from the anode to the acceptor interface. These so-called ``energy
   cascades{''} drive exciton transfer from the anode to the dissociating
   interface while reducing exciton quenching and allowing improved overlap
   with the solar spectrum. Here we investigate the relative importance of
   exciton transfer and blocking in a donor cascade employing
   diphenyltetracene (D1), rubrene (D2), and
   tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (D3) whose optical gaps monotonically
   decrease from D1 to D3. In this structure, D1 blocks excitons from
   quenching at the anode, D2 accepts transfer of excitons from D1 and
   blocks excitons at the interface between D2 and D3, and D3 contributes
   the most to the photocurrent due to its strong absorption at visible
   wavelengths, while also determining the open circuit voltage. We observe
   singlet exciton Forster transfer from D1 to D2 to D3 consistent with
   cascade operation. The power conversion efficiency of the optimized
   cascade OPV with a C-60 acceptor layer is 7.1 +/- 0.4\%, which is
   significantly higher than bilayer devices made with only the individual
   donors. We develop a quantitative model to identify the dominant exciton
   processes that govern the photocurrent generation in multilayer organic
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Blood plays an important role in homeostatic regulation with each of its
   cellular components having important therapeutic and diagnostic uses.
   Therefore, separation and sorting of blood cells hasa been of a great
   interest to clinicians and researchers. However, while conventional
   methods of processing blood have been successful in generating
   relatively pure fractions, they are time consuming, labor intensive, and
   are not optimal for processing small volume blood samples. In recent
   years, microfluidics has garnered great interest from clinicians and
   researchers as a powerful technology for separating blood into different
   cell fractions. As microfluidics involves fluid manipulation at the
   microscale level, it has the potential for achieving high-resolution
   separation and sorting of blood cells down to a single-cell level, with
   an added benefit of integrating physical and biological methods for
   blood cell separation and analysis on the same single chip platform.
   This paper will first review the conventional methods of processing and
   sorting blood cells, followed by a discussion on how microfluidics is
   emerging as an efficient tool to rapidly change the field of blood cell
   sorting for blood-based therapeutic and diagnostic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Deer antlers are bony appendages that are annually cast and rapidly
   regrown in a seasonal process coupled to the reproductive cycle. Due to
   the uniqueness of this process among mammals, we reasoned that a
   fundamental characterization of antler progenitor cell behavior may
   provide insights that could lead to improved strategies for promoting
   bone repair. In this study, we investigated whether white-tailed deer
   antlerogenic progenitor cells (APC) conform to basic criteria defining
   mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). In addition, we tested the effects of
   the artificial glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) on osteogenic and
   chondrogenic differentiation as well as the degree of apoptosis during
   the latter. Comparisons were made to animal-matched marrow-derived MSC.
   APC and MSC generated similar numbers of colonies. APC cultures expanded
   less rapidly overall but experienced population recovery at later time
   points. In contrast to MSC, APC did not display adipogenic in vitro
   differentiation capacity. Under osteogenic culture conditions, APC and
   MSC exhibited different patterns of alkaline phosphatase activity over
   time. DEX increased APC alkaline phosphatase activity only initially but
   consistently led to decreased activity in MSC. APC and MSC in osteogenic
   culture underwent different time and DEX-dependent patterns of
   mineralization, yet APC and MSC achieved similar levels of mineral
   accrual in an ectopic ossicle model. During chondrogenic
   differentiation, APC exhibited high levels of apoptosis without a
   reduction in cell density. DEX decreased proteoglycan production and
   increased apoptosis in chondrogenic APC cultures but had the opposite
   effects in MSC. Our results suggest that APC and MSC proliferation and
   differentiation differ in their dependence on time, factors, and milieu.
   Antler tip APC may be more lineage-restricted osteo/chondroprogenitors
   with distinctly different responses to apoptotic and glucocorticoid
   stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{A method for designing transformation electromagnetics devices using
   tensor impedance surfaces is presented. The method is first applied to
   idealized tensor impedance boundary conditions (TIBCs), and later to
   printed-circuit tensor impedance surfaces (PCTISs). A PCTIS is a
   practical realization of a TIBC. It consists of a tensor impedance
   sheet, which models a subwave-length patterned metallic cladding, over a
   grounded dielectric substrate. The method outlined in this paper allows
   anisotropic TIBCs and PCTISs to be designed that support tangential wave
   vector distributions and power flow directions specified by a coordinate
   transformation. As an example, beam-shifting devices are designed, using
   TIBCs and PCTISs, that allow a surface wave to be shifted laterally. The
   designs are verified with a commercial full-wave electromagnetic solver.
   This work opens new opportunities for the design and implementation of
   anisotropic and inhomogeneous printed-circuit or graphene-based surfaces
   that can guide or radiate electromagnetic fields.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have therapeutic potential
   for dentin and dental pulp regeneration. For regenerative approaches to
   gain clinical acceptance, protocols are needed to determine feasible
   ways to store teeth, isolate DPSCs, and expand them to clinical scale
   numbers. Methods: In this study, 32 third molars were obtained from
   patients and immediately placed in saline or tissue culture medium
   followed by overnight storage at 4 C or immediate isolation of DPSCs.
   Upon isolation, cells were expanded in medium containing either fetal
   bovine serum (FBS) or human serum (HS). Cell proliferation (population
   doubling time {[}PDT], cell surface marker expression, and multi-potency
   were compared between DPSCs in FBS and DPSCs in HS. Results: The time
   frame of storage and storage medium did not affect the ability to
   isolate DPSCs. However, using HS instead of FBS in the initial isolation
   of DPSCs significantly decreased (P < .01) the isolation success rate
   from 89\% (FBS) to 23\% (HS). Yet, incorporating fibronectin in the DPSC
   initial isolation (using HS) significantly (P <. 01) increased the
   isolation success rate to 83\%. Interestingly, it was found that the
   proliferation rate was significantly (P < .05) higher for DPSCs in HS
   (PDT = 1.59 +/- 0.46) than that for DPSCs in FBS (PDT = 2.84 +/- 2.5).
   Finally, there was no difference in the expression of CD73, CD90, CD105,
   or multipotency (as measured by osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic
   differentiation) between DPSCs in FBS and DPSCs in HS. Conclusions:
   These findings show a clinically feasible method of storing third molars
   for the isolation of DPSCs. Additionally, DPSCs can be isolated and
   expanded to clinical scale numbers in media devoid of FBS and still
   maintain their phenotypic properties.}},

Title = {{A mesoscopic simulation method for predicting the rheology of

Abstract = {{We present a fast ``pointer{''} simulation method that extends the model
   of Cates and coworkers for the rheology of entangled wormlike micelles.
   Our method includes not only reptation, breakage/rejoining, contour
   length fluctuations, and Rouse modes, which were included in Cates'
   model, but also constraint release, bending modes, and a cross-over to
   the tight entanglement regime, which had not been previously considered.
   Our method also contains correlations in micelle length across multiple
   breakage/rejoining cycles, not included in previous approaches. Our
   method uses ``pointers{''} that track the ends of unrelaxed regions
   along each micelle, thereby allowing efficient simulations of relaxation
   dynamics for ensembles containing thousands of micelles, to obtain
   accurate results without preaveraging or neglecting correlations. A
   modified genetic algorithm is applied to transform the simulation data
   from the time to the frequency domain. The method can span several
   regimes of behavior depending on the relative rates of reptation,
   contour length fluctuations, breakage/rejoining, and high frequency
   modes and is suitable for predicting the rheological behavior of
   experimental solutions for wormlike micelles. This new simulation method
   allows extraction of multiple micellar parameters simultaneously by
   fitting experimental rheology data across the entire available frequency
   range. Values of average micelle length and breakage rate thereby
   obtained can be an order of magnitude different from previous estimates
   based on ``local{''} frequency dependencies predicted by Cates' model.
   These differences are due to more complete physics included in our
   method and the fitting of G ` and G `' data across the entire frequency
   range. We also provide quantitative relationships between these
   parameters and rheological behaviors that improve on previous simple
   scaling results. (C) 2014 The Society of Rheology.}},

Abstract = {{We have performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous
   solutions of model oligomers of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and
   hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) excipients
   interacting with a representative poorly soluble active pharmaceutical
   ingredient (API), phenytoin. Simulations reveal formation of
   excipient-API complexes for some of the oligomers, which results in a
   reduction of API aggregation. API aggregation and diffusivity decreased
   with an increase in excipient content. Excipients form a ``gel-like{''}
   phase spanning the simulation box beyond similar to 10 wt \%; API
   diffusivity within this gel phase is much smaller than API diffusivity
   without excipient, and decreases exponentially, by 5 orders of
   magnitude, with increased polymer concentration. Substantial differences
   are observed with variations in methyl, hydroxypropyl, acetate, and
   succinate substitution levels in the model oligomers and with the
   deprotonation state of succinate groups, with strongest interactions
   with hydrophobic phenytoin observed in the case of acetate substitution.
   These are used to develop quantitative measures of excipient-API
   interactions and excipient efficiency in the inhibition of API
   aggregation. We also find that for model oligomers based on Methocel E
   (manufactured by Dow Pharma \& Food Solutions) chemistry, oligomers of
   length 10 monomers and simulation boxes of size 7 nm give results
   similar to those for longer oligomers and bigger boxes. The quantitative
   measures developed in this study are expected to prove useful as
   computational screening tools in excipient design.}},

Abstract = {{Multivalent conjugation of folic acid has been employed to target cells
   overexpressing folate receptors. Such polymer conjugates have been
   previously demonstrated to have high avidity to folate binding protein.
   However, the lack of a monovalent folic acid-polymer material has
   prevented a full binding analysis of these conjugates, as multivalent
   binding mechanisms and polymer-mass mechanisms are convoluted in samples
   with broad distributions of folic acid-to-dendrimer ratios. In this
   work, the synthesis of a monovalent folic acid-dendrimer conjugate
   allowed the elucidation of the mechanism for increased binding between
   the folic acid-polymer conjugate and a folate binding protein surface.
   The increased avidity is due to a folate-keyed interaction between the
   dendrimer and protein surfaces that fits into the general framework of
   slow-onset, tight-binding mechanisms of ligand/protein interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Fission track (FT) thermochornology is essentially based on empirical
   fits to annealing data of FTs revealed by chemical etching, because,
   until now, unetched, latent FTs could not be examined analytically at
   the atomic-scale. The major challenge to such an analysis has been the
   random orientation of FTs and their extremely small diameters. Here we
   use high-energy ions (2.2 GeV Au or 80 MeV Xe) to simulate FT formation
   along specific crystallographic orientations. By combining results from
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of single tracks and small-angle
   X-ray scattering (SAXS) for millions of tracks, a precise picture of
   track morphology as a function of orientation is obtained.
   High-resolution analysis reveals that orientation affects the shape of
   tracks in apatite and zircon through the preferential creation of damage
   along directions with highest atomic density. However, track radius does
   not depend on orientation, contradicting previous reports. Independent
   of track orientation, track radii, as measured at each point along the
   entire length of 80 MeV Xe ion tracks in apatite, can be understood
   using the thermal spike model of Szenes. Thus, the well-known track
   annealing anisotropy of apatite is not due to track radius anisotropy.
   The combination of ion-irradiations with TEM and SAXS analysis provides
   a unique opportunity to understand and model track formation and
   annealing under various geologic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an energy-efficient feature extraction accelerator
   design aimed at visual navigation. The hardware-oriented algorithmic
   modifications such as a circular-shaped sampling region and unified
   description are proposed to minimize area and energy consumption while
   maintaining feature extraction quality. A matched-throughput accelerator
   employs fully-unrolled filters and single-stream descriptor enabled by
   algorithm-architecture co-optimization, which requires lower clock
   frequency for the given throughput requirement and reduces hardware cost
   of description processing elements. Due to the large number of FIFO
   blocks, a robust low-power FIFO architecture for the ultra-low voltage
   (ULV) regime is also proposed. This approach leverages shift-latch delay
   elements and balanced-leakage readout technique to achieve 62\% energy
   savings and 37\% delay reduction. We apply these techniques to a feature
   extraction accelerator that can process 30 fps VGA video in real time
   and is fabricated in 28 nm LP CMOS technology. The design consumes 2.7
   mW with a clock frequency of 27 MHz at V-dd = 470 mV, providing 3.5x
   better energy efficiency than previous state-of-the-art while extracting
   features from entire image.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The authors report on Langmuir probe measurements that show that
   hydrocarbon surfaces in contact with Ar plasma cause changes of electron
   energy distribution functions due to the flux of hydrogen and carbon
   atoms released by the surfaces. The authors compare the impact on plasma
   properties of hydrocarbon species gasified from an etching hydrocarbon
   surface with injection of gaseous hydrocarbons into Ar plasma. They find
   that both kinds of hydrocarbon injections decrease electron density and
   slightly increase electron temperatures of low pressure Ar plasma. For
   low percentages of impurities (similar to 1\% impurity in Ar plasma
   explored here), surface-derived hydrocarbon species and gas phase
   injected hydrocarbon molecules cause similar changes of plasma
   properties for the same number of hydrocarbon molecules injected into Ar
   with a decrease in electron density of similar to 4\%. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Crystalline-to-crystalline phase transformation of cubic Gd2O3 induced
   by swift Au ions with a kinetic energy of 2.25 GeV, has been
   characterized by synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments (XRD) as a
   function of increasing fluence, up to 5 x 10(13) ions/cm(2). The
   diffraction maxima of the initial cubic structure gradually decrease in
   intensity as function of ion fluence, concurrent with the in-growth of
   several new diffraction peaks, which, based on Rietveld refinement,
   correspond to the monoclinic high-temperature phase. The same
   cubic-to-monoclinic phase transformation induced by swift heavy ions has
   been observed in Y2O3. The transformation pathway under irradiation is
   consistent with the high-temperature behavior of Gd2O3, and is probably
   associated with a multiple ion-impact mechanism. There was no evidence
   of amorphous material in the diffraction patterns, even after
   irradiation to the maximum fluence, at which the initial cubic phase has
   been completely transformed to the monoclinic structure. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Polycrystalline La2Ti2O7 powders have been irradiated with 2.0 GeV
   Ta-181 ions up to a fluence of 1 x 10(13) ions/cm(2). Radiation-induced
   structural modifications were analyzed using synchrotron-based X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), Raman
   spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). An increase in
   the amorphous fraction as a function of fluence was revealed by XRD and
   Raman analyses and is evidenced by the reduction in intensity of the
   sharp Bragg maxima from the crystalline regions. Concurrently,
   diffraction maxima and vibrational absorption bands broaden with the
   increasing amorphous fraction. The cross-section for the
   crystalline-to-amorphous transformation (ion tracks) was determined by
   quantitative analysis of XRD patterns yielding a track diameter of d =
   7.2 +/- 0.9 nm. Slightly larger track diameters were obtained directly
   from TEM images (d = 10.6 +/- 0.8 nm) and SAXS analysis (d = 10.6 +/- 03
   nm). High-resolution TEM images revealed that single tracks are entirely
   amorphous without any outer crystalline, disordered shell as found in
   pyrochlore oxides of the same stoichiometry. The large ratio of ionic
   radii of the A- and B-site cations (r(A)/r(B) = 1.94) means that
   disordering over the A- and B-sites is energetically unfavorable. (C)

   crystals were irradiated with 2.2 GeV Au-197 ions. Ion track formation
   was investigated using synchrotron based small angle X-ray scattering
   (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cylindrical ion
   tracks consisted of an amorphous core with sharp boundaries within the
   crystalline matrix. The SAXS results, modelled as long cylindrical
   tracks, provided a constant track density that is 0.6 +/- 0.3\%
   different to that of the surrounding matrix. The average track radii
   determined by both techniques were in excellent agreement, 4.4 +/- 0.1
   nm from SAXS and 4.4 +/- 0.5 nm from TEM. A comparison with previous
   results of ion tracks in YAG indicates that the track radius is not
   affected by the presence of 1 mol\% Nd dopant. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Polycrystalline ThO2 was irradiated with 2.2 GeV Au ions and
   characterized by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The diffraction measurements
   indicated an increase in the unit cell parameter and the accumulation of
   heterogeneous microstrain with increasing ion fluence, both of which are
   consistent with a single-impact model of damage accumulation. An
   analytical fit of the data to a single-impact model yielded a saturation
   unit cell expansion of 0.049 +/- 0.002\% and a saturation strain of 10.4
   +/- 0.2\%. Cross-section data determined from the model values yielded
   effective ion track diameters of 1.9 +/- 0.2 nm and 3.2 +/- 0.3 nm for
   the two modifications, respectively, indicating that the tracks consist
   of a core region in which swelling and strain have occurred and a
   defect-rich halo in which microstrain is present but the initial unit
   cell parameter has not changed significantly. The spectroscopic analysis
   revealed the presence of significant local structural distortion in the
   irradiated material, but no evidence of systematic modification to the
   electronic state or chemical environment of the cations. This indicates
   that swift heavy ion irradiation of ThO2 primarily produces simple point
   defects or defect agglomerates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A minority of methanotrophs are able to utilize multicarbon compounds as
   growth substrates in addition to methane. The pathways utilized by these
   microorganisms for assimilation of multicarbon compounds, however, have
   not been explicitly examined. Here, we report the draft genome of the
   facultative methanotroph Methylocystis sp. strain SB2 and perform a
   detailed transcriptomic analysis of cultures grown with either methane
   or ethanol. Evidence for use of the canonical methane oxidation pathway
   and the serine cycle for carbon assimilation from methane was obtained,
   as well as for operation of the complete tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
   and the ethylmalonyl-coenzyme A (EMC) pathway. Experiments with
   Methylocystis sp. strain SB2 grown on methane revealed that genes
   responsible for the first step of methane oxidation, the conversion of
   methane to methanol, were expressed at a significantly higher level than
   those for downstream oxidative transformations, suggesting that this
   step may be rate limiting for growth of this strain with methane.
   Further, transcriptomic analyses of Methylocystis sp. strain SB2 grown
   with ethanol compared to methane revealed that on ethanol (i) expression
   of the pathway of methane oxidation and the serine cycle was
   significantly reduced, (ii) expression of the TCA cycle dramatically
   increased, and (iii) expression of the EMC pathway was similar. Based on
   these data, it appears that Methylocystis sp. strain SB2 converts
   ethanol to acetyl-coenzyme A, which is then funneled into the TCA cycle
   for energy generation or incorporated into biomass via the EMC pathway.
   This suggests that some methanotrophs have greater metabolic flexibility
   than previously thought and that operation of multiple pathways in these
   microorganisms is highly controlled and integrated.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Readmissions after radical cystectomy are common, burdensome, and poorly
   understood. For these reasons, the authors conducted a population-based
   study that focused on the causes of and time to readmission after
   radical cystectomy.
   METHODS
   Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data, at
   total of 1782 patients who underwent radical cystectomy from 2003
   through 2009 were identified. A piecewise exponential model was used to
   examine reasons for readmission as well as patient and clinical factors
   associated with the timing of readmission.
   RESULTS
   One in 4 patients (25.5\%) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge
   after radical cystectomy. Compared with patients without readmission,
   those readmitted were similar with regard to age, sex, and race.
   Readmitted patients had more complications (33.8\% vs 13.9\%; P < .001)
   and were more likely to have been discharged to skilled nursing
   facilities from their index admission (P < .001). The average time to
   readmission and subsequent length of stay were 11.5 days and 6.7 days,
   respectively. The majority of readmissions (67.4\%) occurred within 2
   weeks of discharge, 66.8\% had emergency department charges, and 25.9\%
   involved intensive care unit use. Although the spectrum of reasons for
   readmission varied over the 4 weeks after discharge, the most common
   included infection (51.4\%), failure to thrive (36.3\%), and urinary
   (33.2\%) and gastrointestinal (23.1\%) etiologies; 95.8\% of patients
   had >= 1 of these diagnosis groups present at the time of readmission.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Readmissions after radical cystectomy are common and time-dependent.
   Interventions to prevent and reduce the readmission burden after
   cystectomy likely need to focus on the first 2 weeks after discharge,
   take into consideration the spectrum of reasons for readmission, and
   target high-risk individuals. Cancer 2014;120:1409-1416. (c) 2014

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The exponential growth of available information and the deployment of
   knowledge management systems delivers excessive information to the end
   users that they cannot manage at once. This problem has led to an
   increased emphasis on solutions to information overload. Searching and
   browsing are two methods to locate information. Many studies have
   focused on solving the information overload problem in the searching
   process, but the methods to alleviate information overload in browsing
   process have not been adequately studied. Hence, a method that addresses
   information overload in the browsing process is presented in this paper.
   The aim is to reduce the information overload during browsing domain
   knowledge for new knowledge users who have little understanding of the
   information. In this method, a knowledge map and social network analysis
   are utilized to navigate the knowledge users. Technologies first
   construct a knowledge map from text mining and the important knowledge
   that includes more information about the domain is then identified via
   social network analysis. Based on this process, the knowledge user can
   browse the domain knowledge starting from the important knowledge and
   navigate via the knowledge map. We applied the method to assist new
   knowledge users in browsing the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) domain
   knowledge base to validate the method. The results indicate that the
   method can identify the important knowledge at a highly acceptable
   level, the constructed knowledge map can efficiently navigate the
   knowledge users, and the information overload can be significantly
   decreased. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an approach for driver-aware vehicle control based
   on stochastic model predictive control with learning (SMPCL). The
   framework combines the on-board learning of a Markov chain that
   represents the driver behavior, a scenario-based approach for stochastic
   optimization, and quadratic programming. By using quadratic programming,
   SMPCL can handle, in general, larger state dimension models than
   stochastic dynamic programming, and can reconfigure in real-time for
   accommodating changes in driver behavior. The SMPCL approach is
   demonstrated in the energy management of a series hybrid electrical
   vehicle, aimed at improving fuel efficiency while enforcing constraints
   on battery state of charge and power. The SMPCL controller allocates the
   power from the battery and the engine to meet the driver power request.
   A Markov chain that models the power request dynamics is learned in
   real-time to improve the prediction capabilities of model predictive
   control (MPC). Because of exploiting the learned pattern of the driver
   behavior, the proposed approach outperforms conventional model
   predictive control and shows performance close to MPC with full
   knowledge of future driver power request in standard and real-world
   driving cycles.}},

Abstract = {{The cyclic variability (CV) at late phasing conditions in autoignition
   engines with high residuals limits the operating range of such advanced
   combustion strategies. A model has been recently proposed by the authors
   that captures the experimental observations of CV in lean autoignition
   combustion in a single-cylinder engine. The model is here tuned to
   multicylinder engine data and is used to design controllers that reduce
   the CV. The dynamics are only stable for certain amounts of residual
   gas. At late phasing, with low amounts of residual gas, a cascade of
   period-doubling bifurcations occur leading to seemingly chaotic
   behavior. The deterministic dynamics are also mixed with significant
   levels of noise in the residual gas fraction. The approach to reduce CV
   is to control the fuel injection timing, which is an effective way of
   influencing the combustion phasing in the individual cylinders, with
   feedback from the combustion phasing. A PI controller and a
   reduced-order linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller are designed
   and evaluated in experiments. Integral action is utilized for
   maintaining the average combustion phasing between open loop and closed
   loop, which is shown to be essential for a proper evaluation because of
   the high sensitivity of CV on the combustion phasing close to unstable
   operation. A quantitative analysis of the experimental results show that
   CV is notably reduced for various levels of residual gas fraction at one
   speed and load. The standard deviation of the combustion phasing is
   reduced by 17\% on average over the open-loop behavior, which results in
   a 15\% smaller coefficient of variation of the indicated work.}},

Abstract = {{The truncated singular value decomposition of the measurement matrix is
   the optimal solution to the representation problem of how to best
   approximate a noisy measurement matrix using a low-rank matrix. Here, we
   consider the (unobservable) denoising problem of how to best approximate
   a low-rank signal matrix buried in noise by optimal (re)weighting of the
   singular vectors of the measurement matrix. We exploit recent results
   from random matrix theory to exactly characterize the large matrix limit
   of the optimal weighting coefficients and show that they can be computed
   directly from data for a large class of noise models that includes the
   independent identically distributed Gaussian noise case. Our analysis
   brings into sharp focus the shrinkage-and-thresholding form of the
   optimal weights, the nonconvex nature of the associated shrinkage
   function (on the singular values), and explains why matrix
   regularization via singular value thresholding with convex penalty
   functions (such as the nuclear norm) will always be suboptimal. We
   validate our theoretical predictions with numerical simulations, develop
   an implementable algorithm (OptShrink) that realizes the predicted
   performance gains and show how our methods can be used to improve
   estimation in the setting where the measured matrix has missing entries.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1287-1295}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Demand response programs incentivize loads to actively moderate their
   energy consumption to aid the power system. Uncertainty is an intrinsic
   aspect of demand response because a load's capability is often unknown
   until the load has been deployed. Algorithms must therefore balance
   utilizing well-characterized, good loads and learning about poorly
   characterized but potentially good loads; this is a manifestation of the
   classical tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. We address this
   tradeoff in a restless bandit framework, a generalization of the
   well-known multi-armed bandit problem. The formulation yields index
   policies in which loads are ranked by a scalar index, and those with the
   highest are deployed. The policy is particularly appropriate for demand
   response because the indices have explicit analytical expressions that
   may be evaluated separately for each load, making them both simple and
   scalable. This formulation serves as a heuristic basis for when only the
   aggregate effect of demand response is observed, from which the state of
   each individual load must be inferred. We formulate a tractable,
   analytical approximation for individual state inference based on
   observations of aggregate load curtailments. In numerical examples, the
   restless bandit policy outperforms the greedy policy by 5\%-10\% of the
   total cost. When the states of deployed loads are inferred from
   aggregate measurements, the resulting performance degradation is on the
   order of a few percent for the (now heuristic) restless bandit policy.}},

   sun sensing, for which the covariance of the sun vector estimate is
   derived as a function of the photodiode configuration. The measured sun
   vector angular accuracy is then minimized as a function of the
   configuration, which enables the most accurate sun sensing with the
   given hardware. This technique maximizes subsystem performance and
   provides a design method to replace traditional, iterative design
   approaches to sensor placement.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of different diluent gases (He, Ar, N-2, CH4, and CH4

   with He over all catalysts. CH4 enhanced C2H4 conversion while He
   provided both high EO selectivity and yield. Thus, the 35\% CH4 balanced
   with 53\% He diluent gas provided the highest synergistic effect toward

Abstract = {{PurposeRegularizing parallel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   reconstruction significantly improves image quality but requires tuning
   parameter selection. We propose a Monte Carlo method for automatic
   parameter selection based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate that
   minimizes the multichannel k-space mean squared error (MSE). We
   automatically tune parameters for image reconstruction methods that
   preserve the undersampled acquired data, which cannot be accomplished
   using existing techniques.
   TheoryWe derive a weighted MSE criterion appropriate for data-preserving
   regularized parallel imaging reconstruction and the corresponding
   weighted Stein's unbiased risk estimate. We describe a Monte Carlo
   approximation of the weighted Stein's unbiased risk estimate that uses
   two evaluations of the reconstruction method per candidate parameter
   value.
   MethodsWe reconstruct images using the denoising sparse images from
   GRAPPA using the nullspace method (DESIGN) and L-1 iterative
   self-consistent parallel imaging (L-1-SPIRiT). We validate Monte Carlo
   Stein's unbiased risk estimate against the weighted MSE. We select the
   regularization parameter using these methods for various noise levels
   and undersampling factors and compare the results to those using
   MSE-optimal parameters.
   ResultsOur method selects nearly MSE-optimal regularization parameters
   for both DESIGN and L-1-SPIRiT over a range of noise levels and
   undersampling factors.
   ConclusionThe proposed method automatically provides nearly MSE-optimal
   choices of regularization parameters for data-preserving nonlinear
   parallel MRI reconstruction methods. Magn Reson Med 71:1760-1770, 2014.

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{47-59}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Directional solidification via the liquid metal cooling process results
   in refined microstructure and reduced defects, thus providing improved
   mechanical performance of single crystal (SX) materials. However, the
   enhanced heat extraction inherent to the process results in a curved
   solidification front that may lead to non-axial growth of dendrites near
   the casting walls. The mechanism by which the lateral growth occurs has
   been investigated by microstructure modeling via solute-adjusted,
   diffusional growth of dendrites. Local thermal profiles derived from
   continuum solidification models were used as inputs to a dendrite-growth
   model capable of simulations in both two and three dimensions. A finite
   difference calculation of the diffusion field and volume of fluid
   tracking for the growth of the dendrite front was coupled to predict the
   microstructure evolution during directional solidification. Model
   predictions were compared to experimentally observed dendritic
   structures. In addition, a parametric analysis was conducted to evaluate
   the sensitivity of the dendrite-growth mode to changes in thermal,
   structural (such as dendrite position and spacing) and model parameters.
   The inclination angle of the solidification front strongly influenced
   the evolution of dendritic structure. The degree of misorientation of
   the < 0 0 1 > SX orientation from the withdrawal axis significantly
   contributed to the onset of lateral dendritic growth. Published by

Abstract = {{Aeroelastic systems achieve the best performance when the aerodynamic
   shape and structural sizing are optimized concurrently, but such an
   optimization is challenging when high-fidelity aerodynamic and
   structural models are required. This paper addresses this challenge
   through several significant improvements. Fully coupled Newton-Krylov
   methods are presented for the solution of aerostructural systems and for
   the corresponding adjoint systems. The coupled adjoint method presented
   can compute gradients with respect to thousands of multidisciplinary
   design variables accurately and efficiently. This is enabled by several
   improvements in the computation of the multidisciplinary terms in the
   coupled adjoint. The parallel scalability of the methods is demonstrated
   for a full aircraft configuration using an Euler computational fluid
   dynamics model with more than 8x106 state variables and a detailed
   structural finite element model of the wing with more than 1x106 degrees
   of freedom. The coupled Newton-Krylov methods are shown to improve the
   convergence rate of both the aerostructural solution and the coupled
   adjoint derivative computations. Gradient computations of aerodynamic
   and structural functions with respect to both aerodynamic shape and
   structural sizing variables are verified, and scaling is demonstrated to
   O(103) variables. The accuracy and scalability of the presented methods
   make it possible to perform aerostructural optimizations of full
   aircraft configurations with respect to hundreds of external shape and
   structural sizing design variables, leading to optimal aeroelastic
   tailoring.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, force and particle-image-velocimetry vorticity
   measurements of biologically inspired hover kinematics are compared to
   corresponding results of an unsteady aerodynamic vortex model and a
   Navier-Stokes (NS) solver. The Reynolds number and the reduced frequency
   are 4.8x103 and 0.38, respectively. Three kinematics derived from the
   measured hovering kinematics of an Agrius convolvuli are considered:
   1)without elevation angle, 2)elevation angle accounted in the pitch
   angle, and 3)pure sinusoidal pitch-plunge neglecting higher harmonics.
   The Navier-Stokes computations show good qualitative agreement with
   experiments with consistent underprediction. The time-averaged thrust
   coefficients obtained using Navier-Stokes computations are 82 to 87\% of
   the corresponding force measurements. The standard deviation of time
   history of thrust coefficients, also normalized by the measured
   time-averaged values, is 13 to 20\%. The underprediction is possibly due
   to blockage effects in the experiments, also reflected in lower values
   of the vorticity compared to particle-image-velocimetry measurements.
   The unsteady aerodynamic vortex model captures some of the peaks in a
   qualitative manner. The relative difference in the time-averaged forces
   and standard deviation are 8 to 18\% and 66 to 93\%, respectively. The
   differences in prediction of time histories are not reflected in the
   estimation of time-averaged forces due to cancellation effects, wherein
   the forces are underpredicted in the first half of the stroke and
   overpredicted in the second half. The discrepancies are attributed to
   the simplifying assumptions in the unsteady aerodynamic vortex model,
   which overpredicts the vorticity in the leading-edge vortex and results
   in significant differences in the wing-wake interaction process.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Iterative learning control (ILC) is a 2-degree-of-freedom technique that
   seeks to improve system performance along the time and iteration
   domains. Traditionally, ILC has been implemented to minimize
   trajectory-tracking errors across an entire cycle period. However, there
   are applications in which the necessity for improved tracking
   performance can be limited to a few specific locations. For such
   systems, a modified learning controller focused on improved tracking at
   the selected points can be leveraged to address multiple performance
   metrics, resulting in systems that exhibit significantly improved
   behaviors across a wide variety of performance metrics. This paper
   presents a pareto learning control framework that incorporates multiple
   objectives into a single design architecture. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVEWhile metformin is generally accepted as the first-line agent
   in treatment of type 2 diabetes, there are insufficient evidence and
   extensive debate about the best second-line agent. We aimed to assess
   the benefits and harms of four commonly used antihyperglycemia treatment
   regimens considering clinical effectiveness, quality of life, and
   cost.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe developed and validated a new
   population-based glycemic control Markov model that simulates natural
   variation in HbA(1c) progression. The model was calibrated using a U.S.
   data set of privately insured individuals diagnosed with type 2
   diabetes. We compared treatment intensification of metformin monotherapy
   with sulfonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, glucagon-like
   peptide-1 receptor agonist, or insulin. Outcome measures included
   life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), mean time to
   insulin dependence, and expected medication cost per QALY from diagnosis
   to first diabetes complication (ischemic heart disease, myocardial
   infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, blindness, renal failure,
   amputation) or death.RESULTSAccording to our model, all regimens
   resulted in similar LYs and QALYs regardless of glycemic control goal,
   but the regimen with sulfonylurea incurred significantly lower cost per
   QALY and resulted in the longest time to insulin dependence. An HbA(1c)
   goal of 7\% (53 mmol/mol) produced higher QALYs compared with a goal of
   8\% (64 mmol/mol) for all regimens.CONCLUSIONSUse of sulfonylurea as
   second-line therapy for type 2 diabetes generated glycemic control and
   QALYs comparable with those associated with other agents but at lower
   cost. A model that incorporates HbA(1c) and diabetes complications can
   serve as a useful clinical decision tool for selection of treatment
   options.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Much of current research in electrochemical energy storage is devoted to
   new electrode chemistries and reaction mechanisms that promise
   substantial increases in energy density. Unfortunately, most high
   capacity electrodes exhibit an unacceptably large hysteresis in their
   voltage profile. Using a first-principles multi-scale approach to
   examine particle level dynamics, we identify intrinsic thermodynamic and
   kinetic properties that are responsible for the large hysteresis
   exhibited by many high capacity electrodes. Our analysis shows that the
   hysteresis in the voltage profile of high capacity electrodes that rely
   on displacement reactions arises from a difference in reaction paths
   between charge and discharge. We demonstrate that different reaction
   paths are followed (i) when there is a large mismatch in ionic
   mobilities between the electrochemically active species (e.g. Li) and
   displaced ionic species and (ii) when there is a lack of a thermodynamic
   driving force to redistribute displaced ions upon charging of the
   electrode. These insights motivate the formulation of design metrics for
   displacement reactions in terms of fundamental properties determined by
   the chemistry and crystallography of the electrode material, properties
   that are now readily accessible with first-principles computation.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Support vector regression for approximating nonlinear dynamic systems is
   more delicate than the approximation of indicator functions in support
   vector classification, particularly for systems that involve multitudes
   of time scales in their sampled data. The kernel used for support vector
   learning determines the class of functions from which a support vector
   machine can draw its solution, and the choice of kernel significantly
   influences the performance of a support vector machine. In this paper,
   to bridge the gap between wavelet multiresolution analysis and kernel
   learning, the closed-form orthogonal wavelet is exploited to construct
   new multiscale asymmetric orthogonal wavelet kernels for linear
   programming support vector learning. The closed-form multiscale
   orthogonal wavelet kernel provides a systematic framework to implement
   multiscale kernel learning via dyadic dilations and also enables us to
   represent complex nonlinear dynamics effectively. To demonstrate the
   superiority of the proposed multiscale wavelet kernel in identifying
   complex nonlinear dynamic systems, two case studies are presented that
   aim at building parallel models on benchmark datasets. The development
   of parallel models that address the long-term/mid-term prediction issue
   is more intricate and challenging than the identification of
   series-parallel models where only one-step ahead prediction is required.
   Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   multiscale kernel learning.}},

Abstract = {{While tasks may be preemptive or non-preemptive (due to their
   transactional operations), deadline guarantees in multi-core systems
   have been made only for those task sets in each of which all tasks are
   preemptive or non-preemptive, not a mixture thereof, i.e., fully
   preemptive or fully non-preemptive. In this paper, we first develop a
   schedulability analysis framework that guarantees the timing
   requirements of a given task set in which a task can be either
   preemptive or non-preemptive in multi-core systems. We then apply this
   framework to the prioritization polices of EDF (earliest deadline first)
   and FP (fixed priority), yielding schedulability tests of mpn-EDF (Mixed
   Preemptive/Non-preemptive EDF) and mpn-FP, which are generalizations of
   corresponding fully-preemptive and non-preemptive algorithms, i.e.,
   fp-EDF and np-EDF, and fp-FP and np-FP. In addition to their timing
   guarantees for any task set that consists of a mixture of preemptive and
   non-preemptive tasks, the tests outperform the existing schedulability
   tests of np-EDF and np-FP (i.e., special cases of mpn-EDF and mpn-FP).
   Using these tests, we also improve schedulability by developing an
   algorithm that optimally disallows preemption of a preemptive task under
   a certain assumption. We demonstrate via simulation that the algorithm
   finds up to 47.6 percent additional task sets that are schedulable with
   mpn-FP (likewise mpn-EDF), but not with fp-FP and np-FP (likewise fp-EDF
   and np-EDF).}},

Abstract = {{In multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar settings, it is often
   desirable to transmit power only to a given location or set of locations
   defined by a beampattern. Transmit waveform design is a topic that has
   received much attention recently, involving synthesis of both the signal
   covariance matrix,, as well as the actual waveforms. Current methods
   involve a two-step process of designing via iterative solutions and then
   using to generate waveforms that fulfill practical constraints such as
   having a constant-envelope or drawing from a finite alphabet. In this
   paper, a closed-form method to design for a uniform linear array is
   proposed that utilizes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients
   and Toeplitz matrices. The resulting covariance matrix fulfills the
   practical constraints such as positive semidefiniteness and the
   uniformelemental power constraint and provides performance similar to
   that of iterative methods, which require a much greater computation
   time. Next, a transmit architecture is presented that exploits the
   orthogonality of frequencies at discrete DFT values to transmit a sum of
   orthogonal signals from each antenna. The resulting waveforms provide a
   lower mean-square error than current methods at a much lower
   computational cost, and a simulated detection scenario demonstrates the
   performance advantages achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess whether an increase in a subvolume of intrahepatic
   tumor with elevated arterial perfusion during radiation therapy (RT)
   predicts tumor progression after RT.
   Methods and Materials: Twenty patients with unresectable intrahepatic
   cancers undergoing RT were enrolled in a prospective, institutional
   review board-approved study. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
   resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) was performed before RT (pre-RT), after
   delivering similar to 60\% of the planned dose (mid-RT) and 1 month
   after completion of RT to quantify hepatic arterial perfusion. The
   arterial perfusions of the tumors at pre-RT were clustered into
   low-normal and elevated perfusion by a fuzzy clustering-based method,
   and the tumor subvolumes with elevated arterial perfusion were extracted
   from the hepatic arterial perfusion images. The percentage changes in
   the tumor subvolumes and means of arterial perfusion over the tumors
   from pre-RT to mid-RT were evaluated for predicting tumor progression
   post-RT.
   Results: Of the 24 tumors, 6 tumors in 5 patients progressed 5 to 21
   months after RT completion. Neither tumor volumes nor means of tumor
   arterial perfusion at pre-RT were predictive of treatment outcome. The
   mean arterial perfusion over the tumors increased significantly at
   mid-RT in progressive tumors compared with the responsive tumors
   (P=.006). From pre-RT to mid-RT, the responsive tumors had a decrease in
   the tumor subvolumes with elevated arterial perfusion (median, -14\%;
   range, -75\% to 65\%), whereas the progressive tumors had an increase of
   the subvolumes (median, 57\%; range, -7\% to 165\%)(P=.003). Receiver
   operating characteristic analysis of the percentage change in the
   subvolume for predicting tumor progression post-RT had an area under the
   curve of 0.90.
   Conclusion: The increase in the subvolume of the intrahepatic tumor with
   elevated arterial perfusion during RT has the potential to be a
   predictor for tumor progression post-RT. The tumor subvolume could be a
   radiation boost candidate for response-driven adaptive RT. (C) 2014

Title = {{Construction Workers' Perceptions and Attitudes toward Social Norms as
   Predictors of Their Absence Behavior}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Because construction operations depend on labor activity, absenteeism on
   a job site can damage project performance in many ways. Traditionally,
   construction managers have viewed absenteeism as a problem of
   individuals and have not paid much attention to absenteeism as a
   group-level phenomenon. As a result, individually focused formal rule
   enforcement (e.g.,issuing a penalty) has been used to reduce absenteeism
   in construction projects, but this approach often results in the
   insufficient encouragement of attendance motivation. To better manage
   workers' attendance on job sites, another aspect in absenteeism that has
   recently received attention is behavioral control of workers, including
   how workers perceive formal and social rules for absence, build
   attitudes toward these rules, and control their absence behavior
   accordingly. With this background, the objective of this paper is to
   investigate the relationship between workers' perceptions/attitudes
   toward formal/social rules and their absence behavior by using
   real-world data. To fulfill this objective, a survey questionnaire was
   developed, data were collected from three different job sites, and
   statistical analyses were performed using logistic regression models.
   The results of the analyses show that construction workers who perceive
   salient social norms in their team are less likely to be absent from the
   job site, which implies that worker absence behavior is under the
   influence of social controls. It is also found that the primary
   mechanism by which social controls on workers' behavior take place in
   construction is self-categorization. The results of this research extend
   the current knowledge of the mechanism and the role of social controls
   in shaping construction workers' absence behavior. From the results, it
   is inferred that even a modest investment in promoting social cohesion
   and creating a positive prototype in teams can be an effective means of
   maintaining low absenteeism on a job site.}},

Abstract = {{In day-to-day traffic assignment problems travelers' past experiences
   have important impact on their cost prediction which influences their
   route choice and consequently the arising flow patterns in the network.
   Many travelers execute the same trip in every few days, not daily, which
   leads to time delays in the system. In this paper, we propose a
   nonlinear, discrete-time model with driver experience delay. The linear
   stability of the stochastic user equilibrium is analyzed by studying the
   eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the system while the nonlinear
   oscillations arising at the bifurcations are investigated by normal form
   calculations, numerical continuation and simulation. The methods are
   demonstrated on a two-route example. By applying rigorous analysis we
   show that the linearly unstable parameter domain as well as the period
   of arising oscillations increase with the delay. Moreover, delays and
   nonlinearities result in an extended domain of bistability where the
   stochastic user equilibrium coexists with stable and unstable
   oscillations. This study explains the influence of initial conditions on
   the dynamics of transportation networks and may provide guidance for
   network design and management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In an attempt to improve the performance of vibration-based energy
   harvesters, many authors suggest that nonlinearities can be exploited to
   increase the bandwidths of linear devices. Nevertheless, the complex
   dependence of the response upon the input excitation has made a
   realistic comparison of linear harvesters with nonlinear energy
   harvesters challenging. In a previous work it has been demonstrated that
   for a given frequency of excitation, it is possible to achieve the same
   maximum power for a nonlinear harvester as that for a linear harvester,
   provided that the resistance and the linear stiffness of both are
   optimized. This work focuses on the bandwidths of linear and nonlinear
   harvesters and shows which device is more suitable for harvesting energy
   from vibrations. The work considers different levels of excitation as
   well as different frequencies of excitation. In addition, the effect of
   the mechanical damping of the oscillator on the power bandwidth is shown
   for both the linear and nonlinear cases.}},

Abstract = {{Contact dynamics of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are typically
   complicated and it is consequently difficult to model all dynamic
   characteristics observed in time-domain responses involving impact. This
   issue becomes worse when a device, such as a mobile micro-robot, is not
   clamped to a substrate and has a complex mechanical structure. To
   characterize such a contact interaction situation, two walking
   micro-robot prototypes are tested having intentionally simple structures
   with different dimensions (21.2 mm x 16.3 mm x 0.75 mm and 32 mm x 25.4
   mm x 4.1 mm) and weights (0.16 and 2.7 g). Contact interaction behaviors
   are characterized by analyzing experimental data under various
   excitation signals. A numerical approach was used to derive a novel
   contact model consisting of a coefficient of restitution matrix that
   uses modal vibration information. Experimental validation of the
   simulation model shows that it captures various dynamic features of the
   contact interaction when simulating leg behavior more accurately than
   previous contact models, such as single-point coefficient of restitution
   or compliant ground models. In addition, this paper shows that
   small-scale forces can be added to the simulation to improve model
   accuracy, resulting in average errors across driving conditions on the
   order of 2-6\% for bounce frequency, maximum foot height, and average
   foot height, although there is substantial variation from case to case.}},

Abstract = {{The Radio Aurora Explorer (RAX) is a CubeSat that was developed to study
   space weather in Earth's ionosphere. The scientific payload is a
   bistatic radar system in which an onboard receiver works in cooperation
   with a ground-based transmitter. Accuracy of the onboard clock is
   critical for processing the radar measurements. The RAX timing system
   utilizes commercial off-the-shelf components integrated into custom
   subsystems. GPS is used to maintain absolute timing accuracy better than
   1 vs, but the subsystem is not always available due to power
   constraints, so a method has been developed to correct the onboard clock
   error without the use of GPS. The clock correction utilizes range
   measurements extracted from the pulses emitted by the transmitter, and
   resulting absolute clock accuracies of better than 0.20 s with drift of
   less than 21 ns/s have been demonstrated. The RAX timing system and the
   clock correction algorithm are presented as a reference for other
   spacecraft designers and are critical for those analyzing RAX data. (C)

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The interaction of dislocation channels with grain boundaries in
   irradiated stainless steel was observed on multiple length scales using
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) digital image correlation (DIC) and
   confocal microscopy (micro-scale), in situ straining and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) (nano-scale), and atomistic modeling (atomic
   scale). Interactions were divided into three classifications; slip
   transmission, discontinuous slip, and discontinuous slip that induced
   grain boundary slip. DIC and confocal microscopy were used to quantify
   the plastic strain at dislocation channel-GB intersections. In situ TEM
   was used to image dislocations inside of channels as they interacted
   with the grain boundary. Slip in the dislocation channels, as observed
   by TEM, was found to involve cross slip between different slip planes,
   as well as the possibility of different slip systems activated on
   parallel slip planes. Atomistic simulations agreed well with experiments
   on the nature of channel-grain boundary interactions and also showed
   elevated levels of elastic stress at DC-GB intersections where slip was
   discontinuous with no slip transmission. The two distinct
   classifications of discontinuous slip are significant, suggesting two
   possible cracking mechanisms that both lead to the rupture of the oxide
   over the grain boundary. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Turbulent mixing generated by shock-driven acceleration of a perturbed
   interface is simulated using a new multi-component Reynolds-averaged
   Navier-Stokes (RANS) model closed with a two-equation - model. The model
   is implemented in a hydrodynamics code using a third-order weighted
   essentially non-oscillatory finite-difference method for the advection
   terms and a second-order central difference method for the gradients in
   the source and diffusion terms. In the present reshocked
   Richtmyer-Meshkov instability and mixing study, an incident shock with
   Mach number is generated in air and progresses into a sulfur
   hexafluoride test section. The time evolution of the predicted mixing
   layer widths corresponding to six shock tube test section lengths are
   compared with experimental measurements and three-dimensional multi-mode
   numerical simulations. The mixing layer widths are also compared with
   the analytical self-similar power-law solution of the simplified model
   equations prior to reshock. A set of model coefficients and initial
   conditions specific to these six experiments is established, for which
   the widths before and after reshock agree very well with experimental
   and numerical simulation data. A second set of general coefficients that
   accommodates a broader range of incident shock Mach numbers, Atwood
   numbers, and test section lengths is also established by incorporating
   additional experimental data for , , and with and with and previous RANS
   modeling. Terms in the budgets of the turbulent kinetic energy and
   dissipation rate equations are examined to evaluate the relative
   importance of turbulence production, dissipation and diffusion
   mechanisms during mixing. Convergence results for the mixing layer
   widths, mean fields, and turbulent fields under grid refinement are
   presented for each of the cases.}},

Abstract = {{Angiogenesis is the growth of new capillaries from existing vasculature.
   Vascular network formation is known to be regulated by the biophysical
   and biochemical signals emanating from the microenvironment. However, it
   is not clear how endothelial cells integrate these signals to drive the
   capillary morphogenesis. In this study, human umbilical endothelial
   cells (HUVECs) were seeded on scaffolds with varying stiffness and
   capillary formation was quantified. Our study revealed that cells formed
   well defined networks on compliant gels. Increase in stiffness resulted
   in a decrease in sprouting. VEGF was encapsulated within the scaffolds
   at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 ng/mL to investigate the
   interplay between VEGF concentration profiles and matrix stiffness in
   guiding network formation. Quantitative analysis revealed that while
   VEGF disrupted sprout formation on compliant substrates, it elicited a
   sprouting response in cells seeded on scaffolds of intermediate
   rigidity. Additionally, we also observed that a minimum cell density is
   required for the formation of well-connected vascular networks.}},

Abstract = {{We have adapted our existing compression-induced fracture technology to
   cell culture studies by generating linear patterns on a complex cell
   culture well structure rather than on simple solid constructs. We
   present a simple method to create one-dimensional (1D), submicron, and
   linear patterns of extracellular matrix on a multilayer silicone
   material. We identified critical design parameters necessary to optimize
   compression-induced fracture patterning on the wells, and applied
   stresses using compression Hoffman clamps. Finite-element analyses show
   that the incorporation of the well improves stress homogeneity (stress
   variation = 25\%), and, thus, crack uniformity over the patterned
   region. Notably, a shallow well with a thick base (vs. deeper wells with
   thinner bases) reduces out-of-plane deflections by greater than a sixth
   in the cell culture region, improving clarity for optical imaging. The
   comparison of cellular and nuclear shape indices of a neuroblast line
   cultured on patterned 1D lines and unpatterned 2D surfaces reveals
   significant differences in cellular morphology, which could impact many
   cellular functions. Because 1D cell cultures recapitulate many important
   phenotypical traits of 3D cell cultures, our culture system offers a
   simple means to further study the relationship between 1D and 3D cell
   culture environments, without demanding expensive engineering techniques

Title = {{Spatial-Temporal Survey and Occupancy-Abundance Modeling To Predict
   Bacterial Community Dynamics in the Drinking Water Microbiome}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Bacterial communities migrate continuously from the drinking water
   treatment plant through the drinking water distribution system and into
   our built environment. Understanding bacterial dynamics in the
   distribution system is critical to ensuring that safe drinking water is
   being supplied to customers. We present a 15-month survey of bacterial
   community dynamics in the drinking water system of Ann Arbor, MI. By
   sampling the water leaving the treatment plant and at nine points in the
   distribution system, we show that the bacterial community spatial
   dynamics of distance decay and dispersivity conform to the layout of the
   drinking water distribution system. However, the patterns in spatial
   dynamics were weaker than those for the temporal trends, which exhibited
   seasonal cycling correlating with temperature and source water use
   patterns and also demonstrated reproducibility on an annual time scale.
   The temporal trends were driven by two seasonal bacterial clusters
   consisting of multiple taxa with different networks of association
   within the larger drinking water bacterial community. Finally, we show
   that the Ann Arbor data set robustly conforms to previously described
   interspecific occupancy abundance models that link the relative
   abundance of a taxon to the frequency of its detection. Relying on these
   insights, we propose a predictive framework for microbial management in
   drinking water systems. Further, we recommend that long-term microbial
   observatories that collect high-resolution, spatially distributed,
   multiyear time series of community composition and environmental
   variables be established to enable the development and testing of the
   predictive framework.
   IMPORTANCE Safe and regulation-compliant drinking water may contain up
   to millions of microorganisms per liter, representing phylogenetically
   diverse groups of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya that affect public
   health, water infrastructure, and the aesthetic quality of water. The
   ability to predict the dynamics of the drinking water microbiome will
   ensure that microbial contamination risks can be better managed. Through
   a spatial-temporal survey of drinking water bacterial communities, we
   present novel insights into their spatial and temporal community
   dynamics and recommend steps to link these insights in a predictive
   framework for microbial management of drinking water systems. Such a
   predictive framework will not only help to eliminate microbial risks but
   also help to modify existing water quality monitoring efforts and make
   them more resource efficient. Further, a predictive framework for
   microbial management will be critical if we are to fully anticipate the
   risks and benefits of the beneficial manipulation of the drinking water
   microbiome.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the shift control strategy and the related
   experiments for dry dual clutch transmissions (DCT). The gearshift
   processes, upshifts and downshifts, have been analyzed by model
   simulation. The control strategies for both the torque phase and the
   inertia phase of both clutches are proposed during the shift process
   respectively. The throttle controller for engine torque and clutch
   torque controllers have been designed for both torque phase and inertia
   phase. The system model has been established on Matlab/Simulink
   platform. The simulation results show that the proposed control
   strategies satisfy the shifting requirement in terms of shift response
   and smoothness. Furthermore, the experiment on the prototype vehicle
   equipped with DCT has been conducted to analyze the shifting process
   with the control strategy proposed in this paper. The test data is
   highly agreeable to the simulation data and the effectiveness of shift
   control strategies is validated by the comparison between simulation
   results and the test data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the influence of some leading design parameters
   on the force performance of a new complementary and modular linear
   flux-switching permanent-magnet (LFSPM) motor. The originality of the
   proposed structure is that each phase consists of two ``E{''}-shaped
   modules, whose positions are mutually 180 degrees electrical degrees
   apart. Also, there is a flux barrier between the two modules. First, the
   structure and influence of some leading design parameters on the force
   performance of the complementary and modular LFSPM motor are analyzed.
   Then, a conventional LFSPM motor obtained directly from a rotary FSPM
   motor is optimized and compared with the complementary and modular LFSPM
   motor based on finite-element method. The results reveal that the
   proposed motor has sinusoidal and symmetrical three-phase back
   electromotive force waveforms and smaller cogging force and force ripple
   than the existing motors. Moreover, a prototype of the proposed motor is
   built to validate the study.}},

   geopolymer composites were developed by using randomly oriented short
   Poly-Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) fibers. Subsequently, their mechanical
   properties were investigated by cube compressive and dogbone tensile
   testing. Tensile strain hardening behavior with very high ductility of
   over 4\% was experimentally demonstrated for the developed composites.
   These performances were found to be further improved by utilizing
   temperature curing methods. Crack width distributions were also
   investigated by using the Digital Image Correlation technique. The
   analysis indicated that the maximum and average crack widths are 117 lam
   and 45 lam, respectively, even at a high imposed strain level of 4.5\%.
   Therefore, the feasibility of strain-hardening ductile geopolymer
   composites was established. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using methods from random matrix theory researchers have recently
   calculated the full spectra of random networks with arbitrary degrees
   and with community structure. Both reveal interesting spectral features,
   including deviations from the Wigner semicircle distribution and phase
   transitions in the spectra of community structured networks. In this
   paper we generalize both calculations, giving a prescription for
   calculating the spectrum of a network with both community structure and
   an arbitrary degree distribution. In general the spectrum has two parts,
   a continuous spectral band, which can depart strongly from the classic
   semicircle form, and a set of outlying eigenvalues that indicate the
   presence of communities.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, we report on results of simulation-based study of
   mechanical response behavior and mechanisms of failure of a
   nanometer-scale polyimide adherent thin-film on a silicon substrate. A
   transition between adhesive and cohesive modes of failure with the
   strain rate was shown to occur in the system, subjected to high
   strain-rate tensile loadings. The physical mechanisms, leading to the
   bi-material failure, were identified for each failure mode. The study
   reveals that damage development and propagation are determined by a
   complex interplay between coupling across the interface and relaxation
   processes in the adherent layer. The two act in a synergistic manner to
   generate an instability, leading to either cohesive or adhesive failure.

Title = {{Atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharges interacting with

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{The interaction of plasmas with liquids is of increasing importance in
   biomedical applications. Tissues treated by atmospheric pressure
   dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) in plasma medicine are often
   covered by a thin layer of liquid, typically a blood serum like water
   with dissolved gases and proteins up to hundreds of micrometres thick.
   The liquid processes the plasma-produced radicals and ions prior to
   their reaching the tissue. In this paper, we report on a computational
   investigation of the interaction of DBDs in humid air with a thin water
   layer covering tissue. The water layer, 50-400 mu m thick, contains
   dissolved O-2aq ((aq) means an aqueous species) and alkane-like
   hydrocarbons (RHaq). In the model, the DBDs are operated with multiple
   pulses at 100 Hz followed by a 1 s afterglow. Gas phase reactive oxygen
   and nitrogen species (RONS) intersect the water-vapour saturated air
   above the liquid and then solvate when reaching the water. The
   photolysis of water by plasma-produced UV/VUV plays a significant role
   in the production of radicals. Without RHaq, O-2aq(-), ONOOaq-, NO3aq-
   and hydronium (H3Oaq+) dominate the water ions with H3Oaq+ determining
   the pH. The dominant RONS in the liquid are O-3aq, H2O2aq, and HNOxaq.
   Dissolved O-2aq assists the production of HNO3aq and HOONOaq during the
   afterglow. With RHaq, reactive oxygen species are largely consumed,
   leaving an R.(aq) (alkyl radical) to reach the tissue. These results are
   sensitive to the thickness of the water layer.}},

Abstract = {{We theoretically study the dynamic and static effects of mechanical
   stress on a straintronics device that includes a piezoelectric film

   magnetostriction effect is studied in detail by realizing the varying

   is developed based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which
   provides a platform to simulate the magnetization vector's behavior,
   critical flipping voltage, and delay properties. Furthermore, by
   converting the LLG equation into a 2nd order damping differential
   equation, we develop a proximate approach. This approach predicts the
   dynamic behavior of the magnetization vector and its dependency on
   material properties and applied voltage across the device without using
   sophisticated numerical calculations of the LLG model. Different dynamic
   and static material properties are observed by simulating five common

Abstract = {{Maintenance of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) by fast rotors in the
   left atrium (LA) or at the pulmonary veins (PVs) is not fully
   understood. To gain insight into this dynamic and complex process, we
   studied the role of the heterogeneous distribution of transmembrane
   currents in the PVs and LA junction (PV-LAJ) in the localization of
   rotors in the PVs. We also investigated whether simple pacing protocols
   could be used to predict rotor drift in the PV-LAJ. Experimentally
   observed heterogeneities in 40, l(K1), l(Ks), l(kr), l(to) and l(caL) in
   the PV-LAJ were incorporated into two- and pseudo three-dimensional
   models of Courtemanche-Ramirez-Nattel-Kneller human atrial kinetics to
   simulate various conditions and investigate rotor drifting mechanisms.
   Spatial gradients in the currents resulted in shorter action potential
   duration, minimum diastolic potential that was less negative, and slower
   upstroke and conduction velocity for rotors in the PV region than in the
   LA. Rotors under such conditions drifted toward the PV and stabilized at
   the shortest action potential duration and less-excitable region,
   consistent with drift direction under intercellular coupling
   heterogeneities and regardless of the geometrical constraint in the PVs.
   Simulations with various l(K1) gradient conditions and current-voltage
   relationships substantiated its major role in the rotor drift. In our
   1:1 pacing protocol, we found that among various action potential
   properties, only the minimum diastolic potential gradient was a
   rate-independent predictor of rotor drift direction. Consistent with
   experimental and clinical AF studies, simulations in an

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an innovative game theoretic framework for a
   next-generation retail electricity market ({''}Energy Internet{''}) with
   high penetration of distributed residential electricity suppliers
   ({''}Energy Cells{''}). The envisioned Energy Internet is developed for
   plug-and-play of a large number of distributed renewable energy
   generation and energy storage. The residential customers, referred as
   Energy Cells, are not only the electricity consumers but can also be the
   electricity suppliers by locally operating and managing their own
   distributed generators, distributed energy storage devices, and
   dispatchable loads. This paper formulates a set of mathematical models
   of the retail electricity market participants with a number of local and
   global constraints. A numerical case study is performed to validate the
   proposed next-generation retail electricity market framework using
   game-theoretic methodologies. The numerical simulation results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed market clearing scheme
   with high penetration of distributed residential electricity suppliers.

Title = {{A review on TiO2-based nanotubes synthesized via hydrothermal method:

   applications}},
Journal = {{CATALYSIS TODAY}},

Volume = {{225}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{TiO2 nanotubes or titanate nanotubes (TNTs), which are produced by
   hydrothermal synthesis, have received increasing attention for
   photocatalytic applications due to their unique physicochemical
   properties, such as nanotubular structure with layered walls, high
   surface area, ion-exchange ability, and photocatalytic activity. The
   hydrothermal method that has been widely applied for preparation of
   catalysts in industry like zeolites, is a simple and mature synthesis
   technique, in which the properties of products depend on the formation
   mechanism and hydrothermal conditions. Focusing on the structure of TNTs
   including crystallography and morphology from the extensive literature,
   this paper discusses the formation mechanisms of TNTs during
   hydrothermal synthesis. The effects of synthesis conditions (TiO2
   precursor, hydrothermal temperature and duration), auxiliary methods
   (ultrasonication and microwaveassistance), and post treatment (acid
   washing and calcination) on the formation of titanate nanotubes are
   reviewed. Furthermore, structural modifications and current progress
   toward photocatalytic activity of TNTs as photocatalysts are also
   summarized in this review. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{Custom-defined oligonucleotide collections have a broad range of
   applications in fields of synthetic biology, targeted sequencing, and
   cytogenetics. Also, they are used to encode information for technologies
   like RNA interference, protein engineering and DNA-encoded libraries.
   High-throughput parallel DNA synthesis technologies developed for the
   manufacture of DNA microarrays can produce libraries of large numbers of
   different oligonucleotides, but in very limited amounts. Here, we
   compare three approaches to prepare large quantities of single-stranded
   oligonucleotide libraries derived from microarray synthesized
   collections. The first approach, alkaline melting of double-stranded PCR
   amplified libraries with a biotinylated strand captured on streptavidin
   coated magnetic beads results in little or no non-biotinylated ssDNA.
   The second method wherein the phosphorylated strand of PCR amplified
   libraries is nucleolyticaly hydrolyzed is recommended when small amounts
   of libraries are needed. The third method combining in vitro
   transcription of PCR amplified libraries to reverse transcription of the
   RNA product into single-stranded cDNA is our recommended method to
   produce large amounts of oligonucleotide libraries. Finally, we propose
   a method to remove any primer binding sequences introduced during
   library amplification.}},

   mechanical properties}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{Multicomponent lipid vesicles are commonly used as a model system for
   the complex plasma membrane. One phenomenon that is studied using such
   model systems is phase separation. Vesicles composed of simple lipid
   mixtures can phase-separate into liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered
   phases, and since these phases can have different mechanical properties,
   this separation can lead to changes in the shape of the vesicle. In this
   work, we investigate the dynamics of phase separation in multicomponent
   lipid vesicles, using a model that couples composition to mechanical
   properties such as bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature. The model
   allows the vesicle surface to deform while conserving surface area and
   composition. For vesicles initialized as spheres, we study the effects
   of phase fraction and spontaneous curvature. We additionally initialize
   two systems with elongated, spheroidal shapes. Dynamic behavior is
   contrasted in systems where only one phase has a spontaneous curvature
   similar to the overall vesicle surface curvature and systems where the
   spontaneous curvatures of both phases are similar to the overall
   curvature. The bending energy contribution is typically found to slow
   the dynamics by stabilizing configurations with multiple domains. Such
   multiple-domain configurations are found more often in vesicles with
   spheroidal shapes than in nearly spherical vesicles. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Bifurcation-based mass sensing provides for dramatically enhanced
   detection sensitivity and less performance deterioration due to
   measurement noise as compared to frequency shift-based methods. Recent
   bifurcation-based mass sensing studies have employed directly excited
   nonlinear oscillators to induce critical jump events, but the approaches
   may still require active tracking hardware to determine exact mass
   adsorption, could induce adverse nonlinear phenomena by prolonged
   excitation near the bifurcation, and are limited in the number and
   versatility of jump events. In this work, an alternative sensor
   architecture and method for mass sensing are presented to address these
   concerns. The architecture is based upon the coupling of a host linear
   structure to a small bistable inclusion. It is shown that the sensor
   enables unique functionality including means for passive mass
   quantification and direct adjustment of bifurcation sweeping rate for
   reliable detection and enhanced robustness to noise. Deterministic,
   stochastic, and non-stationary analyses demonstrate the operational
   principles and sensitivities of the method while experiments with
   proof-of-concept samples corroborate analytical results and give clear
   evidence of the advantages of the new approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of preassembled sodium dodecy sulfate
   (SDS) micelles are carried out using three versions of GROMOS, as well
   as CHARMM36, OPLS-AA, and OPLS-UA force fields at different aggregation
   numbers and box sizes. The differences among force fields have little
   effect on the overall micelle structure of small aggregates of size 60
   or 100, but for micelles of an aggregation number of 300 or higher,
   bicelle structures with ordered tails, rather than the more realistic
   rodlike or cylindrical micelles with disordered tails, occur when using
   versions of GROMOS45A3 or the OPLS-AA force fields that are adapted to
   model the sulfate head group atoms using methods given in the
   literature. We find that the Lennard-Jones (L-J) parameters for the
   sodium ions and the ionic oxygens of the SDS head group, as well as the
   water model, control the transition to bicelles, regardless of other L-J
   parameters. A closer binding of the sodium ions to the head group ionic
   oxygens screens the electrostatic repulsions more strongly, resulting in
   condensation of SDS head groups, leading to unphysical bicelles for
   GROMOS45A3 or the OPLS-AA force fields, when the aggregation number is
   large. A telltale sign that the sodium oxygen interaction is too strong
   shows up in high nearest neighbor peaks (height >8 and height >20 for
   micelles with 60 and 100 surfactants, respectively) in the radial
   distribution functions (RDFs) of sodium ions to ionic oxygens. In the
   100-surfactant micelles, the high RDF peak is accompanied by
   ``crystal-like{''} layering of sodium ions onto the surface of the
   micelle. The distance between the sodium ions and micelle also depends
   on the number of waters binding to sodium ions in the presence of
   surfactant head groups, which depends on both the sodium ion and water
   models, and for the same sodium model increases as the water model is
   changed in the order: TIP4P, SPC/E, SPC, and TIP3P,}},

Title = {{Symmetry-protected mode coupling near normal incidence for narrow-band
   transmission filtering in a dielectric grating}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{A narrow-band transmission filter is demonstrated near normal incidence
   that operates through relaxation of supported-mode selection rules and
   is explained in the context of group theory. We calculated the
   transverse magnetic and transverse electric dispersion relations of a
   dielectric grating in the subwavelength and near-wavelength region using
   finite element modal analysis and determine the modes' corresponding
   irreducible representations. Coupling to select transverse magnetic
   modes at normal incidence is optimized to yield broadband high
   reflectance that acts as the background for the transmission filter.
   While some modes couple at normal incidence, others are shown to remain
   inaccessible due to symmetry mismatch. Away from normal incidence, the
   reduced symmetry relaxes the selection rules, enabling weak coupling
   between the incident field and these symmetry-protected modes. This weak
   coupling produces narrow transmission bands within the opaque
   background. Furthermore, by choosing the plane of incidence to include
   or exclude the grating periodicity, we show that orthogonal mode sets
   can independently be selected to couple to the incident light, yielding
   separate transmission bands. This spectral filtering is experimentally
   demonstrated with a suspended silicon grating in the infrared spectrum
   (7-14 mu m), which agrees well with simulated transmittance spectra and
   modal analysis.}},

Title = {{The role of series ankle elasticity in bipedal walking}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{346}},
Pages = {{75-85}},
Month = {{APR 7}},
Abstract = {{The elastic stretch-shortening cycle of the Achilles tendon during
   walking can reduce the active work demands on the plantarflexor muscles
   in series. However, this does not explain why or when this ankle work,
   whether by muscle or tendon, needs to be performed during gait We
   therefore employ a simple bipedal walking model to investigate how ankle
   work and series elasticity impact economical locomotion. Our model shows
   that ankle elasticity can use passive dynamics to aid push-off late in
   single support, redirecting the body's center-of-mass (COM) motion
   upward. An appropriately timed, elastic push-off helps to reduce
   dissipative collision losses at contralateral heelstrike, and therefore
   the positive work needed to offset those losses and power steady
   walking. Thus, the model demonstrates how elastic ankle work can reduce
   the total energetic demands of walking, including work required from
   more proximal knee and hip muscles. We found that the key requirement
   for using ankle elasticity to achieve economical gait is the proper
   ratio of ankle stiffness to foot length. Optimal combination of these
   parameters ensures proper timing of elastic energy release prior to
   contralateral heelstrike, and sufficient energy storage to redirect the
   COM velocity. In fact, there exist parameter combinations that
   theoretically yield collision-free walking, thus requiring zero active
   work, albeit with relatively high ankle torques. Ankle elasticity also
   allows the hip to power economical walking by contributing indirectly to
   push-off. Whether walking is powered by the ankle or hip, ankle
   elasticity may aid walking economy by reducing collision losses. (C)

Abstract = {{Temperature-programmed decomposition of PdO supported on
   high-surface-area alumina occurs in a two-step process starting near the
   temperature of bulk PdO decomposition, but slowing to near-zero rates as
   the bulk oxide decomposition temperature is traversed. Most of the oxide
   decomposes in a second step 40-60 degrees C above the bulk PdO
   decomposition temperature. We present evidence suggesting that a thin Pd
   shell forms initially on the surface of PdO particles and propose that
   the resulting core-shell structure is connected with the observed
   meta-stability. Both the experimental results and order-of-magnitude
   estimates indicate that neither small particle effects (metal-support
   interaction or surface energy) nor low oxygen permeability through the
   Pd shell explain the two-step process. We tentatively ascribe the
   higher-temperature PdO decomposition step to the contribution of strain
   energy to the Pd shell imparted by epitaxy with the underlying PdO
   lattice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When a mechanical and/or structural component is immersed in a fluid and
   it vibrates, the reasonable assumption is that part of the energy is
   transmitted to the adjacent media. For some engineering applications the
   energy transport between these two domains, i.e., structure and fluid,
   plays a central role. The work presented in this paper is focused on
   discussing the energy transport in beam-like structures as they can be
   used to represent flexible swimmers (fish-like pulsating mechanisms) in
   their simplest form. In order to expose the role of each of the fluid
   and beam properties effecting the energy transfer process, a simplified
   analytical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model is derived. After
   analysis of the resulting coupled-systems' damping coefficient, a new
   energy transport component is added to the initial Euler-Bernoulli beam
   equation; a term associated with diffusion (fluid viscosity). In
   addition our modeling results in an added mass term, a characteristic
   consistent with previous literature. While deriving the model, an
   important assumption is made: beam mode shapes are not significantly
   affected by the domains' interaction. This hypothesis is experimentally
   tested in two different fluid media and confirmed to be reasonable for
   the first three vibration mode shapes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the odyssey of achieving further lightweight space structures and
   systems, optical-quality membrane mirrors are expected to replace the
   conventional, metal-based and glass-based, rigid mirrors. These thin
   film membranes offer an order of magnitude size increase in apertures
   and in weight reduction. Some of these membrane mirrors are coupled to a
   pressurized cavity with the end goal of using the pressure in the
   chamber for shape control. The replacement of rigid mirrors for optical
   quality membrane mirrors is still a large area of research with many
   questions thus far requiring further investigation. These areas include
   modeling, material properties, fabrication due to high tolerances
   required for imaging, storage, and deployability. The ability to
   accurately model and predict the dynamics of these space-based membrane
   mirrors is of great importance. This will lead to more adequate design
   and manufacturing processes and optimized performance of such systems.
   The work presented here focuses on the validation of an impedance-based
   model of a membrane in air and of a coupled membrane-cavity system using
   experimental results. The impedance based model takes into account sound
   radiation and energy loss to the far field. This is crucial in
   earth-based telescopes and also very important when testing and
   validating these systems on earth before being launched into space.

Abstract = {{To assemble a product, each and every part is required. Hence, the more
   parts in the product, the greater the risk of disruption. Compared with
   retailers or assemblers of simple products, manufacturers of complex
   products are much more sensitive to supply chain delays. This heightened
   vulnerability to supply chain disruptions should lead complex product
   assemblers to design less risky supply chains. Supply chain design
   should depend on the complexity of the product assembled or
   manufactured. This paper models how product complexity drives the
   likelihood of disruption for given component supply chain reliabilities.
   The paper provides insights for supply chain design that comprehends the
   impact of product complexity.}},

   online through a fixed updating schedule. Results for three standard
   genetic algorithm test cases and a two-objective stiffened panel
   optimization problem are presented. For the stiffened panel problem,
   statistical analysis of four performance metrics are used to compare the
   Pareto fronts between the VFO method, full high-fidelity optimizer runs,
   and Pareto fronts developed by enumeration. The fixed updating approach
   is shown to reduce the number of high-fidelity calls significantly while
   approximating the Pareto front in an efficient manner.}},

Abstract = {{Formulating control commands for decision makers in an extended complex
   mission that involves adversarial behavior has recently received
   significant attention. Missions of this type are typically modeled by a
   nonlinear discrete time dynamic system. The state is controlled by two
   decision makers, each with a different objective function and hierarchy
   of decision-making structure. To illustrate such a mission, we derive a
   state space dynamic model of an extended complex military operation that
   involves two opposing forces engaged in a battle. The model assumes a
   number of fixed targets that one force is attacking and the other is
   defending. Due to the number of control commands, the options for each
   force, and the steps during which the two forces could be engaged, the
   optimal solution for such a complicated dynamic game over all stages is
   computationally extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prove. As an
   alternative, we propose an expeditious suboptimal solution for this type
   of adversarial engagement. We discuss a solution approach where the
   decisions are decomposed hierarchically, and the task allocation is
   separated from cooperation decisions. This novel decoupled solution,
   although suboptimal in the global sense, is useful when decisions should
   be taken swiftly in the presence of adversaries. Some example scenarios
   illustrating this military model and our solution approach are
   presented.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{76-88}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the ability of micro-radio repeaters for
   managing wave propagation by enhancing signal coverage for the nodes of
   a mobile ad-hoc network in a complex environment. Such radio repeaters
   can be considered to be scatterers with a large radar cross section
   (RCS). Strategically positioning them enables a chain of line-of-sight
   (LoS) propagation between the transmitter and receiver when the straight
   signal path is blocked by obstacles such as walls. To specify repeater
   parameters, wave propagation in various hallway junctions were analyzed
   using a ray-tracing method that accounted for reflection, penetration,
   and diffraction. By adding the repeater model to such propagation
   models, the ability of micro-radio-repeater systems to enhance wave
   propagation in indoor environments was demonstrated. The results were
   verified with various measurement examples using a bench-top repeater
   system at 2.4 GHz. To allow multiple access through a single repeater, a
   simple repeater structure, composed of two omnidirectional antennas and
   one amplifier with sufficient gain, was considered. Measurement results
   indicated that in the chosen various indoor scenarios, a repeater system
   with an active gain of more than 35 dB with omnidirectional antennas
   could present scattering larger than typical building diffraction, and
   thus could enhance signal connectivity at 2.4 GHz.}},

Journal = {{OPTIMIZATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{One of the core problems in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
   treatment planning is the fluence map optimization (FMO) problem, which
   determines a fluence map (or profile) for each beam used in the delivery
   of treatment. Radiation therapy is administered in multiple so-called
   daily fractions to allow for healthy tissue to recover from damage
   caused by the treatment. Before the advent of IMRT, the treatment was
   designed to ensure a constant dose to cells in the target (the areas in
   the patient where cancerous cells are present or suspected). In the
   presence of multiple targets with different prescribed doses, this
   design meant that treatment had to be delivered in a sequence of unequal
   fractions, one per prescription dose level. For example, in case of two
   targets treatment would consist of an initial plan aimed at treating
   both targets to a lower total dose, followed by a so-called boost plan
   aimed at delivering the additional dose at the target with higher
   prescribed dose. In contrast, IMRT treatment plans are often delivered
   with equal treatment plan for each fraction, which means that the dose
   per fraction cannot be the same for all targets. The important problem
   of restoring traditional fractionation to IMRT treatments has not yet
   received much attention in the literature. In this paper we propose a
   new optimization model that explicitly restores fractionation into the
   FMO problem, yielding an optimal set of fluence maps for each fraction.
   We illustrate the capabilities of our approach on clinical head-and-neck
   cancer cases.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recent progress suggests gene therapy may one day be an option for
   treating some forms of limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD).
   Nevertheless, approaches targeting LGMD have so far focused on gene
   replacement strategies for recessive forms of the disease. In contrast,
   no attempts have been made to develop molecular therapies for any of the
   eight dominantly inherited forms of LGMD. Importantly, the emergence of
   RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics in the last decade provided new
   tools to combat dominantly inherited LGMDs with molecular therapy. In
   this study, we describe the first RNAi-based, preclinical gene therapy
   approach for silencing a gene associated with dominant LGMD. To do this,
   we developed adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV6) carrying designed
   therapeutic microRNAs targeting mutant myotilin (MYOT), which is the
   underlying cause of LGMD type 1A (LGMD1A). Our best MYOT-targeted
   microRNA vector (called miMYOT) significantly reduced mutant myotilin
   mRNA and soluble protein expression in muscles of LGMD1A mice (the
   TgT57I model) both 3 and 9 months after delivery, demonstrating
   short-and long-term silencing effects. This MYOT gene silencing
   subsequently decreased deposition of MYOT-seeded intramuscular protein
   aggregates, which is the hallmark feature of LGMD1A. Histological
   improvements were accompanied by significant functional correction, as
   miMYOT-treated animals showed increased muscle weight and improved
   specific force in the gastrocnemius, which is one of the most severely
   affected muscles in TgT57I mice and patients with dominant myotilin
   mutations. These promising results in a preclinical model of LGMD1A
   support the further development of RNAi-based molecular therapy as a
   prospective treatment for LGMD1A. Furthermore, this study sets a
   foundation that may be refined and adapted to treat other dominant LGMD
   and related disorders.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the feasibility of performing noninvasive
   histotripsy therapy through an intact human skull cap. The ablation
   precision of the therapy using extremely short pulses was also
   evaluated. A 500-kHz 32-element focused hemispherical array was
   fabricated in-house; it can generate high instantaneous peak
   rarefactional pressures (p-) at the focus (theoretically over 100 MPa in
   free field) with pulses <2 cycles. The skull cap significantly decreased
   the p-value to approximately 14\% of free-field conditions. With timing
   corrections applied to 32 elements, focal pressure was restored to
   approximately 28\% of free field, allowing consistent cavitation
   initiation at the focus at an estimated p-of 29 to 30 MPa. Lesions were
   created in agarose tissue phantoms and ex vivo canine liver using PRFs
   of 1, 10, and 100 Hz, with a total of 500 histotripsy pulses applied.
   Main lesions as small as 0.7 x 1.6 mm (+/-0.1 x 0.1 mm) in the phantoms
   and 0.5 x 1.2 mm in tissue samples were generated transcranially.
   Results showed that treatments at lower PRF yielded lesions with more
   confined ablation and sharper boundaries. The capability of generating
   small, precise transcranial lesions could be potentially useful for
   noninvasive brain therapy applications at low frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete special moment frames (RC SMF) have been widely used
   as part of seismic force-resisting systems. Design methodologies and
   systematic procedures of RC SMF are needed which require no or little
   iteration after initial design in order to meet the targeted design
   objectives. This paper presents the first time application of the
   Performance-Based Plastic Design (PBPD) approach to RC SMF. The PBPD
   method uses pre-selected target drift and yield mechanisms as key
   performance objectives. These two design parameters are directly related
   to the degree and distribution of structural damage, respectively. Four
   baseline RC SMF (4, 8, 12 and 20-story) as used in the FEMA P695 were
   selected for this study. Those frames were redesigned by the PBPD
   approach. The baseline code designed frames and the PBPD frames were
   subjected to extensive inelastic pushover and time-history analyses. The
   seismic responses of the study frames met the targeted performance
   criteria with considerable improvement over the corresponding baseline
   code designed frames.}},

Abstract = {{Interannual variability of precipitation can influence components of the
   hydrological budget, affecting them directly and indirectly through
   adjustments in vegetation structure and function. We investigate the
   effects of fluctuations of annual precipitation on ecohydrological
   dynamics. Specifically, we use the advanced weather generator, AWE-GEN,
   to simulate 200 years of hourly meteorological forcing obtained by
   imposing four types of precipitation annual process with identical
   long-term mean. The generated time series force a mechanistic
   ecohydrological model, Tethys-Chloris. Simulations with perturbed
   precipitation variability are performed for four locations characterized
   by different vegetation cover and climate. The results indicate that
   long-term transpiration (T) and evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes as well
   as vegetation productivity expressed as Gross Primary Production (GPP)
   and Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) are essentially unaffected
   by the imposed climate fluctuations. This finding supports the
   hypothesis of a relative insensitivity, except for water-limited
   environments, of interannual evapotranspiration and vegetation
   productivity to annual climatic fluctuations, which are mostly reflected
   in the fluxes of deep leakage and runoff. The occurrence of short
   periods of favorable meteorological conditions randomly taking place
   within the year was found to be a better explanatory variable for
   interannual variability of ET and ANPP than average annual or growing
   season conditions. The results indicated that local, single-site
   sensitivities are considerably smaller than those observed across
   climatic and vegetation spatial gradients and thus an important role of
   ecosystem reorganization in modifying ANPP and ET sensitivity in a
   changing climate is recognized.}},

   fabrication of agent-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
   spheroids via the emulsion solvent evaporation (ESE) method. The
   versatility of this technique for loading a variety of therapeutics is
   demonstrated via loading of paclitaxel, bovine serum albumin, and
   cadmium sulfide nanoparticles into PLGA spheroids. The encapsulation
   efficiency for spheroids fabricated via oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions is
   highest at low aqueous phase surfactant concentrations while the
   encapsulation efficiency for spheroids made via water-in-oil-in-water
   (W/O/W) is highest at high aqueous phase surfactant concentrations and
   basic aqueous phase pH values. Particle aspect ratio polydispersity can
   be minimized via the use of high aqueous phase PVA concentration and pH.
   The ESE technique is an attractive alternative to recently described
   methods for fabrication of non-spherical particles due to its simplicity

Abstract = {{Materials combining high stiffness and mechanical energy dissipation are
   needed in automotive, aviation, construction, and other technologies
   where structural elements are exposed to dynamic loads. In this paper we
   demonstrate that a judicious combination of carbon nanotube engineered
   trusses held in a dissipative polymer can lead to a composite material
   that simultaneously exhibits both high stiffness and damping. Indeed,
   the combination of stiffness and damping that is reported is quite high
   in any single monolithic material. Carbon nanotube (CNT) microstructures
   grown in a novel 3D truss topology form the backbone of these
   nanocomposites. The CNT trusses are coated by ceramics and by a
   nanostructured polymer film assembled using the layer-by-layer
   technique. The crevices of the trusses are then filled with soft
   polyurethane. Each constituent of the composite is accurately modeled,
   and these models are used to guide the manufacturing process, in
   particular the choice of the backbone topology and the optimization of
   the mechanical properties of the constituent materials. The resulting
   composite exhibits much higher stiffness (80 times) and similar damping
   (specific damping capacity of 0.8) compared to the polymer. Our work is
   a step forward in implementing the concept of materials by design across
   multiple length scales.}},

Abstract = {{New multibit memory devices are desirable for improving data storage
   density and computing speed. Here, we report that multilayer MoS2
   transistors, when treated with plasmas, can dramatically serve as
   low-cost, nonvolatile, highly durable memories with binary and multibit
   data storage capability. We have demonstrated binary and
   2-bit/transistor (or 4-level) data states suitable for year-scale data
   storage applications as well as 3-bit/transistor (or 8-level) data
   states for day-scale data storage. This multibit memory capability is
   hypothesized to be attributed to plasma-induced doping and ripple of the
   top MoS2 layers in a transistor, which could form an ambipolar
   charge-trapping layer interfacing the underlying MoS2 channel. This
   structure could enable the nonvolatile retention of charged carriers as
   well as the reversible modulation of polarity and amount of the trapped
   charge, ultimately resulting in multilevel data states in memory
   transistors. Our Kelvin force microscopy results strongly support this
   hypothesis. In addition, our research suggests that the programming
   speed of such memories can be improved by using nanoscale-area plasma
   treatment. We anticipate that this work would provide important
   scientific insights for leveraging the unique structural property of
   atomically layered two-dimensional materials In nanoelectronic
   applications.}},

Title = {{A GIS based national assessment of algal bio-oil production potential

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{The high theoretical productivity of microalgae makes it a promising
   energy crop, but economically viable large-scale production facilities
   have yet to emerge. Coupling algae cultivation ponds with flue gas
   emissions from power utilities to provide carbon dioxide and municipal
   wastewater to provide nutrients has been recommended as a solution. This
   flue gas and wastewater co-utilization (FWC) strategy not only reduces
   the upstream impacts and costs associated with providing inputs, but
   also provides a credit for wastewater treatment, a service currently
   required to reduce production costs to a viable level.
   This study provides the first national assessment of the potential for
   producing algal bio-oil in the United States using FWC. Spatial-temporal
   algae growth was simulated using solar radiation and temperature data to
   calculate the average annual algae yield for any location, which
   significantly impacts feasibility. The results of this model were
   integrated into a geospatial analysis which establishes the economically
   viable bio-oil production potential of FWC by accounting for the
   relative abundance of the input resources and their proximity. At most,
   1.7 billion liters of bio-oil could be produced annually in a manner
   economically competitive with crude oil prices of \$80 per barrel. The
   amount of nutrients in wastewater limits yields to 20.5 L of bio-oil per
   capita annually, and climatic constraints further reduce this potential
   by nearly 60\%. Carbon dioxide constraints play a negligible role.
   Although the bio-oil production potential of FWC is relatively small, it
   does provide an opportunity to increase national biofuel output while
   providing a needed service. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Influence of micro-cracking on the composite resistivity of Engineered
   Cementitious Composites}},
Journal = {{CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECCs) are structural materials known
   for their excellent tensile ductility and damage tolerance. Previous
   experimental studies have shown a strong dependence of electrical
   resistivity of ECC on applied mechanical tensile strain (piezoresistive
   behavior), which can be potentially utilized for self-sensing mechanical
   damage for structural health monitoring. In this paper, the influence of
   micro-cracks on the composite electrical response of ECC under direct
   tension is investigated experimentally as well as analytically. For this
   purpose, the electrical-mechanical properties of two ECCs with different
   crack patterns are compared at macro (composite) and meso (single-crack)
   scales. An analytical model linking single-crack electrical response and
   crack pattern of an ECC to its composite electrical behavior is proposed
   in this study, and verified for both ECCs with experimental
   observations. Thus, a fundamental understanding of crack patterns and
   their effects on piezoresistivity of ECC is developed in this study. (C)

Title = {{Bridging the Research-to-Practice Gap: Designing an Institutional Change
   Plan Using Local Evidence}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAmple research provides evidence about the influence of
   effective teaching practices on student success. Yet the adoption of
   such practices has been slow at many institutions. Efforts to bridge the
   gap between research and practice are needed.
   PurposeWe describe an institutional change plan we developed to bridge
   this research-to- practice gap. Our plan is grounded in research and
   theories about faculty motivation and organizational change, and we
   designed it using local evidence from the University of Michigan College
   of Engineering.
   Design/MethodWe collected local data from three sources to provide
   context for our institutional change plan. First, faculty focus groups
   allowed us to determine factors that influence faculty adoption of
   effective teaching practices. Second, classroom observations allowed us
   to ascertain current teaching practices. Third, a student survey allowed
   us to identify teaching practices perceived by students to enhance their
   success. We used this local evidence with a who/what/how decision-making
   process to design our change plan.
   ResultsOur institutional change plan for accelerating the adoption of
   effective teaching practices comprises a faculty action plan and an
   administrative change plan. Although still evolving, there is evidence
   of the success of both parts.
   ConclusionsLocal evidence is critical in our change plan. Change agents
   wishing to bridge the research-to-practice gap at their own institutions
   can design a plan that adapts our process and integrates relevant
   research and theory with their own local data.}},

Title = {{Spatially and temporally reconfigurable assembly of colloidal crystals}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The self-assembly of colloidal crystals is important to the production
   of materials with functional optical, mechanical and conductive
   properties. Yet, self-assembly methods are limited by their slow
   kinetics and lack of structural control in space and time. Refinements
   such as templating and directed assembly partially address the problem,
   albeit by introducing fixed surface features such as templates or
   electrodes. A template-free method to reconfigure colloidal crystals
   simultaneously in three-dimensional space and time would better align
   work in colloidal assembly with materials applications. Here, we report
   a photo-induced assembly method that yields regions either filled with
   colloidal crystals or completely devoid of colloids. The origin of the
   effect is found to be electrophoresis of colloids generated by
   photochemistry at an indium tin oxide-coated substrate. Simple optical
   manipulations are applied to reconfigure these assembly and depletion
   regions. Thus, the method represents a new kind of template-free,
   reconfigurable three-dimensional photolithography.}},

Title = {{Optofluidic laser for dual-mode sensitive biomolecular detection with a
   large dynamic range}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a powerful method for
   biomolecular analysis. The traditional ELISA employing light intensity
   as the sensing signal often encounters large background arising from
   non-specific bindings, material autofluorescence and leakage of
   excitation light, which deteriorates its detection limit and dynamic
   range. Here we develop the optofluidic laser-based ELISA, where ELISA
   occurs inside a laser cavity. The laser onset time is used as the
   sensing signal, which is inversely proportional to the enzyme
   concentration and hence the analyte concentration inside the cavity. We
   first elucidate the principle of the optofluidic laser-based ELISA, and
   then characterize the optofluidic laser performance. Finally, we present
   the dual-mode detection of interleukin-6 using commercial ELISA kits,
   where the sensing signals are simultaneously obtained by the traditional
   and the optofluidic laser-based ELISA, showing a detection limit of 1 fg
   ml (-1) (38 aM) and a dynamic range of 6 orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Nanowires (NWs) have shown great potential for applications in flexible
   and transparent electronics. The main challenges lie in improving the
   transfer yield and reducing the cost of NW fabrication. Here, it is
   shown that a bilayer SiNW structure can spontaneously form during
   metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE). The bilayer structure formation
   is in turn accompanied by horizontal weak point formation that
   facilitates efficient nanowire transfer to diverse substrates. A
   mass-transport model is developed to explain the bilayer structure and
   horizontal crack formation effects. Significantly, these results allow
   repeated SiNW etch/transfer from the same Si wafer, thus potentially
   greatly reducing the fabrication cost of NW-based electronics. SiNW
   array-based transistors fabricated from two sequential etch/transfer
   processes using a single wafer are successfully demonstrated on Si and
   plastic substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced matrix packing density and tailored fiber-to-matrix interface
   bond properties have led to the recent development of ultra-high
   performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHP-FRC) with improved material
   tensile performance in terms of strength, ductility and energy
   absorption capacity. The objective of this research is to experimentally
   investigate and analyze the uniaxial tensile behavior of the new
   material. The paper reviews and categorizes a variety of tensile test
   setups used by other researchers and presents a revised tensile set up
   tailored to obtain reliable results with minimal preparation effort. The
   experimental investigation considers three types of steel fibers, each
   in three different volume fractions. Elastic, strain hardening and
   softening tensile parameters, such as first cracking stress and strain,
   elastic and strain hardening modulus, composite strength and energy
   dissipation capacity, of the UHP-FRCs are characterized, analyzed and
   linked to the crack pattern observed by microscopic analysis. Models are
   proposed for representing the tensile stress-strain response of the
   material. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust hourly cooling-load forecasting method
   based on time-indexed autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) models,
   in which the coefficients are estimated through a two-stage weighted
   least squares regression. The prediction method includes a combination
   of two separate time-indexed ARX models to improve prediction accuracy
   of the cooling load over different forecasting periods. The two-stage
   weighted least-squares regression approach in this study is robust to
   outliers and suitable for fast and adaptive coefficient estimation. The
   proposed method is tested on a large-scale central cooling system in an
   academic institution. The numerical case studies show the proposed
   prediction method performs better than some ANN and ARX forecasting
   models for the given test data set. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Parameter tradeoffs are explored and a design procedure is provided. Two
   different planar loop designs are presented. The first design yields a

Title = {{Reducing Peak Power Consumption in Multi-Core Systems without Violating
   Real-Time Constraints}},

Abstract = {{The potential of multi-core chips for high performance and reliability
   at low cost has made them ideal computing platforms for embedded
   real-time systems. As a result, power management of a multi-core chip
   has become an important issue in the design of embedded real-time
   systems. Most existing approaches have been designed to regulate the
   behavior of average power consumption, such as minimizing the total
   energy consumption or the chip temperature. However, little attention
   has been paid to the worst-case behavior of instantaneous power
   consumption on a chip, called chip-level peak power consumption, an
   important design parameter that determines the cost and/or size of chip
   design/packaging and the underlying power supply. We address this
   problem by reducing the chip-level peak power consumption at design time
   without violating any real-time constraints. We achieve this by
   carefully scheduling real-time tasks, without relying on any additional
   hardware implementation for power management, such as dynamic voltage
   and frequency scaling. Specifically, we propose a new scheduling
   algorithm FP Theta that restricts the concurrent execution of tasks
   assigned on different cores, and perform its schedulability analysis.
   Using this analysis, we develop a method that finds a set of concurrent
   executable tasks, such that the design-time chip-level peak power
   consumption is minimized and all timing requirements are met. We
   demonstrate via simulation that the proposed method not only keeps the
   design-time chip-level peak power consumption as low as the theoretical
   lower bound for trivial cases, but also reduces the peak power
   consumption for non-trivial cases by up to 12: 9 percent compared to the
   case of no restriction on concurrent task execution.}},

Abstract = {{Models of robotic bipedal walking are hybrid, with a differential
   equation that describes the stance phase and a discrete map describing
   the impact event, that is, the nonstance leg contacting the walking
   surface. The feedback controllers for these systems can be hybrid as
   well, including both continuous and discrete (event-based) actions. This
   paper concentrates on the event-based portion of the feedback design
   problem for 3-D bipedal walking. The results are developed in the
   context of robustly stabilizing periodic orbits for a simulationmodel of
   ATRIAS 2.1, which is a highly underactuated 3-D bipedal robot with
   series-compliant actuators and point feet, against external disturbances
   as well as parametric and nonparametric uncertainty. It is shown that
   left-right symmetry of the model can be used to both simplify and
   improve the design of event-based controllers. Here, the event-based
   control is developed on the basis of the Poincare map, linear matrix
   inequalities and robust optimal control. The results are illustrated by
   designing a controller that enhances the lateral stability of ATRIAS
   2.1.}},

Abstract = {{An image-based method has been developed for determination of
   particle-size distributions of coarse-grained soils in the 0.075-2.0 mm
   range. The percentage of fines is also determined. The test is referred
   to as sedimaging because it analyzes an image of a soil that has been
   rapidly sedimented through water to sort the particles by size. The
   sorting facilitates image analysis based on wavelet transformation. This
   paper details the sedimaging hardware, image analysis method, and test
   procedures. Parallel sedimaging and sieving tests on nine soils of
   different colors, gradations, and particle shapes showed nearly
   identical results. Sedimaging holds several advantages over sieving,
   including decreased testing time, lower energy consumption, less
   equipment maintenance, and improvement of the work environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a two-part architecture for a Knudsen vacuum
   pump with no moving parts. This type of pump exploits the thermal
   transpiration that results from the free-molecular flow in nonisothermal
   channels. For a high compression ratio, 162 stages are serially
   cascaded. The two-part architecture uses 54 stages designed for the
   pressure range from 760 to approximate to 50 Torr, and 108 stages
   designed for lower pressures. This approach provides greater compression
   ratio and speed than using a uniform design for each stage. Finite
   element simulations and analytical design analysis are presented. A
   five-mask single-wafer fabrication process is used for monolithic
   integration of the Knudsen pump that has a footprint of 12 x 15 mm(2).
   The pressure levels of each stage are measured by integrated Pirani
   gauges. Experimental evaluation shows that, using an input power of
   approximate to 0.39 W, the evacuated chamber is reduced from 760 to
   approximate to 0.9 Torr, resulting in a compression ratio of approximate
   to 844. The vacuum levels are sustained during 37 days of continuous
   operation. {[}2013-0138]}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, simulation, fabrication, and
   experimental characterization of high-performance piezoelectric
   diaphragm and cantilever beam out-of-plane micro actuators that are
   fabricated from bulk lead zirconium titanate (PZT) films integrated on
   silicon. The utilized fabrication technology involves low-temperature
   diffusion solder bonding of a bulk piezoelectric ceramic on silicon, and
   subsequent lapping to achieve a desired PZT thickness. Different
   piezoelectric actuation modes (conventional longitudinal and transverse
   modes, and a novel shear mode) are explored and compared in terms of
   displacement range, and the diaphragm structures and electrodes are
   optimized via finite-element analysis (FEA). The effect of bonding
   prestress on the device performance is analytically characterized and
   verified through measurements. The close match between test data and
   simulation results suggests that the piezoelectric properties of
   integrated bulk-PZT5A films are mostly preserved without any necessity
   of re-polarization. Fabricated devices are tested for dynamic
   displacement range, power consumption, and temperature response, and FEA
   is used to evaluate the actuation forces. A 25-mu m thick 1-mm(2) sized
   diaphragm can provide 12 mu mPP displacement at 111 kHz with <7 mW power
   consumption, while 1-3.5 mm long cantilever beams of similar thickness
   provide 0.1-1 mmPP displacement at resonance frequencies of 0.7-7.4 kHz.
   The introduced devices can be leveraged in various ultrasonic and
   acoustic applications. {[}2013-0133]}},

Abstract = {{In bone tissue engineering, the scaffold has not only to allow the
   diffusion of cells, nutrients and oxygen but also provide adequate
   mechanical support. One way to ensure the scaffold has the right
   properties is to use computational tools to design such a scaffold
   coupled with additive manufacturing to build the scaffolds to the
   resulting optimized design specifications. In this study a topology
   optimization algorithm is proposed as a technique to design scaffolds
   that meet specific requirements for mass transport and mechanical load
   bearing. Several micro-structures obtained computationally are
   presented. Designed scaffolds were then built using selective laser
   sintering and the actual features of the fabricated scaffolds were
   measured and compared to the designed values. It was possible to obtain
   scaffolds with an internal geometry that reasonably matched the
   computational design (within 14\% of porosity target, 40\% for strut
   size and 55\% for throat size in the building direction and 15\% for
   strut size and 17\% for throat size perpendicular to the building
   direction). These results support the use of these kind of computational
   algorithms to design optimized scaffolds with specific target properties
   and confirm the value of these techniques for bone tissue engineering.

Abstract = {{For most firms, especially the small- and medium-sized ones, the
   operational decisions are affected by their internal capital and ability
   to obtain external capital. However, the majority of the literature on
   dynamic inventory control ignores the firm's financial status and
   financing issues. An important question that arises is: what are the
   optimal inventory and financing policies for firms with limited internal
   capital and limited access to external capital? In this article, we
   study a dynamic inventory control problem where a capital-constrained
   firm periodically purchases a product from a supplier and sells it to a
   market with random demands. In each period, the firm can use its own
   capital and/or borrow a short-term loan to purchase the product, with
   the interest rate being nondecreasing in the loan size. The objective is
   to maximize the firm's expected terminal wealth at the end of the
   planning horizon. We show that the optimal inventory policy in each
   period is an equity-level-dependent base-stock policy, where the equity
   level is the sum of the firm's capital level and the value of its
   on-hand inventory evaluated at the purchasing cost; and the structure of
   the optimal policy can be characterized by four intervals of the equity
   level. Our results shed light on the dynamic inventory control for firms
   with limited capital and short-term financing capabilities.Copyright (c)

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{When facing heterogeneous customers, how should a service firm make its
   pricing decision to maximize revenue? If discrimination is allowed, then
   priority schemes and differentiated pricing are often used to achieve
   that. In many applications, however, the firm cannot or is not allowed
   to set discriminatory prices, for example, list price in retail stores,
   online shopping, and gas stations; thus a uniform price must be applied
   to all customers. This study addresses the optimal uniform pricing
   problem of a service firm using a queueing system with two classes of
   customers. Our result shows that the potential pool of customers plays a
   central role in the firm's optimal decision. Depending on the range of
   system parameters, which are determined explicitly by the primitive
   data, the firm's optimal strategy may choose to serve only one class of
   customers, a subset of a class of customers, or a combination of
   different classes of customers. In addition, the optimal price is in
   general not monotonic with respect to the potential market sizes because
   their changes may lead to a major shift in the firm's decision on which
   customer class to serve. However, unless such a shift occurs, the
   optimal price is weakly decreasing in the potential market sizes.}},

Abstract = {{In regenerative medicine approaches involving cell therapy, selection of
   the appropriate cell type is important in that the cells must directly
   (differentiation) or indirectly (trophic effects) participate in the
   regenerative response. Regardless of the mode of action of the cells,
   angiogenesis underlies the success of these approaches. Stem cells
   derived from tooth tissues, specifically the periodontal ligament of
   teeth (periodontal ligament stem cells {[}PDLSCs]), have recently been
   identified as a good source of multipotent cells for cell therapies.
   PDLSCs have demonstrated properties similar to mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs), yet, unlike MSCs, their vascular potential has not been
   previously demonstrated. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine if
   PDLSCs could modulate angiogenesis. In comparison to MSCs and stem cells
   derived from tooth pulp tissues (SHEDs), we first determined if PDLSCs
   released soluble proangiogenic factors with the capacity to induce
   vessel formation by endothelial cells (ECs). Next, the ability of PDLSCs
   to modulate angiogenesis was examined through their cotransplantation
   with ECs in subcutaneous sites of immunocompromised mice. Finally, the
   stability of the PDLSC-mediated vasculature was determined through
   evaluation of the maturity and functionality of the vessels formed
   following PDLSC transplantation. It was determined that PDLSCs produced
   appreciable levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic
   fibroblast growth factor-2, and additionally, were able to initiate in
   vitro angiogenesis of ECs comparable to MSC- and SHED-mediated
   angiogenesis. In vivo cotransplantation of ECs with PDLSCs significantly
   (>50\% increase) enhanced the number of blood vessels formed relative to
   transplantation of ECs alone. Finally, vessels formed following PDLSC
   cotransplantation were more mature and less permeable than those formed
   after transplantation of EC alone. These data demonstrate for the first
   time that PDLSCs have vascular potential, which could make them a very
   attractive cell population for utilization in regenerative cell
   therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Algae are an appealing source for bioenergy due to their high yields
   relative to terrestrial energy crops. The high cost of production,
   however, has prohibited commercialization. Hydrothermal liquefaction is
   a technology that converts more of the algae into oil than alternative
   technologies, thereby reducing the amount of expensive pond
   infrastructure and energy required for cultivation. We incorporate
   recent experimental results into an analysis that models the economic
   and life cycle performance of an algal biorefinery across a range of
   reaction conditions. Two strategies are explored: one pathway with
   gasification of the aqueous waste products for onsite energy recovery
   and another pathway featuring cultivation of Escherichia coli on the
   aqueous products and recycling of the biomass back through the reactor
   for boosted oil yields. We found that the maximum net energy ratio of
   1.9 and minimum global warming potential of 1.0 kg CO(2)e L-oil(-1)
   occurred with gasification, along with the minimum explored, 250 degrees
   C, and reaction times close to 1 h. The optimal economic and occupied
   land results occurred at temperature of 400 degrees C and with the
   shortest reaction time explored of 5 min. The cost of algal oil at these
   conditions was \$1.64 L-oil(-1) (or \$263 bbl(-1)). For the regrowth
   pathway, the land footprint could be further reduced by 10\%, and the
   optimal cost could be reduced to \$1.59 L-oil(-1). Forgoing gasification
   had a significantly detrimental effect on the other two metrics. Given
   the importance of economics to an algal biorefinery's operations, this
   could be a viable option.}},

Abstract = {{Collagen type I is a widely used natural biomaterial that has found
   utility in a variety of biological and medical applications. Its
   well-characterized structure and role as an extracellular matrix protein
   make it a highly relevant material for controlling cell function and
   mimicking tissue properties. Collagen type I is abundant in a number of
   tissues, and can be isolated as a purified protein. This review focuses
   on hydrogel biomaterials made by reconstituting collagen type I from a
   solubilized form, with an emphasis on in vitro studies in which collagen
   structure can be controlled. The hierarchical structure of collagen from
   the nanoscale to the macroscale is described, with an emphasis on how
   structure is related to function across scales. Methods of
   reconstituting collagen into hydrogel materials are presented, including
   molding of macroscopic constructs, creation of microscale modules and
   electrospinning of nanoscale fibers. The modification of collagen
   biomaterials to achieve the desired structures and functions is also
   addressed, with particular emphasis on mechanical control of collagen
   structure, creation of collagen composite materials and crosslinking of
   collagenous matrices. Biomaterials scientists have made remarkable
   progress in rationally designing collagen-based biomaterials and in
   applying them both to the study of biology and for therapeutic benefit.
   This broad review illustrates recent examples of techniques used to
   control collagen structure and thereby to direct its biological and
   mechanical functions. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Fibrin is the primary extracellular constituent of blood clots, and
   plays an important role as a provisional matrix during wound healing and
   tissue remodeling. Fibrin-based biomaterials have proven their utility
   as hemostatic therapies, scaffolds for tissue engineering, vehicles for
   controlled release, and platforms for culturing and studying cells in
   three dimensions. Nevertheless, fibrin presents a complex milieu of
   signals to embedded cells, many of which are not well understood.
   Synthetic extracellular matrices (ECMs) provide a blank slate that can
   ostensibly be populated with specific bioactive cues, including growth
   factors, growth factor binding motifs, adhesive peptides and peptide
   crosslinks susceptible to proteases, thereby enabling a degree of
   customization for specific applications. However, the continued
   evolution and improvement of synthetic ECMs requires parallel efforts to
   deconstruct native ECMs and decipher the cues they provide to
   constituent cells. The objective of this review is to reintroduce
   fibrin, a protein with a well-characterized structure and biochemistry,
   and its ability to support angiogenesis specifically. Although fibrin's
   structure function relationships have been studied for decades,
   opportunities to engineer new and improved synthetic hydrogels can be
   realized by further exploiting fibrin's inspiring design. (C) 2013 Acta

Abstract = {{A micromechanics model for fiber-reinforced composites that can be used
   at the subscale in a multiscale computational framework is established
   to predict the effective nonlinear composite response. Using a
   fiber-matrix concentric cylinder model as the basic repeat unit to
   represent the composite, micromechanics is used to relate the applied
   composite strains to the fiber and matrix strains by a six by six
   transformation matrix. The resolved spatial variations of the matrix
   fields are found to be in good agreement with corresponding finite
   element analysis results. The evolution of the composite nonlinear
   response is assumed to be governed by two scalar, strain-based variables
   that are related to the extreme value of an appropriately defined matrix
   equivalent strain, and the matrix secant moduli are used to compute the
   composite secant moduli for nonlinear analysis. The results from the
   micromechanics model are compared well with a full finite element
   analysis. The predictive capability of the proposed model is illustrated
   by two distinct fiber-reinforced material systems, carbon and glass, for
   the fiber volume fraction varying from 50 to 70 \%. Since fully
   analytical solutions are utilized for the micromechanical analysis, the
   proposed method offers a distinct computational advantage in a
   multiscale analysis and is therefore suitable for large-scale
   progressive damage and failure analyses of composite material
   structures.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{241}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{We developed a quantitative kinetics model for the homogeneous
   decomposition and gasification of indole in supercritical water at
   550-650 degrees C based on a reaction network with 17 separate reaction
   pathways. The model accurately describes the effects of time,
   temperature, and initial concentrations on the concentrations of
   intermediate products such as aniline, toluene, and benzene as well as
   the terminal gaseous products such as H-2, CH4, and CO2. Modeling
   revealed that three steps are most important for H2 production.
   Ring-opening of indole to form aniline is the fastest such step during
   the first few minutes at 600 degrees C, depletion of the large variety
   of gasifiable products dominates at times between 5 and 55 min, and
   water gas shift is the main H-2-producing reaction at longer times. The
   model also revealed that some of the potential pathways were kinetically
   insignificant at 600 degrees C. Such paths included methanation,
   gasification of benzene, steam reforming of indole, and formation of CO,
   CO2, and C2H6 from intermediate products. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This work quantifies the chemical kinetic and thermal effects of buffer
   gas composition on autoignition of three fuels at conditions relevant to
   engines, combustors, and experimental facilities used to study ignition
   kinetics. Computational simulations of autoignition of iso-octane,
   n-heptane, and of n-butanol were used to characterize the effects of
   buffer gas composition on ignition delay time and heat release rate.
   Stoichiometric mixtures, phi = 1.0, and a temperature range of 600-1100
   K were considered. Iso-octane and n-heptane were studied at initial
   pressures of 9.0 atm and 60.0 atm, and n-butanol was studied at initial
   pressures of 3.2 atm and 60.0 atm. Two dilution levels of buffer gas to
   O-2 of 3.76:1 (mole basis) and 5.64:1 were considered (similar to 21\%
   and similar to 15\% O-2 respectively, mole basis). The fuels and
   simulation conditions were selected based on the relevance to engine
   operating conditions and previously published ignition studies. The
   buffer gases considered were argon, nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide.
   Simulation results predicted changes of greater than a factor of 2 in
   ignition delay time and heat release rate as a function of buffer gas
   composition in the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region for
   n-heptane and iso-octane. Outside the NTC region, the predicted effects
   of changes in buffer gas composition were small (<20\%); however,
   experimental data for n-heptane indicate larger effects of buffer gas
   composition on ignition delay time at higher temperatures (>a factor of
   2). The heat release rates were also sensitive to buffer gas
   composition, with carbon dioxide exhibiting relatively high levels of
   early and late heat release relative to the other buffer gases.
   Sensitivity analysis of the third-body collision efficiencies for the
   buffer gases showed the effects of uncertainties in the third body
   collision efficiencies on ignition delay time and heat release rate. The
   results highlight the significance of buffer gas composition on
   low-temperature combustion chemistry, particularly via H2O2 and HO2
   decomposition and recombination reactions. (C) 2013 The Combustion

Abstract = {{A strong, naturally-occurring ``growl{''} combustion instability was
   studied for the case of a lean premixed prevaporized (LPP) combustor
   that shows great promise in reducing pollutant emissions. Phase-averaged
   particle image velocimetry (PIV) was applied for the first time to an
   LPP device to measure phase lags and spatial correlations. The extensive
   data set includes spatial and temporal correlations between six
   parameters: combustor pressure, plenum pressure, injection velocity,
   heat release rate (Rayleigh index), flame liftoff distance and flame
   centroid. Measured phase angles and time lags are consistent with the
   MIT model of Ghoniem et al., along with the concept of
   ``equivalence-ratio oscillation{''} discussed by Lieuwen et al.
   Frequency and phase data prove that a dual-mode Helmholtz resonance is
   driven by an equivalence ratio oscillation. One common modeling
   assumption is shown to be not valid; the length of an attached flame is
   not what is oscillating; instead the flame base oscillates violently due
   to periodic liftoff and flashback and this presents modeling challenges.
   Growl boundaries and the effects of varying some geometric lengths were
   recorded. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The introduction of oxygen in ZnTe provides an isoelectronic radiative
   defect that can form an intermediate band attractive for optoelectronic
   applications. ZnTe also exhibits native deep level emission in close
   spectral proximity to oxygen emission, which can obscure the
   understanding of these electronic states. The photoluminescence
   characteristics of ZnTe epitaxial layers on GaAs are studied with the
   intentional introduction of oxygen and native deep levels. Native deep
   level emission at 1.8 eV demonstrates a reduced quenching in emission at
   increasing temperature and dominates at room temperature. However, the
   overall radiative emission of oxygen states at 1.9 eV in ZnTeO is
   reduced in samples in which native deep level emission is present.
   Despite the radiative nature and weak temperature dependence of
   luminescence efficiency, oxygen incorporation demonstrates significantly
   higher radiative emission that is maximized with the reduction of the
   native deep level emission.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{889-893}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Highly mismatched ZnTeO alloys were grown by molecular beam epitaxy
   under various oxygen partial pressures (10(-7) Torr, 10(-6) Torr, and
   10(-5) Torr). Despite this large variation in oxygen partial pressure,
   there was almost no change in the concentration of incorporated oxygen.
   However, increasing the oxygen partial pressure significantly enhanced
   the photoluminescence of the oxygen-related transition at 1.9 eV. The
   evolution of lattice constants, as determined by high-resolution x-ray
   diffraction, appeared to follow Vegard's law for ideal substitutional
   alloys for ZnTeO films prepared at 10(-7) Torr and 10(-6) Torr, while a
   pronounced deviation occurred at 10(-5) Torr. Channeling nuclear
   reaction analysis further revealed the complexity of oxygen
   incorporation, as no significant shadowing was observed from the
   epitaxial films. The evidence suggests that the oxygen location in ZnTeO
   is more complicated than O-Te substitutional defects in a homogeneous
   solid solution, and that the configuration of the oxygen dopant might
   play an important role in the band structure and optical properties of
   the alloys.}},

Abstract = {{The two-wheeled inverted pendulum vehicle yields wide application
   prospects due to its compact construction, convenient operation, high
   maneuverability, and low fuel consumption. However, influenced by the
   underactuated characteristic, it is very difficult to achieve
   satisfactory control performances besides holding the vehicle body to be
   stable. In this study, based on the nonlinear dynamic model, the overall
   system is considered as three subsystems: rotational motion,
   longitudinal motion, and zero dynamics. Particularly, the tilt angle of
   the vehicle is treated as zero dynamics where the longitudinal
   acceleration is taken as the control input. With the control effects,
   the zero-dynamics subsystem could come up to be stable. Based upon the
   zero dynamics, the controllers for rotational and longitudinal
   subsystems are constructed in the following. In addition, the
   sliding-mode control techniques are used to derive the controllers since

Title = {{Multiplex Detection of Homo- and Heterodimerization of G Protein-Coupled
   Receptors by Proximity Biotinylation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Dimerization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represents a
   potential mechanism by which GPCR functions are regulated. Several
   resonance energy transfer (RET)-based methods have revealed GPCR homo-
   and heterodimerization. However, interpretation of an increase in FRET
   efficiency could be attributed to either dimerization/oligomerization
   events or conformational changes within an already
   dimerized/oligomerized receptor complex. Furthermore, RET-based methods
   can only measure pairwise dimerization, and cannot easily achieve
   multiplex detection. In this study, we applied proximity-based
   biotinylation for detecting receptor dimerization by utilizing a
   specific enzyme-substrate pair that are fused to GPCRs. The biotin
   ligase BirA is fused to CXCR4 and site-specifically biotinylates an
   acceptor peptide (AP) in the presence of biotin. As a test case for our
   newly developed assay, we have characterized the homo-dimerization of
   chemokine receptor CXCR4 and heterodimerization of CXCR4 with CCR2 or
   CCR5. The degree of biotinylation varies with the amount of GPCR-AP as
   well as biotinylation time. Using enzyme/substrate receptor pairs and
   measuring receptor biotinylation, we demonstrate that CXCR4 can
   homo-dimerize and hetero-dimerize with CCR2 and CCR5. The effect of
   CXCL12, agonist for CXCR4, was found to decrease surface biotinylation
   of CXCR4-AP. This effect is due to a combination of CXCR4 endocytosis
   and stabilization of CXCR4 homodimers. Finally, when CXCR4-AP, CCR2-AP,
   and CCR5-AP were expressed together, we observed CXCR4-CXCR4 homodimers
   and CXCR4-CCR2 and CXCR4-CCR5 heterodimers. The newly developed assay
   opens new opportunity for multiplex detection for GPCR homo- and
   heterodimerization within the same cellular context.}},

Journal = {{MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{726-746}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Bio-logging tags are widely used to study the behavior and movements of
   marine mammals with the tacit assumption of little impact to the animal.
   However, tags on fast-swimming animals generate substantial hydrodynamic
   forces potentially affecting behavior and energetics adversely, or
   promoting early removal of the tag. In this work, hydrodynamic loading
   of three novel tag housing designs are compared over a range of swimming
   speeds using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Results from CFD
   simulation were verified using tag models in a water flume with close
   agreement. Drag forces were reduced by minimizing geometric disruptions
   to the flow around the housing, while lift forces were reduced by
   minimizing the frontal cross-sectional area of the housing and holding
   the tag close to the attachment surface. Hydrodynamic tag design
   resulted in an experimentally measured 60\% drag force reduction in 5.6
   m/s flow. For all housing designs, off-axis flow increased the magnitude
   of the force on the tag. Experimental work with a common dolphin
   (Delphinus delphis) cadaver indicates that the suction cups used to
   attach the types of tags described here provide sufficient attachment
   force to resist failure to predicted forces at swimming speeds of up to
   10 m/s.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to detect light over a broad spectral range is central to
   several technological applications in imaging, sensing, spec-troscopy
   and communication(1,2). Graphene is a promising candidate material for
   ultra-broadband photodetectors, as its absorption spectrum covers the
   entire ultraviolet to far-infrared range(3,4). However, the responsivity
   of graphene-based photodetectors has so far been limited to tens of
   mAW(-1) (refs 5-10) due to the small optical absorption of a monolayer
   of carbon atoms. Integration of colloidal quantum dots in the light
   absorption layer can improve the responsivity of graphene photodetectors
   to similar to 1 x 10(7) AW(-1) (ref. 11), but the spectral range of
   photodetection is reduced because light absorption occurs in the quantum
   dots. Here, we report an ultra-broadband photodetector design based on a
   graphene double-layer hetero-structure. The detector is a
   phototransistor consisting of a pair of stacked graphene monolayers (top
   layer, gate; bottom layer, channel) separated by a thin tunnel barrier.
   Under optical illumination, photoexcited hot carriers generated in the
   top layer tunnel into the bottom layer, leading to a charge build-up on
   the gate and a strong photogating effect on the channel conductance. The
   devices demonstrated room-temperature photodetection from the visible to
   the mid-infrared range, with mid-infrared responsivity higher than 1
   AW(-1), as required by most applications(12). These results address key
   challenges for broadband infrared detectors, and are promising for the
   development of graphene-based hot-carrier optoelectronic applications.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of monochloramine disinfection on the complex bacterial
   community structure in drinking water systems was investigated using
   culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Changes in viable
   bacterial diversity were monitored using culture-independent methods
   that distinguish between live and dead cells based on membrane
   integrity, providing a highly conservative measure of viability. Samples
   were collected from lab-scale and full-scale drinking water filters
   exposed to monochloramine for a range of contact times.
   Culture-independent detection of live cells was based on propidium
   monoazide (PMA) treatment to selectively remove DNA from
   membrane-compromised cells. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and pyrosequencing
   of 16S rRNA genes was used to quantify the DNA of live bacteria and
   characterize the bacterial communities, respectively. The inactivation
   rate determined by the culture-independent PMA-qPCR method (1.5-log
   removal at 664 mg.min/L) was lower than the inactivation rate measured
   by the culture-based methods (4-log removal at 66 mg.min/L). Moreover,
   drastic changes in the live bacterial community structure were detected
   during monochloramine disinfection using PMA-pyrosequencing, while the
   community structure appeared to remain stable when pyrosequencing was
   performed on samples that were not subject to PMA treatment. Genera that
   increased in relative abundance during monochloramine treatment include

Abstract = {{In this letter, we report on the design, fabrication, and measured
   results of a directly heated phase change RF switch (or via) using
   germanium telluride in a four-terminal configuration. The switch is
   heated using a separate heater path combining the advantages of directly
   heated vias, such as low power dissipation for phase transition, and
   indirectly heated vias, such as high power handling capability. The
   phase change switch shows an insertion loss of less than 0.6 dB and an
   isolation of higher than 20 dB at frequencies up to 20 GHz, indicating a
   cutoff frequency of more than 3.7 THz. The switch area is only 4 mu m x
   6 mu m, which is smaller than RF MEMS switches with similar insertion
   loss performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
   on a four-terminal, directly heated, RF phase change switch.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of exponentially stabilizing periodic
   orbits in a special class of hybrid models-systems with impulse
   effects-through controlLyapunov functions. The periodic orbit is assumed
   to lie in a C-1 submanifold Z that is contained in the zero set of an
   output function and is invariant under both the continuous and discrete
   dynamics; the associated restriction dynamics are termed the hybrid zero
   dynamics. The orbit is furthermore assumed to be exponentially stable
   within the hybrid zero dynamics. Prior results on the stabilization of
   such periodic orbits with respect to the full-order dynamics of the
   system with impulse effects have relied on input-output linearization of
   the dynamics transverse to the zero dynamics manifold. The principal
   result of this paper demonstrates that a variant of control Lyapunov
   functions that enforce rapid exponential convergence to the zero
   dynamics surface, Z can be used to achieve exponential stability of the
   periodic orbit in the full-order dynamics, thereby significantly
   extending the class of stabilizing controllers. The main result is
   illustrated on a hybrid model of a bipedal walking robot through
   simulations and is utilized to experimentally achieve bipedal locomotion
   via control Lyapunov functions.}},

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of dynamic sensor activation for fault diagnosis
   of discrete event systems modeled by finite state automata under the
   constraint that any fault must be diagnosed within no more than K + 1
   events after its occurrence, a property called K-diagnosability. We
   begin by defining an appropriate notion of information state for the
   problem and defining dynamic versions of the projection operator and
   information state evolution. We continue by showing that the problem can
   be reduced to that of state disambiguation. Then we define the most
   permissive observer (MPO) structure that contains all the solutions to
   the problem, and we prove results showing that maintaining the
   K-diagnosability property is equivalent to satisfying the extended
   specification of the state disambiguation problem. We then prove a
   monotonicity property of the extended specification, and show that this
   allows us to reduce our information state, which in turn allows us to
   significantly reduce the complexity of our solution. Putting all of our
   results together, we obtain a MPO with a size complexity of O(2(vertical
   bar X vertical bar)(K + 2)(vertical bar X vertical bar)2(vertical bar E
   vertical bar)) compared with O(2(vertical bar X vertical bar 2.K.2
   vertical bar E vertical bar)) for the previous approach, where X and E
   are, respectively, the sets of states and events of the automaton to
   diagnose. Finally, we provide an algorithm for constructing the most
   permissive observer and demonstrate its scalability through simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Intracortical brain-computer interface (BCI) decoders are
   typically retrained daily to maintain stable performance.
   Self-recalibrating decoders aim to remove the burden this may present in
   the clinic by training themselves autonomously during normal use but
   have only been developed for continuous control. Here we address the
   problem for discrete decoding (classifiers). Approach. We recorded
   threshold crossings from 96-electrode arrays implanted in the motor
   cortex of two rhesus macaques performing center-out reaches in 7
   directions over 41 and 36 separate days spanning 48 and 58 days in total
   for offline analysis. Main results. We show that for the purposes of
   developing a self-recalibrating classifier, tuning parameters can be
   considered as fixed within days and that parameters on the same
   electrode move up and down together between days. Further, drift is
   constrained across time, which is reflected in the performance of a
   standard classifier which does not progressively worsen if it is not
   retrained daily, though overall performance is reduced by more than 10\%
   compared to a daily retrained classifier. Two novel self-recalibrating
   classifiers produce a similar to 15\% increase in classification
   accuracy over that achieved by the non-retrained classifier to nearly
   recover the performance of the daily retrained classifier. Significance.
   We believe that the development of classifiers that require no daily
   retraining will accelerate the clinical translation of BCI systems.
   Future work should test these results in a closed-loop setting.}},

Abstract = {{Background Yersinia pestis has caused at least three human plague
   pandemics. The second (Black Death, 14-17th centuries) and third
   (19-20th centuries) have been genetically characterised, but there is
   only a limited understanding of the first pandemic, the Plague of
   Justinian (6-8th centuries). To address this gap, we sequenced and
   analysed draft genomes of Y pestis obtained from two individuals who
   died in the first pandemic.
   Methods Teeth were removed from two individuals (known as Al20 and A76)
   from the early medieval Aschheim-Bajuwarenring cemetery (Aschheim,
   Bavaria, Germany). We isolated DNA from the teeth using a modified
   phenol. chloroform method. We screened DNA extracts for the presence of
   the Y pestis-specific pla gene on the pPCP1 plasmid using primers and
   standards from an established assay, enriched the DNA, and then
   sequenced it. We reconstructed draft genomes of the infectious Y pestis
   strains, compared them with a database of genomes from 131 Y pestis
   strains from the second and third pandemics, and constructed a maximum
   likelihood phylogenetic tree.
   Findings Radiocarbon dating of both individuals (Al20 to 533 AD {[}plus
   or minus 98 years]; A76 to 504 AD {[}plus or minus 61 years]) places
   them in the timeframe of the first pandemic. Our phylogeny contains a
   novel branch (100\% bootstrap at all relevant nodes) leading to the two
   Justinian samples. This branch has no known contemporary
   representatives, and thus is either extinct or unsampled in wild rodent
   reservoirs. The Justinian branch is interleaved between two extant
   groups, 0.ANT1 and 0.ANT2, and is distant from strains associated with
   the second and third pandemics.
   Interpretation We conclude that the Y pestis lineages that caused the
   Plague of Justinian and the Black Death 800 years later were independent
   emergences from rodents into human beings. These results show that
   rodent species worldwide represent important reservoirs for the repeated
   emergence of diverse lineages of Y pestis into human populations.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of 20 questions with noise for multiple players
   under the minimum entropy criterion in the setting of stochastic search,
   with application to target localization. Each player yields a noisy
   response to a binary query governed by a certain error probability.
   First, we propose a sequential policy for constructing questions that
   queries each player in sequence and refines the posterior of the target
   location. Second, we consider a joint policy that asks all players
   questions in parallel at each time instant and characterize the
   structure of the optimal policy for constructing the sequence of
   questions. This generalizes the single player probabilistic bisection
   method for stochastic search problems. Third, we prove an equivalence
   between the two schemes showing that, despite the fact that the
   sequential scheme has access to a more refined filtration, the joint
   scheme performs just as well on average. Fourth, we establish
   convergence rates of the mean-square error and derive error exponents.
   Finally, we obtain an extension to the case of unknown error
   probabilities. This framework provides a mathematical model for
   incorporating a human in the loop for active machine learning systems.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to compare the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   of two cellulosic bioenergy pathways (i.e., bioethanol and
   bioelectricity) using different references and functional units. It also
   aims to address uncertainties associated with a comparative life cycle
   analysis (LCA) for the two bioenergy pathways.
   We develop a stochastic, comparative life cycle GHG analysis model for a
   switchgrass-based bioenergy system. Life cycle GHG offsets of the
   biofuel and bioelectricity pathways for cellulosic bioenergy are
   compared. The reference system for bioethanol is the equivalent amount
   of gasoline to provide the same transportation utility (e.g., vehicle
   driving for certain distance) as bioethanol does. We use multiple
   reference systems for bioelectricity, including the average US grid,
   regional grid in the USA according to the North American Electric
   Reliability Corporation (NERC), and average coal-fired power generation,
   on the basis of providing the same transportation utility. The
   functional unit is one unit of energy content (MJ). GHG offsets of
   bioethanol and bioelectricity relative to reference systems are compared
   in both grams carbon dioxide equivalents per hectare of land per year (g
   CO2-eq/ha-yr) and grams carbon dioxide equivalents per vehicle kilometer
   traveled (g CO2-eq/km). For the latter, we include vehicle cycle to make
   the comparison meaningful. To address uncertainty and variability, we
   derive life cycle GHG emissions based on probability distributions of
   individual parameters representing various unit processes in the life
   cycle of bioenergy pathways.
   Our results show the choice of reference system and functional unit
   significantly changes the competition between switchgrass-based
   bioethanol and bioelectricity. In particular, our results show that the
   bioethanol pathway produces more life cycle GHG emissions than the
   bioelectricity pathway on a per unit energy content or a per unit area
   of crop land basis. However, the bioethanol pathway can offer more GHG
   offsets than the bioelectricity pathway on a per vehicle kilometer
   traveled basis when using bioethanol and bioelectricity for vehicle
   operation. Given the current energy mix of regional grids, bioethanol
   can potentially offset more GHG emissions than bioelectricity in all
   grid regions of the USA.
   The reference and functional unit can change bioenergy pathway choices.
   The comparative LCA of bioenergy systems is most useful for decision
   support only when it is spatially explicit to address regional specifics
   and differences. The difference of GHG offsets from bioethanol and
   bioelectricity will change as the grid evolves. When the grids get
   cleaner over time, the favorability of bioethanol for GHG offsets
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to analytically study the nonlinear
   dynamics of beam flexures with a tip mass undergoing large deflections.
   Hamilton's principle is utilized to derive the equations governing the
   nonlinear vibrations of the cantilever beam and the associated boundary
   conditions. Then, using a single mode approximation, these nonlinear
   partial differential equations are reduced to two coupled nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations. These equations are solved analytically
   using the multiple time scales perturbation technique. Parametric
   analytical expressions are presented for the time domain response of the
   beam around and far from its internal resonance state. These analytical
   results are compared with numerical ones to validate the accuracy of the
   proposed analytical model. Compared with numerical solution methods, the
   proposed analytical technique shortens the computational time, offers
   design insights, and provides a broader framework for modeling more
   complex flexure mechanisms. The qualitative and quantitative knowledge
   resulting from this effort is expected to enable the analysis,
   optimization, and synthesis of flexure mechanisms for improved dynamic
   performance.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach for evaluating predictions of oxygen
   saturation levels in blood (SpO(2)). A performance metric based on a
   threshold is proposed to evaluate SpO(2) predictions based on whether or
   not they are able to capture critical desaturations in the SpO(2) time
   series of patients. We use linear auto-regressive models built using
   historical SpO(2) data to predict critical desaturation events with the
   proposed metric. In 20 s prediction intervals, 88\%-94\% of the critical
   events were captured with positive predictive values (PPVs) between 90\%
   and 99\%. Increasing the prediction horizon to 60 s, 46\%-71\% of the
   critical events were detected with PPVs between 81\% and 97\%. In both
   prediction horizons, more than 97\% of the non-critical events were
   correctly classified. The overall classification capabilities for the
   developed predictive models were also investigated. The area under ROC
   curves for 60 s predictions from the developed models are between 0.86
   and 0.98. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of including pulse rate
   (PR) dynamics in the models and predictions. We show no improvement in
   the percentage of the predicted critical desaturations if PR dynamics
   are incorporated into the SpO(2) predictive models (p-value = 0.814). We
   also show that including the PR dynamics does not improve the earliest
   time at which critical SpO(2) levels are predicted (p-value = 0.986).
   Our results indicate oxygen in blood is an effective input to the PR
   rather than vice versa. We demonstrate that the combination of
   predictive models with frequent pulse oximetry measurements can be used
   as a warning of critical oxygen desaturations that may have adverse
   effects on the health of patients.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed study of the effects of hydrodynamic interaction (HI) and

   is observed that the deformation behavior at weak and intermediate shear
   rates is qualitatively similar to that observed for polymer chains in
   the absence of EV and HI, while that at high-shear rates is sensitive to
   modeling details and chain resolution. Our simulations with varying
   degrees of resolution reveal universality in chain behavior in the
   presence of EV (without HI), while the onset of the transition to a
   compressed chain in the presence of HI (without EV) shifts to higher
   shear rates with increasing chain resolution. The results also highlight
   the success of the bead-spring models in predicting the chain behavior

Title = {{Application of the level-set method to the analysis of an evolving
   microstructure}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{85}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Examination of three-dimensional microstructures and their evolution
   requires accurate quantification of morphologies. We developed a
   smoothing algorithm, termed ``level-set smoothing,{''} that smoothes a
   discontinuous or nearly discontinuous function that describes
   interfaces. The proposed method can be applied to any voxel-based data
   describing a two-phase structure. The level-set smoothing method is a
   set of sequential data-processing schemes that consists of first
   generating the signed distance function for the given microstructure
   using the level-set method, followed by smoothing via diffusion. This
   algorithm is designed to substantially reduce the artificial shift in
   the interfacial positions, as compared to simple smoothing methods, so
   that interfacial properties, including their rate of change, are
   accurately calculated. The accuracy of the proposed method is
   demonstrated by comparisons of the numerically calculated interfacial
   properties from data sets smoothed by the proposed method with their
   analytical solutions and of the interfacial locations of a complex
   microstructure from unsmoothed and smoothed data sets. Higher accuracy
   in calculating time derivatives of curvatures is achieved by using the
   advective method and choosing the time difference such that interfacial
   displacement is about two to three Cartesian grid points. (C) 2014

Title = {{A comprehensive framework to quantify energy savings potential from
   improved operations of commercial building stocks}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{459-472}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{While studies highlight the significant impact of actions performed by
   occupants and facility managers on building energy performance, current
   policies ignore the importance of human actions and the potential energy
   savings from a more efficient operation of building systems. This is
   mainly attributed to the lack of methods that evaluate non-technological
   drivers of energy use for large stocks of commercial buildings to
   support policy making efforts. Therefore, this study proposes a
   scientific approach to quantifying the energy savings potential due to
   improved operations of any stock of commercial buildings. The proposed
   framework combines energy modeling techniques, studies on human actions
   in buildings, and surveying and sampling methods. The contributions of
   this study to energy policy are significant as they reinforce the role
   of human actions in energy conservation, and support efforts to
   integrate operation-focused solutions in energy conservation policy
   frameworks. The framework's capabilities are illustrated in a case study
   performed on the stock of office buildings in the United States (US).
   Results indicate a potential 21 percent reduction in the current energy
   use levels of these buildings through realistic changes in current
   building operation patterns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Revisiting drivers of energy intensity in China during 1997-2007: A
   structural decomposition analysis}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The decline of China's energy intensity slowed since 2000. During
   2002-2005 it actually increased, reversing the long-term trend.
   Therefore, it is important to identify drivers of the fluctuation of
   energy intensity. We use input-output structural decomposition analysis
   to investigate the contributions of changes in energy mix, sectoral
   energy efficiency, production structure, final demand structure, and
   final demand category composition to China's energy intensity
   fluctuation during 1997-2007. We include household energy consumption in
   the study by closing the input-output model with respect to households.
   Results show that sectoral energy efficiency improvements contribute the
   most to the energy intensity decline during 1997-2007. The increase in
   China's energy intensity during 2002-2007 is instead explained by
   changes in final demand composition and production structure. Changes in
   final demand composition are mainly due to increasing share of exports,
   while changes in production structure mainly arise from the shift of
   Chinese economy to more energy-intensive industries. Changes in energy
   mix and final demand structure contribute little to China's energy
   intensity fluctuation. From the consumption perspective, growing exports
   of energy-intensive products and increasing infrastructure demands
   explain the majority of energy intensity increase during 2002-2007. (C)

Abstract = {{Graphical models are well established in providing meaningful
   conditional probability descriptions of complex multivariable
   interactions. In the Gaussian case, the conditional independencies
   between different variables correspond to zero entries in the precision
   (inverse covariance) matrix. Hence, there has been much recent interest
   in sparse precision matrix estimation in areas such as statistics,
   machine learning, computer vision, pattern recognition, and signal
   processing. A popular estimation method involves optimizing a penalized
   log-likelihood problem. The penalty is responsible for inducing sparsity
   and a common choice is the convex l(1) norm. Even though the l(0)
   penalty is the natural choice guaranteeing maximum sparsity, it has been
   avoided due to lack of convexity. As a result, in this paper we bridge
   the gap between these two penalties and propose the non-concave l(q)
   penalized log-likelihood problem for sparse precision matrix estimation
   where 0 <= q < 1. A novel algorithm is developed for the optimization
   and we provide some of its theoretic properties that are useful in
   sparse linear regression. We illustrate on synthetic and real data,
   showing reconstruction quality comparisons of sparsity inducing
   penalties: l(0), l(q) with 0 < q < 1, l(1) and SCAD.}},

Abstract = {{Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems are critical for monitoring
   aging infrastructure (such as buildings or bridges) in a cost-effective
   manner. Such systems typically involve collections of battery-operated
   wireless sensors that sample vibration data over time. After the data is
   transmitted to a central node, modal analysis can be used to detect
   damage in the structure. In this paper, we propose and study three
   frameworks for Compressive Sensing (CS) in SHM systems; these methods
   are intended to minimize power consumption by allowing the data to be
   sampled and/or transmitted more efficiently. At the central node, all of
   these frameworks involve a very simple technique for estimating the
   structure's mode shapes without requiring a traditional CS
   reconstruction of the vibration signals; all that is needed is to
   compute a simple Singular Value Decomposition. We provide theoretical
   justification (including measurement bounds) for each of these
   techniques based on the equations of motion describing a simplified
   Multiple-Degree-Of-Freedom (MDOF) system, and we support our proposed
   techniques using simulations based on synthetic and real data.}},

Abstract = {{Alkali metal atoms show an intense natural fluorescence in the burned
   gas region of internal combustion engines. This fluorescence offers
   great opportunity for spectroscopic combustion analysis in internal
   combustion engines without the requirement of laser excitation or image
   intensifiers. To quantify this fluorescence intensity, spectroscopic and
   thermodynamic properties of the alkali metals lithium (Li), sodium (Na),
   potassium (K), rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) and their oxidation
   products and ions were analyzed. Collisional energy transfer and
   reabsorption effects (including temperature- and pressure-dependent
   lineshapes) were calculated over the range of engine environments. Three
   compounds containing Li, Na and K, respectively, were selected as fuel
   additives for engine experiments. The experiments were conducted on an
   optical, single-cylinder, spark-ignited, direct-injection research
   engine, and the fluorescence of the three alkali components was recorded
   simultaneously using three complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor
   high-speed cameras. The two-component fluorescence intensity ratios
   (Na/K, Li/K and Na/Li) are shown to depend on temperature, pressure and
   equivalence ratio. However, the three-component ratio Na center dot
   Li/K-2 is nearly independent of pressure and equivalence ratio in the
   tested range of operating conditions and can serve as a direct marker
   for burned gas temperature. Subsequently, equivalence ratio can be
   determined from any of the bicomponent fluorescence ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional culture systems bridge the experimental gap between in
   vivo and in vitro physiology. However, nonstandardized formation and
   limited downstream adaptability of 3D cultures have hindered mainstream
   adoption of these systems for biological applications, especially for
   low- and moderate-throughput assays commonly used in biomedical
   research. Here we build on our recent development of a 384-well hanging
   drop plate for spheroid culture to design a complementary spheroid
   transfer and imaging (TRIM) plate. The low-aspect ratio wells of the
   TRIM plate facilitated high-fidelity, user-independent, contact-based
   collection of hanging drop spheroids. Using the TRIM plate, we
   demonstrated several downstream analyses, including bulk tissue
   collection for flow cytometry, high-resolution low working-distance
   immersion imaging, and timely reagent delivery for enzymatic studies.
   Low working-distance multiphoton imaging revealed a cell type-dependent,
   macroscopic spheroid structure. Unlike ovarian cancer spheroids, which
   formed loose, disk-shaped spheroids, human mammary fibroblasts formed
   tight, spherical, and nutrient-limited spheroids. Beyond the
   applications we describe here, we expect the hanging drop spheroid plate
   and complementary TRIM plate to facilitate analyses of spheroids across
   the spectrum of throughput, particularly for bulk collection of
   spheroids and high-content imaging.}},

Abstract = {{This report describes the effect of rhamnolipids (RLs), an amphiphilic
   biosurfactant produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, on the
   integrity and permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers.
   We measured the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and
   permeability of {[}C-14]mannitol across Caco-2 cell monolayers upon
   incubation with 0.01-5.0\% v/v RLs as a function of incubation time (30,
   60, 90, and 120 min). We also studied the recovery of RL-treated Caco-2
   cell monolayers upon incubation with Kaempferol, which is a natural
   flavonoid that promotes the assembly of the tight junctions.
   TEER of Caco-2 cell monolayers incubated with 0.01-5.0\% v/v RLs
   solution dropped to 80-28\% of that of untreated cells. Decline in TEER
   was associated with an increase in {[}C-14]mannitol permeability as a
   function of RLs concentration and incubation time with Caco-2 cells.
   Incubation of RLs-treated Caco-2 cell monolayers with normal culture
   medium for 48 h did not restore barrier integrity. Whereas, incubation
   of a RLs-treated Caco-2 cells with culture medium containing Kaempferol
   for 24 h restored barrier function indicated by the higher TEER and
   lower {[}C-14]mannitol permeability values.
   These results show the ability of RLs to modulate the integrity and
   permeability of Caco-2 cell monolayers in a concentration- and
   time-dependent fashion, which suggest their potential to function as a
   non-toxic permeation enhancer.}},

Title = {{Investigation of a bistable dual-stage vibration isolator under harmonic
   excitation}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This study explores the steady-state performance of a dual-stage
   vibration isolator, which is configured by a bistable oscillator and a
   linear oscillator. The potential force of the bistable stage comprises
   negative linear and positive cubic nonlinear stiffnesses such that the
   two restoring force contributions may counterbalance to minimize dynamic
   force transmission. By applying a first-order harmonic balance, it is
   predicted that the bistable dual-stage isolator may significantly
   outperform an equivalent pure linear dual-stage isolator. This
   conclusion is verified through a series of numerical investigations.
   Following a parametric study, design guidelines are detailed to achieve
   performance improvements. Then, the `valley' response, which is the
   special phenomenon of the bistable dual-stage isolator due to the
   counterbalance of the negative linear and positive nonlinear potential
   forces, is revealed and quantitatively explained. Numerical studies
   demonstrate the role of initial conditions, and it is shown that the
   likelihood of beneficial single periodic valley and intra-well responses
   for isolation purposes can be increased by greater bistable stage
   damping. Finally, a bistable dual-stage isolator prototype is developed
   and tested, and the numerical and experimental results verify the
   theoretical predictions.}},

Abstract = {{An effective, low complexity method for lossy compression of scenic
   bilevel images, called lossy cutset coding, is proposed based on a
   Markov random field model. It operates by losslessly encoding pixels in
   a square grid of lines, which is a cutset with respect to a Markov
   random field model, and preserves key structural information, such as
   borders between black and white regions. Relying on the Markov random
   field model, the decoder takes a MAP approach to reconstructing the
   interior of each grid block from the pixels on its boundary, thereby
   creating a piecewise smooth image that is consistent with the encoded
   grid pixels. The MAP rule, which reduces to finding the block interiors
   with fewest black-white transitions, is directly implementable for the
   most commonly occurring block boundaries, thereby avoiding the need for
   brute force or iterative solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
   that the new method is computationally simple, outperforms the current
   lossy compression technique most suited to scenic bilevel images, and
   provides substantially lower rates than lossless techniques, e.g., JBIG,
   with little loss in perceived image quality.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the fatigue behavior of laser welds in lap-shear
   specimens of non-galvanized SAE J2340 300Y high strength low alloy
   (HSLA) steel sheets is investigated based on experimental observations
   and a fatigue life estimation model. Optical micrographs of the laser
   welds before and after failure under quasi-static and cyclic loading
   conditions are examined. The micrographs show that the failure modes of
   laser welds under quasi-static and cyclic loading conditions are quite
   different. Under quasi-static loading conditions, the weld failure
   appears to be initiated from the base metal near the boundary of the
   base metal and the heat affected zone at a distance to the pre-existing
   crack tip, and the specimens fail due to the necking/shear of the lower
   left load carrying sheets. Under low-cycle loading conditions, the weld
   failure appears to be initiated from the pre-existing crack tips and the
   specimens finally fail from the ductile fracture through the lower left
   load carrying sheets. Under high-cycle loading conditions, the weld
   failure appears to be initiated from the pre-existing crack tips and the
   specimens finally fail from the kinked fatigue crack propagating through
   the upper right load carrying sheets. Finite element analyses of the
   laser welded lap-shear specimens with consideration of the weld bead
   protrusion were carried out to obtain the global and local stress
   intensity factor solutions for the main cracks and kinked cracks,
   respectively. The stress intensity factor solutions can be used to
   explain the kinked fatigue crack growth patterns under high-cycle
   loading conditions. The kinked fatigue crack growth model based on the
   global and local stress intensity factor solutions for finite kinked
   cracks obtained from the finite element analyses is adopted to estimate
   the fatigue lives of the laser welds. The fatigue life estimations based
   on the kinked fatigue crack growth model agree well with the
   experimental results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient vibration sources in many prime energy harvesting applications
   are characterized as having stochastic response with spectra
   concentrated at low frequencies and steadily reduced power density as
   frequency increases (colored noise). To overcome challenges in designing
   linear resonant systems for such inputs, nonlinear restoring potential
   shaping has become a popular means of extending a harvester's bandwidth
   downward towards the highest concentration of excitation energy
   available. Due to recent works which have individually probed by
   analysis, simulation, or experiment the opportunity for harvester
   restoring potential shaping near the elastic stability limit (buckling
   transition) to improve power generation in stochastic environments-in
   most cases focusing on postbuckled designs and in some cases arriving at
   conflicting conclusions-we seek to provide a consolidated and insightful
   investigation for energy harvester performance employing designs in this
   critical regime. Practical aspects drive the study and encourage
   evaluation of the role of asymmetries in restoring potential forms. New
   analytical, numerical, and experimental investigations are conducted and
   compared to rigorously assess the opportunities and reach well-informed
   conclusions. Weakly bistable systems are shown to potentially provide
   minor performance benefits but necessitate a priori knowledge of the
   excitation environment and careful avoidance of asymmetries. It is found
   that a system designed as close to the elastic stability limit as
   possible, without passing the buckling transition, may be the wiser
   solution to energy harvesting in colored noise environments.}},

Abstract = {{Online perception, behavior, and learning in complex domains require an
   intelligent agent to quickly and reliably access different types of
   knowledge. A cognitive architecture, therefore, must implement a diverse
   set of memories that are optimized for storing, accessing, and learning
   these different types of knowledge. In this paper, we describe a complex
   Soar agent that uses and learns multiple types of knowledge while
   interacting with a human in a real-world domain. Our hypothesis is that
   a diverse set of memories is required for the different types of
   knowledge. We first present the agent's processing, highlighting the
   types of knowledge used for each phase. We then present Soar's memories
   and identify which memory is used for each type of knowledge. We also
   analyze which properties of each memory make it appropriate for the
   knowledge it encodes. These include procedural, semantic, and episodic
   knowledge, all of which play critical roles in the agent's ability to
   learn and extend its capabilities. We conclude with a summary of our
   analysis, and conclude that a diversity of memory systems and knowledge
   are useful for supporting general, integrated intelligence. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The practical time-varying channel between a high-speed train (HST) and
   infrastructure has a single Doppler shift on each resolvable multipath
   in most cases. As a result, the HST channel can be modelled by only 2L
   parameters: L Doppler shifts and L complex channel gains. Based on this
   observation, we propose a novel channel estimation technique for
   orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems running on a
   HST, with the name PIece-wise Time-Invariant Approximation (PITIA). In
   PITIA, the HST channel is approximated by a bunch of time-invariant
   channels, whose channel impulse responses (CIRs) can be estimated
   through pilots. Variations of these CIR samples over time derive both
   Doppler shifts and complex channel gains, so the whole time-varying
   channel can be reconstructed. PITIA enjoys low computation complexity of
   O(NL) for N subcarriers. The optimal duration of time-invariant channels
   used to approximate HST channel is derived from both analytical analysis
   and simulations. Compared to basis expansion model (BEM) methods, PITIA
   uses fewer channel parameters with comparable modelling error, shows
   better normalized mean squared error (NMSE) performance under
   high-mobility and high signal-to-noiseratio(SNR) environments, and
   achieves comparable NMSE in low SNR regime. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general, exact, two-dimensional (2D) elastodynamic
   analysis of the response of laminated composite panels subjected to

   an impacted laminated panel is solved using an eigenfunction expansion
   technique. Several examples are studied by varying the laminate lay-up
   and length-to-thickness ratio. The distributions of transverse stresses
   in the through-the-thickness direction are further compared with two
   one-dimensional theories, classical lamination theory (CLT) and
   first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT), showing the inadequacy of
   these theories and the necessity to establish a benchmark solution for
   2D elastodynamics. The 2D elastodynamic theory that is formulated is

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Sensitivity vector fields (SVFs) have proven to be an effective method
   for identifying parametric variations in dynamical systems. These fields
   are constructed using information about how a dynamical system's
   attractor deforms under prescribed parametric variations. Once
   constructed, they can be used to quantify any additional variations from
   the nominal parameter set as they occur. Since SVFs are based on
   attractor deformations, the geometry and other qualities of the baseline
   system attractor impact how well a set of SVFs will perform. This paper
   examines the role attractor characteristics and the choices made in SVF
   construction play in determining the sensitivity of SVFs. The use of
   nonlinear feedback to change a dynamical system with the intent of
   improving SVF sensitivity is explored. These ideas are presented in the
   context of constructing SVFs for several dynamical systems.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{262}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{We propose a new level set model for representing multimaterial flows in
   multiple space dimensions. Instead of associating a level set function
   with a specific fluid material, the function is associated with a pair
   of materials and the interface that separates them. A voting algorithm
   collects sign information from all level set functions and determines
   material designation. To represent a general M-material configuration,
   M(M - 1)/2 level set functions need to be accounted for; problems of
   practical interest use far fewer functions, as not all pairs of
   materials share an interface, and level-set functions that coincide are
   grouped together. Under this model, regions of potential material
   ambiguity, i.e. overlaps or vacuum, are markedly reduced in size: in 2D,
   ambiguous regions are points, as opposed to lines in material-based
   level set models; in 3D, they are lines as opposed to surfaces. The
   model produces excellent results without the need for reinitialization,
   thereby avoiding additional computational costs and preventing excessive
   numerical diffusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM), also known as spark assisted
   chemical engraving (SACE), is an effective micro-machining process for
   non-conducting materials. Process modeling of ECDM, including spark
   generation and material removal, is not fully established however.
   Empirical estimation for discharge energy results in large prediction
   error of material removal and is hard to experimentally validate. In
   this paper, an experiment-based stochastic model for spark energy
   estimation is presented. Tapered tool electrodes were fabricated by
   electrochemical machining (ECM) to improve the consistency of spark
   generation. Energy of sparks was experimentally determined and fit into
   a two-component mixture log-normal distribution to reveal
   electrochemical characteristics of tool electrodes. A finite element
   based model was established to correlate spark energy and the geometry
   of removed material. Material removal was treated as heat transfer
   problem because electrical energy released by spark generation transfers
   into thermal energy on the workpiece, resulting in material removal due
   to thermal melting and chemical etching. Predictions of material removal
   by the model demonstrated good consistency with experimental results.

Abstract = {{We applied the non-equilibrium ab-initio molecular dynamics and predict
   the lattice thermal conductivity of the pristine uranium dioxide for up

   heat-current autocorrelation decay theory to decompose the lattice
   thermal conductivity into acoustic and optical components. The predicted
   optical phonon transport is temperature independent and small, while the
   acoustic component follows the Slack relation and is in good agreement
   with the limited single-crystal experimental results. Considering the
   phonon grain-boundary and pore scatterings, the effective lattice
   thermal conductivity is reduced, and we show it is in general agreement
   with the sintered-powder experimental results. The charge and photon
   thermal conductivities are also addressed, and we find small roles for
   electron, surface polaron, and photon in the defect-free structures and
   for temperatures below 1500 K. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We introduced haptic cues to the serial reaction time (SRT) sequence

   displacements to the resting fingers, expecting that the proximity and

   (finger-activated key-presses) would strengthen the motor memory trace
   in particular. We adopted the experimental protocol developed by
   Willingham (1999) to explore whether haptic cues contribute differently
   than visual cues to the balance of motor and perceptual learning. We
   found that sequence learning occurs with haptic stimuli as well as with
   visual stimuli and we found that irrespective of the stimuli (visual or
   haptic) the SRT task leads to a greater amount of motor learning than
   perceptual learning.}},

Abstract = {{Ti2AlC is a representative member of MAX phase materials, which are
   known to exhibit a unique combination of properties observed in
   conventional ceramics and metals. In this paper, experimental protocols
   for the high strain-rate compressive response (up to similar to 4700
   s(-1)) using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) is developed. The
   optimized specimen geometry for Ti2AlC, derived in this work, ensures
   dynamic equilibrium and minimizes dispersion in the transmitted pulse. A
   modification of the conventional SHPB experimental set-up involves in
   situ high speed imaging, which facilitates identification of real
   strains free of macroscopic crack artifacts. Characteristics of the high
   strain-rate response of polycrystalline Ti2AlC, associated deformation
   mechanisms and micro-scale origins are presented. The results show that
   Ti2AlC shows significant inelastic deformation and strain softening
   before fracture, even at very high strain-rates. Post-fracture
   microstructures are analyzed to determine dominant deformation
   mechanisms which reveal simultaneous coexistence of kink bands and
   delamination, grain-pullouts and trans-granular cracks induced by high
   strain-rate loading. These deformation characteristics - also active
   under quasi-static loading, are responsible for the exceptional damage
   tolerance of Ti2AlC and provide experimental evidence for high rate kink
   banding in MAX phases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate rectifying Schottky diodes fabricated using as-grown
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) ensembles, without removing the
   metallic SWNTs, for optoelectronic device applications. The SWNTs are
   contact by a low work-function metal through a high-bandgap
   charge-blocking layer (ZnO) resulting in highly-nonlinear
   current-voltage properties compared to control ensemble SWNT devices,
   fabricated without a charge-blocking layer, which show resistive
   behaviour. This significant improvement in diode behaviour is obtained
   by reducing source-drain leakage from the metallic SWNTs using the
   charge-blocking layer which channels charge transport via the
   semiconducting SWNTs. Moreover, we explore an alternative method of
   creating the charge barrier layer via oxidizing a thin film of Zn
   deposited on directly on the SWNTs which could potentially reduce cost
   and increasing scalability of this technique to obtain highly rectifying
   diodes from as-grown ensemble SWNTs. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical stimulation of the outer hair cell hair bundle (HB) is a
   key step in nonlinear cochlear amplification. We show how two-tone
   suppression (TTS), a hallmark of cochlear nonlinearity, can be used as
   an indirect measure of HB stimulation. Using two different nonlinear
   computational models of the cochlea, we investigate the effect of
   altering the mechanical load applied by the tectorial membrane (TM) on
   the outer hair cell HB. In the first model (TM-A model), the TM is
   attached to the spiral limbus (as in wild-type animals); in the second
   model (TM-D model), the TM is detached from the spiral limbus (mimicking
   the cochlea of Otoa(EGFP/EGFP) mutant mice). As in recent experiments,
   model simulations demonstrate that the absence of the TM attachment does
   not preclude cochlear amplification. However, detaching the TM alters
   the mechanical load applied by the TM on the HB at low frequencies and
   therefore affects TTS by low-frequency suppressors. For low-frequency
   suppressors, the suppression threshold obtained with the TM-A model
   corresponds to a constant suppressor displacement on the basilar
   membrane (as in experiments with wild-type animals), whereas it
   corresponds to a constant suppressor velocity with the TM-D model. The
   predictions with the TM-D model could be tested by measuring US on the
   basilar membrane of the Otoa(EGFP/EGFP) mice to improve our
   understanding of the fundamental workings of the cochlea.}},

Title = {{Mechanochemotransduction During Cardiomyocyte Contraction Is Mediated by
   Localized Nitric Oxide Signaling}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE SIGNALING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{317}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{Cardiomyocytes contract against a mechanical load during each heartbeat,
   and excessive mechanical stress leads to heart diseases. Using a
   cell-in-gel system that imposes an afterload during cardiomyocyte
   contraction, we found that nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was involved in
   transducing mechanical load to alter Ca2+ dynamics. In mouse ventricular
   myocytes, afterload increased the systolic Ca2+ transient, which
   enhanced contractility to counter mechanical load, but also caused
   spontaneous Ca2+ sparks during diastole that could be arrhythmogenic.
   The increases in the Ca2+ transient and sparks were attributable to
   increased ryanodine receptor (RyR) sensitivity because the amount of
   Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum load was unchanged. Either
   pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of nNOS (or NOS1), but
   not of eNOS (or NOS3), prevented afterload-induced Ca2+ sparks. This
   differential effect may arise from localized NO signaling, arising from
   the proximity of nNOS to RyR, as determined by super-resolution imaging.
   Ca2+ -calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and nicotinamide
   adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2) also contributed to
   afterload-induced Ca2+ sparks. Cardiomyocytes from a mouse model of
   familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy exhibited enhanced
   mechanotransduction and frequent arrhythmogenic Ca2+ sparks. Inhibiting
   nNOS and CaMKII, but not NOX2, in cardiomyocytes from this model
   eliminated the Ca2+ sparks, suggesting mechanotransduction activated
   nNOS and CaMKII independently from NOX2. Thus, our data identify nNOS,
   CaMKII, and NOX2 as key mediators in mechanochemotransduction during
   cardiac contraction, which provides new therapeutic targets for treating
   mechanical stress-induced Ca2+ dysregulation, arrhythmias, and
   cardiomyopathy.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular motor myosin teams up to drive muscle contraction,
   membrane traffic, and cell division in biological cells. Myosin function
   in cells emerges from the interaction of multiple motors tethered to a
   scaffold, with surrounding actin filaments organized into 3D networks.
   Despite the importance of myosin function, the influence of intermotor
   interactions on collective motion remains poorly understood. In this
   study, we used precisely engineered myosin assemblies to examine
   emergence in collective myosin movement. We report that tethering
   multiple myosin VI motors, but not myosin V motors, modifies their
   movement trajectories on keratocyte actin networks. Single myosin V and
   VI dimers display similar skewed trajectories, albeit in opposite
   directions, when traversing the keratocyte actin network. In contrast,
   tethering myosin VI motors, but not myosin V motors, progressively
   straightens the trajectories with increasing myosin number. Trajectory
   shape of multimotor scaffolds positively correlates with the stiffness
   of the myosin lever arm. Swapping the flexible myosin VI lever arm for
   the relatively rigid myosin V lever increases trajectory skewness, and
   vice versa. A simplified model of coupled motor movement demonstrates
   that the differences in flexural rigidity of the two myosin lever arms
   is sufficient to account for the differences in observed behavior of
   groups of myosin V and VI motors. In accordance with this model
   trajectory, shapes for scaffolds containing both myosin V and VI are
   dominated by the myosin with a stiffer lever arm. Our findings suggest
   that structural features unique to each myosin type may confer selective
   advantages in cellular functions.}},

Abstract = {{Several GaSbBi(As)/GaSb films were grown to investigate the effects of
   Bi on GaSb surface morphology and bulk composition as a function of
   growth conditions. Scanning electron microscopy of the surface shows
   several biphasic droplets consisting of Ga- and Bi-rich phases
   approximate to 1 mu m in diameter form on the surface. Some of these
   droplets exhibit more unusual features such as facets, sub-droplets, and
   droplet etching into the underlying film. Bi droplet coverage shows a
   direct increase with increasing Bi:Ga and Bi:Sb BEIP ratios. Rutherford
   backscatter and X-ray diffraction analyses of these films show Bi
   concentration of up to 12\% and a concurrently increasing unintentional
   As concentration of up to 9.3\%, suggesting the presence of a strain
   auto-compensation mechanism during film growth. Once Bi concentration
   reaches 10-12\%, Bi incorporation saturates, with excess Bi atoms
   instead accumulating in the droplets. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights

   based on carboxymethyl chitosan-graft-poly (N-isopropyl

   anticancer drug and anti-inflammatory drug were also investigated. The
   chemical structure of CMCS-PNIPAm-GMA and of their hydrogels was
   characterized by FT-IR and NMR. The effect of PNIPAm grafting
   percentage, pH and temperature on the swelling ratio of the hydrogels
   was studied, demonstrating the pH/temperature-responsive nature of the
   hydrogels. The morphology of the hydrogels before and after swelling was
   observed by scanning electron microscope. 5-Fluorouracil and diclofenac
   sodium as model drugs were encapsulated into the hydrogels in situ.
   Moreover, the effect of pH and temperature on the release of these drugs
   was discussed. The cytocompatibility of the macromonomer CMCS-PNIPAm-GMA
   and their hydrogels was studied with dog bone marrow mesenchymal stem
   cells by using Alamar blue measurement and Live/Dead assay kit. All the
   results indicated that these degradable injectable hydrogels are good

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{Gold (Au) deposited on CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides, prepared by the
   co-precipitation (CP) technique, was tested for oxidative steam
   reforming of methanol (OSRM) in the temperature range of 200-400 degrees
   C. An active uniform Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solution was found to be dependent
   on the Zr/(Ce + Zr) ratio and the calcination temperature of the
   support, where a ratio of 0.25 calcined at 400 degrees C efficiently
   performed Zr4+ incorporation inside the Ce4+ lattice to produce smaller
   ceria crystallites and higher surface area. The highest methanol
   conversion obtained was 92\% at 400 degrees C, while Hy and CO
   concentrations were observed at 16\% and 0.25\%, respectively. The
   variation in Au content significantly affected the Au particle size,
   where Au agglomeration appeared at the highest loading of 5 wt\%, while
   the 3 wt\% Au had optimum particle size at 21 nm, which was suitable for
   OSRM. When comparing the stability behaviors of the Au/CeO2 and
   Au/Ce0.75Zr0 25O2 catalysts at 350 degrees C, the solid solution
   supports had higher catalytic activity with a longer life-time and less
   coke formation via coke gasification, as the main factor of catalyst
   deactivation, than those of the Au/CeO2 catalyst. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Band structure calculations that incorporate impurity effects suggest
   that a band resonant state maybe formed in p-type CoSb3-based
   skutterudites by replacing Sb atoms with Sn dopant atoms. Such resonant
   states have the potential to greatly improve thermoelectric energy
   conversion efficiency by increasing the density of states variation near
   the Fermi level, thereby increasing the Seebeck coefficient at a given
   carrier concentration. Through transport measurements of the Seebeck
   coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and Hall
   coefficient, we show that a practical band resonant state is not
   achieved by Sn doping. Compared to undoped CoSb3, the dimensionless
   figure of merit (ZT) in Sn-doped CoSb3 is enhanced slightly at high
   temperatures to a value of 0.2, mostly due to a reduction in thermal
   conductivity. The Fermi level is calculated not to reach the band
   resonant state induced by Sn impurity atoms within the range of Sn
   concentrations examined here. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their inert property, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have drawn
   considerable attention; their biological application has recently
   expanded to include nanomedicine and neuroscience. However, the effect
   of AuNPs on the bioelectrical properties of a single neuron remains
   unknown. Here we present the effect of AuNPs on a single neuron under
   physiological and pathological conditions in vitro. AuNPs were
   intracellularly applied to hippocampal CA1 neurons from the mouse brain.
   The electrophysiological property of CA1 neurons treated with 5- or
   40-nm AuNPs was assessed using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.
   Intracellular application of AuNPs increased both the number of action
   potentials (APs) and input resistance. The threshold and duration of APs
   and the after hyperpolarization (AHP) were decreased by the
   intracellular AuNPs. In addition, intracellular AuNPs elicited
   paroxysmal depolarizing shift-like firing patterns during sustained
   repetitive firings (SRF) induced by prolonged depolarization (10 sec).
   Furthermore, low Mg2+-induced epileptiform activity was aggravated by
   the intracellular AuNPs. In this study, we demonstrated that
   intracellular AuNPs alter the intrinsic properties of neurons toward
   increasing their excitability, and may have deleterious effects on
   neurons under pathological conditions, such as seizure. These results
   provide some considerable direction on application of AuNPs into central
   nervous system (CNS).}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are applied to study the spreading
   behavior of a nanosized water droplet that contains freely moving
   Na+/Cl- ions subject to an imposed electric field parallel to a solid
   surface. Results show that the positive and negative ions move
   relatively freely in response to an applied electric field, whereas
   polar water molecules realign themselves. These localized behaviors of
   the ions and the polar molecules are affected by both the applied
   electric field strength and the ion concentration, which in turn
   determine the deformation and spreading of the droplet on a solid
   substrate. The presence of the freely moving ions causes the
   ion-containing droplet to spread differently from a droplet of pure
   water. In a weak electric field of 0.05 V/angstrom, a droplet of a lower
   ion concentration spreads asymmetrically and the spreading asymmetry is
   considerably smaller than that associated with a pure water droplet of
   the same size. In a stronger field of 0.1 V/angstrom, a droplet of a
   higher ion concentration spreads symmetrically and completely wets the
   solid surface whereas a less ionically conducting droplet undergoes an
   asymmetric-to-symmetric transition in spreading until it reaches
   equilibrium.}},

Title = {{Osmosis-Based Pressure Generation: Dynamics and Application}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes osmotically-driven pressure generation in a
   membrane-bound compartment while taking into account volume expansion,
   solute dilution, surface area to volume ratio, membrane hydraulic
   permeability, and changes in osmotic gradient, bulk modulus, and degree
   of membrane fouling. The emphasis lies on the dynamics of pressure
   generation; these dynamics have not previously been described in detail.
   Experimental results are compared to and supported by numerical
   simulations, which we make accessible as an open source tool. This
   approach reveals unintuitive results about the quantitative dependence
   of the speed of pressure generation on the relevant and interdependent
   parameters that will be encountered in most osmotically-driven pressure
   generators. For instance, restricting the volume expansion of a
   compartment allows it to generate its first 5 kPa of pressure seven
   times faster than without a restraint. In addition, this dynamics study
   shows that plants are near-ideal osmotic pressure generators, as they
   are composed of many small compartments with large surface area to
   volume ratios and strong cell wall reinforcements. Finally, we
   demonstrate two applications of an osmosis-based pressure generator:
   actuation of a soft robot and continuous volume delivery over long
   periods of time. Both applications do not need an external power source
   but rather take advantage of the energy released upon watering the
   pressure generators.}},

Abstract = {{Top-down analysis of virtual atmospheric mercury emission networks can
   direct efficient demand-side policy making on mercury reductions. Taking
   China the world's top atmospheric mercury emitter as a case, we identify
   key contributors to China's atmospheric mercury emissions from both the
   producer and the consumer perspectives. China totally discharged 794.9
   tonnes of atmospheric mercury emissions in 2007. China's production-side
   control policies should mainly focus on key direct mercury emitters such
   as Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and
   Inner Mongolia provinces and sectors producing metals, nonmetallic
   mineral products, and electricity and heat power, while demand-side
   policies should mainly focus on key underlying drivers of mercury
   emissions such as Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces
   and sectors of construction activities and equipment manufacturing.
   China's interregional embodied atmospheric mercury flows are generally
   moving from the inland to the east coast. Beijing Tianjin (with 4.8
   tonnes of net mercury inflows) and South Coast (with 3.3 tonnes of net
   mercury inflows) are two largest net-inflow regions, while North (with
   5.3 tonnes of net mercury outflows) is the largest net-outflow region.
   We also identify primary supply chains contributing to China's virtual
   atmospheric mercury emission network, which can be used to trace the
   transfers of production-side and demand-side policy effects.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{230-248}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{One of the challenges in the design and operation of a mixed model
   assembly system (MMAS) is the high complexity of the station layout
   configuration due to the various tasks that have to be performed to
   produce different product variants. It is therefore desirable to have an
   effective way of representing complex system configurations and
   analyzing system performances. By overcoming the drawbacks of two widely
   used representation methods (block diagrams and adjacency matrix), this
   article proposes to use algebraic expressions to represent the
   configuration of an MMAS. By further extending the algebraic
   configuration operators, algebraic performance operators are defined for
   the first time to allow systematic evaluation of system performance
   metrics, such as quality conforming rates for individual product types
   at each station and process capability for handling complexity induced
   by product variants. Therefore, the benefits of using the proposed
   algebraic representation are not only their effectiveness in achieving a
   compact storage of system configurations but also its ability to
   systematically implement computational algorithms for automatically
   evaluating various system performance metrics. Examples are given in the
   article to illustrate how the proposed algebraic representation can be
   effectively used in assisting the design and performance analysis of an
   MMAS.}},

Title = {{Nanotopographic Substrates of Poly (Methyl Methacrylate) Do Not Strongly
   Influence the Osteogenic Phenotype of Mesenchymal Stem Cells In Vitro}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{The chemical, mechanical, and topographical features of the
   extracellular matrix (ECM) have all been documented to influence cell
   adhesion, gene expression, migration, proliferation, and
   differentiation. Topography plays a key role in the architecture and
   functionality of various tissues in vivo, thus raising the possibility
   that topographic cues can be instructive when incorporated into
   biomaterials for regenerative applications. In the literature, there are
   discrepancies regarding the potential roles of nanotopography to enhance
   the osteogenic phenotype of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). In this study,
   we used thin film substrates of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with
   nanoscale gratings to investigate the influence of nanotopography on the
   osteogenic phenotype of MSCs, focusing in particular on their ability to
   produce mineral similar to native bone. Topography influenced focal
   adhesion size and MSC alignment, and enhanced MSC proliferation after 14
   days of culture. However, the osteogenic phenotype was minimally
   influenced by surface topography. Specifically, alkaline phosphatase
   (ALP) expression was not increased on nanotopographic films, nor was
   calcium deposition improved after 21 days in culture. Ca:P ratios were
   similar to native mouse bone on films with gratings of 415 nm width and
   200 nm depth (G415) and 303 nm width and 190 nm depth (G303). Notably,
   all surfaces had Ca: P ratios significantly lower than G415 films.
   Collectively, these data suggest that, PMMA films with nanogratings are
   poor drivers of an osteogenic phenotype.}},

Title = {{Nutrient loading and meteorological conditions explain interannual
   variability of hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay}},
Journal = {{LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{373-384}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We use geostatistical universal kriging and conditional realizations to
   provide the first quantitative estimates, with robust estimates of
   uncertainties, of the seasonal and interannual variability in hypoxic
   volume in Chesapeake Bay, covering early April to late October for 1985
   to 2010, and explore factors controlling that variability. Results show
   that the time when the hypoxic volume reaches its maximum has moved from
   late to early July over the examined period, but that there is no trend
   in the seasonal-maximum hypoxic volume itself. No significant trend was
   found in the timing of onset of hypoxia, but the end of the hypoxic
   period has moved from October to September. Including nutrient loading
   from the Rappahannock River in addition to the Susquehanna and Potomac
   Rivers is found to be beneficial for explaining the interannual
   variability of hypoxia. Overall, January to May total nitrogen loads
   from these three rivers, April to August southwesterly and northeasterly
   winds, and April and May precipitation explain >85\% of the seasonally
   averaged interannual variability in hypoxic volumes. Southwesterly winds
   affect hypoxia by increasing vertical stratification, while
   precipitation likely acts as a surrogate for nonpoint sources of
   nitrogen downstream from monitoring stations. The relative contribution
   of nutrient loading to the overall interannual variability suggests that
   28-35\% reductions in monitored nutrient loads may not be sufficient to
   achieve a corresponding reduction in hypoxic conditions as had been
   suggested in previous studies, at least in the short term.}},

Abstract = {{The overall goal of this work is to develop a numerical simulation which
   correctly describes a bacterial biofilm fluid-structure interaction and
   separation process. In this, the first of a two-part effort, we fully
   develop a convergent scheme and provide numerical evidence for the
   method order as well as a full 3D separation simulation. We use an
   immersed boundary-based method (IBM) to model and simulate a biofilm
   with density and viscosity values different from than that of the
   surrounding fluid. The simulation also includes breakable springs
   connecting the bacteria in the biofilm which allows the inclusion of
   erosion and detachment into the simulation. We use the incompressible
   Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations to describe the motion of the flowing
   fluid and cliscretize the fluid equations using finite differences. We
   use a geometric multigrid method to solve the resulting equations at
   each time step. We note that the use of multigrid is necessary because
   of the dramatically different densities and viscosities between the
   biofilm and the surrounding fluid. We investigate and simulate the model
   in both two and three dimensions.
   We also note that our method differs from several previous attempts of
   using IBM for modeling biofilm/flow interactions in the following ways:
   the density and viscosity of the biofilm can differ substantially from
   the surrounding fluid, and the Lagrangian node locations correspond to
   experimentally measured bacterial cell locations from 3D images taken of
   Staphylococcus epidermidis in a biofilm.
   In the followup article, we will present the results of the validation
   of this model and calibration to several experimental scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, a piezo-aeroelastic energy harvester using
   nonlinear aeroelastic behaviors is proposed, and their characteristics
   and performance are investigated. The energy harvester is modeled by a
   two-dimensional typical section airfoil. The nondimensional parameters
   of the harvester are introduced, and the nondimensional
   piezo-aeroelastic equations are formulated. For the piezo-aeroelastic
   analysis, the root-locus method and time-integration method are used,
   and the present method is verified with experimental and analytical
   results. The iterative method is introduced to calculate the frequency
   response functions of a nonlinear piezo-aeroelastic energy harvester.
   The aeroelastic characteristics of a linear piezo-aeroelastic energy
   harvester and the effects of parameters are investigated. The results
   show that the linear piezo-aeroelastic energy harvester can be used to
   generate electricity only at the vicinity of flutter speed. It is
   assumed that the nonlinear piezo-aeroelastic energy harvester has free
   play and cubic hardening in pitch. For free play, nonlinear aeroelastic
   results show that stable limit cycle oscillations are observed in the
   wide range of air speed below flutter speed when the frequency ratio is
   1.3, and unstable limit cycle oscillations are observed at air speeds
   over flutter speed when the frequency ratio is 0.3. For cubic hardening,
   unstable limit cycle oscillations are observed at air speeds below
   flutter speed when the frequency ratio is 0.3, and stable limit cycle
   oscillations are observed at air speeds over flutter speed when the
   frequency ratio is 1.3. Finally, the authors discussed how to use these
   aeroelastic responses for piezo-aeroelastic energy harvesting.}},

Abstract = {{The development of optimal control strategies for many stochastic models
   relies on the observed traffic intensity. However, implementation of
   such control strategies is often infeasible because of high operating
   costs induced by the fluctuations of traffic flows. In this study, we
   propose a framework for estimating and monitoring the traffic
   intensities of stochastic systems. The framework does not require
   knowledge of any input traffic statistics, and it allows us to
   adaptively estimate the intensity function over time and simultaneously
   detect its significant changes so that the control strategy can be
   adjusted accordingly without requiring high operating costs. Finally, a
   canonical queueing system with various types of input traffic is used to
   evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Copyright (c) 2012

   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

   are deposited on both flat substrates and 3-dimensional cylinders. Both
   the thickness and compositional profiles are fitted to a diffusion-based

   generalized and optimized for any copolymerization gradient through a
   confined geometry, thus allowing for broad applicability to other

Abstract = {{BackgroundAlthough cytosolic DNA degradation plays an important role in
   decreasing transgene expression, the plasmid degradation pattern remains
   largely unexplored.
   MethodsIllumina dye sequencing was employed to provide degradation site
   information for S1 and cytosolic nucleases. S1 nuclease provided a
   positive control for a comparison between the agarose gel method and
   sequencing approaches.
   ResultsThe poly(A) region between the -lactamase gene and the
   cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was identified as the most likely cut
   site for polyplex-treated cytosol. The second most likely site, at the
   5' end of the -lactamase gene, was identified by gel electrophoresis and
   sequencing. Additional sites were detected in the OriC region, the
   SV40/poly(A) region, the luciferase gene and the CMV promoter. Sequence
   analysis of plasmid treated with cytosol from control cells showed the
   greatest cut activity in the OriC region, the -lactamase gene and the
   poly(A) region following the luciferase gene. Additional regions of cut
   activity include the SV40 promoter and the -lactamase poly(A)
   termination sequence. Both cytosolic nucleases and the S1 nuclease
   showed substantial activity at the bacterial origin of replication
   (OriC).
   ConclusionsHigh-throughput plasmid sequencing revealed regions of the
   luciferase plasmid DNA sequence that are sensitive to cytosolic nuclease
   degradation. This provides new targets for improving plasmid and/or
   polymer design to optimize the likelihood of protein expression.

Abstract = {{Detailed direct simulation Monte Carlo/particle-in-cell simulations
   involving the interaction of spacecraft thruster plumes with the

   rocket exit conditions of a neutral propellant species for use in the
   simulations. The charge exchange interactions of the steady plume with
   the rarefied ionosphere are modeled using a direct simulation Monte
   Carlo/particle-in-cell methodology, allowing for a detailed assessment
   of nonequilibrium collisional and plasma-related phenomena relevant for
   these conditions. Results are presented for both ram-and wake-flow
   configurations, in which the thrusters are firing into (ram) or in the
   direction of (wake) the free stream ionosphere flow in LEO. The
   influence of the Earth's magnetic field on the development of the ion
   plume is also examined for three different field strengths: two limiting
   cases in which B. 0 and B. 8, and the LEO case in which B = 0.5 Gs. The
   magnetic field is found to have a substantial impact on the resulting
   neutral and ion plumes, and the gyroscopic motion of the magnetized ions
   results in a broadening of the ion energy distribution functions. The
   magnetic field model also incorporates a cross-field diffusion mechanism
   which is shown to increase the current density sampled far from the

Title = {{Role of the blocking capacitor in control of ion energy distributions in
   pulsed capacitively coupled plasmas sustained in Ar/CF4/O-2}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In plasma etching for microelectronics fabrication, the quality of the
   process is in large part determined by the ability to control the ion
   energy distribution (IED) onto the wafer. To achieve this control, dual
   frequency capacitively coupled plasmas (DF-CCPs) have been developed
   with the goal of separately controlling the magnitude of the fluxes of
   ions and radicals with the high frequency (HF) and the shape of the IED
   with the low frequency (LF). In steady state operation, plasma
   properties are determined by a real time balance between electron
   sources and losses. As such, for a given geometry, pressure, and
   frequency of operation, the latitude for controlling the IED may be
   limited. Pulsed power is one technique being investigated to provide
   additional degrees of freedom to control the IED. In one configuration
   of a DF-CCP, the HF power is applied to the upper electrode and LF power
   is applied to the lower electrode which is serially connected to a
   blocking capacitor (BC) which generates a self dc-bias. In the steady
   state, the value of the dc-bias is, in fact, constant. During pulsed
   operation, however, there may be time modulation of the dc-bias which
   provides an additional means to control the IED. In this paper, IEDs to
   the wafer in pulsed DF-CCPs sustained in Ar/CF4/O-2 are discussed with
   results from a two-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model. The IED can
   be manipulated depending on whether the LF or HF power is pulsed. The
   dynamic range of the control can be tuned by the dc-bias generated on
   the substrate, whose time variation depends on the size of the BC during
   pulsed operation. It was found that high energy ions can be
   preferentially produced when pulsing the HF power and low energy ions
   are preferentially produced when pulsing the LF power. A smaller BC
   value which allows the bias to follow the change in charged particle
   fluxes produces a larger dynamic range with which to control IEDs. (C)

Title = {{Triclosan Promotes Staphylococcus aureus Nasal Colonization}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{The biocide triclosan is used in many personal care products, including
   toothpastes, soaps, clothing, and medical equipment. Consequently, it is
   present as a contaminant in the environment and has been detected in
   some human fluids, including serum, urine, and milk. Staphylococcus
   aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the noses and throats
   of approximately 30\% of the population. Colonization with S. aureus is
   known to be a risk factor for several types of infection. Here we
   demonstrate that triclosan is commonly found in the nasal secretions of
   healthy adults and the presence of triclosan trends positively with
   nasal colonization by S. aureus. We demonstrate that triclosan can
   promote the binding of S. aureus to host proteins such as collagen,
   fibronectin, and keratin, as well as inanimate surfaces such as plastic
   and glass. Lastly, triclosan-exposed rats are more susceptible to nasal
   colonization with S. aureus. These data reveal a novel factor that
   influences the ability of S. aureus to bind surfaces and alters S.
   aureus nasal colonization.
   IMPORTANCE Triclosan has been used as a biocide for over 40 years, but
   the broader effects that it has on the human microbiome have not been
   investigated. We demonstrate that triclosan is present in nasal
   secretions of a large portion of a test population and its presence
   correlates with Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization. Triclosan also
   promotes the binding of S. aureus to human proteins and increases the
   susceptibility of rats to nasal colonization by S. aureus. These
   findings are significant because S. aureus colonization is a known risk
   factor for the development of several types of infections. Our data
   demonstrate the unintended consequences of unregulated triclosan use and
   contribute to the growing body of research demonstrating inadvertent
   effects of triclosan on the environment and human health.}},

Abstract = {{Concave nanoparticles (NPs) with complex angled and non-Platonic
   geometries have unique optical, magnetic, catalytic, and biological
   properties originating from the singularities of the electrical field in
   apexes and craters. Preparation of such particles with a uniform
   size/shape and core-shell morphology represents a significant challenge,
   largely because of the poor knowledge of their formation mechanism.
   Here, this challenge is addressed and a study of the mechanism of their
   formation is presented for a case of complex spiky morphologiesthat led
   us to the conclusion that NPs with concave geometries can be, in fact,
   supraparticles (SPs) produced via the self-assembly of smaller convex
   integrants. This mechanism is exemplified by the vivid case of spiky SPs
   formed via the attachment of small and faceted Au NPs on smooth
   Au-coated iron oxide (Fe3O4@Au) seeds. The theoretical calculations of
   energies of primary interactionselectrostatic repulsion and van-der
   Waals repulsion, elaborated for this complex caseconfirm experimental
   observation and the self-limiting mechanism of SP formation. Besides
   demonstrating the mechanistic aspects of synthesis of NPs with complex
   geometries, this work also uncovers a facile approach for preparation of
   concave magnetoplasmonic particles. When combined with a spiky geometry,
   such bi-functional magnetoplasmonic SPs can serve as a unique platform
   for optoelectronic devices and biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of micro/nanoengineered functional biomaterials in
   the last two decades has empowered materials scientists and bioengineers
   to precisely control different aspects of the in vitro cell
   microenvironment. Following a philosophy of reductionism, many studies
   using synthetic functional biomaterials have revealed instructive roles
   of individual extracellular biophysical and biochemical cues in
   regulating cellular behaviors. Development of integrated
   micro/nanoengineered functional biomaterials to study complex and
   emergent biological phenomena has also thrived rapidly in recent years,
   revealing adaptive and integrated cellular behaviors closely relevant to
   human physiological and pathological conditions. Working at the
   interface between materials science and engineering, biology, and
   medicine, we are now at the beginning of a great exploration using
   micro/nanoengineered functional biomaterials for both fundamental
   biology study and clinical and biomedical applications such as
   regenerative medicine and drug screening. In this review, an overview of
   state of the art micro/nanoengineered functional biomaterials that can
   control precisely individual aspects of cell-microenvironment
   interactions is presented and they are highlighted them as
   well-controlled platforms for mechanistic studies of mechano-sensitive
   and -responsive cellular behaviors and integrative biology research. The
   recent exciting trend where micro/nanoengineered biomaterials are
   integrated into miniaturized biological and biomimetic systems for
   dynamic multiparametric microenvironmental control of emergent and
   integrated cellular behaviors is also discussed. The impact of
   integrated micro/nanoengineered functional biomaterials for future in
   vitro studies of regenerative medicine, cell biology, as well as human
   development and disease models are discussed.}},

   annealing: An in situ TEM investigation}},
Journal = {{CHINESE PHYSICS B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The microstructural evolution of zircaloy-4 was studied, including the
   amorphization and recrystallization of Zr(Fe, Cr)(2) precipitates, and
   the density of dislocations under in situ Ne ion irradiation and post
   annealing. The results show that irradiation at a relatively high
   temperature and dose induces the formation of nanocrystals in
   pre-amorphized Zr(Fe, Cr)(2) precipitates. The recrystallized
   nanocrystals also have the structure of hcp-Zr(Fe, Cr)(2). The formation
   of the nanocrystals is thought to be the consequence of competition
   between atomistic disordering and the recrystallization of precipitates
   under ion irradiation. The free energy of the nanocrystal is lower than
   that of the amorphous state, which is another reason for the
   recrystallization of the precipitates. With increased annealing
   temperature, the density of the nanocrystals is increased. The
   dislocation density sharply decreases with the increase in the annealing
   temperature, and its size increases.}},

Title = {{Prediction and Clustering in Signed Networks: A Local to Global
   Perspective}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The study of social networks is a burgeoning research area. However,
   most existing work is on networks that simply encode whether
   relationships exist or not. In contrast, relationships in signed
   networks can be positive ({''}like{''}, ``trust{''}) or negative
   ({''}dislike{''}, ``distrust{''}). The theory of social balance shows
   that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that, in
   turn, induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit
   both local as well as global aspects of social balance theory for two
   fundamental problems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction
   and clustering. Local patterns of social balance have been used in the
   past for sign prediction. We define more general measures of social
   imbalance (MOIs) based on l-cycles in the network and give a simple sign
   prediction rule. Interestingly, by examining measures of social
   imbalance, we show that the classic Katz measure, which is used widely
   in unsigned link prediction, also has a balance theoretic interpretation
   when applied to signed networks. Motivated by the global structure of
   balanced networks, we propose an effective low rank modeling approach
   for both sign prediction and clustering. We provide theoretical
   performance guarantees for our low-rank matrix completion approach via
   convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem sizes using a matrix
   factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive experimental
   validation including comparisons with local approaches. Our experimental
   results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint of social
   balance, we get significant performance and computational gains in
   prediction and clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore
   highlights the usefulness of the global aspect of balance theory for the
   analysis of signed networks.}},

   ventilation shaft exhausts under neutral atmospheric stability}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the roles of atmospheric wind profiles in the
   neutral atmosphere and surface roughness parameters in a complex terrain
   were examined to determine their impacts on radon (Rn-222) dispersion
   from an actual uranium mine ventilation shaft. Simulations were
   completed on Rn-222 dispersion extending from the shaft to a vulnerable
   distance, near the location of an occupied farmhouse. The eight
   dispersion scenarios for the ventilation shaft source included four
   downwind velocities (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 m s(-1)) and two underlying
   surface roughness characteristics (0.1 m and 1.0 m). Rn-222
   distributions and elevated pollution regions were identified. Effective
   dose estimation methods involving a historical weighting of wind speeds
   in the direction of interest coupled to the complex dispersion model
   were proposed. Using this approach, the radiation effects on the
   residents assumed to be outside at the location of the farm house 250 m
   downwind from the ventilation shaft outlet were computed. The maximum
   effective dose rate calculated for the residents at the outside of the
   farm house was 2.2 mSv y(-1), which is less than the low limit action
   level of 3-10 mSv y(-1) recommended by the International Commission on
   Radiological Protection (ICRP) occupational exposure action level for
   radon. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The shear-wave velocity and associated small-strain shear modulus of
   municipal solid waste (MSW) are important engineering parameters in
   evaluating the seismic response of MSW landfills as well as in
   characterizing the waste material and its response to static loads.
   Semiempirical and empirical models for the shear-wave velocity are
   presented. The semiempirical model is a more comprehensive model that
   aims to separately capture the effect of waste density and confining
   stress on the shear-wave velocity of MSW. It is based on similar models
   for soils, and its mathematical expression is formulated using data
   generated from large-scale laboratory studies on reconstituted MSW. The
   empirical model has a simpler mathematical expression that is a function
   of depth only. The parameters of both models are derived by calibrating
   them against a total of 49 in situ shear-wave velocity profiles at 19
   MSW landfills, i.e., 13 profiles from four landfills in Michigan
   generated as part of this study and 36 additional shear-wave velocity
   profiles from 15 landfills available in the literature. The models can
   be used to estimate the shear-wave velocity of MSW and to evaluate the
   seismic response of landfills. Also, in the absence of in situ data, the
   models can be used at existing MSW landfills for preliminary design
   purposes. The models are not intended to replace in situ data and do not
   predict abrupt changes in the shear-wave velocity profile as a result of
   abrupt changes in waste type and composition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a very general class of customer-to-resource
   assignment problems relevant to a variety of manufacturing contexts.
   This problem class addresses settings in which subsets of customer types
   share resource capacities as well as a fixed amount of capacity
   consumption, independent of production volume. More broadly, our model
   addresses cross-facility production limits and shared capacity
   consumption within each customer type. To solve these large-scale
   optimization problems, we apply a branch-and-price solution approach.
   This approach relies on an effective solution method for a novel class
   of nonlinear knapsack pricing problems. As our computational results
   demonstrate, despite the fact that the resulting master problem is not a
   simple set-partitioning problem, the problem's relaxation is
   sufficiently tight to produce an algorithm that significantly
   outperforms CPLEX for a wide range of problem parameter settings.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are low frequency cells found in the
   blood stream after having been shed from a primary tumor. These cells
   are research targets because of the information they may potentially
   provide about both an individual cancer as well as the mechanisms
   through which cancer spreads in the process of metastasis. Established
   technologies exist for CTC isolation, but the recent progress and future
   of this field lie in nanomaterials. In this review, we provide
   perspective into historical CTC capture as well as current research
   being conducted, emphasizing the significance of the materials being
   used to fabricate these devices. The modern investigation into CTCs
   initially featured techniques that have since been commercialized. A
   major innovation in the field was the development of a microfluidic
   capture device, first fabricated in silicon and followed up with glass
   and thermopolymer devices. We then specifically highlight the
   technologies incorporating magnetic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes,
   nanowires, nanopillars, nanofibers, and nanoroughened surfaces, graphene
   oxide and their fabrication methods. The nanoscale provides a new set of
   tools that has the potential to overcome current limitations associated
   with CTC capture and analysis. We believe the current trajectory of the
   field is in the direction of nanomaterials, allowing the improvements
   necessary to further CTC research.}},
