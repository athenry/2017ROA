Abstract = {{Recent modifications to the University of Michigan rapid compression
   facility (UM RCF) were made to allow direct imaging of
   fiame/autoignition interactions using compression to initiate
   autoignition chemistry and a spark plug to initiate simultaneous flame
   development. The experimental data in this study quantify the effects of
   spark-initiated flame propagation on autoignition of
   iso-octane/O-2/inert gas mixtures at well-defined initial conditions.
   The work leveraged the controlled environment of the UM RCF, in which
   temperature, pressure, and composition are nominally uniform and
   well-known at the end of compression. Flame initiation by the spark
   plasma, flame propagation, and autoignition were monitored using
   high-speed optical imaging of chemiluminescence and in situ pressure
   time histories. End-of-compression temperatures from T-EOC= 942-1012 K
   were considered, while the end-of-compression pressures were nominally
   constant within the range of P-EOC = 7.8-9.5 atm. The fuel-to-O-2 molar
   equivalence ratio was varied from phi = 0.20-0.99 and dilution, defined
   as the molar ratio of inert gases to O-2 in the reactant mixture, was
   varied from inert: O-2 = 3.76-7.47 to determine the effects on
   flame/autoignition interactions as well as to identify the lean
   flammability limit of the mixtures as a function of dilution. Flame
   propagation is generally expected to decrease autoignition delay times
   by compression heating the unburned portion of the mixture. The effect
   of flame propagation was maximized in these experiments by igniting the
   mixtures early during the autoignition process. Later spark timings had
   small to negligible effect on the autoignition delay time. Dilution had
   significant effect on the lean flammability limits, increasing from a
   lean limit of phi = 0.35 at air levels of dilution to phi = 0.65 at
   inert:O-2 dilution of 7.5. The flammability limit was well correlated
   with the theoretical adiabatic flame temperature of each experiment. The
   propagation rates of flames successfully initiated by the spark plasma
   were determined from the imaging data and were similar to 1 to 12 m/s.
   The magnitude of the propagation rates and the effect on the time
   integrated temperature scaled with the energy content of the mixtures as
   indicated by the theoretical adiabatic flame temperature. (C) 2014 The

Title = {{A multi-scale asymptotic scaling and regime analysis of flamelet
   equations including tangential diffusion effects for laminar and

Abstract = {{Recently, the relevance of tangential diffusion effects has been
   identified for laminar flames. These effects are not considered in the
   classical flamelet equations. In the present work, flamelet equations
   including these effects are derived, and their relevance is investigated
   by a multi-scale asymptotic scaling analysis. The analysis yields
   characteristic ratios dependent on the local curvature of the mixture
   fraction field, the scalar dissipation rate, and the flame thickness,
   which indicate whether tangential diffusion effects become important. By
   comparing relevant scales, a regime diagram is developed and three
   different flamelet regimes are identified. In regime I, the classical
   flamelet equations are valid. In regime II, differential diffusion of
   species and temperature in flame-tangential direction becomes relevant.
   In regime III, additional transport along mixture fraction isosurfaces
   exhibits an influence on the flame structure. In the latter case it is
   not sufficient to condition species mass fractions and temperature on
   the mixture fraction alone since these quantities are not represented by
   a one-dimensional structure.
   The asymptotic scaling is verified against fully resolved numerical data
   of a laminar non-premixed methane-air flame and a turbulent lifted
   hydrogen jet flame. Budgets of different flamelet solutions of the
   laminar flame reveal that tangential diffusion effects are dominant over
   the classical flamelet terms near the flame centerline, while in regions
   away from it, standard flamelet terms are prevailing. For the turbulent
   flame, the results show that tangential diffusion effects are more
   localized and can exceed flame-normal transport, although, unsteadiness
   is more likely the key factor of the configuration.
   While the classical flamelet model is applicable for certain flames,
   this study shows that tangential diffusion effects may require
   consideration for general flame configurations. (C) 2014 The Combustion

Abstract = {{Objective. The focus of this review is to summarize recent advances on
   regenerative tech-nologies (scaffolding matrices, cell/gene therapy and
   biologic drug delivery) to promotere construction of tooth and dental
   implant-associated bone defects.
   Methods. An overview of scaffolds developed for application in bone
   regeneration is pre-sented with an emphasis on identifying the primary
   criteria required for optimized scaffold design for the purpose of
   regenerating physiologically functional osseous tissues. Growth factors
   and other biologics with clinical potential for osteogenesis are
   examined, with a comprehensive assessment of preclinical and clinical
   studies. Potential novel improvements to current matrix-based delivery
   platforms for increased control of growth factor spatiotemporal release
   kinetics are highlighting including recent advancements in stem cell and
   gene therapy.
   Results. An analysis of existing scaffold materials, their strategic
   design for tissue regeneration, and use of growth factors for improved
   bone formation in oral regenerative therapies results in the
   identification of current limitations and required improvements to
   continue moving the field of bone tissue engineering forward into the
   clinical arena.
   Significance. Development of optimized scaffolding matrices for the
   predictable regeneration of structurally and physiologically functional
   osseous tissues is still an elusive goal. The introduction of growth
   factor biologics and cells has the potential to improve the biomimetic
   properties and regenerative potential of scaffold-based delivery
   platforms for next-generation patient-specific treatments with greater
   clinical outcome predictability. (C) 2015 Academy of Dental Materials.

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a terahertz (THz) switch that comprises a
   metallic perfect conductor in the form of periodically corrugated
   cylindrical waveguides surrounding a dielectric medium consisting of
   GaAs compound semiconductor. The proposed switch deploys a composite
   waveguide-cavity-waveguide structure. The switch controls its state by
   dynamically altering the optical properties of an engineered nonlinear
   material inside the cavity, while the corrugated waveguides on both
   sides of the cavity are incorporated to limit the propagation of
   electromagnetic (EM) waves at nearly THz frequencies only. At the
   resonant frequency, the corrugated waveguide allows strong EM
   confinement inside the grooves. The cavity has been designed to achieve
   a high quality factor as well as to trap EM waves for a significant
   period of time. Small changes in the GaAs refractive index inside the
   grooves can alter the cavity resonant frequency. Localized doping near
   the metal conductor inside the cavity is implemented so that by applying
   a voltage between the metal electrode and the depletion region in the
   dielectric medium, the switch can be altered from the ON state to the
   OFF state, and vice versa.}},

Abstract = {{This article reviews systematic research on combustion instabilities
   (principally rare, random misfires and partial burns) in spray-guided
   stratified-charge (SGSC) engines operated at part load with highly
   stratified fuel -air -residual mixtures. Results from high-speed optical
   imaging diagnostics and numerical simulation provide a conceptual
   framework and quantify the sensitivity of ignition and flame propagation
   to strong, cyclically varying temporal and spatial gradients in the flow
   field and in the fuel -air -residual distribution. For SGSC engines
   using multi-hole injectors, spark stretching and locally rich ignition
   are beneficial. Combustion instability is dominated by convective flow
   fluctuations that impede motion of the spark or flame kernel toward the
   bulk of the fuel, coupled with low flame speeds due to locally lean
   mixtures surrounding the kernel. In SGSC engines using outwardly opening
   piezo-electric injectors, ignition and early flame growth are strongly
   influenced by the spray's characteristic recirculation vortex. For both
   injection systems, the spray and the intake/compression-generated flow
   field influence each other. Factors underlying the benefits of
   multi-pulse injection are identified. Unresolved questions include (1)
   the extent to which piezo-SGSC misfires are caused by failure to form a
   flame kernel rather than by flame-kernel extinction (as in multi-hole
   SGSC engines); (2) the relative contributions of partially premixed
   flame propagation and mixing-controlled combustion under the
   exceptionally late-injection conditions that permit SGSC operation on
   E85-like fuels with very low NOx and soot emissions; and (3) the effects
   of flow-field variability on later combustion, where fuel-air-residual
   mixing within the piston bowl becomes important.}},

Abstract = {{Cycle-to-cycle variability of intake-jet flow in an optical engine was
   measured using particle image velocimetry, revealing the possibility of
   two different flow patterns. A phase-dependent proper orthogonal
   decomposition analysis showed that one or the other flow pattern would
   appear in the average flow, sampled from test to test or sub-sampled
   within a single test; each data set contained individual cycles showing
   one flow pattern or the other. Three-dimensional velocity data from a
   large-eddy simulation of the engine showed that the particle image
   velocimetry plane cuts through a region of high shear between the intake
   jet and another large flow structure. Rotating the measurement plane +/-
   10 degrees revealed one or the other flow structure observed in the
   particle image velocimetry measurements. Thus, it was hypothesized that
   cycle-to-cycle variations in the swirl ratio result in the two different
   flow patterns in the particle image velocimetry plane. Having an
   unambiguous metric to reveal large-scale flow cycle-to-cycle
   variability, causes for this variability were examined within the
   possible sources present in the available testing. In particular,
   variations in intake-port and cylinder pressure, lateral valve
   oscillations, and engine RPM were examined as potential causes for the
   cycle-to-cycle flow variations using the phase-dependent proper
   orthogonal decomposition coefficients. No direct correlation was seen
   between the intake-port pressure, or the pressure drop across the intake
   valve, and the in-cylinder flow pattern. A correlation was observed
   between dominant flow pattern and cycle-to-cycle variations in
   intake-valve horizontal position. RPM values and in-cylinder flow
   patterns did not correlate directly. However, a shift in flow pattern
   was observed between early and late cycles in a 2900-cycle test after an
   approximately 5 r/min engine speed perturbation.}},

Abstract = {{With the two key controlling parameters identified and their
   effectiveness demonstrated in Part I of this study series for
   constructing a continuous residual stress profile at weld region, a
   classical shell theory based model is proposed in this paper (Part II)
   for describing through-thickness residual stress distributions of both
   axial and hoop components at any axial location beyond weld region. The
   shell theory based model is analytically constructed through an assembly
   of two parts: One represents weld region and the other represents the
   remaining component section away from weld. The final assembly of the
   two parts leads to a closed form solution to both axial and hoop
   residual stress components as a function of axial distance from weld toe
   position. The effectiveness of the full-field residual stress estimation
   scheme is demonstrated by comparing with a series of finite element
   modeling results over a broad range of pipe weld geometries and welding
   conditions. The present development should provide a consistent and
   effective means for estimating through-thickness residual stress profile
   as a continuous function of pipe geometry, welding heat input, as well
   as material characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the mechanism for the formation of conical micro-spikes on
   an AISI 4340 steel surface under femtosecond irradiation at
   near-threshold fluence and at a high repetition rate. We establish that
   the conical micro-spikes formed in this way are unique and result from a
   completely different formation mechanism compared to previously reported
   formations which are characterized by a random evolution of re-condensed
   oxide particulates. An experimental micro-spike formation map
   demonstrates how random micro-spike formations progress to uniform
   micro-spikes as the fluence increases and how the scan-speed affects the
   size of the spikes. Apart from fluence, we show that a change in focal
   position can help to fine-tune the energy density, resulting in
   identical random conical micro-spikes. The fabricated surfaces show an
   extraordinary absorption coefficient of up to 0.91 resulting from
   multiple reflections in the valleys between the micro-spikes. Finally,
   we find that the relationship between cone number density and scan speed
   for near-threshold fluence is caused by reduced heat accumulation,
   increasing the survival rate of cone formation sites.}},

Abstract = {{Wifi tethering enables Wifi-only devices to access the Internet by
   sharing the WWAN (e.g., 3G and LTE) connection of a smartphone where
   there is no available Wifi access point. However, the current tethering
   schemes have a limitation as they consume a significant portion of the
   battery power for providing Wifi clients with the Internet connection.
   In this paper, we propose a new tethering scheme that reduces the energy
   consumption of a mobile AP (MAP) without substantial throughput and
   delay degradation. To improve energy efficiency, the proposed scheme
   adaptively adjusts the sleep and wake-up periods based on the bandwidth
   asymmetric feature of the MAP. Further, it provides a longer idle time
   enough to put the clients into a sleep mode by combining idle periods
   between subsequent packets, and conserves their energy as well. Our
   evaluation based on the prototype implementation on commercial
   smartphones shows that the proposed scheme reduces the energy
   consumption of the MAP and the client smartphones by up to 56.0 and 8.3
   \%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Progress in understanding turbulent combustion requires access to
   information that is derived from instantaneous 3D images showing the
   contours of the flame front, the flow field, and other quantities. The
   experimental effort to acquire such information is typically
   extraordinarily high and therefore not as widely used as needed. The
   introduction of commercially available plenoptic cameras now provides a
   means to simplify some of these measurements as is described in this
   study. A single 29 mega-pixel plenoptic camera was used to record the
   Mie scattering signals from volumetrically illuminated fuel sprays.
   Instantaneous 3D images were acquired from within the cylinder of an
   optically accessible engine for three automotive fuel injectors of
   differing nominal spray angles. Current reconstruction algorithms do not
   yet take translucent imaging conditions into account and therefore a
   quantitative analysis of the full 3D structure of the sprays was not
   possible. However, the plenoptic system did prove capable of accurately
   reconstructing bulk spray features such as spray angles. The 3D spray
   images were validated with data from a conventional 2D imaging system.
   This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a single plenoptic
   camera to view spray geometry in 3D, even from within the challenging
   in-cylinder engine environment.}},

Abstract = {{Despite considerable research on aerodynamic shape optimization, there
   is no standard benchmark problem allowing researchers to compare
   results. This work addresses this issue by solving a series of
   aerodynamic shape optimization problems based on the Common Research
   Model wing benchmark case defined by the Aerodynamic Design Optimization
   Discussion Group. The aerodynamic model solves the Reynolds-averaged
   Navier-Stokes equations with a Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. A
   gradient-based optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with an
   adjoint method that computes the required derivatives. The drag
   coefficient is minimized subject to lift, pitching moment, and geometric
   constraints. A multilevel technique is used to reduce the computational
   cost of the optimization. A single-point optimization is solved with 720
   shape variables using a 28.8-million-cell mesh, reducing the drag by
   8.5\%. A more realistic design is achieved through a multipoint
   optimization. Multiple local minima are found when starting from
   multiple randomly generated geometries, but the minimum drag values are
   within 0.1 drag counts of each other, and the geometries differ by only
   0.4\% of the mean aerodynamic chord. The effect of varying the number of
   shape design variables is examined. The Common Research Model wing
   benchmark problem proved to be useful for evaluating our design
   optimization framework, and the geometries and meshes for both the
   baseline and optimized wings are available as supplemental materials in
   this paper.}},

Title = {{X-ray absorption spectroscopy study of Cu(II) coordination in the
   interlayer of montmorillonite}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{122-130}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Cu(II) coordination in the interlayer of an expandable clay mineral
   montmorillonite is studied using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
   along with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray diffraction
   (XRD). Ab initio calculations are performed using FEFF code to reproduce
   the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray
   absorption fine structure (EXAFS) portion of the experimentally measured
   XAS spectra. Cu(II) coordination changes depending on the Cu(II) loading
   and hydration state of the interlayer. XRD shows that the Cu-saturated
   montmorillonite has d(001)-spacing values corresponding to the
   interlayer thickness of four and one water layer(s) for the hydrated and
   dehydrated interlayers, respectively. EPR shows that Cu(II) in the fully
   hydrated, unsaturated interlayer behaves similarly to free Cu(II) ion in
   a bulk aqueous solution, while Cu(II) forms a square planar complex in
   the dehydrated interlayer. Cu(II) in the fully hydrated, Cu-saturated
   montmorillonite has a characteristic singlet 1st derivative XANES
   spectrum. FEFF calculations show that this singlet feature originates
   from a quasi-regular octahedral coordination of water molecules around
   the interlayer Cu(II) atom. All other samples and model compounds
   including the dry Cu-saturated montmorillonite, wet and dry unsaturated
   montmorillonite, aqueous Cu(II), cupric nitrate salt (Cu(NO3)(2)center
   dot 4.5H(2)O), and Cu(II) hydroxide precipitates have doublet 1st
   derivative XANES spectra. FEFF calculations suggest that the doublet
   features arise from an axially elongated octahedral coordination under
   the Jahn-Teller effect or square planar coordination. FEFF calculations
   of the EXAFS spectra as a function of the axial oxygen bond length
   demonstrate that a destructive interference between backscattering from
   equatorial oxygen (O-eq) and that from axial oxygen (O-ax) atoms leads
   to an apparent coordination number (CN) less than six expected for the
   tetragonal coordination, with the farther, loosely bound axial oxygen
   atoms making a minor, yet negative contribution to the CN determined by
   the EXAFS analysis. This study shows that Cu(II) has interchangeable
   octahedral, tetragonal, and square planar coordinations in the
   interlayer of montmorillonite, depending on Cu(II) loading and degree of
   hydration. The quasi-regular octahedral coordination of the interlayer
   Cu(II) in montmorillonite is a new finding of this study. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Our previous work revealed that torso cutaneous information contributes
   to the internal representation of the torso and plays a role in postural
   control. Hence, the aims of this study were to assess whether posture
   could be manipulated by patterns of vibrotactile stimulation and to
   determine whether resulting modified postures were associated with
   specific and consistent spatial attitudes. Ten healthy young adults
   stood in normal and Romberg stances with six vibrating actuators
   positioned on the torso in contact with the skin over the anatomical
   locations corresponding to left and right external oblique, internal
   oblique and erector spinae muscles at the L4/L5 vertebrae level. A
   250-Hz tactile vibration was applied for 5 s either at a single location
   or consecutively at each location in clockwise or counterclockwise
   sequences. Kinematic analysis of the body segments indicated that
   postural responses observed in response to single and sequential
   stimulation patterns were similar, while the center of pressure remained
   unaltered in any situations. Moreover, torso inclinations followed
   rectilinear-like path segments chartered by stimuli loci during
   sequential stimulations. Comparison of torso attitudes with previous
   results obtained with co-vibration patterns of the same duration showed
   that torso inclination amplitudes are equivalent for single (one
   location) and co-vibration (pairs of locations) patterns inducing the
   same directional effect. Hence, torso cutaneous information exhibits
   kinesthetic properties, appears to provide a map of upper body spatial
   configuration, and could assume the role of an internal positioning
   system for the upper body.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{With increasing popularity and deployment of multi-core chips in
   embedded systems, a number of real-time multiprocessor scheduling
   algorithms have been proposed along with their schedulability analyses
   (or tests), which verify temporal correctness under a specific
   algorithm. Each of these algorithms often comes with several different
   schedulability tests, especially when it is difficult to find exact
   schedulability tests for the algorithm. Such tests usually find
   different task sets deemed schedulable even under the same scheduling
   algorithm. While these different tests have been compared with each
   other in terms of schedulability performance, little has been done on
   how to combine such different tests to improve the overall
   schedulability of a given scheduling algorithm beyond a simple union of
   their individual schedulability. Motivated by this, we propose a
   composition theory for schedulability tests with two new methods. The
   first method composes task-level timing guarantees derived from
   different schedulability tests, and the second one derives system-level
   schedulability results from a single schedulability test. The unified
   composition theory with these two methods then utilizes existing
   schedulability tests effectively so as to cover additional schedulable
   task sets. The proposed composition theory is shown to be applicable to
   most existing preemptive/non-preemptive scheduling algorithms. We also
   present three case-studies, demonstrating how and by how much the theory
   can improve schedulability by composing existing schedulability tests.
   Our evaluation results also show that the composition theory makes it
   possible to cover up to 181.7 percent additional schedulable task sets
   for preemptive fpEDF, preemptive EDF and non-preemptive EDF scheduling
   algorithms beyond their existing tests.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies adaptive sensing for estimating the nonzero
   amplitudes of a sparse signal with the aim of providing analytical
   guarantees on the performance gain due to adaptive resource allocation.
   We consider a previously proposed optimal two-stage policy for
   allocating sensing resources. For positive powers q, we derive tight
   upper bounds on the mean qth-power error resulting from the optimal
   two-stage policy and corresponding lower bounds on the improvement over
   nonadaptive uniform sensing. It is shown that the adaptation gain is
   related to the detectability of nonzero signal components as
   characterized by Chernoff coefficients, thus quantifying analytically
   the dependence on the sparsity level of the signal, the signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR), and the sensing resource budget. For fixed sparsity levels
   and increasing SNR or sensing budget, we obtain the rate of convergence
   to oracle performance and the rate at which the fraction of resources
   spent on the first exploratory stage decreases to zero. For a vanishing
   fraction of nonzero components, the gain increases without bound as a
   function of SNR and sensing budget. Numerical simulations demonstrate
   that the bounds on adaptation gain are quite tight in nonasymptotic
   regimes as well.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems such as cell-laden hydrogels are
   superior to standard two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures for many
   drug-screening applications. However, their adoption into
   high-throughput screening (HTS) has been lagging, in part because of the
   difficulty of incorporating these culture formats into existing robotic
   liquid handling and imaging infrastructures. Dispensing cell-laden
   prepolymer solutions into 2D well plates is a potential solution but
   typically requires large volumes of reagents to avoid evaporation during
   polymerization, which (1) increases costs, (2) makes drug penetration
   variable and (3) complicates imaging. Here we describe a technique to
   efficiently produce 3D microgels using automated liquid-handling systems
   and standard, nonpatterned, flat-bottomed, 384-well plates.
   Sub-millimeter-diameter, cell-laden collagen gels are deposited on the
   bottom of a 2.5 mm diameter microwell with no concerns about evaporation
   or meniscus effects at the edges of wells, using aqueous two-phase
   system patterning. The microscale cell-laden collagen-gel constructs are
   readily imaged and readily penetrated by drugs. The cytotoxicity of
   chemotherapeutics was monitored by bioluminescence and demonstrated that
   3D cultures confer chemoresistance as compared with similar 2D cultures.
   Hence, these data demonstrate the importance of culturing cells in 3D to
   obtain realistic cellular responses. Overall, this system provides a
   simple and inexpensive method for integrating 3D culture capability into
   existing HTS infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a shear localization model for simulating the
   shear band formation process uniquely associated with friction stir
   welding. By introducing a thermal and plastic deformation boundary layer
   definition, the shear band formation process can be modeled as shear
   localization phenomena using one-dimensional coupled elastic
   visco-plastic model. Material constitutive behavior is assumed to follow
   Zener-Hollomon constitutive equation. With this model, shear band width,
   formation time and propagation speed can be theoretically estimated as a
   measure of friction stir weldability. As such, the shear band
   propagation speed serves as a theoretical estimate of the maximum
   possible welding speed under given base material and welding conditions,
   such as stir pin rotational speed and torque level. The model is shown
   to provide reasonable estimates of shear localization parameters when
   compared with recent experimental data on titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V. With
   this model, some fundamental questions such as why titanium alloys are
   more difficult to weld than aluminum alloys or steels can be more
   quantitatively addressed. And consequently, potential means for
   mitigating some of the difficulties in friction stir welding of some of
   the alloys can be theoretically examined to provide guidance for
   cost-effective development of welding process parameters for new
   applications.}},

   of structures subjected to fire. In particular, the FORM and SORM
   algorithms are implemented in a sequentially coupled thermal-structural
   finite-element model. A protected steel column exposed to natural fire
   is presented as an example. In comparison to Latin hypercube sampling
   (LHS), the analytical reliability method yields sufficient accuracy and
   provides a significant saving in computational expense. Discrepancies
   between the analytical methods and LHS are analyzed in depth, and it is
   shown that the parametric fire model produces a response surface that is
   highly nonlinear. Despite differences between the FORM and LHS
   solutions, the utilization of FORM is recommended for the rapid
   estimation of the reliability of structures threatened by fire. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of a
   magnetically coupled piezoelectric energy harvester under low frequency
   excitation where the angle of the external magnetic field is adjustable.
   The nonlinear dynamic equation with the identified nonlinear magnetic
   force is derived to describe the electromechanical interaction of
   variable inclination angle harvesters. The effect of excitation
   amplitude and frequency on dynamic behavior is proposed by using the
   phase trajectory, power spectrum, and bifurcation diagram. The numerical
   analysis shows that a rotating magnetically coupled energy harvesting
   system exhibits rich nonlinear characteristics with the change of
   external magnet inclination angle. The nonlinear route to and from large
   amplitude high-energy motion can be clearly observed. It is demonstrated
   numerically and experimentally that lumped parameters equations with an
   identified polynomials for magnetic force could adequately describe the
   characteristics of nonlinear energy harvester. The rotating magnetically
   coupled energy harvester possesses the usable frequency bandwidth over a
   wide range of low frequency excitation by adjusting the angular
   orientation.}},

Title = {{Dynamic stability of a bar under high loading rate: Response to local
   perturbations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{301-308}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Of interest here is the influence of loading rate on the stability of
   structures where inertia is taken into account. The approach currently
   used in the literature to analyze these stability problems, is the
   method of modal analysis that determines the structure's fastest growing
   wavelength, which is meaningful only for cases where the velocity of the
   perfect structure is significantly lower than the associated
   characteristic wave propagation speeds. The novel idea here is to
   analyze the time-dependent response to perturbations of the transient
   (high strain rates) states of these structures, in order to understand
   the initiation of the corresponding failure mechanisms.
   We are motivated by the recent experimental studies of Zhang and
   Ravi-Chandar (2006) on the high strain rate extension of thin rings that
   show no evidence of a dominant wavelength in their failure mode and no
   influence of strain-rate sensitivity on the necking strains. In the
   interest of analytical tractability, we study the extension of an
   incompressible, nonlinearly elastic bar at different strain rates. The
   dynamic stability of these bars is studied by following the evolution of
   localized small perturbations introduced at different times. It is shown
   that these structures are stable until the static necking strain is
   reached at some point. Moreover their failure pattern is dictated by the
   distribution of defects, the minimum distance between necks diminishes
   with increasing strain rate and there is no dominant wavelength mode,
   exactly as observed experimentally in Zhang and Ravi-Chandar (2006). (C)

Abstract = {{This research presents an experimental study evaluating stomach suturing
   using a pre-curved nickel-titanium (NiTi) guidewire for an endoscopic

   for accurate and effective suturing. A position measurement system
   utilizing a hand-held magnetic sensor was used to measure the shape of a
   precurved guidewire and to determine the radius of curvature before and
   after suturing. Ex vivo stomach suturing experiments using four
   different guidewire tip designs varying the radius of curvature and
   bevel angles were conducted. The changes in radius of curvature and
   suturing force during suturing were measured. A model was developed to
   predict the guidewire radius of curvature based on the measured suturing
   force. Results show that a small bevel angle and a large radius of
   curvature reduce the suturing force and the combination of small bevel
   angle and small radius of curvature can maintain the shape of guidewire
   for accurate suturing.}},

Abstract = {{Machine health prognosis plays an important role in the dynamic
   maintenance decision-making. For complex manufacturing systems, it is
   necessary to schedule a predictive maintenance program and avoid
   production losses by predicting machine degradations. This paper
   proposes a novel prognostic method, a real-time rolling grey forecasting
   method, to provide efficient and accurate machine health prediction,
   while effects of influencing factors such as operating load are
   considered and analyzed. In this grey forecasting model, generating
   coefficient values corresponding to variable operating loads are
   dynamically generated to overcome the shortage of a static value. It
   improves the forecast accuracy of the frequency of failures. A series
   data about increasing machine health states of failure frequency is used
   as the in-sample test data. Results of the out-of-sample predictive data
   show that the application of the proposed method leads to a noticeable
   increase in forecast accuracy. This indicates the improved rolling grey
   forecasting model offers a potential to predict the failure frequency
   trend for supporting the dynamic maintenance schedule.}},

Abstract = {{The work presents a performance model of the method of characteristic

   Equation and has been implemented in the Michigan PArallel
   Characteristic based Transport (MPACT) code for 2-D and 3-D transport
   calculations. The process of boundary averaging reduced the storage and
   computation but the capability of dealing with complicated geometries is
   preserved since the same ray tracing information is used as in MOC. The
   benefits of CDP are demonstrated by the developed performance model
   which describes the storage, floating point operations and calculation
   time. The numerical results are given for different cases to show the
   accuracy, storage, floating point operations and computing time of the
   CDP compared to the MOC using the performance model. From the cases
   examined, the boundary average method shows significant improvement on
   the storage and computational efficiency for three-dimensional cases

   cholesta-4,6-diene likely formed from cholesta-3,5-diene by double-bond

   fumigated into the intake air and displaced some of the directly
   injected ultralow sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD) needed to maintain the
   engine and a constant speed and load. Fumigation of DME and propane
   significantly increased BTE and reduced brake specific energy
   consumption (BSEC) compared to the baseline diesel condition with no
   fumigation. A mixture of 20\% DME with 30\% propane provided the maximum
   BTE, with 24\% reduction in BSEC, however, at the expense of increasing
   peak cylinder pressure by 6 bar, which was even higher at greater DME
   substitutions. Fumigated DME auto-ignited early, ahead of top dead
   center (TDC), showing the typical low temperature heat release (LTHR)
   and high temperature heat release (HTHR) events and propane addition
   suppressed the early LTHR, shifting more of the DME heat release closer
   to TDC. Total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions increased, while NOx emissions
   reduced with increasing fumigation.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of buildings participating in demand response (DR)
   programs is usually evaluated with baseline models, which predict what
   electric demand would have been if a DR event had not been called.
   Different baseline models produce different results. Moreover, modelers
   implementing the same baseline model often make different model
   implementation choices producing different results. Using real data from
   a DR program in CA and a regression-based baseline model, which relates
   building demand to time of week, outdoor air temperature, and building
   operational mode, we analyze the effect of model implementation choices
   on DR shed estimates. Results indicate strong sensitivities to the
   outdoor air temperature data source and bad data filtration methods,
   with standard deviations of differences in shed estimates of approximate
   to 20-30 kW, and weaker sensitivities to demand/temperature data
   resolution, data alignment, and methods for determining when buildings
   are occupied, with standard deviations of differences in shed estimates
   of approximate to 2-5 kW.}},

Abstract = {{The nanoscale structural, chemical, and electronic properties of

   superconducting Co-doped BaFe2As2 (Ba-122) and nonsuperconducting SrTiO3
   (STO) layers are determined by using atomically resolved scanning
   transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy.
   The bonding of Ba-122/STO occurring between As (Ba) and SrO (TiO2)
   terminated layers has been identified. The thin STO (3 unit cell)
   insertion layers are a mixture of cations (Ba, Sr, Fe, and Ti) and rich
   in oxygen vacancies and the Ba-122 layers (10 unit cell) are free of
   vertical second phases. Our results explain why these superlattices show
   anisotropic transport response to an external magnetic field, i.e.,
   strong ab-axis pinning (enhancing critical current density) and no
   c-axis pinning, which is opposite to single layer Ba-122 thin films.
   These findings reveal physical and chemical properties of
   superconducting/nonsuperconducting heterostructures and provide
   important insights into engineering of superconducting devices.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{340}},

Abstract = {{Passive structural damping treatments have been applied with the use of
   high-viscosity fillings (in practice) and have been the focus of
   numerous research studies and papers. However, internal viscoelastic
   fluid leading to passive damping of flexible cantilever beams, has not
   yet been investigated in the literature. Although structures containing
   internal fluid channels provide multifunctional solutions to many
   engineering issues, they also raise damping control requests caused by
   unacceptable vibrations due to ambient environmental changes. In this
   paper, we examine ambient effects on damping properties of flexible
   cantilever beams, each conveying an internal high-viscosity fluid
   channel. Experiments are conducted to investigate how the internal
   fluids provide damping to the system under varied temperatures,
   frequencies and base-acceleration levels. While the vibration analysis
   of pipes conveying internal flow has been extensively studied, internal
   high-viscosity fluids in relation to passive damping of flexible
   cantilever beams and their ambient, environment-dependent behaviors have
   not been well-investigated. Originally motivated by research, which uses
   internal fluid channels to provide the cooling of multifunctional
   composite structures, we aim to research the damping behaviors of
   cantilever beams. We will conduct an experimental study and modeling
   analysis, examining the vibrations and frequency responses of the
   cantilever beams when filled with three types of internal fluids. (C)

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{13}},

Abstract = {{High order harmonic generation (HHG) from laser solid-density plasma
   interactions is considered as a promising way to generate bright and
   ultrashort burst of x-rays. One of the key issues for HHG is the low
   conversion efficiency due to a power law fall off in harmonic intensity.
   Here, we explore a possible mechanism for HHG enhancement by reflecting
   an intense laser pulse multiple times between two plasma surfaces. We
   find that HHG can be nonlinearly enhanced by orders of magnitude through
   multiple reflections compared with a single reflection. We argue this
   enhancement is due to the non-linear combination of the relativistically
   oscillating plasma mirror and the harmonic-rich pulse generated in
   preceding reflections. This mechanism should allow moderate power laser
   systems to efficiently generate coherent, ultrashort bursts of soft
   x-rays. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic Models to Describe the Dynamics of Migrating Microbial
   Communities}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{In all but the most sterile environments bacteria will reside in fluid
   being transported through conduits and some of these will attach and
   grow as biofilms on the conduit walls. The concentration and diversity
   of bacteria in the fluid at the point of delivery will be a mix of those
   when it entered the conduit and those that have become entrained into
   the flow due to seeding from biofilms. Examples include fluids through
   conduits such as drinking water pipe networks, endotracheal tubes,
   catheters and ventilation systems. Here we present two probabilistic
   models to describe changes in the composition of bulk fluid microbial
   communities as they are transported through a conduit whilst exposed to
   biofilm communities. The first (discrete) model simulates absolute
   numbers of individual cells, whereas the other (continuous) model
   simulates the relative abundance of taxa in the bulk fluid. The discrete
   model is founded on a birth-death process whereby the community changes
   one individual at a time and the numbers of cells in the system can
   vary. The continuous model is a stochastic differential equation derived
   from the discrete model and can also accommodate changes in the carrying
   capacity of the bulk fluid. These models provide a novel Lagrangian
   framework to investigate and predict the dynamics of migrating microbial
   communities. In this paper we compare the two models, discuss their
   merits, possible applications and present simulation results in the
   context of drinking water distribution systems. Our results provide
   novel insight into the effects of stochastic dynamics on the composition
   of non-stationary microbial communities that are exposed to biofilms and
   provides a new avenue for modelling microbial dynamics in systems where
   fluids are being transported.}},

Abstract = {{Dissociation-induced apoptosis of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)
   hampers their large-scale culture. Herein we leveraged the
   mechanosensitivity of hESCs and employed, to our knowledge, a novel
   technique, acoustic tweezing cytometry (ATC), for subcellular mechanical
   stimulation of disassociated single hESCs to improve their survival. By
   acoustically actuating integrin-bound microbubbles (MBs) to live cells,
   ATC increased the survival rate and cloning efficiency of hESCs by
   threefold. A positive correlation was observed between the increased
   hESC survival rate and total accumulative displacement of
   integrin-anchored MBs during ATC stimulation. ATC may serve as a
   promising biocompatible tool to improve hESC culture.}},

Abstract = {{Design and synthesis of porous solids employing both reversible
   coordination chemistry and reversible covalent bond formation is
   described. The combination of two different linkage modes in a single
   material presents a link between two distinct classes of porous
   materials as exemplified by metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent
   organic frameworks (COFs). This strategy, in addition to being a
   compelling material-discovery method, also offers a platform for
   developing a fundamental understanding of the factors influencing the
   competing modes of assembly. We also demonstrate that even temporary
   formation of reversible connections between components may be leveraged
   to make new phases thus offering design routes to polymorphic
   frameworks. Moreover, this approach has the striking potential of
   providing a rich landscape of structurally complex materials from
   commercially available or readily accessible feedstocks.}},

Title = {{Effects of tissue stiffness, ultrasound frequency, and pressure on
   histotripsy-induced cavitation bubble behavior}},

Pages = {{2271-2292}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy is an ultrasound ablation method that controls cavitation to
   fractionate soft tissue. In order to effectively fractionate tissue,
   histotripsy requires cavitation bubbles to rapidly expand from
   nanometer-sized initial nuclei into bubbles often larger than 50 mu m.
   Using a negative pressure high enough to initiate a bubble cloud and
   expand bubbles to a sufficient size, histotripsy has been shown capable
   of completely fractionating soft tissue into acelluar debris resulting
   in effective tissue removal. Previous work has shown that the
   histotripsy process is affected by tissue mechanical properties with
   stiffer tissues showing increased resistance to histotripsy
   fractionation, which we hypothesize to be caused by impeded bubble
   expansion in stiffer tissues. In this study, the hypothesis that
   increases in tissue stiffness cause a reduction in bubble expansion was
   investigated both theoretically and experimentally. High speed optical
   imaging was used to capture a series of time delayed images of bubbles
   produced inside mechanically tunable agarose tissue phantoms using
   histotripsy pulses produced by 345 kHz, 500 kHz, 1.5 MHz, and 3 MHz
   histotripsy transducers. The results demonstrated a significant decrease
   in maximum bubble radius (R-max) and collapse time (t(c)) with both
   increasing Young's modulus and increasing frequency. Furthermore,
   results showed that Rmax was not increased by raising the pressure above
   the intrinsic threshold. Finally, this work demonstrated the potential
   of using a dual-frequency strategy to modulate the expansion of
   histotripsy bubbles. Overall, the results of this study improve our
   understanding of how tissue stiffness and ultrasound parameters affect
   histotripsy-induced bubble behavior and provide a rational basis to
   tailor acoustic parameters for treatment of the specific tissues of
   interest.}},

Abstract = {{The cosmic-ray-induced neutron background at ground level has been
   measured and simulated in conjunction with EJ-309 organic liquid
   scintillators with an approximate deposited energy range of 0.5-6 MeV.
   Specifically, the pulse height distributions, net neutron count rates,
   and angular dependences were obtained. The simulations were carried out
   using the Monte Carlo transport code MCNPX-PoliMi combined with the
   (Cosmic-Ray Shower Generator) CRY source subroutine that returns
   secondary particles produced by cosmic rays. A scaling formula from
   literature was also implemented in the simulation. The angular
   dependence of the neutron count rate was measured by collimating the
   liquid scintillator with polyethylene to attain 18 angular resolution
   from 0 degrees downwards to 72 degrees horizontally. The neutron count
   rate was measured to be 23.10 +/- 1.69 h(-1) sr(-1) at 0 degrees, and
   720 +/- 0.78 h(-1) sr(-1) at 72 degrees. The simulations and
   measurements compare well and show similar cosine anisotropy for the
   angular distribution. The study thus shows that he neutron background
   response in detector systems can be efficiently and accurately simulated
   using the procedures described. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   particle via the Coulomb interaction between the density induced in the

   Energy relaxation rates are computed using time-dependent perturbation
   theory. The method, which is applicable wherever DFPT is, is illustrated
   with results for CsI, an important scintillator whose performance is
   affected by electron thermalization. We discuss the influence of the

Abstract = {{The real-time temperature measurement of nanostructured materials is
   particularly attractive in view of increasing needs of local temperature
   probing with high sensitivity and resolution in nanoelectronics,
   integrated photonics, and biomedicine. Light-induced heating and Raman
   scattering of single-walled carbon nanotubes with adsorbed gold
   nanoparticles decorating silica microparticles are reported, by both
   green and near IR lasers. The plasmonic shell is used as nanoheater,
   while the single-walled carbon nanotubes are Raman active and serve as a
   thermometer. Stokes and Anti-Stokes Raman spectra of single-walled
   carbon nanotubes serve to estimate the effective light-induced
   temperature rise on the metal nanoparticles. The temperature rise is
   constant with time, indicating stability of the adsorption density. The
   effective temperatures derived from Stokes and Anti-Stokes intensities
   are correlated with those measured in a heating stage. The resolution of
   the thermal experiments in our study was found to be 5-40 K.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite observations of carbon dioxide (CO2) offer novel and
   distinctive opportunities for improving our quantitative understanding
   of the carbon cycle. Prospective observations include those from
   space-based lidar such as the active sensing of CO2 emissions over
   nights, days, and seasons (ASCENDS) mission. Here we explore the ability
   of such a mission to detect regional changes in CO2 fluxes. We
   investigate these using three prototypical case studies, namely, the
   thawing of permafrost in the northern high latitudes, the shifting of
   fossil fuel emissions from Europe to China, and changes in the
   source/sink characteristics of the Southern Ocean. These three scenarios
   were used to design signal detection studies to investigate the ability
   to detect the unfolding of these scenarios compared to a baseline
   scenario. Results indicate that the ASCENDS mission could detect the
   types of signals investigated in this study, with the caveat that the
   study is based on some simplifying assumptions. The permafrost thawing
   flux perturbation is readily detectable at a high level of significance.
   The fossil fuel emission detectability is directly related to the
   strength of the signal and the level of measurement noise. For a nominal
   (lower) fossil fuel emission signal, only the idealized noise-free
   instrument test case produces a clearly detectable signal, while
   experiments with more realistic noise levels capture the signal only in
   the higher (exaggerated) signal case. For the Southern Ocean scenario,
   differences due to the natural variability in the El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation climatic mode are primarily detectable as a zonal increase.}},

Title = {{Comparative life cycle assessment of laminated and vacuum

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{158-169}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Lamination technologies used to produce lithium ion batteries are
   limited by the capital investment needed for multiple unit operations,
   solvent use for electrolyte and electrode slurries, and an inability to
   exert control over active material particle morphology and homogeneity.
   Advancements in thin-film solid-state processing using vacuum coating
   hold promise to overcome these challenges for batteries with superior
   energy density and cycle life, if cost and scalability issues can be
   overcome. A comparative life cycle assessment is reported for battery
   production using lamination and thin-film vacuum vapor deposition.
   Lithium vanadium oxide solid-state cells are found to have the lowest
   impact, per unit energy storage, in cumulative energy demand (CED),
   global warming potential (GWP), and six other midpoint environmental
   indicators. Human health and resource depletion impacts are generally
   higher for lithium manganese oxide and lithium cobalt oxide solid-state
   cells than for their laminated counterparts, whereas CED and GWP per
   unit energy storage are 25-65\% lower for solid-state cells across all
   cathode chemistries. Sensitivity analysis, taking into account
   uncertainties related to solid-state cell properties and vacuum vapor
   deposition process efficiencies, indicates that CED and GWP impacts for
   battery electric vehicle mobility using packs with solid-state cells
   will be lower than those incurred using laminated cells. (C) 2014

Title = {{Experimental evaluation and computational modeling of tissue damage from
   low-flow push-pull perfusion sampling in vivo}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{242}},
Pages = {{97-105}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neurochemical monitoring via sampling probes is valuable for
   deciphering neurotransmission in vivo. Microdialysis is commonly used;
   however, the spatial resolution is poor.
   New Method: Recently push-pull perfusion at low flow rates (50 nL/min)
   has been proposed as a method for in vivo sampling from the central
   nervous system. Tissue damage from such probes has not been investigated
   in detail. In this work, we evaluated acute tissue response to low-flow
   push-pull perfusion by infusing the nuclear stains Sytox Orange and
   Hoechst 33342 through probes implanted in the striatum for 200 min, to
   label damaged and total cells, respectively, in situ.
   Results: Using the damaged/total labeled cell ratio as a measure of
   tissue damage, we found that 33 +/- 8\% were damaged within the dye
   region around a microdialysis probe. We found that low-flow push-pull
   perfusion probes damaged 24 +/- 4\% of cells in the sampling area. Flow
   had no effect on the number of damaged cells for low-flow push-pull
   perfusion. Modeling revealed that shear stress and pressure gradients
   generated by the flow were lower than thresholds expected to cause
   damage.
   Comparison with existing methods. Push-pull perfusion caused less tissue
   damage but yielded 1500-fold better spatial resolution.
   Conclusions: Push-pull perfusion at low flow rates is a viable method
   for sampling from the brain with potential for high temporal and spatial
   resolution. Tissue damage is mostly caused by probe insertion. Smaller
   probes may yield even lower damage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Thermal radiative emission from a hot surface to a cold surface plays an
   important role in many applications, including energy conversion,
   thermal management, lithography, data storage and thermal
   microscopy(1,2). Recent studies(3-5) on bulk materials have confirmed
   long-standing theoretical predictions indicating that when the gap
   between the surfaces is reduced to tens of nanometres, well below the
   peak wavelength of the blackbody emission spectrum, the radiative heat
   flux increases by orders of magnitude. However, despite recent
   attempts(6), whether such enhancements can be obtained in nanoscale
   dielectric films thinner than the penetration depth of thermal
   radiation, as suggested by theory, remains experimentally unknown. Here,
   using an experimental platform that comprises a heat-flow calorimeter
   with a resolution of about 100 pW (ref. 7), we experimentally
   demonstrate a dramatic increase in near-field radiative heat transfer,
   comparable to that obtained between bulk materials, even for very thin
   dielectric films (50-100 nm) when the spatial separation between the hot
   and cold surfaces is comparable to the film thickness. We explain these
   results by analysing the spectral characteristics and mode shapes of
   surface phonon polaritons, which dominate near-field radiative heat
   transport in polar dielectric thin films.}},

Abstract = {{Porousbiodegradable polymer scaffolds are widely utilized for bone
   tissue engineering, but are not osteoconductive like calcium phosphate
   scaffolds. We combine indirect solid freeform fabrication (SFF), ex vivo
   gene therapy, with biomineral coating to compare the effect of
   biomineral coating on bone regeneration for Poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA)
   and Poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds with the same porous
   architecture. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and micro-computed
   tomography (-CT) demonstrate PLLA and PCL scaffolds have the same porous
   architecture and are completely coated. All scaffolds are seeded with
   human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) transduced with adenovirus encoded with
   either bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7) or green fluorescent protein
   (GFP), and implanted into mice subcutaneously for 3 and 10 weeks. Only
   scaffolds with BMP-7 transduced HGFs show mineralized tissue formation.
   At 3 weeks some blood vessel-like structures are observed in coated PLLA
   and PCL scaffolds, but there is no significant difference in bone
   ingrowth between the coated and uncoated scaffolds for either PLLA or
   PCL. At 10 weeks, however, coated scaffolds (both PLLA and PCL) have
   significantly more bone ingrowth than uncoated scaffolds, which have
   more fibrous tissue. Coated PLLA scaffolds have improved mechanical
   properties compared with uncoated PLLA scaffolds due to increased bone
   ingrowth.}},

Title = {{On the impact of indium distribution on the electronic properties in
   InGaN nanodisks}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{We analyze an epitaxially grown heterostructure composed of InGaN
   nanodisks inserted in GaN nanowires in order to relate indium
   concentration to the electronic properties. This study was achieved with
   spatially resolved low-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy using
   monochromated electrons to probe optical excitations-plasmons-at
   nanometer scale. Our findings show that each nanowire has its own indium
   fluctuation and therefore its own average composition. Due to this
   indium distribution, a scatter is obtained in plasmon energies, and
   therefore in the optical dielectric function, of the nanowire ensemble.
   We suppose that these inhomogeneous electronic properties significantly
   alter band-to-band transitions and consequently induce emission
   broadening. In addition, the observation of tailing indium composition
   into the GaN barrier suggests a graded well-barrier interface leading to
   further inhomogeneous broadening of the electro-optical properties. An
   improvement in the indium incorporation during growth is therefore
   needed to narrow the emission linewidth of the presently studied
   heterostructures. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{104}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{Insects are a prime source of inspiration towards the development of
   small-scale, engineered, flapping wing flight systems. To help interpret
   the possible energy transformation strategies observed in Diptera as
   inspiration for mechanical flapping flight systems, we revisit the
   perspective of the dipteran wing motor as a bistable click mechanism and
   take a new, and more flexible, outlook to the architectural composition
   previously considered. Using a representative structural model alongside
   biological insights and cues from nonlinear dynamics, our analyses and
   experimental results reveal that a flight mechanism able to adjust motor
   axial support stiffness and compression characteristics may dramatically
   modulate the amplitude range and type of wing stroke dynamics
   achievable. This corresponds to significantly more versatile aerodynamic
   force generation without otherwise changing flapping frequency or
   driving force amplitude. Whether monostable or bistable, the axial
   stiffness is key to enhance compressed motor load bearing ability and
   aerodynamic efficiency, particularly compared with uncompressed linear
   motors. These findings provide new foundation to guide future
   development of bioinspired, flapping wing mechanisms for micro air
   vehicle applications, and may be used to provide insight to the dipteran
   muscle-to-wing interface.}},

Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{Propagation-invariant beams that pull objects towards a light source are
   commonly known as tractor beams. Here, an efficient, linearly polarized
   tractor beam with improved stability is introduced. The beam consists of
   a superposition of transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic polarized
   Bessel beams of orders m = +1 and m = -1. It is shown that this beam can
   stably pull a wide range of dielectric microparticles arbitrarily long
   distances, independent of ambient conditions. Next, a straightforward
   method of generating these high-performance beams is proposed. A Si
   metasurface transforms an incident linearly polarized Gaussian beam into
   the desired tractor beam. Full-wave simulations demonstrate that it is
   possible for this simple geometry to pull a polystyrene sphere a
   distance equal to the nondiffracting range of the Bessel beam. The
   simplicity of the setup and the robust performance of the proposed
   tractor beam significantly enhance the ability to manipulate matter with

Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{We prove the existence of an asymptotic phase-transition threshold on
   community detectability for the spectral modularity method {[}M. E. J.
   Newman, Phys. Rev. E 74, 036104 (2006) and Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA)
   103, 8577 (2006)] under a stochastic block model. The phase transition
   on community detectability occurs as the intercommunity edge connection
   probability p grows. This phase transition separates a subcritical
   regime of small p, where modularity-based community detection
   successfully identifies the communities, from a supercritical regime of
   large p where successful community detection is impossible. We show
   that, as the community sizes become large, the asymptotic
   phase-transition threshold p{*} is equal to root p(1)p(2), where p(i) (i
   = 1,2) is the within-community edge connection probability. Thus the
   phase-transition threshold is universal in the sense that it does not
   depend on the ratio of community sizes. The universal phase-transition
   phenomenon is validated by simulations for moderately sized communities.
   Using the derived expression for the phase-transition threshold, we
   propose an empirical method for estimating this threshold from
   real-world data.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{Many networks can be usefully decomposed into a dense core plus an
   outlying, loosely connected periphery. Here we propose an algorithm for
   performing such a decomposition on empirical network data using methods
   of statistical inference. Our method fits a generative model of
   core-periphery structure to observed data using a combination of an
   expectation-maximization algorithm for calculating the parameters of the
   model and a belief propagation algorithm for calculating the
   decomposition itself. We find the method to be efficient, scaling easily
   to networks with a million or more nodes, and we test it on a range of
   networks, including real-world examples as well as computer-generated
   benchmarks, for which it successfully identifies known core-periphery
   structure with low error rate. We also demonstrate that the method is
   immune to the detectability transition observed in the related community
   detection problem, which prevents the detection of community structure
   when that structure is too weak. There is no such transition for
   core-periphery structure, which is detectable, albeit with some
   statistical error, no matter how weak it is.}},

Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{4675-4683}},

Abstract = {{The properties of the solid-phase redox end members, alpha-S, beta-S,
   Li2S, and Li2S2, are expected to strongly influence the performance of
   lithium-sulfur batteries. Nevertheless, the fundamental thermodynamic
   and electronic properties of these phases remain poorly understood. From
   a computational standpoint, the absence of these data can be explained
   by the omission of long-ranged van der Waals interactions in
   conventional density functionals; these interactions are essential for
   describing the molecular-crystal nature of S-based compounds. Here we
   apply van der Waals augmented density functional theory (vdW-DF),
   quasi-particle methods (G0W0), and continuum solvation techniques to
   predict several structural, thermodynamic, spectroscopic, electronic,
   and surface characteristics of these phases. The stability of the a
   allotrope of sulfur at low temperatures is confirmed by calculating the
   sulfur phase diagram. Similarly, the stability of lithium persulfide,
   Li2S2, a compound whose presence may limit capacity, was assessed by
   comparing the energies of several hypothetical A(2)B(2) crystal
   structures. In all cases Li2S2 is predicted to be unstable with respect
   to a two-phase mixture of Li2S and alpha-S, suggesting that Li2S2 is a
   metastable phase. Regarding surface properties, the stable surfaces and
   equilibrium crystallite shapes of Li2S and alpha-S were predicted in the
   presence and absence of a continuum solvation field intended to mimic
   the effect of a dimethoxyethane (DME)-based electrolyte. In the case of
   Li2S, the equilibrium crystallites are comprised entirely of
   stoichiometric (111) surfaces, while for alpha-S a complex mixture of
   several facets is predicted. Finally, G0W0 calculations reveal that all
   of alpha-S, beta-S, Li2S, and Li2S2 are insulators with band gaps
   greater than 2.5 eV.}},

   their directional flux is modulated by both actin architecture and the
   structural properties of the myosin lever arm. This directional flux can
   be finely-tuned by the relative number of myosin V and VI motors on each
   scaffold. Pairing computation with experimental observations suggests
   that the ratio of motor stall forces is a key determinant of the
   observed competitive outcomes. Overall, our study demonstrates an
   elegant mechanism for sorting of membrane cargo using equally matched
   antagonistic motors, simply by modulating the relative number of
   engagement sites for each motor type.}},

Title = {{Sex Distribution of Study Samples Reported in American Society of
   Biomechanics Annual Meeting Abstracts}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Study samples should be appropriately selected to maximize
   generalizability of results. Excluding one sex from studies of
   conditions that affect both sexes is problematic and has received
   attention as a public policy issue in the United States, resulting in
   legislation and recommendations made by the National Institutes of
   Health to address this deficiency of study designs. It is unknown to
   what extent biomechanical studies have inappropriately excluded one sex.
   The objective of this study was to provide objective data on this
   question.
   Methods
   A retrospective review of random samples of abstracts presented at
   American Society of Biomechanics annual meetings from 1983 to 2013 was
   conducted to assess reporting of sex of study samples and whether the
   study samples were approximately balanced with respect to sex.
   Findings
   We did not find a statistically significant increasing trend in the
   percentage of abstracts reporting sex over time. However, increasing
   trends were noted in the percentage of abstracts including both sexes
   (p<0.05) and percentage of abstracts having an ``approximately
   balanced{''} study sample containing 50 +/- 20\% females (p>0.05). In
   2013 the percentage of abstracts reporting studies having approximately
   balanced study samples was only 28\%, far from the ideal level of 100\%.
   Interpretation
   While there has been modest change since 1983, there remains significant
   room for improvement in the reporting and composition of experimental
   studies reported at American Society of Biomechanics annual meetings.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of wastewater treatment systems in removing
   pharmaceuticals is often assessed on the basis of the decrease in the
   concentration of the parent compound. However, what is perceived as
   ``removal{''} during treatment may not necessarily mean mineralization
   of the pharmaceutical compound but simply conversion into different
   transformation products (TPs). Using liquid chromatography coupled to a
   quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-QToF-MS), we
   demonstrated conversion of iopromide in wastewater to at least 14 TPs
   after an advanced oxidation process (AOP) using UV (fluence = 1500
   mJ/cm(2)) and H2O2 (10 mg/L). Due to the complexity of the wastewater
   matrix, the initial experiments were performed using a high
   concentration (10 mg/L) of iopromide in order to facilitate the
   identification of TPs. Despite the high concentration of iopromide used,
   cursory inspection of UV and mass spectra only revealed four TPs in the
   chromatograms of the post-AOP samples. However, the use of METLIN
   database and statistics-based profiling tools commonly used in
   metabolomics proved effective in discriminating between background
   signals and TPs derived from iopromide. High-resolution mass data
   allowed one to predict molecular formulas of putative TPs with errors
   below 5 ppm relative to the observed m/z. Tandem mass spectrometry
   (MS/MS) data and isotope pattern comparisons provided necessary
   information that allowed one to elucidate the structure of iopromide
   TPs. The presence of the proposed iopromide TPs was determined in
   unspiked wastewater from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, but no
   iopromide and TPs were detected. Using analogous structural
   modifications and oxidation that results from the AOP treatment of
   iopromide, the potential TPs of iopamidol (a structurally similar
   compound to iopromide) were predicted. The same mass fragmentation
   pattern observed in iopromide TPs was applied to the predicted iopamidol
   TPs. LC-QToF-MS revealed the presence of two iopamidol TPs in unspiked
   AOP-treated wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{We study the interplay between the contributions of electron thermal
   flux and interface scattering to the Kapitza conductance across
   metal-metal interfaces through measurements of thermal conductivity of
   copper-niobium multilayers. Thermal conductivities of copper-niobium
   multilayer films of period thicknesses ranging from 5.4 to 96.2 nm and
   sample thicknesses ranging from 962 to 2677 nm are measured by
   time-domain thermoreflectance over a range of temperatures from 78 to
   500 K. The Kapitza conductances between the Cu and Nb interfaces in
   multilayer films are determined from the thermal conductivities using a
   series resistor model and are in good agreement with the electron
   diffuse mismatch model. Our results for the thermal boundary conductance
   between Cu and Nb are compared to literature values for the thermal
   boundary conductance across Al-Cu and Pd-Ir interfaces, and demonstrate
   that the interface conductance in metallic systems is dictated by the
   temperature derivative of the electron energy flux in the metallic
   layers, rather than electron mean free path or scattering processes at
   the interface. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical model for hydrogen alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel
   cell (AAEMFC) is developed in this study. The results show that due to
   both the electrochemical reaction and electro-osmotic drag, water in
   cathode is consumed faster than oxygen. Proper liquid humidification in
   cathode is favorable for performance improvement, especially at low
   operating temperatures; on the other hand, without liquid
   humidification, high reactant flow rate is needed. If there is no liquid
   humidification and the oxygen stoichiometry ratio is fixed, a higher
   operating pressure increases both the activation loss and ohmic loss,
   leading to lower cell performance. With the increment of catalyst layer
   (CL) thickness, the reactant concentration in CL decreases, and the
   ohmic resistance of electron and ion increases. Decreasing the membrane
   thickness reduces both the ohmic resistance and activation loss, because
   more water can transfer from anode to cathode. Copyright (C) 2015,

Abstract = {{It has previously been shown in the literature that the generalized
   Euler sequences (also known as Davenport sequences) provide a universal
   set of attitude representations. However, while these works assert the
   existence of generalized Euler angles for a given attitude, they do not
   provide explicit ranges that those angles must lie within. In addition,
   they do not generally provide physical insight into what a generalized
   Euler sequence is. This paper addresses these two points. As such, this
   paper contains a comprehensive self-contained treatment of generalized
   Euler sequences. In particular, a constructive approach is taken to
   proving that the generalized Euler sequences provide a universal set of
   attitude representations. In doing so, specific ranges that contain the
   generalized Euler angles are obtained, and physical insight is provided
   into the generalized Euler sequences. The singularity of the generalized
   Euler sequences is characterized, and it is shown that the generalized
   Euler angles are uniquely specified within their restricted ranges when
   away from the singularity condition.}},

Abstract = {{Sequential detection problems in sensor networks are considered. The
   true state of nature/true hypothesis is modeled as a binary random
   variable H with known prior distribution. There are N sensors making
   noisy observations about the hypothesis; N = \{1, 2,..., N\} denotes the
   set of sensors. Sensor i can receive messages from a subset P-i subset
   of N of sensors and send a message to a subset C-i subset of N. Each
   sensor is faced with a stopping problem. At each time t, based on the
   observations, it has taken so far and the messages it may have received,
   sensor i can decide to stop and communicate a binary decision to the
   sensors in C-i, or it can continue taking observations and receiving
   messages. After sensor i's binary decision has been sent, it becomes
   inactive. Sensors incur operational costs (cost of taking observations,
   communication costs, etc.) while they are active. In addition, the
   system incurs a terminal cost that depends on the true hypothesis H, the
   sensors' binary decisions, and their stopping times. The objective is to
   determine decision strategies for all sensors to minimize the total
   expected cost. Even though sensors only communicate their final
   decisions, there is implicit communication every time a sensor decides
   not to stop. This implicit communication through decisions is referred
   to as signaling. The general communication structure results in complex
   signaling opportunities in our problem. Despite the generality of our
   model and the complexity of signaling involved, it is shown that the a
   sensor's posterior belief on the hypothesis ( conditioned on its
   observations and received messages) and its received messages constitute
   a sufficient statistic for decision making and that all signaling
   possibilities are effectively captured by a 4-threshold decision rule
   where the thresholds depend on received messages.}},

Abstract = {{Natural gas transmission pipelines are complex systems whose flow
   characteristics are governed by challenging nonlinear physical behavior.
   These pipelines extend over hundreds and even thousands of miles. Gas is
   typically injected into the system at a constant rate, and a series of
   compressors is distributed along the pipeline to boost the gas pressure
   to maintain system pressure and throughput. These compressors consume a
   portion of the gas, and one goal of the operator is to control the
   compressor operation to minimize this consumption while satisfying
   pressure constraints at the gas load points. The optimization of these
   operations is computationally challenging. Many pipelines simply rely on
   the intuition and prior experience of operators to make these decisions.
   Here, we present a new geometric programming approach for optimizing
   compressor operation in natural gas pipelines. Using models of real
   natural gas pipelines, we show that the geometric programming algorithm
   consistently outperforms approaches that mimic the existing state of
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless power transfer (WPT) using magnetic resonance is the technology
   which could set human free from the annoying wires. In fact, the WPT
   adopts the same basic theory which has already been developed for at
   least 30 years with the term inductive power transfer. WPT technology is
   developing rapidly in recent years. At kilowatts power level, the
   transfer distance increases from several millimeters to several hundred
   millimeters with a grid to load efficiency above 90\%. The advances make
   the WPT very attractive to the electric vehicle (EV) charging
   applications in both stationary and dynamic charging scenarios. This
   paper reviewed the technologies in the WPT area applicable to EV
   wireless charging. By introducing WPT in EVs, the obstacles of charging
   time, range, and cost can be easily mitigated. Battery technology is no
   longer relevant in the mass market penetration of EVs. It is hoped that
   researchers could be encouraged by the state-of-the-art achievements,
   and push forward the further development of WPT as well as the expansion
   of EV.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a balance-constrained stochastic bottleneck spanning tree
   problem (BCSBSTP) where edge weights are independently distributed but
   may follow arbitrary continuous distributions. The goal is to minimize a
   threshold variable that may be exceeded by the maximum edge weight at
   certain risk, subject to the minimum edge weight being no less than a
   fixed threshold with a probability guarantee. We characterize these two
   requirements as chance constraints, which are typically used for
   bounding the risk of undesirable random outcomes. Given independently
   distributed edge weights, we reformulate BCSBSTP as a mixed-integer
   nonlinear program, approximated by two mixed-integer linear programs
   based on special ordered set of type one (SOS1) and special ordered set
   of type two (SOS2) variables. By relaxing the probabilistic guarantee on
   the minimum edge weight in BCSBSTP, we also consider a stochastic
   bottleneck spanning tree problem (SBSTP), of which optimal tree
   solutions are approximated via a bisection algorithm in pseudopolynomial
   time. We demonstrate computational results of our models and algorithms
   by testing randomly generated instances with edge weights following a
   diverse set of independent distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Despite growing computational and sensing power, naval structural design
   and analysis remains focused minimizing structural system weight while
   ensuring that estimated stress levels remain below allowable thresholds.
   While this approach allows the rapid design of new vessels that meet
   existing structural requirements, it struggles to fulfill the U.S.
   Navy's growing need for lifecycle support of aging assets. To address
   these new tasks, extensions of current structural analysis and design
   tools are required. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for
   managing fatigue cracks on aging assets by extending traditional
   design-stage approaches with Bayesian network-based model updating. A
   methodology of updating structural load estimates that is able to
   account for changing operational profiles is presented, allowing future
   fatigue loading to be predicted with increased confidence. A Dynamic
   Bayesian Network (DBN) approach is taken to represent the time-varying
   growth of fatigue cracks, including both shipboard inspection data and
   the updated loading. A robust reliability formulation is used to predict
   future crack growth risks based on the DBN formulation and the
   inspection data-to-date. An example is presented for a hypothetical
   sealift vessel. Finally, a discussion of the implications of such models
   on Navy design practice, operations, and maintenance is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional velocity and temperature fields surrounding an
   isolated thermal plume in a fluid with temperature-dependent viscosity
   are measured using Particle-Image Velocimetry and thermochromatic liquid
   crystals, respectively. The experimental conditions are relevant to a
   plume rising through the mantle. It is shown that while the velocity and
   the isotherm surrounding the plume can be used to visualize the plume,
   they do not reveal the finer details of its structure. However, by
   computing the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent fields from the velocity
   measurements, the material lines of the flow can be found, which clearly
   identify the shape of the plume head and characterize the behavior of
   the flow along the plume stem. It is shown that the vast majority of the
   material in the plume head has undergone significant stretching and
   originates from a wide region very low in the fluid domain, which is
   proposed as a contributing factor to the small-scale isotopic
   variability observed in ocean-island basalt regions. Lastly, the
   Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent fields are used to calculate the steady
   state rise velocity of the thermal plume, which is found to scale
   linearly with the Rayleigh number, in contrast to some previous work.
   The possible cause and the significance of these conflicting results are
   discussed, and it is suggested that the scaling relationship may be
   affected by the temperature-dependence of the fluid viscosity in the
   current work.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the potential for aggregations of residential
   thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as air conditioners, to
   arbitrage intraday wholesale electricity market prices via
   non-disruptive load control. We present two arbitrage approaches: 1) a
   benchmark that gives us an optimal policy but requires local computation
   or real-time communication and 2) an alternative based on a thermal
   energy storage model, which relies on less computation/communication
   infrastructure, but is suboptimal. We find that the alternative approach
   achieves around 60\%-80\% of the optimal wholesale energy cost savings.
   We use this approach to compute practical upper bounds for savings via
   arbitrage with air conditioners in California's intraday energy market.
   We investigate six sites over four years and find that the savings range
   from \$2-\$37 per TCL per year, and depend upon outdoor temperature
   statistics and price volatility.}},

Title = {{Stochastic assessment of climate impacts on hydrology and geomorphology

Abstract = {{Hydrologic and geomorphic responses of watersheds to changes in climate
   are difficult to assess due to projection uncertainties and nonlinearity
   of the processes that are involved. Yet such assessments are
   increasingly needed and call for mechanistic approaches within a
   probabilistic framework. This study employs an integrated
   hydrology-geomorphology model, the Triangulated Irregular Network-based
   Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS)-Erosion, to analyze runoff
   and erosion sensitivity of seven semiarid headwater basins to projected
   climate conditions. The Advanced Weather Generator is used to produce
   two climate ensembles representative of the historic and future climate
   conditions for the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed located in the
   southwest U.S. The former ensemble incorporates the stochastic
   variability of the observed climate, while the latter includes the
   stochastic variability and the uncertainty of multimodel climate change
   projections. The ensembles are used as forcing for tRIBS-Erosion that
   simulates runoff and sediment basin responses leading to probabilistic
   inferences of future changes. The results show that annual precipitation
   for the area is generally expected to decrease in the future, with lower
   hourly intensities and similar daily rates. The smaller hourly rainfall
   generally results in lower mean annual runoff. However, a non-negligible
   probability of runoff increase in the future is identified, resulting
   from stochastic combinations of years with low and high runoff. On
   average, the magnitudes of mean and extreme events of sediment yield are
   expected to decrease with a very high probability. Importantly, the
   projected variability of annual sediment transport for the future
   conditions is comparable to that for the historic conditions, despite
   the fact that the former account for a much wider range of possible
   climate alternatives. This result demonstrates that the historic natural
   climate variability of sediment yield is already so high, that it is
   comparable to the variability for a projected and highly uncertain
   future. Additionally, changes in the scaling relationship between
   specific sediment yield/runoff and drainage basin area are detected.}},

Abstract = {{In high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy, an ultrasound beam
   is focused within the body to locally affect the targeted site without
   damaging intervening tissues. The most common HIFU regime is thermal
   ablation. Recently there has been increasing interest in generating
   purely mechanical lesions in tissue (histotripsy). This paper provides
   an overview of several studies on the development of histotripsy methods
   toward clinical applications. Two histotripsy approaches and examples of
   their applications are presented. In one approach, sequences of
   high-amplitude, short (microsecond-long), focused ultrasound pulses
   periodically produce dense, energetic bubble clouds that mechanically
   disintegrate tissue. In an alternative approach, longer
   (millisecond-long) pulses with shock fronts generate boiling bubbles and
   the interaction of shock fronts with the resulting vapour cavity causes
   tissue disintegration. Recent preclinical studies on histotripsy are
   reviewed for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), liver and
   kidney tumours, kidney stone fragmentation, enhancing anti-tumour immune
   response, and tissue decellularisation for regenerative medicine
   applications. Potential clinical advantages of the histotripsy methods
   are discussed. Histotripsy methods can be used to mechanically ablate a
   wide variety of tissues, whilst selectivity sparing structures such as
   large vessels. Both ultrasound and MR imaging can be used for targeting
   and monitoring the treatment in real time. Although the two approaches
   utilise different mechanisms for tissue disintegration, both have many
   of the same advantages and offer a promising alternative method of
   non-invasive surgery.}},

Abstract = {{With advances in telecommunications, an increasing number of services
   rely on high data rate spectrum access. These critical services include
   banking, telemedicine, and exchange of technical information. As a
   result, spectrum resources are in ever-greater demand and the radio
   spectrum has become overly crowded. For efficient usage of spectrum,
   smart or cognitive radios are sought after. However, current wireless
   phones can only select a few specific bands. In this paper, we discuss
   the advantages of reconfigurable radios in not only increasing the
   efficiency of spectrum usage but also in potentially reducing the cost
   of wireless handsets and the barriers for new wireless service providers
   to enter the market. We review available technologies that make the
   implementation of reconfigurable radios possible and discuss technical
   challenges that need to be overcome before multistandard reconfigurable
   radios are put into practice. We also evaluate the ability of
   reconfigurable radios in reducing entry costs for new competitors in
   wireless service.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporating electric vehicles into smart grid, vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)
   makes it feasible to charge for large-scale electric vehicles, and in
   turn support electric vehicles, as mobile and distributed storage units,
   to discharge to smart grid. In order to provide reliable and efficient
   services, the operator of V2G networks needs to monitor real-time status
   of every plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) and then evaluate current
   electricity storage capability. Anonymity, aggregation and dynamic
   management are three basic but crucial characteristics of which the
   services of V2G networks should be. However, few of existing
   authentication schemes for V2G networks could satisfy them
   simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient
   authentication scheme with privacy-preserving for V2G networks. The
   scheme makes the charging/discharging station authenticate PEVs
   anonymously and manage them dynamically. Moreover, the monitoring data
   collected by the charging/discharging station could be sent to a local
   aggregator (LAG) in batch mode. In particular, time overheads during
   verification stage are independent with the number of involved PEVs, and
   there is no need to update the membership certificate and key pair
   before PEV logs out.}},

Abstract = {{Unsteady, nonlinear aerodynamics at high angles of attack challenges
   small unmanned aircraft system autopilots that rely heavily on
   inertial-based instrumentation. This work introduces an expanded
   aerodynamic sensing system for poststall flight conditions that
   incorporate high angle of attack and prop-wash aerodynamic forces based
   on in-flight measurement. A flight vehicle with a 1.8 m wingspan is used
   in wind-tunnel tests to measure the pitch and yaw moments due to free
   stream and prop-wash over the tail surfaces at high-thrust, low-airspeed
   conditions including hover. Test data are used to develop two methods to
   determine in-flight real-time pitch and yaw moments: a probe designed
   specifically to measure prop-wash flow and a set of pressure sensors
   embedded throughout the tail surfaces. Through comparisons with
   torque-transducer measurements also acquired in the wind-tunnel tests,
   both methods are shown to provide accurate moment estimates at hover and
   forward-flight conditions. With information directly provided by
   in-flight measurement, real-time pitch and yaw control can be enhanced

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the coupling of magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT),
   sausage, and kink modes in an imploding cylindrical liner, using ideal
   MHD. A uniform axial magnetic field of arbitrary value is included in
   each region: liner, its interior, and its exterior. The dispersion
   relation is solved exactly, for arbitrary radial acceleration (-g),
   axial wavenumber (k), azimuthal mode number (m), liner aspect ratio, and
   equilibrium quantities in each region. For small k, a positive g (inward
   radial acceleration in the lab frame) tends to stabilize the sausage
   mode, but destabilize the kink mode. For large k, a positive g
   destabilizes both the kink and sausage mode. Using the 1D-HYDRA
   simulation results for an equilibrium model that includes a pre-existing
   axial magnetic field and a pre-heated fuel, we identify several stages
   of MRT-sausage-kink mode evolution. We find that the m = 1 kink-MRT mode
   has a higher growth rate at the initial stage and stagnation stage of
   the implosion, and that the m = 0 sausage-MRT mode dominates at the main
   part of implosion. This analysis also sheds light on a puzzling feature

Title = {{A device for rapid and quantitative measurement of cardiac myocyte
   contractility}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cardiac contractility is the hallmark of cardiac function and is a
   predictor of healthy or diseased cardiac muscle. Despite advancements
   over the last two decades, the techniques and tools available to
   cardiovascular scientists are limited in their utility to accurately and
   reliably measure the amplitude and frequency of cardiomyocyte
   contractions. Isometric force measurements in the past have entailed
   cumbersome attachment of isolated and permeabilized cardiomyocytes to a
   force transducer followed by measurements of sarcomere lengths under
   conditions of submaximal and maximal Ca2+ activation. These techniques
   have the inherent disadvantages of being labor intensive and costly. We
   have engineered a micro-machined cantilever sensor with an embedded
   deflection-sensing element that, in preliminary experiments, has
   demonstrated to reliably measure cardiac cell contractions in real-time.
   Here, we describe this new bioengineering tool with applicability in the
   cardiovascular research field to effectively and reliably measure
   cardiac cell contractility in a quantitative manner. We measured
   contractility in both primary neonatal rat heart cardiomyocyte
   monolayers that demonstrated a beat frequency of 3 Hz as well as human
   embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes with a contractile frequency
   of about 1 Hz. We also employed the beta-adrenergic agonist
   isoproterenol (100 nmol l(-1)) and observed that our cantilever
   demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting subtle changes in both
   chronotropic and inotropic responses of monolayers. This report
   describes the utility of our microdevice in both basic cardiovascular
   research as well as in small molecule drug discovery to monitor cardiac
   cell contractions. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Often engineered systems entail randomness as a function of spatial (or
   temporal) variables. The random field can be found in the form of
   geometry, material property, and/or loading in engineering products and
   processes. In some applications, consideration of the random field is a
   key to accurately predict variability in system performances. However,
   existing methods for random field modeling are limited for practical use
   because they require sufficient field data. This paper thus proposes a
   new random field modeling method using a Bayesian Copula that
   facilitates the random field modeling with insufficient field data and
   applies this method for engineering probability analysis and robust
   design optimization. The proposed method is composed of three key ideas:
   (i) determining the marginal distribution of random field realizations
   at each measurement location, (ii) determining optimal Copulas to model
   statistical dependence of the field realizations at different
   measurement locations, and (iii) modeling a joint probability density
   function of the random field. A mathematical problem was first employed
   for the purpose of demonstrating the accuracy of the random field
   modeling with insufficient field data. The second case study deals with
   the assembly process of a two-door refrigerator that challenges
   predicting the door assembly tolerance and minimizing the tolerance by
   designing the random field and parameter variables in the assembly
   process with insufficient random field data. It is concluded that the
   proposed random field modeling can be used to successfully conduct the
   probability analysis and robust design optimization with insufficient
   random field data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores a framework for topology optimization of
   multi-component sheet metal structures, such as those often used in the
   automotive industry. The primary reason for having multiple components
   in a structure is to reduce the manufacturing cost, which can become
   prohibitively expensive otherwise. Having a multi-component structure
   necessitates re-joining, which often comes at sacrifices in the assembly
   cost, weight and structural performance. The problem of designing a
   multi-component structure is thus posed in a multi-objective framework.
   Approaches to solve the problem may be classified into single and two
   stage approaches. Two-stage approaches start by focusing solely on
   structural performance in order to obtain optimal monolithic (single
   piece) designs, and then the decomposition into multiple components is
   considered without changing the base topology (identical to the
   monolithic design). Single-stage approaches simultaneously attempt to
   optimize both the base topology and its decomposition. Decomposition is
   an inherently discrete problem, and as such, non-gradient methods are
   needed for single-stage and second stage of two-stage approaches. This
   paper adopts an implicit formulation (level-sets) of the design
   variables, which significantly reduces the number of design variables
   needed in either single or two stage approaches. The number of design
   variables in the formulation is independent from the meshing size, which
   enables application of non-gradient methods to realistic designs. Test
   results of a short cantilever and an L-shaped bracket studies show
   reasonable success of both single and two stage approaches, with each
   approach having different merits.}},

Title = {{When Crowdsourcing Fails: A Study of Expertise on Crowdsourced Design
   Evaluation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Crowdsourced evaluation is a promising method of evaluating engineering
   design attributes that require human input. The challenge is to
   correctly estimate scores using a massive and diverse crowd,
   particularly when only a small subset of evaluators has the expertise to
   give correct evaluations. Since averaging evaluations across all
   evaluators will result in an inaccurate crowd evaluation, this paper
   benchmarks a crowd consensus model that aims to identify experts such
   that their evaluations may be given more weight. Simulation results
   indicate this crowd consensus model outperforms averaging when it
   correctly identifies experts in the crowd, under the assumption that
   only experts have consistent evaluations. However, empirical results
   from a real human crowd indicate this assumption may not hold even on a
   simple engineering design evaluation task, as clusters of consistently
   wrong evaluators are shown to exist along with the cluster of experts.
   This suggests that both averaging evaluations and a crowd consensus
   model that relies only on evaluations may not be adequate for
   engineering design tasks, accordingly calling for further research into
   methods of finding experts within the crowd.}},

Abstract = {{Background. There is disagreement as to whether patient stratification
   by a combination of diabetes, smoking, and genetic test results is
   useful for informing the frequency of dental prophylaxes.
   Methods. The authors appeal to basic tenets of clinical study design and
   statistical analysis of clinical investigations, and highlight how
   secondary ad hoc analyses, such as those of Diehl and colleagues, are
   frequently underpowered and inconclusive. They also provide evidence
   from numerous studies supporting the use of genetics to identify risk.
   Results. The authors believe the conclusions reached from their original
   analyses are valid and the analyses of Diehl and colleagues serve to
   simply reinforce the authors' specific intent of avoiding such
   underpowered analyses altogether with the Michigan Personalized
   Prevention Study.
   Conclusions. Until full genome sequencing in many people with highly
   specified disease phenotypes is feasible, experimental approaches based
   on biological findings and hypothesis testing should not be summarily
   discounted.
   Practical Implications. Stratification of patients to provide
   ``personalized{''} treatment remains an important, yet elusive, goal.
   The current debate serves to highlight the need for large, clinical
   utility studies that can adequately determine how phenotypic and
   genotypic data can be best used to improve oral health in the US

Abstract = {{Recently, a coil gun was brought to the attention of engineering
   community as electromagnetic alternative to the chemical launchers.
   Various studies were performed on coil gun systems focused on achieving
   the high muzzle velocity in military applications and for satellite
   launching. Most of these studies focused on improvement of muzzle
   velocity via increase in the size of the coil gun. Present paper
   describes the process of design optimization where the size of the coli
   gun system is restricted. The design of experiment approach utilizes the
   orthogonal array table that reduces the required number of experiments.
   The design of experiment is carried out with a commercial PIAnO tool,
   where the finite element analysis is performed at each experimental
   point. Then, Kriging model is created to achieve accurate approximation
   in problems of many design variables or strongly nonlinear model. The
   coil gun is optimally designed using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) as
   optimization technique. In order to verify the improvement of muzzle
   velocity by optimal design, the prototypes of coil gun system are
   manufactured and the experiments to launch the projectile are performed.}},

Abstract = {{Bone scaffolds for tissue regeneration require an optimal trade-off
   between biological and mechanical criteria. Optimal designs may be
   obtained using topology optimization (homogenization approach) and
   prototypes produced using additive manufacturing techniques. However,
   the process from design to manufacture remains a research challenge and
   will be a requirement of FDA design controls to engineering scaffolds.
   This work investigates how the design to manufacture chain affects the
   reproducibility of complex optimized design characteristics in the
   manufactured product. The design and prototypes are analyzed taking into
   account the computational assumptions and the final mechanical
   properties determined through mechanical tests. The scaffold is an
   assembly of unit-cells, and thus scale size effects on the mechanical
   response considering finite periodicity are investigated and compared
   with the predictions from the homogenization method which assumes in the
   limit infinitely repeated unit cells. Results show that a limited number
   of unit-cells (3-5 repeated on a side) introduce some scale-effects but
   the discrepancies are below 10\%. Higher discrepancies are found when
   comparing the experimental data to numerical simulations due to
   differences between the manufactured and designed scaffold feature
   shapes and sizes as well as micro-porosities introduced by the
   manufacturing process. However good regression correlations (R-2 > 0.85)
   were found between numerical and experimental values, with slopes close
   to 1 for 2 out of 3 designs. (C) 2015 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Highly Loaded Behavior of Kinesins Increases the Robustness of Transport
   Under High Resisting Loads}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Kinesins are nano-sized biological motors which walk by repeating a
   mechanochemical cycle. A single kinesin molecule is able to transport
   its cargo about 1 mu m in the absence of external loads. However,
   kinesins perform much longer range transport in cells by working
   collectively. This long range of transport by a team of kinesins is
   surprising because the motion of the cargo in cells can be hindered by
   other particles. To reveal how the kinesins are able to accomplish their
   tasks of transport in harsh intracellular circumstances, stochastic
   studies on the kinesin motion are performed by considering the binding
   and unbinding of kinesins to microtubules and their dependence on the
   force acting on kinesin molecules. The unbinding probabilities
   corresponding to each mechanochemical state of kinesin are modeled. The
   statistical characterization of the instants and locations of binding
   are captured by computing the probability of unbound kinesin being at
   given locations. It is predicted that a group of kinesins has a more
   efficient transport than a single kinesin from the perspective of
   velocity and run length. Particularly, when large loads are applied, the
   leading kinesin remains bound to the microtubule for long time which
   increases the chances of the other kinesins to bind to the microtubule.
   To predict effects of this behavior of the leading kinesin under large
   loads on the collective transport, the motion of the cargo is studied
   when the cargo confronts obstacles. The result suggests that the
   behavior of kinesins under large loads prevents the early termination of
   the transport which can be caused by the interference with the static or
   moving obstacles.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between colloidal building blocks-and their assemblies
   is an active field of research. As a strategy for targeting novel
   Crystal structures, we examine the use,of Voronoi particles, which are
   hard, space-filling particles in the shape of Voronoi cells of a target
   Structure. Although Voronoi particles stabilize their target structure
   in the limit of high pressure by construction, the thermodynamic
   assembly of the same structure at moderate pressure, close to the onset
   of crystallization, is not guaranteed. Indeed, we find that a more
   symmetric crystal is often-preferred due to additional entropic
   contributions arising from configurational or occupational degeneracy.
   We characterize the assembly behavior of the Voronoi particles in terms
   of the symmetries of the building blocks as well as the symmetries of
   crystal structures and demonstrate how controlling the degeneracies
   through a modification of particle shape and field-directed assembly can
   significantly improve the assembly propensity.}},

Abstract = {{The primary thrust of tissue engineering is the clinical translation of
   scaffolds and/or biologics to reconstruct tissue defects. Despite this
   thrust, clinical translation of tissue engineering therapies from
   academic research has been minimal in the 27 year history of tissue
   engineering. Academic research by its nature focuses on, and rewards,
   initial discovery of new phenomena and technologies in the basic
   research model, with a view towards generality. Translation, however, by
   its nature must be directed at specific clinical targets, also denoted
   as indications, with associated regulatory requirements. These
   regulatory requirements, especially design control, require that the
   clinical indication be precisely defined a priori, unlike most academic
   basic tissue engineering research where the research target is typically
   open-ended, and furthermore requires that the tissue engineering therapy
   be constructed according to design inputs that ensure it treats or
   mitigates the clinical indication. Finally, regulatory approval dictates
   that the constructed system be verified, i.e., proven that it meets the
   design inputs, and validated, i.e., that by meeting the design inputs
   the therapy will address the clinical indication. Satisfying design
   control requires (1) a system of integrated technologies (scaffolds,
   materials, biologics), ideally based on a fundamental platform, as
   compared to focus on a single technology, (2) testing of design
   hypotheses to validate system performance as opposed to mechanistic
   hypotheses of natural phenomena, and (3) sequential testing using in
   vitro, in vivo, large preclinical and eventually clinical tests against
   competing therapies, as compared to single experiments to test new
   technologies or test mechanistic hypotheses. Our goal in this paper is
   to illustrate how design control may be implemented in academic
   translation of scaffold based tissue engineering therapies.
   Specifically, we propose to (1) demonstrate a modular platform approach
   founded on 3D printing for developing tissue engineering therapies and
   (2) illustrate the design control process for modular implementation of
   two scaffold based tissue engineering therapies: airway reconstruction
   and bone tissue engineering based spine fusion.}},

Abstract = {{In some applications, multiple measurements are available, but the
   driving input that gives rise to those outputs may be unknown. This
   raises the question as to whether it is possible to model the response

   develop time-domain sensor-to-sensor models that account for nonzero
   initial conditions. The sensor-to-sensor model is in the form of a
   transmissibility operator that is a rational function of the
   differentiation operator. The development is carried out for both SISO
   and MIMO transmissibility operators. These time-domain sensor-to-sensor
   models can be used for diagnostics and output prediction. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This work describes a novel architecture to realize high-performance
   gallium nitride (GaN) bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators. The method is
   based on the growth of a thick GaN layer on a metal electrode grid. The
   fabrication process starts with the growth of a thin GaN buffer layer on
   a Si (111) substrate. The GaN buffer layer is patterned and trenches are
   made and refilled with sputtered tungsten (W)/silicon dioxide (SiO2)
   forming passivated metal electrode grids. GaN is then regrown,
   nucleating from the exposed GaN seed layer and coalescing to form a
   thick GaN device layer. A metal electrode can be deposited and patterned
   on top of the GaN layer. This method enables vertical piezoelectric
   actuation of the GaN layer using its largest piezoelectric coefficient
   (d(33)) for thickness-mode resonance. Having a bottom electrode also
   results in a higher coupling coefficient, useful for the implementation
   of acoustic filters. Growth of GaN on Si enables releasing the device
   from the frontside using isotropic xenon difluoride (XeF2) etch and
   therefore eliminating the need for backside lithography and etching.}},

Title = {{Analysis of yellow-light running at signalized intersections using
   high-resolution traffic data}},

Abstract = {{Many accidents occurring at signalized intersections are closely related
   to drivers' decisions of running through intersections during yellow
   light, i.e., yellow-light running (YLR). Therefore it is important to
   understand the relationships between YLR and the factors which
   contribute to drivers' decision of YLR. This requires collecting a large
   amount of YLR cases. However, existing data collection method, which
   mainly relies on video cameras, has difficulties to collect a large
   amount of YLR data. In this research, we propose a method to study
   drivers' YLR behaviors using high-resolution event-based data from
   signal control systems. We used 8 months' high-resolution data collected
   by two stop-bar detectors at a signalized intersection located in
   Minnesota and identified over 30,000 YLR cases. To identify the possible
   reasons for drivers' decision of YLR, this research further categorized
   the YLR cases into four types: ``in should-go zone{''}, ``in should-stop
   zone{''}, ``in dilemma zone{''}, and ``in optional zone{''} according to
   the driver's location when signal turns to yellow. Statistical analysis
   indicates that the mean values of approaching speed and acceleration
   rate are significantly different for different types of YLR. We also
   show that there were about 10\% of YLR drivers who cannot run through
   intersection before traffic light turns to red. Furthermore, based on a
   strong correlation between hourly traffic volume and number of YLR
   events, this research developed a regression model that can be used to
   predict the number of YLR events based on hourly flow rate. This
   research also showed that snowing weather conditions cause more YLR
   events. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Designing robust and resilient retail networks under operational and
   disruption risks can create substantial competitive advantage. In this
   paper, a deterministic multiple set-covering model is first proposed.
   Then, it is extended to a possibilistic scenario-based robust model by
   scenario generation and disruption profiling to design a robust and
   resilient retail network. The developed models are validated through
   randomly generated examples and a real case study in retailing.
   Numerical results demonstrate that designing retail chains without
   considering operational and disruption risks is really misleading. Also,
   multiple covering of retail stores as the measure of redundancy
   increases the network's resilience significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Research described in this paper targeted a cascade system for the
   hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol via formic acid and/or formate
   intermediates, a reaction sequence that has been accomplished previously
   using homogeneous catalysts. On the basis of results for the
   hydrogenation of CO2, formic acid, and ethyl formate over a series of
   Cu- and Mo2C-based catalysts, we selected a Cu chromite catalyst for CO2
   hydrogenation to the formate and a Cu/Mo2C catalyst to convert the
   formate to methanol. These catalysts worked cooperatively in the
   presence of ethanol, yielding a methanol turnover frequency of 4.7 x
   10(-4) s(-1) at 135 degrees C, 10 bar of CO2, and 30 bar of H-2 in
   1,4-dioxane. The performance for this Cu chromite:Cu/Mo2C cascade system
   surpassed the additive production of the individual catalysts by similar
   to 60\%. The results also allowed an investigation of the reaction
   pathways. The hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid appeared to be the
   rate-limiting step for most of the catalysts. This is not surprising
   given the thermodynamics for this reaction. Finally, the hydrogenation
   of CO2 to dimethyl ether was also demonstrated using a system consisting
   of the Cu/Mo2C catalyst to produce methanol from CO2 and HZSM-5 to
   produce dimethyl ether from methanol. The systems described in this
   paper are, to our knowledge, the first demonstrating cascade CO2
   hydrogenation via heterogeneous catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Biologically related processes operate across multiple spatiotemporal
   scales. For computational modeling methodologies to mimic this
   biological complexity, individual scale models must be linked in ways
   that allow for dynamic exchange of information across scales. A powerful
   methodology is to combine a discrete modeling approach, agent-based
   models (ABMs), with continuum models to form hybrid models. Hybrid
   multi-scale ABMs have been used to simulate emergent responses of
   biological systems. Here, we review two aspects of hybrid multi-scale
   ABMs: linking individual scale models and efficiently solving the
   resulting model. We discuss the computational choices associated with
   aspects of linking individual scale models while simultaneously
   maintaining model tractability. We demonstrate implementations of
   existing numerical methods in the context of hybrid multi-scale ABMs.
   Using an example model describing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection,
   we show relative computational speeds of various combinations of
   numerical methods. Efficient linking and solution of hybrid multi-scale
   ABMs is key to model portability, modularity, and their use in
   understanding biological phenomena at a systems level.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{294-303}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{It is critical to alleviate problems of energy and air pollutants
   emissions in the metropolis because these areas serve as economic
   engines and have large and dense populations. Drivers of fossil fuel use
   and air pollutants emissions were analyzed in metropolis of Beijing
   during 1997-2010. The analyses were conducted from both a bottom-up and
   a top-down perspective based on the sectoral inventories and structural
   decomposition analysis (SDA). From a bottom-up perspective, the key
   energy-intensive industrial sectors directly caused the variations in
   Beijing's air pollution by means of a series of energy and economic
   policies. From a top-down perspective, variations in production
   structures caused increases in most materials during 2000-2010, but
   there were decreases in PM10 and PM2.5 emissions during 2005-2010.
   Population growth was found to be the largest driver of energy
   consumption and air pollutants emissions during 1997-2010. This finding
   suggests that avoiding rapid population growth in Beijing could
   simultaneously control energy consumptions and air pollutants emissions.
   Mitigation policies should consider not only the key industrial sectors
   but also socioeconomic drivers to co-reduce energy consumption and air
   pollutions in China's metropolis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The minimum detectable dose (MDD) limit was examined in four different
   ways for groups of LiF:Mg,Ti thermoluminescent dosimeters, and two ways
   for CaF2:Dy, CaF2:Tm, CaF2:Mn, and CaSO4:Dy dosimeters. All types were
   irradiated and read out at dose intervals from 8.8 mu Gy to 6.6 mGy.
   Dose response linearity was never lost even for the lowest dose tested.
   As an ideal MDD, the signal arising from a zero applied dose readout was
   compared to calibration from true doses, resulting in signal
   corresponding to 0.04-0.1 mu Gy. The effects of fading and high ambient
   radon exposure on the MDD were examined.}},

Title = {{DNA buckling in bacteriophage cavities as a mechanism to aid virus

Volume = {{189}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{251-258}},

Abstract = {{While relatively simple biologically, bacteriophages are sophisticated
   biochemical machines that execute a precise sequence of events during
   virus assembly, DNA packaging, and ejection. These stages of the viral
   life cycle require intricate coordination of viral components whose
   structures are being revealed by single molecule experiments and high
   resolution (cryo-electron microscopy) reconstructions. For example,
   during packaging, bacteriophages employ some of the strongest known
   molecular motors to package DNA against increasing pressure within the
   viral capsid shell. Located upstream of the motor is an elaborate portal
   system through which DNA is threaded. A high resolution reconstruction
   of the portal system for bacteriophage phi 29 reveals that DNA buckles
   inside a small cavity under large compressive forces. In this study, we
   demonstrate that DNA can also buckle in other bacteriophages including
   T7 and P22. Using a computational rod model for DNA, we demonstrate that
   a DNA buckle can initiate and grow within the small confines of a cavity
   under biologically-attainable force levels. The forces of DNA-cavity
   contact and DNA-DNA electrostatic repulsion ultimately limit cavity
   filling. Despite conforming to very different cavity geometries, the
   buckled DNA within T7 and P22 exhibits near equal volumetric energy
   density (similar to 1 kT/nm(3)) and energetic cost of packaging (similar
   to 22 kT). We hypothesize that a DNA buckle creates large forces on the
   cavity interior to signal the conformational changes to end packaging.
   In addition, a DNA buckle may help retain the genome prior to tail
   assembly through significantly increased contact area with the portal.

Abstract = {{This study examines the role of the microstructure and optical
   properties of InGaN/GaN nanowire LED structures on Si(111) having
   different nanowire coverages. Cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements show
   that all samples exhibit broad emission around the intended energy, 1.95
   eV (635 nm). While the absolute emission intensity is hard to compare
   for CL measurement, the bandgap emission (similar to 3.4 eV) coming from
   the GaN root is more pronounced as coverage of nanowires decreases,
   which has less coalescence formation. The width of the emission peak is
   likely due to variations in the morphology of the InGaN discs within the
   wires, as faceted layers with different thicknesses and quantum dots are
   observed by transmission electron microscopy. Nonepitaxial six-fold
   symmetric lateral branching, called nanocrowns, emanate from stacking
   faults within the active regions. These features likely reduce optical
   emission as a result of grain boundaries between the nanocrown and
   nanowire.}},

Abstract = {{In order to achieve a high level of performance, data intensive programs
   such as the real-time processing of surveillance feeds from unmanned
   aerial vehicles, genomics sequence comparison or large graph traversal
   require the strategic application of multi/many-core processors and
   co-processors using a hybrid of inter-process message passing (e.g. MPI
   and SHMEM) and intra-process threading (e.g. pthreads and OpenMP). To
   facilitate program and system design decisions, program runtime behavior
   gathered through binary instrumentation is useful because it enables
   inspection of the low-level interactions between a data intensive
   program and a multi-core processor or many-core co-processor. This work
   details two novel mechanisms in the PEBIL binary instrumentation
   platform that make it well-suited for analyzing data-intensive programs
   by providing (1) support for fast lookup of instrumentation thread-local
   storage (ITLS) and (2) support for the fast enabling and disabling of
   instrumentation at runtime as a methodology for supporting sampling.
   These features are compared to two other popular binary instrumentation
   platforms, Pin and Dyninst, in both analytical and empirical terms for
   programs implemented using the popular but disparate parallelization
   models MPI and OpenMP. Empirical comparisons are made for two binary
   instrumentation applications that are critical to the analysis of
   data-intensive programs, basic block counting and memory address trace
   collection. These empirical results show that PEBIL is unrivaled in
   terms of overhead for basic block counting, introducing an average of 18
   \% extra runtime for MPI programs and 116 \% for OpenMP programs as
   opposed to 60 \% (MPI) and 232 \% (OpenMP) for Pin and 20 \% (MPI) and
   14743 \% (OpenMP) for Dyninst. For memory address trace collection that
   makes use of the conventional optimization of sampling 10 \% of the
   memory addresses of a program to reduce processing time, PEBIL also
   introduces the lowest overheads of 144 \% (MPI) and 222 \% (OpenMP)
   compared to 313 \% (MPI) and 360 \% (OpenMP) with Pin and 1113 \% (MPI)
   and 89075 \% (OpenMP) with Dyninst.}},

   10(5.81)-10(7.32) copies mL(-1)) than they were in other seasons, and
   tetW, tetX, and sul1 reached its lowest concentration in autumn
   (10(4.61)-10(6.81) copies mL(-1)). The concentration of ARGs in
   wastewater decreased in the anaerobic effluent and anoxic effluent, but
   increased in the aerobic effluent, and then sharply declined in the MBR
   effluent. The reduction of tetW, intI1, and sul1 was all significantly
   positively correlated with the reduction of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in
   the wastewater treatment process (p < 0.01). The concentration of ARGs
   (copies mg(-1)) in sludge samples increased along the treatment process,
   but the abundance of five ARGs (ratio of ARGs to 16S rDNA) remained the
   same from anaerobic to anoxic to aerobic basins, while an increment
   ratio in MBR was observed for all ARGs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a circuit in which tungsten oxide-based analog
   memristors are post-processed on a CMOS-based Field-Programmable Analog
   Array Integrated Circuit (FPAA-IC). FPAAs are powerful tools for rapid
   analog experimentation, prototyping and power-efficient computing, and
   they allow custom analog circuits to be built and reconfigured. The
   primary motivation for this work is to introduce and demonstrate the
   operation of the FPAA/memristor hybrid circuit and the board-level
   infrastructure, and to form a basis for subsequent empirical work on
   analog memristive computing. The experiments shown in this paper
   demonstrate a successful fabrication of memristors on the FPAA
   substrate, and the usefulness of the hybrid computing infrastructure in
   terms of experimentation with memristors. The experiments suggest that a
   single state variable cannot capture the adaptation of a memristor. To
   this end, a SPICE compatible memristor model with two state variables is
   presented. Furthermore, a memristor-based adaptive coincidence detector
   is demonstrated on the FPAA/Memristor computing infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{The reliability assessment of a large-scale system that considers its
   units' degradation is challenging due to the resulting dimensionality
   problem. We propose a new methodology that allows us to overcome
   difficulties in analyzing large-scale system dynamics, and devise
   analytical methods for finding the multivariate distribution of the
   dynamically changing system condition. When each unit's degradation
   condition can be classified into a finite number of states, and the
   transition distribution from one state to another is known, we obtain
   the asymptotic distribution of the number of units at each degradation
   state using fluid and diffusion limits. Specifically, we use a uniform
   acceleration technique, and obtain the time-varying mean vector and the
   covariance matrix of the number of units at multiple degradation states.
   When a state transition follows a non-Markovian deterioration process,
   we integrate phase-type distribution approximations with the fluid and
   diffusion limits. We show that, with any transition time distributions,
   the distribution of the number of units at multiple degradation
   conditions can be approximated by the multivariate Gaussian distribution
   as the total number of units gets large. The analytical results enable
   us to perform probabilistic assessment of the system condition during
   the system's service life. Our numerical studies suggest that the
   proposed methods can accurately characterize the stochastic evolution of
   the system condition over time.}},

Abstract = {{In the natural world, legged animals regularly run across uneven terrain
   with remarkable ease. To gain understanding of how running on uneven
   terrain affects the biomechanics and energetics of locomotion, we
   studied human subjects (N=12) running at 2.3 m s(-1) on an uneven
   terrain treadmill, with up to a 2.5 cm height variation. We hypothesized
   that running on uneven terrain would show increased energy expenditure,
   step parameter variability and leg stiffness compared with running on
   smooth terrain. Subject energy expenditure increased by 5\% (0.68 W
   kg(-1); P<0.05) when running on uneven terrain compared with smooth
   terrain. Step width and length variability also increased by 27\% and
   26\%, respectively (P<0.05). Positive and negative ankle work decreased
   on uneven terrain by 22\% (0.413 J kg(-1)) and 18\% (0.147 J kg(-1)),
   respectively (P=0.0001 and P=0.0008). Mean muscle activity increased on
   uneven terrain for three muscles in the thigh (P<0.05). Leg stiffness
   also increased by 20\% (P<0.05) during running on uneven terrain
   compared with smooth terrain. Calculations of gravitational potential
   energy fluctuations suggest that about half of the energetic increases
   can be explained by additional positive and negative mechanical work for
   up and down steps on the uneven surface. This is consistent between
   walking and running, as the absolute increases in energetic cost for
   walking and running on uneven terrain were similar: 0.68 and 0.48 W
   kg(-1), respectively. These results provide insight into how surface
   smoothness can affect locomotion biomechanics and energetics in the real
   world.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{522}},

Abstract = {{We present a state-of-the-art holistic, multi-scale dynamic downscaling
   approach suited to address climate change impacts on hydrologic metrics
   and hydraulic regime of surface flow at the ``scale of human
   decisions{''} in ungauged basins. The framework rests on stochastic and
   physical downscaling techniques that permit one-way crossing 10(6)-10(0)
   m scales, with a specific emphasis on `nesting' hydraulic assessments
   within a coarser-scale hydrologic model. Future climate projections for
   the location of Manchester watershed (MI) are obtained from an ensemble
   of General Circulation Models of the 3rd phase of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project database and downscaled to a ``point{''} scale
   using a weather generator. To represent the natural variability of
   historic and future Climates, we generated continuous time series of 300
   years for the locations of 3 meteorological stations located in the
   vicinity of the ungauged basin. To make such a multi-scale approach
   computationally feasible, we identified the months of May and August as
   the periods of specific interest based on ecohydrologic considerations.
   Analyses of historic and future simulation results for the identified
   periods show that the same median rainfall obtained by accounting for
   climate natural variability triggers hydrologically-mediated
   non-uniqueness in flow variables resolved at the hydraulic scale. An
   emerging challenge is that uncertainty initiated at the hydrologic scale
   is not necessarily preserved at smaller-scale flow variables, because of
   non-linearity of underlying physical processes, which ultimately can
   mask climate uncertainty. We stress the necessity of augmenting
   climate-level uncertainties of emission scenario, multi-model, and
   natural variability with uncertainties arising due to non-linearities in
   smaller-scale processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To study cell-to-cell interactions, there has been a continuous demand
   on developing microsystems for trapping pairs of two different cells in
   microwell arrays. Here, we propose an L-shaped microwell (L-microwell)
   array that relies on the elasticity of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   substrate for trapping and pairing heterogeneous cells. We designed an
   L-microwell suitable for trapping single cell in each branch via
   stretching/releasing the PDMS substrate, and also performed 3D
   time-dependent diffusion simulations to visualize how cell-secreted
   molecules diffuse in the L-microwell and communicate with the partner
   cell. The computational results showed that the secreted molecule first
   contacted the partner cell after 35 min, and the secreted molecule fully
   covered the partner cell in 4 h (when referenced to 10\% of the secreted
   molecular concentration). The molecules that diffused to the outside of
   the L-microwell were significantly diluted by the bulk solution, which
   prevented unwanted cellular communication between neighboring
   L-microwells. We produced over 5000 cell pairs in one 2.25 cm(2) array
   with about 30 000 L-microwells. The proposed L-microwell array offers a
   versatile and convenient cell pairing method to investigate cell-to-cell

Title = {{Computer aided detection of surgical retained foreign object for

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1213-1222}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Surgical retained foreign objects (RFOs) have significant
   morbidity and mortality. They are associated with approximately
   \$1.5x10(9) annually in preventable medical costs. The detection
   accuracy of radiographs for RFOs is a mediocre 59\%. The authors address
   the RFO problem with two complementary technologies: a three-dimensional
   (3D) gossypiboma micro tag, the mu Tag that improves the visibility of
   RFOs on radiographs, and a computer aided detection (CAD) system that
   detects the mu Tag. It is desirable for the CAD system to operate in a
   high specificity mode in the operating room (OR) and function as a first
   reader for the surgeon. This allows for fast point of care results and
   seamless workflow integration. The CAD system can also operate in a high
   sensitivity mode as a second reader for the radiologist to ensure the
   highest possible detection accuracy.
   Methods: The 3D geometry of the mu Tag produces a similar two
   dimensional (2D) depiction on radiographs regardless of its orientation
   in the human body and ensures accurate detection by a radiologist and
   the CAD. The authors created a data set of 1800 cadaver images with the
   3D mu Tag and other common man-made surgical objects positioned
   randomly. A total of 1061 cadaver images contained a single mu Tag and
   the remaining 739 were without mu Tag. A radiologist marked the location
   of the mu Tag using an in-house developed graphical user interface. The
   data set was partitioned into three independent subsets: a training set,
   a validation set, and a test set, consisting of 540, 560, and 700
   images, respectively. A CAD system with modules that included
   preprocessing mu Tag enhancement, labeling, segmentation, feature
   analysis, classification, and detection was developed. The CAD system
   was developed using the training and the validation sets.
   Results: On the training set, the CAD achieved 81.5\% sensitivity with
   0.014 false positives (FPs) per image in a high specificity mode for the
   surgeons in the OR and 96.1\% sensitivity with 0.81 FPs per image in a
   high sensitivity mode for the radiologists. On the independent test set,
   the CAD achieved 79.5\% sensitivity with 0.003 FPs per image in a high
   specificity mode for the surgeons and 90.2\% sensitivity with 0.23 FPs
   per image in a high sensitivity mode for the radiologists.
   Conclusions: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first
   time a 3D mu Tag is used to produce a recognizable, substantially
   similar 2D projection on radiographs regardless of orientation in space.
   It is the first time a CAD system is used to search for man-made objects
   over anatomic background. The CAD system for the mu Tags achieved
   reasonable performance in both the high specificity and the high
   sensitivity modes. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in

Title = {{Au nanostructure arrays for plasmonic applications: annealed island
   films versus nanoimprint lithography}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper attempts to compare the main features of random and highly
   ordered gold nanostructure arrays (NSA) prepared by thermally annealed
   island film and nanoimprint lithography (NIL) techniques, respectively.
   Each substrate possesses different morphology in terms of plasmonic
   enhancement. Both methods allow such important features as spectral
   tuning of plasmon resonance position depending on size and shape of
   nanostructures; however, the time and cost is quite different. The
   respective comparison was performed experimentally and theoretically for
   a number of samples with different geometrical parameters. Spectral
   characteristics of fabricated NSA exhibited an expressed plasmon peak in
   the range from 576 to 809 nm for thermally annealed samples and from 606
   to 783 nm for samples prepared by NIL. Modelling of the optical response
   for nanostructures with typical shapes associated with these techniques
   (parallelepiped for NIL and semi-ellipsoid for annealed island films)
   was performed using finite-difference time-domain calculations.
   Mathematical simulations have indicated the dependence of electric field
   enhancement on the shape and size of the nanoparticles. As an important
   point, the distribution of electric field at so-called `hot spots' was
   considered. Parallelepiped-shaped nanoparticles were shown to yield
   maximal enhancement values by an order of magnitude greater than their
   semi-ellipsoid-shaped counterparts; however, both nanoparticle shapes
   have demonstrated comparable effective electrical field enhancement
   values. Optimized Au nanostructures with equivalent diameters ranging
   from 85 to 143 nm and height equal to 35 nm were obtained for both
   techniques, resulting in the largest electrical field enhancement. The
   application of island film thermal annealing method for nanochips
   fabrication can be considered as a possible cost-effective platform for
   various surface-enhanced spectroscopies; while the NIL-fabricated NSA
   looks like more effective for sensing of small-size objects.}},

Title = {{Design for flexibility: Evaluating the option to extend service life in
   preliminary structural design}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{68-78}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new type of real options analysis is used to evaluate
   the worth of an option to extend the service life (ESL options) of an
   aluminum structure from twenty to twenty-five years. It is an early
   application of prospect theory-based real options analysis (PB-ROA) in
   naval design. PB-ROA abstracts the principles of real options analysis
   to suit naval design applications where the assets do not generate cash
   flows, and therefor one cannot define value in monetary terms. Instead,
   the example in this paper defines the utility of a structural design
   based on three components: structural availability, cargo capacity, and
   producibility. The utility is contingent on risk factors like the time
   to crack initiation of a welding detail which is included using
   stochastic fatigue analysis. From an entire Pareto front of optimal
   structural designs, the options analysis exposes a partition in the
   design space which could be valuable in a design setting. The
   partitioning reveals the conditions in which certain candidate designs
   maximize the present value of future flexibility. Ultimately, this paper
   demonstrates a new approach to valuing flexibility in preliminary
   structural design that may generate useful insight for early stage
   decision makers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Growing heterotrophic algae in reactors with sugar as the energy and
   carbon source rather than sunlight and carbon dioxide is an approach
   being commercialized today. However, the full environmental impacts of
   this fuel pathway have not been explored. The objective of this analysis
   was to compare the life cycle impacts of algal biodiesel produced
   heterotrophically to a phototrophic pathway featuring algae grown in
   ponds. A third, hybrid approach utilizing algae capable of both
   phototrophy and heterotrophy was also explored. Sugar beet and sugarcane
   were examined as feedstocks for the heterotrophic process. The results
   indicate that a reduction in the global warming potential (GWP) and an
   improvement in the net energy ratio (NER) for algal biodiesel could be
   possible for the heterotrophic and hybrid pathways relative to the
   phototroplaic, but only if reactor cultivation can be performed
   efficiently and with sugarcane as the feedstock For example, the NER
   varies from 0.6 to 1.6 for the heterotrophic pathway, depending on
   reactor performance, compared to 1.3 for the phototrophic pathway. Sugar
   crops used as feedstocks for heterotrophic cultivation present concerns
   about land constraints that are less of an issue for the phototrophic
   pathway. No pathway presented a clear advantage for the water stress
   impact metric.}},

Abstract = {{A formal definition of brain-computer interface (BCI) is as follows: a
   system that acquires brain signal activity and translates it into an
   output that can replace, restore, enhance, supplement, or improve the
   existing brain signal, which can, in turn, modify or change ongoing
   interactions between the brain and its internal or external environment.
   More simply, a BCI can be defined as a system that translates ``brain
   signals into new kinds of outputs.{''} After brain signal acquisition,
   the BCI evaluates the brain signal and extracts signal features that
   have proven useful for task performance. There are 2 broad categories of
   BCIs: implantable and noninvasive, distinguished by invasively and
   noninvasively acquired brain signals, respectively. For this supplement,
   we will focus on BCIs that use noninvasively acquired brain signals. (C)

Abstract = {{Objectives: To identify perceptions among people with spinal cord injury
   (SCI) of the priorities for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications
   and design features along with the time investment and risk acceptable
   to obtain a BCI.
   Design: Survey.
   Setting: Research registry participants surveyed via telephone and BCI
   usage study participants surveyed in person before BCI use.
   Participants: Convenience sample of people with SCI (N=40), consisting
   of persons from the registry (n=30) and from the BCI study (n=10).
   Participants were classified as those with low function (n=24) and those
   with high function (n=16).
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Descriptive statistics of functional
   independence, living situations and support structures, ratings of
   importance of different task and design features, and acceptable levels
   of performance, risk, and time investment.
   Results: BCIs were of interest to 96\% of the low-function group.
   Emergency communication was the top priority task (ranked in the top 2
   by 43\%). The most important design features were ``functions the BCI
   provides{''} and ``simplicity of BCI setup.{''} Desired performance was
   90\% accuracy, with standby mode errors no more than once every 4 hours
   and speeds of more than 20 letters per minute. Dry electrodes were
   preferred over gel or implanted electrodes (P<.05). Median acceptable
   setup time was 10 to 20 minutes, satisfying 65\% of participants.
   Conclusions: People with low functional independence resulting from SCI
   have a strong interest in BCIs. Advances in speed and setup time will be
   required for BCIs to meet the desired performance. Creating BCI
   functions appropriate to the needs of those with SCI will be of ultimate
   importance for BCI acceptance with this population. (C) 2015 by the

Abstract = {{More than 300 researchers gathered at the 2013 International
   Brain-Computer Interface (BCI Meeting to discuss current practice and

   Virtual Users' Forum at the meeting to provide the BCI community with
   feedback from users. We report on the Virtual Users' Forum, including
   initial results from ongoing research being conducted by 2 BCI groups.
   Online surveys and in-person interviews were used to solicit feedback
   from people with disabilities who are expert and novice BCI users. For
   the Virtual Users' Forum, their responses were organized into 4 major
   themes: current (non-BCI) communication methods, experiences with BCI
   research, challenges of current BCIs, and future BCI developments. Two
   authors with severe disabilities gave presentations during the Virtual
   Users' Forum, and their comments are integrated with the other results.
   While participants' hopes for BCIs of the future remain high, their
   comments about available systems mirror those made by consumers about
   conventional assistive technology. They reflect concerns about
   reliability (eg, typing accuracy/speed), utility (eg, applications and
   the desire for real-time interactions), ease of use (eg, portability and
   system setup), and support (eg, technical support and caregiver
   training). People with disabilities, as target users of BCI systems, can
   provide valuable feedback and input on the development of BCI as an
   assistive technology. To this end, participatory action research should
   be considered as a valuable methodology for future BCI research. (C)

Abstract = {{In the design of hybrid vehicles, it is important to identify proper
   component sizes along with the optimal control. When the design search
   space is large, exhaustive optimal control strategies, such as dynamic
   programming (DP) is too time consuming to be used. Instead, a
   near-optimal method that is orders of magnitude faster than DP is
   needed. One such near-optimal method is developed and presented in this
   paper. This method is applied to identify the optimal powertrain
   parameters of all power-split hybrid configurations utilizing a single
   planetary gear. There are 12 possible configurations, six input and
   output splits, and each configuration has up to four modes. Based on the
   analysis of the efficiency of powertrain components of the four modes,
   and the power-weighted efficiency concept, we show that the computation
   time can be reduced by a factor of 10 000 without consequential
   performance compromise, compared with the DP approach. The optimal
   design of each configuration is analyzed and presented.}},

Abstract = {{Many physics-based models are used to study and monitor the terrestrial
   upper atmosphere. Each of these models has internal parameterizations
   that introduce bias if they are not tuned for a specific set of run
   conditions. This study uses Retrospective Cost Model Refinement (RCMR)
   to remove internal model bias in the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere
   Model (GITM) through parameter estimation. RCMR is a low-cost method
   that uses the error between truth data and a biased estimate to improve
   the biased model. Neutral mass density measurements are used to estimate
   an appropriate photoelectron heating efficiency, which is shown to drive
   the modeled thermosphere closer to the real thermosphere. Observations
   from the Challenging Mini-Payload (CHAMP) satellite taken under active
   and quiet solar conditions show that RCMR successfully drives the GITM
   thermospheric mass density to the observed values, removing model bias
   and appropriately accounting for missing physical processes in the
   thermospheric heating through the photoelectron heating efficiency. (C)

Abstract = {{We employed a real-space formulation of orbital-free density functional
   theory using finite-element basis to study the defect-core and
   energetics of an edge dislocation in Aluminum. Our study shows that the
   core-size of a perfect edge dislocation is around ten times the
   magnitude of the Burgers vector. This finding is contrary to the widely
   accepted notion that continuum descriptions of dislocation energetics
   are accurate beyond similar to 1-3 Burgers vector from the dislocation
   line. Consistent with prior electronic-structure studies, we find that
   the perfect edge dislocation dissociates into two Shockley partials with
   a partial separation distance of 12.8 angstrom. Interestingly, our study
   revealed a significant influence of macroscopic deformations on the
   core-energy of Shockley partials. We show that this dependence of the
   core-energy on macroscopic deformations results in an additional force
   on dislocations, beyond the Peach-Koehler force, that is proportional to
   strain gradients. Further, we demonstrate that this force from
   core-effects can be significant and can play an important role in
   governing the dislocation behavior in regions of inhomogeneous
   deformations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of the molecular structure and physicochemical
   solid-state properties of the solid forms of pharmaceutical compounds is
   a key requirement for successful commercialization as potential active
   ingredients in drug products. These properties can ultimately have a
   critical effect on the solubility and bioavailability of the final drug
   product. Here, the desmotropy of Albendazole forms I and II was
   investigated at the atomic level. Ultrafast magic angle spinning (MAS)
   solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, together with
   powder X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, were performed on polycrystalline samples of the
   two solids in order to fully characterize and distinguish the two forms.
   High-resolution one-dimensional H-1, C-13, and N-15 together with
   two-dimensional H-1/H-1 single quantum-single quantum, H-1/H-1 single
   quantum-double quantum, and H-1/C-13 chemical shift correlation
   solid-state NMR experiments under MAS conditions were extensively used
   to decipher the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding
   interactions present in both solid forms. These experiments enabled the
   unequivocal identification of the tautomers of each desmotrope. Our
   results also revealed that both solid forms may be described as dimeric
   structures, with different intermolecular hydrogen bonds connecting the
   tautomers in each dimer.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal conductivity is an important property for polymers, as it often

   fall within a relatively narrow range (0.1-0.5 Wm(-1) K-1) and are
   largely unexplored. Here, we show that a blend of two polymers with high
   miscibility and appropriately chosen linker structure can yield a dense
   and homogeneously distributed thermal network. A sharp increase in
   cross-plane thermal conductivity is observed under these conditions,
   reaching over 1.5 Wm(-1) K-1 in typical spin-cast polymer blend films of
   nanoscale thickness, which is approximately an order of magnitude larger
   than that of other amorphous polymers.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic model is presented for a novel magnetoelastic rotary
   micro-motor. Magnetoelastic excitation results in a rotary motor with
   comparatively large payload even under direct wireless actuation, but
   the resulting stator behavior is significantly different from that of
   prior micro-scale rotary motors. A parametric modal model is developed
   from conservation of momentum, a second order linear distributed stator
   and ballistic rotor motion. The modes and a pre-stressed finite element
   model are also described to support the parametric modal model. The
   typical simulated model output and parametric analyses are presented
   with important trends and behaviors of the micro-motor motion, including
   stochastic features of rotary and vertical motion, and experimental
   validation. The dynamics of the micro-motor under certain inputs and
   design parameters are also estimated by the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Bone Fracture Toughness and Strength Correlate With Collagen Cross-Link
   Maturity in a Dose-Controlled Lathyrism Mouse Model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Collagen cross-linking is altered in many diseases of bone, and
   enzymatic collagen cross-links are important to bone quality, as
   evidenced by losses of strength after lysyl oxidase inhibition
   (lathyrism). We hypothesized that cross-links also contribute directly
   to bone fracture toughness. A mouse model of lathyrism using
   subcutaneous injection of up to 500 mg/kg beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN)
   was developed and characterized (60 animals across 4 dosage groups).
   Three weeks of 150 or 350 mg/kg BAPN treatment in young, growing mice
   significantly reduced cortical bone fracture toughness, strength, and
   pyridinoline cross-link content. Ratios reflecting relative cross-link
   maturity were positive regressors of fracture toughness (HP/{[}DHLNL +
   HLNL] r(2) = 0.208, p<0.05; {[}HP + LP]/ {[}DHNL + HLNL] r(2) = 0.196,
   p<0.1), whereas quantities of mature pyridinoline cross-links were
   significant positive regressors of tissue strength (lysyl pyridinoline
   r(2) = 0.159, p = 0.014; hydroxylysyl pyridinoline r(2) = 0.112,
   p<0.05). Immature and pyrrole cross-links, which were not significantly
   reduced by BAPN, did not correlate with mechanical properties. The
   effect of BAPN treatment on mechanical properties was dose specific,
   with the greatest impact found at the intermediate (350 mg/kg) dose.
   Calcein labeling was used to define locations of new bone formation,
   allowing for the identification of regions of normally cross-linked
   (preexisting) and BAPN-treated (newly formed, cross-link-deficient)
   bone. Raman spectroscopy revealed spatial differences attributable to
   relative tissue age and effects of cross-link inhibition. Newly
   deposited tissues had lower mineral/matrix, carbonate/phosphate, and
   Amide I cross-link (matrix maturity) ratios compared with preexisting
   tissues. BAPN treatment did not affect mineral measures but
   significantly increased the cross-link (matrix maturity) ratio compared
   with newly formed control tissue. Our study reveals that spatially
   localized effects of short-term BAPN cross-link inhibition can alter the
   whole-bone collagen cross-link profile to a measureable degree, and this
   cross-link profile correlates with bone fracture toughness and strength.
   Thus, cross-link profile perturbations associated with bone disease may
   provide insight into bone mechanical quality and fracture risk. (C) 2014

Title = {{Application of Low-Cost Accelerometers for Measuring the Operational
   Efficiency of a Construction Equipment Fleet}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring the operational efficiency of construction equipment offers
   great opportunities to enhance not only the productivity but also the
   environmental performance of construction operations. However, existing
   enabling technologies still suffer from a lack of economic feasibility,
   as well as technological compatibility with equipment fleets that are
   outdated or that consist of diverse manufacturers' models. In this
   context, this paper examines the feasibility of measuring the
   operational efficiency of equipment using low-cost accelerometers.
   Acceleration data in three axes were collected from a real-world
   operation of excavators that performed various duty cycles. Multiple
   features were calculated from acceleration data, and several classifiers
   using these features were tested to classify equipment operation into
   engine-off, idling, and working modes. An accuracy of over 93\% was
   obtained in the classification of excavators' operation. This result has
   demonstrated that the application of low-cost accelerometers has the
   potential to provide a robust system to automatically measure the
   operational efficiency of construction equipment without any connection
   to its legacy engine system.}},

Title = {{Postdisaster Interdependent Built Environment Recovery Efforts and the
   Effects of Governmental Plans: Case Analysis Using System Dynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Because diverse functional losses of the overall built environment
   (e.g., buildings, industrial facilities, and civil infrastructure) from
   a disaster event cause tremendous inconveniences to refugees, it is
   essential to implement swift recovery plans. However, in a post-disaster
   recovery situation, when resources and time are severely limited, there
   exist difficulties in implementing appropriate plans. These difficulties
   are attributable to a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall
   recovery processes, caused by associated interdependency among the
   functions of a facility/infrastructure and the dynamic features of
   multiple recovery efforts. Thus, this research develops a system
   dynamics (SD) model to understand overall recovery efforts in the whole
   region from a holistic perspective. Based on an actual disaster case
   (the 2011 earthquake of Tohoku), this research conducts a case study to
   analyze the effectiveness of governmental plans. The simulation results
   show that governmental plans primarily aimed at recovering the daily
   lives of populations may not always be helpful for rapid restoration
   operations. The findings also suggest that considering the associated
   interdependency among built environment functions in recovery planning
   is key to supporting not only the rapid functional recovery of the
   facilities but also the improvement of poor restoration work
   environments. In this situation, the timely uses of preplanned and
   government-centered recovery programs (e.g., temporary housing and
   temporary debris movement) can be more effective with a comprehensive
   understanding of dynamic features in interdependent and multiple
   recovery efforts. Further, it is expected that these analytical
   capabilities have the potential to support recovery planners both in
   developing effective special recovery programs and in providing improved
   institutional strategies. Policy implications and lessons learned from a
   past recovery case can also be helpful in providing specific guidelines
   for future disaster recovery planning. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{The use of autografts versus allografts for anterior cruciate ligament
   (ACL) reconstruction is controversial. The current popular options for
   ACL reconstruction are patellar tendon or hamstring autografts, yet
   advances in allograft technologies have made allogeneic grafts a
   favorable option for repair tissue. Despite this, the mismatched
   biomechanical properties and risk of osteoarthritis resulting from the
   current graft technologies have prompted the investigation of new tissue
   sources for ACL reconstruction. Previous work by our lab has
   demonstrated that tissue-engineered bone-ligament-bone (BLB) constructs
   generated from an allogeneic cell source develop structural and
   functional properties similar to those of native ACL and vascular and
   neural structures that exceed those of autologous patellar tendon
   grafts. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of our
   tissue-engineered ligament constructs fabricated from autologous versus
   allogeneic cell sources. Our preliminary results demonstrate that 6
   months postimplantation, our tissue-engineered auto- and allogeneic BLB
   grafts show similar histological and mechanical outcomes indicating that
   the autologous grafts are a viable option for ACL reconstruction. These
   data indicate that our tissue-engineered autologous ligament graft could
   be used in clinical situations where immune rejection and disease
   transmission may preclude allograft use.}},

Title = {{Multi-group SP3 approximation for simulation of a three-dimensional PWR
   rod ejection accident}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{94-100}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Previous researchers have shown that the simplified P-3 (SP3)
   approximation is capable of providing sufficiently high accuracy for
   both static and transient simulations for reactor core analysis with
   considerably less computational expense than higher order transport
   methods such as the discrete ordinate or the full spherical harmonics
   methods. The objective of this paper is to provide a consistent
   comparison of two-group (2G) and multi-group (MG) diffusion and SP3
   transport for rod ejection accident (REA) in a practical light water
   reactor (LWR) problem. The analysis is performed on two numerical
   benchmarks, a 3 x 3 assembly mini-core and a full pressurized water
   reactor (PWR) core. The calculations were performed using pin
   homogenized and assembly homogenized cross sections for a series of
   benchmarks of increasing difficulty, in two-dimensional (2D) and
   three-dimensional (3D), 2G and MG, diffusion and transport, as well as
   with and without feedback. All results show consistency with the
   reference results obtained from higher-order methods. It is demonstrated
   that the analyzed problems show small group-homogenization effects, but
   relatively significant transport effects which are satisfactorily
   addressed by the SP3 transport method. The sensitivity tests also show
   that, for the REA simulation, the MG is more conservative than 2G, P-1
   is more conservative than SP3 for a 1/3 MOX loaded full-core problem.

   direction probabilities with boundary averaging}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{212-222}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The method of characteristic direction probabilities (CDP) combines the
   benefits of the collision probability method (CPM) and the method of
   characteristics (MOC) for the solution of the integral form of the
   Botlzmann Transport Equation. By coupling only the fine regions
   traversed by the characteristic rays in a particular direction, the
   computational effort required to calculate the probability matrices and
   to solve the matrix system is considerably reduced compared to the CPM.
   Furthermore, boundary averaging is performed to reduce the storage and
   computation but the capability of dealing with complicated geometries is
   preserved since the same ray tracing information is used as in MOC. An
   analysis model for the outgoing angular flux is used to analyze a
   variety of outgoing angular flux averaging methods for the boundary and
   to justify the choice of optimize averaging strategy. The boundary
   average CDP method was then implemented in the Michigan PArallel
   Characteristic based Transport (MPACT) code to perform 2-D and 3-D
   transport calculations. The numerical results are given for different
   cases to show the effect of averaging on the outgoing angular flux,
   region scalar flux and the eigenvalue. Comparison of the results with
   the case with no averaging demonstrates that an angular dependent
   averaging strategy is possible for the CDP to improve its computational
   performance without compromising the achievable accuracy. (C) 2014

   System for Fused Magnesium Furnace}},

Abstract = {{In the smelting process of fused magnesium furnaces (FMFs), frequent
   changes in the raw material granule size and impurity constituent will
   cause the arc resistance between the lower end of the electrode and the
   surface of the molten pool to vary, and thus, the smelting currents
   fluctuate. Consequently, abnormal conditions, which can arise if the
   setpoints of electrode currents are not properly adjusted on time, will
   causethe performance to deteriorate or even the overall operation to
   stall. Through analysis of the characteristics of different operating
   conditions, this paper presents a data-driven abnormal condition
   identification and self-healing control system. The proposed system
   extracts the identification rules according to the current tracking
   error, as well as the rate and duration of the current fluctuations, and
   identifies the abnormal conditions based on rule-based reasoning. The
   self-healing control is developed using case-based reasoning to correct
   the current setpoints based on the identification results. The outputs
   of the control loop track the corrected setpoints, thereby forcing the
   process to recover from the abnormal conditions. The proposed method and
   the developed control system have been applied to a real FMF, and
   substantial improvement is achieved with many benefits provided to the
   factory. The implementation results show that occurrence of abnormal
   conditions has been reduced by more than 50\%, and the product quality
   has been increased by more than 2\%.}},

Title = {{Modeling and experimental investigation of gas film in
   micro-electrochemical discharge machining process}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{8-15}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) is a promising machining
   technology that effectively machines non-conducting and brittle
   materials, featuring good material removal rate, flexibility, and
   accuracy of machining. ECDM makes use of the electrochemical discharge
   phenomenon to trigger the discharging by the gas film surrounding the
   tool electrode. As the fundamental of electrochemical discharging, gas
   film is essential to the machining quality and efficiency. However,
   modeling of gas film in electrochemical reaction is not well
   established. This paper presents analytical modeling of the gas film,
   involving bubble growth and departure on electrode, gas film evolution,
   and electrolysis characteristics. Experiments were carried out to
   compare models to the actual discharging phenomenon. High speed camera
   imaging demonstrated the formation of a gas film on the tool electrode.
   The range of thickness of gas film found in experiments indicated good
   consistency with the range of film thickness estimated from analytical
   models. Experiments on critical voltages and currents further revealed
   the characteristics of the gas film in electrochemical reaction. (C)

Title = {{Bubble dynamics in a viscoelastic medium with nonlinear elasticity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{766}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In a variety of recently developed medical procedures, bubbles are
   formed directly in soft tissue and may cause damage. While cavitation in
   Newtonian liquids has received significant attention, bubble dynamics in
   tissue, a viscoelastic medium, remains poorly understood. To model
   tissue, most previous studies have focused on Maxwell-based viscoelastic
   fluids. However, soft tissue generally possesses an original
   configuration to which it relaxes after deformation. Thus, a
   Kelvin-Voigt-based viscoelastic model is expected to be a more
   appropriate representation. Furthermore, large oscillations may occur,
   thus violating the infinitesimal strain assumption and requiring a
   nonlinear/finite-strain elasticity description. In this article, we
   develop a theoretical framework to simulate spherical bubble dynamics in
   a viscoelastic medium with nonlinear elasticity. Following modern
   continuum mechanics formalism, we derive the form of the elastic forces
   acting on a bubble for common strain-energy functions (e.g. neo-Hookean,
   Mooney-Rivlin) and incorporate them into Rayleigh-Plesset-like
   equations. The main effects of nonlinear elasticity are to reduce the
   violence of the collapse and rebound for large departures from the
   equilibrium radius, and increase the oscillation frequency. The present
   approach can readily be extended to other strain-energy functions and
   used to compute the stress/deformation fields in the surrounding medium.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigated the effect of surface recrystallization (RX) on
   the low cycle fatigue (LCF) behaviour of a single crystal (SX)
   superalloy. LCF tests on both raw and recrystallized samples showed that
   fatigue life was significantly reduced by surface RX. Fractography
   indicated that fatigue cracks initiated from the casting defects in RX
   layer and multiple crack initiations were commonly observed. Moreover,
   RX grains exhibited predominantly transgranular cracking, in contrast to
   the intergranular fracture reported in literature. The fatigue crack
   propagation behaviour was discussed in light of fracture mechanics and
   crack growth life model. The fatigue cycles required to penetrate RX
   layer were estimated to be about one magnitude lower than that in
   forming an equivalent crack in SX specimens. It is suggested that the
   earlier crack initiation and promoted crack propagation in RX layer, as
   well as the trend of multiple initiations, are responsible for the
   fatigue degradation by RX.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a new framework for robust MUltiple SIgnal
   Classification (MUSIC). The proposed framework, called robust
   measure-transformed (MT) MUSIC, is based on applying a transform to the
   probability distribution of the received signals, i.e., transformation
   of the probability measure defined on the observation space. In robust
   MT-MUSIC, the sample covariance is replaced by the empirical
   MT-covariance. By judicious choice of the transform, we show that 1) the
   resulting empirical MT-covariance is B-robust, with bounded influence
   function that takes negligible values for large norm outliers, and 2)
   under the assumption of spherically contoured noise distribution, the
   noise subspace can be determined from the eigendecomposition of the
   MT-covariance. Furthermore, we derive a new robust measure-transformed
   minimum description length (MDL) criterion for estimating the number of
   signals, and extend the MT-MUSIC framework to the case of coherent
   signals. The proposed approach is illustrated in simulation examples
   that show its advantages as compared to other robust MUSIC and MDL
   generalizations.}},

Abstract = {{While toughening and damage might seem to be two contradictory concepts
   for the mechanics of crack growth, they are actually the same phenomena
   perceived from two different vantage points. Similarly, the concepts of
   extrinsic and intrinsic toughening, defined in terms of whether a
   toughening mechanism occurs behind or ahead of a crack, depend on the
   definition of a crack tip that, in the absence of a singularity, can be
   somewhat arbitrary. Cohesive-zone models provide useful numerical tools
   for rationalizing these different concepts and, here, we use them to
   show how different perspectives of toughening and damage can be
   understood.
   The concept of a cohesive length, defined in terms of an effective
   modulus and the magnitudes of the local tractions and displacements (or
   work done), can be generalized so that it can be used at any load before
   failure, and at any point along the interface. We show that this general
   concept allows multiple damage and toughening mechanisms, each with its
   own characteristic cohesive length, to be described and tracked in terms
   of a single traction separation law. In general, the onset of damage
   corresponds to an increase in cohesive length. This tends to weaken a
   material unless compensated for by a sufficiently high increment of
   additional toughness. The ratio between the cohesive length of a
   particular damage/toughening mechanism and any relevant geometrical
   length determines whether the mechanism needs to be included in the
   cohesive-zone formulation. Furthermore, it appears that diffuse damage
   and crack jumping between interfaces may be induced when the cohesive
   length of a damage mechanism is large compared to a micro-structural
   length. It is speculated that this may be of some relevance to the
   design of hierarchical materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Chemical, mechanical, and topographic extracellular matrix (ECM) cues
   have been extensively studied for their influence on cell behavior.
   These ECM cues alter cell adhesion, cell shape, and cell migration and
   activate signal transduction pathways to influence gene expression,
   proliferation, and differentiation. ECM elasticity and topography, in
   particular, have emerged as material properties of intense focus based
   on strong evidence these physical cues can partially dictate stem cell
   differentiation. Cells generate forces to pull on their adhesive
   contacts, and these tractional forces appear to be a common element of
   cells' responses to both elasticity and topography. This review focuses
   on recently published work that links ECM topography and mechanics and
   their influence on differentiation and other cell behaviors. We also
   highlight signaling pathways typically implicated in mechanotransduction
   that are (or may be) shared by cells subjected to topographic cues.
   Finally, we conclude with a brief discussion of the potential
   implications of these commonalities for cell based therapies and
   biomaterial design. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res

Abstract = {{Characterizing irradiation damage in materials utilized in light water
   reactors is critical for both material development and application
   reliability. Here we use both nanoindentation and Laue microdiffraction
   to characterize both the mechanical response and microstructure
   evolution due to irradiation. Two different irradiation conditions were
   considered in 304 stainless steel: 1 dpa and 10 dpa. In addition, an
   annealed condition of the 10 dpa specimen for 1 h at 500 degrees C was
   evaluated. Nanoindentation revealed an increase in hardness due to
   irradiation and also revealed that hardness saturated in the 10 dpa
   case. Broadening using Laue microdiffraction peaks indicates a
   significant plastic deformation in the irradiated area that is in good
   agreement with both the SRIM calculations and the nanoindentation
   results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Thermodynamic mixing properties of the UO2-HfO2 solid solution: Density

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{458}},
Pages = {{296-303}},

Abstract = {{HfO2 is a neutron absorber and has been mechanically mixed with UO2 in
   nuclear fuel in order to control the core power distribution. During
   nuclear fission, the temperature at the center of the fuel pellet can
   reach above 1300 K, where hafnium may substitute uranium and form the
   binary solid solution of UO2-HfO2. UO2 adopts the cubic fluorite
   structure, but HfO2 can occur in monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic
   structures. The distribution of Hf and U ions in the UO2-HfO2 binary and
   its atomic structure influence the thermal conductivity and melting
   point of the fuel. However, experimental data on the UO2-HfO2 binary are
   limited. Therefore, the enthalpies of mixing of the UO2-HfO2 binary with
   three different structures were calculated in this study using density
   functional theory and subsequent Monte Carlo simulations. The free
   energy of mixing was obtained from thermodynamic integration of the
   enthalpy of mixing over temperature. From the DG of mixing, a phase
   diagram of the binary was obtained. The calculated UO2-HfO2 binary forms
   extensive solid solution across the entire compositional range, but
   there are a variety of possible exsolution phenomena associated with the
   different HfO2 polymorphs. As the structure of the HfO2 end member
   adopts lower symmetry and becomes less similar to cubic UO2, the
   miscibility gap of the phase diagram expands, accompanied by an increase
   in cell volume by 7-10\% as the structure transforms from cubic to
   monoclinic. Close to the UO2 end member, which is relevant to the
   nuclear fuel, the isometric uranium-rich solid solutions exsolve as the
   fuel cools, and there is a tendency to form the monoclinic hafnium-rich
   phase in the matrix of the isometric, uranium-rich solid solution phase.

Volume = {{277}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical instability of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SE!)
   layer in lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries causes significant side
   reactions resulting in Li-ion consumption and cell impedance rise by
   forming further SEI layers, which eventually leads to battery capacity
   fade and power fade. In this paper, the composition-/structure-dependent
   elasticity of the SEI layer is investigated via Atomic Force Microscopy
   (AFM) measurements coupled with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
   analysis, and atomistic calculations. It is observed that the inner
   layer is stiffer than the outer layer. The measured Young's moduli are
   mostly in the range of 0.2-4.5 GPa, while some values above 80 GPa are
   also observed. This wide variation of the observed elastic modulus is
   elucidated by atomistic calculations with a focus on chemical and
   structural analysis. The numerical analysis shows the Young's moduli
   range from 2.4 GPa to 58.1 GPa in the order of the polymeric, organic,
   and amorphous inorganic components. The crystalline inorganic component
   (LiF) shows the highest value (135.3 GPa) among the SEI species. This
   quantitative observation on the elasticity of individual components of
   the SEI layer must be essential to analyzing the mechanical behavior of
   the SEI layer and to optimizing and controlling it. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Modern technology demands ever smaller and more efficient nanoparticles,
   wires and networks. The natural tendency for amyloid proteins to form
   fibrillar structures is leveraged in creating high aspect ratio,
   nano-sized protein fibers as scaffolds for metallized nanowires. The
   morphology of fibrils is influenced by induced strain during denaturing
   and early aggregation and subsequent fibril deposition with platinum
   leads to controlled catalyst surfaces based on the initial protein
   precipitate. Here we have created insulin fibrils with varying
   morphologies produced in the presence of heat and strain and
   investigated their metallization with platinum by TEM. The catalytic
   activity of the metal-coated protein fibrils was resolved by tracking
   the reaction kinetics of the conversion of 4-nitrophenol to
   4-aminophenol in the presence of the produced nanowires using UV-Vis
   spectroscopy. The effects of fibril morphology and temperature on the
   pseudo-first-order kinetics of conversion are investigated. Conversion
   to 4-aminophenol occurs on the order of minutes and is independent of
   temperature in the range tested (7 to 20 degrees C). Two regimes of
   conversion are identified, an early higher rate, followed by a slower
   later rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{This retrospective study of protein aggregation measured by Thioflavin T
   (ThT) fluorescence assay in published literature has assessed protein
   sensitivity to denaturing conditions that include elevated temperatures,
   fluctuations in pH, and concentration and, in particular, agitation to
   induce amyloid structure formation. The dynamic tracking of fluorescence
   shows a sigmoidal evolution as aggregates form; the resulting kinetics
   of association have been analyzed to explore the range of aggregation
   behavior which occurs based on environmental parameters. Comparisons
   between the experimental results of different groups have been
   historically difficult due to subtleties of experimental procedures
   including denaturing temperature, protein type and concentration,
   formulation differences, and how agitation is achieved. While it is
   clear that agitation has a strong influence on the driving force for
   aggregation, the use of magnetic stirring bar or shaker table rotational
   speed is insufficient to characterize the degree of turbulence produced
   during shear. The pathway forward in resolving dependence of aggregate
   formation on shear may require alternative methodologies or better
   standardization of the experimental protocols. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Conventional oral therapies for the treatment of tuberculosis are
   limited by poor antibiotic distribution in granulomas, which contributes
   to lengthy treatment regimens and inadequate bacterial sterilization.
   Inhaled formulations are a promising strategy to increase antibiotic
   efficacy and reduce dose frequency. We develop a multiscale
   computational approach that accounts for simultaneous dynamics of a lung
   granuloma, carrier release kinetics, pharmacokinetics, and
   pharmacodynamics. Using this computational platform, we predict that a
   rationally designed inhaled formulation of isoniazid given at a
   significantly reduced dose frequency has better sterilizing capabilities
   and reduced toxicity than the current oral regimen. Furthermore, we
   predict that inhaled formulations of rifampicin require unrealistic
   carrier antibiotic loadings that lead to early toxicity concerns.
   Lastly, we predict that targeting carriers to macrophages has limited
   effects on treatment efficacy. Our platform can be extended to account
   for additional antibiotics and provides a new tool for rapidly
   prototyping the efficacy of inhaled formulations.}},

Abstract = {{Tomographic image reconstruction is often formulated as a regularized
   weighted least squares (RWLS) problem optimized by iterative algorithms
   that are either inherently algebraic or derived from a statistical point
   of view. This paper compares a modified version of simultaneous
   iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT), which is of the former type,
   with a version of separable quadratic surrogates (SQS), which is of the
   latter type. We show that the two algorithms minimize the same criterion
   function using similar forms of preconditioned gradient descent. We
   present near-optimal relaxation for both based on eigenvalue bounds and
   include a heuristic extension for use with ordered subsets. We provide
   empirical evidence that SIRT and SQS converge at the same rate for all
   intents and purposes. For context, we compare their performance with an
   implementation of preconditioned conjugate gradient. The illustrative
   application is X-ray CT of luggage for aviation security.}},

   Plasticity and Its Characterization of Tool Feature Size Effects}},

Abstract = {{Conventional material models cannot describe material behaviors
   precisely in micro/ mesoscale due to the size/scale effects. In
   micro/mesoscale forming process, the reaction force, localized stress
   concentration, and formability are not only dependent on the strain
   distribution and strain path but also on the strain gradient and strain
   gradient path caused by decreased scale. This study presented an
   analytical model based on the conventional mechanism of strain gradient
   (CMSG) plasticity. Finite element (FE) simulations were performed to
   study the effects of the width of microchannel features. Die sets were
   fabricated and micro/mesoscale sheet forming experiments were conducted.
   The results indicated that the CMSG plastic theory achieves better
   agreements compared to the conventional plastic theory. It was also
   found that the influence of strain gradient on the forming process
   increases with the decrease of the geometrical parameters of tools.
   Furthermore, the feature size effects in the forming process were
   evaluated and quantitated by the similarity difference and the
   similarity accuracy. Various tool geometrical parameters were designed
   based on the Taguchi method to explore the influence of the strain
   gradient caused by the decrease of tool dimension. According to the
   scale law, the difference and accuracy of similarity were calculated.
   Greater equivalent strain gradient was revealed with the decrease of
   tool dimension, which led to the greater maximum reaction force error
   due to the increasing size effects. The main effect plots for equivalent
   strain gradient and reaction force indicated that the influence of tools
   clearance is greater than those of punch radius, die radius, and die
   width.}},

Title = {{Anisotropic thermal transport in MOF-5 composites}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{250-258}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new class of porous, crystalline
   materials with applications in the capture, storage, and separation of
   gasses. Although much effort has been devoted to understanding the
   properties of MOFs in powder form, in a realistic system the MOF media
   will likely be employed as dense compacts, such as pucks or pellets, to
   maximize volumetric efficiency. In these applications efficient
   transport of the heat of adsorption/desorption is an important design
   consideration. Consequently, densified composites consisting of a
   physical mixture of a MOF and expanded natural graphite (ENG) have been
   proposed as a means to enhance the intrinsically low thermal
   conductivity of these materials. Here we demonstrate that the
   high-aspect ratio of ENG particles, combined with uni-axial compression,
   results in anisotropic microstructural and thermal transport properties
   in composite MOF-5/ENG pellets. Microscopy of pellet cross-sections
   revealed a textured microstructure with MOF particle boundaries and ENG
   orientations aligned perpendicular to the pressing. direction. This
   anisotropy is manifested in the thermal conductivity, which is two to
   four times higher in directions perpendicular to the pressing direction.
   We further demonstrate that this anisotropy can be exploited using two
   processing techniques. First, a custom die and densification process
   allows for reorientation of the preferred heat flow pathway. Second, a
   layered MOF-5/ENG microstructure increases the thermal conductivity by
   an order of magnitude, with only minor ENG additions (5 wt.\%). These
   results reveal that anisotropic thermal transport in MOF composites can
   be tailored using a judicious combination of second phase additions and
   processing techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{The use of a shroud is known to improve performance. In this work, the
   flow physics and performance of shrouded turbines is assessed by solving
   the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations supplemented with a
   transition model. Shroud geometries are evaluated for their augmentation
   of mass flow through the turbine. Initial assessments are performed
   using axisymmetric calculations of annular wings with high-lift airfoils
   as cross sections. The mass flow amplification factor is defined as a
   performance parameter and is found to increase nearly linearly with
   radial lift force. From a selection of considered airfoils, the Selig
   S1223 high-lift airfoil is found to best promote mass flow rate. Full
   three-dimensional simulations of shrouded wind turbines are performed
   for selected shroud geometries. The results are compared to open turbine
   solutions. Augmentation ratios of up to 1.9 are achieved. Peak
   augmentation occurs at the highest wind speed for which the flow over
   the blade stays attached. Flowfields are examined in detail and the
   following aspects are investigated: regions with flow separation, the
   development of velocity profiles, and the interaction between the
   turbine wake and shroud boundary layer. The sensitivity of the solutions
   to rotation rate is examined. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Nonlinear equations of motion that describe the electromechanical system

Title = {{Size effects in the thermal conductivity of gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3)
   films grown via open-atmosphere annealing of gallium nitride}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},

Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Gallium nitride (GaN) is a widely used semiconductor for high frequency
   and high power devices due to of its unique electrical properties: a
   wide band gap, high breakdown field, and high electron mobility.
   However, thermal management has become a limiting factor regarding
   efficiency, lifetime, and advancement of GaN devices and GaN-based
   applications. In this work, we study the thermal conductivity of
   beta-phase gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3) thin films, a component of typical
   gate oxides used in such devices. We use time domain thermoreflectance
   to measure the thermal conductivity of a variety of polycrystalline
   beta-Ga2O3 films of different thicknesses grown via open atmosphere
   annealing of the surfaces of GaN films on sapphire substrates. We show
   that the measured effective thermal conductivity of these beta-Ga2O3
   films can span 1.5 orders of magnitude, increasing with an increased
   film thickness, which is indicative of the relatively large intrinsic
   thermal conductivity of the beta-Ga2O3 grown via this technique (8.8 +/-
   3.4W m(-1) K-1) and large mean free paths compared to typical gate
   dielectrics commonly used in GaN device contacts. By conducting time
   domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) measurements with different metal
   transducers (Al, Au, and Au with a Ti wetting layer), we attribute this
   variation in effective thermal conductivity to a combination of size
   effects in the beta-Ga2O3 film resulting from phonon scattering at the
   beta-Ga2O3/GaN interface and thermal transport across the beta-Ga2O3/GaN
   interface. The measured thermal properties of open atmosphere-grown
   beta-Ga2O3 and its interface with GaN set the stage for thermal
   engineering of gate contacts in high frequency GaN-based devices. (C)

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies various mechanisms to enhance the coherent
   Smith-Purcell radiation (SPR) at terahertz frequencies using
   particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. A simple analytical dispersion
   relation is derived to predict the frequency of the evanescent surface
   wave of the open grating, which is excited by a backward-wave
   oscillation mechanism and emits radiation at harmonics of this
   frequency, and the cavity mode frequencies of the Orotron-like device,
   all in excellent agreement with the simulation data. The grating
   parameters are optimized to minimize the starting current of a
   continuous electron beam for exciting coherent SPR. It is demonstrated
   that a prebunched beam can be used to selectively excite coherent SPR at
   desired SPR angle and frequencies that are higher harmonics of the beam
   bunching frequency, where the starting current requirement is
   eliminated. Our PIC simulations show the dynamics of modes development
   and competition for the Orotron-like open cavity structure, which owns a
   lower starting current than the surface mode process. This oscillation
   mode dominates at steady state and enhances the radiated power by more
   than 2 orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The catalytic performance of Au/CeO2-Fe2O3 prepared by

   investigated. It was found that the 3 wt\% Au/CeO2-Fe2O3 with Ce/(Ce +
   Fe) = 0.25 calcined at 300 degrees C exhibited the highest methanol
   conversion and H-2 concentration in the temperature range of 200-400
   degrees C. The H-2-TPR, XPS, and XRD studies suggested improvements in
   metal-metal, metal-support, and support-support interactions. The
   co-existence of free alpha-Fe2O3 and the Ce1-xFexO2 solid solution
   phases seemed to be necessary for high activity. Additionally, the
   Au/CeO2Fe2O3 displayed a long life-time, even in the presence of coke
   deposition and transformation of the solid solution phase. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Precise control over the geometry and chemistry of multiphasic particles
   is of significant importance for a wide range of applications. In this
   work, we have developed one of the simplest methodologies for
   fabricating monodisperse, multiphasic micro- and nanoparticles
   possessing almost any composition, projected shape, modulus, and
   dimensions as small as 25 nm. The synthesis methodology involves the
   fabrication of a nonwettable surface patterned with monodisperse,
   wettable domains of different sizes and shapes. When such patterned
   templates are dip-coated with polymer solutions or particle dispersions,
   the liquids, and consequently the polymer or the particles,
   preferentially self-assemble within the wettable domains. Utilizing this
   phenomenon, we fabricate multiphasic assemblies with precisely
   controlled geometry and composition through multiple, layered
   depositions of polymers and/or particles within the patterned domains.
   Upon releasing these multiphasic assemblies from the template using a
   sacrificial layer, we obtain multiphasic particles. The templates can
   then be readily reused (over 20 times in our experiments) for
   fabricating a new batch of particles, enabling a rapid, inexpensive, and
   easily reproducible method for large-scale manufacturing of multiphasic
   particles.}},

Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{2211-2217}},

Abstract = {{A strategy that allows the tuning of pore size in microporous
   coordination polymers (MCPs) through modification of their organic
   linkers is presented. When large substituents are introduced onto the
   linker, these pendent groups partially occupy the pores, thus reducing
   pore size while serving as additional adsorption sites for gases. The
   approach takes advantage of the fact that, for methane storage
   materials, small pores (0.4-0.8 nm in diameter) are more desirable than
   large pores since small pores promote optimal volumetric capacity. This
   method was demonstrated with IRMOF-8, a MCP constructed from Zn4O metal
   clusters and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (NDC) linkers. The NDC was
   functionalized through the addition of substituents including
   tert-butylethynyl or phenylethynyl groups. High pressure methane uptake
   demonstrates that the IRMOF-8 derivatives have significantly better
   performance than the unfunctionalized material in terms of both excess
   volumetric uptake and deliverable capacity. Moreover, IRMOF-8
   derivatives also give rise to stronger interactions with methane
   molecules as shown by higher heat of adsorption values.}},

Title = {{Harnessing intrinsic localized modes to identify impurities in nonlinear
   periodic systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) are concentrations of vibrational
   energy in periodic systems/lattices due to the combined influences of
   nonlinearity and discreteness. Moreover, ILMs can move within the system
   and may strongly interact with an impurity, such as a stiffness change,
   mass variation, etc. Numerous scientific fields have uncovered examples
   and evidence of ILMs, motivating a multidisciplinary pursuit to
   rigorously understand the underlying principles. In spite of the diverse
   technical studies, a characterization of ILM interaction behaviors with
   multiple impurities in dissipative lattices remains outstanding. The
   insights on such behaviors may be broadly useful when dynamic
   measurements are the only accessible features of the periodic system.
   For instance, one may guide an ILM within the lattice using a
   deliberately applied and steered impurity and harness the observed
   interaction behaviors with a second, static (immovable) impurity/defect
   to identify how the underlying lattice is different at the second,
   defected site, whether or not one knew the position of the defect a
   priori. In this spirit, this research studies, analyzes, and
   characterizes the interaction types amongst an ILM and multiple
   impurities, and devises a method to identify a static defect impurity
   using quantitatively and qualitatively distinct interaction phenomena.
   The method is found to be robust to moderate levels of lattice stiffness
   heterogeneity and is applicable to monitor various property changes that
   represent impurities. Finally, experimental studies verify that ILMs
   interact with multiple impurities in unique ways such that defect
   features may be effectively identified. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{While active tuberculosis (TB) is a treatable disease, many complex
   factors prevent its global elimination. Part of the difficulty in
   developing optimal therapies is the large design space of antibiotic
   doses, regimens and combinations. Computational models that capture the
   spatial and temporal dynamics of antibiotics at the site of infection
   can aid in reducing the design space of costly and time-consuming animal
   pre-clinical and human clinical trials. The site of infection in TB is
   the granuloma, a collection of immune cells and bacteria that form in
   the lung, and new data suggest that penetration of drugs throughout
   granulomas is problematic. Here we integrate our computational model of
   granuloma formation and function with models for plasma
   pharmacokinetics, lung tissue pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for
   two first line anti-TB antibiotics. The integrated model is calibrated
   to animal data. We make four predictions. First, antibiotics are
   frequently below effective concentrations inside granulomas, leading to
   bacterial growth between doses and contributing to the long treatment
   periods required for TB. Second, antibiotic concentration gradients form
   within granulomas, with lower concentrations toward their centers.
   Third, during antibiotic treatment, bacterial subpopulations are similar
   for INH and RIF treatment: mostly intracellular with extracellular
   bacteria located in areas nonpermissive for replication (hypoxic areas),
   presenting a slowly increasing target population over time. Finally, we
   find that on an individual granuloma basis, pre-treatment infection
   severity (including bacterial burden, host cell activation and host cell
   death) is predictive of treatment outcome. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Changes in temperature were found to affect the morphology, cell
   viability, and mechanical properties of Staphylococcus epidermidis
   bacterial biofilms. S. epidermidis biofilms are commonly associated with
   hospital-acquired medical device infections. We observed the effect of
   heat treatment on three physical properties of the biofilms: the
   bacterial cell morphology and viability, the polymeric properties of the
   extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and the rheological properties
   of the bulk biofilm. After application of a 1 h heat treatment at 45
   degrees C, cell reproduction had ceased, and at 60 degrees C, cell
   viability was significantly reduced. Size exclusion chromatography was
   used to fractionate the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) based on
   size. Chemical analysis of each fraction showed that the relative
   concentrations of the polysaccharide, protein, and DNA components of the
   EPS were unchanged by the heat treatment at 45 and 60 degrees C. The
   results suggest that the EPS molecular constituents are not
   significantly degraded by the temperature treatment. However, some
   aggregation on the scale of 100 nm was found by dynamic light scattering
   at 60 degrees C. Finally, relative to control biofilms maintained at 37
   degrees C, we observed an order of magnitude reduction in the biofilm
   yield stress after 60 degrees C temperature treatment. No such
   difference was found for treatment at 45 degrees C. From these results,
   we conclude that the yield stress of bacterial biofilms is
   temperature-sensitive and that this sensitivity is correlated with cell
   viability. The observed significant decrease in yield stress with
   temperature suggests a means to weaken the mechanical integrity of S.
   epidermidis biofilms with applications in areas such as the treatment of
   biofilm-infected medical devices.}},

Abstract = {{The small signal modulation characteristics of an InGaN/GaN nanowire
   array edge-emitting laser on (001) silicon are reported. The emission
   wavelength is 610 nm. Lattice matched InAlN cladding layers were
   incorporated in the laser heterostructure for better mode confinement.
   The suitability of the nanowire lasers for use in plastic fiber
   communication systems with direct modulation is demonstrated through
   their modulation bandwidth of f(-3dB,max) = 3.1 GHz, very low values of
   chirp (0.8 angstrom) and alpha-parameter, and large differential gain
   (3.1 x 10(-17) cm(2)). (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We used density functional and many-body perturbation theory to
   calculate the quasiparticle band structures and electronic transport
   parameters of p-type SnSe both for the low-temperature Pnma and
   high-temperature Cmcm phases. The Pnma phase has an indirect band gap of
   0.829 eV, while the Cmcm has a direct band gap of 0.464 eV. Both phases
   exhibit multiple local band extrema within an energy range comparable to
   the thermal energy of carriers from the global extrema. We calculated
   the electronic transport coefficients as a function of doping
   concentration and temperature for single-crystal and polycrystalline
   materials to understand the previous experimental measurements. The
   electronic transport coefficients are highly anisotropic and are
   strongly affected by bipolar transport effects at high temperature. Our
   results indicate that SnSe exhibits optimal thermoelectric performance
   at high temperature when doped in the 10(19)-10(20) cm(-3) range. (C)

Abstract = {{An optical ozone sensor was developed based on the finding that a purely
   organic phosphor linearly loses its phosphorescence emission intensity
   in the presence of varying concentration of ozone gas and ozonated
   water. Compared to conventional conductance-based inorganic sensors, our
   novel sensory film has many advantages such as easy fabrication,
   low-cost, and portability. NMR data confirmed that phosphorescence drop
   is attributed to oxidation of the core triplet generating aldehyde group
   of the phosphor. We observed that linear correlation between
   phosphorescence and ozone concentration and it can detect ozone
   concentrations of 0.1 ppm that is the threshold concentration harmful to
   human tissue and respiratory organs. Like a litmus paper, this ozone
   sensor can be fabricated as a free-standing and disposable film.}},

Title = {{How Dopants Can Enhance Charge Transport in Li2O2}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{839-847}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{The performance of high-capacity Li/O-2 batteries is limited by the high
   overpotential associated with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during
   charging. These losses have been attributed to sluggish charge transport
   within the solid lithium peroxide (Li2O2) discharge phase. Recent
   experiments have shown that use of Co3O4-containing Li/O-2 electrodes
   enhances rechargeability, but the mechanism responsible for this effect
   is unclear, as are the general prospects for the promotion of the Li/O-2
   OER. Here first-principles calculations are combined with
   continuum-scale transport theory to build a multiscale model which
   demonstrates that the incorporation of trace Co into Li2O2 is a
   plausible mechanism for OER promotion. These calculations suggest that
   doping at equilibrium levels (tens of ppm) can enhance charge transport
   by shifting the balance of Li-ion vacancies and hole polarons. This
   mechanism could rationalize the improved rechargeability observed in
   Li/O-2 electrodes containing Co. On the basis of a computational
   assessment of 22 additional dopants, we speculate that Ni may also be an
   effective OER promoter.}},

Abstract = {{It is well-known that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be grown directly on
   the surface of stainless steel (SS) alloys, because the native
   composition of SS contains elements that seed CNT growth upon
   hydrocarbon exposure at elevated temperature. Often such methods use
   acid immersion or oxidation in air to treat the surface prior to
   hydrocarbon exposure for CNT growth. However, there lacks a general
   understanding of how the surface chemistry and morphology influences the
   nucleation and growth of CNTs. Using environmental transmission electron
   microscopy, we observe that CNT growth is enabled by surface
   reconstruction of SS upon oxygen exposure at elevated temperature,
   followed by further breakup of the surface upon reduction, and
   subsequent CNT nucleation and growth upon hydrocarbon exposure. Using
   electron energy loss spectroscopy, we find that catalyst particles
   consist of both pure iron as well as iron alloys such as FeCr and FeNi.
   We use these insights to study the synthesis of CNTs on bulk net-shaped
   porous SS materials and show that annealing of the SS at 1000 degrees C
   in air prior to CVD using an ethylene feedstock mixture produces a
   70-fold increase in CNT yield. Our findings demonstrate how process
   conditions can be designed for efficient manufacturing of CNT-enhanced
   stainless steel materials, and guide improved understanding of CNT
   growth on other industrially relevant metal substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Capacity and voltage fading of Li2MnO3 is a major challenge for the
   application of this category of material, which is believed to be
   associated with the structural and chemical evolution of the materials.
   This paper reports the detailed structural and chemical evolutions of
   Li2MnO3 cathode captured by using aberration corrected
   scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) after certain numbers
   of chargedischarge cycling of the batteries. It is found that structural
   degradation occurs from the very first cycle and is spatially initiated
   from the surface of the particle and propagates toward the inner bulk as
   the cyclic number increases, featuring the formation of the surface
   phase transformation layer and gradual thickening of this layer. The
   structure degradation is found to follow a sequential phase
   transformation: monoclinic C-2/m -> tetragonal I41 -> cubic spinel,
   which is consistently supported by the decreasing lattice formation
   energy based on DFT calculations. For the first time, high spatial
   resolution quantitative chemical analysis reveals that 20\% oxygen in
   the surface phase transformation layer is removed and such a newly
   developed surface layer is a Li-depleted layer with reduced Mn cations.
   This work demonstrates a direct correlation between structural
   degradation and the cells electrochemical degradation, which enhances
   our understanding of LiMn-rich (LMR) cathode materials.}},

Abstract = {{Many powerful drugs have limited clinical utility because of poor water
   solubility and high systemic toxicity. Here, we formulated a targeted
   nanomedicine, rapamycin encapsulated in pegylated octadecyl lithocholate
   micelles labeled with a new ligand for colorectal neoplasia, LTTHYKL
   peptide. CPC; Apc mice that spontaneously develop colonic adenomas were
   treated with free rapamycin, plain rapamycin micelles, and
   peptide-labeled rapamycin micelles via intraperitoneal injection for 35
   days. Endoscopy was performed to monitor adenoma regression in vivo. We
   observed complete adenoma regression at the end of therapy. The mean
   regression rate for peptide-labeled rapamycin micelles was significantly
   greater than that for plain rapamycin micelles, P < 0.01. On
   immunohistochemistry, we observed a significant reduction in phospho-S6
   but not beta-catenin expression and reduced tumor cell proliferation,
   suggesting greater inhibition of downstreammTOR signaling. We observed
   significantly reduced renal toxicity for peptide-labeled rapamycin
   micelles compared to that of free drug, and no other toxicities were
   found on chemistries. Together, this unique targeted micelle represents
   a potential therapeutic for colorectal neoplasia with comparable
   therapeutic efficacy to rapamycin free drug and significantly less
   systemic toxicity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Sequential defense against random and intentional attacks in complex
   networks}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Network robustness against attacks is one of the most fundamental
   researches in network science as it is closely associated with the
   reliability and functionality of various networking paradigms. However,
   despite the study on intrinsic topological vulnerabilities to node
   removals, little is known on the network robustness when network defense
   mechanisms are implemented, especially for networked engineering systems
   equipped with detection capabilities. In this paper, a sequential
   defense mechanism is first proposed in complex networks for attack
   inference and vulnerability assessment, where the data fusion center
   sequentially infers the presence of an attack based on the binary attack
   status reported from the nodes in the network. The network robustness is
   evaluated in terms of the ability to identify the attack prior to
   network disruption under two major attack schemes, i.e., random and
   intentional attacks. We provide a parametric plug-in model for
   performance evaluation on the proposed mechanism and validate its
   effectiveness and reliability via canonical complex network models and
   real-world large-scale network topology. The results show that the
   sequential defense mechanism greatly improves the network robustness and
   mitigates the possibility of network disruption by acquiring limited
   attack status information from a small subset of nodes in the network.}},

Abstract = {{Photoinduced charge-transfer (CT) processes play a key role in many
   systems, particularly those relevant to organic photovoltaics and
   photosynthesis. Advancing the understanding of CT processes calls for
   comparing their rates measured via state-of-the-art time-resolved
   interface-specific spectroscopic techniques with theoretical predictions
   based on first-principles molecular models. We measure charge-transfer
   rates across a boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc)/C-60
   heterojunction, commonly used in organic photovoltaics, via
   heterodyne-detected time-resolved second-harmonic generation. We compare
   these results to theoretical predictions based on a Fermis golden rule
   approach, with input parameters obtained using first-principles
   calculations for two different equilibrium geometries of a molecular
   donoracceptor in a dielectric continuum model. The calculated rates
   (similar to 2 ps(-1)) overestimate the measured rates (similar to 0.1
   ps(-1)), which is consistent with the expectation that the calculated
   rates represent an upper bound over the experimental ones. The
   comparison provides valuable understanding of how the structure of the
   electron donor-acceptor interface affects the CT kinetics in organic
   photovoltaic systems.}},

Title = {{Age affects the contraction-induced mitochondrial redox response in
   skeletal muscle}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 4}},
Abstract = {{Compromised mitochondrial respiratory function is associated with
   advancing age. Damage due to an increase in reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) with age is thought to contribute to the mitochondrial deficits.
   The coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in its reduced (NADH) and
   oxidized (NAD(+)) forms plays an essential role in the cyclic sequence
   of reactions that result in the regeneration of ATP by oxidative
   phosphorylation in mitochondria. Monitoring mitochondrial NADH/NAD(+)
   redox status during recovery from an episode of high energy demand thus
   allows assessment of mitochondrial function. NADH fluoresces when
   excited with ultraviolet light in the UV-A band and NAD(+) does not,
   allowing NADH/NAD(+) to be monitored in real time using fluorescence
   microscopy. Our goal was to assess mitochondrial function by monitoring
   the NADH fluorescence response following a brief period of high energy
   demand in muscle from adult and old wild-type mice. This was
   accomplished by isolating whole lumbrical muscles from the hind paws of
   7- and 28-month-old mice and making simultaneous measurements of force
   and NADH fluorescence responses during and after a 5s maximum isometric
   contraction. All muscles exhibited fluorescence oscillations that were
   qualitatively similar and consisted of a brief transient increase
   followed by a longer transient period of reduced fluorescence and,
   finally, an increase that included an overshoot before recovering to
   resting level. Compared with the adult mice, muscles from the 28 mo mice
   exhibited a delayed peak during the first fluorescence transient and an
   attenuated recovery following the second transient. These findings
   indicate an impaired mitochondrial capacity to maintain NADH/NAD(+)
   redox homeostasis during contractile activity in skeletal muscles of old
   mice.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been proposed as a new algorithm for
   training single hidden layer feed forward neural networks. The main
   merit of ELM lies in the fact that the input weights as well as hidden
   layer bias are randomly generated and thus the output weights can be
   obtained analytically, which can overcome the drawbacks incurred by
   gradient-based training algorithms such as local optima, improper
   learning rate and low learning speed. Based on the consistency property
   of data, which enforces similar samples to share similar properties, we
   propose a discriminative graph regularized Extreme Learning Machine
   (GELM) for further enhancing its classification performance in this
   paper. In the proposed GELM model, the label information of training
   samples are used to construct an adjacent graph and correspondingly the
   graph regularization term is formulated to constrain the output weights
   to learn similar outputs for samples from the same class. The proposed
   GELM model also has a closed form solution as the standard ELM and thus
   the output weights can be obtained efficiently. Experiments on several
   widely used face databases show that our proposed GELM can achieve much
   performance gain over standard ELM and regularized ELM. Moreover, GELM
   also performs well when compared with the state-of-the-art
   classification methods for face recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The development and characterization of a microanalytical subsystem
   comprising silicon-micromachined first- and second-dimension separation
   columns and a silicon-micromachined thermal modulator (mu TM) for
   comprehensive two-dimensional (i.e., mu GC x mu GC) separations are
   described. The first dimension consists of two series-coupled 3.1 cm x
   3.1 cm mu column chips with etched channels 3 m long and 250 mu m x 140
   mu m in cross section, wall-coated with a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)
   stationary phase. The second dimension consists of a 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm mu
   column chip with an etched channel 0.5 m long and 46 mu m x 150 mu m in
   cross section wall-coated with either a trigonal tricationic
   room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) or a commercial
   poly(trifluoropropylmethyl siloxane) (OV-215) stationary phase. The
   two-stage, cryogen-free mu TM consists of a Si chip containing two
   series-coupled, square spiral channels 4.2 cm and 2.8 cm long and 250 mu
   m x 140 mu m in cross section wall-coated with PDMS. Conventional
   injection methods and flame ionization detection were used.
   Temperature-ramped separations of a simple alkane mixture using the
   RTIL-coated second-dimension (2D) mu column produced reasonably good
   peak shapes and modulation numbers; however, strong retention of polar
   compounds on the RTIL-coated 2D mu column led to excessively broad peaks
   with low 2D resolution. Substituting OV-215 as the 2D mu column
   stationary phase markedly improved the performance, and a structured 22
   min chromatogram of a 36-component mixture spanning a vapor pressure
   range of 0.027 to 13 kPa was generated with modulated peak fwhm (full
   width at half-maximum) values ranging from 90 to 643 ms and modulation
   numbers of 1-6.}},

Abstract = {{We perform coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for sodium
   dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant using a modification of the Dry Martini
   force field (Arnarez et al. 2014) with implicit water. After inclusion
   of particle mesh Ewald (PME) electrostatics, an artificially high
   dielectric constant for water (epsilon(r) = 150), and
   reparameterization, we obtain structural and thermodynamic properties of
   SDS micelles that are close to those obtained from the standard Martini
   force field with explicit water, which in turn match those of atomistic
   simulations. The gains in computational efficiency obtained by removing
   explicit water allow direct simulations of the self-assembly of SDS in
   solution. We observe surfactant exchange among micelles and micelle
   fission and fusion and obtain realistic, equilibrated micelle size
   distributions at modest computational cost, as well as a transition to
   cylindrical micelles at high surfactant concentration or with added
   salt. We further apply this parametrized force field to study the
   adsorption of SDS onto hydrophobic surfaces and calculate the adsorption
   kinetics and equilibrium adsorption isotherm. The greatly increased
   speed of computation of surfactant self-assembly made possible by this
   Dry Martini method should allow future simulation of competitive
   adsorption of multiple surfactant species to surfaces, as well as
   simulation of micellar shape transitions.}},

Title = {{Potentials of Mean Force and Escape Times of Surfactants from Micelles

Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{We calculate potentials of mean force (PMFs) and mean first passage
   times for a surfactant to escape a micelle, for both ionic sodium
   dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and nonionic ethoxylated alcohol (C12E5) micelles
   using both atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations. The PMFs are obtained by umbrella sampling and used in a
   Smoluchowski first-passage-time theory to obtain the times for a
   surfactant to escape a micelle. The calculated mean first passage time
   for an SDS molecule to break away from a micelle (with an aggregation
   number of 60) is around 2 mu s, which is consistent with previous
   experimental measurements of the fast relaxation time for exchange of
   surfactants between the micellar phase and the bulk solvent. The
   corresponding escape time calculated for a nonionic ethoxylated alcohol
   C12E5, with the same tail length as SDS, is 60 mu s, which is
   significantly longer than for SDS primarily because the PMF for
   surfactant desorption is about 3kT smaller than for C12E5. We also show
   that two coarse-grained (CG) force fields, MARTINI and SDK, give
   predictions similar to the atomistic CHARMM force field for the nonionic
   C12E5 surfactant, but for the ionic SDS surfactant, the CG simulations
   give a PMF similar to that obtained with CHARMM only if long-range
   electrostatic interactions are included in the CG simulations, rather
   than using a shifted truncated electrostatic interaction. We also
   calculate that the mean first passage time for an SDS and a C12E5 to
   escape from a latex binder surface is of the order of milliseconds,
   which is more than 100 times longer than the time for escape from the
   micelle, indicating that in latex waterborne coatings, SDS and C12E5
   surfactants likely bind preferentially to the latex polymer interface
   rather than form micelles, at least at low surfactant concentrations.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},

Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Understanding of the electrostatic properties of carbon nanotube (CNT)
   forests is essential to enable their integration in microelectronic and
   micromechanical devices. In this study, we sought to understand how the
   hierarchical geometry and morphology of CNT forests determines their
   capacitance. First, we find that at small gaps, solid micropillars have
   greater capacitance, yet at larger gaps the capacitance of the CNT
   forests is greater. The surface area of the CNT forest accessible to the
   electrostatic field was extracted by analysis of the measured
   capacitance, and, by relating the capacitance to the average density of
   CNTs in the forest, we find that the penetration depth of the
   electrostatic field is on the order of several microns. Therefore, CNT
   forests can behave as a miniature Faraday cage. The unique electrostatic
   properties of CNT forests could therefore enable their use as long-range
   proximity sensors and as shielding elements for miniature electronic
   devices. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   two NaCl-type layers A and B with respective thicknesses N-1 = 5 and N-2
   = 4 {[}N = number of edge-sharing (Pb/Bi)Se-6 octahedra along the
   central diagonal] are arranged along the c axis in such a way that the
   bridging monocapped trigonal prisms, PbSe7, are located on a
   pseudomirror plane parallel to (001). This complex atomic-scale
   structure results in a remarkably low thermal conductivity (similar to
   0.33 W m(-1) K-1 at 300 K). Electronic structure calculations and
   diffuse-reflectance measurements indicate that Pb7Bi4Se13 is a
   narrow-gap semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 0.23 eV. Multiple
   peaks and valleys were observed near the band edges, suggesting that
   Pb7Bi4Se13 is a promising compound for both n- and p-type doping.
   Electronic-transport data on the as-grown material reveal an n-type
   degenerate semiconducting behavior with a large thermopower (similar
   to-160 mu V K-1 at 300 K) and a relatively low electrical resistivity.
   The inherently low thermal conductivity of Pb7Bi4Se13 and its tunable
   electronic properties point to a high thermoelectric figure of merit for
   properly optimized samples.}},

Title = {{Toward reversing Joule heating with a phonon-absorbing heterobarrier}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Using a graded heterobarrier placed along an electron channel, phonons
   emitted in Joule heating are recycled in situ by increasing the entropy
   of phonon-absorbing electrons. The asymmetric electric potential
   distribution created by alloy grading separates the phonon absorption
   and emission regions, and emission in the larger effective-mass region
   causes momentum relaxation with smaller electron kinetic energy loss.
   These lead to smaller overall phonon emission and simultaneous
   potential-gain and self-cooling effects. Larger potential is gained with
   lower current and higher optical-phonon temperature. The self-consistent
   Monte Carlo simulations complying with the lateral momentum conservation
   combined with the entropy analysis are applied to a GaAs: Al electron
   channel with a graded heterobarrier, and under ideal lateral thermal
   isolation from surroundings, the phonon recycling efficiency reaches
   25\% of the reversible limit at 350 K, and it increases with
   temperature. The lateral momentum contributes to the transmission across
   the barrier, so partially nonconserving lateral momentum electron
   scattering (rough interface) can improve efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile health (mHealth) services cannot easily adapt to users' unique
   needs.
   We used simulations of text messaging (SMS) for improving medication
   adherence to demonstrate benefits of interventions using reinforcement
   learning (RL).
   We used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the relative impact of an
   intervention using RL to adapt SMS adherence support messages in order
   to more effectively address each non-adherent patient's adherence
   barriers, e.g., forgetfulness versus side effect concerns. SMS messages
   were assumed to improve adherence only when they matched the barriers
   for that patient. Baseline adherence and the impact of matching messages
   were estimated from literature review. RL-SMS was compared in common
   scenarios to simple reminders, random messages, and standard tailoring.
   RL could produce a 5-14 \% absolute improvement in adherence compared to
   current approaches. When adherence barriers are not accurately reported,
   RL can recognize which barriers are relevant for which patients. When
   barriers change, RL can adjust message targeting. RL can detect when
   messages are sent too frequently causing burnout.
   RL systems could make mHealth services more effective.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate and reliable identification of damage in modern engineered
   structures is essential for timely corrective measures. Vibration-based
   damage prediction has been studied extensively by virtue of its global
   damage detection ability and simplicity in practical implementation.
   However, due to noise and damping influences, the accuracy of this
   method is inhibited when direct peak detection (DPD) is utilized to
   determine resonant frequency shifts. This research investigates an
   alternative method to detect frequency shifts caused by structural
   damage based on the utilization of strongly nonlinear bifurcation
   phenomena in bistable electrical circuits coupled with piezoelectric
   transducers integrated with the structure. It is shown that frequency
   shift predictions by the proposed approach are significantly less
   susceptible to error than DPD when realistic noise and damping levels
   distort the shifting resonance peaks. As implemented alongside adaptive
   piezoelectric circuitry with tunable inductance, the new method yields
   damage location and severity identification that is significantly more
   robust and accurate than results obtained following the DPD approach.}},

Pages = {{51-91}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Credit networks are an abstraction for modeling trust among agents in a
   network. Agents who do not directly trust each other can transact
   through exchange of IOUs (obligations) along a chain of trust in the
   network. Credit networks are robust to intrusion, can enable
   transactions between strangers in exchange economies, and have the
   liquidity to support a high rate of transactions. We study the formation
   of such networks when agents strategically decide how much credit to
   extend each other. We find strong positive network formation results for
   the simplest theoretical model. When each agent trusts a fixed set of
   other agents and transacts directly only with those it trusts, all
   pure-strategy Nash equilibria are social optima. However, when we allow
   transactions over longer paths, the price of anarchy may be unbounded.
   On the positive side, when agents have a shared belief about the
   trustworthiness of each agent, simple greedy dynamics quickly converge
   to a star-shaped network, which is a social optimum. Similar star-like
   structures are found in equilibria of heuristic strategies found via
   simulation studies. In addition, we simulate environments where agents
   may have varying information about each others' trustworthiness based on
   their distance in a social network. Empirical game analysis of these
   scenarios suggests that star structures arise only when defaults are
   relatively rare, and otherwise, credit tends to be issued over short
   social distances conforming to the locality of information. Overall, we
   find that networks formed by self-interested agents achieve a high
   fraction of available value, as long as this potential value is large
   enough to enable any network to form.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Most previous analysis of Twitter user behavior has focused on
   individual information cascades and the social followers graph, in which
   the nodes for two users are connected if one follows the other. We
   instead study aggregate user behavior and the retweet graph with a focus
   on quantitative descriptions. We find that the lifetime tweet
   distribution is a type-II discrete Weibull stemming from a power law
   hazard function, that the tweet rate distribution, although
   asymptotically power law, exhibits a lognormal cutoff over finite sample
   intervals, and that the inter-tweet interval distribution is a power law
   with exponential cutoff. The retweet graph is small-world and
   scale-free, like the social graph, but less disassortative and has much
   stronger clustering. These differences are consistent with it better
   capturing the real-world social relationships of and trust between users
   than the social graph. Beyond just understanding and modeling human
   communication patterns and social networks, applications for
   alternative, decentralized microblogging systems-both predicting
   real-word performance and detecting spam-are discussed.}},

Title = {{Assessing land-use impacts by clean vehicle systems}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{112-119}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Transition of the current gasoline-based transportation system into a
   renewable fuel-based clean vehicle system has the potential to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions and improve national energy security. However,
   the realized net environmental benefit or energy security improvement is
   tightly linked to the electricity fuel mix (for electric cars and
   plug-in hybrids) and fueling strategy (for cars using alternative liquid
   fuels). In addition, different types of transportation fuels have
   significantly different demands on land resources, both on land type and
   quantity. For example, biofuel production requires large quantities of
   agricultural land, while wind farms require land with sufficient wind
   density. Furthermore, there is substantial regional variation in the
   quality of necessary resources. Regions with higher wind speeds require
   less land to produce the same amount of electricity than those with
   lower wind speed, assuming the same turbine design. Similarly, regions
   with optimal soil conditions and climate for crop cultivation require
   less land to produce the same amount of biofuel. To enable comparison of
   land demand among different fuel choices for clean vehicles, this
   research provides a county-scale assessment of land demand based on a
   ``per-vehicle-mile-traveled{''} basis. Potential clean vehicle fuels
   assessed in this study include ethanol produced from different
   feedstocks (corn and switchgrass), biodiesel from algae cultivated in
   open ponds and closed systems, and electricity produced from renewable
   sources (wind and solar). Our results show that, in general, engineered
   systems (wind electricity, solar electricity, and biodiesel from
   closed-system algae) are more land efficient than natural systems (corn
   ethanol from corn starch and stover, switchgrass ethanol, and biodiesel
   from open-pond algae). Solar electricity is the dominant regional
   optimal fuel choice from the land-use perspective for engineered systems
   while lowland switchgrass ethanol and biodiesel from open-pond algae are
   the major optimal choices for the natural systems. These results shed
   light on developing both federal and state level policies to minimize
   land-use impact for the development of a clean vehicle system. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this two part series of papers, a recent comprehensive investigation
   of residual stress distributions in pipe and vessel girth welds is
   presented, covering component wall thickness from 635 mm (1/4{''}) to
   254 mm (10{''}), radius to wall thickness ratio from 2 to 100, weld
   preparation from single ``V{''} to double ``V{''} to narrow-gap welds,
   and welding linear heating input from low (300 J/mm) to high (7,500
   J/mm). Through the use of a residual stress decomposition technique, two
   key parameters that control through-thickness residual stress
   distributions in terms of their membrane and bending content have been
   identified by examining a large number of parametric residual stress
   analysis cases. One is component radius to wall thickness ratio (r/t)
   and the other is a characteristic heat input ((Q) over cap) having a
   unit of J/mm(3). With these two parameters, a unified functional form
   for representing through-thickness residual stress profiles, along with
   its solution scheme, is proposed and demonstrated in this paper (Part I)
   for applications in weld region. A shell theory based analytical
   procedure is then introduced in Part II for estimating through-thickness
   residual stress profile at any axial distance away from weld regime. The
   effectiveness of the analytical estimation procedure is then confirmed
   by finite element residual stress solutions on a large number of
   component configurations and welding conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a common and potentially
   catastrophic knee joint injury, afflicting a large number of males and
   particularly females annually. Apart from the obvious acute injury
   events, it also presents with significant long-term morbidities, in
   which osteoarthritis (OA) is a frequent and debilitative outcome. With
   these facts in mind, a vast amount of research has been undertaken over
   the past five decades geared toward characterizing the structural and
   mechanical behaviors of the native ACL tissue under various external
   load applications. While these efforts have afforded important insights,
   both in terms of understanding treating and rehabilitating ACL injuries;
   injury rates, their well-established sex-based disparity, and long-term
   sequelae have endured. In reviewing the expanse of literature conducted
   to date in this area, this paper identifies important knowledge gaps
   that contribute directly to this long-standing clinical dilemma. In
   particular, the following limitations remain. First, minimal data exist
   that accurately describe native ACL mechanics under the extreme loading
   rates synonymous with actual injury. Second, current ACL mechanical data
   are typically derived from isolated and oversimplified strain estimates
   that fail to adequately capture the true 3D mechanical response of this
   anatomically complex structure. Third, graft tissues commonly chosen to
   reconstruct the ruptured ACL are mechanically suboptimal, being
   overdesigned for stiffness compared to the native tissue. The net result
   is an increased risk of rerupture and a modified and potentially
   hazardous habitual joint contact profile. These major limitations appear
   to warrant explicit research attention moving forward in order to
   successfully maintain/restore optimal knee joint function and long-term
   life quality in a large number of otherwise healthy individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Representing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributable to plug-in
   electric vehicles (PEV) in vehicle GHG emissions regulations is complex
   because of spatial and temporal variation in fueling sources and vehicle
   use. Previous work has shown that the environmental performance of PEVs
   significantly varies depending on the characteristics of the electricity
   grid and how the vehicle is driven. This article evaluates the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) GHG emissions accounting
   methodology in current and future standards for new electrified
   vehicles. The current approach employed by the EPA in their 2017-2025
   model year light-duty vehicle GHG regulation is compared with an
   accounting mechanism where the actual regional sales of PEVs, and the
   regional electricity emission factor in the year sold, are used to
   determine vehicle compliance value. Changes to the electricity grid over
   time and regional vehicle sales are included in the modeling efforts. A
   projection of a future GHG regulation past the 2017-2025 rule is used to
   observe the effect of such a regional regulation. The results showed
   that the complexity involved in tracking and accounting for regional PEV
   sales will not dramatically increase the effectiveness of the
   regulations to capture PEV electricity-related GHG emissions in the
   absence of a major policy shift. A discussion of the feasibility and
   effectiveness of a regional standard for PEVs, and notable examples of
   region-specific regulations instated in past energy policies, is also
   addressed.}},

Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{341-348}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The field of nanoscience is delivering increasingly intricate yet
   elegant geometric structures incorporating an ever-expanding palette of
   materials. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a powerful driver of this
   field, providing exceptionally conformal coatings spanning the periodic
   table and atomic-scale precision independent of substrate geometry. This
   versatility is intrinsic to ALD and results from sequential and
   self-limiting surface reactions. This characteristic facilitates digital
   synthesis, in which the film grows linearly with the number of reaction
   cycles. While the majority of ALD processes identified to date produce
   metal oxides, novel applications in areas such as energy storage,
   catalysis, and nanophotonics are motivating interest in sulfide
   materials. Recent progress in ALD of sulfides has expanded the diversity
   of accessible materials as well as a more complete understanding of the
   unique chalcogenide surface chemistry.
   ALD of sulfide materials typically uses metalorganic precursors and
   hydrogen sulfide (H2S). As in oxide ALD, the precursor chemistry is
   critical to controlling both the film growth and properties including
   roughness, crystallinity, and impurity levels. By modification of the
   precursor sequence, multicomponent sulfides have been deposited,
   although challenges remain because of the higher propensity for cation
   exchange reactions, greater diffusion rates, and unintentional annealing
   of this more labile class of materials. A deeper understanding of these
   surface chemical reactions has been achieved through a combination of in
   situ studies and quantum-chemical calculations. As this understanding
   matures, so does our ability to deterministically tailor film properties
   to new applications and more sophisticated devices.
   This Account highlights the attributes of ALD chemistry that are unique
   to metal sulfides and surveys recent applications of these materials in
   photovoltaics, energy storage, and photonics. Within each application
   space, the benefits and challenges of novel ALD processes are emphasized
   and common trends are summarized. We conclude with a perspective on
   potential future directions for metal chalcogenide ALD as well as
   untapped opportunities. Finally, we consider challenges that must be
   addressed prior to implementing ALD metal sulfides into future device
   architectures.}},

Abstract = {{G5-NH2-TAMRAn (n = 1-4, 5+, and 1.5(avg)) were prepared with n = 1-4 as

   dye:dendrimer ratios with a mean of 1.5 dye per dendrimer. The
   absorption intensity increased sublinearly with n whereas the
   fluorescence emission and lifetime decreased with an increasing number
   of dyes per dendrimer. Flow cytometry was employed to quantify uptake
   into HEK293A cells. Dendrimers with 2-4 dyes were found to have greater
   uptake than dendrimer with a single dye. Fluorescence lifetime imaging
   microscopy (FLIM) showed that the different dye:dendrimer ratio alone

   vivo targeting. The ease of incorporating azidohomoalanine in peptides
   and efficient reaction with the dialkyne linker enable this technique to
   potentially be used as a general method for labeling a helices. This
   strategy should be useful for imaging beta cells in diabetes research
   and in developing and testing other peptide targeting agents.}},

Title = {{Energy management of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with unknown trip

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel control strategy for plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicles (PHEV). The minimization of the utility factor weighted fuel
   consumption (FCUFW), which represents the average fuel consumption in
   numerous trips, is firstly proposed as the objective of the energy
   management. In previous studies, the trip length is usually assumed to
   be known. Then, if it is shorter than the all-electric range (AER), a
   Charge Depleting Charge Sustaining (CDCS) strategy leads to the minimum
   fuel consumption; otherwise, a blended strategy that spends down battery
   energy almost uniformly brings the minimum fuel consumption.
   Nevertheless, the trip length is not always known before trip in real
   life. To deal with the cases of unknown trip length, this paper proposes
   a Range ADaptive Optimal Control (RADOC) strategy to minimize the FCUFW,
   which utilizes the statistical information of the trip length. The RADOC
   strategy was verified by dynamic programming and was found to be
   somewhere in between the blended and CDCS strategies. Depending on the
   nature of the trips, the RADOC strategy was found to improve FCUFW
   between 0.10\% and 4.07\% compared with the CDCS strategy. The RADOC
   strategy is very close to the CDCS strategy when the PREY is used in
   regular daily driving. On the contrary, the RADOC solution exhibits a
   ``uniform battery discharging{''} behavior similar to the blended
   strategy for urban utility vehicles or taxis. The behavior of the RADOC
   strategy is also studied for different battery sizes and driving cycles.

Abstract = {{This research presents the finite element modeling (FEM) of
   human-specific computed tomography (CT) data to study the effect of bone
   prominences on contact stress in the shoulder for prevention of pressure
   ulcers. The 3D geometry of scapula, skin, and surrounding soft tissues
   in the shoulder was reconstructed based on the anonymous CT data of a
   human subject in a prone posture (without loading on the shoulder) for
   FEM analysis of the contact stress. FEM analysis results show that the
   maximum stress is located at the prominence of the scapula with sharp
   bone geometry. This demonstrates that stress concentration at the bone
   prominence is a significant factor to cause the high contact stress,
   which is a source for pressure ulcers. For experimental validation, a
   physical shoulder model manufactured by 3D printing of the bone geometry
   and the mold for molding of tissue-mimicking silicone was developed.
   Compression tests of the mattress foam and silicone were conducted to
   find the nonlinear stress strain relations as inputs for FEM.
   Experiments of compressing the shoulder model against the foam were
   carried out. Three flexible force sensors were embedded inside the model
   to measure the contact forces and compared to the FEM predictions.
   Results show that the FEM predicted forces match well with the
   experimental measurements and demonstrate that FEM can accurately
   predict the stress distributions in the shoulder to study the effect of
   bone geometry on the inception of pressure ulcers. (C) 2015 IPEM.

Abstract = {{This work addresses the behavior of fluttering motion in a hinged
   vertical flat plate allowed to rotate about its vertical axis, under the
   influence of uniform current This problem has one degree of freedom and
   the study aims to understand the fluttering behavior. Fluttering
   (rotational oscillations) is a phenomenon that may occur when a leaf, a
   playing card, airplane debris or other more complex objects fall. It may
   also occur during the pendulous installation method of a large manifold
   (PIM) in an offshore deep water site. At first, the experimental study
   started with the static case. Afterward, the dimensional analysis,
   experiments and quasi-steady modeling devised a natural frequency for
   the fluttering motion. This frequency is linearly proportional to the
   incoming flow velocity and inversely proportional to the flat plate
   width. This response frequency of fluttering is due to a flow behavior
   that maybe systematized as a practically linear ``hydrodynamic torsional
   spring{''} and the inertia considering the added mass. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Diesel exhaust emissions contain numerous semivolatile organic compounds
   (SVOCs) for which emission information is limited, especially for idling
   conditions, new fuels and the new after-treatment systems. This study
   investigates exhaust emissions of particulate matter (PM), polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitro-PAHs (NPAHs), and sterane and hopane
   petroleum biomarkers from a heavy-duty (6.4 L) diesel engine at various
   loads (idle, 600 and 900 kPa BMEP), with three types of fuel (ultra-low
   sulfur diesel or ULSD, Swedish low aromatic diesel, and neat soybean
   biodiesel), and with and without a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and
   diesel particulate filter (DPF). Swedish diesel and biodiesel reduced
   emissions of PM2.5, Sigma(15)PAHs, Sigma(11)NPAHs, Sigma(5)Hopanes and
   Sigma(6)Steranes, and biodiesel resulted in the larger reductions.
   However, idling emissions increased for benzo{[}k]fluoranthene (Swedish
   diesel), 5-nitroacenaphthene (biodiesel) and PM2.5 (biodiesel), a
   significant result given the attention to exposures from idling vehicles
   and the toxicity of high-molecular-weight PAHs and NPAHs. The DOC + DPF
   combination reduced PM2.5 and SVOC emissions during DPF loading (>99\%
   reduction) and DPF regeneration (83-99\%). The toxicity of diesel
   exhaust, in terms of the estimated carcinogenic risk, was greatly
   reduced using Swedish diesel, biodiesel fuels and the DOC + DPF. PAH
   profiles showed high abundances of three and four ring compounds as well
   as naphthalene; NPAH profiles were dominated by nitronaphthalenes,
   1-nitropyrene and 9-nitroanthracene. Both the emission rate and the
   composition of diesel exhaust depended strongly on fuel type, engine
   load and after-treatment system. The emissions data and chemical
   profiles presented are relevant to the development of emission
   inventories and exposure and risk assessments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{94-104}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Researchers at the University of Michigan have recently developed a new
   class of concrete, named High Strength-High Ductility Concrete (HSHDC),
   which possesses exceptional combination of compressive strength (>150
   MPa) and tensile ductility (>3\%) under quasi-static loads. The
   structural applications of HSHDC for withstanding extreme events, such
   as hurricanes, earthquakes, impacts, and blasts, require an
   understanding of its dynamic behavior at high strain rates. This
   research experimentally investigates the effects of strain rate (from
   10(-4)/s to 10/s) on the composite tensile properties and the
   micro-scale fiber/matrix interaction properties of HSHDC. A
   micromechanics-based scale-linking model is used to analytically explain
   the composite-scale rate effects based on the micro-scale rate effects.
   Due to the unique interactions between the Polyethylene fibers and
   densely packed ultra-high strength matrix of HSHDC, novel rate effects
   are revealed, which are expected to be foundational for the future
   development of this class of materials for improving infrastructure
   resilience. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid approach to model guided wave propagation
   in composite laminates. The global matrix approach is used to determine
   the displacement field surrounding a piezoelectric actuator. The
   displacement field is then enforced in a specified region of a numerical
   model that employs the local interaction simulation approach. This
   hybrid approach improves upon previous local interaction simulation
   approach methods that prescribe in-plane displacements within the
   actuator profile to model actuation. Additionally, it circumvents the
   problem of modeling nonrectangular actuators in the Cartesian
   discretization in the local interaction simulation approach. Results
   show that the hybrid model outperforms previous local interaction
   simulation approach models when considering actuation from circular,
   square, and composite long-range variable-direction emitting radar
   actuators. The hybrid model produces wave propagation time histories
   that closely match the baseline global matrix method and successfully
   capture directional effects resulting from the anisotropic nature of
   composite plates. The dependence of the results on in-plane
   discretization size is examined for aluminum, cross-ply, unidirectional,
   and quasi-isotropic plates. The results for the aluminum and
   unidirectional plates show considerable dependence on the in-plane cell
   dimensions, but that dependence is less pronounced for the cross-ply and

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a mixed-variable optimization
   framework for the aeroelastic analysis and design of active twist

   optimization, the cross-sectional layout is designed using continuous
   and discrete design variables for an active composite rotor blade to
   maximize the dynamic active twist while satisfying a series of
   constraints on blade cross-section parameters, stiffness, and strength.
   The optimization framework developed includes the Intelligent

   University of Michigan/Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional analysis
   code for active cross-sectional analysis, and Rotorcraft Comprehensive
   Analysis Software for aeroelastic analysis of the active twist rotor

Title = {{Balancing oxygen diffusion and convection in spiral microfluidics to
   mimic radial biological gradients}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL MICRODEVICES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Biological gradients are more than linear, one-dimensional
   phenomena-they often manifest radial geometries superimposed over tissue
   features and in turn, elicit a spatial response. In wound healing,
   injury to tissue produces a hypoxic gradient towards the center of the
   wound, and wound cells respond to this by secreting growth hormones to
   promote healing. Despite this spatial element in tissue hypoxia, most in
   vitro hypoxia techniques rely on linear, diffusion-based gradients of
   limited dimensions. To demonstrate a large area, radial hypoxia
   gradient, a concentric spiral microfluidics was devised to balance
   oxygen diffusion against nitrogen convection. The devices were
   fabricated using only a simple robotic cutter and soft lithography. With
   these spirals, spatial gradients of 3-15 \% oxygen were delivered to
   fibroblast cells seeded across a gas-permeable membrane to modulate VEGF
   secretions. This technique opens the door for more studies on hypoxic
   gradients in wound healing and a number of tissue oxygen applications.}},

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{430-446}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a two-dimensional two-phase model is developed for a
   passive alkaline anion exchange membrane direct methanol fuel cell
   (AAEM-DMFC) to understand the role of micro-porous layer (MPL) and the
   effect of porous media wettability on species transport. The results
   indicate that different regions of polarization curve exhibit different
   dependence on the methanol feed concentration. Anode MPL can act as the
   methanol diffusion barrier to retard the methanol mass transport and
   thus mitigate the methanol crossover. This effect becomes more
   significant by increasing anode MPL hydrophobicity, which facilitates
   the use of highly concentrated methanol fuel. However, the insertion of
   cathode MPL and changes in the wettability of cathode porous layers show
   insignificant effects on the methanol crossover. Moreover, the influence
   of MPL on the water transport depends on the current density. Less water
   crossover can be achieved by reducing the water diffusion or enhancing
   the back-diffusion through the membrane. Ultimately, a favorable water
   distribution and lower methanol crossover might be achieved by designing
   porous layers with desired properties. The simulation results presented
   in this study may help guide the optimization of water management and
   the mitigation of methanol crossover in passive AAEM-DMFC. (C) 2014

Title = {{Display Clutter: A Review of Definitions and Measurement Techniques}},
Journal = {{HUMAN FACTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{61-100}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We aimed to synthesize the literature on display clutter by
   reviewing definitions and measurement techniques and to develop a
   comprehensive, ergonomics-oriented perspective on clutter. We provide
   guidance for the selection of measurement approaches that can capture
   the various aspects and effects of clutter on visual search in
   particular.
   Background: There is agreement that clutter may represent a significant
   problem to operators. The challenge is to determine the ideal middle
   ground between excessive data and insufficient information. However,
   definitions of clutter vary widely, which explains the range of
   measurement approaches, including image-processing algorithms,
   performance evaluation, subjective evaluation, and eye tracking. It is
   important to understand the affordances of each technique and provide
   guidance for their use.
   Method: We provide a systematic review of clutter definitions and
   develop a performance-oriented perspective for ergonomics research.
   Next, we present a critical overview of clutter measurement approaches.
   The benefits and limitations of each technique are detailed, and
   recommendations for best practice are provided.
   Results: From an ergonomics perspective, clutter matters to the extent
   that it affects performance, particularly, visual search. A combination
   of measurement techniques can be employed in order to assess the
   performance costs stemming from the multiple aspects of clutter.
   Conclusion: Display clutter is a multifaceted construct that is a
   problem when it results in performance and attentional costs. The
   assessment of these costs is critical and requires the use of
   appropriate and complementary techniques.
   Application: It is important that the performance costs of clutter are
   detected reliably to be able to better support attention management.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel driver-vehicle interface for
   individuals with severe neuromuscular disabilities to use intelligent
   vehicles by using P300 and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)
   brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to select a destination and test its
   performance in the laboratory and real driving conditions. The proposed
   interface consists of two components: the selection component based on a
   P300 BCI and the confirmation component based on an SSVEP BCI.
   Furthermore, the accuracy and selection time models of the interface are
   built to help analyze the performance of the entire system. Experimental
   results from 16 participants collected in the laboratory and real
   driving scenarios show that the average accuracy of the system in the
   real driving conditions is about 99\% with an average selection time of
   about 26 s. More importantly, the proposed system improves the accuracy
   of destination selection compared with a single P300 BCI-based selection
   system, particularly for those participants with relatively low level of
   accuracy in using the P300 BCI. This study not only provides individuals
   with severe motor disabilities with an interface to use intelligent
   vehicles and thus improve their mobility, but also facilitates the
   research on driver-vehicle interface, multimodal interaction, and
   intelligent vehicles. Furthermore, it opens an avenue on how cognitive
   neuroscience may be applied to intelligent vehicles.}},

Title = {{Fast X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction Using a Linearized Augmented
   Lagrangian Method With Ordered Subsets}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{388-399}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Augmented Lagrangian (AL) methods for solving convex optimization
   problems with linear constraints are attractive for imaging applications
   with composite cost functions due to the empirical fast convergence rate
   under weak conditions. However, for problems such as X-ray computed
   tomography (CT) image reconstruction, where the inner least-squares
   problem is challenging and requires iterations, AL methods can be slow.
   This paper focuses on solving regularized (weighted) least-squares
   problems using a linearized variant of AL methods that replaces the
   quadratic AL penalty term in the scaled augmented Lagrangian with its
   separable quadratic surrogate function, leading to a simpler
   ordered-subsets (OS) accelerable splitting-based algorithm, OS-LALM. To
   further accelerate the proposed algorithm, we use a second-order
   recursive system analysis to design a deterministic downward
   continuation approach that avoids tedious parameter tuning and provides
   fast convergence. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm
   significantly accelerates the convergence of X-ray CT image
   reconstruction with negligible overhead and can reduce OS artifacts when
   using many subsets.}},

Abstract = {{Sparsity-promoting regularization is useful for combining compressed
   sensing assumptions with parallel MRI for reducing scan time while
   preserving image quality. Variable splitting algorithms are the current
   state-of-the-art algorithms for SENSE-type MR image reconstruction with
   sparsity-promoting regularization. These methods are very general and
   have been observed to work with almost any regularizer; however, the
   tuning of associated convergence parameters is a commonly-cited
   hindrance in their adoption. Conversely, majorize-minimize algorithms
   based on a single Lipschitz constant have been observed to be slow in
   shift-variant applications such as SENSE-type MR image reconstruction
   since the associated Lipschitz constants are loose bounds for the
   shift-variant behavior. This paper bridges the gap between the Lipschitz
   constant and the shift-variant aspects of SENSE-type MR imaging by
   introducing majorizing matrices in the range of the regularizer matrix.
   The proposed majorize-minimize methods (called BARISTA) converge faster
   than state-of-the-art variable splitting algorithms when combined with
   momentum acceleration and adaptive momentum restarting. Furthermore, the
   tuning parameters associated with the proposed methods are unitless
   convergence tolerances that are easier to choose than the constraint
   penalty parameters required by variable splitting algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical image reconstruction methods for X-ray computed tomography
   (CT) provide improved spatial resolution and noise properties over
   conventional filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction, along with
   other potential advantages such as reduced patient dose and artifacts.
   Conventional regularized image reconstruction leads to spatially variant
   spatial resolution and noise characteristics because of interactions
   between the system models and the regularization. Previous
   regularization design methods aiming to solve such issues mostly rely on
   circulant approximations of the Fisher information matrix that are very
   inaccurate for undersampled geometries like short-scan cone-beam CT.
   This paper extends the regularization method proposed in {[}1] to 3-D
   cone-beam CT by introducing a hypothetical scanning geometry that helps
   address the sampling properties. The proposed regularization designs
   were compared with the original method in {[}1] with both phantom
   simulation and clinical reconstruction in 3-D axial X-ray CT. The
   proposed regularization methods yield improved spatial resolution or
   noise uniformity in statistical image reconstruction for short-scan
   axial cone-beam CT.}},

Abstract = {{Minimally invasive, injectable bone tissue engineering therapies offer
   the potential to facilitate orthopedic repair procedures, including in
   indications where enhanced bone regeneration is needed for complete
   healing. In this study, we developed a dual-phase tissue construct
   consisting of osteogenic (Osteo) and vasculogenic (Vasculo) components.
   A modular tissue engineering approach was used to create
   collagen/fibrin/hydroxyapatite (COL/FIB/HA) hydrogel microbeads
   containing embedded human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells
   (bmMSC). These microbeads were predifferentiated toward the osteogenic
   lineage in vitro for 14 days, and they were then embedded within a
   COL/FIB vasculogenic phase containing a coculture of undifferentiated
   bmMSC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In vitro
   studies demonstrated homogenous dispersion of microbeads within the
   outer phase, with endothelial network formation around the microbeads
   over 14 days in the coculture conditions. Subcutaneous injection into
   immunodeficient mice was used to investigate the ability of dual-phase
   (Osteo+Vasculo) and control (Osteo, Vasculo, Blank) constructs to form
   neovasculature and ectopic bone. Laser Doppler imaging demonstrated
   blood perfusion through all constructs at 1, 4, and 8 weeks
   postimplantation. Histological quantification of total vessel density
   showed no significant differences between the conditions. Microcomputed
   tomography indicated significantly higher ectopic bone volume (BV) in
   the Osteo condition at 4 weeks. At 8 weeks both the Osteo and Blank
   groups exhibited higher BV compared to the Vasculo and dual
   Osteo+Vasculo groups. These data not only show that osteogenic
   microbeads can be used to induce ectopic bone formation, but also
   suggest an inhibitory effect on BV when undifferentiated bmMSC and HUVEC
   were included in dual-phase constructs. This work may lead to improved
   methods for engineering vascularized bone tissue, and to injectable
   therapies for the treatment of orthopedic pathologies in which bone
   regeneration is delayed or prevented.}},

   municipal solid waste}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{184-190}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Duplicate carefully-characterized municipal solid waste (MSW) specimens
   were reconstituted with waste constituents obtained from a MSW landfill
   and biodegraded in large-scale landfill simulators for about a year.
   Repeatability and relationships between changes in physical, chemical,
   and microbial characteristics taking place during the biodegradation
   process were evaluated. Parameters such as rate of change of soluble
   chemical oxygen demand in the leachate (r(sCOD)), rate of methane
   generation (r(CH4)), rate of specimen volume reduction (r(Vt)), DNA
   concentration in the leachate, and archaeal community structures in the
   leachate and solid waste were monitored during operation. The DNA
   concentration in the leachate was correlated to r(CH4) and r(Vt). The
   r(CH4) was related to r(sCOD)) and r(Vt) when waste biodegradation was
   intensive. The structures of archaeal communities in the leachate and
   solid waste of both simulators were very similar and Methanobacteriaceae
   were the dominant archaeal family throughout the testing period.
   Monitoring the chemical and microbial characteristics of the leachate
   was informative of the bio-degradation process and volume reduction in
   the simulators, suggesting that leachate monitoring could be informative
   of the extent of biodegradation in a full-scale landfill. (C) 2014

Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{187-195}},
Month = {{FEB-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Spacecraft attitude control in the presence of actuator saturation is
   considered. The attitude controller developed has two components: a
   proportional component and an angular velocity component. The
   proportional control has a special form that depends on the attitude
   parameterization. The angular velocity control is realized by a strictly
   positive real system with its own input nonlinearity. The strictly
   positive real system can filter noise in the angular velocity
   measurement With this control architecture the torques applied to the
   body are guaranteed to be below a predetermined value, thus preventing
   saturation of the actuators. The closed-loop equilibrium point
   corresponding to the desired attitude is shown to be asymptotically
   stable. Additionally, the control law does not require specific
   knowledge of the body's inertia properties, and is therefore robust to
   such modelling errors. (C) 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Surface-templated hydrogel patterns prompt matrix-dependent migration of
   breast cancer cells towards chemokine-secreting cells}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{68-77}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel technique for fabricating spatially defined
   cell-laden collagen hydrogels, using patterned, non-adhesive
   polyacrylamide-coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces as a
   template. Precisely patterned embedded co-cultures of breast cancer
   cells and chemokine-producing cells generated with this technique
   revealed matrix-dependent and chemokine isoform-dependent migration of
   cancer cells. CXCL12 chemokine-secreting cells induce significantly more
   chemotaxis of cancer cells when the 3-D extracellular matrix (ECM)
   includes components that bind the secreted CXCL12 chemokines.
   Experimental observations using cells that secrete CXCL12 isoforms with
   different matrix affinities together with computational simulations show
   that stronger ligand-matrix interactions sharpen chemoattractant
   gradients, leading to increased chemotaxis of the CXCL12
   gradient-sensing CXCR4 receptor-expressing (CXCR4+) cells patterned in
   the hydrogel. These results extend our recent report on CXCL12
   isoform-dependent chemotaxis studies from 2-D to 3-D environments and
   additionally reveal the important role of ECM composition. The developed
   technology is simple, versatile and robust; and as
   chemoattractant-matrix interactions are common, the methods described
   here should be broadly applicable for study of physiological migration
   of many different cell types in response to a variety of
   chemoattractants. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Optimization for a hybrid energy storage system in electric vehicles
   using dynamic programing approach}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{151-162}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper utilizes the dynamic programming (DP) approach to deal with
   the integrated optimization problem for deriving the best configuration
   and energy split strategies of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS),
   including a battery and a supercapacitor (SC), for an electric city bus.
   Within the optimization process, a preset cost function is employed to
   evaluate the HESS life cycle cost based on a dynamic degradation model
   of the LiFePO4 battery, which is initially proposed by us. For system
   hybridization, the battery size is optimized according to the requested
   minimal mileage, while the optimal configuration of the SC pack (i.e.,
   the numbers of the SC modules in series and parallel) is determined
   using the DP approach. It is shown that the life cycle cost of the HESS
   initially decreases rapidly with the addition of SCs, though the rate of
   this reduction decreases as the amount of SC increases. The HESS
   candidates occurring in the transition area can therefore be regarded as
   the best solutions. For the energy split strategy, several control rules
   can be extracted from the DP results, and a near-optimal rule-based
   strategy is proposed in this paper. When compared to the battery-only
   configuration, the HESS controlled by the rule-based strategy can reduce
   47\% and 60\% of the ESS life cycle cost along the typical China Bus
   Driving Cycle and the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, respectively.
   This paper also proves that a well-tuned rule-based strategy, which can
   be easily implemented in a vehicle, presents rather good performance
   when compared to the DP approach. In addition, the proposed strategy
   performance can be further improved by increasing the SC usage. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The results of an experimental investigation of UHP-FRC tensile response
   under a range of low strain rates are presented. The strain rate
   dependent tests are conducted on dogbone specimens using a hydraulic
   servo-controlled testing machine. The experimental variables are strain
   rate, which ranges from 0.0001 1/s to 0.1 1/s, fiber type, and fiber
   volume fraction. Five different types of fibers are considered including
   straight and twisted fibers with different geometric properties. The
   rate sensitivity of the composite material in tension is evaluated in
   terms of its first cracking strength, post-cracking strength, energy
   absorption capacity, strain capacity, elastic modulus, fiber tensile
   stress and number of cracks. The test results show pronounced rate
   effects on post-cracking strength and energy absorption capacity.
   Further, post cracking strength varies linearly with the fiber
   reinforcing index and energy absorption capacity varies linearly with
   the product of the fiber length and the reinforcing index, as predicted
   from the theory for fiber reinforced concrete. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   decoder of a GF(64) (160, 80) regular-(2, 4) NB-LDPC code in 65 nm CMOS.
   The reduced number of edges in NB-LDPC code's factor graph permits a low
   wiring overhead in the fully parallel architecture. The throughput is
   further improved by a one-step look-ahead check node design that
   increases the clock frequency to 700 MHz, and the interleaving of
   variable node and check node operations that shortens one decoding
   iteration to 47 clock cycles. We allow each processing node to detect
   its own convergence and apply dynamic clock gating to save power. When
   all processing nodes have been clock gated, the decoder terminates and
   continues with the next input to increase the throughput to 1.22 Gb/s.
   The dynamic clock gating and decoder termination improve the energy
   efficiency to 3.03 nJ/b, or 259 pJ/b/iteration, at 1.0 V and 700 MHz.
   Voltage scaling to 675 mV improves the energy efficiency to 89
   pJ/b/iteration for a throughput of 698 Mb/s at 400 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has shown the utility of using simplified models with
   prescribed burn rates to assess the potential of advanced combustion
   strategies to increase engine efficiency. However, this approach can be
   improved by incorporating knock and flammability limits. This work
   incorporates such limits using a combination of simplified conceptual
   models that are based on theoretical understanding of knock and flame
   phenomenon and calibration with experimental results. Using this method,
   the ideal (unconstrained) and feasible (constrained by knock and
   flammability) potential of a high efficiency gasoline and E85 engine are
   compared against a baseline naturally aspirated gasoline engine.
   Turbocharging, dilution with EGR, and higher compression ratios are used
   to increase the efficiency potential of the high efficiency gasoline and
   E85 engines. Results demonstrate the benefit of using this simplified
   approach in modeling high efficiency engines: the high efficiency
   gasoline engine is most limited by knock while the E85 engine is limited
   much less; also increased EGR can be used for the E85 engine due to the
   higher flame speeds of ethanol. Fuel economy maps are created for each
   engine/fuel strategy and evaluated in a vehicle model to obtain fuel
   economy results. Results comparing feasible engines show that peak brake
   thermal efficiency (BTE) is increased by 11.4\% for the high efficiency
   gasoline engine and 17.8\% for the E85 engine, as compared to the
   baseline gasoline engine. Projected vehicle fuel economy (energy
   equivalent) improvements are 30.1\% for the high efficiency gasoline,
   and 40.9\% for the E85 engine relative to baseline.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This letter reports on the evaluation of an unconventional approach to
   microultrasonic machining in which the workpiece is vibrated while the
   tool remains static. The vibration of the workpiece, and not the tool,
   alleviates the accumulation and the agglomeration of the slurry
   particles and debris between the machined features. This approach is
   appealing for batch mode pattern transfer of closely packed features
   into ceramics and glass. However, the question of how the workpiece
   vibration will cause selective machining of features on the opposing
   tool surface has not been addressed. In this effort, fluidic modeling is
   performed to study slurry flow due to workpiece vibration. The modeling
   reveals a higher slurry velocity (2.20-2.46 m/s) in the target machining
   regions confined by the proximity of the tool tips and a lower velocity
   (0.16-0.50 m/s) elsewhere. To demonstrate and characterize the resulting
   machining ability, arrayed tools made from stainless steel \#304 with
   feature sizes ranging from 5-50 mu m were used on flat workpieces of
   fused silica. At 20-kHz vibration frequency and 12-mu m
   tool-to-workpiece separation, the average machining rates ranged from
   6-90 nm/s for workpiece vibration amplitudes ranging from 1-5 mu m. The
   average surface roughness, Sa, was 40-65 nm. The tool wear, i.e., the
   ratio of the tool height worn to the machined depth, was <4\%.

Title = {{An Implantable X-Ray-Based Blood Pressure Microsensor for Coronary
   In-Stent Restenosis Surveillance and Prevention}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of mortality in the U.S. and
   percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement is a common
   treatment. Stents often fail through coronary in-stent restenosis.
   Periodically monitoring restenosis could help alert the physician of any
   problems earlier, reduce myocardial reinfarctions, and improve outcomes.
   Currently, there are no inexpensive and noninvasive techniques to
   monitor stent patency. We describe an X-ray-addressable blood pressure
   (X-BP) microsensor. The X-BP has a column of radio-opaque liquid that
   changes its length with blood pressure. The X-BP allows for the
   noninvasive evaluation of the pressure drop across a stent and the
   fractional flow reserve (FFR) on radiographs. A FFR threshold of
   0.75-0.8 is clinically established as the cutoff for the identification
   of hemodynamically significant stenosis that requires intervention. The
   X-BP membrane was modeled and the X-ray signal-to-noise ratio of
   different sensor dimensions was experimentally determined. Based on this
   data, optimal design parameters were selected. The sensor was prototyped
   and tested under microscope with radiographs and video fluoroscopy. The
   sensor has a potential dynamic range of 0-200 mmHg, and can reliably
   resolve the clinically important pressure drop of 20\%-25\% across the
   dynamic range for an FFR value of 0.8-0.75 or less. The X-BP also has a
   time constant <32 ms with no appreciable hysteresis. We believe this
   sensor can be used for periodic screening of coronary in-stent
   restenosis. {[}2014-0121]}},

Abstract = {{Many chronic neuroscience studies require neural probes that can
   reliably record with a large number of electrodes in a densely
   configured array. Previous works have shown that adverse tissue reaction
   can be significantly reduced as probe shanks are scaled down toward
   subcellular dimensions. In addition, flexible probes can mitigate shear
   stress-induced tissue damage due to micromotion. However, both size
   reduction and flexibility compromise probe's ability to penetrate the
   pia mater, especially when many electrodes are distributed across
   multiple probe shanks. In this paper, we present a method to
   lithographically pattern a biodegradable silk coating that provides
   temporary mechanical stiffness for the surgical insertion of flexible
   probes without any conventional design constraints on the probe size,
   shape, or material. After insertion, the silk is completely dissolved in
   the tissue, only leaving the flexible minimum-geometry probes inside the
   brain. We validated the design by successfully inserting silk-backed
   64-channel parylene probes into the motor cortex of Long-Evans rats (n =
   6) and recorded in vivo neural activity for six weeks. {[}2014-0249]}},

Title = {{Comparison of spike sorting and thresholding of voltage waveforms for
   intracortical brain-machine interface performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective. For intracortical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), action
   potential voltage waveforms are often sorted to separate out individual
   neurons. If these neurons contain independent tuning information, this
   process could increase BMI performance. However, the sorting of action
   potentials ('spikes') requires high sampling rates and is
   computationally expensive. To explicitly define the difference between
   spike sorting and alternative methods, we quantified BMI decoder
   performance when using threshold-crossing events versus sorted action
   potentials. Approach. We used data sets from 58 experimental sessions
   from two rhesus macaques implanted with Utah arrays. Data were recorded
   while the animals performed a center-out reaching task with seven
   different angles. For spike sorting, neural signals were sorted into
   individual units by using a mixture of Gaussians to cluster the first
   four principal components of the waveforms. For thresholding events,
   spikes that simply crossed a set threshold were retained. We decoded the
   data offline using both a Naive Bayes classifier for reaching direction
   and a linear regression to evaluate hand position. Main results. We
   found the highest performance for thresholding when placing a threshold
   between -3 and -4.5 x V-rms. Spike sorted data outperformed thresholded
   data for one animal but not the other. The mean Naive Bayes
   classification accuracy for sorted data was 88.5\% and changed by 5\% on
   average when data were thresholded. The mean correlation coefficient for
   sorted data was 0.92, and changed by 0.015 on average when thresholded.
   Significance. For prosthetics applications, these results imply that
   when thresholding is used instead of spike sorting, only a small amount
   of performance may be lost. The utilization of threshold-crossing events
   may significantly extend the lifetime of a device because these events
   are often still detectable once single neurons are no longer isolated.}},

Abstract = {{Tinnitus has been associated with enhanced central gain manifested by
   increased spontaneous activity and sound-evoked firing rates of
   principal neurons at various stations of the auditory pathway. Yet, the
   mechanisms leading to these modifications are not well understood. In a
   recent in vivo study, we demonstrated that stimulus-timing-dependent
   bimodal plasticity mediates modifications of spontaneous and tone-evoked
   responses of fusiform cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) of the
   guinea pig. Fusiform cells from sham animals showed primarily Hebbian
   learning rules while noise-exposed animals showed primarily anti-Hebbian
   rules, with broadened profiles for the animals with behaviorally
   verified tinnitus (Koehler SD, Shore SE. J Neurosci 33: 19647-19656,
   2013a). In the present study we show that well-timed bimodal stimulation
   induces alterations in the rate-level functions (RLFs) of fusiform
   cells. The RLF gains and maximum amplitudes show Hebbian modifications
   in sham and no-tinnitus animals but anti-Hebbian modifications in

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To assess the current pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP)
   workforce and to investigate the impact of potential policy changes to
   address forecasted shortages.
   METHODS: We modeled the admission of students into nursing bachelor's
   programs and followed them through advanced clinical programs.
   Prediction models were combined with optimal decision-making to
   determine best-case scenario admission levels. We computed 2 measures:
   (1) the absolute shortage and (2) the expected number of years until the
   PNP workforce will be able to fully satisfy PNP demand (ie,
   self-sufficiency).
   RESULTS: There is a forecasted shortage of PNPs in the workforce over
   the next 13 years. Under the best-case scenario, it would take at least
   13 years for the workforce to fully satisfy demand. Our analysis of
   potential policy changes revealed that increasing the specialization
   rate for PNPs by 4\% would decrease the number of years required until
   there are enough PNPs from 13 years to 5 years. Increasing the
   certification examination passing rate to 96\% from the current average
   of 86.9\% would lead to self-sufficiency in 11 years. In addition,
   increasing the annual growth rate of master's programs to 36\% from the
   current maximum of 10.7\% would result in self-sufficiency in 5 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Current forecasts of demand for PNPs indicate that the
   current workforce will be incapable of satisfying the growing demand.
   Policy changes can result in a reduction in the expected shortage and
   potentially improve access to care for pediatric patients.}},

Abstract = {{A target was prepared for cyclic neutron activation analysis by heat
   sealing lithium-carbonate in polyethylene. The target was cyclically
   irradiated 50 times using a Thermo-Scientific accelerator based
   deuterium-tritium fusion neutron generator. During counting periods,
   gamma-rays emitted by N-16 were detected using three high-purity
   germanium detectors acquiring data in list-mode. Total counts acquired
   in each spectrum were compared between the three detectors to examine
   variability in geometric positioning of the target and variability of
   the generator intensity throughout the experiment. These two effects
   were determined to be the primary sources of variation in the measured
   counts. Variation in target positioning and generator intensity were
   found to increase the standard deviation by 34\% and 33\%, respectively.
   Transit times to the detector were found to be slower and more variable
   than transit to the generator but were well below the half second
   threshold needed to measure short-lived radionuclides with half-lives on
   the order of seconds. The standard deviation in irradiation time was
   found to be less than 1 milliseconds. The impact on statistical
   variability in the measured counts was negligible relative to the two
   primary sources of variation. Spectra acquired from each cycle were
   summed together. The sum of the peak areas from the 6.1 MeV gamma-ray
   and its corresponding single and double escape peaks were used to
   measure the half-life of N-16. The result of 7.108(15) seconds derived
   from data suggests that the currently published value of 7.13(2) seconds
   has minimal systematic bias induced by background. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper describes the formation of giant proteoliposomes containing
   P-glycoprotein (P-gp) from a solution of small proteoliposomes that had
   been deposited and partially dried on a film of agarose. This
   preparation method generated a significant fraction of giant
   proteoliposomes that were free of internalized vesicles, making it
   possible to determine the accessible liposome volume. Measuring the
   intensity of the fluorescent substrate rhodamine 123 (Rho123) inside and
   outside these giant proteoliposomes determined the concentration of
   transported substrates of P-gp. Fitting a kinetic model to the
   fluorescence data revealed the rate of passive diffusion as well as
   active transport by reconstituted P-gp in the membrane. This approach
   determined estimates for the membrane permeability coefficient (P-s) of
   passive diffusion and rate constants of active transport (k(T)) by P-gp
   as a result of different experimental conditions. The P-s value for
   Rho123 was larger in membranes containing P-gp under all assay
   conditions than in membranes without P-gp indicating increased leakiness
   in the presence of reconstituted transmembrane proteins. For P-gp
   liposomes, the k(T) value was significantly higher in the presence of
   ATP than in its absence or in the presence of ATP and the competitive
   inhibitor verapamil. This difference in k(T) values verified that P-gp
   was functionally active after reconstitution and quantified the rate of
   active transport. Lastly, patch clamp experiments on giant
   proteoliposomes showed ion channel activity consistent with a chloride
   ion channel protein that co-purified with P-gp. Together, these results
   demonstrate several advantages of using giant rather than small
   proteoliposomes to characterize transport properties of transport
   proteins and ion channels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Intermittent high intensity ultrasound pulses with circulating contrast
   agent microbubbles can induce scattered cavitation caused myocardial
   microlesions of potential value for tissue reduction therapy. Here,
   computer-aided histological evaluation of the effective treated volume
   was implemented to optimize ultrasound pulse parameters, exposure
   duration, and contrast agent dose. Rats were treated with 1.5 MHz
   focused ultrasound bursts and Evans blue staining indicates lethal
   cardiomyocytic injury. Each heart was sectioned to provide samples
   covering the entire exposed myocardial volume. Both brightfield and
   fluorescence images were taken for up to 40 tissue sections. Tissue
   identification and microlesion detection were first done based on 2-D
   images to form microlesion masks containing the outline of the heart and
   the stained cell regions. Image registration was then performed on the
   microlesion masks to reconstruct a volume-based model according to the
   morphology of the heart. The therapeutic beam path was estimated from
   the 3-D stacked microlesions, and finally the total microlesion volume,
   here termed macrolesion, was characterized along the therapeutic beam
   axis. Radially symmetric fractional macrolesions were characterized via
   stepping disks of variable radius determined by the local distribution
   of microlesions. Treated groups showed significant macrolesions of a
   median volume of 87.3 mu L, 2.7 mm radius, 4.8 mm length, and 14.0\%
   lesion density compared to zero radius, length, and lesion density for
   sham. The proposed radially symmetric lesion model is a robust
   evaluation for myocardial cavitation-enabled therapy. Future work will
   include validating the proposed method with varying acoustic exposures
   and optimizing involved parameters to provide macrolesion
   characterization.}},

Abstract = {{A finite strain nonlinear viscoplastic constitutive model for
   polyurethane (PU)-Montmorillonite clay (MTM) nanocomposites is developed
   with the goal of characterizing the mechanical response under different
   strain rates and strain amplitudes. In this model, both the elastic and
   viscous responses are considered to be nonlinear. It is shown that a
   simple mathematical extension of the model used to characterize the PU
   determines the nonlinear material constants for the PU-MTM. A finite
   deformation nonlinear viscoelastic model is used to represent the
   mechanical behavior of PU. The rate dependent viscous behavior and
   multiple relaxation times present in the PU response are determined
   using the frequency dependent tan delta measurements from Dynamic
   Mechanical Analysis (DMA). The model is capable of accurately capturing
   both the rate dependent behavior and frequency dependent damping of PU.
   The entire rate dependent hysteresis behavior (loading-unloading) is
   predicted accurately through the constitutive model for strains up to
   10\%. For the PU-MTM nanocomposite, the constitutive stress update is
   implemented in a finite element (ABAQUS/Explicit) framework and
   validated using a range of experimental results. The model predictions
   show excellent agreement with experimental results in capturing rate
   dependent loading/unloading responses for both PU and PU-MTM
   nanocomposites. The proposed model can easily be extended to
   characterize other polyurethane based nanocomposites. Published by

Abstract = {{Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable collagen-related bone
   dysplasia, characterized by brittle bones with increased fracture risk

   are frequently used to treat pediatric OI and controlled clinical trials

   has little benefit on long bone fracture rate. New treatments which
   increase bone mass throughout the pediatric OI skeleton would be
   beneficial. Sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) is a potential candidate
   anabolic therapy for pediatric OI and functions by stimulating
   osteoblastic bone formation via the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. To
   explore the effect of Scl-Ab on the rapidly growing OI skeleton, we
   treated rapidly growing 3 week old Brtl/+ mice, harboring a typical
   heterozygous OI-causing Gly --> Cys substitution on col1a1, for 5 weeks
   with Scl-Ab. Scl-Ab had anabolic effects in Brtl/+ and led to new
   cortical bone formation and increased cortical bone mass. This anabolic
   action resulted in improved mechanical strength to WTVeh levels without
   altering the underlying brittle nature of the material. While Scl-Ab was
   anabolic in trabecular bone of the distal femur in both genotypes, the
   effect was less strong in these rapidly growing Brtl/+ mice compared to
   WT. In conclusion, Scl-Ab was able to stimulate bone formation in a
   rapidly growing Brtl/+ murine model of OI, and represents a potential
   new therapy to improve bone mass and reduce fracture risk in pediatric
   OI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   rating were tracked to estimate S, scaled relative to hand breadth (HB),
   and single-frame analysis was used to measure D. Since HBs were unknown,
   a Monte Carlo method was employed for iteratively estimating the
   regression coefficients from US Army anthropometry survey data. The
   equation: , R-2 = 0.97, had a residual range +/- 0.5 HAL. The S equation

Abstract = {{Conventional recuperating solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)/gas turbine (GT)
   system suffers from its poor dynamic capability and load following
   performance. To meet the fast, safe and efficient load following
   requirements for mobile applications, a sprinter SOFC/GT system concept
   is proposed in this paper. In the proposed system, an SOFC stack
   operating at fairly constant temperature provides the baseline power
   with high efficiency while the fast dynamic capability of the
   GT-generator is fully explored for fast dynamic load following. System
   design and control studies have been conducted by using an SOFC/GT
   system model consisting of experimentally-verified component models. In
   particular, through analysis of the steady-state simulation results, an
   SOFC operation strategy is proposed to maintain fairly constant SOFC
   power (less than 2\% power variation) and temperature (less than 2 K
   temperature variation) over the entire load range. A system design
   procedure well-suited to the proposed system has also been developed to
   help determining component sizes and the reference steady-state
   operation line. In addition, control analysis has been studied for both
   steady-state and transient operations. Simulation results suggest that
   the proposed system holds the promise to achieve fast and safe transient
   operations by taking full advantage of the fast dynamics of the
   GT-generator. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of surface oxygen on the physical and electrochemical
   properties of high surface area Mo, V and W carbides and nitrides has
   been investigated. These materials hold promise for use in
   supercapacitors and other electrochemical conversion devices. The
   carbides and nitrides were synthesized using a temperature programmed
   reaction method and passivated to avoid bulk oxidation on exposure to
   air. The passivated materials were activated in 0.3 mol dm(-3) NaOH
   solution to remove the oxygen-rich passivation layer. This activation
   resulted in significant changes in the electrochemical stabilities and
   capacitances. The surface areas for the Mo and W-based materials were
   higher after activation, with the effect ranging from an 11\% increase
   for Mo2N to a 208\% increase for W2C. An increase in pore volume and
   mesopore density was also observed for most of the materials.
   Interestingly, the VC and W2C, which were electrochemically unstable in
   acidic electrolyte in their passivated form, were stable after
   activation. The capacitances of all of the materials were increased
   after activation with the effect ranging from 48\% for Mo2N to a 79\%
   increase for (alpha + beta)-Mo2C. This activation process could be used
   to improve the performance of carbide and nitride-based supercapacitor
   electrode materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the mechanisms of penetration induced thermal
   runaway (TR) propagation process within a large format lithium ion
   battery pack. A 6-battery module is built with 47 thermocouples
   installed at critical positions to record the temperature profiles. The
   first battery of the module is penetrated to trigger a TR propagation
   process. The temperature responses, the voltage responses and the heat
   transfer through different paths are analyzed and discussed to
   characterize the underlying physical behavior. The temperature responses
   show that: 1) Compared with the results of TR tests using accelerating
   rate calorimetry (ARC) with uniform heating, a lower onset temperature
   and a shorter TR triggering time are observed in a penetration induced
   TR propagation test due to side heating. 2) The maximum temperature
   difference within a battery can be as high as 791.8 degrees C in a
   penetration induced TR propagation test. The voltage responses have a
   5-stage feature, indicating that the TR happens in sequence for the two
   pouch cells packed inside a battery. The heat transfer analysis shows
   that: 1) 12\% of the total heat released in TR of a battery is enough to
   trigger the adjacent battery to TR. 2) The heat transferred through the
   pole connector is only about 1/10 of that through the battery shell. 3)
   The fire has little influence on the TR propagation, but may cause
   significant damage on the accessories located above the battery. The
   results can enhance our understandings of the mechanisms of TR
   propagation, and provide important guidelines in pack design for large
   format lithium ion battery. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hollow structural sections (HSS) are currently underutilized in seismic
   moment frame systems as possible alternatives to typical wide-flange
   members. To explore the potential use of HSS moment connections in
   seismic moment frame systems and evaluate connection detailing
   requirements, experimental tests of welded unreinforced and reinforced
   HSS-to-HSS connections are conducted under increasing cyclic rotations
   to failure. The behavior of the unreinforced connections is limited by
   their inability to isolate inelasticity to the beam member and panel
   zone region leading to eventual fracture at lower than anticipated drift
   levels. However, through plate and external diaphragm plate reinforced
   HSS-to-HSS moment connections are able to move the location of
   inelasticity into the HSS beam member resulting in desired beam plastic
   hinging. Although the unreinforced connections have limited ductility,
   the reinforced connection detailing leads to stable degradation of the
   moment capacity at increasing drift levels with fracture initiating only
   at very large rotations attributable to eventual onset of local buckling
   in the plastic hinge region. The through and diaphragm plates are found
   to have an important effect in ensuring that the sources of inelastic
   rotation are limited to the beam and panel zone region. Additionally,
   the use of reinforcement improves the connection stiffness. Overall, the
   study shows that fully welded HSS-to-HSS seismic moment connections are
   viable provided proper detailing of the connection is performed. (C)

Abstract = {{PurposeTo determine whether a recently proposed steady-state magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) sequence, small-tip fast recovery (STFR), can be
   used for functional brain imaging. Compared to existing functional MRI
   (fMRI) based on <mml:msubsup>T2{*}</mml:msubsup>-contrast and long echo
   time, STFR has the potential for high-resolution imaging with reduced
   B-0 artifacts such as geometric distortions, blurring, or local signal
   dropout.
   MethodsWe used Monte Carlo Bloch simulations to calculate the
   voxel-averaged steady-state signal during rest and activation, for blood
   oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and STFR. STFR relies on a tailored tip-up
   radiofrequency pulse to align the spins with the longitudinal axis after
   each data readout segment, and here we performed proof-of-concept in
   vivo STFR fMRI experiments using a tip-up pulse tailored to a
   two-dimensional region-of-interest in motor cortex. Experiments were
   performed on multiple subjects to test reliability of the functional
   activation maps.
   ResultsBloch simulations predict a detectable functional signal that
   depends mainly on intravoxel dephasing, and only weakly on spin
   diffusion. STFR produces similar activation maps and signal change as
   BOLD in finger-tapping experiments, and shows reliability comparable to
   BOLD.
   ConclusionSTFR can produce functional contrast (even with short TE), and
   is a potential alternative to long-TE (
   <mml:msubsup>T2{*}</mml:msubsup>) fMRI. The functional contrast arises
   primarily from the interaction between
   <mml:msubsup>T2{*}</mml:msubsup>-like dephasing and the tailored tip-up
   pulse, and not from spin diffusion. Magn Reson Med 73:536-543, 2015. (c)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we reflect on current notions of engineering practice by
   examining some of the motives for engineered solutions to the problem of
   climate change. We draw on fields such as science and technology
   studies, the philosophy of technology, and environmental ethics to
   highlight how dominant notions of apoliticism and ahistoricity are
   ingrained in contemporary engineering practice. We argue that a solely
   technological response to climate change does not question the social,
   political, and cultural tenet of infinite material growth, one of the
   root causes of climate change. In response to the contemporary
   engineering practice, we define an activist engineer as someone who not
   only can provide specific engineered solutions, but who also steps back
   from their work and tackles the question, What is the real problem and
   does this problem ``require{''} an engineering intervention? Solving
   complex problems like climate change requires radical cultural change,
   and a significant obstacle is educating engineers about how to conceive
   of and create ``authentic alternatives,{''} that is, solutions that
   differ from the paradigm of ``technologically improving{''} our way out
   of problems. As a means to realize radically new solutions, we
   investigate how engineers might (re)deploy the concept of praxis, which
   raises awareness in engineers of the inherent politics of technological
   design. Praxis empowers engineers with a more comprehensive
   understanding of problems, and thus transforms technologies, when
   appropriate, into more socially just and ecologically sensitive
   interventions. Most importantly, praxis also raises a radical
   alternative rarely considered-not ``engineering a solution.{''} Activist
   engineering offers a contrasting method to contemporary engineering
   practice and leads toward social justice and ecological protection
   through problem solving by asking not, How will we technologize our way
   out of the problems we face? but instead, What really needs to be done?.}},

Title = {{Competition between Metals for Binding to Methanobactin Enables
   Expression of Soluble Methane Monooxygenase in the Presence of Copper}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that copper is a key factor regulating expression of
   the two forms of methane monooxygenase found in proteobacterial
   methanotrophs. Of these forms, the cytoplasmic, or soluble, methane
   monooxygenase (sMMO) is expressed only at low copper concentrations. The
   membrane-bound, or particulate, methane monooxygenase (pMMO) is
   constitutively expressed with respect to copper, and such expression
   increases with increasing copper. Recent findings have shown that copper
   uptake is mediated by a modified polypeptide, or chalkophore, termed
   methanobactin. Although methanobactin has high specificity for copper,
   it can bind other metals, e.g., gold. Here we show that in Methylosinus
   trichosporium OB3b, sMMO is expressed and active in the presence of
   copper if gold is also simultaneously present. Such expression appears
   to be due to gold binding to methanobactin produced by M. trichosporium
   OB3b, thereby limiting copper uptake. Such expression and activity,
   however, was significantly reduced if methanobactin preloaded with
   copper was also added. Further, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
   (RTqPCR) of transcripts of genes encoding polypeptides of both forms of
   MMO and SDS-PAGE results indicate that both sMMO and pMMO can be
   expressed when copper and gold are present, as gold effectively competes
   with copper for binding to methanobactin. Such findings suggest that
   under certain geochemical conditions, both forms of MMO may be expressed
   and active in situ. Finally, these findings also suggest strategies
   whereby field sites can be manipulated to enhance sMMO expression, i.e.,
   through the addition of a metal that can compete with copper for binding
   to methanobactin.}},

Title = {{Comparative analysis of dental implant treatment outcomes following
   mandibular reconstruction with double-barrel fibula bone grafting or

Journal = {{CLINICAL ORAL IMPLANTS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{157-165}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{PurposeThe purpose of this study was twofold: (i) to compare vertical
   bone height (VBH) after tumor resection through grafting with either a
   double-barrel fibula (DBF) technique or vertical distraction
   osteogenesis of the fibula (VDOF); (ii) to compare the performance of
   loaded dental implants following either DBF or VDOF with special focus
   on implant survival, implant success, and bone resorption.
   Materials and methodsThis retrospective clinical study involved 19
   patients who underwent implant placement following DBF (group A, n=9) or
   VDOF (group B, n=10) for mandibular reconstruction from March 2006 to
   May 2008. Clinical and radiographic assessments, including VBH, modified
   Plaque Index (mPI), modified Sulcus Bleeding Index (mSBI), and marginal
   bone level (MBL), were taken for both groups after delivery of the final
   prostheses and annually thereafter.
   ResultsNine patients underwent DBF with 24 implants placed and 10
   patients underwent VDOF with 27 implants placed for mandibular
   reconstruction after tumor resection. Overall, all DBF and VDOF
   procedures were successful for group A and group B. VBH for group A and
   group B were 20 and 17mm. There was no statistically significant
   difference of mSBI scores between group A and group B in the 3-year
   follow-up (P=0.40). In four cases with eight implants of group A and two
   cases with three implants of group B, granulomatous soft tissue grew.
   There was no statistically significant differences of MBL between group
   A and group B in the 3-year follow-up (p=0.736). The cumulative survival
   and success rates of implants for group A were 100\% and 87.5\%, and for
   group B were 100\% and 85.2\% in 3-year follow-up, respectively.
   ConclusionsOn the basis of the study of 19 patients who received a total
   of 51 implants, reconstruction of the mandible with DBF flap or VDOF
   flap, combined with dental implant therapy, was considered a predictable
   option. Compared with implants placed in VDOF bone, implants placed in
   DBF bone had a relative higher incidence of associated gingival
   inflammation. The DBF bone seems more resistant to peri-implant
   resorption processes than VDOF bone during functional loading.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric materials, such as lead zirconate titanate, display high
   electromechanical coupling, low internal losses, and exceptional
   environmental durability making them the material of choice for acoustic
   imaging transducers. Traditionally, piezoelectric transducers are
   actuated in the thickness-extension mode and they often make use of
   matching films to improve the signal transmissibility into lower
   acoustic impedance targets. In this article, we propose the use of
   transducers coupled to a structure in a direction orthogonal to the
   resonating plane. An analytical solution for the electromechanical
   behavior of a piezoelectric plate coupled transversely is derived. The
   analytical model shows that when resonated transversely, a transducer
   could display significantly lower effective acoustic impedance compared
   to transducers actuated in the thickness-extension mode. This feature
   eliminates the need for the matching films, hence helping reducing
   manufacturing costs. General guidelines on how to optimize the design of
   the proposed transducer for impedance imaging are also given. Finally,
   this article shows one example of how using a lead zirconate titanate
   transducer resonated transversely can reliably detect matrix cracking in
   fiberglass composite plates.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical algorithm is described in which changes of geometry caused
   by wear can be simulated by ascribing fictitious anisotropic
   eigenstrains to a set of surface nodes. These eigenstrains are related
   to the wear depth at any location, and can be incorporated into
   calculations using the existing expansion modules in commercial codes,
   such as anisotropic swelling or thermal expansion. The proposed
   algorithm has been implemented, and the results compared to those from a
   conventional wear model involving periodic re-meshing. It has been shown

Abstract = {{To gain better understanding of the detailed mechanisms of
   high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for cardiac
   arrhythmias, we investigated how the cellular electrophysiological (EP)
   changes were correlated with temperature increases and thermal dose
   (cumulative equivalent minutes {[}CEM43]) during HIFU application using
   Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. Employing voltage-sensitive dye
   di-4-ANEPPS, we measured the EP and temperature during HIFU using
   simultaneous optical mapping and infrared imaging. Both action potential
   amplitude (APA) and action potential duration at 50\% repolarization
   (APD(50)) decreased with temperature increases, and APD(50) was more
   thermally sensitive than APA. EP and tissue changes were irreversible
   when HIFU-induced temperature increased above 52.3 +/- 1.4 degrees C and
   log(10)(CEM43) above 2.16 +/- 0.51 (n = 5), but were reversible when
   temperature was below 50.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C and log(10)(CEM43) below
   -0.9 +/- 0.3 (n = 9). EP and temperature/thermal dose changes were

Title = {{On the role of subspace zeros in retrospective cost adaptive control of
   non-square plants}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL}},

Abstract = {{We consider adaptive control of non-square plants, that is, plants that
   have an unequal number of inputs and outputs. In particular, we focus on
   retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC), which is a direct,
   discrete-time adaptive control algorithm that is applicable to
   stabilisation, command following, disturbance rejection, and model
   reference control problems. Previous studies on RCAC have focused on
   control of square plants. In the square case, RCAC requires knowledge of
   the first non-zero Markov parameter and the non-minimum-phase (NMP)
   transmission zeros of the plant, if any. No additional information about
   the plant or the exogenous signals need be known. The goal of the
   present paper is to consider RCAC for non-square plants. Unlike the
   square case, we show that the assumption that the non-square plant is
   minimum phase does not guarantee closed-loop stability and signal
   boundedness. The main purpose of this paper is to establish the
   existence of time-invariant input and output subspaces corresponding to
   the adaptive controller. In particular, we show that RCAC implicitly
   squares down non-square plants through pre-/post-compensation of the
   non-square plant with a constant matrix. We show that, for wide plants,
   the control input generated by RCAC lies in a time-invariant `input
   subspace', which is equivalent to pre-compensating the plant with a
   constant matrix. On the other hand, for tall plants, we show that the
   controller update is driven by the output of the plant post-compensated
   with a constant matrix. Accordingly, in either case, signal boundedness
   properties of the closed-loop system are determined by the transmission
   zeros of the squared system, which we call the `subspace zeros'. To deal
   with NMP subspace zeros, we introduce a robustness modification, which
   prevents RCAC from cancelling the NMP subspace zeros.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, polymeric membrane based hemodialysis is considered to be the
   most practical approach for the treatment of kidney failure. To develop
   advanced hemodialysis membrane integrated with favorable blood and cell
   compatibilities and efficient blood purification ability, novel
   biocompatible composite membranes consisting of heparin-mimicking
   polymer brush functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) and
   polyethersulfone (PES) are designed. Firstly, surface initiated atom
   transfer polymerization (SI-ATRP) is applied to synthesize
   heparin-mimicking polymer brush (contained the sodium styrene sullonate
   (SS) and methyl ether methacrylate (EGMA) units) grafted CNT. Then, the
   f-CNT/PES composite membranes are prepared by a liquid-liquid phase
   separation technique. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) results indicated that the f-CNT would not cause
   severe damage on the membrane morphologies. Systemic protein
   ultrafiltration experiment indicated that the heparin-mimicking
   composite membranes owned satisfied antifouling property and protein
   rejection ratio. Further blood compatibility evaluation revealed that
   the composite membranes had decreased protein adsorption, prolonged
   clotting time, and suppressed platelet adhesion compared to pristine PES
   membrane. The results of human embryonic hepatocytes (LO-2) culture
   revealed that the cyto-compatibility of the modified membrane was
   enhanced by the blending of heparin mimicking polymer functionalized
   CNT. Furthermore, with the addition of f-CNT, the composite membranes
   showed remarkably increased removal efficiency of uremic toxin. In
   general, the fabricated heparin-mimicking f-CNT/PES composite membranes
   exhibited anti-fouling ability in ultrafiltration, excellent blood and
   cell compatibility and efficient toxic molecules removal ratio, thus
   present great potential for various applications, such as hemodialysis
   and bio-artificial liver support. Furthermore, the proposed method might
   forward the fabrication of advanced hemodialysis membrane by integrating
   functional nanomaterials and bioactive polymers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Thermal aging characteristics of model automotive Pd/Al2O3 catalyst
   materials were examined under simulated aging and light-off conditions
   as a function of aging temperature (up to 1000 degrees C) in both
   reducing and oxidizing gas mixtures, and in the presence and absence of
   steam. the catalysts were characterized by static H-2 chemisorption,
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and
   both CO as well as propylene light-off experiments. Aging-induced
   changes in the Al2O3 support were modest and limited to slight loss of
   BET area and transition from predominantly gamma-phase (as received) to
   theta-phase (after 1000 degrees C aging). The main deactivation mode of
   aging was loss of Pd surface area via metallic Pd sintering, especially
   above the PdO decomposition temperature, as evidenced by higher
   light-off temperatures. Aging gas composition also impacted the Pd
   particle size, with more pronounced growth in rich gas (H-2) mixtures.
   In contrast, particle growth was minimal in lean (O-2) gas mixtures
   below the PdO decomposition temperature, and sintered Pd particles could
   be modestly re-dispersed by treating below the PdO decomposition
   temperatures in O-2 and in the absence of steam. The study suggests
   strategies for operating vehicles in ways that mitigate or reverse aging
   effects related to Pd particle growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   brought new challenges for multi-unit maintenance decision-making. The
   maintenance scheduling should not only consider individual machine
   deterioration, but also apply to batch production with variable lot
   size. An interactive bi-level maintenance strategy is thus proposed in a
   multi-unit batch production system with degrading machines. In the
   machine-level scheduling, a multi-attribute model (MAM) is used to
   obtain maintenance intervals according to individual machine
   degradation. In the system-level scheduling, a novel production-driven
   opportunistic maintenance strategy is developed by considering both
   machine degradation and characteristics of batch production. In this
   strategy, advance-postpone balancing (APB) utilizes set-up times as
   opportunities to make real-time schedules for system-level maintenance.
   The numerical example shows that the proposed MAM-APB methodology can
   efficiently eliminate unnecessary production breaks, achieve significant
   cost reduction and overcome complexity of system scheduling. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Hydrophobic particles in water and hydrophilic particles in oil
   aggregate, but can form colloidal dispersions if their surfaces are
   chemically camouflaged with surfactants, organic tethers, adsorbed
   polymers or other particles that impart affinity for the solvent and
   increase interparticle repulsion(1,2). A different strategy for
   modulating the interaction between a solid and a liquid uses surface
   corrugation, which gives rise to unique wetting behaviour(3-5). Here we
   show that this topographical effect can also be used to disperse
   particles in a wide range of solvents without recourse to chemicals to
   camouflage the particles' surfaces: we produce micrometre-sized
   particles that are coated with stiff, nanoscale spikes and exhibit
   long-term colloidal stability in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic media.
   We find that these `hedgehog' particles do not interpenetrate each other
   with their spikes, which markedly decreases the contact area between the
   particles and, therefore, the attractive forces between them. The
   trapping of air in aqueous dispersions, solvent autoionization at highly
   developed interfaces, and long-range electrostatic repulsion in organic
   media also contribute to the colloidal stability of our particles. The
   unusual dispersion behaviour of our hedgehog particles, overturning the
   notion that like dissolves like, might help to mitigate adverse
   environmental effects of the use of surfactants and volatile organic
   solvents, and deepens our understanding of interparticle interactions
   and nanoscale colloidal chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental, time-resolved species profiles provide critical tests in
   developing accurate combustion models for biofuels such as n-butanol. A
   number of such species profiles measured by Karwat et al. {[}Karwat, D.
   M. A.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 2011, 115, 4909] were discordant with
   predictions from a well-tested chemical kinetic mechanism developed by
   Black et al. {[}Black, G.; et al. Combust. Flame 2010, 157, 363]. Since
   then, significant theoretical and experimental efforts have focused on
   determining the rate coefficients of primary n-butanol consumption
   pathways in combustion environments, including H atom abstraction
   reactions from n-butanol by key radicals such as HO2 and OH, as well as
   the decomposition of the radicals formed by these H atom abstractions.
   These reactions not only determine the overall reactivity of n-butanol,
   but also significantly affect the concentrations of intermediate species
   formed during n-butanol ignition. In this paper we explore the effect of
   incorporating new ab initio predictions into the Black et al. mechanism
   on predictions of ignition delay time and species time histories for the
   experimental conditions studied by Karwat et al. The revised predictions
   for the intermediate species time histories are in much improved
   agreement with the measurements, but some discrepancies persist. A rate
   of production analysis comparing the effects of various modifications to
   the Black et al. mechanism shows significant changes in the predicted
   consumption pathways of n-butanol, and of the hydroxybutyl and butoxy
   radicals formed by H atom abstraction from n-butanol. The predictions
   from the newly revised mechanism are in very good agreement with the
   low-pressure n-butanol pyrolysis product species measurements of Stranic
   et al. {[}Stranic, I.; et al. Combust. Flame 2012, 159, 3242] for all
   but one species. Importantly, the changes to the Black et al. mechanism
   show that concentrations of small products from n-butanol pyrolysis are
   sensitive to different reactions than those presented by Stranic et al.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In plasma materials processing, such as plasma etching, control of the
   time-averaged electron energy distributions (EEDs) in the plasma allows
   for control of the time-averaged electron impact source functions of
   reactive species in the plasma and their fluxes to surfaces. One
   potential method for refining the control of EEDs is through the use of
   pulsed power. Inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs) are attractive for
   using pulsed power in this manner because the EEDs are dominantly
   controlled by the ICP power as opposed to the bias power applied to the
   substrate. In this paper, we discuss results from a computational
   investigation of EEDs and electron impact source functions in low
   pressure (5-50 mTorr) ICPs sustained in Ar/N-2 for various duty cycles.
   We find there is an ability to control EEDs, and thus source functions,
   by pulsing the ICP power, with the greatest variability of the EEDs
   located within the skin depth of the electromagnetic field. The transit
   time of hot electrons produced in the skin depth at the onset of pulse
   power produces a delay in the response of the EEDs as a function of
   distance from the coils. The choice of ICP pressure has a large impact
   on the dynamics of the EEDs, whereas duty cycle has a small influence on
   time-averaged EEDs and source functions. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Structural and dynamical properties of star melts have been investigated
   with molecular dynamics simulations of a bead-spring model. Star
   polymers are known to be heterogeneous, but a systematic simulation
   study of their properties in melt conditions near the glass transition
   temperature was lacking. To probe their properties, we have expanded
   from linear to star polymers the applicability of Dobkowski's
   chain-length dependence correlation function {[}Z. Dobkowski, Eur.
   Polym. J. 18, 563 (1982)]. The density and the isokinetic temperature,
   based on the canonical definition of the laboratory glass-transition,
   can be described well by the correlation function and a subtle behavior
   manifests as the architecture becomes more complex. For linear polymer
   chains and low functionality star polymers, we find that an increase of
   the arm length would result in an increase of the density and the
   isokinetic temperature, but high functionality star polymers have the
   opposite behavior. The effect between low and high functionalities is
   more pronounced for short arm lengths. Complementary results such as the
   specific volume and number of neighbors in contact provide further
   insights on the subtle relation between structure and dynamics. The
   findings would be valuable to polymer, colloidal, and nanocomposites
   fields for the design of materials in absence of solution with the
   desired properties. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Relationship between Polyelectrolyte Bulk Complexation and Kinetics of

Journal = {{MACROMOLECULES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{400-409}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{The effects of pH and salinity on both the bulk phase behavior and the
   layer-by-layer (LbL) growth kinetics are investigated for polyanion
   poly(acrylic acid) or PAA with two polycations, namely
   poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) or PDMAEMA and
   poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) or PDADMAC, with the goal of
   relating the phase behavior to the LbL growth kinetics. Depending on
   salinity, pH, and mixing ratio, the complex formed in the bulk is either
   a powdery precipitate or a gel-like coacervate, and the multilayers grow
   either linearly or exponentially with deposition time. In addition to
   primary Coulombic interactions, we observe that polymer-specific
   interactions have a profound effect on both bulk complexation and LbL
   growth of the three PE pairs studied here. The overall strength of
   interaction between polyelectrolytes, as indicated by their phase
   behavior, has a nonmonotonic effect on LbL growth rate, apparently
   because stronger interactions not only increase the driving force for
   diffusion but also reduce the effective diffusion coefficient of a
   polyelectrolyte molecule through the LbL multilayer. As a result, there
   is little correspondence between coacervation and exponential growth on
   one hand and precipitation and linear growth on the other. Salt
   concentration has a nonmonotonic effect on LbL growth kinetics at pH 7,
   with exponential growth found over the range 15-60\% of the critical
   salt concentration (C-S(c)) needed to transition from coacervation to a
   clear solution in the bulk, regardless of the physical chemistry of
   polyelectrolytes employed, whereas salt concentrations both below and
   above this range result in linearly growing films. Finally, for our
   polyelectrolyte pairs at pH 7, we report a universal curve for the
   dependence of LbL growth rate, normalized by its maximum value, against
   the salt concentration, normalized by C-S(c). If it proves to be robust,
   this correlation could be used to estimate optimal salinity for LbL
   growth from bulk measurements of the critical salt concentration needed
   to suppress complexation.}},

Abstract = {{The external quantum efficiency of white organic light-emitting diodes
   is often limited by light out-coupling losses due to surface plasmons.
   We demonstrate how texturing of the metal-cathode surface using a
   two-dimensionally periodic lattice of nanoscale scatterers with limited
   disorder can be used to reduce plasmonic losses while simultaneously
   enhancing both the light out-coupling and the spontaneous-emission rate
   of the excitons. We use electrodynamic simulations and statistical
   modeling to explore the relationship between the topology of the surface
   texture and its corresponding scattering efficiency. From this, we
   outline attributes of textures that can most enhance device performance.

Abstract = {{We lack a clear understanding of how wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)
   process parameters, such as redox environment, impact pharmaceutical
   fate. WWTPs increasingly install more advanced aeration control systems
   to save energy and achieve better nutrient removal performance. The
   impact of redox condition, and specifically the use of microaerobic (low
   dissolved oxygen) treatment, is poorly understood. In this study, the
   fate of a mixture of pharmaceuticals and several of their transformation
   products present in the primary effluent of a local WWTP was assessed in
   sequencing batch reactors operated under different redox conditions:
   fully aerobic, anoxic/aerobic, and microaerobic (DO concentration,
   approximate to 0.3 mg/L). Among the pharmaceuticals that were tracked
   during this study (atenolol, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole,
   desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, and phenytoin), overall loss varied between
   them and between redox environments. Losses of atenolol and trimethoprim
   were highest in the aerobic reactor; sulfamethoxazole loss was highest
   in the microaerobic reactors; and phenytoin was recalcitrant in all
   reactors. Transformation products of sulfamethoxazole and desvenlafaxine
   resulted in the reformation of their parent compounds during treatment.
   The results suggest that transformation products must be accounted for
   when assessing removal efficiencies and that redox environment
   influences the degree of pharmaceutical loss. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The discovery of n-type ferromagnetic semiconductors (n-FMSs) exhibiting
   high electrical conductivity and Curie temperature (T-c) above 300 K
   would dramatically improve semiconductor spintronics and pave the way
   for the fabrication of spin-based semiconducting devices. However, the
   realization of high-T-c n-FMSs and p-FMSs in conventional high-symmetry
   semiconductors has proven extremely difficult due to the strongly
   coupled and interacting magnetic and semiconducting sublattices. Here we
   show that decoupling the two functional sublattices in the low-symmetry
   semiconductor FeBi2Se4 enables unprecedented coexistence of high n-type
   electrical conduction and ferromagnetism with T-c approximate to 450 K.
   The structure of FeBi2Se4 consists of well-ordered magnetic sublattices
   built of {[}FenSe4n+2](8) single-chain edge-sharing octahedra,
   coherently embedded within the three-dimensional Bi-rich semiconducting
   framework. Magnetotransport data reveal a negative magnetoresistance,
   indicating spin-polarization of itinerant conducting electrons. These
   findings demonstrate that decoupling magnetic and semiconducting
   sublattices allows access to high-T-c n- and p-FMSs as well as helps
   unveil the mechanism of carrier-mediated ferromagnetism in spintronic
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{Injectable microspheres are attractive stem cell carriers for minimally
   invasive procedures. For tissue regeneration, the microspheres need to
   present the critical cues to properly direct stem cell differentiation.
   In natural extracellular matrix (ECM), growth factors (GFs) and collagen
   nanofi bers provide critical chemical and physical cues. However, there
   have been no reported technologies that integrate synthetic nanofi bers
   and GFs into injectable microspheres. In this study, functional nanofi
   brous hollow microspheres (FNF-HMS), which can covalently bind
   GF-mimicking peptides, are synthesized. Two different GF-mimicking
   peptides, Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1 mimicking peptide
   Cytomodulin (CM) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 mimicking peptide P24,
   are separately conjugated onto the FNF-HMS to induce distinct
   differentiation pathways of rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
   cells (BMSCs). While no existing biomaterials are reported to

Abstract = {{Iron sulfide precipitates formed under sulfate reducing conditions may
   buffer U(IV) insoluble solid phases from reoxidation after oxidants
   re-enter the reducing zone. In this study, sediment column experiments
   were performed to quantify the effect of biogenic mackinawite on U(IV)
   stability in the presence of nitrite or dissolved oxygen (DO). Two
   columns, packed with sediment from an abandoned U contaminated mill
   tailings site near Rifle, CO, were biostimulated for 62 days with an
   electron donor (3 mM acetate) in the presence (BRS+) and absence (BRS-)
   of 7 mM sulfate. The bioreduced sediment was supplemented with synthetic
   uraninite (UO2(s)), sterilized by gamma-irradiation, and then subjected
   to a sequential oxidation by nitrite and DO. Biogenic iron sulfides
   produced in the BRS+ column, mostly as mackinawite, inhibited U(IV)
   reoxidation and mobilization by both nitrite and oxygen. Most of the
   influent nitrite (0.53 mM) exited the columns without oxidizing UO2,
   while a small amount of nitrite was consumed by iron sulfides
   precipitates. An additional 10-day supply of 0.25 mM DO influent
   resulted in the release of about 10\% and 49\% of total U in BRS+ and
   BRS columns, respectively. Influent DO was effectively consumed by
   biogenic iron sulfides in the BRS+ column, while DO and a large U spike
   were detected after only a brief period in the effluent in the BRS
   column.}},

   Our simulations generate percolation-cluster perimeters with hull walks
   on a triangular lattice inside a hexagon. Each sample comprises two hull
   walks, and the order in which these walks strike the bottom and upper
   left/right sides of the hexagon determines the crossing configuration of
   the percolation sample. We compare our numerical results with the
   predicted crossing probabilities, finding excellent agreement.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing need to provide more realistic and accurate State of
   Health estimations for batteries in electric vehicles. Thus, it is
   necessary to research various lithium-ion cell aging processes,
   including cell degradation and related path dependence. This paper
   focuses on quantitative analyses of cell aging path dependence in a
   repeatable laboratory setting, considering the influence of duty cycles,
   depth of discharge (DOD), and the frequency and severity of the thermal
   cycle, as reflected in pure electric buses operated in Beijing.
   Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis
   (DVA) are applied to infer cell degradation mechanisms and quantify the
   attributions to capacity fade. It was observed that the cells
   experienced a higher rate of aging at 80\% DOD and an accelerated aging
   at 40 degrees C in the thermal cycling, as a result of possible loss of
   active material (LAM) in both electrodes, in addition to the loss of
   lithium inventory (LLI) and inhibited kinetics. The slight capacity fade
   from low-temperature extremes likely caused by LLI due to lithium
   plating, whereas the noticeable fade after the high-temperature
   excursion was likely caused by LAM and hindrance to kinetics. These
   results may lead to improved battery management in EV applications. (C)

Volume = {{274}},
Pages = {{400-411}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, four different semi-active hybrid energy storage systems
   (HESSs), which use both supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries, are
   compared based on an electric city bus running the China Bus Driving
   Cycle (CBDC). The SC sizes of the different HESS topologies are
   optimized by using the dynamic programming (DP) approach, based on a
   dynamic degradation model of the LiFePO4 battery. The operation costs of
   different HESSs, including the electricity and the battery degradation
   costs over a whole CBDC, are minimized in the optimization process.
   Based on the DP results, near-optimal control strategies of different
   HESSs for on-line uses are proposed. Finally, the four HESS topologies
   are comprehensively compared from different aspects, including operation
   cost, initial cost, and DC bus voltage variation. Simulation results
   show that all HESS topologies have their merits and drawbacks, and can
   be used in different applications with different requirements. In
   addition, about 50\% of the operation cost of the energy storage system
   is reduced by the semi-active HESSs when compared to the battery-only
   topology. Thus the effectiveness of adopting the SC in the HESS is
   verified. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional ultrasound imaging is a promising medical imaging
   technology because of its ease of use and improved accuracy in
   diagnosis. However, its high computational complexity and resulting high
   power consumption has precluded its use in hand-held applications. In
   this paper, we present a separable beamforming method that greatly
   reduces computational complexity. Our method is based on decomposing the
   delay term in a way that minimizes the root-mean-square error caused by
   the decomposition. We analyze tradeoffs between the approximation error
   caused by the decomposition and computational complexity. Then, we
   present enhancements to the Sonic Millip3De hardware accelerator for
   ultrasound beamforming to implement separable beamforming. Using
   hardware synthesis targeting standard cells in 45 nm, we show that the
   proposed method allows us to boost the Sonic Millip3De frame rate from
   1-2 Hz to 32 Hz while maintaining power consumption at 15 W. We validate
   image quality of our method using cyst phantom simulations in Field II.
   Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed separable beamforming
   method can produce 3-D images with high quality that are comparable to
   those generated by non-separable beamforming.}},

Title = {{Computational Modeling Predicts IL-10 Control of Lesion Sterilization by
   Balancing Early Host Immunity-Mediated Antimicrobial Responses with
   Caseation during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Although almost a third of the world's population is infected with the
   bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, our understanding of the
   functions of many immune factors involved in fighting infection is
   limited. Determining the role of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 at
   the level of the granuloma has proven difficult because of lesional
   heterogeneity and the limitations of animal models. In this study, we
   take an in silico approach and, through a series of virtual experiments,
   we predict several novel roles for IL-10 in tuberculosis granulomas: 1)
   decreased levels of IL-10 lead to increased numbers of sterile lesions,
   but at the cost of early increased caseation; 2) small increases in
   early antimicrobial activity cause this increased lesion sterility; 3)
   IL-10 produced by activated macrophages is a major mediator of early
   antimicrobial activity and early host-induced caseation; and 4)
   increasing levels of infected macrophage derived IL-10 promotes
   bacterial persistence by limiting the early antimicrobial response and
   preventing lesion sterilization. Our findings, currently only accessible
   using an in silico approach, suggest that IL-10 at the individual

Abstract = {{In this article, a computational procedure that automatically determines
   the optimum time step, cell weight and species weights for steady-state
   multi-species DSMC (direct simulation Monte Carlo) simulations is
   presented. The time step is required to satisfy the basic requirements
   of the DSMC method while the weight and relative weights fields are
   chosen so as to obtain a user-specified average number of particles in
   all cells of the domain. The procedure allows the conduct of efficient
   DSMC simulations with minimal user input and is integrable into existing
   DSMC codes. The adaptive method is used to simulate a test case
   consisting of two counterflowing jets at a Knudsen number of 0.015.
   Large accuracy gains for sampled number densities and velocities over a
   standard simulation approach for the same number of particles are

Abstract = {{Brownian dynamics simulations are performed to study the binding
   kinetics in the dilute-sphere limit by considering interactions of two
   spheres under shear flow across the entire range of Peclet numbers,
   spanning both perikinetic (diffusion-controlled) and orthokinetic
   (flow-controlled) coagulation regimes. The dilute regime is attained by
   carrying out two-sphere simulations in periodic boxes of different sizes
   and aspect ratios and extrapolating toward the infinite box limit.
   Effects of particle type (Janus and isotropic particles), shear rate,
   hydrodynamic interactions, and inter-particle potential are explored. We
   find that rectangular boxes with appropriate aspect ratios overcome a
   particle ``shadow effect{''} that cannot be overcome with cubic boxes
   unless huge boxes are used. With rectangular boxes, we obtain converged
   binding kinetics for the whole Peclet number range, while cubic boxes of
   increasing size allow converged results only in the absence of flow. We
   consider the effect of binding both in a secondary minimum controlled by
   a combination of electrostatic repulsion and depletion attraction, as
   well as in a primary minimum governed by induced-dipole attraction.
   Results are computed using both realistic interaction potentials and by
   replacing the potential with a simple cutoff gap distance at which
   binding is deemed to occur. Results agree with several existing reports
   including Smoluchowski predictions in the zero- and infinite-shear-rate
   limits, and high-Pe perturbation results of Feke and Schowalter {[}J.
   Fluid Mech. 133, 17-35 (1983)] at Peclet numbers (Pe) above 100.
   Finally, we compute binding times for anisotropic Janus particles which
   have both repulsive and attractive faces, for a wide range of Pe number.

Abstract = {{Pseudoternary phase diagrams of the PtOx-CaO-TiOx system were

   CaTiO3 made by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron
   microscopy. In this system, promoted as a self-regenerative automotive
   exhaust-gas catalyst, Pt precipitates as metallic particles from the
   doped perovskite under reducing conditions and tends to redissolve under
   oxidizing conditions. Due to the likely influence of kinetic limitations
   on experimental observations, we focus on a restricted (metastable)
   phase diagram in which single and other unobserved oxides of Pt are
   intentionally excluded. Various titanate phases appear, however, and
   their presence helps inform the calculation of the phase diagrams, which
   in turn confirm that the self-regenerative effect is a consequence of
   thermodynamic phase stability under the specific redox environments
   examined.}},

Abstract = {{The thermochemical nonequilibrium of the three lowest lying electronic
   states of molecular oxygen, O-2(X-3 Sigma(-)(g) , a(1) Delta(g) , b(1)
   Sigma(+)(g) ), through interactions with argon is studied in the present
   work. The multi-body potential energy surfaces of O-2+Ar are evaluated
   from the semi-classical RKR potential of O-2 in each electronic state.
   The rovibrational states and energies of each electronic state are
   calculated by the quantum mechanical method based on the present
   inter-nuclear potential of O-2. Then, the complete sets of the
   rovibrational state-to-state transition rate coefficients of O-2+Ar are
   calculated by the quasi-classical trajectory method including the
   quasi-bound states. The system of master equations constructed by the
   present state-to-state transition rate coefficients are solved to
   analyze the thermochemical nonequilibrium of O-2+Ar in various heat bath
   conditions. From these studies, it is concluded that the vibrational
   relaxation and coupled chemical reactions of each electronic state needs
   to be treated as a separate nonequilibrium process, and rotational
   nonequilibrium needs to be considered at translational temperatures
   above 10,000 K. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Height induced coupling behavior between the plasmonic modes and
   diffraction orders were studied in the core-shell SiO2/Au nanocylinder
   arrays (NCAs) using finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations.
   New lattice plasmon modes (LPMs) are observed in the structures with
   high aspect ratio. Specifically, parallel coupling between the plasmonic
   modes and diffraction orders is obtained here, which shows different
   coupling behavior from orthogonal LPMs. Electromagnetic (EM) field
   distributions indicate that horizontal propagation of the magnetic or
   electric field component is responsible for the generation of these
   orthogonal and parallel LPMs, respectively. Radiative loss could be
   effectively suppressed when the height increases. This is important for
   the applications of fluorescence enhancement and nano laser. Further
   studies confirm that the LPMs associated with the superstrate
   diffraction orders could be well maintained even when the Au coating is
   imperfect. The interference from the substrate associated LPMs could be
   eliminated by cutting off the corresponding diffraction waves by
   inducing a Si3N4 substrate. This study of coupling behavior in the
   core-shell NCAs enables a novel route to design and optimize the LPMs
   for applications of bio-sensing and nano laser. (C) 2015 Optical Society

   1.49 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C and the electrochemical stability
   window up to 4.2V (versus Li/Li+). It demonstrates excellent interface
   stability to lithium metal electrode, superior thermal stability and
   good mechanical properties. A symmetric Li/Li cell with the above
   electrolyte displays a lower voltage polarization and longer valid cycle
   life than that based on conventional liquid electrolyte. Moreover, the
   Li/LiFePO4 cells using the Semi-IPN GPE show superior cycling stability

Abstract = {{The accurate prediction of radiowave coverage at high frequency-ultra
   high frequency over irregular terrain features is of importance in the
   design and development of low-cost and low-power communication systems.
   This study studies the problem of electromagnetic wave propagation,
   excited by a short dipole, above a dielectric ground plane with an
   arbitrary dielectric profile and an irregular interface. This
   investigation is a natural extension of the classical Sommerfeld problem
   with the exception of the random surface irregularities at the interface
   between the two dielectric media. It is assumed that the interface
   profile height variations are small compared with the wavelength. First,
   the bistatic scattering of a plane wave illuminating the rough surface
   is solved using a perturbation solution of an integral equation for the
   induced polarisation current. Analytical expressions for the coherent
   field and incoherent scattered power at an arbitrary observation point
   are obtained. Then, the solutions for the coherent and incoherent
   scattered power generated by a small dipole of arbitrary orientation and
   position are derived by expanding the field of the dipole in terms of a
   continuous spectrum of plane waves and using superposition. The effects
   of the rough interface on the surface waves and on depolarisation are
   studied.}},

Title = {{Control of microtubule trajectory within an electric field by altering
   surface charge density}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{One of challenges for using microtubules (MTs) driven by kinesin motors
   in microfluidic environments is to control their direction of movement.
   Although applying physical biases to rectify MTs is prevalent, it has
   not been established as a design methodology in conjunction with
   microfluidic devices. In the future, the methodology is expected to
   achieve functional motor-driven nanosystems. Here, we propose a method
   to guide kinesin-propelled MTs in multiple directions under an electric
   field by designing a charged surface of MT minus ends labeled with dsDNA
   via a streptavidin-biotin interaction. MTs labeled with 20-bp or 50-bp
   dsDNA molecules showed significantly different trajectories according to
   the DNA length, which were in good agreement with values predicted from
   electrophoretic mobilities measured for their minus ends. Since the
   effective charge of labeled DNA molecules was equal to that of freely
   dispersed DNA molecules in a buffer solution, MT trajectory could be
   estimated by selecting labeling molecules with known charges. Moreover,
   the estimated trajectory enables to define geometrical sizes of a
   microfluidic device. This rational molecular design and prediction
   methodology allows MTs to be guided in multiple directions,
   demonstrating the feasibility of using molecular sorters driven by motor
   proteins.}},

   numerous bands with strongly mixed orbital characters signals the
   breakdown of the single-band Mott picture that characterizes its

   of structure-property relations for manipulating the subtle balance

Abstract = {{The study of mechanotransduction relies on tools that are capable of
   applying mechanical forces to elicit and assess cellular responses. Here
   we report a new (to our knowledge) technique, called two-bubble acoustic
   tweezing cytometry (TB-ATC), for generating spatiotemporally controlled
   subcellular mechanical forces on live cells by acoustic actuation of
   paired microbubbles targeted to the cell adhesion receptor integrin. By
   measuring the ultrasound-induced activities of cell-bound microbubbles
   and the actin cytoskeleton contractile force responses, we determine
   that TB-ATC elicits mechanoresponsive cellular changes via cyclic,
   paired displacements of integrin-bound microbubbles driven by the
   attractive secondary acoustic radiation force (sARF) between the bubbles
   in an ultrasound field. We demonstrate the feasibility of dual-mode
   TB-ATC for both subcellular probing and mechanical stimulation. By
   exploiting the robust and unique interaction of ultrasound with
   microbubbles, TB-ATC provides distinct advantages for experimentation
   and quantification of applied forces and cellular responses for
   biomechanical probing and stimulation of cells.}},

   and impurity-bound electron spins, respectively. We find that the
   impurity-bound electron spin dephasing mechanism is strongly anisotropic
   due to anisotropic exchange interactions. The identification of the two

Abstract = {{This paper considers feedback systems with asymmetric (i.e., non-odd
   functions) nonlinear actuators and sensors. While the stability of such
   systems can be investigated using the theory of absolute stability and
   its extensions, the current paper provides a method for their
   performance analysis, i.e., reference tracking and disturbance
   rejection. Similar to the case of symmetric nonlinearities considered in
   earlier work, the development is based on the method of stochastic
   linearisation (which is akin to the describing functions, but intended
   to study general properties of dynamics, rather than periodic regimes).
   Unlike the symmetric case, however, the nonlinearities considered here
   must be approximated not only by a quasilinear gain, but a quasilinear
   bias as well. This paper derives transcendental equations for the
   quasilinear gain and bias, provides necessary and sufficient conditions
   for existence of their solutions, and, using simulations, investigates
   the accuracy of these solutions as a tool for predicting the quality of
   reference tracking and disturbance rejection. The method developed is
   then applied to performance analysis of specific systems, and the effect
   of asymmetry on their behaviour is investigated. In addition, this
   method is used to justify the recently discovered phenomenon of
   noise-induced loss of tracking in feedback systems with PI controllers,
   anti-windup, and sensor noise.}},

Abstract = {{The energy efficiency and delivery robustness are two critical issues
   for low duty cycled wireless sensor networks. The asynchronous
   receiver-initiated duty cycling media access control (MAC) protocols
   have shown the effectiveness through various studies. In
   receiver-initiated MACs, packet transmission is triggered by the probe
   of receiver. However, it suffers from the performance degradation
   incurred by packet collision, especially under bursty traffic. Several
   protocols have been proposed to address this problem, but their
   performance is restricted by the unnecessary backoff time and long
   negotiation process. In this paper, we present Contention Detectable MAC
   (CD-MAC), an energy efficient and robust duty-cycled MAC for general
   wireless sensor network applications. By exploring the temporal
   diversity of the acknowledgements, a receiver recognizes the potential
   senders and subsequently polls individual senders one by one. We further
   design efficient algorithm to avoid the possible acknowledgement
   collision. We implement CD-MAC in TinyOS and evaluate the performance on
   an indoor testbed with single-hop and multi-hop networks. The results
   show that CD-MAC can significantly improve throughput by 1.72 times
   compared with the state-of-the-art receiver-initiated MAC protocol under
   bursty traffic loads. The results also demonstrate that CD-MAC can
   effectively mitigate the influence of hidden terminal problem and adapt
   to network dynamics well.}},

Abstract = {{National reports and initiatives indicate a critical need to produce
   more U.S. scientists and engineers and specify plans to fulfill this
   need by tapping into underrepresented populations such as women and
   minorities. Thus, it is crucial to address how diversity plays a role in
   higher education environments and the persistence of these populations
   in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors.
   Mentoring may be a mechanism that assists minority students, such as
   African Americans, with persisting in STEM majors which may help to
   increase diversity in higher education. However, there is a lack of
   understanding about what is occurring in African-American mentoring
   relationships and how mentors advise their proteges. The purpose of this
   study is to understand and interpret the mentoring approaches of select
   African-American STEM mentors in higher education. Ten select
   African-American STEM mentors were interviewed. Polkinghorne's narrative
   analysis and an open coding process were used to identify pervasive
   themes that emerged about mentors' mentoring approaches. Findings
   indicate that African-American STEM mentors employ mentoring approaches
   with their African-American STEM undergraduates that focus on providing
   resources and listening and relating to their proteges.}},

Abstract = {{Object detection systems based on the deep convolutional neural network
   (CNN) have recently made groundbreaking advances on several object
   detection benchmarks. While the features learned by these high-capacity
   neural networks are discriminative for categorization, inaccurate
   localization is still a major source of error for detection. Building
   upon high-capacity CNN architectures, we address the localization
   problem by 1) using a search algorithm based on Bayesian optimization
   that sequentially proposes candidate regions for an object bounding box,
   and 2) training the CNN with a structured loss that explicitly penalizes
   the localization inaccuracy. In experiments, we demonstrate that each of
   the proposed methods improves the detection performance over the
   baseline method on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets. Furthermore, two
   methods are complementary and significantly outperform the previous
   state-of-the-art when combined.}},

   Yet, these absurd inferences result from the current disregard for
   particular types of actors in action understanding. There is no work we
   know of on simultaneously inferring actors and actions in the video, not
   to mention a dataset to experiment with. Our paper hence marks the first
   effort in the computer vision community to jointly consider various
   types of actors undergoing various actions. To start with the problem,
   we collect a dataset of 3782 videos from YouTube and label both
   pixel-level actors and actions in each video. We formulate the general
   actor action understanding problem and instantiate it at various
   granularities: both video-level single- and multiple label actor-action
   recognition and pixel-level actor-action semantic segmentation. Our
   experiments demonstrate that inference jointly over actors and actions
   outperforms inference independently over them, and hence concludes our
   argument of the value of explicit consideration of various actors in
   comprehensive action understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Image classification has advanced significantly in recent years with the
   availability of large-scale image sets. However, fine-grained
   classification remains a major challenge due to the annotation cost of
   large numbers of fine-grained categories. This project shows that
   compelling classification performance can be achieved on such categories
   even without labeled training data. Given image and class embeddings, we
   learn a compatibility function such that matching embeddings are
   assigned a higher score than mismatching ones; zero-shot classification
   of an image proceeds by finding the label yielding the highest joint
   compatibility score. We use state-of-the-art image features and focus on
   different supervised attributes and unsupervised output embeddings
   either derived from hierarchies or learned from unlabeled text corpora.
   We establish a substantially improved state-of-the-art on the Animals
   with Attributes and Caltech-UCSD Birds datasets. Most encouragingly, we
   demonstrate that purely unsupervised output embeddings (learned from
   Wikipedia and improved with fine-grained text) achieve compelling
   results, even outperforming the previous supervised state-of-the-art. By
   combining different output embeddings, we further improve results.}},

   of human action has comparatively been unexplored. In this paper, we
   take a step in that direction and propose a hierarchical MRF model to
   bridge low-level video fragments with high-level human motion and
   appearance; novel higher-order potentials connect different levels of
   the supervoxel hierarchy to enforce the consistency of the human
   segmentation by pulling from different segment-scales. Our single layer
   model significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art on
   actionness, and our full model improves upon the single layer baselines

Abstract = {{Affordances are fundamental attributes of objects. Affordances reveal
   the functionalities of objects and the possible actions that can be
   performed on them. Understanding affordances is crucial for recognizing
   human activities in visual data and for robots to interact with the
   world. In this paper we introduce the new problem of mining the
   knowledge of semantic affordance: given an object, determining whether
   an action can be performed on it. This is equivalent to connecting verb
   nodes and noun nodes in Word Net, or filling an affordance matrix
   encoding the plausibility of each action-object pair. We introduce a new
   benchmark with crowdsourced ground truth affordances on 20 PASCAL VOC
   object classes and 957 action classes. We explore a number of approaches
   including text mining, visual mining, and collaborative filtering. Our
   analyses yield a number of significant insights that reveal the most
   effective ways of collecting knowledge of semantic affordances.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal power flow (OPF) problem minimizes the operating cost of an
   electric power system. Applications of convex relaxation techniques to
   the non-convex OPF problem have been of recent interest, including work
   using the Lasserre hierarchy of ``moment{''} relaxations to globally
   solve many OPF problems. By preprocessing the network model to eliminate
   low-impedance lines, this paper demonstrates the capability of the
   moment relaxations to globally solve large OPF problems that minimize
   active power losses for portions of several European power systems.
   Large problems with more general objective functions have thus far been
   computationally intractable for current formulations of the moment
   relaxations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the
   combination of an objective function penalization with the moment
   relaxations. This combination yields feasible points with objective
   function values that are close to the global optimum of several large
   OPF problems. Compared to an existing penalization method, the
   combination of penalization and the moment relaxations eliminates the
   need to specify one of the penalty parameters and solves a broader class
   of problems.}},

   decompose this decentralized minimization problem into two centralized
   constrained minimization problems. Each centralized constrained
   minimization problem is then reduced to a fully centralized sensor
   activation problem that is solved effectively by an algorithm presented

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a velocity coordination protocol for the control of
   multiple unicycle agents, which aims to address two distinct scenarios
   in a unified manner. The former case is aggregation around a goal
   location, while the latter case is navigation to multiple goal
   locations. The same linear velocity protocol is used in both cases, but
   slightly different angular velocity protocols are designed to achieve
   either aggregation or navigation, respectively. The proposed angular
   velocity protocols regulate the angular velocities of the agents to
   reference directions imposed by vector fields which are different for
   aggregation and navigation. The proposed linear velocity protocol
   imposes directed interactions among agents in the following sense: an
   implicit prioritization among locally connected agents is ad-hoc
   decided, which results in a suitable adjustment of the linear velocities
   of the connected agents so that each one slows down with respect to
   (w.r.t.) the neighbor agent who maximizes the rate of decrease of the
   inter-agent distance. Simulation results with multiple unicycle agents
   achieving either aggregation or navigation along collision-free
   trajectories are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution networks that supply large numbers of induction motors are
   vulnerable to Fault Induced Delayed Voltage Recovery. This phenomenon is
   usually triggered by a transmission fault but results in a delayed
   recovery of voltages in the distribution feeder, usually taking several
   seconds for a return to pre-fault conditions, if at all. The general
   mechanism underlying this delayed recovery arises from the coupled
   nonlinear dynamics of induction motors stalling. It is important to
   establish the phase boundary that separates parameters that lead to
   stalled versus unstalled motor states. This paper develops a novel
   algorithm, based on shooting methods and Euler homotopy continuation,
   for obtaining the phase boundaries. It forces a trajectory to spend a
   fixed amount of time near an unstable equilibrium, and then increases
   that time until the trajectory approaches the unstable equilibrium point
   arbitrarily closely. This technique does not require prior knowledge of
   the unstable equilibrium point. Numerically computed phase boundaries,
   in terms of induction motor moments of inertia, fault clearing times,
   and nonhomogeneous networks are presented. The techniques are formulated
   in generality, and could be applied to compute phase boundaries for a
   large class of dynamical systems.}},

Abstract = {{The paper considers a class of optimal control problems for

   maximize the total yield or time until the system exits a specified set.
   While algorithms such as value iteration or policy iteration may be used
   to solve the Bellman equation and find the optimal cost-to-go function
   and control policy, these algorithms may require a relatively large
   number of iterations to converge and the computational effort grows
   exponentially with the dimension of the system. This paper proposes a
   novel algorithm with the potential of achieving convergence of value
   iterations significantly faster. The new algorithm is based on adaptive
   proportional updates. This algorithm is applied to an optimal control
   problem of maximizing the lifetime of a satellite subject to J(2) and

Abstract = {{We study the problem of dynamic sensor activation for centralized
   partially-observed discrete event systems. The sensors can be turned
   on/off online dynamically according to a sensor activation policy in
   order to satisfy some observation property. In this paper, we consider a
   general class of properties, called Information-State-based (or
   IS-based) properties, which include, but are not limited to,
   observability, K-diagnosability, predictability, and opacity. We define
   a new Most Permissive Observer (MPO) that generalizes previous versions
   of this structure. The MPO that we define embeds all sensor activation
   policies for an IS-based property. An optimal sensor activation policy
   can then be synthesized based on the MPO. Our results generalize the
   previous works on dynamic sensor activation for enforcing the properties
   of observability, K-diagnosability, and opacity. Moreover, our MPO is
   applicable to solving dynamic sensor activation problems for a wide
   class of user-defined properties that can be formulated as IS-based
   properties. As a special case, we show that the problem of minimal
   sensor activation for enforcing predictability, which has not been
   considered in the literature, is solvable by our new approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the construction of geometric and variational
   methods for the optimal control of nonholonomic mechanical systems, and
   the construction of variational integrators for this class of optimal
   control problems. Given a cost function, the optimal control problem is
   understood as a constrained higher-order variational problem. Through a
   variational discretization of a Lagrangian defined in a submanifold of
   the tangent space of the constraint distribution, we obtain the discrete
   Euler-Lagrange equations for the nonholonomic optimal control problem.
   The optimal control of a Chaplygin sleigh is presented as an
   illustrative example.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual constraints are functional relations (i.e., constraints) on the
   state variables of a robot's model that are achieved through the action
   of actuators and feedback control instead of physical contact forces.
   They are called virtual because they can be re-programmed on the fly
   without modifying any physical connections among the links of the robot
   or its environment. Previous analytical and experimental work has
   established that vector relative degree two virtual holonomic (i.e.,
   only configuration dependent) constraints are a powerful means to
   synchronize the links of a bipedal robot so as to achieve walking and
   running motions over a variety of terrain profiles. This paper
   introduces a class of virtual nonholonomic constraints that depend on
   velocity through (generalized) angular momentum while maintaining the
   property of being relative degree two. This additional freedom is shown
   to yield control solutions that handle a wider range of gait
   perturbations arising from terrain variations and exogenous forces.
   Moreover, including angular momentum in the virtual constraints allows
   foot placement control to be rigorously designed on the basis of the
   full dynamic model of the biped, instead of on the basis of an inverted
   pendulum approximation of its center of mass, as is commonly done in the
   bipedal robotics literature. This new class of control laws is shown in
   simulation to be robust to a variety of common gait disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze a dynamic oligopoly model with strategic sellers and
   buyers/consumers over a finite horizon. Each seller has private
   information described by a finite-state Markov process; the Markov
   processes describing the sellers' information are mutually independent.
   At the beginning of each time/stage t the sellers simultaneously post
   the prices for their good; subsequently, consumers make their buying
   decisions; finally, after the buyers' decisions are made, a public
   signal, indicating the buyers' consumption experience from each seller's
   good becomes available and the whole process moves to stage t + 1. The
   sellers' prices, the buyers' decisions and the signal indicating the
   buyers' consumption experience are common knowledge among buyers and
   sellers. This dynamic oligopoly model arises in online shopping and
   dynamic spectrum sharing markets. The model gives rise to a stochastic
   dynamic game with asymmetric information. Using ideas from the common
   information approach (developed in {[}1] for decentralized
   decision-making), we prove the existence of common information based
   equilibria. We obtain a sequential decomposition of the game and we
   provide a backward induction algorithm to determine common
   information-based equilibria that are perfect Bayesian equilibria. We
   illustrate our results with an example.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies planar pursuit-evasion games that feature a group of
   players moving in an environment that may contain obstacles, where some
   players are pursuers and others are evaders. The goal of the pursuers is
   to capture the evaders, which requires the distance between one of the
   pursuers and one of the evaders to become zero. The goal of the evaders
   is to avoid capture. Specifically, this paper studies games with
   uncertainty in the parameters of the game, including the positions and
   speeds of the players as well as the positions of the obstacles. This
   work focuses on dominance regions, where a point in the environment is
   said to be dominated by one of the players if that player is able to
   reach the point before their opponent, regardless of the opponent's
   actions. In the existing literature, the use of dominance regions has
   been limited to games with perfect information about all players as well
   as the environment, and the key achievement of this paper is to extend
   the concept of dominance regions to practical scenarios where perfect
   information is unavailable.}},

Abstract = {{It has been a hot research topic to research the incorporation of
   large-scale PEVs into smart grid, such as the valley-fill strategy.
   However high charging rates under the valley-fill behavior may result in
   high battery degradation cost. Consequently in this paper, we novelly
   setup a framework to study a class of charging coordination problems
   which deals with the tradeoff between total generation cost and the
   accumulated battery degradation costs for all PEVs during a multi-time
   interval. Due to the autonomy of individual PEVs and the computational
   complexity for the system with large-scale PEV populations, it is
   impractical to implement the solution in a centralized way.
   Alternatively we propose a novel decentralized method such that each
   individual submits a charging profile, with respect to a given fixed
   price curve, which minimizes its own cost dealing with the tradeoff
   between the electricity cost and battery degradation cost over the
   charging interval; the price curve is updated based upon the aggregated
   PEV charging profiles. We show that, following the proposed
   decentralized price update procedure, the system converges to the unique
   efficient (in the sense of social optimality) solution under certain
   mild conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Repetitive processes are two dimensional (2D) systems that arise in the

   which information propagation occurs along two axes of independent
   variables. While the existing literature on repetitive processes is
   predominantly on linear systems, recent work highlights the need to
   develop rigorous tests for stability of nonlinear processes. Using
   existing results from linear repetitive process theory, we establish a
   differential repetitive process analogue of the well known result that
   the stability of a nonlinear feedback system can be verified by the
   stability of the linearized dynamics. In particular, we employ a 2D
   Lyapunov equation to show that the feasibility of a linear matrix
   inequality, combined with 2 small gain conditions, can guarantee
   stability locally around an equilibrium. Finally, we apply this result
   to the design and stability analysis of iterative learning control (ILC)

   low risk must be made. This paper develops a method to compute stability
   regions for a set of schedules for a prototypical mission for unmanned
   aircraft, the weighted multi-objective symmetric traveling salesman
   problem. A stability region associated with an optimal solution is the
   set of all perturbations to the input parameters for which that solution
   remains optimal. In particular, this paper studies perturbations to the
   weights and costs in the objective functions. This work has multiple
   potential benefits such as providing insight into how robust a solution
   is with respect to modeling uncertainties, how limited intelligence
   resources should be allocated, and the influence of each objective on
   the solution. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the methods
   developed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with distributed H-infinity filtering for a
   class of continuous-time linear plants over sensor networks with
   multiple communication channels (MCCs). A practical framework is
   presented to optimize communication over MCCs with uncertain delays and
   switching characteristics. The channel switching is assumed to follow a
   continuous-time Markov chain and a Markov jump linear system (MJLS) is
   exploited to model the overall networked system. A class of
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are constructed to derive sufficient
   conditions on stochastic stability and H-infinity performance of the
   MJLS in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Furthermore, the filtering
   parameter design is presented by employing Projection Lemma and LMI
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue-engineered skeletal muscle holds promise as a source of graft
   tissue for repair of volumetric muscle loss and as a model system for
   pharmaceutical testing. To reach this potential, engineered tissues must
   advance past the neonatal phenotype that characterizes the current state
   of the art. In this review, we describe native skeletal muscle
   development and identify important growth factors controlling this
   process. By comparing in vivo myogenesis to in vitro satellite cell
   cultures and tissue engineering approaches, several key similarities and
   differences that may potentially advance tissue-engineered skeletal
   muscle were identified. In particular, hepatocyte and fibroblast growth
   factors used to accelerate satellite cell activation and proliferation,
   followed by addition of insulin-like growth factor as a potent inducer
   of differentiation, are proven methods for increased myogenesis in
   engineered muscle. Additionally, we review our recent novel application
   of dexamethasone ( DEX), a glucocorticoid that stimulates myoblast
   differentiation, in skeletal muscle tissue engineering. Using our
   established skeletal muscle unit ( SMU) fabrication protocol, timing-and
   dose-dependent effects of DEX were measured. The supplemented SMUs
   demonstrated advanced sarcomeric structure and significantly increased
   myotube diameter and myotube fusion compared to untreated controls. Most
   significantly, these SMUs exhibited a fivefold rise in force production.
   Thus, we concluded that DEX may serve to improve myogenesis, advance
   muscle structure, and increase force production in engineered skeletal
   muscle. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Current manufacturing operations are increasingly pushed to boost
   profits through improved efficiency and quality. A common approach to
   enhance production is through the adoption of new machines, modified
   production schedules, and the integration of new products. Existing
   methods for validating the impact of these modifications either ignore
   the physical implementation challenges through only simulation-based
   analysis or require costly run off processes on the physical system. To
   mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a virtual fusion
   environment in which the physical and simulated systems are run
   simultaneously, enabling real-time analysis and integration of virtual
   parts within the physical manufacturing system. A virtual fusion filter
   is used to synchronize and augment input signals to a local controller
   to represent the physical effects of a given process on a virtual part
   within the physical system. Experimental results on a reconfigurable
   manufacturing test platform demonstrate the validity of the proposed
   approach. (C) 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control)

Abstract = {{Production systems with infinite buffers typically have the lead time
   (LT) vs. throughput (TP) characteristic curve (CC) with a knee-type
   shape. Operating the system below the knee is not efficient, since TP
   can be increased without an appreciable increase in LT. Operating the
   system above the knee is also counterproductive, since LT becomes
   extremely large without a significant increase of TP. Thus, the
   desirable operating point is at the knee, which is why it is often
   referred to in practice as the ``sweet point{''}. In this paper, using
   an empirical/analytical approach, CCs of re-entrant lines described by
   the bottleneck workcenter-based model with exponential machines are
   analyzed, the positions of the sweet point are quantified, and an open-
   and closed-loop job release strategies that ensure the operation at the
   knee are developed. The development is carried out in terms of the First
   Buffer First Served and Last Buffer First Served dispatch policies,
   although CCs for other policies can be investigated in a similar manner.

Abstract = {{As we show in this paper, I/O has become the limiting factor in scaling
   down size and power toward the goal of invisible computing. Achieving
   this goal will require composing optimized and specialized yet reusable
   components with an interconnect that permits tiny, ultra-low power
   systems. In contrast to today's interconnects which are limited by
   power-hungry pull-ups or high-overhead chip-select lines, our approach
   provides a superset of common bus features but at lower power, with
   fixed area and pin count, using fully synthesizable logic, and with
   surprisingly low protocol overhead.
   We present MBus, a new 4-pin, 22.6 plibit/chip chip-to chip interconnect
   made of two ``shoot-through{''} rings. MBus facilitates ultra-low power
   system operation by implementing automatic power-gating of each chip in
   the system, easing the integration of active, inactive, and activating
   circuits on a single die. In addition, we introduce a new bus primitive:
   power oblivious communication, which guarantees message reception
   regardless of the recipient's power state when a message is sent. This
   disentangles power management from communication, greatly simplifying
   the creation of viable, modular, and heterogeneous systems that operate
   on the order of nanowatts.
   To evaluate the viability, power, performance, overhead, and scalability
   of our design, we build both hardware and software implementations of
   MBus and show its seamless operation across two FPGAs and twelve custom
   chips from three different semiconductor processes. A three-chip, 2.2
   mm3 MBus system draws 8 nW of total system standby power and uses only
   22.6 pFbit/chip for communication. This is the lowest power for any
   system bus with MBus `s feature set.}},

   can be altered by changing the groove's height. Piezoelectric material
   has been implemented to control the groove's height and, as a result,
   the band-gap of the switch can be controlled. By applying voltage across

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering strategies have shown promise in promoting healing
   and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI); however, these
   strategies are limited by inflammation and the immune response.
   Infiltration of cells of the innate and adaptive immune responses and
   the inflammation that follows cause secondary damage adjacent to the
   injury, increased scarring, and a potently inhibitory environment for
   the regeneration of damaged neurons. While the inflammation that ensues
   is typically associated with limited regeneration, the immune response
   is a crucial element in the closing of the blood-brain barrier,
   minimizing the spread of injury, and initiating healing. This review
   summarizes the strategies that have been developed to modulate the
   immune response towards an anti-inflammatory environment that is
   permissive to the regeneration of neurons, glia, and parenchyma. We
   focus on the use of biomaterials, biologically active molecules, gene
   therapy, nanoparticles, and stem cells to modulate the immune response,
   and illustrate concepts for future therapies. Current clinical
   treatments for SCI are limited to systemic hypothermia or
   methylprednisolone, which both act by systemically mitigating the
   effects of immune response but have marginal efficacy. Herein, we
   discuss emerging research strategies to further enhance these clinical
   treatments by directly targeting specific aspects of the immune
   response. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Control of an antilock brake system for aircraft and land vehicles is
   based upon estimates of the torque applied to braking wheels by means of
   a sliding mode observer. The observer yields a highly accurate estimate
   of torque that is robust for the entire operating range of the brakes,
   and provides an input to a relatively simple control system that
   regulates applied torque from either an electro-hydraulic or
   electromechanical actuator. Excellent braking performance for a regional
   jet transport is demonstrated in this paper via hardware-in-the-loop
   simulation. A simple scheme for suppressing gear walk (aircraft
   application) is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Freshly deposited or disturbed sands experience time-dependent increase
   in small strain stiffness and delayed increase in cone penetration
   resistance. Evolution of micro-mechanical properties at inter-granular
   contacts has been proposed as one of the key causes of time effects in
   silica sands. Previous work did not produce sufficient information about
   evolution of individual contacts, neither did it indicate how to relate
   such information to time-dependent behavior of particle assemblies. A
   static fatigue hypothesis was proposed recently, which identifies the
   delayed fracturing of surface textural features at contact as the key
   cause of time-dependent behavior of sands. Laboratory fatigue tests were
   carried out on an individual contact between a single grain and a flat
   stainless steel surface. The normal load was kept constant and the
   displacement of the grain relative to the stainless steel plate was
   monitored. It is evident that the response of the contact is
   time-dependent with decaying characteristics, which is consistent with
   the hypothesis of static fatigue.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we apply an emerging method, online learning with
   dynamics, to deduce properties of distributed energy resources (DERs)
   from coarse measurements, e.g., measurements taken at distribution
   substations, rather than household-level measurements. Reduced sensing
   requirements can lower infrastructure costs associated with reliably
   incorporating DERs into the distribution network. We specifically
   investigate whether dynamic mirror descent (DMD), an online learning
   algorithm, can determine the real-time controllable demand served by a
   distribution feeder using feeder-level active power demand measurements.
   In our scenario, DMD incorporates various controllable demand and
   uncontrollable demand models to generate real-time controllable demand
   estimates. In a realistic scenario, these estimates have an RMS error of
   8.34\% of the average controllable demand, which improves to 5.53\% by
   incorporating more accurate models. We propose topics for additional
   work in modeling, system identification, and the DMD algorithm itself
   that could improve the RMS errors.}},

   traveled between samples. This is motivated by our work studying regions
   of low oxygen concentration in the Great Lakes. We show that for
   one-dimensional threshold classifiers, a tradeoff between number of
   samples and distance traveled can be achieved using a generalization of
   binary search, which we refer to as quantile search. We derive the
   expected total sampling time for noiseless measurements and the expected
   number of samples for an extension to the noisy case. We illustrate our
   results in simulations relevant to our sampling application.}},

Abstract = {{Type-3 and Type-4 wind turbines are capable of contributing to the
   reactive power required by wind-farms for supporting grid voltages.
   However, characterizing the maximum reactive power capability of a
   wind-farm by summing the individual generator ratings does not account
   for the effects of voltage variations over the radial collector network
   and can significantly overestimate the total reactive power production
   capacity. This paper considers the reactive power produced by a
   wind-farm in response to a common reactive power set-point Q(set) that
   is broadcast to all wind turbines. Analysis shows that a sustained
   increase in Q(set) will result in the wind-farm delivering maximal
   reactive power. Several examples demonstrate that generator voltage
   limits can significantly curtail the reactive power output requested by
   the control strategy. This improved characterization of wind-farm
   reactive power production capabilities, which takes into account
   collector network voltages, will enable better design and operation of
   wind-farm reactive power resources, reducing the need for additional
   shunt capacitors and static synchronous compensators.}},

Abstract = {{When energy storage units, such as batteries, are installed to support
   photovoltaics and defer power system upgrades they are inactive or only
   partially used most of time. Their unused capacities could be used to
   provide frequency control, allowing them to generate additional
   revenues. However, the challenge is to decide how much of their energy
   and power capacities to allocate to either service. Photovoltaic
   generation profiles are difficult to forecast accurately, and frequency
   deviation is a highly stochastic process. This paper develops a
   Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) approach to generate decision
   rules for determining how much capacity to assign to each service at
   each time step, depending on the time of day and the storage energy
   level. Unlike Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP), our approach does
   not require us to discretize the state and decision spaces. We show
   that, when storage efficiency is high, SDDP outperforms SDP, but when
   short computation times are required, SDP may be preferred. We also
   discuss challenges associated with using SDDP when storage efficiency is
   lower than unity. Finally, we show that the number of tuning parameters
   is lower for SDDP than for SDP, and that the relation between tuning
   parameters and policy quality is more intuitive for SDDP than for SDP.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, convex ``moment{''} relaxations developed from the Lasserre
   hierarchy for polynomial optimization problems have been shown capable
   of globally solving many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. The moment
   relaxations, which take the form of semidefinite programs (SDP),
   generalize a previous SDP relaxation of the OPF problem. This paper
   presents an approach for improving the computational performance of the
   moment relaxations for many problems. This approach enforces
   second-order cone programming (SOCP) constraints that establish
   necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for satisfaction of the SDP
   constraints arising from the higher-order moment relaxations. The
   resulting ``mixed SDP/SOCP{''} formulation implements the first-order
   relaxation using SDP constraints and the higher-order relaxations using
   SOCP constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that this mixed SDP/SOCP
   relaxation is capable of solving many problems for which the first-order
   moment relaxation fails to yield a global solution. For several
   examples, the mixed SDP/SOCP relaxation improves computational speed by
   factors from 1.13 to 18.7.}},

Abstract = {{Hearings of witnesses and defendants play a crucial role when reaching
   court trial decisions. Given the high-stake nature of trial outcomes,
   implementing accurate and effective computational methods to evaluate
   the honesty of court testimonies can offer valuable support during the
   decision making process. In this paper, we address the identification of
   deception in real-life trial data. We introduce a novel dataset
   consisting of videos collected from public court trials. We explore the
   use of verbal and non-verbal modalities to build a multimodal deception
   detection system that aims to discriminate between truthful and
   deceptive statements provided by defendants and witnesses. We achieve
   classification accuracies in the range of 60-75\% when using a model
   that extracts and fuses features from the linguistic and gesture
   modalities. In addition, we present a human deception detection study
   where we evaluate the human capability of detecting deception in trial
   hearings. The results show that our system outperforms the human
   capability of identifying deceit.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally seafloor surveys have been conducted with research
   vessels, divers or with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and are
   time consuming, expensive and high risk. In this paper we present an
   approach to merge sonar and monocular images to perform large scale
   mapping of shallow areas from an autonomous surface vessel (ASV),
   reducing the mission time, cost and risk. Our method uses multibeam
   sonar data to generate a mesh of the seafloor. Optical images are then
   blended and projected onto the mesh after a color correction process
   which increases contrast and overall image quality. In applicable
   scenarios, ASVs offer an alternative approach to AUVs for autonomous
   acoustic and optical site mapping. ASVs are typically less expensive
   than AUVs and often offer easier deployment and recovery logistics.
   Also, the mechanical requirements are less demanding because they do not
   have to withstand increased atmospheric water pressure at depth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on an algorithm for underwater visual place
   recognition in the presence of dramatic appearance change. Long-term
   visual place recognition is challenging underwater due to biofouling,
   corrosion, and other effects that lead to dramatic visual appearance
   change, which often causes traditional point-based feature methods to
   perform poorly. Building upon the authors' earlier work, this paper
   presents an algorithm for underwater vehicle place recognition and
   relocalization that enables an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to
   relocalize itself to a previously-built simultaneous localization and
   mapping (SLAM) graph. High-level structural features are learned using a
   supervised learning framework that retains features that have a high
   potential to persist in the underwater environment. Combined with a
   particle filtering framework, these features are used to provide a
   probabilistic representation of localization confidence. The algorithm
   is evaluated on real data, from multiple years, collected by a Hovering
   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (HAUV) for ship hull inspection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method for automating detection and segmentation
   of archaeological structures in underwater environments. Underwater
   archaeologists have recently taken advantage of robotic or
   diver-operated stereo-vision platforms to survey and map submerged
   archaeological sites. From the acquired stereo images, 3D reconstruction
   can be performed to produce high-resolution photo-mosaic maps that are
   metrically accurate and contain information about depth. Archaeologists
   can then use these maps to manually outline or sketch features of
   interest, such as building plans of a submerged city. These features
   often contain large rocks that serve as the foundation to buildings and
   are arranged in patterns and geometric shapes that are characteristic of
   human-made structures. Our proposed method first detects these large
   rocks based on texture and depth information. Next, we exploit the
   characteristic geometry of human-made structures to identify foundation
   rocks arranged along lines to form walls. Then we propose to optimize
   the outlines of these walls by using the gradient of depth to seek the
   local minimum of the height from the seafloor to identify the ground
   plane at the base of the rocks. Finally, we output contours as
   geo-referenced layers for geographic information system (GIS) and
   architectural planning software. Experiments are based on a 2010 stereo
   reconstruction survey of Pavlopetri, a submerged city off the coast of
   Greece. The results provide a proof-of-concept for automating extraction
   of archaeological structure in underwater environments to produce
   geo-referenced contours for further analysis by underwater
   archaeologists.}},

Abstract = {{The direct runtime interpretation and execution of domain-specific
   models through the use of a Domain Specific Virtual Machine (DSVM) is an
   area of emerging relevance in the model-driven engineering community.
   This is due in part to the increased efficiency and decreased complexity
   achieved through specialization of the architecture in disparate
   domains. An approach to the design of a DSVM is to include a middleware
   that is responsible for the delivery and management of domain-specific
   services. It is the job of this middleware to help realize user intent
   through the execution of received commands while ensuring adherence to
   system policies based on changing environmental context.
   To provide assurance of functionality, the DSVM middleware must be
   policy and context-aware and facilitate variability in its operations.
   It achieves this variability by dynamically generating behavioral models
   for execution in response to commands. The dynamic generation of models
   poses the challenge of ensuring their correctness at runtime. To
   guarantee the correctness of generated models, we adopted model
   validation techniques to ensure policy compliance and employed the Alloy
   Analyzer in our prototype to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.
   This granted us use of the Alloy specification language, which, by
   utilizing first-order logic, enhanced our model validation process by
   allowing more expressive policies. We demonstrate the increased
   capabilities and assurance realized by this approach through a case
   study with a DSVM middleware instance for the communication domain.}},

Abstract = {{Sensors capable of operating in harsh environments for long periods of
   time and having wireless readout capability are needed for mapping
   environmental conditions in remote areas, such as polar regions. In this
   paper, we report the first measured results of an innovative in-situ
   system of controllable and wind-opportunistic spherical mobile sensors
   (called Moballs), used to monitor and map various environmental factors
   in polar areas. To have self-powered controlled motion, Moballs exploit
   the abundance of wind and a novel dual-functioning mechanical control
   and linear induction system. Moballs have peer-to-peer and
   Moball-to-base (e.g. satellite) communication capability, reporting the
   sensory data back to the base station or other peer Moballs for task
   sharing decisions, improving area coverage, optimizing system
   performance, etc.}},

Abstract = {{The viscosity of subsurface hydrocarbons is commonly determined by
   sampling produced fluids at the surface. However, bringing hydrocarbons
   to surface temperature and pressure can irreversibly alter their
   viscosity. There are wireline tools that make in-situ measurements, but
   these require long, heavy cables, specialized equipment and large
   service crews, making the process logistically challenging and
   expensive. In this paper we describe a novel sensor system for downhole
   measurements of viscosity, density, and other fluid properties. The
   sensing capabilities are realized by the use of a commercially available
   piezoelectric tuning fork oscillator, which probes the fluid through the
   interaction of its prongs with the boundary layer of fluid around it.
   The miniature footprint of the device allows us to integrate it into a
   small-scale untethered tool that can be easily deployed for well
   logging. We show our implementation and laboratory characterization of
   the tuning fork. To gauge its capabilities under harsh environmental
   conditions, the sensor was studied while immersed in fluids
   representative of those found downhole and, separately, under conditions
   of high pressure and temperature. The tool integration and measurement
   schemes are also described. This system is a first step toward the
   development of an inexpensive, integrated, and miniaturized sensing
   platform for the in-situ characterization of reservoir fluids.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explore key design parameters for integrating fluidic
   logic and actuators for a very-large shape display for application in
   braille and tactile graphics. We present a simple model of
   pressure-controlled flow valves, which are analogous to electric
   transistors. The model is used to highlight the design of a valve that
   achieves hysteresis (noise immunity) and pressure-gain (signal
   propagation), both critical goals for creating fluidic logic circuits.
   Empirical results from a family of valves fabricated with graded design
   parameters and assembled in a logical NOT gate configuration back up the
   model. A pressure-gain of up to 26 kPa is achieved for a 80 kPa pressure
   supply, enabling the output of any logic gate to serve as the input of
   another in a sequential logic operation. Using the pressure-gain valves,
   we successfully built a latching memory unit that can be integrated with
   a pneumatic actuator capable of driving a braille pin. The design is
   sufficiently scalable and manufacturable to support the realization of a
   large dense array of pins at braille spacing.}},

Abstract = {{A strain hardening cementitous composite (SHCC) with extreme tensile
   ductility exceeding 2\% was used to construct a link slab for a
   jointless bridge deck on Grove Street bridge over I-94 in Michigan, USA.
   The superior ductility of SHCC was expected to accommodate bridge deck
   deformations imposed by girder deflection, concrete shrinkage, and
   temperature variations, providing a cost-effective solution to a number
   of deterioration problems associated with bridge deck joints. Three days
   after placement on the bridge in fall 2005, early age cracking was found
   in the link slab. Although these cracks are small, about half the size
   allowable by ASSHTO, and they are bridged by fibers with load carrying
   capability, it is desirable to eliminate such early age cracking as much
   as possible. Systematic investigations (both numerical and experimental)
   have been conducted on identifying factors which cause early age
   cracking. It was concluded that the formation of early age cracking in
   Grove Street bridge SHCC link slab was a combination of several factors
   including low water-to-cement ratio of SHCC mix, use of gravity mixer,
   wind effect, high curing temperature, low curing humidity, presence of
   steel reinforcing bars, excessive restraint, high skew angle, and
   inadequate soaking water for curing.}},

Abstract = {{Today's classroom and learner cohorts are supported by new and
   innovative technology in an unprecedented manner. The pace of
   technological advancements however does present challenges to educators
   in keeping abreast of the state of the art while concurrently
   facilitating a learner-certered approach. Topics within software
   engineering are especially susceptible to this phenomena and demands a
   more individualized adaptive model to support significant learning.
   Although there is an abundance of sound theoretical models which may
   address the challenge, the literature is sparse as to contextualization,
   application or concrete operation. Within a blended classroom, we have
   implemented an adaptive approach to address the pace of technology
   advancements with consideration for the skillsets and declarative
   knowledge of the learner.
   In this paper we present our approach within a software testing and
   maintenance course and discuss the lessons learnt. We have based our
   approach on the scientific grounding of Vygotsky's zone of proximal
   development and discuss the necessary scaffolding, inherent challenges
   and present an evaluation based on pre/post testing.}},

Abstract = {{The portion of clock power in system is rapidly increasing with the
   continuous increasing of clock frequency and clock resources. Last two
   decades, a great research attention has been paid to minimizing the
   clock power. Recently, it is shown that the structure of resonant clock
   networks is very effective in saving power since it can store electric
   energy to the inserted inductors rather than dissipate. On the other
   side, it has been known that dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) is
   one of the most effectively and widely used power reduction techniques.
   However, so far no works have addressed the problem of synthesizing
   resonant clock networks that are able to operate under the designs with
   DVFS capability even though the problem is potentially very important to
   maximize the synergy effect on saving power. In this context, this work
   proposes a comprehensive solution to the problem. Precisely, we propose
   a two-phase synthesis algorithm: (1) formulating the problem of inductor
   allocation, placement, and adjustable-sizing to support DVFS into a
   weighted set cover problem with the objective of minimizing total area
   of inductors followed by (2) performing the task of resizing of
   adjustable driving buffers to support the switch of driving strength
   according to the clock frequencies by DVFS. Through experiments with
   benchmark circuits, it is shown that for designs with DVFS using 1GHz
   and 3GHz, our algorithm synthesizes resonant clock networks with 17\%
   less power on the execution of the clock frequency, which is not
   supported by resonant clocking in the previous no-DVFS aware resonant
   clock synthesis algorithm.}},

   present in multiple noisy matrix-valued datasets using multiset
   canonical correlation analysis (MCCA). We show that empirical MCCA will
   provably fail to infer the presence of latent correlations when the
   sample size is less than a threshold that is completely specified by the
   dimensionality of the datasets. For the setting where the individual
   noisy data matrices are structured as low-rank-plus-noise, we propose a
   simple modification of MCCA, which we label Informative MCCA (IMCCA). We
   show, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, that IMCCA reliably
   infers and learns latent correlations.}},

   challenges associated with noisy, uncertain, multi-source data. While
   many ad-hoc graph fusion techniques exist in the current literature, an
   analytical approach for analyzing the fundamentals of the graph fusion
   problem is lacking. We consider the setting where we are given multiple
   Erdos-Renyi modeled adjacency matrices containing a common hidden or
   planted clique. The objective is to combine them linearly so that the
   principal eigenvectors of the resulting matrix best reveal the vertices
   associated with the clique. We utilize recent results from random matrix

Abstract = {{Fourier velocity encoding (FVE) is a promising magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) method for assessment of cardiovascular blood flow. FVE
   provides considerably higher signal-to-noise ratio than phase contrast
   (PC) imaging, is robust to partial-volume effects and can be acquired
   rapidly using spiral readouts. On the other hand, FVE data do not
   directly provide a velocity map. These maps are useful for calculating
   the actual blood flow through a vessel, or for guiding computational
   fluid dynamics simulations (CFD). In this paper, FVE data were simulated
   from PC velocity maps from a pulsatile carotid flow phantom; velocity
   maps were then reconstructed from these FVE data, and used to guide CFD
   simulations. FVE-guided CFD velocity fields were qualitatively and
   quantitatively compared with the PC-measured velocity field, with the
   pure CFD solution, and with PC-guided CFD. The results show that
   FVE-guided CFD achieves better agreement with the PC-measured velocity
   field than pure CFD. Compared with PC-guided CFD, FVE provides
   considerably better results than PC with similar scan time, and
   equivalent results when compared with PC with 9 times longer scan time.}},

   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) whole genome sequence
   (WGS) data offers new power to investigate mechanisms of AD by combining
   entire genome sequences with neuroimaging and clinical data. Here we
   explore the ADNI WGS SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data in depth
   and extract approximately six million valid SNP features. We investigate
   imaging genetics associations using Lasso regression-a widely used
   sparse learning technique. To solve the large-scale Lasso problem more
   efficiently, we employ a highly efficient screening rule for
   Lasso-called dual polytope projections (DPP)-to remove irrelevant
   features from the optimization problem. Experiments demonstrate that the
   DPP can effectively identify irrelevant features and leads to a 400x
   speedup. This allows us for the first time to run the compute-intensive
   model selection procedure called stability selection to rank SNPs that
   may affect the brain and AD risk.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two new and novel methods to separate network
   connections between those that have originated behind the Tor network
   and those that have not. Our methods identify Tor inbound connections
   through the use of two distinct timing signatures, delay and round-trip
   time, that can be used to create effective metrics. In order to evaluate
   our methods' ability to correctly identify Tor connections, we present
   the results of two small-scale experiments, one testing performance with
   HTTP traffic and the other testing SSH. These experiments resulted in
   very high accuracy rates (100\% and 98.99\% respectively) when
   partitioning network connections into Tor and non-Tor originating
   connections. Through the use of our techniques, we believe that inbound
   connections that have traversed the Tor network can be identified on a
   per-connection basis rather than the current per-IP basis.}},

Abstract = {{A millimeter wave (mm-wave) two-dimensional slot antenna array,
   operating at 28 GHz, is designed and presented in this paper. The
   antenna array consists of 8 elements in a 2x4 configuration. A 1-to-4
   power divider is feeding the 2x4 slot antenna array in both schemes;
   parallel and series. The bandwidth achieved for the integrated system
   was almost 5\% with a center frequency at 28.2 GHz. The occupied size
   was 29.9x28.7x0.13 mm(3), making it easier to fit within handheld
   devices for the upcoming 5G cellular standards.}},

   Standard results suggest that under full competition the equilibrium
   only exists when all sellers have zero profit. We introduce a regulator

   coalition/association, whose role is to enable money transfer based on
   partial observations of the sellers' actions. We show that by proper
   design of the transfer mechanism, efficient equilibrium
   (profit-maximizing or profit-positive) can be achieved, thereby
   providing an alternative to other competition-voiding mechanisms such as

   labeler is determined via a saddle point algorithm. The results on
   several crowdsourced data show that supervised methods can achieve
   better classification accuracy than unsupervised methods, and our
   proposed method outperforms other algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{One of the the most propitious enablers of the Smart Grid paradigm, and
   a rather low-hanging fruit, is Demand Response (DR) programs. DR is a
   set of courses of actions to reach and maintain the supply-demand
   equilibrium of the power grid from the side of the demand through price
   or incentive-based routines. The latter includes many programs with some
   bidding component. The general consensus among the experts is that the
   impact of the benefits is multiplied as DR program participation from
   the consumption side increases. However, there is an increasing
   awareness in public about privacy implications of many technological
   implementations including SG and DR deployments. In this paper, we are
   proposing a fully private bidding mechanism as part of a DR program to
   protect all the bidding details except for the winning price and winner
   at the end of the auction. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the
   first approach in the literature that accomplishes full privacy in a DR
   program without relying on a trusted third party. Preliminary simulation
   results show that the proposed mechanism presents a feasible solution
   for day-ahead and hour-ahead bidding mechanisms in the SG.}},

   injection of a train of multiple electron pulse into a diode is

   injected. By comparing with numerical solutions, we obtain an analytical
   formula, which can quickly provide such upper limit of charge density
   injection once the values of gap spacing, gap voltage and the initial
   time separation between the pulses are provided. The model has been
   verified with the numerical solutions of the equation of motion up to a
   few MeV of beam energy for which the relativistic effect is included.

Abstract = {{This paper explores several mechanisms to enhance the coherent
   Smith-Purcell radiation (SPR) at THz frequencies. A simple analytical
   dispersion relation is derived to predict the operating frequency for
   both open grating and Orotron-like devices. The analytical predictions
   are in excellent agreement with particle-in-cell simulations. It is
   found that the start current for a continuous electron beam to excite
   coherent SPR can be reduced by orders of magnitude, by merely varying
   the groove width and height of the grating, with grating period and beam
   energy being held constant. Other mechanisms, such as prebunched beams
   and open cavity configurations are also investigated for the enhancement
   of coherent SPR.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to discuss the feasibility of inter-operation between
   wireless chargers with four basic compensation topologies and that with
   the double-sided LCC compensation topology. A brief analysis of
   double-sided LCC compensation topology is provided based on our previous
   researches. The paper mainly presents the design considerations of the
   different compensation topologies: (1) The secondary sides with series
   compensation and parallel compensation when they work with an LCC
   compensation topology as the primary side; (2) The primary sides with
   series compensation and parallel compensation when they work with LCC
   compensation topology as the secondary side. So in all, four topologies
   will be discussed respectively: LCC-S, LCC-P, S-LCC, and P-LCC. A
   wireless charger prototype with double-sided LCC compensation topology
   has been re-designed into LCC-S type wireless charger to verify the
   analysis. The efficiency is 95.8\% from DC to DC even there is 275mm

   the TRW simulator. Experimental results on real world driving recordings
   illustrated that the proposed method can detect the drowsiness with an

Abstract = {{The Michigan Ion Beam Laboratory houses a 1.7 MV tandem accelerator. For
   many years this accelerator was configured to run with three ion
   sources: a TORoidal Volume Ion Source (TORVIS), a Duoplasmatron source
   and a Sputter source. In this article we describe an application we have
   created using the SIMION (R) code to simulate the trajectories of ion
   beams produced with these sources through the accelerator. The goal of
   this work is to have an analytical tool to understand the effect of each
   electromagnetic component on the ion trajectories. This effect is shown
   in detailed drawings. Each ion trajectory simulation starts at the
   aperture of the ion source and ends at the position of the target. Using
   these simulations, new accelerator operators or users quickly understand
   how the accelerator system works. Furthermore, these simulations allow
   analysis of modifications in the ion beam optics of the accelerator by
   adding, removing or replacing components or changing their relative
   positions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tissue-mimicking material for needle
   insertion was manufactured and evaluated. Factorial design of experiment
   was conducted by changing three factors - the ratio of softener and PVC
   polymer solution, the mass fraction of mineral oil, and the mass
   fraction of microsized glass beads - to study the indentation hardness,
   compression elastic modulus and friction and cutting forces in needle
   insertion of 12 types of soft PVC material. The indentation hardness of
   the soft PVC material ranged from 5 to 50. The elastic modulus of the
   soft PVC material was from 6 to 45 kPa between 0-0.15 strain. The
   friction and cutting force during needle insertion also had large
   ranges, which were from 0.005 to 0.086 N/mm and 0.04 to 0.36 N
   respectively. The analysis of variance showed that the ratio of softener
   and PVC polymer solution had the most significant effect on all of the
   four properties of the PVC material. The percentage of mineral oil also
   had statistical significance on these four properties. The glass beads
   only had effect on the needle insertion cutting force. A nonlinear
   regression model was applied to find relationships among mechanical
   properties and the significant factors. The R-2 values of the regression
   analysis results were all larger than 0.9. Four properties of a PVC
   tissue-mimicking material can be designed to desired values based on
   these relationships.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a constrained Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
   formalism for the optimal control of nonholonomic mechanical systems. In
   particular, we aim to minimize a cost functional, given initial and
   final conditions where the controlled dynamics are given by a
   nonholonomic mechanical system. In our paper, the controlled equations
   are derived using a basis of vector fields adapted to the nonholonomic
   distribution and the Riemannian metric determined by the kinetic energy.
   Given a cost function, the optimal control problem is understood as a
   constrained problem or equivalently, under some mild regularity
   conditions, as a Hamiltonian problem on the cotangent bundle of the
   nonholonomic distribution. A suitable Lagrangian submanifold is also
   shown to lead to the correct dynamics. Application of the theory is
   demonstrated through several examples including optimal control of the
   Chaplygin sleigh, a continuously variable transmission, and a problem of
   motion planning for obstacle avoidance.}},

Abstract = {{Power management of a ship's electrical system has become important due
   to increasing loads front manpower-reducing automation, greater power
   requirements of advanced weapons and sensors, introduction of all
   electric propulsion, and the increasing cost of oil-based fossil fuels.
   A coordinated power management strategy of the ship's electric power
   grid is desired to optimally allocate power flows and minimize fuel
   consumption. This paper develops such an optimal power management system
   for an interconnected, supervisory-level ship power system model based
   upon a ship power system test bed developed for the Office of Naval
   Research. The ship power system consists of two electrical generators,
   one rated at 59 kW to represent a gas turbine engine-generator pair and
   the other rated at 11 kW to represent a diesel generator, an 8 kW pulsed
   power load that represents the discharge and charge of a capacitor bank
   for an electromagnetic railgun system, and 37 kW ship propulsion system
   comprised of an induction motor coupled to the propeller shaft. The ship
   propulsion system's induction motor has switched operation with two
   modes of operation, propelling and generating; the latter mode means
   that excess kinetic energy during ship slowing can be used to charge the
   capacitor bank for loads such as pulsed power loads. Given the switched
   system model, the paper sets forth a hybrid model predictive control
   strategy based on a minimization of a performance index that trades off
   fuel consumption, velocity tracking error, and electrical bus voltage
   error. The optimization is performed using a relaxed representation of
   the control problem (termed the embedding method) and collocation for
   discretization with traditional numerical programming to compute the
   mode and continuous control inputs. The methodology avoids the
   computational complexity associated with alternative approaches, e.g.,
   mixed-integer programming. Numerical optimization is performed with
   MATLAB's sqpLineSearch. To demonstrate the power management approach, a
   scenario is simulated where the ship is to follow a changing desired
   velocity while simultaneously maintaining the bus voltage at a desired
   value, keeping the 11 kW generator at a fuel efficient operating point,

Abstract = {{Frost susceptible soils in both seasonal freezing and permafrost regions
   are vulnerable to frost action and may experience large displacements
   upon extreme temperature changes. Frost heave and strengthening occurs
   as the soil freezes, whereas settlement and thaw weakening is expected
   during the melting process. As a result, significant damage to
   infrastructure built in these regions can be caused by large thermally
   induced deformation of soils. Therefore, accounting for soil behavior
   upon freezing and thawing is of great importance. In this paper, a
   Thermal-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) framework is used, in which a temperature
   dependent elastic-plastic constitutive relationship and porosity rate
   function (for ice lens formation) are included. The model is implemented
   into an FE system and then calibrated. A chilled gas pipeline buried in
   a seasonally freezing soil is simulated. The simulation results are
   reasonable and the model appears to be a good tool in dealing with
   problems associated with frost action.}},

Abstract = {{The building sector accounts for nearly 41\% of U.S. primary energy use.
   Various tools have been developed for estimating the embodied energy
   during the design and construction phase of a building. However, there
   is a lack of a comprehensive mechanism which can measure and control the
   energy flow occurring during the operation phase of a building. Loss of
   efficiency of building systems and deterioration of various building
   components can collectively reduce the performance of a building, which
   eventually results in more energy flow into a building in the form of
   more maintenance and replacement requirements, as well as, increased
   operational energy demand. This research analyses a building's
   deterioration mechanism and presents a system dynamics simulation based
   `` Life Cycle Energy Framework{''} that couples material performance and
   energy simulation to arrive at an optimal maintenance and replacement
   cycle for major materials over the entire operation period of a
   building. The case study results indicate that the proposed framework
   can help various building stakeholders in understanding and limiting the
   energy usage of the building from the design phase until the end of life
   phase. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Policies aimed at reducing building energy use have often resulted in
   inefficiencies due to their higher costs, requirements to comply with
   regulations, incentives, and/or sanctions; and neglecting the impact of
   occupants on building energy use. To overcome these challenges, energy
   policy measures can be designed and implemented by identifying
   occupants' behavior that significantly impact building energy use and
   relevant factors that may lead to sustainable behavior pattern.
   Therefore, this study presents a conceptual framework that proposes a
   multi-level intervention strategy that is tailored to varying occupants'
   characteristics to produce and maintain energy use reduction in
   buildings over time. The framework is designed in two main steps: (1)
   identifying the occupants' energy use and behavioral characteristics
   before and after the exposure of any energy efficiency intervention
   (e.g., education, persuasion); and (2) delivering targeted occupancy
   interventions based on occupants' energy use and behavioral
   characteristics. This framework will assist decision-makers in
   formulating and designing effective energy policy tools at lower costs
   to deliver occupancy-focused interventions for reducing building energy
   use. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The TST is a 0.9mx0.9m backlit tilting surface upon which coarse sand
   and gravel particles are spread out prior to image capture by a
   ceiling-mounted camera. The function of the TST is to somewhat segregate
   the particles by size so that small particles cannot be hidden from
   camera view behind larger ones. A method called watershed segmentation
   digitally detaches the particles thus eliminating the laborious task of
   physically separating the particles. Early TST test results were
   promising but did not perfectly match sieve results because the camera
   captured only two-dimensional particle projections. The third (vertical)
   dimension was only estimated. The problem has been overcome through
   stereophotography. This paper details the new three-dimensional TST
   (3D-TST) test and compares results to two-dimensional TST tests and to
   sieving. Distributions of particle shapes for large statistically valid
   numbers of particles are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{We are becoming increasingly surrounded by smart and connected devices,
   popularly known as the Internet of Things. The emerging user interface
   paradigm for many such things eschews physical buttons, knobs, and
   displays in favor of virtual interfaces that are downloaded from the web
   and rendered on remote platforms-like smartphones. However, such
   smartphone app-based interfaces often require tedious discovery and
   installation, as well as device discovery, pairing, and configuration
   before a user can interact with a nearby device. Requiring an explicit
   app install for each new device type scales poorly with device growth,
   and particularly hinders casual interactions with ambient devices.
   Instead of the high-friction, walled-garden approach now taking root, we
   propose Summon, a physical web browser that provides a seamless,
   scalable approach to browsing and interacting with nearby things. Summon
   leverages multiple network patterns and modern web technologies to
   provide users with rich device interfaces, even for devices under
   network or power constraints. We argue that this approach scales better
   and that it provides more intuitive and natural functionality for both
   users and developers. This demo presents the basic concept, allows
   others to experience our preliminary implementation, and raises several
   open research questions.}},

   a gateway, four hardware building blocks, multiple sensor platforms, an
   indoor localization system, and software for connecting users and
   devices. Each piece plays an integral role towards enabling
   applications, from facilitating rapid development of wireless smart
   devices to composing data streams and services from a diverse set of
   components. By providing layered interoperable systems, our toolkit
   offers cohesive support for moving beyond single-device, cloud-centric
   applications-typical in today's IoT landscape-and towards richer
   applications that incorporate multiple data streams, human interaction,
   cloud processing, location awareness, multiple communication protocols,
   historical data, access control, and on-demand user interfaces. To show
   how the pieces in the toolkit cooperate, we demonstrate a location-based
   access control application where a user's smartphone can control a
   room's lighting, but only from within the room. Further, data streams
   from the phone and nearby sensors are used to provide a constant
   lighting service which attempts to maintain a user-set brightness under
   variable external lighting conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a temporal segmentation and classification method that
   accounts for transition patterns between events of interest. We apply
   this method to automatically detect salient human action events from
   videos. A discriminative classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machine) is
   used to recognize human action events and an efficient dynamic
   programming algorithm is used to jointly determine the starting and
   ending temporal segments of recognized human actions. The key difference
   from previous work is that we introduce the modeling of two kinds of
   event transition information, namely event transition segments, which
   capture the occurrence patterns between two consecutive events of
   interest, and event transition probabilities, which model the transition
   probability between the two events. Experimental results show that our
   approach significantly improves the segmentation and recognition
   performance for the two datasets we tested, in which distinctive
   transition patterns between events exist.}},

   union of subspaces model is useful, it is also reasonable to assume you
   have access to a small number of labels. In this paper we investigate
   the benefit labeled data brings to the subspace clustering problem. We
   focus on incorporating labels into the k-subspaces algorithm, a simple
   and computationally efficient alternating estimation algorithm. We find
   that even a very small number of randomly selected labels can greatly
   improve accuracy over the unsupervised approach. We demonstrate that
   with enough labels, we get a significant improvement by using actively
   selected labels chosen for points that are nearly equidistant to more
   than one estimated subspace. We show this improvement on simulated data

Abstract = {{The rise of the mobile-cloud computing paradigm in recent years has
   enabled mobile devices with processing power and battery life
   limitations to achieve complex tasks in real-time. While mobile-cloud
   computing is promising to overcome the limitations of mobile devices for
   real-time computing, the lack of frameworks compatible with standard
   technologies and techniques for dynamic performance estimation and
   program component relocation makes it harder to adopt mobile-cloud
   computing at large. Most of the available frameworks rely on strong
   assumptions such as the availability of a full clone of the application
   code and negligible execution time in the cloud. In this paper, we
   present a dynamic computation offloading model for mobile-cloud
   computing, based on autonomous agents. Our approach does not impose any
   requirements on the cloud platform other than providing isolated
   execution containers, and it alleviates the management burden of
   offloaded code by the mobile platform using stateful, autonomous
   application partitions. We also investigate the effects of different
   cloud runtime environment conditions on the performance of mobile-cloud
   computing, and present a simple and low-overhead dynamic makespan
   estimation model integrated into autonomous agents to enhance them with
   self-performance evaluation in addition to self-cloning capabilities.
   The proposed performance profiling model is used in conjunction with a
   cloud resource optimization scheme to ensure optimal performance.
   Experiments with two mobile applications demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed approach for high-performance mobile-cloud computing.}},

   micro-optofluidic ring resonator (mu OFRR) sensors with other
   microfabricated components to yield a microsystem capable of performing
   comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography (mu GC x mu GC) is
   described. Two CRs with different monolayer protected Au nanoparticle
   (MPN) interface layers were tested along with one ae OFRR with a PDMS
   interface layer. All three provided modulation numbers similar to those
   of a reference flame ionization detector (FID). Modulated peak widths
   (full width at half maximum, fwhm) for the CR detectors ranged from 0.31
   to 1.9 sec, and those for the mu OFRR ranged from 0.24 to 1.2 sec.
   Although these fwhm values were greater than those from the FID and they
   increased with the vapor pressure of the analyte, most were < 1 sec and
   all peaks were narrow enough to permit efficient mu GC x mu GC
   separations. Analyses of mixtures of 6-18 volatile organic compounds are
   demonstrated.}},

   We show that the electromagnetic energy dissipated in the anharmonic

   commonly used piezoelectric materials sets a limit for the resonator Q
   that is frequency independent and is much smaller than the Akheiser Q
   limit at frequencies less than 1 GHz. To validate this theory, the Q
   limit is formulated for extensional bulk acoustic modes with in-plane

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel phonon traps, the main building blocks of
   self-sustained all-GaN oscillators, implemented on an AlGaN/GaN
   electro-acoustic platform. The geometry of acoustic cavities has been
   engineered to efficiently trap the energy in the central region of
   devices, where the interdigitated excitation/sense electrodes and HEMT
   read-outs are located. Such an energy trapping method obviates the need
   for narrow tethers. This facilitates routing of multiple lines connected
   to the source, gate, and drain of the read-out HEMTs as well as allowing
   co-integration of different interdigitated transducer (IDT) sets for
   efficient piezoelectric lateral field excitation. Furthermore,
   elimination of narrow tethers improves the power handling capability of
   the GaN resonators, making them suitable for high-power applications.
   Two types of AlGaN/GaN-based devices are discussed in this work, both
   operating in the ninth-order width-extensional mode that is excited
   using Schottky IDTs. In the first device, another set of Schottky IDTs
   it used for sensing, while the second device utilizes a HEMT to read-out
   the signal. An unloaded quality factor (Q) of similar to 13,000 has been
   measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure for a device
   operating at similar to 740 MHz, resulting in a frequency x Q value of
   0.96x10(13), which is the highest value reported to date for GaN-based
   resonators and is very close to the intrinsic limits for AlN and GaN,
   set by phonon-phonon interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The splitting rate model proposed by Smith and Mounce (2011) establishes
   a traffic evolution process on a link-node network representation, which
   overcomes the difficulties in applying traditional path-based models and
   provides the ease of implementing controls at nodes. While their model
   offers a new method for modeling traffic evolution, it contains an
   ad-hoc step of flow adjustment to preserve the flow conservation. This
   flow adjustment step leads to difficulties in analyzing the system
   properties. This paper proposes a generalized flow splitting model for
   day-to-day traffic assignment based on the concept of splitting flow at
   nodes. The proposed model preserves the flow conservation endogenously
   by introducing the inflow variable into the formulation. The generalized
   formulation provides the ease to construct a variety of day-to-day
   traffic assignment models, and serves as a framework for analyzing the
   models' properties, such as the invariance property and the preservation
   of the Lipschitz continuity and strong monotonicity. Specifically, a
   proportional-adjustment model and a projection-type model are developed
   based on the proposed generalized formulation. A numerical example
   demonstrates the ease of implementing the proposed generalized model, as
   well as its convergence to user equilibrium. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Current operating system designs require applications (apps) to
   implicitly place trust in a large amount of code. Taking Android as an
   example, apps must trust both the kernel as well as privileged userspace
   services that consist of hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Malware
   apps, on the other hand, aim to exploit any vulnerabilities in the above
   large trusted base to escalate their privileges. Once malware escalates
   its privileges, additional attacks become feasible, such as stealing
   credentials by scanning memory pages or intercepting user interactions
   of sensitive apps, e.g., those used for banking or health management.
   This paper introduces a novel mechanism, called Anception, that
   strategically deprivileges a significant portion of the kernel and
   system services, moving them to an untrusted container, thereby
   significantly reducing the attack surface for privilege escalation
   available to malware. Anception supports unmodified apps, running on a
   modified Android kernel. It achieves performance close to native Android
   on several popular macrobenchmarks and provides security against many
   types of known Android root exploits.}},

   management system, responsible for providing the necessary power
   efficiently from batteries to electric motors while maintaining the
   batteries within an operational region. Because the discharge-rate and
   temperature affect battery health and efficiency significantly,
   batteries should be managed to mitigate their discharge and thermal
   stresses.
   In this paper, we develop a real-time, efficient integrated system for
   managing the discharge-rate and temperature of batteries. To achieve
   this objective, we first construct a prognosis system predicting the
   likely states of batteries' capacity and capability. Based on the
   prognostic estimation of the impact of the temperature and
   discharge-rate on the performance, we solve an optimization problem to
   search for efficient discharging and cooling scheduling. Our
   experimentation and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
   management enhances system performance up to 85.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to develop an integrated mobile sensing system
   that enhances Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to provide an autonomous
   means of locating and mapping damage characteristics of a structural
   system. The UAV brings mobility to the integrated sensor payload so that
   the sensors can access remote sites and collect data of structures and
   field features following an earthquake or a natural disaster. A light
   detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor and high resolution camera are
   installed on a UAV to obtain highly detailed and accurate topological
   maps of physical surfaces from which structural cracks, surface chances
   and minor faulting can be detected. One of the challenges in automating
   the operation of the UAV in challenging operational environments such as
   GPS-denied environments (e. g., under bridges, indoor environments) is
   accurate navigation. In a GPS-denied environment, localization relies on
   on-board sensors, which has limited accuracy when positioning the UAV in
   a fixed coordinate system. This paper explores solutions to this problem
   with vision-and marker-based localization methods. The experimental
   results are based on a LiDAR and camera payload integrated with an
   octo-rotor UAV platform that has an onboard inertial measurement unit.
   The experimental results show that three dimensional navigation and
   geometric mapping in unknown operational environments are both feasible
   and accurate.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation is a common way to analyze the performance of a manufacturing
   system. On a system level, entities are modeled based on production and
   failure rates using Discrete Event Simulation (DES). On a machine level,
   the Continuous Dynamics (CD) of machines are studied based on position,
   velocity, and acceleration. However, these models are usually run
   separately, losing key information that could be used for more accurate
   control of the system performance. In this paper, we merge DES and CD in
   a single hybrid simulation environment. By synchronizing the simulations
   to run in real-time, the results can be compared with information from
   the plant floor. Using the simulation outcome as a reference, any
   significant deviation of the plant floor performance would represent an
   error and would trigger an event that can be automated or inform an
   operator of a required action.}},

   primary inputs. The proposed method can work with any microscopic
   vehicle model that uses vehicle trajectories as inputs and gives related
   emission rates as outputs. Furthermore, a constrained eco-routing
   problem is proposed to deal with the situation where multiple costs
   present. This is done by transferring the original MDP based formulation
   to a linear programming formulation. Besides the primary cost,
   additional costs are considered as constraints. Two numerical examples
   are given using the field data obtained from City of Pasadena,
   California, USA. The eco-routing algorithm for single objective is
   compared against the traditional shortest path algorithm, Dijkstra's
   algorithm. Average reductions of CO emission around 20\% are observed.

Abstract = {{Reverse osmosis (RO) is one of the main technologies for water
   desalination, which can be used in locations with water resources that
   have high salinity content (such as saline ground water or seawater) to
   produce fresh water. Energy requirement for RO is less than other
   desalination processes, but is in the form of electric power, which can
   be scarce as fresh water in in remote areas not connected to the grid.
   Fortunately, many areas with fresh water shortage due to lack of
   rainfall have abundant sunshine. The combination of solar power and RO
   desalination is attractive, but remote areas usually requires small
   modular units, which favors photovoltaic (PV) solar energy harvesting.
   It is important to consider the net cost-effectiveness of the system
   when designing the PV-RO desalination plant. Adding battery storage to a
   PV-RO system has the advantage of steadier operation, but is an
   additional cost whose real benefit is only realized with a larger PV
   array that can harvest more energy during daytime. This paper compares
   the net unit cost of fresh water for realistic scenarios of PV-RO
   systems with and without battery storage. A multi-level optimization
   approach previously developed by the authors for time-variant power
   PV-RO systems is adopted; a ``sub-loop{''} optimization determines the
   operating pressure and flow rate given a fixed system configuration and
   instantaneous power input, while an ``outer loop{''} optimizes the
   configuration of the desalination plant. The sub-loop optimization is
   done via an enumeration approach, while the outer loop is optimized via
   a mixed real-coded genetic algorithm (GA). A demonstration study shows a
   batteryless system being approx. 30\% more expensive per unit fresh
   water production than a fully optimized battery-backed system. However,
   most of the cost of a batteryless system is in initial investment, which
   with 7\% less annual operating cost, can present a plausible design
   choice for remote areas.}},

Abstract = {{This paper lays the grounds for a new methodology for detecting thermal
   discomfort, which can potentially reduce the building energy usage while
   improving the comfort of its inhabitants. The paper describes our
   explorations in automatic human discomfort prediction using
   physiological signals directly collected from a buildings inhabitants.
   Using infrared thermography, as well as several other bio-sensors
   (galvanic skin response, heart rate tracker, respiration rate tracker),
   we record a building's inhabitants under various thermal conditions
   (hot, cold, neutral), and consequently build a multimodal model that can
   automatically detect thermal discomfort.
   The paper makes two important contributions. First, we introduce a novel
   dataset, consisting of sensorial measurements of human behavior under
   varied comfort/discomfort conditions. The change in physiological
   signals of the human body are monitored for several subjects, for
   different comfort levels in an indoor environment. Second, using the
   dataset obtained in the first step, we build a model that identifies the
   relatiOnship between human factors, as tracked through infrared
   thermography and other bio-sensors, and environmental conditions related
   to discomfort. Third, we measure the correlation between sensorial
   measurements collected from the user and self-reported levels of
   discomfort, and hence identify the sensorial measurements that are
   predictive of human discomfort. The final goal is to automatically
   predict the level of discomfort of a building inhabitant without any
   explicit input from the user.
   This human-centered discomfort prediction model is expected to enable
   innovative adaptive control scenarios for a built environment conditions
   in real time, as well as a significant reduction in building energy
   usage directly related to human occupancy and their desired comfort
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, stress and strain. distributions near a crack tip in a
   round compact tension specimen of elastic-plastic materials are obtained
   by finite element analyses. The strain distributions are used to explore
   the use of the crack tip strain distributions for crack growth rate
   models due to stress corrosion cracking in unirradiated and irradiated
   steels with different yield stresses and hardening behaviors. Both
   power-law hardening and perfectly plastic materials are considered. The
   computational results indicate that the critical radial distance to the
   tip based on the crack tip opening displacement is outside of the
   Hutchinson-Rice-Rosengren (HRR) dominant zone for power law hardening
   materials in a round compact tension specimen under the stress intensity
   factor typically considered for stress corrosion cracking. For both the
   power-law hardening and perfectly plastic materials, the computational
   results show that the strain distributions are different from those of
   the analytical solutions for the range of the radial distance larger
   than the critical radial distance based on the crack opening
   displacement within the plastic zones. The computational results suggest
   that for the stress intensity factor typically considered for stress

   estimate the strain rate for developing crack growth rate models to

Abstract = {{As demonstrated in a recent comprehensive study on construction of
   full-field residual stress profiles for fitness-for-service assessment
   of pressure vessel and piping components, a reasonable estimate of
   welding-induced plastic zone size is necessary for introducing a shell
   theory based solution form (Song et al, 2015 {[}1-2]). This paper
   presents an analytical method for estimating plastic zone size by first
   solving an equivalent one dimensional heat transfer problem in which
   weld zone is represented by a line segment with initial temperature at
   melting. Thermoplasticity conditions are then imposed by assuming
   elastic perfectly plastic behaviors. Finally, an analytical expression
   is obtained to relate plastic zone boundary to maximum temperature field
   distribution experienced by material points within the whole domain over
   the entire heating and cooling history. The solution can be further
   expressed by a rather simple form with the identification of a
   characteristic length parameter that signifies inflection point of
   temperature distribution. So estimated plastic zone sizes for various
   welded joint types have been compared with finite element residual
   stress analysis results in which sequentially coupled welding heat
   transfer and thermo-mechanical analysis procedures are used. A good
   agreement has been achieved for all cases analyzed.
   Compared with conventional finite element residual stress analysis
   procedures, this method offers significant simplicity and efficiency,
   while being reasonably accurate, particularly for applications in
   residual stress profile estimation and in evaluation of welding induced
   distortions in complex structures.}},

Abstract = {{A recent comprehensive investigation into residual stress distributions
   in pipe and vessel longitudinal seam welds is presented in this paper,

   component radius to wall thickness ratio from 2 to 10, and linear
   welding heating input from low (50 J/mm) to high (6000 J/mm). Through
   the use of a residual stress decomposition technique, two key parameters
   that govern through-thickness residual stress distributions in terms of

   component radius to wall thickness ratio (r/t) and the other is a
   characteristic heat input density ((Q) over cap) having a unit of

Abstract = {{Welding residual stress simulation using finite element analysis has
   become increasingly common in supporting fitness-for-service assessment.
   Two dimensional (2D) cross-section models, such as using generalized
   plane strain assumptions for linear welds in plate structures and
   axisymmetric assumptions for piping and vessel girth welds are typically
   used due to their computational efficiency and simplicity in data
   reduction process, especially for performing a large amount of
   parametric analyses. However, there seem no consistent procedures in
   place for translating actual weld linear heat input used in practice to
   a 2D cross-section model in which heat loss in welding travel direction
   is unaccounted for, often resulting in overheating to a significant
   degree if actual welding heat input is used.
   This paper starts with the introduction of a two-part analytical linear
   heat input representation for a simplified 2D weld residual stress
   modeling procedure in which weld metal is deposited at a preset
   temperature such as melting with a hold time. The first part is based on
   a simple thermodynamics concept, which describes the heat required for
   elevating a weld pass from room temperature to deposition temperature.
   The second part is based on an equivalent transient heat transfer
   solution that measures the amount of heat needed to sustain deposit
   temperature during hold time. With this proposed method, linear heat
   input involved in a 2D residual stress model can be inferred for
   relating to actual welding conditions, typically specified in terms of
   current, voltage, and welding speed. By the same token, for a given set
   of welding parameters, welding heat flow modeling procedure involved in
   a 2D FE residual stress model can be consistently defined in terms of
   deposit temperature and hold time. A number of validation case studies
   are presented and the results have showed that the proposed procedure
   provides an effective means for inter-relating actual welding linear
   heat input and heat content associated with 2D residual stress models.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate estimation of extreme responses for offshore platforms and
   supply vessels is critical to the design process. Long time Monte
   Carlo-type simulations can theoretically capture extreme responses, but
   this type of simulation is not feasible in the early design process due
   to the extreme computational expense. An alternative is to use shorter
   simulations that are tailored to create statistically equivalent extreme
   responses. The latter requires judicious specification of expected
   extreme sea conditions.
   Extreme responses can be estimated using a variety of processes,
   including the Design Loads Generator (DLG). Assuming a vessel response
   is Gaussian, stationary, and ergodic, a given response can be
   approximated as a sum of Fourier amplitudes with random phase angles.
   The DLG is a process that can calculate innumerable sets of random phase
   angles that result in a given extreme response or design event. Using
   linear-systems theory, the corresponding incident-wave phase angles are
   calculated from the response phase angles and the incident-wave-train
   profile is determined.
   A fundamental question that must be answered is how can a nonlinear
   seaway that produces an extreme event be described such that a wave
   maker or numerical wave boundary condition be controlled to recreate the
   nonlinear and extreme seaway. A common practice employs linear wave
   theory to shift the design event in space and time. The shifted phase
   angles can then be used to drive a wavemaker with the intent of
   producing the desired wave train at a given point. However,
   nonlinearities in wave propagation result in an inaccurately generated
   design wave train. This paper focuses on the role of wave nonlinearity
   in the evolution of the wave system and how this can be accounted for in
   the control of a physical or virtual wave maker.}},

Abstract = {{This paper takes a novel approach to the design of planing craft with
   active control systems (ACS) by co-designing the longitudinal center of
   gravity (lcg) and ACS, and compares its performance with a vessel where
   the lcg and ACS are designed sequentially (traditional approach). The
   vessels investigated are prismatic in shape. The ACS are modeled as
   forces on the vessel. The ACS controller is a Linear Quadratic Regulator
   designed using a reduced order model of the vessel. In the design, only
   the calm water drag is optimized. The simulated co-designed vessel had
   10\% lower calm water and mean seaway drag than the sequentially
   designed vessel. However, the co-designed vessel's seakeeping was poorer
   vertical acceleration doses 25\% higher. Results indicate that the
   traditional sequential design approach does not fully exploit the
   synergy between a planing craft and its ACS; as a first step, the
   stability constraints should be relaxed in the design exploration.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we address the development of the velocity decomposition
   algorithm, a numerical flow solution method that incorporates both
   velocity potential and Navier-Stokes-based solution procedures. The
   motivation for this is so that the field discretization required by the
   Navier-Stokes solver can be reduced to the region of the flow domain in
   which the flow is vortical. Specific advantages are that the
   computational cost is reduced, it is easier to discretize the flow
   domain, and difficult problems such as the simulation of ships
   maneuvering in a seaway are closer to being within reach. The target
   applications are broad, ranging from vortex shedding on bluff objects
   such as risers, to the wave induced loads on a platform in a current and
   irregular seas. In previous work, the algorithm has been successfully
   applied to address steady flows of 3-D non-lifting bodies without water
   waves, or 2-D bodies that can have lift and be near a water surface. In
   this paper, the velocity decomposition approach is extended to
   numerically solve for the unsteady flow of single-phase viscous flows.
   The velocity vector is decomposed into irrotational and vortical
   components. A boundary element method is used to solve for the
   irrotational component (designated as the viscous potential) by applying
   a viscous boundary condition to the body boundary. A field method is
   used to solve for the total velocity on a reduced domain where the flow
   is vortical. The new algorithm investigates two approaches to solve the
   unsteady problem based on different types of time-dependence exhibited
   by the solution. The unsteady velocity decomposition method is
   demonstrated on two cases, and the solutions are compared to those
   generated by a conventional viscous flow solver. The results by the new
   algorithm agree well with the benchmark solutions and exhibit a
   reduction in time.}},

Abstract = {{The research objective of the Marine Renewable Energy Lab (MRELab) is to
   design multi-cylinder VIVACE Converters and optimize their power output
   for a broad range of velocities. For a given geometric and mass
   configuration of a school of cylinders, each point on the power
   envelope, at a given flow-speed, is a function of the spring constant
   and damping. Conducting tests with real springs and dampers requires
   lengthy preparation for each set of experiments. A more efficient way to
   conduct experiments faster and accurately is developed based on a
   controller embedded virtual spring damping system (V-ck) that des not
   include the hydrodynamic force in the closed loop. Each oscillator
   consists of one V-ck, one interchangeable cylinder moving on submerged
   roller blocks and driven by the fluid flow, and connected to the
   controller through belts and pulleys. It is designed to achieve the
   desired static/dynamic friction through the V-ck. An Arduino embedded
   board controls a servomotor with an optical encoder, which enables
   real-time position/speed measurement. A system identification (SI)
   methodology is developed making possible to identify the damping model
   of any oscillator, which is typically much more complicated than the
   classical linear viscous model. Upon completion of the SI process for an
   oscillator, the actual nonlinear damping model is subtracted using the
   controller and leaving the system with zero damping. Then, a
   mathematically linear damping model is added, thus, resulting in a
   system with real linear viscous damping. This process enables changing
   the spring constant and harnessing damping through the controller
   instantly. Experiments are then conducted with both real spring dampers
   and V-ck to validate the process. All FIM experiments are conducted in
   the Low Turbulence Free Surface Water Channel of the University of
   Michigan at 16,000<Re<140,000.
   The main findings are: (a) The V-ck system was developed keeping the
   hydrodynamic force out of the control loop and, thus, not biasing the
   FIM. (b) The agreement between real and virtual springs and dampers was
   excellent in FIM measurements over the entire range of spring constants
   and velocities tested. (c) The lag due to the controller was minimal and
   significantly reduced compared to the first generation of V-ck built in
   the MRELab.}},

   model at Reynolds numbers (30,000 <= Re <= 120,000, 5.50 <= U{*}<= 9.85)
   in the TrSL3 flow regime. Computational results compare very well with
   experimental data. With implementation of Passive Turbulence Control
   (PTC), the VIVACE Converter can harness hydrokinetic energy from
   currents or tides over an expanded range of FIM synchronization,
   including Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) and galloping. The General
   Grid Interface (GGI) with topological mesh changes is proved to be an
   effective method for handling high-amplitude FIM response. Within the
   test Reynolds number range, five regions are clearly observed, including
   the no-FIM range, the VW initial branch, the VIV upper branch,
   transition from VIV to galloping, and galloping. The power envelope
   calculated based on the CDF simulations for FIM agrees very well with
   the corresponding power envelope generated based on experiments. The

Abstract = {{A simplified architecture for a scalable phased array is proposed. In
   this design, a new technique for steering the array's beam has been
   devised. The proposed technique integrates the phase shift function into
   array's feed network and significantly reduces the required number of
   phase shifters in phased array. Phase shifters are responsible for a
   great portion of the complexity, size, and cost of phased arrays.
   Therefore, reducing their number allows for less complexity and cost. As

Abstract = {{A probabilistic quorum system (PQS) allows distributed services to be
   replicated on only a subset (quorum) of servers. The replicas can be
   kept consistent with high levels of assurance as long as any two quorums
   intersect with very high probability. PQS thus provides a means to trade
   off levels of consistency against the scalability and efficiency of a
   quorum system. When quorums are constructed by choosing members of the
   subset uniformly at random, the nonintersection probability can be
   easily computed. On a distributed system with n servers, uniform
   sampling is often conducted using random walk of length O(log n). To
   collect multiple uniform samples naively would require as many random
   walks. A number of works have relied on analytical results based on the
   Chernoff bound to reduce the number of random walks needed to collect
   multiple samples. Controlled flooding is another efficient method to
   collect multiple samples. In this paper we evaluate both methods
   analytically and found that quorums formed using either method cannot
   satisfy the nonintersection probability bound associated with quorum
   formed by uniform sampling. Our contributions are: (1) to show that
   overlay topology can be constructed to cache multiple random walks, (2)
   to show that repeated use of this cache to obtain multiple uniform
   samples leads to degradation of sample uniformity over time, and (3) to
   propose and evaluate graph re-wiring as a simple method to keep the
   cache fresh, to take advantage of overhead reduction of random walk
   caching while alleviating the degradation in sample uniformity.}},

Abstract = {{We have discovered two main problems when a multicast sender and
   multicast receivers are associated with the same AP. First, the
   multicast sender cannot determine a proper sending rate with the
   traditional end-to-end rate-adaptation schemes. Second, the multicast
   sender wastes its power due to the unique characteristics of power
   saving mode of the IEEE 802.11 standard. We propose efficient multicast
   streaming (EMS) to solve these problems without modifying the AP and the
   multicast receivers. With EMS, the multicast sender adapts its sending
   rate at the application layer and adjusts the sleep cycle at the MAC
   layer by monitoring multicast packets sent from the AP. Our
   experimentation and simulation results show that EMS can improve video
   quality at the receivers and reduce power consumption of the multicast
   sender significantly.}},

Abstract = {{A novel isolated bi-directional soft-switched high-frequency-AC (HFAC)
   link DC-AC converter using SiC MOSFET and IGBT hybrid switches is
   presented in this paper. The DC-AC converter is composed of a
   full-bridge (FB) inverter cascaded with a cycloconverter through a
   high-frequency transformer. In order to increase the converter
   efficiency, and to push the transformer frequency to 50-100 kHz, SiC
   MOSFETs are preferable devices compared to the traditional IGBTs or
   SCRs. A unipolar-SPWM-oriented modulation technique is proposed to
   realize zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) for FB and zero-current-switching
   (ZCS) for cycloconverter, and to suppress the voltage spikes introduced
   by the transformer leakage inductance as well. With the novel modulation
   technique, half of the AC switches in the cycloconverter work under
   transformer frequency and the rest work at line frequency (60 Hz).
   Therefore a SiC-IGBT hybrid switch structure is proposed for the
   cycloconverter. Simulation model and a 400 VDC to 240 VAC, 3 kW
   prototype have been developed to validate the effectiveness and
   performance of the proposed unipolar soft-switching modulation technique
   and the hybrid switch structure.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, programmers and software tools have focused on mapping a
   single data-parallel kernel onto a heterogeneous computing system
   consisting of multiple general-purpose processors (CPUS) and graphics
   processing units (GPUs). These methodologies break down as application
   complexity grows to contain multiple communicating data-parallel
   kernels. This paper introduces MKMD, an automatic system for mapping
   multiple kernels across multiple computing devices in a seamless manner.
   MKMD is a two phased approach that combines coarse grain scheduling of
   indivisible kernels followed by opportunistic fine-grained
   workgroup-level partitioning to exploit idle resources. During this
   process, MKMD considers kernel dependencies and the underlying systems
   along with the execution time model built with a few sets of profile
   data. With the scheduling decision, MKMD transparently manages the order
   of executions and data transfers for each device. On a real machine with
   one CPU and two different GPUs, MKMD achieves a mean speedup of 1.89x
   compared to the in-order execution on the fastest device for a set of
   applications with multiple kernels. 53\% of this speedup comes from the
   coarse-grained scheduling and the other 47\% is the result of the
   fine-grained partitioning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the effectiveness of different knobs to dynamically
   trade energy consumption with output quality in approximate SRAMs for
   error-tolerant applications (such as video). Leveraging the different
   impact of errors on quality at most significant bit (MSB) and least
   significant bit (LSB) positions, energy savings higher than those
   provided by simple voltage scaling are enabled. Firstly, a comparison of
   two techniques, dual-V-DD and LSB dropping, is carried out showing that
   the latter is preferable thanks to its intrinsic simplicity and more
   pronounced energy savings. Secondly, a selective Error Correction Code
   (ECC) technique which reuses the LSBs as check bits to protect MSBs is
   investigated. Measurements on a 28nm CMOS 32kb SRAM show that bit
   dropping and bit reuse achieve an energy reduction of up to 33\% and
   28\%, compared to simple voltage scaling at iso-quality. When combined
   together, the two techniques achieve a better energy saving (40\%) and a
   supply voltage reduction of about 100mV at iso-quality. Finally,
   guidelines to select the energy-optimal combination of the two
   techniques are provided for a given quality target.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of tandem spacing on the flow induced motions (FIM) of two

   two-dimensional Unsteady Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes equations with
   the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. Results are compared to
   experiments in the range of Reynolds number of 30,000<Re<100,000. The
   center to-center spacing between the two cylinders is varied from 2 to 6
   diameters. Simulation results predict well all ranges of FIM including
   VIV and galloping and match well with experimental measurements. For the
   upstream cylinder, the amplitude and frequency responses are not
   considerably influenced by the downstream cylinder when the spacing is
   greater than 2D. For the downstream cylinder, a rising amplitude trend
   in the VIV upper branch can be observed in all cases as is typical of
   flows in the TrSL3 regime. The galloping branch merges with the VIV
   upper branch for spacing greater than 3D. Vortex structures show
   significant variation in different flow regimes in accordance with
   experimental observations. High-resolution post-processing shows that
   the interaction between the wakes of cylinders result in various types

Abstract = {{In the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory (MRELab) of the University of
   Michigan, Flow Induced Motion (FEVI) is studied as a means to convert
   marine hydrokinetic energy to electricity using the VIVACE energy
   harvester {[}1-4]. Turbulence stimulation in the form of sand-strips,
   referred to as Passive Turbulence Control (PTC), were added to
   oscillating cylinders in 2008 {[}5]. PTC enabled VIVACE to harness
   hydrokinetic energy from currents/tides over the entire range of FIM
   including VIV and galloping. In 2011, the MRELab produced experimentally
   the PTC-to-FIM Map defining the induced cylinder motion based on the
   location of PTC {[}6]. In 2013, the robustness of the map was tested and
   dominant zones were identified {[}7]. Even though the PTC-to-FIM Map has
   become a powerful tool in inducing specific motions of circular
   cylinders, several parameters remain unexplored. Experiments, though the
   ultimate verification tool, are time consuming and hard to provide all
   needed information. A computational tool that could predict the FIM of a
   cylinder correctly would be invaluable to study the full parametric
   design space. A major side-benefit of PTC was the fact that PTC enabled
   computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations to generate results in
   good agreement with experiments by forcing the location of the
   separation point {[}8]. This valuable tool, along with experiments, is
   used in this paper to investigate PTC design parameters such as width
   and thickness and their impact on flow features with the intent of
   maximizing FIM and, thus, hydrokinetic energy conversion.}},

Abstract = {{Keyword detection is typically used as a front-end to trigger automatic
   speech recognition and spoken dialog systems. The detection engine needs
   to be continuously listening, which has strong implications on power and
   memory consumption. In this paper, we devise a neural network
   architecture for keyword detection and present a set of techniques for
   reducing the memory requirements in order to make the architecture
   suitable for resource constrained hardware. Specifically, a fixed-point
   implementation is considered; aggressively scaling down the precision of
   the weights lowers the memory compared to a naive floating-point
   implementation. For further optimization, a node pruning technique is
   proposed to identify and remove the least active nodes in a neural
   network. Experiments are conducted over 10 keywords selected from the
   Resource Management (RM) database. The trade- off between detection
   performance and memory is assessed for different weight representations.
   We show that a neural network with as few as 5 bits per weight yields a
   marginal and acceptable loss in performance, while requiring only 200
   kilobytes (KB) of on-board memory and a latency of 150 ms. A hardware
   architecture using a single multiplier and a power consumption of less
   than 10 mW is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an Android mobile phone application demonstrating
   methods for implementing or assisting traditional speech therapy
   techniques using mobile devices. Namely, the paper will present the
   theory behind the treatment, specific techniques for implementing this
   in an Android device, and results from testing. The techniques are
   principally aimed at treating Parkinson's-disease induced hypophonia and
   habit-induced hyperphonia, but are applicable to other speech or
   language disorders, particularly vocal projection issues. The software
   uses therapist-supplied volume limitations and provides visual and aural
   feedback to indicate needed improvements. The application can be used
   with normal speech or while performing a speech therapy exercise from a
   standardized text, while logging session data in a format allowing the
   therapist to identify which portions of the exercise the patient is
   struggling with. In order to implement this as a viable medical device,
   the following requirements should be kept in mind:
   Rapidness of feedback
   Ease and pleasantness of use for even tech-averse patients (often
   neglected)
   Customizability by medical professionals for versatility
   Backwards-compatibility for older or simpler Android devices
   Through this, the patient will be able to improve his/her volume of
   speech, word pronunciation, and flow of speech conveniently and

   detection based on the spatial and spectral structures of the anomalies.
   This allows outliers to be identified in particular regions and

   estimate the parameters involved in the model yielding a joint linear

Abstract = {{Traditional passive radar systems with a noisy reference signal use the
   cross-correlation statistic for detection. However, owing to the
   composite nature of this hypothesis testing problem, no claims can be
   made about the optimality of this detector. In this paper, we consider
   digital illuminators such that the transmitted signal in a processing
   interval is a weighted periodic summation of several identical pulses.
   The target reflectivity is assumed to change independently from one
   pulse to another within a processing interval. Inspired by random matrix
   theory, we propose a singular value decomposition (SVD) and Eigen
   detector for this model that significantly outperforms the conventional
   cross-correlation detector. We demonstrate this performance improvement
   through extensive numerical simulations across various surveillance and
   reference signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.}},

   function of the external edge connection probability and the noisy edge
   presence probability under a general network model where two arbitrarily
   connected communities are interconnected by random external edges.
   Specifically, the community detection performance transitions from
   almost perfect detectability to low detectability as the inter-community
   edge connection probability exceeds some critical value. We derive upper
   and lower bounds on the critical value and show that the bounds are
   identical when the two communities have the same size. The phase
   transition results are validated using network simulations. Using the
   derived expressions for the phase transition threshold we propose a
   method for estimating this threshold from observed data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a methodology to uncover hidden
   cliques/communities among a set of nodes when observations of their
   relationships or connectivities are noisy. Existing literature in
   community detection typically starts with the assumption that the
   statistical properties of community structure is known a priori, as well
   as the number of communities, so the task at hand is solely to partition
   the set into the given number of groups. In practice neither assumption
   is necessarily true. Motivated by this, we set out to determine a
   detectability condition (from spectral analysis) prior to performing the
   partitioning task, and further illustrate how to combine this
   detectability condition with clustering algorithms to arrive at
   desirable partitions without a priori infonnation on the clique
   structure. We validate our results via simulation and make comparison
   with existing heuristics to demonstrate its advantages.}},

Abstract = {{Social networks often encode community structure using multiple distinct
   types of links between nodes. In this paper we introduce a novel method
   to extract information from such multi-layer networks, where each type
   of link forms its own layer. Using the concept of Pareto optimality,
   community detection in this multi-layer setting is formulated as a
   multiple criterion optimization problem. We propose an algorithm for
   finding an approximate Pareto frontier containing a family of solutions.
   The power of this approach is demonstrated on a Twitter dataset, where
   the nodes are hashtags and the layers correspond to (1) behavioral edges
   connecting pairs of hashtags whose temporal profiles are similar and (2)
   relational edges connecting pairs of hashtags that appear in the same
   tweets.}},

Abstract = {{Orientation estimates derived from gyroscopes are limited in quality by
   the noise and bias characteristics of the sensors. Presently, there is a
   large gap in price and performance between high-end fiber-optic
   gyroscopes and inexpensive MEMS gyroscopes. In this paper, we propose
   using a redundant array of inexpensive gyroscopes (RAIG) in order to
   obtain significant improvements in performance.
   A naive analysis predicts that n gyros should reduce angular rate
   measurement noise by a factor of root n. In this paper, we describe our
   custom array of 72 gyros which we use to evaluate the empirical scaling
   performance. This evaluation includes comparisons between several
   standard filtering and bias estimation algorithms. In addition, we
   propose a principled algorithm that exploits non-linear dynamics,

Abstract = {{Global optimization of the energy consumption of dual power source
   vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicles, and plug in fuel cell electric vehicles requires knowledge of
   the complete route characteristics at the beginning of the trip. One of
   the main characteristics is the vehicle speed profile across the route.
   The profile will translate directly into energy requirements for a given
   vehicle. However, the vehicle speed that a given driver chooses will
   vary from driver to driver and from time to time, and may be slower,
   equal to, or faster than the average traffic flow. If the specific
   driver speed profile can be predicted, the energy usage can be optimized
   across the route chosen. The purpose of this paper is to research the
   application of Deep Learning techniques to this problem to identify at
   the beginning of a drive cycle the driver specific vehicle speed profile
   for an individual driver repeated drive cycle, which can be used in an
   optimization algorithm to minimize the amount of fossil fuel energy used
   during the trip.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a parametric study for (1) downsizing a battery pack
   (reducing the number of battery cells), potentially reducing cost and
   weight; and (2) lowering the nominal operating SOC to reduce
   degradation. The downsized pack design with shifted SOC window is
   evaluated in a lightduty hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) where the power
   demanded by the battery pack is specified prior to downsizing. A
   calibrated electro-thermal model and a semi-empirical capacity fade
   model are used to capture voltage, state-of-charge, temperature and
   capacity loss of the downsized battery. The capacity fade model is
   developed based on a novel set of experiments designed to clarify the
   influence of nominal operating SOC on battery degradation. The
   parametric study shows that the pack size could be reduced from 76 to 64
   cells while shifting nominal operating SOC from 50\% to 35\% without
   experiencing battery power denials. This would result in a 20\% increase
   in energy utilization per cell, with only a 0.4\% increase in capacity
   fade.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile robots for surveillance applications require quiet,
   high-endurance power sources for their long mission run times. This need
   cannot be met by batteries alone due to their low energy density or with
   combustion engines due to noise. A hybrid system combining a high power
   Lithium ion battery with a high energy density fuel cell (FC) system is
   ideal for this application. A propane powered 200W solid oxide fuel cell
   (SOFC) developed by Ultra Electronics is an example of one such system.
   This fuel cell should be operated at full power to obtain maximum system
   efficiency or turned off to conserve fuel. This operating strategy with
   quantized power levels (either on or off) must be paired with a battery
   to provide the energy to re-start the fuel cell and power the vehicle
   during turndown periods. We compare the hybridized SOFC system to one
   with an open cathode Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell paired
   with a battery that allows the PEM FC to load-follow or load-level. The
   application to military tracked robots for two distinct profiles
   (realistic driving and scouting) is considered as an example and
   highlights the need for concurrent power source sizing and power
   splitting.}},

Abstract = {{Data selection is an important component of cross corpus training and
   semi-supervised/active learning. However, its effect on acoustic emotion
   recognition is still not well understood. In this work, we perform an
   in-depth exploration of various data selection strategies for emotion
   classification from speech using classifier agreement as the selection
   metric. Our methods span both the traditional utterance as well as the
   less explored sub utterance level. A median unweighted average recall of
   70.68\%, comparable to the winner of the 2009 INTERSPEECH Emotion
   Challenge, was achieved on the FAU Aibo 2-class problem using less than
   50\% of the training data. Our results indicate that sub-utterance
   selection leads to slightly faster convergence and significantly more
   stable learning. In addition, diversifying instances in terms of
   classifier agreement produces a faster learning rate, whereas selecting
   those near the median results in higher stability. We show that the
   selected data instances can be explained intuitively based on their
   acoustic properties and position within an utterance. Our work helps
   provide a deeper understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and
   trade-offs of different data selection strategies for speech emotion

Abstract = {{Human expressions are often ambiguous and unclear, resulting in
   disagreement or confusion among different human evaluators. In this
   paper, we investigate how audiovisual emotion recognition systems can
   leverage prototypicality, the level of agreement or confusion among
   human evaluators. We propose the use of a weighted Support Vector
   Machine to explicitly model the relationship between the prototypicality
   of training instances and evaluated emotion from the IEMOCAP corpus. We
   choose weights of prototypical and non-prototypical instances based on
   the maximal accuracy of each speaker. We then provide per-speaker
   analysis to understand specific speech characteristics associated with
   the information gain of emotion given prototypicality information. Our
   experimental results show that neutrality, one of the most challenging
   emotion to recognize, has the highest performance gain from
   prototypicality information, compared to other emotion classes: Angry,
   Happy, and Sad. We also show that the proposed method improves the
   overall multi-class classification accuracy significantly over
   traditional methods that do not leverage prototypicality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an extended resonance power divider to increase the
   dynamic range of RF rectifiers. Such a power divider distributes the RF
   input power among several different rectifier cells adaptively based on
   the input power level. Therefore, high rectification efficiency can be
   maintained over a very wide dynamic range. As a proof of concept, a
   two-way dynamic enhancement rectifier network has been designed, which
   exhibits a rectification efficiency greater than 50\% within a dynamic
   range of 35 dB (from -15 dBm to 20 dBm).}},

Abstract = {{A simplified architecture for a scalable phased array is proposed. In
   this design, a new technique for steering the array's beam has been
   devised. The proposed technique integrates the phase shift function into

   phase shifters in phased array. Phase shifters are responsible for a
   great portion of the complexity, size, and cost of phased arrays.
   Therefore, reducing their number allows for less complexity and cost. As
   a proof of concept, a Ku-band eight element phased array based on the
   proposed method is presented. This array has 33 degrees of scan range
   and is composed of variable gain amplifiers, power combiners/dividers,
   and two phase shifters.}},

Abstract = {{Demand response can provide power system services such as regulation and
   load following, helping support higher penetrations of renewables,
   reduce power system emissions, and reduce the cost of power system
   operation. In non-disruptive demand response (NDDR) programs, an
   aggregator controls electric loads to help balance electricity supply
   and demand while allowing the loads to perform their end-function.
   Previous research has shown that aggregators can provide higher quality
   services with more information about consumer loads. In this paper, we
   estimate the environmental and economic benefits of NDDR as a function
   of the amount of information shared by consumers. Specifically, we use
   simulation data to develop models that capture the ability of NDDR to
   provide services under a variety of information-availability scenarios.
   We then determine the amount of traditional power system services
   required to compensate imperfect NDDR, and use values from the
   literature to determine the cost and environmental impact of these
   services. We find that the decrease in benefits from full information
   sharing to full privacy is large (the latter achieves only 12\% of the
   former). Our results could be used to develop surveys to assess consumer
   preferences for NDDR participation and information sharing.}},

Abstract = {{Utilities and researchers are looking for ways to coordinate the
   operation of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) to help integrate
   higher penetrations of renewable energy generation. However, using TCLs
   for demand response can result in an increase in TCL switching
   frequencies, which could affect distribution transformer (DT)
   temperatures. This paper explores the relation between DT overheating
   and TCL switching. We simulated a fleet of TCLs and found that higher
   switching frequencies result in lower maximum DT temperatures. We
   develop a DT-TCL model that estimates maximum DT temperatures as a
   function of the frequency of the power consumption of a small
   aggregation of TCLs, and we validate it through simulation.
   Additionally, we perform a case study to show that how TCL control
   impacts maximum DT temperatures. In general, control increases switching
   frequencies, reducing maximum DT temperatures; however, in some cases,
   it increases power amplitudes which can increase maximum DT
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{In the process of development and application of service-oriented

   manufacturing resource allocation is always one of the most important
   issues need to be addressed. With the permeation of Internet of things

   service and task management in SOM is facing some new challenges under

   environment (i.e., complexity, sociality, dynamics, uncertainty,
   distribution, expandability, etc.), a manufacturing service and task
   management method based on complex networks is proposed in this paper.
   The models of manufacturing service network (S\_Net) and manufacturing
   task network (T\_Net) are built according to the digital description of
   manufacturing service and task. Then the manufacturing service
   management upon S\_Net and manufacturing task management upon T\_Net are

Abstract = {{The paper presents the design and analysis of a ground-based beacon
   signal that will be used for testing and calibration of spaceborne
   GNSS-reflectometry (GNSS-R) instruments aboard the upcoming Cyclone GNSS
   (CYGNSS) Mission. GNSS-R provides remote sensing capabilities of
   geophysical properties by tracking the reflections of GNSS signals off
   of the surface of the Earth using downward-looking antennas. The
   fundamental measurement made by GNSS-R receivers is the delay-Doppler
   map (DDM). For CYGNSS, the beacon signal will be composed of precisely
   timed and controlled replicas of the GPS C/A-code signal which create a
   pattern in the DDM measurement. Design and generation of this signal
   require careful consideration of the receiver instrument, satellite
   geometry and transmit power restrictions in order to ensure test
   objectives will be met.}},

Abstract = {{Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer PV cells have shown strong potential
   for low cost, easy processable and flexible solar cells with acceptable
   efficiencies. Manufacturability is viewed as a key advantage of this new
   technology, but not yet fully realized. This chapter will first
   introduce a novel processing technology, which allows evaporation of
   solvent through surface encapsulation and with induced alignment
   (ESSENCIAL) of polymer chains by applied pressure, which leads to
   optimized morphology, more uniform distribution and crystallinity of the
   components favorable for charge generation and transportation. The
   second part of this chapter will discuss the optimization of BHJ blends
   with hundreds of nanometers thick photoactive layers, which are thick
   enough to fully absorb the light and also roll-to-roll fabrication
   friendly. In the third part of this chapter, a new type of
   heterojunction structure that has almost 100 \% internal quantum
   efficiency (IQE) even in over 300 nm thick photoactive layer,
   consequently providing superior photocurrent and fill factor compared
   with optimized BHJ PV cells, will be introduced. In the last section of
   this chapter, we will discuss our recent work on nanoimprint lithography
   (NIL)-based transparent metal electrode (TME) technology as a promising
   alternative for the ITO electrode that can pave the way toward large
   area flexible organic PV (OPV) cells.}},

   Then a procedure is outlined on how to convert the results of the

Abstract = {{Closed-form solutions for cohesive zone modeling within the framework of
   classical lamination theory (CLT), for the popular mode I double
   cantilever beam (DCB) test and the mode II end notched flexure (ENF)
   test are provided in this paper. Zero-thickness virtual multi-linear
   traction-separation laws are introduced to simulate the cohesive
   interactions between potential crack surfaces. The problem is formulated
   by solution forms corresponding to each segment of the cohesive laws and
   using appropriate boundary and continuity conditions. Detailed
   algorithms for each case is provided to clearly show the influence of
   the cohesive zone law on the ensuing crack growth. Comprehensive
   parametric studies are performed on the crack growth response and the
   process zone length, revealing their relations to the delamination
   length, cohesive parameters and the shape of the traction-separation
   laws. With applicability to general multilayered structures, and the
   capability to incorporate arbitrary, piecewise linear cohesive
   constitutive laws, the closed-form solutions can serve as a tool to
   determine the accuracy of numerical solutions used in conjunction with
   the finite element simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic flexural response of a hybrid 3D textile composites (H3DTC)
   was examined through a three-point bend test. The H3DTC contains three
   different types of constituent fibers, including carbon, glass, and
   Kevlar that are integrally woven into a single preform. Tests were
   carried out using a drop tower facility, which can provide different
   impact velocities by varying the height of the weight that is dropped
   onto the specimen. High-speed cameras were utilized to record the
   deformation history and identify the modes of failure. The experimental
   results show that the development of kink bands in the tows undergoing
   compressive straining, limits the strength of the H3DTC in flexure,
   while the final catastrophic failure is due to tow rupture occurring in
   regions subjected to tensile straining. A global-local multiscale finite
   element (FE) model was developed to predict the progressive damage and
   failure response of the H3DTC subjected to low velocity impact. The
   composite was homogenized as an orthotropic solid at the macroscale,
   while the damage and failure was incorporated through a mesoscale FE
   model, which is a collection of repeat unit cells (RUCs) that are
   composed of fiber tows embedded in a surrounding matrix. A novel
   micromechanics model was implemented at the fiber-matrix level to
   compute the fiber tow constitutive responses at the mesoscale. The
   smeared crack approach (SCA) was employed to model the observed failure
   modes, including matrix cracking, tow kinking, and tow rupture. The
   computational results agree well with the experiment. Therefore, the
   proposed multiscale model can be used as a validated computational tool
   to understand the effect of textile architecture and constituent
   properties on the progressive damage and failure responses of 3D textile
   composites.}},
