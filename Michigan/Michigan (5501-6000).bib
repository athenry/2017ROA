Abstract = {{Memristors have been proposed for a number of applications from
   nonvolatile memory to neuromorphic systems. Unlike conventional devices
   based solely on electron transport, memristors operate on the principle
   of resistive switching (RS) based on redistribution of ions. To date, a
   number of experimental and modeling studies have been reported to probe
   the RS mechanism; however, a complete physical picture that can
   quantitatively describe the dynamic RS behavior is still missing. Here,
   we present a quantitative and accurate dynamic switching model that not
   only fully accounts for the rich RS behaviors in memristors in a unified
   framework but also provides critical insight for continued device
   design, optimization, and applications. The proposed model reveals the
   roles of electric field, temperature, oxygen vacancy concentration
   gradient, and different material and device parameters on RS and allows
   accurate predictions of diverse set/reset, analog switching, and
   complementary RS behaviors using only material-dependent device
   parameters.}},

   Observation of Enhanced Auger Recombination Due to Defect Saturation}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Photoexcited carrier relaxation is a recurring topic in understanding
   the transient conductivity dynamics of graphene-based devices. For
   atomically thin graphene oxide (GO), a simple free-carrier Drude
   response is expected to govern the terahertz (THz) conductivity dynamics
   same dynamics observed in conventional CVD-grown graphene. However, to
   date, no experimental testimony has been provided on the origin of
   photoinduced conductivity increase in GO. Here, using ultrafast THz
   spectroscopy, we show that the photoexcited carrier relaxation in GO
   exhibits a peculiar non-Drude behavior. Unlike graphene, the THz
   dynamics of GO show percolation behaviors: as the annealing temperature
   increases, transient THz conductivity rapidly increases and the
   associated carrier relaxation changes from mono- to biexponential decay.
   After saturating the recombination decay through defect trapping, a new
   ultrafast decay channel characterized by multiparticle Auger scattering
   is observed whose threshold pump fluence is found to be 50 mu J/cm(2).
   The increased conductivity is rapidly suppressed within 1 ps due to the
   Auger recombination, and non-Drude THz absorptions are subsequently
   emerged as a result of the defect-trapped high-frequency oscillators.}},

Title = {{Integrated Nanoplasmonic Sensing for Cellular Functional Immunoanalysis
   Using Human Blood}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) nanoplasmonic effects allow
   for label-free, real-time detection of biomolecule binding events on a
   nanostructured metallic surface with simple optics and sensing
   tunability. Despite numerous reports on LSPR bionanosensing in the past,
   no study thus far has applied the technique for a cytokine secretion
   assay using clinically relevant immune cells from human blood. Cytokine
   secretion assays, a technique to quantify intercellular-signaling
   proteins secreted by blood immune cells, allow determination of the
   functional response of the donor's immune cells, thus providing valuable
   information about the immune status of the donor. However,
   implementation of LSPR bionanosensing in cellular functional
   immunoanalysis based on a cytokine secretion assay poses major
   challenges primarily owing to its limited sensitivity and a lack of
   sufficient sample handling capability. In this paper, we have developed
   a label-free LSPR biosensing technique to detect cell-secreted tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha cytokines in clinical blood samples. Our
   approach integrates LSPR bionanosensors in an optofluidic platform that
   permits trapping and stimulation of target immune cells in a
   microfluidic chamber with optical access for subsequent cytokine
   detection. The on-chip spatial confinement of the cells is the key to
   rapidly increasing a cytokine concentration high enough for detection by
   the LSPR setup, thereby allowing the assay time and sample volume to be
   significantly reduced. We have successfully applied this approach first
   to THP-1 cells and then later to CD45 cells isolated directly from human
   blood. Our LSPR optofluidics device allows for detection of TNF-alpha
   secreted from cells as few as 1000, which translates into a nearly 100
   times decrease in sample volume than conventional cytokine secretion
   assay techniques require. We achieved cellular functional immunoanalysis
   with a minimal blood sample volume (3 mu L) and a total assay time 3
   times shorter than that of the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA).}},

Abstract = {{Considerable progress in the synthesis of anisotropic patchy nanoplates
   (nanoplatelets) promises a rich variety of highly ordered
   two-dimensional superlattices. Recent experiments of superlattices
   assembled from nanoplates confirm the accessibility of exotic phases and
   motivate the need for a better understanding of the underlying
   self-assembly mechanisms. Here, we present experimentally accessible,
   rational design rules for the self-assembly of the Archimedean tilings
   from polygonal nanoplates. The Archimedean tilings represent a model set
   of target patterns that (i) contain both simple and complex patterns,
   (ii) are comprised of simple regular shapes, and (iii) contain patterns
   with potentially interesting materials properties. Via Monte Carlo
   simulations, we propose a set of design rules with general applicability
   to one- and two-component systems of polygons. These design rules,
   specified by increasing levels of patchiness, correspond to a reduced
   set of anisotropy dimensions for robust self-assembly of the Archimedean
   tilings. We show for which tilings entropic patches alone are sufficient
   for assembly and when short-range enthalpic interactions are required.
   For the latter, we show how patchy these interactions should be for
   optimal yield. This study provides a minimal set of guidelines for the
   design of anisostropic patchy particles that can self-assemble all 11
   Archimedean tilings.}},

Abstract = {{The objective to send more massive landed missions to the surface of
   Mars necessitates further research and development for ways to
   adequately decelerate the lander, such as propulsive deceleration.
   Experimental measurements using planar laser-induced iodine fluorescence
   provide qualitative visualizations and quantitative propulsive
   decelerator jet mole fraction measurements over a 0.22\% scaled Mars
   Science Laboratory aeroshell. Peripheral (off-centerline) sonic and
   supersonic propulsive decelerator jet models, with jet exit velocities
   of Mach 1.0 and 2.66, were studied in Mach 12 flow and compared with
   numerical results obtained using computational fluid dynamics.
   Experimental visualizations were obtained for various thrust
   coefficients ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 in increments of 0.5. Experimental
   results indicate that, for both sonic and supersonic jets, the bow shock
   is preserved between the peripheral jets and, as thrust coefficient
   increases, the bow shock is pushed farther from the aeroshell forebody,
   with the supersonic jets having a greater shock standoff distance than
   sonic models at thrust coefficient greater than 2.0. Comparisons of the
   experimental visualizations to computed streamlines and shock locations
   show good agreement. Computed propulsive decelerator jet mole fractions
   for both sonic and supersonic thrust coefficient of 1.5 closely match
   experimental results through the jet cores and in cross-sectional cuts.}},

Abstract = {{The new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)
   duty-hour standards for residents and fellows went into effect in 2011.
   These regulations were designed to reduce fatigue-related medical errors
   and improve patient safety. The new shift restrictions, however, have
   led to more frequent transitions in patient care (handoffs), resulting
   in greater opportunity for communication breakdowns between caregivers,
   which correlate with medical errors and adverse events. Recent research
   has focused on improving the quality of these transitions through
   standardization of the handoff protocols; however, no attention has been
   given to reducing the number of transitions in patient care. This
   research leverages integer programming methods to design a work shift
   schedule for trainees that minimizes patient handoffs while complying
   with all ACGME duty-hour standards, providing required coverage, and
   maintaining physician quality of life. In a case study of redesigning
   the trainees' schedule for a Mayo Clinic Medical Intensive Care Unit
   (MICU), we show that the number of patient handoffs can be reduced by 23
   \% and still meet all required and most desired scheduling constraints.
   Furthermore, a 48 \% reduction in handoffs could be achieved if only the
   minimum required rules are satisfied.}},

Abstract = {{a In this communication, expressions for the group velocity and the
   direction of power flow along an idealized tensor impedance boundary
   condition (TIBC) and a printed-circuit tensor impedance surface (PCTIS),
   are found. A PCTIS consists of a patterned metallic cladding over a
   grounded dielectric substrate. The patterned metallic cladding is
   modeled by a tensor impedance sheet. Expressions for the surface
   impedance of a TIBC and a PCTIS are reviewed. From these expressions,
   the group velocity and direction of power flow are derived as a function
   of transverse wave vector. A PCTIS exhibits spatial dispersion due to
   the electrical thickness of its substrate while a TIBC does not. As a
   result of this spatial dispersion, a PCTIS can have the same surface
   impedance as a TIBC for a given transverse wave vector, but a different
   direction of power flow. The expressions for direction of power flow
   along a TIBC and a PCTIS are verified with a full-wave electromagnetic
   solver.}},

Abstract = {{A two-terminal memristor device is a promising digital memory for its
   high integration density, substantially lower energy consumption
   compared to CMOS, and scalability below 10 nm. However, a nanoscale
   memristor is an inherently stochastic device, and extra energy and
   latency are required to make a deterministic memory based on memristors.
   Instead of enforcing deterministic storage, we take advantage of the
   nondeterministic memory for native stochastic computing, where the
   randomness required by stochastic computing is intrinsic to the devices
   without resorting to expensive stochastic number generation. This native
   stochastic computing system can be implemented as a hybrid integration
   of memristor memory and simple CMOS stochastic computing circuits. We
   use an approach called group write to program memristor memory cells in
   arrays to generate random bit streams for stochastic computing. Three
   methods are proposed to program memristors using stochastic bit streams
   and compensate for the nonlinear memristor write function: voltage
   predistortion, parallel single-pulse write, and downscaled write and
   upscaled read. To evaluate these technical approaches, we show by
   simulation a memristor-based stochastic processor for gradient descent
   optimization, and k-means clustering. The native stochastic computing
   based on memristors demonstrates key advantages in energy and speed in
   compute-intensive, data-intensive, and probabilistic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been a lot of focus on penalized least squares
   problems for noisy sparse signal estimation. The penalty induces
   sparsity and a very common choice has been the convex l(1) norm.
   However, to improve sparsity and reduce the biases associated with the
   l(1) norm, one must move to non-convex penalties such as the l(1) norm
   (0 < q < 1). In this paper we present a novel cyclic descent algorithm
   for optimizing the resulting l(q) penalized least squares problem.
   Optimality conditions for this problem are derived and competing ones
   clarified. Coordinate-wise convergence as well as convergence to a local
   minimizer of the algorithm, which is highly non-trivial, is proved and
   we illustrate with simulations comparing the signal reconstruction
   quality with three penalty functions: l(0), l(1) and l(q) with 0 < q <
   1.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the classical JKR theory of the adhesive contact of
   isotropic elastic spheres is extended to consider the effect of
   anisotropic elasticity. The contact area will then generally be
   non-circular, but in many cases it can reasonably be approximated by an
   ellipse whose dimensions are determined by imposing the energy release
   rate criterion at the ends of the major and minor axes. Analytical
   expressions are obtained for the relations between the contact force,
   the normal displacement and the ellipse semi-axes. It is found that the
   eccentricity of the contact area decreases during tensile loading and
   for cases when the point load solution can be accurately described by
   only one Fourier term, it is almost circular at pull-off, permitting an
   exact closed form solution for this case. As in the isotropic JKR
   solution, the pull-off force is independent of the mean elastic modulus,
   but we find that anisotropy increases the pull-off force and this effect
   can be quite significant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we demonstrate the use of the Green-Kubo integral of the

   to model the thermal conductivity versus temperature relationship of
   cross-linked polymers. The simulations were performed on a cross-linked
   epoxy made from DGEBA and a curing agent (diamino diphenyl sulfone)
   using a consistent valence force field (CVFF). A dendrimeric approach
   was utilized for building equilibrated cross-linked structures that
   allowed replication of the experimental dilatometric curve for the epoxy
   system. We demonstrate that the inclusion of a long-range correction
   within the Ewald/PPPM approach brings the results close to
   experimentally measured conductivity within an error of 10\% while
   providing a good prediction of the relationship of thermal conductivity
   versus temperature. This method shows significant promise towards the
   computation of thermal conductivity from simulations even before
   synthesis of the polymer for purposes of materials by design.}},

Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display multipotent characteristics that
   make them ideal for potential therapeutic applications. MSCs are
   typically cultured as monolayers on tissue culture plastic, but there is
   increasing evidence suggesting that they may lose their multipotency
   over time in vitro and eventually cease to retain any resemblance to in
   vivo resident MSCs. Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems that more
   closely recapitulate the physiological environment of MSCs and other
   cell types are increasingly explored for their capacity to support and
   maintain the cell phenotypes. In much of our own work, we have utilized
   fibrin, a natural protein-based material that serves as the provisional
   extracellular matrix during wound healing. Fibrin has proven to be
   useful in numerous tissue engineering applications and has been used
   clinically as a hemostatic material. Its rapid self-assembly driven by
   thrombin-mediated alteration of fibrinogen makes fibrin an attractive 3D
   substrate, in which cells can adhere, spread, proliferate, and undergo
   complex morphogenetic programs. However, there is a significant need for
   simple cost-effective methods to safely retrieve cells encapsulated
   within fibrin hydrogels to perform additional analyses or use the cells
   for therapy. Here, we present a safe and efficient protocol for the
   isolation of MSCs from 3D fibrin gels. The key ingredient of our
   successful extraction method is nattokinase, a serine protease of the
   subtilisin family that has a strong fibrinolytic activity. Our data show
   that MSCs recovered from 3D fibrin gels using nattokinase are not only
   viable but also retain their proliferative and multilineage potentials.
   Demonstrated for MSCs, this method can be readily adapted to retrieve
   any other cell type from 3D fibrin gel constructs for various
   applications, including expansion, bioassays, and in vivo implantation.}},

Abstract = {{Altered cognitive function has been associated with breast cancer
   treatment, particularly adjuvant chemotherapy, but the underlying
   neuropsychological mechanisms are not yet understood. Recent research
   indicates that compromised attention and working memory can exist before
   adjuvant treatment, implicating psychological distress, such as worry,
   as a possible contributor to observed alterations in cognitive function.
   We hypothesized that worry associated with breast cancer diagnosis might
   influence neurocognitive responses before any adjuvant therapy. Design:
   Fifty women, 25 due to receive chemotherapy and 25 due to receive
   radiation therapy, participated in the study. Women performed a verbal
   working memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   scanning to assess neurocognitive responses before any adjuvant
   treatment and to test the relationship of such responses with
   self-reports of worry. Results: Although prechemotherapy participants
   showed significantly higher levels of worry compared with preradiation
   participants, higher worry, across both groups, was related to altered
   brain function. Specifically, increased worry was associated with
   reduced demand-related deactivation in default-mode regions, such as the
   precuneus/posterior cingulate. Reduced demand-related deactivation was
   critically related to worse behavioral performance, which was partially
   mediated by worry. Conclusion: Worry appears to be a significant
   contributor to neurocognitive dysfunction independent of adjuvant
   treatment for breast cancer. These results suggest that alterations in
   cognitive function may develop before any chemotherapy treatment and
   that worry about cancer diagnosis may contribute to reports of ``chemo
   brain{''} during treatment. Psychological interventions aimed at
   mitigating worry may help to alleviate cognitive dysfunction associated
   with life-threatening illness such as breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of the power consumption of a high-throughput LDPC decoder
   is spent on memory. Unlike in a general-purpose processor, the memory
   access in an LDPC decoder is deterministic and the access window is
   short. We take advantage of the unique memory access characteristic to
   design a non-refresh eDRAM that holds data for the necessary access
   window, and further improve its access time by trading off the excess
   retention time. The resulting 3T eDRAM cell is designed to balance
   wordline coupling to reliably retain data for a fast access. We
   integrate 32 5x210 non-refresh eDRAM arrays in a row-parallel LDPC
   decoder suitable for the IEEE 802.11ad standard. Memory refresh is
   eliminated and random access is replaced with a simple sequential
   addressing. With row merging and dual-frame processing, the 1.6 mm(2) 65
   nm LDPC decoder chip achieves a peak throughput of 9 Gb/s at 89.5 pJ/b,
   of which only 21\% is spent on eDRAMs. With voltage and frequency
   scaling, the power consumption of the LDPC decoder is reduced to 37.7 mW
   for a 1.5 Gb/s throughput at 35.6 pJ/b.}},

Abstract = {{Recent applications of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to
   the optimal power flow (OPF) problem offers a polynomial time method to
   compute a global optimum for a large subclass of OPF problems. In
   contrast, prior OPF solution methods in the literature guarantee only
   local optimality for the solution produced. However, solvers employing
   SDP relaxation remain significantly slower than mature OPF solution
   codes. This letter seeks to combine the advantages of the two methods.
   In particular, we develop an SDP-inspired sufficient condition test for
   global optimality of a candidate OPF solution. This test may then be
   easily applied to a candidate solution generated by a traditional,
   only-guaranteed-locally-optimal OPF solver.}},

Abstract = {{From first principles, we arrive at a generalized Tsu-Esaki formula for
   current per unit-cell in the case of one-dimensional, time-independent,
   open-system charge-transport along the growth direction of stacked
   layers of self-assembled quantum dots with perfect, transverse
   Bravais-lattice layout. We rigorously derive, using symmetry
   considerations, great simplifications to the final formula and identify
   significant computational benefits that would make modeling and
   simulation for such a complex problem not only feasible but also
   efficient. We allow an arbitrary sequence of quantum dot layers with or
   without intervening spacer and wetting layers. While the symmetry does
   suggest that final expressions for transmission coefficients should have
   simple form, the split, open boundary conditions as well as lack of
   longitudinal symmetry cast doubt on this. Employing a multiple
   sequential scattering view of processes within the heterostructure
   layers and using a limiting argument, we prove that the device behaves
   as a diffraction grating which distributes incident-carrier
   wavefunction-phases into specific patterns of reflected and transmitted
   phases which forms the basis for our conclusions.}},

   turbine deviate from the power curve limits, particularly considering
   their degree of deviation from the power curve limits and the cases when

Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{181-195}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion battery cells of pouch type for battery electric vehicles
   are often joined by ultrasonic welding. High-frequency vibration
   generated by the piezoelectric transducer of the welder creates
   solid-state bonds between the workpieces via interfacial frictional
   heat. This vibration, however, can cause parasitic vibration of the
   entire system that is harmful to the structure (such as destroying
   existing welds). In this study, a modulation of input waveforms of the
   ultrasonic welder is proposed to reduce such parasitic vibration. A
   series of vibration models are analyzed: (a) a discrete model of
   single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) mass-spring-damper system to understand
   rigid body dynamics, (b) a continuous model of multi-degree-of-freedom
   (MDOF) cantilever beam to study an elastic body system, and (c) a
   battery welding system to study a complex real-world application.
   Analyses indicate that the waveform modulation (including 180A
   degrees-phase shift, pause, amplitude stepping, and frequency
   modulation) can reduce parasitic vibration while improving or
   maintaining the quality of the weld that is being ultrasonically made.}},

Title = {{Finite element model of the cyclic bending behavior of hollow structural
   sections}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{64-75}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Hollow structural sections (HSS) are desirable for utilization in
   structural applications due to their inherent flexural, compression, and
   torsional properties. These sections are highly efficient, but have been
   underutilized in cyclic bending applications due to a lack of
   understanding of their behavior under these loads. To address the
   limited experimental data and determine potential limiting parameters
   for the use of HSS in seismic bending applications, a finite element
   model (FEM) considering experimentally measured material properties,
   section geometry, and geometric imperfections has been calibrated and
   validated to experimental findings. A parametric study is conducted on
   133 different standard HSS beam members of sizes ranging from HSS 152 x
   50.8 x 4.8 to HSS 508 x 305 x 15.9. To provide insight into the
   parameters that limit stable hysteretic behavior, the decrease in the
   overall maximum moment capacity with cycling at a given rotation level,
   rotational capacity at a given degradation of the moment capacity, and
   decrease of the secant stiffness with cycling are considered. The
   findings provide information about the interdependence of the
   width-thickness and depth-thickness ratios on the cyclic bending
   behavior of HSS. Linear regression analyses provide a relationship
   between the width-thickness and depth-thickness ratios and member
   performance from which equations for predicting the degradation of
   moment capacity and rotational capacity can be defined. (C) 2013

   Force Polarity and Durotaxis}},
Journal = {{CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{26-34}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Rigidity sensing plays a fundamental role in multiple cell functions
   ranging from migration, to proliferation and differentiation (Engler et
   al., Cell 126:677-689, 2006; Lo et al., Biophys. J. 79:144-152, 2000;
   Wells, Hepatology 47:1394-1400, 2008; Zoldan et al., Biomaterials
   32:9612-9621, 2011). During migration, single cells have been reported
   to preferentially move toward more rigid regions of a substrate in a
   process termed durotaxis. Durotaxis could contribute to cell migration
   in wound healing and gastrulation, where local gradients in tissue
   rigidity have been described. Despite the potential importance of this
   phenomenon to physiology and disease, it remains unclear how rigidity
   guides these behaviors and the underlying cellular and molecular
   mechanisms. To investigate the functional role of subcellular
   distribution and dynamics of cellular traction forces during durotaxis,
   we developed a unique microfabrication strategy to generate elastomeric
   micropost arrays patterned with regions exhibiting two different
   rigidities juxtaposed next to each other. After initial cell attachment
   on the rigidity boundary of the micropost array, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts
   were observed to preferentially migrate toward the rigid region of the
   micropost array, indicative of durotaxis. Additionally, cells bridging
   two rigidities across the rigidity boundary on the micropost array
   developed stronger traction forces on the more rigid side of the
   substrate indistinguishable from forces generated by cells exclusively
   seeded on rigid regions of the micropost array. Together, our results
   highlighted the utility of step-rigidity micropost arrays to investigate
   the functional role of traction forces in rigidity sensing and
   durotaxis, suggesting that cells could sense substrate rigidity locally
   to induce an asymmetrical intracellular traction force distribution to
   contribute to durotaxis.}},

   the study of 3D bipedal locomotion, with the aim of combining energy
   efficiency, speed, and robustness with respect to natural terrain
   variations in a single platform. The robot is highly underactuated,
   having 6 actuators and, in single support, 13 degrees of freedom. Its
   sagittal plane dynamics are designed to embody the spring loaded
   inverted pendulum (SLIP), which has been shown to provide a dynamic
   model of the body center of mass during steady running gaits of a wide
   diversity of terrestrial animals. A detailed dynamic model is used to
   optimize walking gaits with respect to the cost of mechanical transport
   (CMT), a dimensionless measure of energetic efficiency, for walking
   speeds ranging from 0.5 (m/s) to 1.4 (m/s). A feedback controller is
   designed that stabilizes the 3D walking gaits, despite the high degree
   of underactuation of the robot. The 3D results are illustrated in
   simulation. In experiments on a planarized (2D) version of the robot,
   the controller yielded stable walking.}},

Title = {{Extensible-Link Kinematic Model for Characterizing and Optimizing
   Compliant Mechanism Motion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We present an analytical model for characterizing the motion trajectory
   of an arbitrary planar compliant mechanism. Model development consists
   of identifying particular material points and their connecting vectorial
   lengths in a manner that represents the mechanism topology; whereby
   these lengths may extend over the course of actuation to account for the
   elastic deformation of the compliant mechanism. The motion trajectory is
   represented within the model as an analytical function in terms of these
   vectorial lengths, whereby its Taylor series expansion constitutes a
   parametric formulation composed of load-independent and load-dependent
   terms. This adds insight to the process for designing compliant
   mechanisms for high-accuracy motion applications because: (1) inspection
   of the load-independent terms enables determination of specific topology
   modifications that reduce or eliminate certain error components of the
   motion trajectory; and (2) the load-dependent terms reveal the
   polynomial orders of principally uncorrectable error components in the
   trajectory. The error components in the trajectory simply represent the
   deviation of the actual motion trajectory provided by the compliant
   mechanism compared to the ideally desired one. A generalized model
   framework is developed, and its utility demonstrated via the design of a
   compliant microgripper with straight-line parallel jaw motion. The model
   enables analytical determination of all geometric modifications for
   minimizing the error trajectory of the jaw, and prediction of the
   polynomial order of the uncorrectable trajectory components. The jaw
   trajectory is then optimized using iterative finite elements simulations
   until the polynomial order of the uncorrectable trajectory component
   becomes apparent; this reduces the error in the jaw trajectory by 2
   orders of magnitude over the prescribed jaw stroke. This model serves to
   streamline the design process by identifying the load-dependent sources
   of trajectory error in a compliant mechanism, and thereby the limits
   with which this error may be redressed by topology modification.}},

Abstract = {{Area coverage is a common task for an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that
   requires time and energy to complete. We have developed a novel cost
   function that can be used to optimally traverse a path that covers a
   region. The UGV model and cost function are developed theoretically and
   verified experimentally. Our cost function weights force inputs, area
   covered and motor efficiency to create an optimal trajectory. This
   trajectory is constrained to follow a coverage path described in the
   literature. The path is modified based on the cost function by replacing
   turn-in-place maneuvers by moving turns. Tradeoffs are presented for
   three cases: (1) drive motor efficiency is not considered, (2) the
   motors are most efficient at the maximum velocity, and (3) the motors
   are most efficient below the maximum velocity. Optimality tradeoffs
   include the time required to cover the region, and the energy required
   to complete the trajectory. Experimental results using an iRobot Packbot
   are presented.}},

Volume = {{191}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Histotripsy is a focused ultrasound technology that uses
   controlled acoustic cavitation to homogenize targeted tissue. We
   assessed local and systemic effects after histotripsy treatment with the
   Vortx R-X (R) system in a canine model. The system was not approved for
   human use at the time of the study.
   Materials and Methods: Histotripsy was applied in 10 intact male dogs.
   The therapy transducer (36 elements, 700 kHz and 11 cm focal distance)
   delivered acoustic bursts (3 cycles and 500 Hz pulse repetition
   frequency) trans-abdominally to the prostate for 60 minutes. Tissue and
   systemic response were assessed by transrectal ultrasound, cystoscopy
   and interval evaluation of blood and urine parameters. Prostates were
   harvested on postoperative day 2 in 2 dogs and on postoperative day 28
   in 8.
   Results: A treatment cavity was apparent in each prostate on transrectal
   ultrasound and cystoscopy. Mean prostate volume decreased 36\% (range
   19\% to 53\%) by postoperative day 28. Although clinical symptoms were
   not produced, notable pathological findings at necropsy consisted of
   rectal wall muscle degeneration in 2 animals and concern for a potential
   histotripsy effect and 1 cm diameter areas of fibrosis in the abdominal
   rectus muscle in 2 animals suggestive of thermal injury along the
   acoustic propagation path to the prostate.
   Conclusions: Extracorporeal application of histotripsy produced prostate
   debulking in all dogs. Pathological findings of collateral injury are of
   concern since this may represent suboptimal confinement of cavitation or
   heating of overlying tissue. Further study is under way to quantify the
   prefocal thermal fields to eliminate these effects before human
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Desulfurization of natural gas is achieved commercially by absorption
   with liquid amine solutions. Adsorption technology could potentially
   replace the solvent extraction process, particularly for the emerging
   shale gas wells with production rates that are generally lower than that
   from the large conventional reservoirs, if a superior adsorbent
   (sorbent) is developed. In this review, we focus our discussion on three
   types of sorbents: metaloxide based sorbents, Cu/Ag-based and other
   commercial sorbents, and amine-grafted silicas. The advantages and
   disadvantages of each type are analyzed. Possible approaches for future
   developments to further improve these sorbents are suggested,
   particularly for the most promising amine-grafted silicas.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we formulate several stochastic optimization models for
   trading off between energy footprints and quality of service associated
   with server consolidation in cloud computing data centers. We consider
   finite service times with uncertain workloads at each period and
   minimize the expected energy consumption. Decisions include workload
   scheduling and switching servers on or off based on estimated loads. In
   models involving backlogging and penalizing unmet demand, we first
   incorporate zero-delay and zero-work-loss criteria, of which the latter
   allows backlogging but sets deadlines and penalty cost for all delays.
   We also formulate alternative chance-constrained programs to ensure that
   workload delay percentage is within a certain risk tolerance. By
   assuming scenario-based workload realizations, we solve each model as an
   mixed-integer program. For the zero-work-loss model, when all servers
   are homogeneous (i.e., have the same computational efficiency), we
   provide a heuristic approach. We also consider a benchmark two-stage
   stochastic program, which involves recourse scheduling decisions and is
   solved using the Benders decomposition. Numerical results demonstrate
   the computational efficacy and reduction of energy consumption for
   certain patterns of workload realizations. In particular, we consider
   instances generated from a typical daily workload pattern existing in
   many data centers and provide managerial insights.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes preliminary results of replacing water-based
   (aqueous) flood coolant with supercritical CO2-based minimum quantity
   lubrication (scCO2 MQL) in an external turning operation on an Inconel
   750 combustor housing. Two series of tests were performed: the first
   series to compare tool wear performance observed with aqueous flood
   coolant and scCO2 MQL under identical machining conditions, and the
   second series to investigate tool wear performance with scCO2 MQL at
   higher metal removal rates (MRR) than the MRR used in production
   practice with aqueous flood coolant. All tests were performed using
   roughing cuts on unaged Inconel with coated carbide tooling, and
   vegetable oil lubricant. As a key enabler, special flank jet tool
   holders were used to eliminate chip blockage of the lubricant stream.
   In the first series of tests, tool wear was observed to be consistently
   lower with scCO2 MQL than with the aqueous flood coolant. In the second
   series of tests, two process conditions were demonstrated for which MRR
   increased by 25\% and 40\%, respectively, with scCO2 MQL compared to
   aqueous flood coolant at equivalent tool life. Notch wear, the limiting
   factor for tool life under baseline conditions, was reduced for scCO2
   MQL, but crater wear and chip hammering were more pronounced. Overall
   the results indicate that scCO2 MQL can provide increased tool life or
   material removal rate compared to aqueous flood coolants when machining
   Inconel 750 and similar nickel alloys by improving lubricity and
   changing the dominant wear mechanism from rapid notch wear to gradual
   crater wear and chip hammering. These tests, which involved extended
   cuts of over 10 min under production conditions, represent an important
   extension of MQL machining to a hard metal alloy that cannot be machined
   by conventional MQL methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{141-149}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We herein report on the catalytic processing of pretreated algal oil
   that was produced from the hydrothermal liquefaction of Chlorella
   pyrenoidosa. The activities of 5\% Pt/C, 5\% Pd/C, 5\% Ru/C, 5\% Pt/C
   (sulfided), Mo2C, MoS2, alumina, CoMo/gamma-Al2O3 (sulfided),
   Ni/SiO2-Al2O3, HZSM-5, activated carbon, and Raney-Ni for hydrothermal
   hydrodeoxygenation and hydrodenitrogenation of the pretreated algal oil
   at 400 degrees C were determined. Ru/C showed the best performance for
   deoxygenation and Raney-Ni was the most suitable catalyst for
   denitrogenation. The upgraded oil from the Ru/C catalyzed reaction
   contained the highest hydrocarbon content, the highest fraction of
   material boiling below 400 degrees C, and the highest higher heating
   value (45.1 MJ/kg). All of the metal catalysts produced freely flowing
   upgraded oil. The combination of Ru/C and Raney Ni, which showed very
   good deoxygenation and denitrogenation of the oil, produced upgraded oil
   that retained 86\% of the heating value in the original pretreated oil.
   This upgraded oil was also produced in a higher yield (77.2 wt.\%) and
   with lower gas (9.4 wt.\%), coke (15.6 wt.\%) and water-soluble products
   yields (2.1 wt.\%) than from either catalyst alone. These results
   indicate that a two-step biocrude treatment strategy (noncatalytic
   treatment followed by catalytic upgrading) and a two-component catalyst
   bed in the second step represents an intriguing option for the
   hydrothermal catalytic upgrading of algal biocrude. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A distance propagation method is presented for calculating tortuosity

   of using one single tortuosity value, the tortuosity distribution both
   as spatial distribution map and also statistic histogram can provide a
   more complete description. The method, which can be applied to any
   porous medium, is tested against a diffusion-based tortuosity
   calculation on two 3D microstructures: a LiCoO2 cathode electrode of
   lithium ion battery measured by x-ray nano-tomography and a lanthanum
   strontium rnanganite-ttria-stabilized zirconia, solid oxide fuel cells
   cathode measured using focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy

Abstract = {{ACL injury prevention programs often involve strengthening the knee
   muscles. We posit that an unrecognized benefit of such training is the
   associated increase in the tensile stiffness of the hypertrophied
   muscle. We tested the hypothesis that an increased quadriceps tensile
   stiffness would reduce peak anteromedial bundle (AM-)ACL relative strain
   in female knees. Twelve female cadaver knees were subjected to compound
   impulsive two-times body weight loads in compression, flexion, and
   internal tibial torque beginning at 15 degrees flexion. Knees were
   equipped with modifiable custom springs to represent the nonlinear rapid
   stretch behavior of a normal and increased stiffness female quadriceps
   (i.e., 33\% greater stiffness). Peak AM-ACL relative strain was measured
   using an in situ transducer while muscle forces and tibiofemoral
   kinematics and kinetics were recorded. A 3D ADAMS dynamic biomechanical
   knee model was used in silico to interpret the experimental results
   which were analyzed using a repeated-measures Wilcoxon test. Female
   knees exhibited a 16\% reduction in peak AM-ACL relative strain and 21\%
   reduction in change in flexion when quadriceps tensile stiffness was
   increased by 33\% (mean (SD) difference: 0.97\% (0.65\%), p=0.003). We
   conclude that increased quadriceps tensile stiffness reduces peak ACL
   strain during a controlled study simulating a pivot landing. (c) 2013

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Based on an opto-fluidic ring resonator (OFRR), a bloodless, sensitive,
   and cost-effective approach to detect glucose concentration is proposed.
   Fabrication and calibration of the OFRR sensor, as well as
   characterization of the sensor's performances are presented.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the OFRR sensor has a few unique
   features in glucose sensing, including a wide detection range of the
   glucose concentration up to 25 mM, an extremely small sample volume down
   to 100 nL, and a resolution of 0.035 mM one order of magnitude better
   than clinical requirements. Once being integrated with the fluid
   extracting system, the proposed approach can lead to a bloodless,
   sensitive and cost-effective device for frequently and accurately
   monitoring of the glucose concentration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{We present ultra-thin (6 to 31 nm) undoped amorphous silicon/organic
   hybrid solar cell structure, which can transmit desired color of light.
   The transmitted colors show great angular tolerance due to the
   negligible optical phase associated with light propagating in ultra-thin
   amorphous silicon (a-Si) layers. We achieved the power conversion
   efficiency of the hybrid cells up to 2 \%; and demonstrated that most of
   the absorbed photons in the undoped a-Si layer contributed to the
   extracted electric charges due to the suppressed electron-hole
   recombination in the ultra-thin a-Si layer. We also show the resonance
   is invariant with respect to the angle of incidence up to +/- 70 degrees
   regardless of the polarization of the incident light. Our exploration
   provides a design to realize energy harvesting colored photovoltaic
   panels for innovative applications.}},

Abstract = {{The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ)
   organic solar cell is influenced by the morphology (domain size and
   connectivity, phase purity, and interfacial structure) of the
   donor:acceptor blend active layer. The design of experiments to
   understand interrelationships between structure, transport properties,
   and device performance remains an important challenge. To this end, we
   created different types of morphologies in the poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT)/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) active layer by
   exploiting different processing strategies: conventional solvent
   casting, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) processing, and thermal
   annealing. We investigated the device characteristics and transport
   behavior (carrier densities, mobilities and recombination) of samples
   possessing comparable domain sizes, which exhibited comparable initial
   carrier densities upon illumination. Notably, however, one morphology
   exhibited PCE, short circuit current (J(SC)), and carrier mobility that
   were each approximately a factor of 3 larger than the other
   morphologies. We also investigated another case where, in spite of
   significant differences between the domain dimensions, the PCE and J(SC)
   values were quite similar. These observations are rationalized on the
   basis of interrelations between aspects of the active material
   morphology, the transport properties, and the device efficiencies. This
   work provides insight into morphological design of active layers for
   optimum device performance.}},

Abstract = {{Detergents have several biological applications but present cytotoxicity
   concerns, since they can solubilize cell membranes. Using the Ion Flux
   16, an ensemble whole cell planar patch clamp, we observed that anionic
   sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
   (CTAB), and cationic, fluorescent octadecyl rhodamine B (ORB) increased
   the membrane permeability of cells substantially within a second of
   exposure, under superfusion conditions. Increased permeability was
   irreversible for 15 min. At subsolubilizing detergent concentrations,
   patched cells showed increased membrane currents that reached a steady
   state and were intact when imaged using fluorescence microscopy. SDS
   solubilized cells at concentrations of 2 mM (2x CMC), while CTAB did not
   solubilize cells even at concentrations of 10 mM (1000x CMC). The
   relative activity for plasma membrane current induction was 1:20:14 for
   SDS, CTAB, and ORB, respectively. Under quiescent conditions, the
   relative ratio of lipid to detergent in cell membranes at the onset of
   membrane permeability was 1:7:5 for SDS, CTAB, and ORB, respectively.
   The partition constants (K) for SDS, CTAB, and ORB were 23000, 55000,
   and 39000 M-1, respectively. Combining the whole cell patch clamp data
   and XTT viability data, SDS <= 0.2 mM and CTAB and ORB <= 1 mM induced
   cell membrane permeability without causing acute toxicity.}},

Title = {{Complexity in Surfaces of Densest Packings for Families of Polyhedra}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW X}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{Packings of hard polyhedra have been studied for centuries due to their
   mathematical aesthetic and more recently for their applications in
   fields such as nanoscience, granular and colloidal matter, and biology.
   In all these fields, particle shape is important for structure and
   properties, especially upon crowding. Here, we explore packing as a
   function of shape. By combining simulations and analytic calculations,
   we study three two- parameter families of hard polyhedra and report an
   extensive and systematic analysis of the densest known packings of more
   than 55 000 convex shapes. The three families have the symmetries of
   triangle groups ( icosahedral, octahedral, tetrahedral) and interpolate
   between various symmetric solids ( Platonic, Archimedean, Catalan). We
   find optimal ( maximum) packing- density surfaces that reveal unexpected
   richness and complexity, containing as many as 132 different structures
   within a single family. Our results demonstrate the importance of
   thinking about shape not as a static property of an object, in the
   context of packings, but rather as but one point in a higher-
   dimensional shape space whose neighbors in that space may have identical
   or markedly different packings. Finally, we present and interpret our
   packing results in a consistent and generally applicable way by
   proposing a method to distinguish regions of packings and classify types
   of transitions between them.}},

Abstract = {{This work is aimed at engineering photosensitizer embedded nanoparticles
   (NPs) that produce optimal amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for
   photodynamic therapy (PDT). A revised synthetic approach, coupled with
   improved analytical tools, resulted in more efficient PDT. Specifically,
   methylene blue (MB) conjugated polyacrylamide nanoparticles (PAA NPs),
   with a polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PEGDMA, M-n 550)
   cross-linker, were synthesized so as to improve the efficacy of cancer
   PDT. The long cross-linker chain, PEGDMA, increases the distance between
   the conjugated MB molecules so. as to avoid self-quenching of the
   excited states or species, and also enhances the oxygen permeability of
   the NP matrix, when compared to the previously used shorter
   cross-linker. The overall ROS production from the MB PEGDMA PAA NPs was
   evaluated using the traditional way of monitoring the oxidation rate
   kinetics of anthracence-9,10-dipropionic acid (ADPA). We also applied
   singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) so as to selectively derive the
   singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) production rate. This analysis enabled us to
   investigate the ROS composition mix based on varied MB loading. To
   effectively obtain the correlation between the ROS productivity and the
   cell killing efficacy, a microfluidic chip device was employed to
   provide homogeneous light illumination from an LED for rapid PDT
   efficacy tests, enabling simultaneous multiple measurements while using
   only small amounts of NPs sample. This provided multiplexed,
   comprehensive PDT efficacy assays, leading to the determination of a
   near optimal loading of MB in a PAA matrix for high PDT efficacy by
   measuring the light-dose-dependent cell killing effects of the various
   MB PEGDMA PAA NPs using C6 glioma cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a coarse-graining procedure, using bead-rod chains with
   varying numbers of rods per Kuhn length (N-r,N-K), to model the
   conformational dynamics of polymer chains with bending stiffness and
   self-attraction. We find the conditions under which increased chain
   resolution leads to converged results for the effect of bending
   stiffness, attractive interaction strength (epsilon), and shearing flow
   on the conformational dynamics. As chain stiffness increases, we find a
   collapse transition that becomes steeper as attractive strength
   increases. The collapsed state depends not only on the net dimensionless
   attractive strength epsilon{*} = epsilon N-r,N-K between each Kuhn step
   of the chain but also on the ratio of bead diameter to Kuhn length
   (sigma{*}). At high epsilon{*} (>0.8/sigma{*}), collapsed globules are
   produced at moderate chain diameter sigma{*} = 1/4, while for fat chains
   with sigma{*} = 1, helices are formed, and for thin ones with sigma{*} =
   1/16, tori, folded bundles, and finally globules are formed as

Abstract = {{Compared to two-dimensional substrates, only a few methodologies exist
   for the spatially controlled decoration of three-dimensional objects,
   such as microparticles. Combining electrohydrodynamic co-jetting with
   synthetic polymer chemistry, we were able to create two- and three-patch
   microparticles displaying chemically orthogonal anchor groups on three
   distinct surface patches of the same particle. This approach takes
   advantage of a combination of novel chemically orthogonal
   polylactide-based polymers and their processing by electrohydrodynamic
   co-jetting to yield unprecedented multifunctional microparticles.
   Several micropatterned particles were fabricated displaying orthogonal
   click functionalities. Specifically, we demonstrate novel two- and
   three-patch particles. Multi-patch particles are highly sought after for
   their potential to present multiple distinct ligands in a directional
   manner. This work clearly establishes a viable route towards orthogonal
   reaction strategies on multivalent micropatterned particles.}},

Abstract = {{An array of 3 x 3 plasmonic photoconductive terahertz emitters with
   logarithmic spiral antennas is fabricated on a low temperature (LT)
   grown GaAs substrate and characterized in response to a 200 fs optical
   pump from a Ti:sapphire mode-locked laser at 800 nm wavelength. A
   microlens array is used to split and focus the optical pump beam onto
   the active area of each plasmonic photoconductive emitter element.
   Pulsed terahertz radiation with record high power levels up to 1.9 mW in
   the 0.1-2 THz frequency range is measured at an optical pump power of
   320 mW. The record high power pulsed terahertz radiation is enabled by
   the use of plasmonic contact electrodes, enhancing the photoconductor
   quantum efficiencies, and by increasing the overall device active area,
   mitigating the carrier screening effect and thermal breakdown at high
   optical pump power levels. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Sense of effort revisited: Relative contributions of sensory feedback
   and efferent copy}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{561}},
Pages = {{208-212}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Although controversial, muscular effort perception is frequently
   attributed to the efferent copy of the associated motor command. While
   peripheral/sensory information is thought to be necessary for force
   modulation/control, it is not involved in initial force production. We
   recently showed in right-handers, that perception of effort was
   asymmetric for grasp-force tasks. This asymmetry was related to
   individual differences in right and left hand strength and an intrinsic
   component. A difference in gain (input/output magnitude relationship)
   for each limb/hemisphere system was proposed as the mechanism explaining
   intrinsic asymmetries. To further investigate the relative contributions
   of efferent copy and sensory feedback to the sense of effort, vibration
   was used to distort sensory information from the muscles providing the
   reference force. Visual feedback (vision) of the reference hand force
   was also manipulated. The absolute error (AE) was generally larger in
   the vision than no-vision condition and the influence of reference hand
   vibration was significant for left hand matching of the right hand
   reference force. However, this effect was negligible when matching in
   the reverse condition. These two results may reflect an interaction
   between two phenomena: (1) visual feedback, which represents the total
   output force may not be congruent with the internal representation of
   effort associated with the efferent copy and eventually the
   proprioceptive feedback; and (2) a vibration-induced larger AE for left
   than right hand contralateral matching indicates that the contribution
   of proprioceptive feedback to force matching is significant for the left
   but not the right hand/hemisphere system. Overall, it may be suggested
   that in right-handers, the sense of effort associated with the right
   hand may be primarily based on the efferent copy while the left
   hand/hemisphere system may use a combination of efferent copy and
   proprioceptive feedback. However, the weight of each type of information
   may depend on the association between motor command and representation
   of the execution of the motor command (visual vs. internal). (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We investigate collective phenomena with rotationally driven spinners of

   either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Although the spinners
   are modeled as hard, otherwise noninteracting rigid bodies, their active
   motion induces an effective interaction that favors rotation in the same
   direction. With increasing density and activity, phase separation occurs
   via spinodal decomposition, as well as self-organization into rotating
   crystals. We observe the emergence of cooperative, superdiffusive motion
   along interfaces, which can transport inactive test particles. Our
   results demonstrate novel phase behavior of actively rotated particles
   that is not possible with linear propulsion or in nondriven, equilibrium
   systems of identical hard particles.}},

Abstract = {{We have explored C-O bond cleavage in different lignin model compounds
   in high-temperature water using catalytic amounts of water-tolerant
   Lewis acids. Experiments comparing indium triflate, scandium triflate,
   ytterbium triflate, and indium chloride indicate that indium triflate is
   the most active catalyst for this cleavage in guaiacol. Reactions of
   guaiacol at 225, 250, and 275 degrees C were consistent with first-order
   kinetics for guaiacol disappearance. The conversion reached 96\% at 275
   degrees C after 2 h using indium triflate. Milder temperatures (175,
   200, and 225 degrees C) were sufficient for selective cleavage of the
   weaker C-O bond in benzyl phenyl ether. The conversion reached 99\% at
   225 degrees C after 3 h using indium triflate. The activation energies
   for guaiacol and benzyl phenyl ether hydrolysis were found to be 134 +/-
   5 and 98 +/- 5 kJ.mol(-1), respectively. As expected, diphenyl ether was
   more resistant to C-O cleavage, but even its very strong aryl-O-aryl
   bond can be hydrolyzed to form phenol at 330 degrees C with indium
   triflate as the catalyst. These results point to the potential
   application of water-tolerant Lewis acids as catalysts for lignin
   depolymerization.}},

Title = {{Harnessing the heterogeneity of T cell differentiation fate to fine-tune
   generation of effector and memory T cells}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 19}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies show that naive T cells bearing identical T cell
   receptors experience heterogeneous differentiation and clonal expansion
   processes. The factors controlling this outcome are not well
   characterized, and their contributions to immune cell dynamics are
   similarly poorly understood. In this study, we develop a computational
   model to elaborate mechanisms occurring within and between two important
   physiological compartments, lymph nodes and blood, to determine how
   immune cell dynamics are controlled. Our multiorgan (multi-compartment)
   model integrates cellular and tissue level events and allows us to
   examine the heterogeneous differentiation of individual precursor
   cognate naiveT cells to generate both effector and memory T lymphocytes.
   Using this model, we simulate a hypothetical immune response and
   reproduce both primary and recall responses to infection. Increased
   numbers of antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DCs) are predicted to raise
   production of both effector and memoryT cells, and distinct ``sweet
   spots{''} of peptide-MHC levels on those DCs exist that favor CD4+ or
   CD8+ T cell differentiation toward either effector or memory cell
   phenotypes. This has important implications for vaccine development and
   immunotherapy.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid organic-inorganic polaritons are formed by the simultaneous
   strong coupling of two degenerate excitons and a microcavity photon at
   room temperature. Wannier-Mott and Frenkel excitons in spatially
   separated ZnO and 3,4,7,8-napthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA)
   layers, respectively, placed in a single Fabry-Perot microcavity
   contribute to the interaction with the cavity. A Rabi splitting of (322
   +/- 8) meV between the upper and middle branches of the three branch
   polariton energy-momentum dispersion is observed. This is compared to
   only (224 +/- 22) meV and (218 +/- 8) meV Rabi splittings for NTCDA-only
   and ZnO-only reference cavities, respectively, and indicates that the
   excitonic component of the polariton is a Frenkel-Wannier-Mott hybrid.
   Unlike previous reports of hybrid polaritons, the mixing of the organic
   and inorganic eigenstates occurs independently of angle due to their
   energetic degeneracy, and can be tailored by adjusting the optical field
   distribution within the cavity.}},

Title = {{Endothelial cell-derived interleukin-6 regulates tumor growth}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Endothelial cells play a complex role in the pathobiology of
   cancer. This role is not limited to the making of blood vessels to allow
   for influx of oxygen and nutrients required for the high metabolic
   demands of tumor cells. Indeed, it has been recently shown that
   tumor-associated endothelial cells secrete molecules that enhance tumor
   cell survival and cancer stem cell self-renewal. The hypothesis
   underlying this work is that specific disruption of endothelial
   cell-initiated signaling inhibits tumor growth.
   Methods: Conditioned medium from primary human dermal microvascular
   endothelial cells (HDMEC) stably transduced with silencing RNA for IL-6
   (or controls) was used to evaluate the role of endothelial-derived IL-6
   on the activation of key signaling pathways in tumor cells. In addition,
   these endothelial cells were co-transplanted with tumor cells into
   immunodefficient mice to determine the impact of endothelial
   cell-derived IL-6 on tumor growth and angiogenesis.
   Results: We observed that tumor cells adjacent to blood vessels show
   strong phosphorylation of STAT3, a key mediator of tumor progression. In
   search for a possible mechanism for the activation of the STAT3
   signaling pathway, we observed that silencing interleukin (IL)-6 in
   tumor-associated endothelial cells inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in
   tumor cells. Notably, tumors vascularized with IL-6-silenced endothelial
   cells showed lower intratumoral microvessel density, lower tumor cell
   proliferation, and slower growth than tumors vascularized with control
   endothelial cells.
   Conclusions: Collectively, these results demonstrate that IL-6 secreted
   by endothelial cells enhance tumor growth, and suggest that cancer
   patients might benefit from targeted approaches that block signaling
   events initiated by endothelial cells.}},

Abstract = {{The US shipbuilding industry faces challenges of building ships on time
   and within budgeted cost. We introduce an operational flexibility to
   shipbuilding to improve the system control. We model the flexible ship
   production system as an N' queueing network. However, the N' network
   model still lacks effective and computationally lightweight policies,
   especially with non-preemption. We use a Markov Decision Process (MDP)
   to gain structural insights into the optimal control policy. We develop
   a state dependent Optimal Threshold policy and benchmark it against
   other policies to show its excellent robustness and effectiveness. Our
   extensive test suite shows that (1) the Optimal Threshold policy
   performs the best in all the heuristics we tested; and (2) the cost of
   the system under control of this threshold policy is very close to the
   optimal cost calculated by the MDP. To calculate the exact optimal
   threshold level is difficult; therefore, we develop a birth-death
   process to determine a Analytical threshold level. Based on the optimal
   threshold values over a large test suite, we refine the analytical
   threshold level using a second-order regression model. We find the
   performance of the Regression Threshold policy to be within a few
   percent of optimal.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we consider a decision process in which vaccination is
   performed in two phases to contain the outbreak of an infectious disease
   in a set of geographic regions. In the first phase, a limited number of
   vaccine doses are allocated to each region; in the second phase,
   additional doses may be allocated to regions in which the epidemic has
   not been contained. We develop a simulation model to capture the
   epidemic dynamics in each region for different vaccination levels. We
   formulate the vaccine allocation problem as a two-stage stochastic
   linear program (2-SLP) and use the special problem structure to reduce
   it to a linear program with a similar size to that of the first stage
   problem. We also present a Newsvendor model formulation of the problem
   which provides a closed form solution for the optimal allocation. We
   construct test cases motivated by vaccine planning for seasonal
   influenza in the state of North Carolina. Using the 2-SLP formulation,
   we estimate the value of the stochastic solution and the expected value
   of perfect information. We also propose and test an easy to implement
   heuristic for vaccine allocation. We show that our proposed two-phase
   vaccination policy potentially results in a lower attack rate and a
   considerable saving in vaccine production and administration cost. (C)

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{150-160}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The interaction of lattice dislocations with grain boundaries in proton-
   and ion-irradiated austenitic stainless steels is investigated. At the
   macroscale, interactions of dislocation channels with grain boundaries
   result in slip blockage, slip transmission and slip along the grain
   boundary with an associated in-plane displacement. At the dislocation
   level, slip transmission prediction is governed by the strain energy
   density minimization. However, the importance of the local resolved
   shear stress increases, in the sense that it must be of sufficient
   magnitude to propagate the dislocations through the damaged matrix. If
   this condition is not satisfied, the grain boundary will activate an
   alternative mechanism to relieve the strain accumulated from
   accommodation of lattice dislocations and the stress concentration
   associated with the formation of a dislocation pile-up. One observed
   relief mechanism involves the nucleation and propagation of a crack
   along the grain boundary, which is accompanied by an out-of-plane
   displacement of the boundary. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{This paper outlines a method for optimizing the design of a lithium-ion
   battery pack for hybrid vehicle applications using a hybrid numerical
   optimization method that combines multiple individual optimizers. A
   gradient-free optimizer (ALPSO) is coupled with a gradient-based
   optimizer (SNOPT) to solve a mixed-integer nonlinear battery pack design
   problem. This method enables maximizing the properties of a battery pack
   subjected to multiple safety and performance constraints. The
   optimization framework is applied to minimize the mass, volume and
   material costs. The optimized pack design satisfies the energy and power
   constraints exactly and shows 13.9-18\% improvement in battery pack
   properties over initial designs. The optimal pack designs also performed
   better in driving cycle tests, resulting in 23.1-32.8\% increase in
   distance covered per unit of battery performance metric, where the
   metric is either mass, volume or material cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A Ni/Sm0.2Ce0.8O1 (sDc) composite was employed as anode material for
   direct electrochemical oxidation (DEO) of dry CH4 in a solid oxide fuel
   cell. The anodic performance was investigated at temperatures between
   600 degrees C and 700 degrees C using SDC as electrolyte material and
   Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) as cathode material. The single cell
   exhibited maximum power densities of 671 mW cm(-2), 494 mW cm(-2) and
   305 mW cm(-2) in dry CH4 at 700 degrees C, 650 degrees C and 600 degrees
   C, respectively. Remarkably, at 700 degrees C the power density in CH4
   was higher than in H-2, thanks to the carbon tolerance of the anode.
   Durability tests under constant 300 mA output current showed only 3.7\%
   performance loss after 72 h operation. The results demonstrate that
   Ni/SDC can be used as anode for the DEO of dry CH4 even at temperatures
   as low as 600 degrees C. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{248}},
Pages = {{789-808}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical behavior of lithium-ion battery modules is investigated by
   conducting tensile tests of the module components, constrained
   compression tests of dry module representative volume element (RVE)
   specimens, and a constrained punch test of a small-scale dry module
   specimen. The results of tensile tests of the module components are used
   to characterize the tensile behavior of module specimens. The results
   in-plane constrained compression tests of module RVE specimens indicate
   that the load carrying capacity is characterized by the buckling of the
   module components and the final densification of the module components,
   and the nominal stress-strain curves appear to be independent of the
   specimen height. The results of different compressive nominal
   stress-strain curves in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions
   indicate the module RVE specimens are anisotropic. The results of a
   buckling analysis of the module RVE specimens under in-plane constrained
   compression are in agreement with the experimental results. The module
   RVE specimen is dominated by the buckling of the aluminum heat
   dissipater sheet under in-plane constrained compression. Finally, the
   results of a constrained punch test of a module specimen are in
   agreement with those of the corresponding finite element analyses based
   on a macroscopic homogenized foam material model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Properties of supporting electrolytes and solvents were examined for use
   with vanadium acetylacetonate - a member of the class of
   metal(beta-diketonate) active species - in non-aqueous redox flow
   batteries. Twenty supporting-electrolyte/solvent combinations were
   screened for ionic conductivity and supporting-electrolyte solubility.
   Hexane, tetrahydrofuran, and dimethylcarbonate solvents did not meet
   minimal conductivity and solubility criteria for any of the electrolytes
   used, which included tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate,
   tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, tetrabutylammonium
   hexafluorophosphate, and (1-butyl, 3-methyl)imidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. Ionic conductivities and
   solubilities for solutions of these electrolytes passed screening
   criteria in acetonitrile and dimethylformamide solvents, in which
   maximum supporting-electrolyte and active-species solubilities were
   determined. Active-species electrochemistry was found to be reversible
   in several solvent/support systems; for some systems the voltammetric
   signatures of unwanted side reactions were suppressed. Correlations
   between supporting-solution properties and performance metrics suggest
   that an optimal solvent for a vanadium acetylacetonate RFB should have a
   low solvent molar volume for active-species solubility, and a high
   Hansen polarity for conductivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Regularized thin-fiber model for nanofiber formation by centrifugal
   spinning}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{We propose a regularized thin-fiber (string) model that overcomes past
   numerical limitations and allows determination of the steady fiber
   velocity and diameter of a semi-infinite Newtonian viscous fiber
   emerging from a nozzle rotating about an axis in the presence of
   centrifugal, inertial, and viscous forces of arbitrary magnitudes. The
   results are controlled by two dimensionless groups, namely, the Rossby
   number Rb expressing the ratio of inertial to centrifugal forces and the
   Reynolds number Re, the ratio of inertial to viscous forces. We find
   that for Rb < 0.5 and Re < 1, regularization of the string-model
   equations is required to provide numerical stability, which we achieve.
   Solutions are thereby obtained in which viscosity reduces curvature in
   the fiber trajectory; these solutions asymptotically approach the
   inviscid solution at large distances along the spin line. Thus, long
   spin lines reach a diameter that is independent of viscosity, as long as
   the fiber is sufficiently long, a criterion that is made clear in the
   paper. At Rb > 0.5, regularization is not required, the curvature in
   fiber trajectory is increased by viscosity, and the solution at large
   distances along the spin line does not converge to the inviscid result.
   Regimes of behavior in the plane formed by Re and Rb are mapped out and
   example behavior is given for each regime.}},

Abstract = {{Using ab initio molecular dynamics, the atomic structure and transport
   properties of eutectic Ga-In and Ga-In-Sn are investigated. The
   Kubo-Greenwood (K-G) and the Ziman-Faber (Z-F) formulations and the
   Wiedemann-Franz (W-F) law are used for the electrical and electronic
   thermal conductivity. The species diffusivity and the viscosity are also
   predicted using the mean square displacement and the Stokes-Einstein
   (S-E) relation. Alloying Ga causes more disordered structure, i.e.,
   broadening the atomic distance near the In and Sn atoms, which reduces
   the transport properties and the melting temperature. The K-G treatment
   shows excellent agreement with the experimental results while Z-F
   treatment formula slightly overestimates the electrical conductivity.
   The predicted thermal conductivity also shows good agreement with the
   experiments. The species diffusivity and the viscosity are slightly
   reduced by the alloying of Ga with In and Sn atoms. Good agreements are
   found with available experimental results and new predicted
   transport-property results are provided. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Corrosion of metal in biomedical devices could cause serious health
   problems to patients. Currently ceramics coating materials used in metal
   implants can reduce corrosion to some extent with limitations. Here we
   proposed graphene as a biocompatible protective film for metal
   potentially for biomedical application. We confirmed graphene
   effectively inhibits Cu surface from corrosion in different biological
   aqueous environments. Results from cell viability tests suggested that
   graphene greatly eliminates the toxicity of Cu by inhibiting corrosion
   and reducing the concentration of Cu2+ ions produced. We demonstrated
   that additional thiol derivatives assembled on graphene coated Cu
   surface can prominently enhance durability of sole graphene protection
   limited by the defects in graphene film. We also demonstrated that
   graphene coating reduced the immune response to metal in a clinical
   setting for the first time through the lymphocyte transformation test.
   Finally, an animal experiment showed the effective protection of
   graphene to Cu under in vivo condition. Our results open up the
   potential for using graphene coating to protect metal surface in
   biomedical application.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of a small isolated hydrate-free inclusion (a gas bubble)
   within a porous matrix filled with methane hydrate and either water or
   methane gas is analyzed. Simplifying assumptions of spherical symmetry,
   an infinite uniform porous medium, and negligible effects of background
   temperature and pressure variations focus the investigation on the
   features of the dynamics of a single bubble determined by a phase
   transition. Two solutions are presented: an exact solution of the Stefan
   problem obtained when the effects of gas and water flow are neglected,
   and a numerical solution of the full problem. The solutions are in good
   agreement with each other and with known asymptotic dependencies,
   confirming that the effects of inertia and convection transport can be
   neglected in the case of small inclusions. It is found that, after an
   initial adjustment, the radius of any small bubble decreases with time
   following a self-similar solution of the Stefan problem. The lifetime of
   a bubble is evaluated as a function of initial radius and the system's
   physical parameters. Possible effects of such inclusions on the
   filtration of methane to the surface and other aspects of the dynamics
   of hydrate-bearing deposits are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{van der Waals density functional theory (vdW-DFT) and semiempirical
   grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) calculations are used to predict the
   thermodynamics and methane storage capacity of 18 metal-substituted
   variants of the metal organic framework (MOF) M-DOBDC (DOBDC =
   2,5-oxidobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate). Methane adsorption enthalpies
   (Delta H) on the benchmark Mg- and Ni- DOBDC systems were calculated
   using several vdW-DFT methods. The vdW-DF2 scheme was found to yield the
   best agreement with experiments, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of
   2.7 kJ/mol. Applying this functional across the entire M-DOBDC series,
   it is observed that Delta H varies from -16 to -34 kJ/mol. These
   enthalpies are 10-20 kJ/mol less exothermic than that for CO2 adsorption
   in M-DOBDC, consistent with a g weaker, dispersion-based CH4-MOF
   interaction. In parallel with these thermodynamic analyses, methane
   adsorption isotherms for five benchmark M-DOBDC MOFs were evaluated
   using several established interatomic potentials. An uncharged,
   single-site model for CH4 yielded the best agreement with experiments,
   with a MAD of 16 cm(3)/cm(3). This potential was subsequently employed
   to predict methane capacities across the remainder of the M-DOBDC
   series, With additional comparisons to other prominent MOFs such as
   MOF-5, PCN-11, PCN-14, and HKUST-1. Finally, the amount of usable stored
   methane was examined for two operating scenarios: isothermal pressure
   swing (PS) and a combined temperature/pressure swing (TPS). Under these
   conditions, PCN-11 and Be-DOBDC yield the best combination of
   gravimetric and volumetric methane densities at pressures below similar
   to 50 bar, while MOP-5 is best at higher pressures. We conclude that
   enhanced binding sites, such as coordinatively unsaturated metal sites,
   can be detrimental for PS operation at higher pressures due to their
   tendency to retain adsorbed methane at low (desorption) pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental and energy security concerns have motivated an increased
   focus on developing clean, efficient combustors, which increasingly
   relies on insight into the combustion chemistry of fuels. In particular,
   naphthenes (cycloalkanes and alkylcycloalkanes) are important chemical
   components of distillate fuels, such as diesel and jet fuels. As such,
   there is a growing interest in describing napthene reactivity with
   kinetic mechanisms. Use of these mechanisms in predictive combustion
   models aids in the development of combustors. This study focuses on the
   pyrolysis of n-butylcydohexane (n-BCH), an important representative of
   naphthenes in jet fuels. Seven different unimolecular decomposition
   pathways of C C bond fission were explored utilizing ab initio/DFT
   methods. Accurate reaction energies were computed using the high-level
   quantum composite G3B3 method. Variational transition state theory,
   Rice-Ramsperger Kassel-Marcus/master equation simulations provided
   temperature- and pressure-dependent rate constants. Implementation of
   these pathways into an existing chemical kinetic mechanism improved the
   prediction of experimental OH radical and H2O speciation in shock tube
   oxidation. Simulations of this combustion showed a change in the
   expected decomposition chemistry of n-BCH, predicting increased
   production of cyclic alkyl radicals instead of straight-chain alkenes.
   The most prominent reaction pathway for the decomposition of n-BCH is
   n-BCH = C3H7 + C-7-H-13. The results of this study provide insight into
   the combustion of n-BCH and will aid in the future development of
   naphthene kinetic mechanisms.}},

   with Hybrid ZnO@TiO2 as Blue Emitters}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{White quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs) have been a promising
   candidate for high-efficiency and color-saturated displays. However, it
   is challenging to integrate various QD emitters into one device and also
   to obtain efficient blue QDs. Here, we report a simply
   solution-processed white QD-LED using a hybrid ZnO@TiO2 as electron
   injection layer and ZnCdSeS QD emitters. The white emission is obtained
   by integrating the yellow emission from QD emitters and the blue
   emission generated from hybrid ZnO@TiO2 layer. We show that the
   performance of white QD-LEDs can be adjusted by controlling the driving
   force for hole transport and electroluminescence recombination region
   via varying the thickness of hole transport layer. The device is
   demonstrated with a maximum luminance of 730 cd/m(2) and power
   efficiency of 1.7 lm/W, exhibiting the Commission Internationale de
   l'Enclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.33, 0.33). The unencapsulated white
   QD-LED has a long lifetime of 96 h at its initial luminance of 730
   cd/m(2), primarily due to the fact that the device with hybrid ZnO@TiO2
   has low leakage current and is insensitive to the oxygen and the
   moisture. These results indicate that hybrid ZnO@TiO2 provides an
   alternate and effective approach to achieve high-performance white
   QD-LEDs and also other optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to control the wetting properties of a polymeric liquid on a
   given surface is important for several emerging technological
   applications including protective coatings, lubricants and sensors. Here
   we show that star-shaped polystyrene (PS) molecules exhibit notably
   different wetting properties than their linear analogues of the same
   chemical structure and their wetting properties can be controlled
   through changes of their functionality f (number of arms per molecule).
   Unlike linear chains, the wetting of star-shaped macromolecules is
   determined by the competition between entropic forces. Wetting is
   enhanced due to reductions in the loss of entropy upon adsorption of the
   stars with increasing f; soft colloidal-like entropic repulsion effects
   suppress the ability of the stars to exhibit a high degree of surface
   adsorption and to efficiently pack, for sufficiently large values of f.
   This phenomenon is manifested in the existence of a minimum in the
   macroscopic contact angle and other related microscopic parameters
   embodied in the effective interface potential as a function of f.}},

Journal = {{OPTICS EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{2910-2924}},

Abstract = {{The state mixings necessary to mediate three new optical non-linearities
   are shown to arise simultaneously and automatically in a 2-level atom
   with an l = 0 ground state and an l = 1 excited state that undergoes a
   sequence of electric and magnetic dipole-allowed transitions. The
   treatment is based on an extension of dressed state theory that includes
   quantized electric and magnetic field interactions. Magneto-electric
   rectification, transverse magnetization, and second-harmonic generation
   are shown to constitute a family of nonlinear effects that can take
   place regardless of whether inversion is a symmetry of the initial
   unperturbed system or not. Interactions driven jointly by the optical
   electric and magnetic fields produce dynamic symmetry-breaking that
   accounts for the frequency, the intensity dependence, and the
   polarization of induced magnetization in prior experiments. This strong
   field quantum model explains not only how a driven 2-level system may
   develop nonlinear dipole moments that are forbidden between or within
   its stationary states, but it also broadens the class of materials
   suitable for optical energy conversion applications and magnetic field
   generation with light so as to include all transparent dielectrics.

Abstract = {{There is a large body of literature describing molecular level
   interactions between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and macrophages.
   Macrophages initiate a range of anti-bacterial mechanisms in response to
   infection, and Mtb is capable of surviving and circumventing many of
   these responses. We apply a computational approach to ask: what are the
   effects on the cellular level of these opposing interactions? The model
   considers the interplay between bacterial killing and the pathogen's
   interference with macrophage function. The results reveal an oscillating
   balance between host and pathogen, but the balance is transient and
   varies in length, indicating that stochasticity in the bacterial
   population or host response could contribute to the diverse incubation
   periods observed in exposed individuals. The model captures host and
   strain variation and gives new insight into host-pathogen compatibility
   and co-evolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmas in bubbles in water are being investigated for their ability to
   produce chemically reactive species for water purification and medical
   treatment. The gas forming the bubble is potentially a design parameter
   for water purification as the type and rate of production of active
   species may be controllable by the type of gas in the bubble. In this
   paper, we report on a computational investigation of the dynamics of
   plasmas in bubbles in water sustained in different gases. Images,
   optical spectra and plasma properties are discussed for plasmas in
   bubbles of N-2, Ar and He in water, and compared to experiments. The
   differences in plasma dynamics and spatial distribution of the plasma
   (e.g., volume discharge or surface hugging) when using different gases
   depend in large part on the electron energy relaxation length, and the
   rate of diffusion of water vapour into the interior of the bubble.
   Electron impact dissociative excitation of water vapour, electron impact
   excitation of dissociation products and excitation transfer from the
   plasma excited injected bubble gases to water vapour all contribute to
   plasma emission. Variations in the contributions of these processes are
   responsible for differences in the observed optical spectra and
   differences in radical production.}},

Abstract = {{We report a facile synthesis route to prepare high-quality Pt3Co
   nanocubes with a concave structure, and further demonstrate that these
   concave Pt3Co nanocubes are terminated with high-index crystal facets.
   The success of this preparation is highly dependent on an appropriate
   nucleation process with a successively anisotropic overgrowth and a
   preservation of the resultant high-index planes by control binding of
   oleyl-amine/oleic acid with a fine-tuned composition. Using a
   hydrogenation of styrene as a model reaction, these Pt3Co concave
   nanocubes as a new class of nanocatalysts with more open structure and
   active atomic sites located on their high-index crystallographic planes
   exhibit an enhanced catalytic activity in comparison with low-indexed
   surface terminated Pt3Co nanocubes in similar size.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the formation and evolution of ripples on
   focused-ion-beam (FIB) irradiated compound semiconductor surfaces. Using
   initially normal-incidence Ga+ FIB irradiation of InSb, we tuned the
   local beam incidence angle (theta(eff)) by varying the pitch and/or
   dwell time. For single-pass FIB irradiation, increasing theta(eff)
   induces morphological evolution from pits and islands to ripples to
   featureless surfaces. Multiple-pass FIB irradiation of the rippled
   surfaces at a fixed theta(eff) leads to island formation on the ripple
   crests, followed by nanorod (NR) growth. This ripple-NR transition
   provides an alternative approach for achieving dense arrays of NRs. (C)

Abstract = {{We show over 100-fold enhancement of the exciton oscillator strength as
   the diameter of an InGaN nanodisk in a GaN nanopillar is reduced from a

   nanodisks less than 100 nm in diameter. Meanwhile, the radiative decay
   rate is only improved by 10 folds due to strong reduction of the local
   density of photon states in small nanodisks. Further increase in the
   radiative decay rate can be achieved by engineering the local density of
   photon states, such as adding a dielectric coating. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{The microstructure in the intermediate layer of a laser-welded Cu-Al lap

   morphology and composition in the intermediate layer of the weld joint.
   Banded and cellular structures were observed in the hypereutectic zone;
   a lamellar structure was found in the eutectic zone which was the
   narrowest zone with the finest microstructure; a dendritic structure was
   obtained in the hypoeutectic zone with the coarsest microstructure and
   widest zone. The joint faulted in the dendritic hypoeutectic zone, under
   a combination of brittle and shear mode in the fracture surface. The
   maximum shear load of the Cu-Al joint decreased with increasing primary
   dendrite arm spacing and the growth of secondary dendrite in the
   hypoeutectic zone, which was induced by increasing laser power. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Using epitaxy and the misfit strain imposed by an underlying substrate,
   it is possible to elastically strain oxide thin films to percent
   levels-far beyond where they would crack in bulk. Under such strains,
   the properties of oxides can be dramatically altered. In this article,
   we review the use of elastic strain to enhance ferroics, materials
   containing domains that can be moved through the application of an
   electric field (ferroelectric), a magnetic field (ferromagnetic), or
   stress (ferroelastic). We describe examples of transmuting oxides that
   are neither ferroelectric nor ferromagnetic in their unstrained state
   into ferroelectrics, ferromagnets, or materials that are both at the
   same time (multiferroics). Elastic strain can also be used to enhance
   the properties of known ferroic oxides or to create new tunable
   microwave dielectrics with performance that rivals that of existing
   materials. Results show that for thin films of ferroic oxides, elastic
   strain is a viable alternative to the traditional method of chemical
   substitution to lower the energy of a desired ground state relative to
   that of competing ground states to create materials with superior
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Composite materials of porous pyrolyzed
   polyacrylonitrile-sulfur@graphene nanosheet (pPAN-S@GNS) are fabricated
   through a bottom-up strategy. Microspherical particles are formed by
   spray drying of a mixed aqueous colloid of PAN nanoparticles and
   graphene nanosheets, followed by a simple heat treatment with elemental
   sulfur. The pPAN-S primary nanoparticles are wrapped homogeneously and
   loosely within a three-dimensional network of graphene nanosheets (GNS).
   The hierarchical pPAN-S@GNS composite shows a high reversible capacity
   of 1449.3 mAhg(sulfur)(-1) or 681.2 mAhg(composite)(-1) in the second
   cycle; after 300 cycles at a 0.2 C charge/discharge rate the capacity
   retention is 88.8\% of its initial reversible value. Additionally, the
   coulombic efficiency (CE) during cycling is near 100 \%, apart from in
   the first cycle, in which CE is 81.1 \%. A remarkable capacity of near
   700 mAhg(sulfur)(-1) is obtained, even at a high discharge rate of 10 C.
   The superior performance of pPAN-S@GNS is ascribed to the spherical
   secondary GNS structure that creates an electronically conductive 3D
   framework and also reinforces structural stability.}},

Abstract = {{The second Radio Aurora Explorer (RAX-2) satellite has completed more
   than 30 conjunction experiments with the Advanced Modular Incoherent
   Scatter Radar chain of incoherent scatter radars in Alaska and Resolute
   Bay, Canada. Coherent radar echoing occurred during four of the passes:
   three when E region electron drifts exceeded the ion acoustic speed
   threshold and one during HF heating of the ionosphere by the High
   Frequency Active Auroral Research Program heater. In this paper, we
   present the results for the first three passes associated with
   backscatter from natural irregularities. We analyze, in detail, the
   largest drift case because the plasma turbulence was the most intense
   and because the corresponding ground-to-space bistatic scattering
   geometry was the most favorable for magnetic aspect sensitivity
   analysis. A set of data analysis procedures including interference
   removal, autocorrelation analysis, and the application of a radar beam
   deconvolution algorithm mapped the distribution of E region backscatter
   with 3 km resolution in altitude and approximate to 0.1 degrees in
   magnetic aspect angle. To our knowledge, these are the highest
   resolution altitude-resolved magnetic aspect sensitivity measurements
   made at UHF frequencies in the auroral region. In this paper, we show
   that despite the large electron drift speed of approximate to 1500 m/s,
   the magnetic aspect sensitivity of submeter scale irregularities is much
   higher than previously reported. The root-mean-square of the aspect
   angle distribution varied monotonically between 0.5 degrees and 0.1
   degrees for the altitude range 100-110 km. Findings from this single but
   compelling event suggest that submeter scale waves propagating at larger
   angles from the main ExB flow direction (secondary waves) have parallel
   electric fields that are too small to contribute to E region electron
   heating. It is possible that anomalous electron heating in the auroral
   electrojet can be explained by (a) the dynamics of those submeter scale
   waves propagating in the ExB direction (primary waves) or (b) the
   dynamics of longer wavelengths.}},

Title = {{Leveraging GPUs Using Cooperative Loop Speculation}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Graphics processing units, or GPUs, provide TFLOPs of additional
   performance potential in commodity computer systems that frequently go
   unused by most applications. Even with the emergence of languages such
   as CUDA and OpenCL, programming GPUs remains a difficult challenge for a
   variety of reasons, including the inherent algorithmic characteristics
   and data structure choices used by applications as well as the tedious
   performance optimization cycle that is necessary to achieve high
   performance. The goal of this work is to increase the applicability of
   GPUs beyond CUDA/OpenCL to implicitly data-parallel applications written
   in C/C++ using speculative parallelization. To achieve this goal, we
   propose Paragon: a static/dynamic compiler platform to speculatively run
   possibly data-parallel portions of sequential applications on the GPU
   while cooperating with the system CPU. For such loops, Paragon utilizes
   the GPU in an opportunistic way while orchestrating a cooperative
   relation between the CPU and GPU to reduce the overhead of
   miss-speculations. Paragon monitors the dependencies for the loops
   running speculatively on the GPU and nonspeculatively on the CPU using a
   lightweight distributed conflict detection designed specifically for
   GPUs, and transfers the execution to the CPU in case a conflict is
   detected. Paragon resumes the execution on the GPU after the CPU
   resolves the dependency. Our experiments show that Paragon achieves 4x
   on average and up to 30x speedup compared to unsafe CPU execution with
   four threads and 7x on average and up to 64x speedup versus sequential
   execution across a set of sequential but implicitly data-parallel
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Internet protocol television (IPTV), which is rapidly growing in
   popularity, can provide hundreds of channels; but the very number of
   channels, and the delay in switching between them due to network
   bandwidth limitations, can make it difficult for viewers to find the
   content they want. To address these problems, this paper presents a
   novel scheme that identifies `hot' channels, those likely to be watched
   in the near future by a target viewer. Then, the scheme actively
   maintains a list of hot channels, and a second list of cold channels.
   Channels are allocated to one of the lists based on their recent
   popularity across all IPTV viewers and the target viewer's own viewing
   history. The hot list is searched first during channel navigation, and
   hot channels are also prefetched in low resolution to support a preview
   mode; this combination usually reduces zapping time substantially, even
   if network bandwidth is limited. A prototype architecture of the
   proposed scheme is developed. Experimental results show that the
   proposed scheme significantly improves channel seek time compared to
   adjacency-based prefetching, popularity-based prefetching,
   popularity-based arrangement, or a simple numerical ordering(1).}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence has unveiled a subpopulation of highly tumorigenic,
   multipotent cells capable of self-renewal in head and neck squamous cell
   carcinomas (HNSCCs). These unique cells, named here cancer stem cells
   (CSCs), proliferate slowly and might be involved in resistance to
   conventional chemotherapy. We have shown that CSCs are found in
   perivascular niches and rely on endothelial cell-secreted factors
   {[}particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6)] for their survival and
   self-renewal in HNSCC. Here, we hypothesized that cisplatin enhances the
   stem cell fraction in HNSCC. To address this hypothesis, we generated
   xenograft HNSCC tumors with University of Michigan-squamous cell
   carcinoma 22B (UM-SCC-22B) cells and observed that cisplatin treatment
   increased (P = .0013) the fraction of CSCs {[}i.e., aldehyde
   dehydrogenase activity high and cluster of differentiation 44 high
   (ALDH(high)CD44(high))]. Cisplatin promoted self-renewal and survival of
   CSCs in vitro, as seen by an increase in the number of orospheres in
   ultralow attachment plates and induction in B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion
   region 1 homolog (Bmi-1) and octamer-binding transcription factor 4

Title = {{On the nonuniqueness of sediment yield at the catchment scale: The
   effects of soil antecedent conditions and surface shield}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1025-1045}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The understanding of reasons leading to nonuniqueness of soil erosion
   susceptibility is still inadequate, yet indispensable for establishing
   general relations between runoff volume and sediment yield. To obtain
   relevant insights, we performed a series of numerical simulations with a
   detailed hydrodynamic model using synthetic storms of varying intensity,
   duration, and lag time between events as representations of different
   hydrologic response conditions in a zero-order catchment. The design
   targeted to generate surface flow and perturb soil substrate by a first
   rainfall event, creating a set of initial conditions in terms of flow
   and deposited sediment prior to the onset of a subsequent rainfall
   event. Due to the differential effect of (re)detachment and
   (re)entrainment processes on soil particles of varying sizes, the
   deposited sediment mass formed shielding layer. One of the essential
   results is that unless the initial condition of flow and sediment is
   identical, the same volume of runoff can generate different total
   sediment yields and their variation can reach up to approximate to
   200\%. The effect is attributed to two major conflicting effects exerted
   by the deposited initialization (soil antecedent condition) sediment
   mass: erosion enhancement, because of supply of highly erodible
   sediment, and erosion impediment, because of constrain on the
   availability of lighter particles by heavier sediment. Consistently with
   this inference, long-term simulations with continuous rainfall show that
   a peculiar feature of sediment yield series is the existence of maximum
   before the steady state is reached. The two characteristic time scales,
   the time to peak and the time to steady state, separate three
   characteristic periods that correspond to flow-limited, source-limited,
   and steady-state regimes. These time scales are log linearly and
   negatively related to the spatially averaged Shields parameter: the
   smaller the rainfall input and the heavier a given particle is, the
   larger the two scales are. The results provide insights on how the
   existence of shield operates on erosion processes, possibly implying
   that accurate short-term predictions of geomorphic events from headwater
   areas may never become a tractable problem: the latter would require a
   detailed spatial characterization of particle size distribution prior to
   precipitation events.

Abstract = {{There are a growing number of large-scale, complex hydrologic models
   that are capable of simulating integrated surface and subsurface flow.
   Many are coupled to land-surface energy balance models, biogeochemical
   and ecological process models, and atmospheric models. Although they are
   being increasingly applied for hydrologic prediction and environmental
   understanding, very little formal verification and/or benchmarking of
   these models has been performed. Here we present the results of an
   intercomparison study of seven coupled surface-subsurface models based
   on a series of benchmark problems. All the models simultaneously solve
   adapted forms of the Richards and shallow water equations, based on
   fully 3-D or mixed (1-D vadose zone and 2-D groundwater) formulations
   for subsurface flow and 1-D (rill flow) or 2-D (sheet flow)
   conceptualizations for surface routing. A range of approaches is used
   for the solution of the coupled equations, including global implicit,
   sequential iterative, and asynchronous linking, and various strategies
   are used to enforce flux and pressure continuity at the
   surface-subsurface interface. The simulation results show good agreement
   for the simpler test cases, while the more complicated test cases bring
   out some of the differences in physical process representations and
   numerical solution approaches between the models. Benchmarks with more
   traditional runoff generating mechanisms, such as excess infiltration
   and saturation, demonstrate more agreement between models, while
   benchmarks with heterogeneity and complex water table dynamics highlight
   differences in model formulation. In general, all the models demonstrate
   the same qualitative behavior, thus building confidence in their use for
   hydrologic applications.
   Key Points
   <list list-type={''}bulleted{''}> Seven hydrologic models were
   intercompared on standard benchmark problems In general, though there
   are differences in approach, these models agree Model differences can be
   attributed to solution technique and coupling strategy}},

   Knee Braced Truss Moment Frames}},

Abstract = {{A performance evaluation of a structural steel framing system called
   Buckling-Restrained Knee Braced Truss Moment Frame (BRKB-TMF) was
   conducted. This structural system combines the advantages of open-web
   steel truss girders and Buckling Restrained Braces (BRBs). Key
   advantages of open-web trusses include light weight, simple connections,
   and open passages for mechanical ductwork and pipes. In this system, the
   open-web trusses are designed to be elastic, while the BRBs are
   strategically placed and designed to dissipate seismic energy. The
   combined features of the open-web trusses and BRBs lead to a system with
   enhanced performance, safety, and economy. In this study, a performance
   based design procedure was developed for the proposed system. A four
   story building structure was selected as a study case. The structure
   designed using the presented procedure was subjected to nonlinear static
   (pushover) and dynamic analyses. The pushover analysis was performed to
   determine the overall response, the sequence of inelastic activity
   leading to collapse, and the failure mechanism. In the nonlinear dynamic
   analyses, the study frame was subjected to a suite of selected
   earthquake records scaled to represent various levels of earthquake
   ground motion intensity. An incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) approach
   was applied to examine the behavior of the structure at different levels
   of ground motion intensity including the collapse level. Using IDA
   results, fragility curves were created and examined. The results were
   used to assess the collapse margin of the structure. The analyses
   provided very promising results in terms of the effectiveness and
   robustness of the system. The example structure showed a low probability
   for collapse under the maximum considered earthquake (MCE) ground
   motions. The key design parameters were determined to be the target
   drift and deformation capacity of the BRBs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   cell-by-cell basis at each time step over an unstructured, triangular
   grid and determines the appropriate solution method for each individual
   cell. Several case studies are shown that illustrate the adaptive
   kinematic-dynamic model's flexibility and robustness. The effects of the
   user-defined limit for the kinematic wave approximation and the abrupt
   switch from one solver to another are explored for the adaptive
   kinematic-dynamic model.}},

Abstract = {{This note provides a solution to the constrained command tracking
   problem using reference governors for a class of continuous-time second
   order linear systems with an input delay and with pointwise-in-time
   state and control constraints. The reference governor modifies the
   command to a closed-loop system based on the prediction of whether the
   system response to constant commands violates the specified constraints.
   The solution relies on classical control results for second order linear
   systems and requires only checking whether predicted outputs violate the
   constraints at a small number of time instants (e.g., four time instants
   in the single output case). This greatly simplifies the online
   computation, especially when a reference governor is applied to system
   models that are (slowly) changing in time. The effectiveness of the
   proposed method is demonstrated by a numerical example. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The uterine suspensory tissue (UST), which includes the cardinal (CL)
   and uterosacral ligaments (USL), plays an important role in resisting
   pelvic organ prolapse (POP). We describe a technique for quantifying the
   in vivo time-dependent force-displacement behavior of the UST,
   demonstrate its feasibility, compare data from POP patients to normal
   subjects previously reported, and use the results to identify the
   properties of the CL and USL via biomechanical modeling. Fourteen women
   with prolapse, without prior surgeries, who were scheduled for surgery,
   were selected from an ongoing study on POP. We developed a
   computer-controlled linear servo actuator, which applied a continuous
   force and simultaneously recorded cervical displacement. Immediately
   prior to surgery, the apparatus was used to apply three ``ramp and
   hold{''} trials. After a 1.1 N preload was applied to remove slack in
   the UST, a ramp rate of 4 mm/s was used up to a maximum force of 17.8 N.
   Each trial was analyzed and compared with the tissue stiffness and
   energy absorbed during the ramp phase and normalized final force during
   the hold phase. A simplified four-cable model was used to analyze the
   material behavior of each ligament. The mean +/- SD stiffnesses of the
   UST were 0.49 +/- 0.13, 0.61 +/- 0.22, and 0.59 +/- 0.2 N/mm from trial
   1 to 3, with the latter two values differing significantly from the
   first. The energy absorbed significantly decreased from trial 1 (0.27
   +/- 0.07) to 2 (0.23 +/- 0.08) and 3 (0.22 +/- 0.08 J) but not from
   trial 2 to 3. The normalized final relaxation force increased
   significantly with trial 1. Modeling results for trial 1 showed that the
   stiffnesses of CL and USL were 0.20 +/- 0.06 and 0.12 +/- 0.04 N/mm,
   respectively. Under the maximum load applied in this study, the strain
   in the CL and USL approached about 100\%. In the relaxation phase, the
   peak force decreased by 44 +/- 4\% after 60 s. A servo actuator
   apparatus and intraoperative testing strategy proved successful in
   obtaining in vivo time-dependent material properties data in
   representative sample of POP. The UST exhibited visco-hyperelastic
   behavior. Unlike a knee ligament, the length of UST could stretch to
   twice their initial length under the maximum force applied in this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid-feed flame spray pyrolysis provides easily dispersed,
   unaggregated nanopowders with average particle sizes of 20-70 nm
   depending on the processing conditions. Their chemical compositions can
   be controlled to ppm levels via control of the initial precursor
   solution. In this paper, Y3Al5O12 composition nanopowders are produced
   that are atomically mixed but offer a hexagonal crystal structure rather
   than a YAG structure. Y2O3 and -Al2O3 nanopowders are also produced and
   mixed to evaluate reactive sintering. It is shown that
   nanopowder/polymer mixtures permit the extrusion of tubes that retain
   their shape on debindering and sintering to 95\% theoretical density.
   More importantly, the sintering behavior of hex-Y3Al5O12 is compared
   with that of tubes formed using 3:5 Y2O3:-Al2O3 mixtures to test the
   so-called bottom-up paradigm, which suggests that mixing on the finest
   length scales should provide optimal control of sintering rates, final
   densities, and grain sizes. Instead, it is found that reactive sintering
   is faster and offers better control of final grain sizes. Dense sintered
   tubes are translucent, and dimensional uniformity is maintained from
   extrusion through sintering.}},

Abstract = {{Hospitals must maintain safe nurse-to-patient ratios in patient care
   units to offer adequate and safe patient care. Since the patient demand
   is highly variable, during high patient demand periods temporary or
   overtime nurses are hired to ensure safe nurse-to-patient ratios. These
   overtime nurses incur higher expense, and are often less effective. We
   study the problem of permanent nurse staffing level estimation under
   demand uncertainty as a newsvendor model. Our models are based on
   limited moment information of the demand distribution. Additionally, we
   introduce the use of asymmetric cost functions representing overstaffing
   and understaffing nursing costs. Findings using data from the general
   surgery and intensive care units at hospitals in Chicago, IL and
   Augusta, GA are presented. Computational results based on publically
   available cost data show that 3.1\% and 7.3\% annual cost savings result
   by introducing salvage value and newsvendor optimization in intensive
   care and general care units respectively. This new staffing scheme also
   improves patient safety as shifts are staffed with more permanent
   nurses.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical study on the red-shift of laser-induced electro-absorption
   is presented. It is found that laser-induced red-shift scales with the
   cube root of the pump laser intensity in the optical tunneling regime
   and has an obvious deviation from this scale in the multi-photon regime.
   Our results show that in the optical tunneling regime, the laser-induced
   red shift has the same law as that in the direct current (DC)
   approximation. Though the scales are the same in the optical tunneling
   regime, the physical pictures in the two cases are quite different. The
   electro-absorption in the DC case is a tunneling-assisted transition
   process, while the laser-induced electro-absorption is a mixed
   multi-photon process.}},

Abstract = {{In comparison to traditional in vitro cell culture in Petri dishes or
   well plates, cell culture in microfluidic-based devices enables better
   control over chemical and physical environments, higher levels of
   experimental automation, and a reduction in experimental materials. Over
   the past decade, the advantages associated with cell culturing in
   microfluidic-based platforms have garnered significant interest and have
   led to a plethora of studies for high throughput cell assays,
   organs-on-a-chip applications, temporal signaling studies, and cell
   sorting. A clear concern for performing cell culture in
   microfluidic-based devices is deciding on a technique to deliver and
   pump media to cells that are encased in a microfluidic device. In this
   review, we summarize recent advances in pumping techniques for
   microfluidic cell culture and discuss their advantages and possible
   drawbacks. The ultimate goal of our review is to distill the large body
   of information available related to pumps for microfluidic cell culture
   in an effort to assist current and potential users of microfluidic-based
   devices for advanced in vitro cellular studies.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Ph(12)SQ (C6H5SiO1.5)(12) was blended into a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   based HTV silicone rubber as a reinforcing filler at loadings of (0,
   2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20\% by weight). The thermal stabilities and mechanical
   properties of these HTV silicone rubber composites were studied by
   thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and tensile testing, respectively.
   Dispersions of Ph(12)SQ were characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). The obtained results show the presence of SQ-rich
   regions that affect the thermal stabilities and mechanical properties of
   HTV silicone rubber. TGA shows that T-d1\% is delayed from approximately
   215 degrees C for DD0 to 350 degrees C (DD20) (about 130 degrees C) and
   the T-d5\% mass loss exhibits a similar trend. The thermo-oxidative
   stability also increases with Ph(12)SQ weight fraction. Also, the
   tensile strength and elongation at break of these HTV silicone rubbers
   increase from 8.8 to 11 MPa and 655 to 950 \% with incremental loading
   of Ph(12)SQ to 5 wt\% (DD5). Moreover, the addition of Ph(12)SQ
   increases its relative permittivity from 3.2 to 14.2 and the dissipation
   factor at 1 MHz increases from 0.01 to 0.05. Finally, the values of
   Td5\% at different heating rates were applied for comparison of the
   lifetime of DD0 and DD5 samples according to the D\&R model. The results
   show that DD5 offers a longer lifetime than DD0 at different
   temperatures.}},

Title = {{The Development and Implementation of a One-Dimensional S-n Method in

Journal = {{NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{176}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{During the last several years, a class of algorithms has been developed
   based on two-dimensional-one-dimensional (2D-1D) decomposition of the
   reactor transport problem. The current 2D-1D algorithm implemented in
   the DeCART (Deterministic Core Analysis based on Ray Tracing) code
   solves a set of coupled 2D planar transport and 1D axial diffusion
   equations. This method has been successfully applied to several light
   water reactor analysis problems. However, applications with strong axial
   heterogeneities have exposed the limitations of the current diffusion
   solvers used for the axial solution. The work reported in this paper is
   the implementation of a discrete ordinates (S-n)-based axial solver in
   DeCART. An S-n solver is chosen to preserve the consistency of the
   angular discretization between the radial method of characteristics and
   axial solvers. This paper presents the derivation of the nodal expansion
   method (NEM)-S S-n equations and its implementation in DeCART. The
   subplane spatial refinement method is introduced to reduce the
   computational cost and improve the accuracy of the calculations. The
   NEM-S-n axial solver is tested using the C5G7 benchmark. The DeCART
   results with the axial diffusion solver shows k(eff) errors of
   approximately -95, -74, and -110 pcm for the unrodded configuration,
   rodded configuration A, and rodded configuration B, respectively. These
   errors decrease to approximately -40, -11, and -12 pcm by using the
   NEM-S-n solver. In terms of pin power distribution, the use of the
   NEM-S-n solver has a small effect, except for the heavily rodded
   configuration. The implementation of the subplane scheme makes it
   possible to maintain a coarse axial mesh and therefore to reduce the
   computational cost of the three-dimensional calculations without
   reducing the accuracy of the solution.}},

Title = {{Interaction of multiple atmospheric-pressure micro-plasma jets in small
   arrays: He/O-2 into humid air}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Arrays of atmospheric-pressure plasma jets are being considered as a
   means to increase the area being treated in surface modification and in
   plasma medicine in particular. A unique challenge of scaling plasma jet
   arrays is that individual plasma jets in an array tend to interact with
   each other, which can lead to quenching of some individual jets. To
   investigate these potential interactions, a computational study of one-,
   two- and three-tube arrays of micro-plasma jet arrays was performed. An
   atmospheric-pressure He/O-2 = 99.8/0.2 mixture was flowed through the
   tubes into humid room air. We found that the jets interact through
   electrostatic, hydrodynamic and photolytic means. The hydrodynamic
   interactions result from the merging of individual He channels emerging
   from individual tubes as air diffuses into the extended gas jets.
   Ionization waves (IWs) or plasma bullets, which form the jets on the
   boundaries of an array, encounter higher mole fractions of air earlier
   compared with the center jet and so are slower or are quenched earlier.
   The close proximity of the jets produces electrostatic repulsion, which
   affects the trajectories of the IWs. If the jets are close enough,
   photoionizing radiation from their neighbors is an additional form of
   interaction. These interactions are sensitive to the spacing of the
   jets.}},

Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The flux-energy distribution functions of H-3(+) ions at the electrodes
   of capacitively coupled parallel plate discharges operated in a regime
   of relatively high gas pressures (200-650 Pa) are investigated
   experimentally using (differentially pumped) energy-resolved mass
   spectrometry under various conditions and compared with the results of a
   numeric simulation and a model. It is shown that the simulated
   distribution function can be reproduced by a simple analytical modeling
   approach, which assumes a constant collision frequency and is valid for
   highly collisional sheaths. The comparison between experiment and
   simulation reveals that not the entire angular distribution is covered
   by the diagnostics. However, the normalized experimentally obtained
   distributions are close to the simulated ones, thus indicating that the
   measurements allow for a reasonable discussion. In a single frequency
   13.56MHz discharge, the width of the distribution increases as a
   function of the voltage amplitude and decreases as a function of
   pressure. Applying an electrically asymmetric voltage waveform (13.56MHz
   + 27.12 MHz) to the powered electrode breaks the symmetry of the
   geometrically symmetric discharge. This allows manipulation of the shape
   and width of the ion flux-energy distribution functions at the
   electrodes by tuning the phase angle between the two frequencies. It is
   found experimentally that controlling the ion energy without affecting
   the total flux is possible via the electrical asymmetry effect under
   these high-pressure conditions, whereas a change in pressure or voltage
   amplitude affects both the energy and the flux of ions.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of plasma in underwater gas bubbles offers the potential
   to produce large volume plasma in water while minimizing electrode
   erosion. Such attributes are desirable for the design of plasma-based
   water purification systems. In this work, gas bubbles of diameter
   0.4-0.7mm were trapped in the node of a 26.4 kHz underwater acoustic
   standing wave and pulsed with voltages in the range 10-14 kV. Plasma
   formation in trapped, isolated bubbles was observed to occur through two
   separate pathways: (1) plasma generated in the bubble through impact by
   a liquid streamer and (2) plasma generated in the bubble due solely to
   the applied electric field. The former case demonstrates the mechanism
   of so-called streamer hopping in which the discharge transitions from a
   water streamer to a gaseous surface streamer. Perturbations of the
   bubble's fluid boundary due to the streamer are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Destabilized asphaltenes can easily adhere to the oil well production
   equipment, the transportation pipelines, and also the refining and
   storage facilities, resulting in significant remediation costs.
   Therefore, it is of great importance to the energy industry to
   understand the factors that govern the kinetics of asphaltene
   aggregation and precipitation. In this study, the effect of asphaltene
   concentration on their aggregation and precipitation tendencies after
   their destabilization with heptane is investigated for three different
   types of asphaltenes. It is intuitively expected that any increase in
   asphaltene concentration will accelerate the precipitation kinetics
   after heptane addition. For asphaltene concentrations below 1 wt \% in
   toluene, this expected trend is indeed experimentally confirmed.
   However, for asphaltene concentrations above 1 wt \%, an increase in
   concentration leads to slower aggregation instead. We believe that this
   counterintuitive decline in the aggregation rate is due to the
   stabilizing effect of stable or soluble asphaltenes. This effect has
   been overlooked in the existing aggregation models, and our research
   provides a better understanding of the factors controlling aggregation
   process. Accounting for the solubilizing effect of stable asphaltenes
   can provide successful predictions for the aggregation rate of
   asphaltenes at different asphaltene concentrations using Smoluchowski's
   model.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{83-88}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Creep behavior is among the critical properties of soil-geomembrane
   interfaces. However, there have been very limited studies in this area.
   In this study, one smooth and one textured high density polyethylene
   geomembrane were tested for their frictional characteristics with
   slightly dense Nevada sand. Normal pressures employed in the tests were
   25, 50 and 75 kPa. The sustained loadings lasted 240 min, and under each
   constant normal stress, creep occurred at three levels of shear stress
   at room temperature. Two loading speeds, 1 and 5 mm/min, were employed
   in the direct shear tests before and after creep. The study found that
   the post-creep frictional resistance appeared to be approximately the
   same as that obtained from a direct shear test without creep. The shear
   creep behaviour of sand-geomembrane interfaces followed the typical
   pattern of material creep, and under relatively small normal pressures
   that did not result in considerable damage of geomembrane surfaces,
   textured geomembrane interface with sand might exhibit larger shear
   creep displacement than smooth ones.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Supervisory Control Strategies for Series Plug-In Hybrid

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares the optimal fuel and electricity costs associated
   with two supervisory control strategies for a series plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicle (PHEV) using dynamic programming. One strategy has no
   restrictions on engine fuel usage and the second is restricted to fuel
   usage only after the battery is depleted below a certain threshold. Both
   strategies are optimized using deterministic dynamic programming (DDP)
   to ensure a fair comparison. The DDP algorithm is implemented using a
   backward-looking powertrain model. Such an approach resolves the
   computational issues arising because of: 1) the interpolations required
   to obtain value function estimates and 2) the characterization of
   constraints through penalty functions. The primary conclusion is that
   there is no significant difference in the optimal performance of the two
   control strategies for the series PHEV except when gasoline is
   unreasonably cheap (< \$1/gal). This result contrasts sharply with
   previous controller performance results for parallel and power-split
   PHEVs where the two strategies' performance is shown to differ for any
   gasoline price and driving distance. The reason for the contrast is the
   flexibility of engine operation in a series PHEV. The results are
   examined for different relative fuel and electricity prices and trip
   lengths.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the modeling, control system design, and
   experimental results for a prototype lighter-than-air wind energy system
   being pioneered by Altaeros Energies. This unique design features a
   horizontal-axis turbine that is elevated to high altitudes through a
   buoyant shroud, which is tethered to a ground-based platform. The
   system's altitude can be adjusted to maximize power production, and
   because the system is both functional and economical in a stationary
   position, it circumvents many of the controls challenges faced by
   kite-based wind energy systems. However, the need for generation of
   energy introduces pointing, efficiency, and autonomy requirements, which
   are not faced by conventional aerostats, thereby requiring a careful
   model-based control design. In this paper, we provide a dynamic model of
   the Altaeros system, then show how this model is leveraged in the plant
   design and in the design of the control system, which provides full
   autonomy, from takeoff, through power production, to autonomous landing.
   We provide simulation and experimental results that demonstrate the
   performance of the prototype and point to important areas where Altaeros
   will focus its efforts moving forward.}},

Pages = {{652-663}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and experimental implementation of
   an energy management controller for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)
   based on the application of game theory (GT). This controller is
   constructed as a feedback Stackelberg equilibrium in the noncooperative
   game between the driver and the powertrain with the cost penalizing fuel
   consumption, NOx emissions, battery state of charge deviation, and
   vehicle operating conditions deviation. This control policy is
   drive-cycle and time independent. A description of the controller
   implementation with ancillary strategy elements is given. Experimental
   results from tests in a parallel HEV prototype vehicle are presented and
   compared with the existing baseline controller in terms of fuel
   consumption and NOx emissions. The HEV powertrain configuration is
   advanced and includes a high-speed diesel engine, two electric motors,
   and automated converterless transmission. Over the New European Driving
   Cycle (NEDC), the GT controller, with minimal calibration effort,
   demonstrates better performance than the existing baseline controller
   that is calibrated from the deterministic dynamic programing solution
   over NEDC. We also demonstrate that the GT controller substantially
   outperforms the baseline controller over other real-world-focused
   driving cycles while providing good drivability.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we study a stochastic production/inventory system with
   finite production capacity and random demand. The cumulative production
   and demand are modeled by a two-dimensional Brownian motion process.
   There is a setup cost for switching on the production and a convex
   holding and shortage cost, and our objective is to find the optimal
   production/inventory control that minimizes the average cost. Both
   lost-sales and backlog cases are studied. For the lost-sales model we
   show that, within a large class of policies, the optimal production
   strategy is either to produce according to an (s, S) policy, or never
   turn on the machine at all (thus it is optimal for the firm to not enter
   the business); whereas for the backlog model, we prove that the optimal
   production policy is always of the (s, S) type. Our approach first
   develops a lower bound for the average cost among a large class of
   nonanticipating policies and then shows that the value function of the
   desired policy reaches the lower bound. The results offer insights on
   the structure of the optimal control policies as well as the interplays
   between system parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate identification of significant aberrations in cancers (AISAIC)
   is a systematic effort to discover potential cancer-driving genes such
   as oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Two major confounding factors

   background aberrations in tumor samples. We describe a Java AISAIC
   package that provides comprehensive analytic functions and graphic user
   interface for integrating two statistically principled in silico
   approaches to address the aforementioned challenges in DNA copy number
   analyses. In addition, the package provides a command-line interface for
   users with scripting and programming needs to incorporate or extend
   AISAIC to their customized analysis pipelines. This open-source
   multiplatform software offers several attractive features: (i) it
   implements a user friendly complete pipeline from processing raw data to
   reporting analytic results; (ii) it detects deletion types directly from
   copy number signals using a Bayes hypothesis test; (iii) it estimates
   the fraction of normal contamination for each sample; (iv) it produces
   unbiased null distribution of random background alterations by iterative
   aberration-exclusive permutations; and (v) it identifies significant
   consensus regions and the percentage of homozygous/hemizygous deletions

Abstract = {{The analytical calculation of the bit error rate (BER) of digital
   optical receivers that employ avalanche photodiodes (APDs) is
   challenging due to 1) the stochastic nature of the avalanche
   photodiode's impulse-response function and 2) the presence of
   intersymbol interference (ISI). At ultrafast transmission rates, ISI
   becomes a dominant component of the BER, and its effect on the BER
   should be carefully addressed. One solution to this problem, termed the
   bit-pattern-dependent (PD) approach, is to first calculate the
   conditional BER given a specific bit pattern and then average over all
   possible bit patterns. Alternatively, a simplifying method, termed the
   bit-pattern-independent (PI) approach, has been commonly used whereby
   the average bit stream is used to calculate the distribution of the
   receiver output, which, in turn, is used to calculate the BER. However,
   when ISI is dominant, the PI approximation is inaccurate. Here, the two
   approaches are analytically compared by analyzing their asymptotic
   behavior and their bounds. Conditions are found to determine when the PI
   method overestimates the BER. The BER found using the PD method
   exponentially decays with the received optical power, whereas for the PI
   approach, the BER converges to a constant, which is unrealistic. For an
   InP-based APD receiver with a 100-nm multiplication layer, the PI method
   is found to be inaccurate for transmission rates beyond 20 Gb/s.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents compact and low profile two-port antennas that can
   provide polarization or pattern diversity schemes from a common
   aperture. The proposed antennas make use of a novel small microstrip
   antenna topology with an open area at its waist. The two sections of the
   small-size microstrip antenna are connected through a magnetic coupling
   mechanism facilitated by two vertical metallic strips connecting the top
   plates to the ground plane. This allows for placement of another small
   antenna element within the same aperture having either polarization or
   pattern that is orthogonal to the microstrip antenna with low envelope
   correlation. Topologies of polarization and pattern-diversity antennas
   are optimized for size reduction and minimum envelope correlation.
   Although the proposed diversity antenna consists of two antenna elements
   with different polarizations or radiation patterns, they just occupy
   about 30\% of the area of a conventional microstrip antenna over the
   same substrate. It is shown that the envelope correlation between
   radiation patterns of the two antenna elements is lower than -30 dB over
   the 10-dB return loss bandwidth of the proposed antenna.}},

Abstract = {{A thin, wideband, nonabsorptive radar cross section (RCS) reducer (NARR)
   layer capable of operation over a wide range of incident angles and for
   any arbitrary incident wave polarization is presented. The design is
   based on implementation of two different types of subwavelength
   miniaturized-element frequency selective surfaces (MEFSS) backed by a
   thin grounded dielectric substrate. Two MEFSS structures are designed in
   such a way to produce reflection phase values with a difference of about
   180 degrees (+/- 30 degrees) over a wide frequency range. Segments of
   these surfaces are arranged in periodic and aperiodic fashions to
   distribute the scattered energy and minimize the maximum bistatic RCS of
   the underlying metallic surface over a wide range of incident angles at
   both polarizations. It is shown that the aperiodic NARR structure has
   3-dB lower maximum bistatic RCS compared to the periodic one. The -6 dB
   bistatic RCS reduction bandwidth of 66\% is achieved for both periodic
   and aperiodic NARR surfaces at the normal incidence. The monostatic RCS
   reduction level at normal incidence is the same for both structures, but
   the aperiodic NARR layer is shown to provide 13\% higher -10 dB
   bandwidth. In addition, the performance of both structures for oblique
   angle of incidence up to 50 degrees is examined and is shown that the
   aperiodic NARR layer shows better performance in suppressing the RCS
   sidelobes. As a partial experimental validation, two prototypes of
   periodic and aperiodic NARR layers are fabricated and their monostatic
   RCS reduction are characterized experimentally. The measured results are
   in good agreement with the corresponding simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This communication presents a low profile and electrically small
   wideband antenna with omnidirectional radiation pattern and vertical
   polarization. A novel design approach manipulating the topology of a low
   profile folded monopole antenna with capacitively coupled parasitic
   elements in the same plane is presented to achieve omnidirectional
   radiation pattern. The 10-dB return loss fractional bandwidth of 43\% is
   achieved with the dimension of 0.2 lambda(LF) X 0.2 lambda(LF) X 0.06
   lambda(LF) where lambda(LF) is the wavelength at the lowest frequency of
   the operation. Unlike the convention wideband lambda /4 monopole
   antennas utilizing inductively coupled parasitic elements, the lambda
   /2folded monopole antenna allows for positioning the capacitively
   coupled parasitic elements in the middle of the antenna where maximum
   electric stored energy is formed. This, together with reducing the
   lateral dimension of the folded monopole antenna, enables the
   cancellation of radiated fields from electric currents in the horizontal
   plane of the proposed antenna, which is essential to achieve vertically
   polarized omnidirectional radiation. The compact parasitic elements
   introduce additional resonances that significantly increase the antenna
   bandwidth. Effects of design parameters on two resonant frequencies and
   impedance matching to a 50 Omega feed are investigated using the
   equivalent circuit model of the parasitic element and full-wave
   electromagnetic (EM) simulations. Based on this analysis, a design
   procedure to optimize the antenna topology is established.}},

Abstract = {{SPIRiT (iterative self-consistent parallel imaging reconstruction), and

   Our new method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers
   converges much faster than existing methods because of the

Abstract = {{Histotripsy produces tissue fractionation through dense energetic bubble
   clouds generated by short, high-pressure, ultrasound pulses.
   Conventional histotripsy treatments have used longer pulses from 3 to 10
   cycles, wherein the lesion-producing bubble cloud generation depends on
   the pressure-release scattering of very high peak positive shock fronts
   from previously initiated, sparsely distributed bubbles (the
   shock-scattering mechanism). In our recent work, the peak negative
   pressure (P-) for generation of dense bubble clouds directly by a single
   negative half cycle, the intrinsic threshold, was measured. In this
   paper, the dense bubble clouds and resulting lesions (in red blood cell
   phantoms and canine tissues) generated by these supra-intrinsic
   threshold pulses were studied. A 32-element, PZT-8, 500-kHz therapy
   transducer was used to generate very short (<2 cycles) histotripsy
   pulses at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 1 Hz and P- from 24.5 to
   80.7 MPa. The results showed that the spatial extent of the
   histotripsy-induced lesions increased as the applied P- increased, and
   the sizes of these lesions corresponded well to the estimates of the
   focal regions above the intrinsic cavitation threshold, at least in the
   lower pressure regime (P- =26 to 35 MPa). The average sizes for the
   smallest reproducible lesions were approximately 0.9 x 1.7 mm (lateral x
   axial), significantly smaller than the -6-dB beamwidth of the transducer
   (1.8 x 4.0 mm). These results suggest that, using the intrinsic
   threshold mechanism, well-confined and microscopic lesions can be
   precisely generated and their spatial extent can be estimated based on
   the fraction of the focal region exceeding the intrinsic cavitation
   threshold. Because the supra-threshold portion of the negative half
   cycle can be precisely controlled, lesions considerably less than a
   wavelength are easily produced, hence the term microtripsy.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy produces tissue fractionation through dense energetic bubble
   clouds generated by short, high-pressure, ultrasound pulses. When using
   pulses shorter than 2 cycles, the generation of these energetic bubble
   clouds only depends on where the peak negative pressure (P-) exceeds the
   intrinsic threshold of the medium (26 to 30 MPa in soft tissue with high
   water content). This paper investigates a strategic method for precise
   lesion generation in which a low-frequency pump pulse is applied to
   enable a sub-threshold high-frequency probe pulse to exceed the
   intrinsic threshold. This pump-probe method of controlling a
   supra-threshold volume can be called dual-beam histotripsy.
   A 20-element dual-frequency (500-kHz and 3-MHz elements confocally
   aligned) array transducer was used to generate dual-beam histotripsy
   pulses in red blood cell phantoms and porcine hepatic tissue specimens.
   The results showed that when subintrinsic-threshold pump (500-kHz) and
   probe (3-MHz) pulses were applied together, dense bubble clouds (and
   resulting lesions) were only generated when their peak negative
   pressures combined constructively to exceed the intrinsic threshold. The
   smallest reproducible lesion varied with the relative amplitude between
   the pump and probe pulses, and, with a higher proportion of the probe
   pulse, smaller lesions could be generated. When the propagation
   direction of the probe pulse relative to the pump pulse was altered, the
   shape of the produced lesion changed based on the region that exceeded
   intrinsic threshold. Because the low-frequency pump pulse is more immune
   to attenuation and aberrations, and the high-frequency probe pulse can
   provide precision in lesion formation, this dual-beam histotripsy
   approach would be very useful in situations in which precise lesion
   formation is required through a highly attenuative and aberrative
   medium, such as transcranial therapy. This is particularly true if a
   small low-attenuation acoustic window is available for the
   high-frequency probe transducer.}},

Title = {{Histotripsy-Induced Cavitation Cloud Initiation Thresholds in Tissues of

Abstract = {{Histotripsy is an ultrasound ablation method that depends on the
   initiation and maintenance of a cavitation bubble cloud to fractionate
   soft tissue. This paper studies how tissue properties impact the
   pressure threshold to initiate the cavitation bubble cloud. Our previous
   study showed that shock scattering off one or more initial bubbles,
   expanded to sufficient size in the focus, plays an important role in
   initiating a dense cavitation cloud. In this process, the shock
   scattering causes the positive pressure phase to be inverted, resulting
   in a scattered wave that has the opposite polarity of the incident
   shock. The inverted shock is superimposed on the incident negative
   pressure phase to form extremely high negative pressures, resulting in a
   dense cavitation cloud growing toward the transducer. We hypothesize
   that increased tissue stiffness impedes the expansion of initial
   bubbles, reducing the scattered tensile pressure, and thus requiring
   higher initial intensities for cloud initiation. To test this
   hypothesis, 5-cycle histotripsy pulses at pulse repetition frequencies
   (PRFs) of 10, 100, or 1000 Hz were applied by a 1-MHz transducer focused
   inside mechanically tunable tissue-mimicking agarose phantoms and
   various ex vivo porcine tissues covering a range of Young's moduli. The
   threshold to initiate a cavitation cloud and resulting bubble expansion
   were recorded using acoustic backscatter detection and optical imaging.
   In both phantoms and ex vivo tissue, results demonstrated a higher
   cavitation cloud initiation threshold for tissues of higher Young's
   modulus. Results also demonstrated a decrease in bubble expansion in
   phantoms of higher Young's modulus. These results support our
   hypothesis, improve our understanding of the effect of histotripsy in
   tissues with different mechanical properties, and provide a rational
   basis to tailor acoustic parameters for fractionation of specific
   tissues.}},

Abstract = {{A method was developed using 3D stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   and was piloted to test hypotheses concerning changes in apical ligament
   lengths and lines of action from rest to maximal Valsalva.
   Ten women with (cases) and ten without (controls) pelvic organ prolapse
   (POP) were selected from an ongoing case-control study. Supine,
   multiplanar stress MRI was performed at rest and at maximal Valsalva and
   was imported into 3D Slicer v. 3.4.1 and aligned. The 3D reconstructions
   of the uterus and vagina, cardinal ligament (CL), deep uterosacral
   ligament (USLd), and pelvic bones were created. Ligament length and
   orientation were then measured.
   Adequate ligament representations were possible in all 20 study
   participants. When cases were compared with controls, the curve length
   of the CL at rest was 71 +/- 16 mm vs. 59 +/- 9 mm (p = 0.051), and the
   USLd was 38 +/- 16 mm vs. 36 +/- 11 mm (p = 0.797). Similarly, the
   increase in CL length from rest to strain was 30 +/- 16 mm vs. 15 +/- 9
   mm (p = 0.033), and USLd was 15 +/- 12 mm vs. 7 +/- 4 mm (p = 0.094).
   Likewise, the change in USLd angle was significantly different from CL
   (p < 0.001).
   This technique allows quantification of 3D geometry at rest and at
   strain. In our pilot sample, at maximal Valsalva, CL elongation was
   greater in cases than controls, whereas USLd was not; CL also exhibited
   greater changes in ligament length, and USLd exhibited greater changes
   in ligament inclination angle.}},

Abstract = {{Although humans clearly expend more energy to walk with an extra load,
   it is unclear what biomechanical mechanisms contribute to that increase.
   One possible contribution is the mechanical work performed on the body
   center of mass (COM), which simple models predict should increase
   linearly with added mass. The work should be performed primarily by the
   lower extremity joints, although in unknown distribution, and cost a
   proportionate amount of metabolic energy. We therefore tested normal
   adults (N=8) walking at constant speed (1.25 m s(-1)) with varying
   backpack loads up to 40\% of body weight. We measured mechanical work
   (both performed on the COM and joint work from inverse dynamics), as
   well as metabolic energy expenditure through respirometry. Both measures
   of work were found to increase approximately linearly with carried load,
   with COM work rate increasing by approximately 1.40 W for each 1 kg of
   additional load. The joints all contributed work, but the greatest
   increase in positive work was attributable to the ankle during push-off
   (45-60\% of stride time) and the knee in the rebound after collision
   (12-30\% stride). The hip performed increasing amounts of negative work,
   near the end of stance. Rate of metabolic energy expenditure also
   increased approximately linearly with load, by approximately 7.6 W for
   each 1 kg of additional load. The ratio of the increases in work and
   metabolic cost yielded a relatively constant efficiency of approximately
   16\%. The metabolic cost not explained by work appeared to be relatively
   constant with load and did not exhibit a particular trend. Most of the
   increasing cost for carrying a load appears to be explained by positive
   mechanical work, especially about the ankle and knee, with both work and
   metabolic cost increasing nearly linearly with added mass.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the characterization of thin-film near and short wavelength
   infrared absorbers comprised of carbon nanotubes dispersed in a polymer.
   Charged nanodiamond particles are used to effectively and uniformly
   disperse the carbon nanotubes in the polymer matrix, leading to a very
   homogenous film. Using this new technique, we demonstrate an infrared
   absorption of up to 95\% in films with thicknesses <2000 nm. This
   remarkably high absorption is the result of low reflection off the
   surface and high absorption across the film thickness. The complex
   refractive index of the films is extracted using an effective media
   approximation. Calculations show the film has a wide angle for high
   absorption and is polarization independent. These films are easy to
   fabricate, robust and damage-resistant, and are compatible with
   post-processing techniques. These films can be used as the coating layer
   to boost the efficiency of uncooled infrared sensors and solar-thermal
   energy harvesters.}},

Abstract = {{A level set based structural topology optimization method is proposed
   for the optimal design of coupled structural-acoustic system with a
   focus on interior noise reduction. The objective is to consider an
   optimum structure with an optimum interface between the structural and
   acoustic domains, for minimizing the acoustic response of the coupled
   system at specified points or surfaces inside the acoustic domain within
   a frequency range of interest, subject to the given amount of the
   material of the structure. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the
   structural boundary variations is carried out using material derivative
   and the adjoint method, while the standard finite element method is
   employed for solving the state equation and the adjoint equation. The
   optimal structure of the coupled structural-acoustic system with smooth
   boundary is obtained through the level set evolution, while the velocity
   field is derived from the sensitivity analysis and the optimization
   algorithm. A number of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate
   the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach for the noise
   reduction purpose. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Modeling cutter tilt and cutter-spindle stiffness for machine condition

Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{5-8}},

Abstract = {{In face milling, the spindle is intentionally tilted to avoid
   backcutting. The cutter tilt during machining is a combined effect of
   the intentional initial tilt and cutter-spindle deflection, which varies
   with cutting load during machining. An accurate estimation of the cutter
   tilt is critical to surface quality control and machine health
   monitoring. However, due to the small magnitude, the spindle tilt and
   deflection are difficult to measure in real time. Conventionally, the
   cutter tilt can be obtained through in-line sensors mounted on the
   machine tool but such in-line measurement is greatly influenced by the
   dynamic machining conditions such as vibration. This paper proposes a
   method to monitor the spindle setup tilt and deflection using surface
   data measured by high-definition metrology (HDM). Two parameters are
   proposed to characterize the cutter tilt, i.e., cutter tilt at idle
   state (initial cutter tilt) for spindle setup and cutter-spindle
   stiffness for the cutter-spindle deflection. Cutting force modeling is
   conducted to estimate these two parameters in conjunction with
   statistical procedures that fit the model to HDM surface data. The
   estimated cutter-spindle stiffness variation is also correlated to
   machine conditions such as a loose or worn bearing for process
   diagnosis. The method is demonstrated via experimental data from a
   machining process for automotive engine heads.}},

Abstract = {{This exploratory study examines the impact of a collaborative inquiry-
   and design-based afterschool program on urban high school students'
   IT/STEM learning-using information technology (IT) within the context of
   science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The study used
   a mixed methods design, involving 77 participants within two cohort
   groups, each participating in an eighteen-month intervention period.
   Data were collected from the pre- and post-surveys, analysis of the
   participants' IT/STEM projects, external evaluation reports, and
   follow-up interviews. Findings indicate that the program had a
   significant impact on students' technology and IT/STEM skills, frequency
   of technology use, and understanding of IT use in STEM-oriented fields.
   Some degree of impact on attitude changes toward IT/STEM and career
   aspirations in these fields was also in evidence. The study demonstrates
   that IT/STEM experiences supported through technology-enhanced, inquiry-
   and design-based collaborative learning strategies have significant
   impact on urban high school students' IT/STEM learning. Effect of
   afterschool programs on attitude changes and IT/STEM-related career
   aspirations of urban high school students are recommended areas of
   further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Hot-pressed laminates with a {[}0/90](48) lay-up, consisting of 83\% by
   volume of ultra high molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibres, and
   17\% by volume of polyurethane (PU) matrix, were cut into cantilever
   beams and subjected to transverse end-loading. The collapse mechanisms
   were observed both visually and by X-ray scans. Short beams deform
   elastically and collapse plastically in longitudinal shear, with a shear
   strength comparable to that observed in double notch, interlaminar shear
   tests. In contrast, long cantilever beams deform in bending and collapse
   via a plastic hinge at the built-in end of the beam. The plastic hinge
   is formed by two wedge-shaped microbuckle zones that grow in size and in
   intensity with increasing hinge rotation. This new mode of microbuckling
   under macroscopic bending involves both elastic bending and shearing of
   the plies, and plastic shear of the interface between each ply. The
   double-wedge pattern contrasts with the more usual parallel-sided
   plastic microbuckle that occurs in uniaxial compression. Finite element
   simulations and analytical models give additional insight into the
   dominant material and geometric parameters that dictate the, collapse
   response of the UHMWPE composite beam in bending. Detailed comparisons
   between the observed and predicted collapse responses are used in order
   to construct a constitutive model for laminated UHMWPE composites. (C)

Title = {{Tension, compression, and bending of superelastic shape memory alloy
   tubes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{506-537}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{While many uniaxial tension experiments of shape memory alloys (SMAs)
   have been published in the literature, relatively few experimental
   studies address their behavior in compression or bending, despite the
   prevalence of this latter deformation mode in applications. In this
   study, superelastic NiTi tubes from a single lot of material were
   characterized in tension, compression, and pure bending, which allowed
   us to make direct comparisons between the deformation modes for the
   first time. Custom built fixtures were used to overcome some
   long-standing experimental difficulties with performing well-controlled
   loading and accurate measurements during uniaxial compression (avoiding
   buckling) and large-rotation bending. In all experiments, the
   isothermal, global, mechanical responses were measured, and stereo
   digital image correlation (DIC) was used to measure the evolution of the
   strain fields on the tube's outer surface.
   As is characteristic of textured NiTi, our tubes exhibited significant
   tension-compression asymmetry in their uniaxial responses.
   Stress-induced transformations in tension exhibited flat force plateaus
   accompanied by strain localization and propagation. No such
   localization, however, was observed in compression, and the stress
   ``plateaus{''} during compression always maintained a positive tangent
   modulus. While our uniaxial results are similar to the observations of
   previous researchers, the DIC strain measurements provided details of
   localized strain behavior with more clarity and allowed more
   quantitative measurements to be made. Consistent with the
   tension-compression asymmetry, our bending experiments showed a
   significant shift of the neutral axis towards the compression side.
   Furthermore, the tube exhibited strain localization on the tension side,
   but no localization on the compression side during bending. This is a
   new observation that has not been explored before. Detailed analysis of
   the strain distribution across the tube diameter revealed that the
   traditional assumption of elementary beam theory, that plane sections
   remain plane, does not hold. Yet when the strain was averaged over a few
   diameters of axial length, the tensile and compressive responses input
   into elementary beam theory predicted the global bending response with
   reasonable accuracy. While it is encouraging that a simple model could
   predict the moment-curvature response, we recommend that beam theory be
   used with caution. The averaged strain field can under/over predict
   local strains by as much as two-fold due to the localized deformation
   morphology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Direct epitaxial growth of single-crystalline germanium (Ge) nanowires
   at room temperature has been performed through an electrodeposition
   process on conductive wafers immersed in an aqueous bath. The crystal

   process involving the electroreduction of dissolved GeO2(aq) in water at
   isolated liquid gallium (Ga) nanodroplet electrodes resting on
   single-crystalline Ge or Si supports. Ge nanowires were electrodeposited
   on the wafer scale (>10 cm(2)) using only common glassware and a digital
   potentiostat. High-resolution electron micrographs and electron
   diffraction patterns collected from cross sections of individual
   substrate-nanowire contacts in addition to scanning electron micrographs
   of the orientation of nanowires across entire films on substrates with
   different crystalline orientations, supported the notion of epitaxial
   nanowire growth. Energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental mapping of
   single nanowires indicated the Ga(l) nanodroplet remains affixed to the
   tip of the growing nanowire throughout the nanowire electrodeposition
   process. Current voltage responses measured across many individual
   nanowires yielded reproducible resistance values. The presented data
   cumulatively show epitaxial growth of covalent group IV nanowires is
   possible from the reduction of a dissolved oxide under purely benchtop

Abstract = {{Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may be employed to search for a
   probability distribution over a bounded space of function arguments to
   estimate which argument(s) optimize(s) an objective function. This
   search-based optimization requires sampling the suitability, or fitness,
   of arguments in the search space. When the objective function or the
   fitness of arguments vary with time, significant exploration of the
   search space is required. Search efficiency then becomes a more relevant
   measure of the usefulness of an MCMC method than traditional measures
   such as convergence speed to the stationary distribution and asymptotic
   variance of stationary distribution estimates. Search efficiency refers
   to how quickly prior information about the search space is traded-off
   for search effort savings. Optimal search efficiency occurs when the
   entropy of the probability distribution over the space during search is
   maximized. Whereas the Metropolis case of the Hastings MCMC algorithm
   with fixed candidate generation is optimal with respect to asymptotic
   variance of stationary distribution estimates, this paper proves that
   Barker's case is optimal with respect to search efficiency if the
   fitness of the arguments in the search space is characterized by an
   exponential function. The latter instance of optimality is beneficial
   for time-varying optimization that is also model-independent.}},

Abstract = {{A unified method for solving the strip yield model for collinear cracks
   in finite and infinite sheet is proposed. The method is based on the
   weight function of a single crack. Two collinear cracks in finite and
   infinite sheets are used to apply and verify this method. The plastic
   zone size, crack opening displacement and stress distribution along the
   ligament between cracks obtained by using the present method are
   extensively compared with existing available results and finite element
   solutions, and very good agreements are observed. Combined with the
   Crack Tip Opening Angle (CTOA) criterion, the unified method is used to
   predict the crack growth behavior and residual strength for 2024-T3
   aluminum alloy sheet with Multiple Site Damage (MSD). Thirty-two sheets
   with four types of MSD are designed and tested to verify this method. It
   is shown that the present method is able to predict various crack growth
   behaviors observed in experiment. The predicted residual strengths are
   within 9\% of the corresponding test results. Compared to the
   elastic-plastic finite element method, the present method is much more

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes an efficient method for scheduling an
   energy-consuming sensor sparingly in combination with an ON-OFF
   controller, specifically for a finite horizon control problem in which
   only end states are critical. In certain low-power applications, such as
   autonomous microrobotics, ON-OFF controllers can be very efficient in
   operating piezoelectric actuators (and other capacitive actuation
   schemes) compared to traditional analog and pulsewidth modulation
   controllers. However, with existing sensing circuitry, sensing at the
   same frequency as control can be prohibitively expensive, because energy
   consumption in the sensing circuitry may be comparable or even much
   higher than energy consumption for actuation. Instead, a method is
   presented for best scheduling a limited number of sensor measurements
   and updates to control inputs during a finite horizon ON-OFF control
   problem, in response to Gaussian disturbances and measurement noise. To
   simplify the problem, a lower bound for the expected value of a
   quadratic error function of the end states is found, which permits rapid
   evaluation of candidate sensor times. When actuator energy consumption
   is incorporated in the optimization, this produces a numerically
   efficient near-optimal strategy for determining best measurement times
   and updates to the control input sequence.}},

Abstract = {{Moving magnet actuators (MMAs) are direct-drive, single-phase
   electromagnetic linear actuators that provide friction-less and
   backlash-free motion over a range of several millimeters. This paper
   investigates the feasibility of using MMAs to simultaneously achieve
   large range, high speed, and high motion quality in flexure-based
   nanopositioning systems. Component and system level design challenges
   and associated tradeoffs in meeting the aforementioned nanopositioning
   performance are discussed and derived. In particular, it is shown that
   even as the overall size of a traditional MMA is varied, the actuation
   force remains directly proportional to the square root of the actuator's
   moving magnet mass and the square root of power consumed. This
   proportionality constant, identified as the dynamic actuator constant,
   serves as a figure of merit for MMAs. When an MMA is employed in a
   flexure-based nanopositioning system, this constant directly impacts the
   system-level positioning performance in terms of range, resolution,
   speed, and temperature rise. This quantitative determination highlights
   the significance of incorporating a thermal management system for heat
   dissipation, minimizing noise and harmonic distortion in the current
   driver, and improving the force-stroke uniformity of the actuator. Based
   on this understanding, a single-axis nanopositioning system, which
   simultaneously achieves 10 mm range, 4 nm resolution, open-loop natural
   frequency of 25 Hz, and temperature rise of less than 0.5. C, is
   designed, fabricated, and tested. Preliminary controller design and
   closed-loop operation highlight the potential and limitations of MMAs in
   large-range, high-speed nanopositioning.}},

Abstract = {{A modern digital system includes in a single chip many components:
   processing cores, large caches, memory controllers, and hardware
   accelerators. Looking forward, future semiconductor technologies will
   enable even higher device integration, overall increasing system
   performance while reducing energy consumption. Unfortunately, prominent
   experts agree that such technologies will be prone to both permanent and
   transient faults within their lifetime. With the goal of addressing this
   issue, we propose Cardio: a low-cost architecture for reliable chip
   multiprocessors. Our solution is based on a novel hardware/software
   co-design where silicon failures are detected in hardware and system
   reconfiguration is managed in software. Comparing Cardio with a
   state-of-the-art hardware-based resiliency solution, Immunet, we found
   that our design can achieve a comparable fault response time while
   requiring a much lower area overhead. The proposed solution relies on a
   distributed resource manager to collect information about a CMP
   component's health, and leverages a synchronized distributed control
   mechanism to recover from permanent failures. Such architecture can
   operate as long as at least one general-purpose processor is still
   functional. Our experimental evaluation indicates that the overall
   performance impact of Cardio is as low as 4.5\%, and its dynamic
   reconfiguration time upon fault detection is comprised between 20 and 50
   thousand cycles.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a continuum-based approach for multi-objective
   topology optimization of multicomponent structures. Objectives include
   minimization of compliance, weight, and cost of assembly and
   manufacturing. Design variables are partitioned into two main groups:
   those pertaining to material allocation within a design domain (base
   topology problem), and those pertaining to decomposition of a monolithic
   structure into multiple components (joint allocation problem). Generally
   speaking, the two problems are coupled in the sense that the
   decomposition of an optimal monolithic structure is not always
   guaranteed to produce an optimal multicomponent structure. However, for
   spot-welded sheet-metal structures (such as those often found in
   automotive applications), certain assumptions can be made about the
   performance of a monolithic structure that favor the adoption of a
   two-stage approach that decouples the base topology and joint allocation
   problems. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) is used throughout
   the studies in this paper. While the problem decoupling in two-stage
   approaches significantly reduces the size of the search space and allows
   better performance of the GA, the size of the search space can still be
   quite enormous in the second stage. To further improve the performance,
   a new mutation operator based on decomposition templates and localized
   joints morphing is proposed. A cantilever-loaded structure is used to
   study and compare various setups of single and two-stage GA approaches
   and establish the merit of the proposed GA operators. The approach is
   then applied to a simplified model of an automotive vehicle floor
   subject to global bending loading condition.}},

Abstract = {{AimAssess the ability of a panel of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)
   biomarkers as predictors of periodontal disease progression (PDP).
   Materials and methodsIn this study, 100 individuals participated in a
   12-month longitudinal investigation and were categorized into four
   groups according to their periodontal status. GCF, clinical parameters
   and saliva were collected bi-monthly. Subgingival plaque and serum were
   collected bi-annually. For 6months, no periodontal treatment was
   provided. At 6months, patients received periodontal therapy and
   continued participation from 6 to 12months. GCF samples were analysed by
   ELISA for MMP-8, MMP-9, Osteoprotegerin, C-reactive Protein and IL-1.
   Differences in median levels of GCF biomarkers were compared between
   stable and progressing participants using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test
   (p=0.05). Clustering algorithm was used to evaluate the ability of oral
   biomarkers to classify patients as either stable or progressing.
   ResultsEighty-three individuals completed the 6-month monitoring phase.
   With the exception of GCF C-reactive protein, all biomarkers were
   significantly higher in the PDP group compared to stable patients.
   Clustering analysis showed highest sensitivity levels when biofilm
   pathogens and GCF biomarkers were combined with clinical measures, 74\%
   (95\% CI=61, 86).
   ConclusionsSignature of GCF fluid-derived biomarkers combined with
   pathogens and clinical measures provides a sensitive measure for
   discrimination of PDP (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00277745).}},

Abstract = {{Cs2LiYCI6 (CLYC) is a new scintillator that is suitable for dual gamma
   neutron detectors due to its gamma spectroscopic capabilities while
   producing monoenergetic pulses from neutron captures with Li-6. We
   present new characterization results for a 2 x 2 cm(2) CLYC crystal. The
   detector resolution was characterized using weak check photon sources
   including Cs-137, and the detector's neutron capture capabilities were
   characterized with several measurements of Cf-252 with varying
   thicknesses of polyethylene moderator. It was found that the Li-6
   neutron capture rate was maximized when using approximately 7.6 cm of
   polyethylene moderator. A 5\% resolution for the 662-keV line of Cs-137
   and a 3.4\% resolution of the Li-6 neutron capture peak were measured
   with our experimental set-up.
   MCNPX-PoliMi was used to model the measurements performed with the CLYC
   detector, and MPPost was used to determine the light output
   distribution, convert Li-6 neutron captures into light, and apply energy
   resolution. It was found that the modeling technique was capable of
   predicting Cs-137 photon light output distributions for all light output
   greater than 200 keVee, and also to predict the same optimal
   polyethylene thickness as the measurement. Intrinsic neutron capture
   efficiency was estimated to be about 10\%, which is a factor-of-5
   improvement over an equivalent volume of He-3 at a pressure of 10 atm.

Title = {{Lipid Bilayer Vesicle Generation Using Microfluidic Jetting}},
Journal = {{Jove-Journal of Visualized Experiments}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Bottom-up synthetic biology presents a novel approach for investigating
   and reconstituting biochemical systems and, potentially, minimal
   organisms. This emerging field engages engineers, chemists, biologists,
   and physicists to design and assemble basic biological components into
   complex, functioning systems from the bottom up. Such bottom-up systems
   could lead to the development of artificial cells for fundamental
   biological inquiries and innovative therapies(1,2). Giant unilamellar
   vesicles (GUVs) can serve as a model platform for synthetic biology due
   to their cell-like membrane structure and size. Microfluidic jetting, or
   microjetting, is a technique that allows for the generation of GUVs with
   controlled size, membrane composition, transmembrane protein
   incorporation, and encapsulation(3). The basic principle of this method
   is the use of multiple, high-frequency fluid pulses generated by a
   piezo-actuated inkjet device to deform a suspended lipid bilayer into a
   GUV. The process is akin to blowing soap bubbles from a soap film. By
   varying the composition of the jetted solution, the composition of the
   encompassing solution, and/or the components included in the bilayer,
   researchers can apply this technique to create customized vesicles. This
   paper describes the procedure to generate simple vesicles from a droplet
   interface bilayer by microjetting.}},

Title = {{Using Microfluidics Chips for Live Imaging and Study of Injury Responses
   in Drosophila Larvae}},
Journal = {{Jove-Journal of Visualized Experiments}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{84}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Live imaging is an important technique for studying cell biological
   processes, however this can be challenging in live animals. The
   translucent cuticle of the Drosophila larva makes it an attractive model
   organism for live imaging studies. However, an important challenge for
   live imaging techniques is to noninvasively immobilize and position an
   animal on the microscope. This protocol presents a simple and easy to
   use method for immobilizing and imaging Drosophila larvae on a
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device, which we call the
   `larva chip'. The larva chip is comprised of a snug-fitting PDMS
   microchamber that is attached to a thin glass coverslip, which, upon
   application of a vacuum via a syringe, immobilizes the animal and brings
   ventral structures such as the nerve cord, segmental nerves, and body
   wall muscles, within close proximity to the coverslip. This allows for
   high-resolution imaging, and importantly, avoids the use of anesthetics
   and chemicals, which facilitates the study of a broad range of
   physiological processes. Since larvae recover easily from the
   immobilization, they can be readily subjected to multiple imaging
   sessions. This allows for longitudinal studies over time courses ranging
   from hours to days. This protocol describes step-by-step how to prepare
   the chip and how to utilize the chip for live imaging of neuronal events
   in 3rd instar larvae. These events include the rapid transport of
   organelles in axons, calcium responses to injury, and time-lapse studies
   of the trafficking of photo-convertible proteins over long distances and
   time scales. Another application of the chip is to study regenerative
   and degenerative responses to axonal injury, so the second part of this
   protocol describes a new and simple procedure for injuring axons within
   peripheral nerves by a segmental nerve crush.}},

Abstract = {{Stakeholders are concerned with increasing the sustainability of their
   existing buildings from social, environmental, economic, and technical
   perspectives. Several studies indicate that conflicting stakeholder
   requirements are a main barrier in implementing sustainable retrofits
   with the decision often made based purely on short-term economic
   grounds. However, most studies did not take into account the important
   role that different stakeholders can play in determining the type and
   extent of any retrofit measures, or develop methodologies that integrate
   social, environmental, economic, and technical concerns. In this
   research, a House of Quality (HOQ) model is developed that synthesizes
   differences among the stakeholders and integrates their competing
   objectives to establish hierarchy of retrofits that meet the stakeholder
   requirements in using the existing building. The developed model is
   tested on a decision to sustainably retrofit an existing US Navy case
   study building. The HOQ analysis revealed that the stakeholder type for
   this case study did not affect the ranking of their requirements, and in
   general, all 5 of the main groups of stakeholders involved in this
   study, agreed without persuasion that the primary reasons for
   implementing sustainable retrofits in each of the four main systems are
   to save energy, reduce costs, and adhere to policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we assessed the effect of additionally broadened quantum
   dash (Qdash) optical transitions in the multi-stack dash-in-a-well laser
   structure at both, material and device level. A broad photoluminescence
   linewidth of similar to 150 nm demonstrates the formation of highly
   inhomogeneous InAs-dashes across the stacks. The transmission electron
   microscopy revealed small (large) average dash height from the Qdash
   stack with thick (thin) over grown barrier layer. The Fabry-Perot laser
   diodes fabricated from this chirped structure exhibits unique device
   physics under the short pulsewidth (SPW) and quasi-continuous wave (QCW)
   operation. Varying the ridge-width (W) from 2 to 4 mu m showed quenching
   of ultrabroad lasing signature in the SPW operation, and consistent even
   for a wide 15 mu m oxide strip laser diode. A lasing spectral split with
   reduced intensity gap in the center is observed in the QCW operation
   with the gap decreasing with increasing ridge-width. Such atypical
   lasing operation, influenced by the waveguiding mechanism is
   qualitatively realized by associating to the reduced vertical coupling
   effect of the Qdash stacks in the operation of small ridge-width lasers
   compared with large ridge-width and oxide stripe lasers, and leading to
   varying non-uniform distribution of carriers among the inhomogeneously
   broadened Qdash stacks in each case. Our chirped 2 x 830 mu m ridge
   laser demonstrated marked improvement in the internal quantum efficiency
   (similar to 80\%) and -3 dB lasing bandwidth, >50 nm centered at similar
   to 1.61 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{A high-resolution subsurface imaging technique based on distributed
   near-ground sensor networks that utilize ultrawideband waveforms in the
   very high frequency (VHF) range is presented. An accurate scattering
   model for a target buried in realistic subsurface environment, modeled
   as a vertically stratified medium, is presented first. Then an inversion
   technique that uses ultrawideband near-field focusing is described. The
   signal penetration depth as a function of frequency and various
   subsurface parameters is calculated based on the developed forward
   model. The imaging resolution as it relates to the accuracy of
   background retrieval is also analyzed. A semi-empirical soil dielectric
   model that is originally developed for the ultra high frequency band is
   modified and validated at the VHF range with measured results available
   in the literature. For a given soil textural composition and frequency,
   the model predicts the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric
   constant as a function of soil moisture content. This soil dielectric
   model is utilized to make the inversion more efficient. To address the
   challenge associated with the design of compact and ultrawideband VHF
   antennas, a scheme utilizing multiple antennas and reduced number of
   frequency points is proposed. The sensor arrangement both in terms of
   spatial distribution and polarization of each antenna as it relates to
   the lateral resolution, as well as minimizing the direct coupling
   between the Tx and Rx antennas, is analyzed. The proposed subsurface
   imaging approach is validated based on numerical techniques and a
   laboratory scale model measurement results.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the vibratory response of structures with complex geometry
   can be challenging especially when their properties (geometry and
   material properties) are not known accurately. These structures can
   suffer also from high modal density, which can result in small changes
   in structural properties creating large changes in the resonant
   response. To address this issue, structural properties could be
   accurately identified, or the structural response could be
   experimentally measured. Both these approaches require collecting
   measurements of higher order vibration modes, which have complicated
   shape. Consequently, high-accuracy positioning of laser beams is
   necessary for vibrometers based on laser Doppler velocimetry. This paper
   presents a methodology to address this challenge. The architecture
   involves a single-point vibrometer, a motion controller,
   translating/rotating stages, and special application software for
   alignment and edge detection. A key novelty of this technology is that
   the beam of the vibrometer is used for both detecting the edges and for
   measuring the vibration. Using a motion controller, the system can
   automatically place/scan and measure the surface of the structure with a
   positioning resolution of 1 mu m. Experimental results are provided to
   demonstrate the new technique.}},

   radioimmunotherapy (Bexxar) yields a nonradioactive antibody antitumor
   response (the so-called cold effect) and a radiation response. Numerical
   parameter determination by least-squares (LS) fitting was implemented
   for more accurate parameter estimates in equivalent biological-effect
   calculations. Methods: One hundred thirty-two tumors in 37 patients were
   followed using five or six SPECT/CT studies per patient, three each
   (typical) post-tracer (0.2 GBq) and post-therapy (approximate to 3 GBq)
   injections. The SPECT/CT data were used to calculate position- and
   time-dependent dose rates and antibody concentrations for each tumor.
   CT-defined tumor volumes were used to track tumor volume changes.
   Combined biological-effect and cell-clearance models were fit to tumor
   volume changes. Optimized parameter values determined using LS fitting
   were compared to previous fitted values that were determined by matching
   calculated to measured tumor volume changes using visual assessment.
   Absorbed dose sensitivity () and cold-effect sensitivity ((p))
   parameters were the primary fitted parameters, yielding equivalent
   biological-effect (E) values. Results: Individual parameter
   uncertainties were approximately 10\% and 30\% for and (p),
   respectively. LS versus previously fit parameter values were highly
   correlated, although the averaged value decreased and the averaged (p)
   value increased for the LS fits compared to the previous fits.
   Correlation of E with 2-month tumor shrinkage data was similar for the
   two fitting techniques. The LS fitting yielded improved fit quality and
   likely improved parameter estimation.}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{379-387}},

Abstract = {{As the use of wind power has steadily increased, the importance of a
   condition monitoring and fault diagnosis system is being emphasized to
   maximize the availability and reliability of wind turbines. To develop
   novel algorithms for fault detection and lifespan estimation, a wind
   turbine simulator is indispensible for verification of the proposed
   algorithms before introducing them into a health monitoring and
   integrity diagnosis system. In this paper, a new type of simulator is
   proposed to develop and verify advanced diagnosis algorithms. The
   simulator adopts a torque control method for a motor and inverter to
   realize variable speed-variable pitch control strategies. Unlike
   conventional motor-generator configurations, the simulator includes
   several kinds of components and a variety of sensors. Specifically, it
   has similarity to a 3 MW wind turbine, thereby being able to acquire a
   state of operation that closely resembles that of the actual 3 MW wind
   turbine operated at various wind conditions. This paper presents the
   design method for the simulator and its control logic. The experimental
   comparison between the behavior of the simulator and that of a wind
   turbine shows that the proposed control logic performs successfully and
   the dynamic behaviors of the simulator have similar trends as those of
   the wind turbine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   tensile hydrostatic stresses}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Density functional theory calculations are employed to investigate the
   energetics of point defects-monovacancy, self-interstitials
   (tetrahedral, octahedral, and dumbbell), and Frenkel pairs-in aluminum
   under tensile hydrostatic stresses. Our study suggests that the defect
   core energy of a vacancy, which is governed solely by the electronic
   structure at the core, significantly depends on the macroscopic
   hydrostatic stress, and that this constitutes an important contribution
   to the formation enthalpy, especially in the regime of extreme tensile
   hydrostatic stresses. This finding is in contrast to widely used elastic
   formulations of point defects based on formation volume that ignore the
   defect core-energy contribution. The formation enthalpies of all point
   defects considered in the present study monotonically decrease with
   increasing tensile hydrostatic stress. Furthermore, we find that the
   formation enthalpies of vacancies and Frenkel pairs are negative beyond
   critical tensile hydrostatic stresses (9 GPa for vacancies and 12 GPa
   for Frenkel pairs), which suggests a spontaneous nucleation of these
   point defects and this has important implications to nucleation
   mechanisms leading to spall failure. In particular, the present findings
   suggest two possible defect nucleation mechanisms leading to spall
   failure: (i) a heterogeneous nucleation of vacancies from defect sources
   and (ii) a homogeneous nucleation of Frenkel pairs at higher hydrostatic
   stresses.}},

Title = {{A unidirectional subwavelength focusing near-field plate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Near-field plates consist of non-periodically patterned surfaces that
   can overcome the diffraction limit and confine electromagnetic fields to
   subwavelength dimensions. Previous near-field plates experimentally
   demonstrated extreme field tailoring capabilities. However, their
   performance suffered from radiation/reflection in undesired directions,
   those other than the subwavelength focus. This issue can limit the
   practical use of near-field plates. In this paper, we address this issue
   by designing a unidirectional near-field plate that can form a
   subwavelength focal pattern, while suppressing the field
   radiated/reflected in other directions. The design and operation of the
   proposed unidirectional near-field plate are verified through full-wave
   simulation. The unidirectional near-field plate may find application in
   high resolution imaging and probing, high density data storage, and
   wireless power transfer systems. As an example, its utility as a high
   resolution probe is demonstrated through full-wave electromagnetic
   simulation. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Noninvasive Quantification of In Vitro Osteoblastic Differentiation in
   3D Engineered Tissue Constructs Using Spectral Ultrasound Imaging}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Non-destructive monitoring of engineered tissues is needed for
   translation of these products from the lab to the clinic. In this study,
   non-invasive, high resolution spectral ultrasound imaging (SUSI) was
   used to monitor the differentiation of MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts seeded
   within collagen hydrogels. SUSI was used to measure the diameter,
   concentration and acoustic attenuation of scatterers within such
   constructs cultured in either control or osteogenic medium over 21 days.
   Conventional biochemical assays were used on parallel samples to
   determine DNA content and calcium deposition. Construct volume and
   morphology were accurately imaged using ultrasound. Cell diameter was
   estimated to be approximately 12.5-15.5 mm using SUSI, which
   corresponded well to measurements of fluorescently stained cells. The
   total number of cells per construct assessed by quantitation of DNA
   content decreased from 5.662.4610 4 at day 1 to 0.960.2610 4 at day 21.
   SUSI estimation of the equivalent number of acoustic scatters showed a
   similar decreasing trend, except at day 21 in the osteogenic samples,
   which showed a marked increase in both scatterer number and acoustic
   impedance, suggestive of mineral deposition by the differentiating MC3T3
   cells. Estimation of calcium content by SUSI was 41.7611.4 mg/ml, which
   agreed well with the biochemical measurement of 38.7616.7 mg/ml. Color
   coded maps of parameter values were overlaid on B-mode images to show
   spatiotemporal changes in cell diameter and calcium deposition. This
   study demonstrates the use of non-destructive ultrasound imaging to
   provide quantitative information on the number and differentiated state
   of cells embedded within 3D engineered constructs, and therefore
   presents a valuable tool for longitudinal monitoring of engineered
   tissue development.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the rapid and anisotropic UV-induced photoconductive
   response of hybrid thin films comprising zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires
   (NWs) directly grown on horizontally aligned (HA-) carbon nanotube (CNT)
   sheets. The films exhibit anisotropic photoconductivity; along the CNTs,
   conductivity is dominated by the CNTs and the photoconductive gain is
   lower, whereas perpendicular to the CNTs the photoconductive gain is
   higher because transport is influenced by ZnO nanoclusters bridging
   CNT-CNT contacts. Because of the distributed electrical contact provided
   by the large number of ZnO NWs on top of the HACNT film, this hybrid
   nanoarchitecture has a significantly greater photocurrent than reported
   for single ZnO NW-based devices at comparable UV illumination intensity.
   Moreover, the hybrid architecture where a thin basal film of ZnO
   ohmically contacts metallic CNTs enables rapid transport of
   photogenerated electrons from ZnO to CNTs, resulting in sub-second
   photoresponse upon pulsed illumination. The built-in potential generated
   across ZnO-CNT heterojunctions competes with the externally applied bias
   to control the photocurrent amplitude and direction. By tuning the
   anisotropic conductivity of the CNT network and the morphology of the
   ZnO or potentially other nanostructured coatings, this material
   architecture may be engineered in the future to realize high-performance
   optical and chemical sensors.}},

Abstract = {{China's unprecedented change offers a unique opportunity for uncovering
   relationships between economic growth and environmental pressure. Here
   we show the trajectories of China's environmental pressure and reveal
   underlying socioeconomic drivers during 1992-2010. Mining and
   manufacturing industries are the main contributors to increasing
   environmental pressure from the producer perspective. Changes in urban
   household consumption, fixed capital formation, and exports are the main
   drivers from the consumer perspective. While absolute decoupling is not
   realized, China has in general achieved relative decoupling between
   economic growth and environmental pressure. China's decoupling
   performance has four distinguishable periods, closely aligning with
   nation-wide major policy adjustments, which indicates significant impact
   of China's national socioeconomic policies on its environmental
   pressure. Material intensity change is the main contributor to the
   mitigation of environmental pressure, except for ammonia nitrogen, solid
   wastes, aquatic Cu, and aquatic Zn. Production structure change is the
   largest contributor to mitigate ammonia nitrogen emissions, and final
   demand structure change is the largest contributor to mitigate emissions
   of solid wastes, aquatic Cu, and aquatic Zn., We observe materialization
   trends for China's production structure and final demand structure
   during 2002-2007. Environmental sustainability can only be achieved by
   timely technology innovation and changes of production structure and
   consumption pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy is a non-invasive tissue ablation method capable of
   fractionating tissue by controlling acoustic cavitation. To determine
   the fractionation susceptibility of various tissues, we investigated
   histotripsy-induced damage on tissue phantoms and ex vivo tissues with
   different mechanical strengths. A histotripsy bubble cloud was formed at
   tissue phantom surfaces using 5-cycle long ultrasound pulses with peak
   negative pressure of 18 MPa and PRFs of 10, 100, and 1000 Hz. Results
   showed significantly smaller lesions were generated in tissue phantoms
   of higher mechanical strength. Histotripsy was also applied to 43
   different ex vivo porcine tissues with a wide range of mechanical
   properties. Gross morphology demonstrated stronger tissues with higher
   ultimate stress, higher density, and lower water content were more
   resistant to histotripsy damage in comparison to weaker tissues. Based
   on these results, a self-limiting vessel-sparing treatment strategy was
   developed in an attempt to preserve major vessels while fractionating
   the surrounding target tissue. This strategy was tested in porcine liver
   in vivo. After treatment, major hepatic blood vessels and bile ducts
   remained intact within a completely fractionated liver volume. These
   results identify varying susceptibilities of tissues to histotripsy
   therapy and provide a rational basis to optimize histotripsy parameters
   for treatment of specific tissues.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{39-57}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{IEEE 802.15.4 provides a widely accepted solution for low-cost and
   low-power wireless communications, and it is known to be applicable to
   many types of WSN application scenarios. To enhance energy efficiency
   and throughput of sensor nodes, many CSMA/CA schemes based on IEEE
   802.15.4 have been proposed. However, they still suffer from unnecessary
   waste of energy and bandwidth due to inefficient backoff management. In
   order to overcome these problems, we propose an enhancement to existing
   schemes, called adaptive collision resolution (ACR). ACR appropriately
   adapts backoff exponent (BE) to the current network contention level
   based on physical and link-layer measurements. In addition, it adjusts
   backoff periods (BP) to avoid meaningless backoffs and additional clear
   channel assessments (CCAs) by using the estimated time remaining until
   the channel becomes idle. To verify the feasibility and applicability of
   our scheme, we studied mathematical analysis and tested it on the Matlab
   and USRP/GNU Radio testbed. We also performed simulation study using
   OPNET, and our simulation results indicate that ACR shows improved
   energy efficiency and throughput performance over existing schemes. (C)

Abstract = {{Many stem cells, including Drosophila germline stem cells (GSCs), divide
   asymmetrically, producing one stem cell and one differentiating
   daughter. Cytokinesis is often asymmetric, in that only one daughter
   cell inherits the midbody ring (MR) upon completion of abscission even
   in apparently symmetrically dividing cells. However, whether the
   asymmetry in cytokinesis correlates with cell fate or has functional
   relevance has been poorly explored. Here we show that the MR is
   asymmetrically segregated during GSC divisions in a centrosome
   age-dependent manner: male GSCs, which inherit the mother centrosome,
   exclude the MR, whereas female GSCs, which we here show inherit the
   daughter centrosome, inherit the MR. We further show that stem cell
   identity correlates with the mode of MR inheritance. Together our data
   suggest that the MR does not inherently dictate stem cell identity,
   although its stereotypical inheritance is under the control of stemness
   and potentially provides a platform for asymmetric segregation of

Abstract = {{Canine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) are promising as
   donor cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). It has been
   suggested that different cell cultures possess different capacities to
   support pre-implantation development of SCNT embryos. The aim of this
   study is to investigate whether two culture medium (RCMEP, Dulbecco's
   modified Eagle's medium {[}DMEM]) affect gene expression of ASCs,
   subsequent development of interspecies SCNT (iSCNT) and gene expression
   of cloned embryos. The RCMEP-cultured cells contained significantly
   greater amounts of SOX2, NANOG, OCT4, DNMT1, and MeCP2 than
   DMEM-cultured cells (P < 0.05). In iSCNT, the use of DMEM medium for
   culturing cells resulted in similar development to the blastocyst stage
   than those derived from RCMEP cultured cells (4.5\% and 3.2\%,
   respectively; P > 0.05). The expression of all transcripts except for
   DNMT1 in cloned blastocysts from RCMEP cultured cells followed those of
   cloned blastocysts derived from DMEM cultured cells. The alteration of
   gene expression in ASCs by culture medium was not manifested in the
   iSCNT embryos derived from these cells. Although the culture medium can
   induce changes of gene expression by ASCs, such alterations in donor
   cells did not affect the developmental competence or gene expression
   patterns of iSCNT embryos. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{184}},

Abstract = {{Coupling between soil moisture, vegetation biomass, and energy fluxes is
   characterized by nonlinearities and thus current land surface
   parameterizations with aggregated surface response may produce biased
   results. This study aims to improve the understanding of the coupling
   modes between fine-, tree-scale (few meters) canopy and soil moisture
   variations, and their impacts on spatially integrated energy and water
   fluxes. The study was carried out for a spatially heterogeneous,
   temperate mixed forest environment of Northern Michigan located near the
   University of Michigan Biological Station. A high-resolution,
   physically-based ecohydrological model (tRIBS + VEGGIE) was used as a
   data integration tool to upscale spatial heterogeneities resolved at a
   tree-scale to a coarse-scale (several kilometers). Several simulation
   cases involving tree-scale variations in initial soil moisture, leaf
   area, and radiative forcing were designed. In order to infer the effects
   of coarse-scale aggregation, a lumped case representing the commonly
   used spatially-lumped representation was also simulated. The results
   demonstrate that heterogeneous canopy biomass determines the spatial
   dynamics of soil moisture. The spatial distribution of canopy height may
   play a particularly important role in determining the domain-scale
   fluxes when a forest system is in moisture-limiting conditions.
   Specifically, the tree-scale effects on light exposure and shading
   result in smaller spatially aggregated transpiration and lower water
   stress as compared to the results of the lumped representation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A large variety of nanoparticles were synthesized during the last 25
   years and are used now as ``building blocks{''} for a variety of
   materials. Bottom-up solution processing of devices emerged as a
   promising direction of their technological applications because this
   method can (a) utilize intrinsic ability of nanocolloids to
   self-organize, (b) reduce high energy and equipment cost of device
   manufacturing, and (c) impart new functionalities to electronic devices.
   However the technological impact of solution processable semiconductor
   materials although potentially considerable-has been so far limited
   because of the long-standing dilemma between the need for effective
   colloidal stabilization of nanoparticles and effective charge transport.
   Surfactants and other organic materials being used to synthesize and/or
   disperse nanocolloids introduce a barrier for charge transport between
   the particles. Although these barriers do make it impossible to use them
   in electronic devices, they certainly make it more difficult. In this
   review, we look into the latest progress in the solution processable
   devices and methods to produce electrically conductive thin films from
   nanoscale dispersions. We are specifically interested in the
   understanding of the prospects of self-assembly to facilitate charge
   transport and nanoscale connectivity during solution processing. The
   updated theoretical description of charge transport in nanoparticle
   solids and similar nanomaterials is also given. It includes
   consideration of the key mechanisms such as tunneling and cotunneling,
   as well as key electrical parameters characterizing transport of
   electrons through the surfactant-related barriers, such as coupling
   energy and Coulombic charging energy. Manifestations of these mechanisms
   in different electronic materials made from nanoparticles, nanowires,
   nanotubes, and nanosheets and their relative advantages and
   disadvantages are also discussed. We conclude the topic with a brief
   description of new opportunities and approaches to improve charge
   transport in solution processed materials from nanoscale dispersions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper was to investigate the oxidation behavior of three
   pressureless sintered ceramic composites of silicon carbide (SiC) matrix

   wt\%) at various temperatures (i.e., 600-1100 degrees C) and durations
   (i.e., 2-12 h). The results indicate that the oxidation of SiC/C-p
   ceramics in air is uniformly controlled by the oxidation of C-p at <700
   degrees C, and the strength of the samples reaches a minimum value at
   700 degrees C. At 700-900 degrees C, the oxidation is controlled via the
   unequal diffusion of O-2 through the micro-cracks. The oxidation of
   SiC/C-p is controlled by O-2 diffusion through the structural defects of
   the matrix at 900-1100 degrees C, and the strength of the composites
   increases at 1000 degrees C and reaches a maximum value during the
   initial period of 2 h due to the formation of SiO2 layer and the healing
   of the matrix defects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The transition from a spectrum filter (resonant transmission) to a
   polarizer (broadband transmission) for TM polarized light is observed in
   a metallic nano-slit array as period is decreased. A theoretical model
   is developed and shows that the spectrum filter behavior is caused by
   the coupled slit/grating resonance. With decreasing period, the slit
   resonance is decoupled from the grating resonance, which then dominates
   the transmission spectrum and broadens the transmission peak. With
   further reducing period, the slit resonance diminishes and the peak
   spectrum transforms to a broadband transmission. This effect is the
   basis for the operation of wire grid polarizers. The transition is
   explained by the change of the impedance to the incoming wave.}},

Abstract = {{Bioreductive in situ treatment of U-contaminated groundwater can convert
   soluble U(VI) species to immobile reduced U(IV) solid phases such as
   UO2(s) to contain U movement. Once active bioremediation is halted, UO2
   may be subsequently reoxidized if oxidants such as oxygen enter the
   reducing zone. However, iron sulfide minerals that form during
   bioreduction may serve as electron sources or oxygen scavengers and
   inhibit UO2 reoxidation upon oxygen intrusion. In this study,
   flow-through reactor experiments examined the abiotic kinetics of UO2
   oxidative dissolution in the presence of oxygen and nanoparticulate FeS
   as a function of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and FeS
   content. The UO2 dissolution rates in the presence of FeS were over 1
   order of magnitude lower than those in the absence of FeS under
   otherwise comparable oxic conditions. FeS effectively scavenged DO and
   preferentially reacted with oxygen, contributing to a largely unreacted
   UO2 solid phase during an ``inhibition period{''} as determined by X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The removal of DO by FeS was significant
   but incomplete during the inhibition period, resulting in
   surface-oxidation-limited dissolution and greater UO2 dissolution rate
   with increasing influent DO concentration and decreasing FeS content.
   Although the rate was independent of Solution pH in the range of
   6.1-8.1, the length of the inhibition period was shortened by
   substantial FeS dissolution at slightly acidic pH. The reducing capacity
   of FeS was greatest at basic pH where surface-mediated FeS oxidation
   dominated.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering the atomic structure of an inorganic semiconductor to create
   isolated one-dimensional (ID) magnetic subunits that are embedded within
   the semiconducting crystal lattice can enable chemical and electronic
   manipulation of magnetic ordering within the magnetic domains, paving
   the way for (1) the investigation of new physical phenomena such as the
   interactions between electron transport and localized magnetic moments
   at the atomic scale and (2) the design and fabrication of geometrically
   frustrated magnetic materials featuring cooperative long-range ordering
   with large magnetic moments. We report the design, synthesis, crystal
   structure and magnetic behavior of (MnxPb2-x)Pb2Sb4Se10, a family of
   three-dimensional manganese-bearing main-group metal selenides featuring
   quasi-isolated {[}(MnxPb2-x)(3)Se-30](infinity) hexanuclear magnetic
   ladders coherently embedded and uniformly distributed within a purely
   inorganic semiconducting framework, {[}Pb2Sb4Se10]. Careful structural
   analysis of the magnetic subunit, {[}(MnxPb2-x)(3)Se-30](infinity) and
   the temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility of
   (MnxPb2-x)Pb2Sb4Se10, indicate that the compounds are geometrically
   frustrated 1D ferromagnets. Interestingly, the degree of geometrical
   spin frustration (f) within the magnetic ladders and the strength of the
   intrachain antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions strongly depend on the
   concentration (x value) and the distribution of the Mn atom within the
   magnetic substructure. The combination of strong intrachain AFM
   interactions and geometrical spin frustration in the
   {[}(MnxPb2-x)(3)Se-30](infinity) ladders results in a cooperative
   ferromagnetic order with exceptionally high magnetic moment at around
   125 K. Magnetotransport study of the Mn2Pb2Sb4Se10 composition over the
   temperature range from 100 to 200 K revealed negative magnetoresistance
   (NMR) values and also suggested a strong contribution of magnetic
   polarons to the observed large effective magnetic moments.}},

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by recent experiments, we present here a detailed theoretical
   analysis of the joule heating in current-carrying single-molecule
   junctions. By combining the Landauer approach for quantum transport with
   ab initio calculations, we show how the heating in the electrodes of a
   molecular junction is determined by its electronic structure. In
   particular, we show that in general heat is not equally dissipated in
   both electrodes of the junction and it depends on the bias polarity (or
   equivalently on the current direction). These heating asymmetries are
   intimately related to the thermopower of the junction as both these
   quantities are governed by very similar principles. We illustrate these
   ideas by analyzing single-molecule junctions based on benzene
   derivatives with different anchoring groups. The close relation between
   heat dissipation and thermopower provides general strategies for
   exploring fundamental phenomena such as the Peltier effect or the impact
   of quantum interference effects on the joule heating of molecular
   transport junctions.}},

Abstract = {{Text-overlaid images abound in product design and human-computer
   interfaces (e.g., greeting cards and photo slideshows that overlay texts
   on large background images). This study proposes computational models of
   perceived aesthetics appeal of text-overlaid images as a function of
   their white-space fractions. Four models are proposed, including
   Character-based Page White-Space Fraction (W-CP ), Character-based
   Background White-Space Fraction (W-CB ), Bounding Box based Page
   White-Space Fraction (W-BP ), and Bounding Box based Background
   White-Space Fraction (W-BB ). Two experiments, using single-spaced and
   double-spaced texts, were conducted to investigate the relationships
   between the model predictions and the perceived aesthetic appeal of
   text-overlaid images. The results show that the Bounding Box based
   Background White-Space Fraction (W-BB ), defined as the area ratio
   between the bounding rectangle of texts and the background region of
   image, is most valuable in modelling the subjective aesthetic appeal.
   The regression curves show that the optimal W-BB is close to 0.8.}},

   These models can thus help improve the process of developing in-vehicle

   can help improve traffic flow simulation. This article develops a
   dual-task model of driving with a visual distraction task using the
   Queuing Network model of driver lateral control and a logistic
   regression model. The comparison between the model simulation data and
   the human data from drivers in a driving simulator shows that this
   computational model can perform driving with a secondary visual task
   well and its performance is consistent with the driver data.}},

Abstract = {{In order to select the optimum parameters for friction stir welding of
   twin-roll cast (TRC) AZ31B Mg-Al-Cu alloy, ``mechanical and
   microstructural characterizations are performed on friction stir welded
   3 mm thick sheets under different processing parameters of rotational
   spindle speed and feed rate. Used was a tool made from high resistance
   Sverker 21 steel alloy with a 19 mm diameter cylindrical shoulder and a
   6.4 mm diameter pin that extrudes 2.7 mm from the bottom of the
   shoulder. A large number of welded joints were prepared according to a
   test matrix of various combinations of rotational speed and feed rate.
   Tensile tests at different temperatures and strain rates were performed
   on specimens cut with their major axis perpendicular to the welded
   joints. Static strength tests of these specimens revealed that joints
   welded at a speed of 1200 rpm and a feed of 150 mm/min resulted in
   strengths as high as 94\% of that of the as received TRC AZ31B metal.
   For specimens welded at spindle speeds larger than 1400 rpm,
   microstructural observations revealed the presence of micro cracks and
   voids located in the zone between the nugget and the thermally affected
   zone. In order to monitor the effect of lengthy testing times and the
   observed grain growth associated with slow strain tests, annealing tests
   under different temperatures and time durations were performed while
   monitoring grain diameter. Very limited grain growth have been obsereved
   after annealing and thus the mechanical performnace of the joints was
   solely due to the effect of the friction stir welding.}},

   generalization of a simple input observer, that has been previously used

   semi-global practical closed-loop stability properties, i.e., under
   suitable assumptions it achieves an arbitrarily large domain of
   attraction if the observer gain is sufficiently high. In addition, the
   proposed control scheme facilitates the application of reference
   governors for non-conservative treatment of constrained systems with
   large disturbances. The paper illustrates the potential for use of such
   a control scheme for aircraft and spacecraft control applications.}},

Abstract = {{We studied and characterized the beam steering effect for THz radiation
   based on the doubly-corrugated spoofed surface plasmon polariton
   (DC-SSPP) architecture and analyzed the design of a high-speed THz
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Metal-covered GaAs are used to form
   both arms of an interferometer, while voltage-controlled, localized
   carrier concentration provides modulation to the signal propagating
   phase. Relative phase differences between THz beams in separate arms of
   the interferometer can give rise to deflected radiation in the far
   field, which is further converted to a digitized output by a spatially
   arranged detector array. Applying the beam deflector with a full
   differential implementation of the input voltage signal and a
   combination of nonlinear detector arrays with carefully designed gain
   and saturation power, a 3-bit ADC with >60 GS/s operation speed and
   direct digitized readout is demonstrated.}},

   with periodic perfect conductor patches on its top and bottom is
   demonstrated. The performance is based on waveguide-cavity-waveguide

Abstract = {{Memristors promise higher device density and design flexibility. Besides
   utilizing memristors for digital memory, another promising avenue for
   adoption is the advancement of neural network circuits capable of
   learning. Neural network implementations with memristors have been
   proposed, including memristor synaptic training methodologies. This work
   highlights applications of a neural learning methodology inspired by
   Q-learning. Memristors are used as analog storage elements to store a
   large Q-table. The method is qualified with a maze problem in order to
   show that the proposed network can be used to learn to approximate an
   optimal path to solving the maze problem. Brief results highlighting the
   methodology on a maze problem and discussion on generating random keys
   are provided. This work combines model-free reinforcement learning with
   neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem cells provide a potential promising therapeutic approach
   for tissue regeneration. With the advent of microfluidic technology we
   can more closely recapitulate features of the native tissue environment.
   Here we use a contemporary compartmentalized device to culture mouse
   embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and differentiate them with a defined
   neuronal medium into process-extending ``neurons{''} that traverse a set
   of microgrooves from one compartment containing cell bodies to another
   that is devoid of cell bodies. This device allows spatial isolation of
   medium and cell parts, and contains a series of microgrooves that guide
   the paths of neuronal processes. We will use this new culturing approach
   to determine how various soluble factors or tissue targets might
   influence neuronal differentiation during development.}},

Abstract = {{High resolution TEM imaging was performed of a two layer 1.50 +/- 0.09..
   m thick AlN film deposited using the Tegal AMS 2004 S-gun magnetron
   sputter system on 565nm of thermal oxide. The AlN film was deposited in
   two depositions, with vacuum broken in between. Process induced faults
   and dislocations are observed at both the AlN-substrate interface and at
   the film location where vacuum was broken, but irregularities are
   generally resolved within 5nm. Additional roughness and stacking faults
   are observed in the last 6nm of film deposition. Bright field imaging of
   the film shows a distinct line of discontinuity at the film location
   where vacuum was broken between depositions; however, the grain
   structure of the film remains largely continuous across the
   discontinuity. A film deposited under the same conditions as the
   measured sample, but deposited in one deposition, had comparable stress
   (<50 MPa), thickness, and grain size properties. Increased XRD rocking
   curve FWHM values for the two deposition film (1.29+/-0.01 degrees) as
   compared with the single deposition film (0.97+/-0.01 degrees) is likely
   due to the stacking irregularities introduced at the location where
   vacuum was broken.}},

Abstract = {{Ship weather routing is routinely employed to assist ship-masters in
   avoiding storms. During these storms, however, both material and
   hydrodynamic nonlinearities grow with the significant wave height (H-S).
   Hence, to fully understand the importance of weather routing, it may be
   necessary to go beyond a conventional spectral-based fatigue analysis
   which incorporates a linear damage hypothesis (i.e., the Palmgren-Miner
   rule).
   To this end, the present paper examines macroscopic fatigue crack growth
   in which the nonlinear phenomena omitted in current design practices are
   included. We start by considering time-dependent ship structural loading
   sequences which include nonlinear wave-induced bending and whipping
   responses taken from time-domain seakeeping simulations. These stresses
   are then analyzed using a fatigue crack growth model previously
   developed by the authors {[}1] in which material hysteresis is included
   using a mechanistic rather than phenomenological approach based on
   numerical simulations requiring only experimentally measured fatigue
   crack growth rates under constant amplitude cyclic loading (e.g., ASTM
   E647-13) and a full material constitutive model defined through
   experimental push-pull tests for the same material. Using this approach,
   we quantify the importance of weather routing by systematically
   substituting storms above a certain threshold with more moderate sea
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new structural strain method is presented to extend the
   early structural stress based master S-N curve method to low cycle
   fatigue regime in which plastic deformation can be significant while an
   elastic core is still present. The method is formulated by taking
   advantage of elastically calculated mesh-insensitive structural stresses
   based on nodal forces available from finite element solutions. The
   structural strain definition is consistent with classical plate and
   shell theory in which a linear through-thickness deformation field is
   assumed a priori in both elastic and elastic-plastic regimes. With
   considerations of both yield and equilibrium conditions, the resulting
   structural strains are analytically solved if assuming elastic and
   perfectly plastic material behavior. The formulation can be readily
   extended to strain-hardening materials for which structural strains can
   be numerically calculated with ease. The method is shown effective in
   correlating low-cycle fatigue test data of various sources documented in
   the literature into a single narrow scatter band which is remarkable
   consistent with the scatter band of the existing master S-N curve
   adopted ASME B\&PV Code since 2007.
   With this new method, some of the inconsistencies of the pseudo-elastic
   structural stress procedure in 2007 ASME Div 2 Code can now be
   eliminated, such as its use of Neuber's rule in approximating structural
   strain beyond yield. More importantly, both low cycle and high cycle
   fatigue behaviors can now be treated in a unified manner. The earlier
   mesh-insensitive structural stress based master S-N curve method can now
   be viewed as an application of the structural strain method in high
   cycle regime, in which structural strains are linearly related to
   traction-based structural stresses according to Hook's law. In low-cycle
   regime, the structural strain method characterizes fatigue damage
   directly in terms of structural strains that satisfy linear
   through-thickness deformation gradient assumption, material nonlinear
   behavior, and equilibrium conditions. The use of a pseudo-elastic
   structural stress definition is not fundamental, but merely a means to
   put low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue test data in a conventional
   stress-based S-N data representation which is typically preferred in
   engineering practice, than a strain-based representation.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that residual stresses caused by weld repairs tend can
   be significantly higher than those caused by initial fabrication welds
   due to severe restraint conditions associated with typical weld repairs.
   This paper presents an in-depth investigation of repair weld geometry
   effects on residual stress distribution characteristics, particularly in
   terms of the through-thickness membrane and bending content that can be
   shown fundamentally different from that in initial fabrication welds.
   The results indicate that repair weld design parameters in terms of
   repair length, depth, and width are of critical importance to the
   mitigation of residual stresses. A 3D finite element residual stress
   modeling procedure developed and validated for numerous case studies in
   the past, after further validation on a selected component in the
   current study, is used throughout this investigation.}},

   the polarization of the radiated field of this antenna, the relative

   composed of a horizontal dipole, vertical dipole, and two circular loops
   connecting the adjacent arms of the dipole clements. The arc length and
   geometry of the loops are designed to generate circular polarization at
   the antenna's boresight. Using a single feed point, it is shown that the
   antenna is cable of producing all polarizations in different directions
   with almost isotropic radiation pattern. To show the validity of the
   design an antenna structure over a ground was fabricated and measured at
   2.58 GHz. The measured radiation pattern and polarization compares very

   impedance surfaces are examined. Such surfaces consist of a
   subwavelength patterned metallic cladding over a grounded dielectric
   substrate, with the cladding modelled by an anisotropic tensor sheet

   simple closed-form expressions for the power flow direction are obtained
   by calculating the Poynting vector. The direction of power flow is first
   expressed in terms of the ratio of two normal field components. The
   ratio is then evaluated by using an eigenvalue equation. The proposed

   proposed method, instead of using a large array of transmitting and
   receiving antennas which usually limits the imaging of the buildings'
   interior from outside, a limited number of transceivers mounted on
   moving robots are used. As robots move, reflected signal is sampled at
   different positions. By applying an appropriate beam forming technique
   to the samples of the scattered signal, a 360 degrees view of the
   building interior can be obtained with a high cross-range resolution and
   significantly reduce the ambiguity in the detection of the objects'
   positions. Applying this method enables imaging of buildings from inside
   which results in obtaining more accurate map of buildings' interiors.}},

   maintaining a good optical transparency. First, the behavior of MEFSSs
   is studied using a basic circuit model. The relationship between the
   circuit and design parameters is then derived and it is shown that one
   of the main limiting factors in achieving both a high bandwidth and low
   opacity design is the maximum realizable capacitance between the
   adjacent cells. Several methods of increasing the capacitance between
   the adjacent cells are then presented. It is shown that using a certain
   arrangement of elements on multiple layers, the bandwidth of a
   single-pole MEFSS can be increased without increasing its opacity. The
   performance of the proposed MEFSS is then numerically analysed and
   compared with the traditional MEFSSs.}},

   mathematical modal expansion for connect loops of metallic frames in
   conjunction with a macro-modeling approach is used to estimate the
   induced currents for elementary sources such as short dipoles or plane

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel travelling-wave frequency beam-scanning
   array antenna operating at Y-band. The proposed antenna is composed of
   over 40 cavity-backed patch arrays as the radiating elements, with a
   total of 588 patch elements. The array generates a very narrow beam
   (HPBW of less than 2.5 degrees) at the broadside of the antenna with +/-
   25 degrees steering capability. A prototype of the proposed antenna is
   fabricated using silicon micromachining with high level of accuracy and
   low mass and cost. To characterize the micromachined antenna a novel
   waveguide-probe near-field measurement setup is proposed and good
   agreement between the measurement and the full-wave simulation results
   of the antenna is shown.}},

Abstract = {{Measured results of a four-terminal directly heated RF phase change

   resistance change element, connecting the RF input/output lines. The
   resistivity of GeTe is switched between the high-resistance
   amorphous-state value of several k Omega and low-resistance crystallized
   value of less than 3.9 Omega in less than 404 mu sec using current
   pulses passing though GeTe. The loss of this ohmic switch at ON state is
   less than 0.5 dB with isolation of more than 18 dB at frequencies up to
   20 GHz, indicating a cutoff frequency of > 4 THz. The switch active area
   is less than 5 mu m x 20 mu m with GeTe volume of only 1.5 mu m x 15 mu
   m x 0.25 mu m. The results presented in this paper prove phase change

Abstract = {{One approach to vibration control is to apply a force to a primary
   structure which opposes excitation, effectively canceling the external
   disturbance. A familiar passive example of this approach is the linear
   tuned mass absorber. In this spirit, the utility of a bistable
   attachment for attenuating vibrations, especially in terms of the
   high-orbit, snap through dynamic, is investigated using the harmonic
   balance method and experiments. Analyses demonstrate the fundamental
   harmonic snap through dynamic, having commensurate frequency with the
   single-frequency harmonic excitation, may yield displacements either
   substantially in-phase or out-of-phase with the primary structure.
   During in-phase snap through, forces are generated by the bistable
   oscillator which reinforce the applied loading, resulting in dramatic
   amplification of primary system response. During out-of-phase snap
   through, forces are generated which are only partially opposed to the
   input, leading to a measure of host structure attenuation. The
   experiments verify the analytical findings and also uncover nonlinear
   dynamics not predicted by the analysis that have slightly favorable
   vibration suppression performance when compared with the out-of-phase,
   fundamental harmonic snap through action.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the power harvesting performance of a piezoelectric (PZT)
   ceramic multilayer stack actuator under a shock event is theoretically
   and experimentally investigated. The model is derived from the
   constitutive 33 mode equations under single degree of freedom (SDOF)
   assumptions, and then a correction factor is applied onto the resulting
   electromechanically coupled governing equations. These are represented
   in state space form and solved in the numerical computation software
   MATLAB. In order to achieve experimental validation, two test cases are
   compared to the model prediction when impulses of 20.8 mN.s and 1.70
   ml\textbackslash{}I-s are loaded on to the PZT stack actuator. The
   voltage and power output between the model and the test cases matched
   well. For the first case, the PZT stack actuator harvested 0.3321 11J
   from the shock event while the model's prediction was 0.3358 1.0, which
   results in a percent error of only 1.1\%. In the second case, the PZT
   stack actuator harvested 34.64 nJ from the shock event while the model's
   prediction was 35.80 nJ, which results in a percent error of 3.2\%. This
   paper achieves its objective of deriving a model that can accurately
   predict the power harvested when an impulse load is applied onto a PZT
   stack actuator, and then validating this model with testing.}},

Abstract = {{We study targeted energy transfer (TET) mechanisms by applying a
   nonlinear energy sink (VES) to suppress regenerative instabilities in a
   2-DOF planar machine tool model. With the help of a numerical
   continuation tool, DDEBIFTOOL, we show that the tool instability is
   generated through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation in this simplified tool
   model. Studying modal energy exchanges reveals that only one of the DOFs
   is predominant, which may lead to the standard single-DOF machine tool
   model. Then, we apply an ungrounded NES to the 2-DOF tool model such
   that the NES interacts only with the dominant mode, which turns out to
   be more efficient than applying the NES to the other insignificant mode.
   Simple numerical simulations and bifurcation analysis demonstrate that
   the three typical TET mechanisms can be identified - That is, recurrent
   burstouts and suppression, and partial and complete suppression of tool
   instability.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, we studied the integrated dynamics of a coupled linear
   oscillator-bistable energy harvester system. The method of harmonic
   balance together with perturbation analysis are used to predict the
   existence and stability of the bistable device interwell vibration. The
   influences of important parameters on tailoring the coupled system
   response are investigated to determine principles for improved energy
   harvesting performance. We demonstrate analytically that for excitation
   frequencies in a bandwidth less than the natural frequency of the linear
   oscillator, the additional linear system may substantially intensify the
   bistable harvester power generation as compared to a single bistable
   device. Moreover, the linear-bistable coupled system may introduce a
   stable out-of-phase dynamic between the linear and bistable elements
   around the resonance of the linear oscillator, enhancing the performance
   of the harvester by providing for a second interwell response. Key
   analytical findings are confirmed through experiments, validating the
   predicted trends and demonstrating the advantages of the coupled system
   for energy harvesting}},

Abstract = {{For semi-isolated communities, fresh water may be scarce; however,
   brackish water or seawater can be easily accessed. This provides a drive
   to develop optimum-cost desalination system for such communities. This
   paper presents the optimization of a water-heated solar-powered
   humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination system with variable
   saline water flow rate. The design variables include the sizing of solar
   collector, storage tank and its internal heat exchanger, humidifier and
   dehumidifier. A program was developed to predict performance based on
   selected weather data file and optimize the system for minimum unit cost
   of produced fresh water. System cost is predicted via different
   first-order estimators. A tailored optimization technique is used and
   compared to a genetic algorithm procedure in the design optimization for
   local climate and market. A case study develops an optimum desalination
   plant for the Red Sea near the city of Hurgada and compared to

Abstract = {{Level-set approaches are a family of domain classification techniques
   that rely on defining a scalar level-set function (LSF), then carrying
   out the classification based on the value of the function relative to
   one or more thresholds. Most continuum topology optimization
   formulations are at heart, a classification problem of the design domain
   into structural materials and void. As such, level-set approaches are
   gaining acceptance and popularity in structural topology optimization.
   In conventional level set approaches, finding an optimum LSF involves
   solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi system of partial differential equations
   with a large number of degrees of freedom, which in turn, cannot be
   accomplished without gradients information of the objective being
   optimized. A new approach is proposed in this paper where design
   variables are defined as the explicit values of the LSF at knot points,
   then a Kriging model is used to interpolate the LSF values within the
   rest of the domain so that classification into material or void can be
   performed. Perceived advantages of the explicit level-set (ELS) approach
   include alleviating the need for gradients of objectives and
   constraints, while maintaining a reasonable number of design variables
   that is independent from the mesh size. A hybrid genetic algorithm (GA)
   is then used for solving the optimization problem(s). An example problem
   of a short cantilever is studied under various settings of the ELS
   parameters in order to infer the best practice recommendations for
   tuning the approach. Capabilities of the approach are then further
   demonstrated by exploring its performance on several test problems.}},

Abstract = {{Fresh water availability is essential for the economic development in
   small communities in remote areas. In desert climate, where naturally
   occurring fresh water is scarce, seawater or brackish water from wells
   is often more abundant. Since water desalination approaches are energy
   intensive, a strong motivation exists for the design of cost-effective
   desalination systems that utilize the abundant renewable energy
   resource; solar energy. This paper presents an optimization model of a
   solar-powered reverse osmosis (RO) desalination system. RO systems rely
   on pumping salty water at high pressure through semi-permeable membrane
   modules. Under sufficient pressure, water molecules will flow through
   the membranes, leaving salt ions behind, and are collected in a fresh
   water stream. Since RO system are primarily powered via electricity, the
   system model incorporates photovoltaic (PTO panels, and battery storage
   for smoothing out fluctuations in the PV power output, as well as
   allowing system operation for a number of hours after sunset. Design
   variables include sizing of the PV solar collectors, battery storage
   capacity, as well as the sizing of the RO system membrane module and
   power elements. The objective is to minimize the cost of unit volume
   produced fresh water, subject to constraints on production capacity. A
   genetic algorithm is used to generate and compare optimal designs for
   two different locations near the Red Sea and Sinai.}},

Abstract = {{The present work proposes a new algorithm for the optimization of
   cutting parameters in the high speed drilling of woven composites. The
   cutting parameters under consideration are the feed rate and the spindle
   speed. Three performance parameters are to be minimized. These are the
   exit delamination, the surface roughness and the thrust force. These
   performance parameters are observed experimentally. One of the
   challenges that face the experimental testing of these parameters is the
   high cost of the drilling tools and specimen materials. Therefore, the
   minimization of the number of experimental tests is a necessary
   requirement. The algorithm presented hybridizes Kriging as a
   meta-modeling technique with evolutionary multi-objective optimization
   to optimize the cutting parameters while intelligently selecting the new
   set of cutting parameters in each iteration. After starting with a
   factorial design of the search space, and after testing the performance
   criteria at these points, the algorithm fits a multidimensional surface
   using Kriging. This step is followed by an evolutionary search on the
   fitted model. The search spreads a population of search points in the
   direction of better performance criteria as well as in the direction of
   un-sampled space. The previous two steps are conducted iteratively for a
   pre-defined number of iterations. In the final iteration, the population
   of search points is clustered to yield a small number of new points at
   which the new experiments will be conducted. The whole process is
   iterated until the maximum number of allowable experiments is achieved.
   The algorithm is tested using an existing set of previously published
   experimental data that are dense enough to predict the actual response
   surface of the performance criteria. Results showed that the algorithm
   smartly moved into the direction of higher performance criteria with a
   low number of experimental trials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a Copula-based sampling method for data-driven
   prognostics and health management (PHM). The principal idea is to first
   build statistical relationship between failure time and the time
   realizations at specified degradation levels on the basis of off-line
   training data sets, then identify possible failure times for on-line
   testing units based on the constructed statistical model and available
   on-line testing data. Specifically, three technical components are
   proposed to implement the methodology. First of all, a generic health
   index system is proposed to represent the health degradation of
   engineering systems. Next, a Copula-based modeling is proposed to build
   statistical relationship between failure time and the time realizations
   at specified degradation levels. Finally, a sampling approach is
   proposed to estimate the failure time and remaining useful life (RUL) of
   on-line testing units. Two case studies, including a bearing system in
   electric cooling fans and a 2008 IEEE PHM challenge problem, are
   employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective in precision machining is usually to attain
   excellent dimensional accuracy and surface finish. In addition,
   complimentary objectives such as cost and production rate are also
   important. Proper selection of cutting parameters can profoundly affect
   both primary and secondary machining performance objectives. While
   simplified and/or empirical models exist for machining processes, none
   of those models provides accurate prediction of the dynamic cutting
   forces, which in turn govern the obtainable quality of the machined
   surfaces. Finite element analysis (PEA) via ABAQUS/Explicit is adopted
   in this paper for predicting the machining dynamic cutting forces. Rake
   and clearance angles, as well as cutting speed are set as the design
   variables for optimization. Since the machining model requires
   significant computational resources, economizing the number of FEA runs
   is desirable. The optimization approach adopted is based off Efficient
   Global Optimization (EGO), where Kriging models are trained to predict
   the underlying behavior of the machining process via a finite set of
   sample points. New sample points are then generated via a
   multi-objective genetic algorithm that seeks locations of optima and/or
   high uncertainty in the Kriging models. Machining performance of the new
   samples is then evaluated via FEA, the Kriging models are re-trained and
   the process is repeated until one of termination criteria is met. The
   application study presented is an orthogonal cutting test for
   ultra-precision micro-cutting using diamond tools.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the problem of eliciting the most preferred designs of a user
   from a finite set of designs through iterative pairwise comparisons
   presented to the user The key challenge is to select proper queries
   (i.e., presentations of design pairs to the user) in order to minimize
   the number of queries. Previous work formulated elicitation as a
   blackbox optimization problem with comparison (binary) outputs, and a
   heuristic search algorithm similar to Efficient Global Optimization
   (EGO) was used to solve it. In this paper, we propose a query algorithm
   that minimizes the expected number of queries directly, assuming that
   designs are embedded in a known space and user preference is a linear
   function of design variables. Besides its theoretical foundation, the
   proposed algorithm shows empirical performance better than the EGO
   search algorithm in both simulated and real-user experiments. A novel
   approximation scheme is also introduced to alleviate the scalability
   issue of the proposed algorithm, making it tractable for a large number
   of design variables or of candidate designs.}},

Abstract = {{We present an extensible-link kinematic model for characterizing the
   motion trajectory of an arbitrary planar compliant mechanism. This is
   accomplished by creating an analogous kinematic model consisting of
   links that change length over the course of actuation to represent
   elastic deformation of the compliant mechanism. Within the model, the
   motion trajectory is represented as an analytical function. By Taylor
   series expansion, the trajectory is expressed in a parametric
   formulation composed of load-independent and load-dependent terms. Here,
   the load-independent terms are entirely defined by the shape of the
   undeformed compliant mechanism topology, and all load-geometry
   interdependencies are captured by the load-dependent terms. This
   formulation adds insight to the process for designing compliant
   mechanisms for high accuracy motion applications because: (1) inspection
   of the load-independent terms enables determination of specific topology
   modifications for improving the accuracy of the motion trajectory; and
   (2) the load-dependent terms reveal the polynomial orders of principally
   uncorrectable error components of the motion trajectory. The error
   components in the trajectory simply represent the deviation of the
   actual motion trajectory provided by the compliant mechanism compared to
   the ideally desired one. We develop the generalized model framework, and
   then demonstrate its utility by designing a compliant micro-gripper with
   straight-line parallel jaw motion. We use the model to analytically
   determine all topology modifications for optimizing the jaw trajectory,
   and to predict the polynomial order of the uncorrectable trajectory
   components. The jaw trajectory is then optimized by iterative finite
   elements (FE) simulation until the polynomial order of the uncorrectable
   trajectory component becomes apparent.}},

Abstract = {{Soft robots allow for complex continuum motions and shapes that conform
   to their environment. Using a fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosure
   (FREE) driven by fluid provides a high power density, soft continuum
   actuator. While the force generation for a small subset of this
   structure known as McKibben actuators has been studied extensively, the
   force and moments generated by a wider set of fiber reinforcements have
   not been previously investigated. Using virtual work and kinematics
   derived front fiber inextensibility and fluid incompressibility, the
   force and moments for the entire design space of FREEs has been
   determined analytically. Graphical representations have been created,
   providing easy tools for synthesis and analysis of force and moments in
   all possible FREEs. The hydraulic displacement amplification, or
   volumetric transduction, of output motion to fluid displacement has also
   been determined using kinematics; this transduction gives an indication
   of stiffness of the structure. Graphical representations have also been
   created, providing a designer with an intuitive understanding of the
   behavior all FREE topologies.}},

Abstract = {{Lightweight mechanical energy-storage devices or springs with nonlinear
   strain-energy absorption rate are important building blocks for
   passive/quasi-passive rehabilitation robotics. They provide support and
   controllable energy storage/release into the system thereby making daily
   activities such as walking/running metabolically efficient for the
   disabled. These devices have stringent footprint constraints and must
   withstand 10 million cycles of loading for successful implementation on
   an orthotic device. Currently, there are no off-the-shelf springs or a
   systematic synthesis methodology that can meet these requirements in a
   deterministic fashion. In this paper; we demonstrate how existing body
   of knowledge in compliant mechanisms can be systematically leveraged to
   design spring geometries with distributed compliance that meet fatigue
   criteria and weight requirements. Towards this, we implement a
   strength-based approach to determine feasible initial solutions that
   upon optimization yield geometries with maximally distributed stresses.
   Such a framework is general and can be adapted for designing any
   compliant mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{To realize engineered materials and structures via origami methods and
   other folding construction techniques, fundamental understanding of
   paper folding mechanics and their dependency on paper
   micro/nano-structure is needed. Using selected papers commonly used in
   origami designs, we establish the relationship between the mechanical
   properties of fibrous paper and their corresponding ability to form and
   retain simple creases and mountain/valley folds. Using natural fiber
   paper (abaca), synthetic fiber paper (Tyvek), and a metal-fiber laminate
   paper, we studied how the fold radius depends on the load applied using
   a controlled rolling apparatus. After folding, we examined the resultant
   micro- and nanoscale deformation using electron microscopy. In general
   we found that the fold radius follows a power law, decreasing with the
   applied rolling force. At a critical strain, each paper exhibits a
   transition between elastic and plastic behavior, after which the trend
   asymptotically approaches the minimum fold radius with increased applied
   force. Finally, we present examples of centimeter-scale
   two-dimensionally ``mountain fold{''} patterns and relate the folding
   characteristics observed in these designs to the mechanical properties
   of the papers in folding.}},

Abstract = {{As the recent structures seek lighter weight, damping becomes a more
   critical issue. Decreasing weight increases flexibility causing
   vibrations to become more prevalent. Damping treatments to reduce
   unwanted vibrations are usually classified into three categories:
   passive, semi active and active depending on the degree to which
   external energy and complexity is needed to achieve the required
   reduction in vibration. Here we examine the use of a multifunctional
   structure's philosophy to introduce and research the concept of
   ``electronic damping{''} offering an alternative to traditional damping
   solutions and a capability of providing uniform energy dissipation
   across a wide range of ambient frequencies and temperatures. The
   proposed research addresses increasing the range of effectiveness of
   damping by addressing the temperature and frequency dependence of
   material damping by using a multifunctional composite system containing
   an active element. Our approach is to model the mechanics using
   Lagrange's formulation for multi-physics systems and to experimentally
   validate our models using careful experiments. We propose to examine the
   strength models and properties of the system and to examine the
   performance by constructing and testing some prototype systems. The
   focus is on both the electrical integration and the structural
   integration of the different material systems required to. design a
   completely stand alone multifunctional composite with superior damping
   properties useful for suppressing vibrations.}},

Abstract = {{Sensing falsification is a key security problem in cooperative spectrum
   sensing for cognitive radio networks. Most previous approaches assume
   that malicious users only cheat in their sensing reports following a
   predefined rule. However, some malicious users usually act intelligently
   to strategically adjust their malicious behavior according to their
   objectives and the network's defense schemes. The existing schemes
   cannot resist the malicious behaviors of intelligent malicious users
   (IMUs) without long-term collection of information on their reputation.
   In this paper, we construct a moral hazard principal-agent framework and
   design an incentive compatible mechanism to thwart the malicious
   behaviors of rational and irrational IMUs. We find that neither spectrum
   sensing nor spectrum access alone can prevent the malicious behavior
   without any information on users' reputation. According to the analysis
   of malicious behavior resistance methods, we propose a joint spectrum
   sensing and access mechanism to optimally prevent the IMUs from sensing
   falsification. Our evaluation results show that the proposed mechanism
   achieves almost the same performance as the ideal case with perfect
   sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, carrying control signals on passing data packets has emerged
   as a promising direction for efficient control information transmission.
   With control messages carried on data payload, the extra air time needed
   for control packets like RTS/CTS is eliminated and thus channel
   utilization is improved. However, carrying control signals on the data
   payload of a packet requires the data packet to have a sufficiently
   large SNR, otherwise both the data packet and the control messages are
   lost. In this paper, we propose Hitchhike, a technique that utilizes the
   preamble field to carry control messages. Hitchhike completely decouples
   the control messages from the payload and therefore the superposition of
   (multiple) control messages has little adverse effect on the operation

Abstract = {{This research evaluates simulated walking micro-robots based on
   orthogonal lateral and vertical actuators, a common restriction on
   micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) actuation, and subject to small
   damping effects and certain small-scale external forces operating on
   robot feet. Dimensional analysis is used to identify scalable trends in
   a numerical simulation of a simple walking dynamics model in which
   lateral and vertical motion are treated as dynamically-uncoupled, the
   limiting case for orthogonal MEMS actuators. The results of this
   analysis are that the system damping significantly affects walking
   speed, while small-scale foot-ground interaction forces other than
   adhesion have significant effects only over large order-of-magnitude
   variation in robot size. Results are intended to serve as a design tool

Abstract = {{This paper presents a micro XY stage that employs electrostatic
   comb-drive actuators and achieves a bi-directional displacement range
   greater than 225 gm per motion axis. The proposed XY stage design
   comprises four rigid stages (ground, motion stage, and two intermediate
   stages) interconnected via flexure modules. The motion stage, which has
   two translational degrees of freedom, is connected to two independent
   single degree of freedom intermediate stages via respective
   parallelogram (P) transmission flexures. The intermediate stages are
   connected to the ground via respective Clamped paired Double
   Parallelogram (C-DP-DP) guidance flexures. The C-DP-DP flexure, unlike
   conventional flexures such as the paired Double Parallelogram flexure
   (DP-DP), provides high bearing direction stiffness (K-b) while
   maintaining low motion direction stiffness (K-m) over a large range of
   motion direction displacement. This helps delay the onset of sideways
   instability in the comb-drive actuators that are integrated with the
   intermediate stages, thereby offering significantly greater actuation
   stroke compared to existing designs. The presented work includes
   closed-form stiffness analysis of the proposed micro XY stage, finite
   elements simulation, and experimental measurements of its static and
   dynamic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid systems often appear as models of mechatronic devices, and are
   used to express the discontinuous transition in dynamics that occurs
   when mechanical contacts are made or broken. Contact state changes can
   coincide with dramatic shifts in control authority, and become sources
   of unwanted disturbance when they are exogenously driven. In the natural
   world, such systems appear in rapid legged locomotion. We present an
   insight derived from the analysis of running animals -namely that
   dynamics can be partially or fully controlled through geometric encoding
   of the desired control law in the feed-forward trajectories of the
   appendages. The resulting systems use no sensing, or nearly so, yet can
   exhibit strong (deadbeat) stability. We provide a theoretical proof of a
   general result, then a simulation study of a simplified model of
   vertical hopping which rejects ground-height changes without sensing the
   ground. We thereby show that mechatronic controllers for non-trivial
   tasks such as manipulation and legged locomotion could be implemented
   mechanically, with little or no sensing, by encoding the control laws in
   the open-loop motions chosen. Our results highlight that identification
   of a control mechanism in an existing animal or machine must take into
   account that such geometric stabilization may exist without neural or
   computational feedback.}},

Abstract = {{When traversing sharp corners, manufacturing machines are forced to
   tradeoff speed and accuracy The most common way of reducing this
   tradeoff is to smooth the sharp corner using a pre-specified curve
   (e.g., a circular arc or spline). However, pre-specified curves cannot
   guarantee optimal performance. This paper presents a preliminary
   investigation into the potential of using methods from optimal control
   to minimize this tradeoff First, a useful simplification is made to the
   exact cornering problem to make it tractable. Dynamic programming is
   then used to determine the best free-form curve that minimizes corner
   traversal time while adhering to path tolerance and machine kinematic
   constraints. Significant improvements in cornering time are demonstrated
   compared to two methods that use pre-specified curves. However, dynamic
   programming is found to be too computationally costly, thus impractical.
   Less computationally intensive techniques in optimal control are
   considered for future work.}},

Abstract = {{Typical drivers are not ready to react to unexpected collisions from
   other vehicles. The initial impact can startle the driver who then fails
   to maintain control. Since a loss of control leads to intense skidding
   and undesirable lateral motions, more severe subsequent events are
   likely to occur. To reduce the severity of possible subsequent
   (secondary) crashes, this paper considers both vehicle heading angle and
   lateral deviation from the original driving path. The research concept
   here is different from today's electronic stability control systems in
   that it activates the differential braking even when the magnitude of
   yaw rate or vehicle slip angle is very high. In addition, the lateral
   displacement and yaw angle with respect to the road are part of the
   control objective. The Linear Time Varying Model Predictive Control
   (LTV-MPC) method is used, with the key tire nonlinearities captured
   through linearization. We consider tire force constraints based on the
   combined-slip tire model and their dependence on vehicle motion. The
   computed high-level (virtual) control signals are realized through a
   control allocation problem which maps vehicle motion commands to tire
   braking forces considering constraints. Numerical simulation and
   analysis results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   control algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a method to estimate battery state of health (SoH)
   via health-relevant electrochemical features. Battery state of health
   estimation is a critical part of battery management because it allows
   for balancing the trade-off between maximizing performance and
   minimizing degradation. In this paper, a health-relevant electrochemical
   feature, the side reaction current density, is used as the indicator of
   battery SoH. An estimation algorithm is required due to the
   unavailability of the side reaction current density via noninvasive
   methods. In this paper, Retrospective-Cost Subsystem Identification
   (RCSI) is used to estimate the side reaction current density via
   identification of an unknown battery health subsystem that generates the
   side reaction current density. Simulation results are provided for
   constant current charge and discharge cycles with different C rates. A
   current profile for an electric vehicle (EV) going through Urban
   Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycles is also used as the
   excitation signal during estimation. The simulations show promising
   results in battery health dynamic identification and side reaction
   current density estimation with RCSI.}},

Abstract = {{Electrohydrodynamic jet (e-jet) printing is a recent micro-manufacturing
   technique that uses electrostatic force to draw out ink from a
   conductive nozzle onto a conductive substrate. While the advantages
   (high speed and resolution, flexibility) of e-jet printing over ink jet
   printing and other microfabrication methods are abundant, precise
   control of the process is necessary for successful commercialization of
   the technology. This paper shows how visual feedback through image
   processing may be used to regulate the volume of printed droplets for
   increased manufacturing precision.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we establish a mathematical framework that allows us to
   optimize the speed profile and select the optimal gears for heavy-duty
   vehicles. The key idea is to solve the analogous boundary value problem
   analytically for a simple scenario (linear damped system with quadratic
   elevation profile) and use this result to initialize a numerical
   continuation algorithm. Then the numerical algorithm can be used to
   gradually introduce non-linearities (air resistance, engine saturation),
   implement data-based elevation profiles, and incorporate external
   perturbations (wind, traffic). This approach enables real-time
   optimization in dynamic traffic conditions, therefore may be implemented
   on board.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of an autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that is at
   least the size of a passenger vehicle are critical to consider during
   obstacle avoidance maneuvers to ensure vehicle safety. Methods developed
   so far do not take vehicle dynamics and sensor limitations into account
   simultaneously and systematically to guarantee the vehicle's dynamical
   safety during avoidance maneuvers. To address this gap, this paper
   presents a model predictive control (MPC) based obstacle avoidance
   algorithm for high-speed, large-size UGVs that perceives the environment
   only through the information provided by a sensor, takes into account
   the sensing and control delays and the dynamic limitations of the
   vehicle, and provides smooth and continuous optimal solutions in terms
   of minimizing travel time. Specifically, information about the
   environment is obtained using an on-board Light Detection and Ranging
   (LIDAR) sensor. Ensuring the vehicle's dynamical safety is translated
   into avoiding single tire lift-off The obstacle avoidance problem is
   formulated as a multi-stage optimal control problem with a unique
   optimal solution. To solve the optimal control problem, it is
   transcribed into a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem using a
   pseudo-spectral method, and solved using the interior-point method.
   Sensing and control delays are explicitly taken into consideration in
   the formulation. Simulation results show that the algorithm is capable
   of generating smooth control commands to avoid obstacles while
   guaranteeing dynamical safety.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature distribution in a prismatic Li-ion battery cell can be
   described using a spatially distributed equivalent circuit electrical
   model coupled to a 3D thermal model. The model represents a middle
   ground between simple one or two state models (generally used for
   cylindrical cells) and complex finite element models. A lumped parameter
   approach for the thermal properties of the lithium-ion jelly roll is
   used. The battery is divided into (m x n) nodes in 2-dimensions, and
   each node is represented by an equivalent circuit and 3 temperatures in
   the through plane direction to capture the electrical and thermal
   dynamics respectively. The thermal model is coupled to the electrical
   through heat generation. The parameters of the equivalent circuit
   electrical model are temperature and state of charge dependent.
   Parameterization of the distributed resistances in the equivalent
   circuit model is demonstrated using lumped parameter measurements, and
   are a function of local temperature. The model is parameterized and
   validated with data collected from a 3-cell fixture which replicates
   pack cooling conditions. Pulsing current experiments are used for
   validation over a wide range of operating conditions (ambient
   temperature, state of charge, current amplitude and pulse width). The
   model is shown to match experimental results with good accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-precision manufacturing (UPM) machines are used to fabricate and
   measure complex parts having micrometer-level features and

   residual vibrations that occur during the motion of the machines' axes
   must be minimized. Recent work by the authors has revealed that coupling
   vibration modes of passively-isolated UPM machines can provide
   conditions for drastic reduction of residual vibrations vis-a-vis the
   recommended practice of modal decoupling. This paper presents an
   investigation into the effects of non-proportional (NP) damping on the
   conclusions reached in the authors' prior work With NP damping added,
   the conditions under which mode coupling is beneficial relative to
   decoupling are seen to remain largely the same. However, NP damping is
   shown to significantly influence the conditions under which the system's
   response is most sensitive to mode coupling. Design guidelines for
   maximally exploiting the benefits of mode coupling are presented and

Abstract = {{Small unmanned ground vehicles risk rollover at high speeds. This paper
   proposes use of a manipulator arm on the robot in a dynamic

   control law for dynamic weight-shifting of the manipulator arm is
   proposed. A linear dynamic model is used to analyze the effect of the
   arm design (link length, mass, etc.) on the roll dynamics, and a more
   complex nonlinear simulation in Simulink SimMechanics is used to
   evaluate roll reduction for various steering angles and velocities.
   Simulations given the same steering input with dynamic weight-shifting
   showed a roll reduction factor of 12\%. For the same radius turn, a roll
   reduction factor of 29\% was observed. A 50\% reduction in steering
   angle was used to achieve a similar turning radius with dynamic
   weight-shifting activated. By increasing rollover stability, dynamic
   weight-shifting has the potential to increase safe operating speeds for

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to reduce surface variation in face milling
   processes based on high-definition metrology (HDM) measurements. Our
   previous research has found and established the relations between
   surface variation patterns, cutting forces, and process variables. The
   findings revealed that varying feed rate and proper cutter path planning
   are the most feasible and cost-effective approaches for reducing
   variation along the feed direction. This paper explores the HDM data
   pattern that reflects surface tilting along the circumferential
   direction induced by cutter-spindle deflection. It is found that such a
   tilt is caused by the cutting load imbalance between the two sides of
   the cutter path. Cutting force modeling is then conducted to estimate
   such cutting load imbalance. Based on the model, a cutter load balancing
   algorithm is developed to reduce surface variations by adjusting cutter
   path and/or feed rate. A case study based on a cutting experiment is
   conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the
   surface flatness by 25\%.}},

Abstract = {{Making concurrent decisions on assembly plans and supply chain
   configurations is a desirable strategy in today's competitive global
   market. Such concurrent decisions help reduce decision iterations for
   shortened lead time, and lower the total cost for manufacturers and
   their supply chains. However, there lacks deep understanding of the
   interaction of assembly plans and supply chain configurations, as well
   as methodologies for integrating them. In this paper, we consider the
   problem of simultaneously decomposing an assembly product to modules and
   assigning the modules to suppliers. The joint decision is formulated as
   an optimization problem of finding the assembly decomposition and the
   corresponding supply chain network with the lowest total supply chain
   cost. We develop a coordinated decision making method by integrating
   assembly AND/OR graphs with supply chain cost information. A Dynamic
   Programming (DP) based algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the
   combined optimization problem. Case studies demonstrate that the
   proposed method can find optimal solutions to the integrated decision
   making problem efficiently and provide a tool to plan assemblies from
   the perspective of the total supply chain cost in the early stages of
   product development.}},

   positioning commands in computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines.
   A model of the machine's dynamics is used to predict the servo error

   information, the reference path is extended by an amount calculated to
   ensure that the predicted error falls within a user-specified threshold
   in the shortest possible time. The proposed method is shown in
   simulations to significantly shorten rapid positioning time compared to
   the industry-standard approach of compensating for servo delays by
   pausing motion until servo errors fall within user-specified thresholds.

Abstract = {{The ease of entering a car is one of the important ergonomic factors
   that car manufacturers consider during the process of car design. This
   has motivated many researchers to investigate factors that affect
   discomfort during ingress. The patterns of motion during ingress may be
   related to discomfort, but the analysis of motion is challenging. In
   this paper, a modeling framework is proposed to use the motions of body
   landmarks to predict subjectively reported discomfort during ingress.
   Foot trajectories are used to identify a set of trials with a consistent
   right-leg-first strategy. The trajectories from 20 landmarks on the
   limbs and torso are parameterized using B-spline basis functions. Two
   group selection methods, group nonnegative garrote (GNNG) and stepwise
   group selection (SGS), are used to filter and identify the trajectories
   that are important for prediction. Finally, a classification and
   prediction model is built using support vector machine (SVM). The
   performance of the proposed framework is then evaluated against simpler,
   more common prediction models.}},

Abstract = {{For conventional metal forming, finite element (FE) method becomes a
   powerful tool in process design. However, conventional material models
   cannot describe material behaviors precisely in micro/meso scale due to
   the size/scale effects. As a result, know-how obtained in traditional
   macro-forming is not suitable for the micro-forming process. In
   micro/meso scale forming process, the reaction force, localized stress
   concentration and formability are not only dependent on the strain
   distribution and strain path but also the strain gradient and strain
   gradient path caused by decreased scale.
   This study presented a model based on conventional mechanism based
   strain gradient (CMSG) plasticity. A user-defined material (UMAT)
   subroutine incorporating the CMSG plasticity in the ABAQUS finite
   element (FE) program was established. Based on the subroutine, FE
   simulations were performed to analyze the effects of the channel width
   in sheet forming process of micro-channel features. Die sets were
   fabricated according to the scale law and Micro/meso scale sheet forming
   experiments were conducted to study the effect of channel width in the
   die. Experimental results indicated that the CMSG plastic theory
   achieved better agreements compared to the conventional plastic theory.
   It found that the influence of the strain gradient to the forming
   process increased with the decrease of the geometrical parameters of the
   tools. Furthermore, various tool geometrical parameters were designed by
   Taguchi Method to explore the feature size effects caused by the
   decrease of tool geometrical dimensions. According the scale law,
   similarity difference and the similarity accuracy were calculated to
   evaluate the size effects. Greater equivalent strain gradient was found
   with the decrease of the tool geometric dimension, which lead larger
   maximum reaction force error due to increasing size effects. The main
   effect plots for equivalent strain gradient and reaction force indicated
   that the influence of the tools clearance was larger than punch radius,
   die radius and die width.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely observed that today's engineering products demand
   increasingly strict tolerances. The shape of a machined surface plays a
   critical role to the desired functionality of a product. Even a small
   error can be the difference between a successful product launch and a
   major delay. Thus, it is important to develop measurement tools to
   ensure the quality and accuracy of products' machined surfaces. The key
   to assessing the quality is robust measurement and inspection techniques
   combined with advanced analysis. However, conventional Geometrical
   Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD\&T) such as flatness falls short of
   characterizing the surface shape. With the advancements in metrology
   methodology utilizing digital holographic interferometry, large amount
   of surface data can be captured at high resolution and accuracy without
   changing platform or technique. This captured High Definition Data (HDD)
   enables the mining of more valuable information from machined surfaces
   that most current industry practice cannot achieve in a timely manner.
   Such new metrology system opens the torrent of observable events at
   plant floor and increases the transparency of machining processes. This
   presents great opportunities to characterize machined surface into a new
   level of details, which can be applied in production quality evaluation
   and process condition monitoring and control. This research work
   proposes a framework of a multi-scale surface characterization for
   surface quality evaluation and process monitoring. Case studies are
   presented to show how proposed metrics could be applied in surface
   quality evaluation and process monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) is a non-conventional
   micromachining technology, and is highlighted for non-conductive brittle
   materials. However, the outcomes of ECDM have many restrictions in
   application due to limitations on efficiency, accuracy, and machining
   quality. In this paper, a drilling incorporated ECDM process is
   presented and analyzed to enhance material removal rate in ECDM drilling
   process. Incorporating micro-drilling into ECDM significantly increases
   the rate of material removal, especially in deep hole drilling. As
   fundamentals of the machining process, material removal mechanisms have
   been investigated to account for the increment in material removal rate
   by incorporating microdrilling. Vibration of tool electrode, induced by
   a piezoactuator, was introduced to further enhance material removal
   rate. Quantitative studies were conducted to determine the appropriate
   process parameters of drilling incorporated ECDM with tool vibration.}},

Abstract = {{Online process monitoring in ultrasonic welding of automotive
   lithium-ion batteries is essential for robust and reliable battery pack
   assembly. Effective quality monitoring algorithms have been developed to
   identify out of control parts by applying purely statistical
   classification methods. However, such methods do not provide the deep
   physical understanding of the manufacturing process that is necessary to
   provide diagnostic capability when the process is out of control. The
   purpose of this study is to determine the physical correlation between
   ultrasonic welding signal features and the ultrasonic welding process
   conditions and ultimately joint performance. A deep understanding in
   these relationships will enable a significant reduction in production
   launch time and cost, improve process design for ultrasonic welding, and
   reduce operational downtime through advanced diagnostic methods. In this
   study, the fundamental physics behind the ultrasonic welding process is
   investigated using two process signals, weld power and horn
   displacement. Several online features are identified by examining those
   signals and their variations under abnormal process conditions. The
   joint quality is predicted by correlating such online features to weld
   attributes such as bond density and post-weld thickness that directly
   impact the weld performance. This study provides a guideline for feature
   selection and advanced diagnostics to achieve a reliable online quality
   monitoring system in ultrasonic metal welding.}},

Abstract = {{This study advances design and manufacturing of the tip geometry of the
   Kirschner wire (K-wire) a popular orthopedic drilling tool with a sharp,
   three-sided trocar point for improved bone drilling efficiency. Since
   there is no active cutting edge as there is for twist drill bits, bone
   drilling forces can be so large as to cause excessive heat generation
   and tool wear. Our modified K-wire consists of three slots at the tip to
   enhance cutting and chip (bone debris) evacuation. A finite element
   model was developed to simulate bone debris generation, thus predicting
   the improvement by the slot design. An experimental study was conducted
   to validate the model and ascertain actual drilling performance. During
   5 mm drilling the maximum thrust force and torque were both reduced on
   average by 30-40\% based on the experimental data. The overall trends of
   both force and torque agree with the model-predicted results.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse representation of signals and images using an over-complete basis
   function (dictionary) has attracted a lot of attention in the literature
   recently. Atoms of a dictionary are either chosen from a predefined set
   of functions (e.g. Sine, Cosine or Wavelets), or learned from a training
   set (KSVD). Recently, a nonlinear (NL) dictionary has been proposed by
   adding NL functions, such as polynomials, rational, logarithmic,
   exponential, and phase shifted and higher order cosine functions to the
   conventional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) atoms. In this paper, we
   present a comprehensive performance comparison of various NL functions
   that are added to the DCT dictionary. The NL dictionary is also compared
   with the other known dictionaries such as DCT, Haar and KSVD-based
   learned dictionary for sparse image reconstruction. In the second part,
   the NL dictionary is exploited for sparsity based image denoising.
   Retinal images are used for the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Subspace clustering is a useful tool for analyzing large complex data,
   but in many relevant applications missing data are common. Existing
   theoretical analysis of this problem shows that subspace clustering from
   incomplete data is possible, but that analysis requires the number of
   samples (i.e., partially observed vectors) to be super-polynomial in the
   dimension d. Such huge sample sizes are unnecessary when no data are
   missing and uncommon in applications. There are two main contributions
   in this paper. First, it is shown that if subspaces have rank at most r
   and the number of partially observed vectors greater than d(r+1) (times
   a poly-logarithmic factor), then with high probability the true
   subspaces are the only subspaces that agree with the observed data. We
   may conclude that subspace clustering may be possible without
   impractically large sample sizes and that we can certify the output of
   any subspace clustering algorithm by checking its fit to the observed
   data. The second main contribution is a novel EM-type algorithm for
   subspace clustering with missing data. We demonstrate and compare it to
   several other algorithms. Experiments with simulated and real data show
   that such algorithms work well in practice.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of wireless sensing technology by the structural health
   monitoring community has shown advantages over traditional cable-based
   systems, such as convenient sensor installation and lower system cost in
   many applications. Recently, a new generation of wireless sensing
   platform, named Martlet, has been collaboratively developed by
   researchers at the University of Michigan, Georgia Tech, and Michigan
   Tech. Martlet adopts a Texas Instruments Piccolo microcontroller running
   up to 90 MHz clock frequency, which enables Martlet to support
   high-frequency data acquisition and high-speed onboard computation. The
   extensible design of the Martlet printed circuit boards allows
   convenient incorporation of various sensor boards. In order to obtain
   accurate acceleration data and meanwhile reduce the sensor cost, a new
   Martlet sensor board, named integrated accelerometer wing, is developed.
   The integrated accelerometer wing adopts a commercial-off-the-shelf MEMS
   (microelectromechanical systems) accelerometer and contains an onboard
   signal conditioner performing three basic functions, including mean
   shifting, anti-aliasing filtering and signal amplification. One distinct
   feature of the signal conditioner is the on-the-fly programmable cut-off
   frequency and amplification gain factor. To validate the performance of
   Martlet and the integrated accelerometer wing, experiments are carried
   out on a laboratory four-story aluminum shear-frame structure. The
   laboratory experiment results demonstrate that the performance of the
   wireless sensing system is comparable to that of cabled reference
   sensors. In addition, using data collected by wireless sensors,
   vibration modal properties of the structure are identified and finite
   element (FE) model updating is performed.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing conductivity changes to locate matrix damage in glass fiber
   reinforced polymers (GFRPs) manufactured with nanocomposite matrices is
   a promising avenue of composite structural health monitoring (SHIM) with
   the potential to ensure unprecedented levels of safety. Nanocomposites
   depend on the formation of well-connected nanofiller networks for
   electrical conductivity. Therefore, matrix damage that severs the
   connection between nanofillers will manifest as a local change in
   conductivity. This research advances state of the art conductivity-based
   SHM by employing electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to locate
   damage-induced conductivity changes in a glass fiber/epoxy laminate
   manufactured with carbon black (CB) filler. EIT for damage detection is
   characterized by identifying the lower threshold of throughhole
   detection and demonstrating the capability of EIT to accurately resolve
   multiple through holes. It is found that through holes as small as 3.18
   mm in diameter can be detected, and EIT can detect multiple through
   holes. However, sensitivity to new through holes is diminished in the
   presence of existing through holes unless a damaged baseline is used.
   These research findings demonstrate the considerable potential of
   conductivity-based health monitoring for GFRP laminates with conductive
   networks of nanoparticles in the matrix.}},

Abstract = {{We present an MRI-compatible vibration energy harvester for powering
   implantable medical devices with heartbeat induced vibrations. The state
   of the art heartbeat-powered energy harvesters are magnetically
   bi-stable, rendering this devices MR' incompatible. A type of nonlinear
   harvester exhibiting purely elastic multi-stability based on bi-stable
   composite laminates is herein proposed for this purpose. The purely
   elastic nature of the exhibited bi-stability is crucial for powering
   medical devices as magnetic based multi-stable harvesters are not
   suitable for implantation. The energy harvester structure based on
   cantilevered bi-stable laminates used in this paper is inherently
   nonlinear and is thus MRI compatible. Harmonic frequency sweeps and
   previously measured signals simulating vibrations produced around the
   chest area of the human heart are used as vibration inputs to the
   harvesting device for experimental tests. The results show the
   capability of harvesting sufficient energy for powering conventional
   pacemakers with the exact vibration inputs expected during in vivo

Abstract = {{Results are reported from an ongoing experimental investigation of the
   effects of thermo-oxidative aging on the mechanical behavior of an epoxy
   shape memory polymer (SMP). Chemo-rheological degradation due to
   macromolecular scission and cross-linking is one of the main factors
   contributing to the chemical aging of thermo-responsive SMPs. This aging
   may manifest as residual strain or irreversible material property
   changes, which can affect the performance and limit the useful life of a
   SMP. A relatively new epoxy SMP based on the diglycidyl ether of
   bisphenol A is synthesized, and specimens are tested under uniaxial
   tension using a dynamic mechanical analyzer. Fundamental viscoelastic
   behavior and thermal expansion coefficients are first characterized,
   showing a glass transition near 60 degrees C. Shape memory cycle
   experiments are performed at shape fixing temperatures of 80, 125, 150
   and 175 degrees C, and the effect of fixing time at each temperature is
   examined upon subsequent strain recovery at 80 degrees C. Performance
   parameters such as recovery ratio, speed of recovery and residual strain
   are quantified as a function of shape fixing time and temperature. No
   effect of chemical aging was seen at a fixing temperature of 80 degrees
   C, although the recovery ratio decreases initially with increasing
   fixing time and stabilizes near 92 \%. Only minor effects of chemical
   aging are seen in the mechanical responses for fixing temperatures of
   125 and 150 degrees C, but specimens exhibit progressively more
   noticeable color changes that indicate oxidation. Significant effects
   are observed at the highest fixing temperature of 175 degrees C, where
   chemical aging at longer fixing times results in a reduction in recovery
   rate across the rubber-glass transition temperature, progressively
   larger residual strains, lack of complete strain recovery at 80 degrees
   C, and higher temperatures to achieve 90 \% strain recovery.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates the rectilinear locomotion of a
   meta-structural robot inspired by the earthworm. First of all, an
   equivalent multi-segment model of the meta-structural locomotion robot
   is derived. By the method of averaging, the robot's average steady-state
   velocity is obtained, which is a function of the phase differences among
   segments. Then a novel locomotion control scheme of adjusting actuation
   phases is proposed for the robot. It is shown that such control of the
   phase differences among actuators can significantly tailor not only the
   magnitude but also the direction of the robot's average steady-state
   velocity. Locomotion tests with equal phase difference among segments
   are carried out on the robot prototype in a horizontal pipe. The
   predicted phase-velocity relationship is verified, and it is shown that
   the proposed control is more effective than the more traditional
   peristaltic locomotion gaits. The presented earthworm-like robot belongs
   to the general class of rnetastructures, the concept of synthesizing
   adaptive structures via modular element design and integration. This
   study lays the foundation for understanding and advancing the properties
   of such meta-structural locomotion robots.}},

Abstract = {{It has recently been shown that negligible linear stiffness or very
   small negative stiffness may be the most beneficial stiffness
   nonlinearities for vibrational energy harvesters due to the broadband,
   amplified responses which result from such designs. These stiffness
   characteristics are often achieved by providing axial compression along
   the length of a harvester beam. Axial compressive forces induced using
   magnetic or electrostatic effects are often easily tuned; however,
   electrostatic energy harvesters are practically limited to microscale
   realizations and magnets are not amenable in a variety of applications,
   e.g. self-powered biomedical implants or when the harvesters are
   packaged with particular circuits. On the other hand,
   mechanically-induced pre-compression methods considered to date are less
   able to achieve fine control of the applied force which is typically
   governed by a pre-compression distance that has practical constraints
   such as resolution and tolerance. This notably limits the harvester's
   ability to precisely obtain the desired near-zero or small negative
   linear stiffness and thus inhibits the favorable dynamical phenomena
   that lead to high energy conversion performance. Inspired by the wing
   motor structure of the common diptera (fly), this research explores an
   alternative energy harvester design and configuration that considerably
   improves control over precompression factors and their influence upon
   performanceimproving dynamics A pre-compressed harvester beam having an
   axial suspension on an end is investigated through theoretical and
   numerical studies and experimental efforts. Suspension and pre-loading
   adjustments are found to enable comprehensive variation over the
   resulting dynamics. It is shown that the incorporation of adjustable
   axial suspension into the design of pre-compressed energy harvester
   beams is therefore a versatile, all-mechanical means to enhance the
   performance of such devices and ensure favorable dynamics are retained
   across a wide range of excitation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In applications of vibration energy harvesting to embedded wireless
   sensing, the available power and energy can be very low This poses
   interesting challenges for technological feasibility if the parasitic
   losses in the electronics used to harvest this energy are prohibitive.
   In this study, we present a theory for the active control of power
   generation in energy harvesters in a manner which addresses and
   compensates for parasitic loss. We conduct the analysis in the context
   of a single-transducer piezoelectric bimorph cantilever beam subjected
   to a low-frequency impulse train. The power generation of the vibration
   energy harvester is maximized while considering mechanical losses,
   electrical losses, and the static power required to activate control
   intelligence and facilitate power-electronic conversion. It is shown
   that the optimal harvesting current can be determined through the use of
   linear quadratic optimal control techniques. The optimal harvesting time
   over which energy should be generated, following an impulse, is
   determined concurrently with the optimal feedback law We show that this
   optimal harvesting time exhibits bifurcations as a function of the
   parameters characterizing the losses in the system.}},

Abstract = {{Although the tensile behavior of shape memory alloys (SMAs) is
   relatively well understood, the effects of other modes of loading on SMA
   behavior are still unknown. To examine the influence of loading and
   specimen geometry on structural behavior and phase transformation
   morphology, this work presents an experimental characterization of
   commercially-available superelastic NiTi rods and tubes under tensile,
   compressive, pure bending and column buckling loading. At room
   temperature and under isothermal loading conditions, the mechanical
   response for each loading configuration and structural geometry is
   measured and stereo digital image correlation is used to capture local
   displacement and strain phenomena (such as strain localization and
   propagating phase boundaries).
   It is found that the length and cross-sectional geometry of NiTi
   structures affects the nature of stress-induced phase transformation; in
   particular, transformation induced strain localization. During uniaxial
   tension, the rod specimens exhibit strain localization and propagating
   phase transformation fronts along well-defined load plateaus, and phase
   boundaries manifest as diffuse propagating necks. The tube specimens
   also exhibit localization/propagation phenomena, but fronts consist of
   distinct angled finger-like features due to the relatively thin-walled
   cross-section. During uniaxial compression, both forms exhibit (now
   well-known) tension-compression asymmetry in their mechanical responses,
   no propagating fronts are observed, and distinct load plateaus are
   absent. During pure bending, the moment-curvature responses of both
   forms exhibit plateaus during localizing forward and reverse
   transformations. In the case of the rod, high curvature localizes and
   propagates along the specimen; whereas, finger-like high strain regions
   develop along the tensile side of the tube. During column buckling, the
   structures are loaded into the post-buckling regime yet recover their
   straight forms upon unloading. Localization is observed, but only for
   high length/diameter aspect ratio tubes and has little affect on the
   mechanical response. Therefore, due to the varying phase transformation
   behaviors observed, understanding geometric and material effects on
   phase transformation, along with the resulting effects on the material
   response, is necessary to predict SMA beam behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Combining adaptable supporting structure, large compliance, and
   intricate energy management, skeletal muscle is a natural system that
   exhibits numerous attractive characteristics. Recent mechanical modeling
   of muscle suggests some of the intriguing macroscale features are due to
   the assembly of nanoscale, metastable cross-bridge constituents.
   Inspired by the multifunctionality and versatility of muscle's
   architectural composition, this research investigates a new paradigm of
   modular structure-material development to achieve significant system
   adaptivity by utilizing building blocks possessing metastability. The
   proposed, assembled systems belong to the class of metastructures, a new
   concept for engineering adaptive structures from basic, functional units
   in ways such that the systems exhibit unprecedented characteristics
   resulting from a synergy of their elements. A modular and metastable
   building block is created to emulate the effective passive functionality
   of muscle's cross-bridge. Analytical and experimental results reveal
   that metastructures assembled from the metastable modules may supply
   unique changes in reaction force when the end displacement is
   prescribed, adapting not only the magnitude of force but also the
   direction, in addition to yielding a multitude of globally stable
   topologies. The investigations provide clear evidence that a
   metastructure may realize orders of magnitude change in stiffness for a
   constant system shape, and also enables the variation in required energy
   expense to globally deform the system. From these findings, the
   metastructural design framework represents a major leap forward in
   adaptive structures and material systems and has the potential to find
   broad future application.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) are powered by a large number of battery cells,
   requiring an effective battery management system (BMS) to maintain the
   battery cells in an operational condition while providing the necessary
   power efficiently. Temperature is one of the most important factors for
   battery operation, and existing BMSes have thus employed simple thermal
   management policies so as to prevent battery cells from very high and
   low temperatures which may likely cause their explosion and malfunction,
   respectively. In this paper, we study thermo-physical characteristics of
   battery cells, and design a battery thermal management system that
   achieves efficiency and reliability by active thermal controls.
   We first analyze the effect of a temperature change on the basic
   operation of a battery cell. We then show how it can cause thermal and
   general problems, e.g., a thermal runaway that results in explosion of
   battery cells, and unbalanced state of charge (SoC) that degrades
   battery cells' performance. Based on this understanding of thermal
   behavior, we finally develop temperaturecontrol approaches which are
   then used to design a battery thermal management system. Our simulation
   results demonstrate that the proposed thermal management system improves
   battery performance by up to 58.4\% without compromising reliability
   over the existing simple thermal management.}},

Abstract = {{Models for ignition delay in a direct injection compression ignition
   engine are investigated and fuel specific properties are included to
   predict the effects of different fuels on the ignition delay. These
   models follow the Arrhenius type expression for the ignition delay
   modified with the oxygen concentration and Cetane number to extend the
   range of validity. In this investigation two fuel-sensitive spray
   ignition delay models are developed: a global model and a local model.
   The global model is based on the global combustion chamber charge
   properties including temperature, pressure and oxygen/fuel content. The
   local model is developed to account for temporal and spatial variations
   in properties of separated spray zones such as local temperature,
   oxidizer and fuel concentrations obtained by a quasi-dimensional
   multi-zone fuel spray model. These variations are integrated in time to
   predict the ignition delay. An ignition delay model is typically
   re-calibrated for a specific fuel being used. In this study, the global
   ignition delay model includes the Cetane number to capture ignition
   delay of various fuels. The local model uses Cetane number and local
   stoichiometric oxygen to fuel molar ratio. Due to those variables, the
   model is capable of predicting spray ignition delays for a set of fuels
   with a single calibration step. Experimental dataset of spray ignition
   delay in a constant volume chamber is used for model development and
   calibration. The models show a good accuracy for the predicted ignition
   delay of four different fuels: JP8, DF2, n-heptane and n-dodecane. The
   investigation revealed that the most accurate form of the models is from
   a calibration done for each individual fuel with only a slight decrease
   in accuracy when a single calibration is done for all fuels. The single
   calibration case is the more desirable outcome as it leads to general
   models that cover all the fuels. Of the two proposed models the local
   model has a slightly better accuracy compared to the global model.
   Results for both models demonstrate the improvements that can be
   obtained for the ignition delay model when additional fuel specific
   properties are included in the spray ignition model.
   Other alternative fuels like synthetic oxygenated fuels were included in
   the investigation. These fuels behave differently such that the Cetane
   number does not provide the same explanation for the trend in ignition
   delay. Though of lower accuracy, the new models do improve the
   predictive capability when compared with existing types of ignition
   delay models applied to this kind of fuels.}},

Abstract = {{A new valve-only micropump structure for gas applications is proposed
   consisting of electrostatically actuated checkerboard microvalves with
   dual cavities. The valve-only multistage peristaltic design minimizes
   complexity and footprint of the device, which allows operation at high
   frequency, better sealing and efficient operation. A previously
   developed reduced order model is used to design and analyze the
   performance of the system. In this paper the effect of the cavity height
   on the performance and stability of this system is explored. The
   fabricated micropump produced a flow rate of 140 mu l/min at 1 kHz
   operation despite the cavity and membrane resonance being > 20 kHz. Four
   micropumps having cavity heights of 45, 60, 90 and 120 gm are explored
   in the modeling efforts using sinusoidal waveforms. It is found that an
   optimum cavity height exists which maximizes pump performance.
   Decreasing the cavity height below this value increases acoustic
   pressure damping, which in turn increases instability of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the spreading
   behavior of a nanosized water droplet that contains freely moving ions
   subject to an imposed electric field parallel to a solid surface.
   Results show that positive and negative ions respond to the applied
   electric field in a different manner, whereas water molecules are
   polarized by realigning themselves in the electric field. These
   localized behaviors of the ions and polarized molecules define the
   droplet deformation and spreading on a solid substrate. Both the ion
   concentration and the strength of the applied field play an important
   role in re-alignment of the polarized water molecules and in the
   movement of ions. The existence of the freely moving ions causes the
   droplet to spread differently from the pure liquid. It is observed that
   an ionically conducting water droplet undergoes the
   asymmetric-to-symmetric spreading transition at about the field strength
   of 0.05V/angstrom, which is considerably smaller than the same sized
   water droplet without ions. Also, the ionically conducting droplet
   completely wets the solid surface in the presence of a strong electric
   field.}},

Abstract = {{Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) patterning provides an alternative to
   fabricate the controllable polymeric micro/nanostructures, which have
   wide applications in industry. Both steady state and dynamic development
   of EHD patterning structures are discussed in this paper. For the steady
   state modeling, a discontinuous boundary element coupled with finite
   element method is applied. Numerical results reveal that a critical
   voltage exists, below which a small amplitude structure is obtained and
   above which polymer evolves into patterns with a large height/width
   ratio. The transient process of EHD patterning is represented by the
   numerical solution of the phase field equation coupled with the electric
   field and Navier-Stokes equation. The computer model is capable of
   describing the dynamic development of the electrically-induced transport
   and surface deformation phenomena during EHD patterning. The coupled
   multi-field equations are discretized in finite difference with an
   enhancement by parallel computing. For structured templates, the
   application of an electric field creates the conformal structures in the
   polymer film with the periodicity and aspect ratios of the polymer
   structures controlled by template patterns and applied electric fields.
   Analysis indicates that the interaction between the applied field and
   the fluids leads to an occurrence of complex flow structures and free
   surface deformation and plays an important role in determining the
   dynamics of an EHD patterning process.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical phase field model is developed to investigate the
   Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) subject to a horizontal electric
   field. The model entails the simultaneous solution of the electric field
   equation and the Navier-Stokes equation for fluid flow coupled with the
   phase field model for the evolution of the fluid-fluid interface
   deformation and morphology. The in-house Fortran code was developed to
   enable the computing. Results show that, for pure dielectric fluids, the
   presence of the horizontal electric field induces polarization charges
   and produces a Korteweg-Helmholtz force which acts to suppress the RTI.
   For poorly conducting liquids, for which a leaky dielectric description
   is more appropriate. In this model, both polarization and free charges
   present. The effect of the free charge in this case depends on the
   specific values of lambda(epsilon) and lambda(sigma). For the fluids of
   lambda(epsilon) >1, it aggravates RTI if lambda(sigma)<lambda(epsilon),
   and suppresses that when lambda(sigma)>lambda(epsilon).}},

   capable of predicting the evolution of electric field, bubble motion and
   deformation and the medium fluid. Numerical simulations were conducted
   to study the combined effect of coupled electrical force, gravity,
   surface tension and viscous force on the deformation and motion of a
   bubble as it ascends through the liquid. The liquid and gas are
   considered as the dielectric fluids and both vertical and horizontal

Abstract = {{An efficient methodology to capture the nonlinear responses of combustor
   systems with pre-stress and Coulomb friction is developed. The combustor
   systems experience wear at the interfaces between components due to
   flow-induced vibrations. In particular, wear has been observed at the
   interface between the transition piece and the hula seal, and at the
   interface between the hula seal and the liner. These interfaces are
   pre-stressed, and their vibratory response has a softening nonlinearity
   caused by Coulomb friction combined with micro-slip. In addition, the
   contact between the hula seal and the transition piece is that between a
   convex surface and a concave surface. Hence, geometric nonlinearity of
   the contact stiffness in the normal direction is present also. These
   phenomena are hard to capture by full order finite element approaches
   because they require time marching or harmonic balancing of very large
   models. To address this issue, we develop reduced order models (ROMs)
   which are specifically designed to capture Coulomb friction (combined
   with micro-slip and macro-slip). To demonstrate the proposed approach, a
   simplified hula seal is placed between two very rigid plates (which
   relate to the transition piece and the liner). For validation, con-tact
   elements are used to model the interface between the plates and the hula
   seal. Transient dynamic analysis (TDA) in ANSYS is applied to the full
   order model. The model is shown to exhibit softening nonlinearity and
   micro-slip at all levels of pre-stress. To show that ROMs for this
   system are possible (i.e., they exist), we use proper orthogonal
   decomposition to show that the dynamics is dominated by a low number of
   spatial coherences. For a variety of frequency ranges and pre-stress
   levels, we show that a single such coherence is dominant. Next, low
   order models are proposed and their parameters are identified A
   systematic method to identify these parameters is developed. Particular
   attention is paid to the amount of calculations needed for obtaining
   these parameters. Finally, the ROMs are validated by comparing their
   predictions with results from TDA for the full-order model. We show that
   these ROMs can accurately predict the nonlinear response of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Coupled bending and longitudinal vibrations in H-shaped planar frames
   are controlled from a wave standpoint, in which vibrations are described
   as waves traveling along uniform structural waveguides, and being
   reflected and transmitted at structural discontinuities. Active
   discontinuities are created using active control forces/moments both
   along structural elements and at structural joints to control vibration
   waves. The bending vibrations are modeled and controlled using the
   classical Euler-Bernoulli as well as the advanced Timoshenko theories.
   Numerical examples are presented. Comparisons are made between the
   results obtained using the classical Euler-Bernoulli model and the
   advanced Timoshenko model. Good agreements have been reached at low
   frequencies. However, discrepancies are significant at higher
   frequencies, typically when the transverse dimensions are not negligible
   with respect to the wavelength. This study addresses the importance of
   taking into account the effects of rotary inertia and shear distortion
   at high frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a hands-on laboratory solid mechanics project which
   was supervised as an independent study. The experimental study and
   analysis were focused on strain and stress transformation on cantilever
   beam subjected to bending within elastic range. A combination of five
   different metals and two types strain rosette arrangements were used in
   the experimentation. The project involves the design and construction of
   test facility and experimental analysis of tested piece. The samples of
   measured data and analysis are reported in this paper. The strains in
   rectangular and principal co-ordinates which were computed from measured
   strains enabled the stress in both co-ordinates to be determined. This
   analysis enables the students to determine experimentally, that the sum
   of normal strain and stresses are invariant. The teaching strategy
   employed to integrate fundamental theories with hands-on experiences is
   described. The effectiveness of the laboratory project in enhancing
   student learning of stress-strain transformation and project management
   skill was demonstrated by monitoring student performance improvements
   over the duration of the project. The success of this project leads to
   an experiment for teaching students stress-strain transformation in
   mechanics of materials laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{According to the behavioral finance theory, agents act coherently with
   the Kahneman and Tversky prospect paradigms and may violate those
   dictated by the rational expected utility. From the point of view of
   real financial markets' applications, a key question concerns how to
   eliciting the financial professionals' risk preferences. In this
   contribution we propose the benchmarking procedure originally set up by
   Castagnoli \& LiCalzi (1996) and Bordley \& LiCalzi (2000) that couples
   sound axiomatic fundamentals with a user-friendly language. According to
   the benchmarking modelling, to maximizing the expected cardinal utility
   is equivalent to maximizing the probability to meet a (uncertain) goal.
   It follows that the subjective preferences under risk can be expressed
   in terms of the probability of matching financial benchmarks. Since
   practitioners may feel more comfortable in answering questions involving
   perceived probability of meeting commitments than expressing preferences
   on lotteries' outcomes, the use of the benchmarking modelling is
   expected to reduce inconsistency in questionnaires.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) is a re-emerging technique to process
   probability data encoded in digital bit-streams. Its main advantage is
   that arithmetic operations can be implemented by extremely small and
   low-power logic circuits. This makes SC suitable for signal-processing
   applications involving matrix operations whose VLSI implementation is
   very costly. Previous SC approaches only address basic matrix operations
   with relatively low accuracy needs. We explore the use of SC to
   implement a representative complex matrix operation, namely eigenvector
   computation. We apply it to a training task for visual face recognition,
   and show that our SC design has performance comparable to its
   conventional binary counterpart, while being able to trade computation
   time for accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Most of conventional structure safety designs for collision are dampers,
   such as controlled plastic deformation, the energy of collision is
   released. However this method cannot be reused because it works at
   expends of destroy of the structure. In this paper, a novel collision
   safety method based on Momentum-Exchange-Impact-Damper (MEID) system is
   applied. With MEID, the impact of the controlled object is reduced by
   transferring part of its momentum to an additional mass. Thus this
   reusable system reduces the acceleration and the rebound distance. This
   paper adopt a simplistic vehicle model with MEID system as a controlled
   object example. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified by
   simulations and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) is a low-cost design technique that has great
   promise in applications such as image processing. SC enables arithmetic
   operations to be performed on stochastic bit-streams using ultra-small
   and low-power circuitry. However, accurate computations tend to require
   long run-times due to the random fluctuations inherent in stochastic
   numbers (SNs). We present novel techniques for SN generation that lead
   to better accuracy/run-time trade-offs. First, we analyze a property
   called progressive precision (PP) which allows computational accuracy to
   grow systematically with run-time. Second, borrowing from Monte Carlo
   methods, we show that SC performance can be greatly improved by
   replacing the usual pseudo-random number sources by low-discrepancy (LD)
   sequences that are predictably progressive. Finally, we evaluate the use
   of LD stochastic numbers in SC, and show they can produce significantly
   faster and more accurate results than existing stochastic designs.}},

Abstract = {{The expected low reliability of the silicon substrate at upcoming
   technology nodes presents a key challenge for digital system designers.
   Networks-on-chip (NoCs) are especially concerning because they are often
   the only communication infrastructure for the chips in which they are
   deployed. Recently, routing reconfiguration solutions have been proposed
   to address this problem. However, they come at a high silicon cost, and
   often require suspending the normal network activity while executing a
   centralized, resource-hungry reconfiguration algorithm. This paper
   proposes a novel, fast and minimalistic routing reconfiguration
   algorithm, called BLINC. BLINC utilizes precomputed routing metadata to
   quickly evaluate localized detours upon each fault manifestation. We
   showcase the efficacy of our algorithm by deploying it in a novel NoC
   fault detection and reconfiguration solution, where BLINC enables
   uninterrupted NoC operation during aggressive online testing. If a fault
   seems likely to occur, we circumvent it in advance with the aid of our
   BLINC reconfiguration algorithm. Experimental results show an 80\%
   reduction in the average number of routers affected by a reconfiguration
   event, compared to state-of-the-art techniques. BLINC enables negligible
   performance degradation in our detection and reconfiguration solution,
   while solutions based on current techniques suffer a 17-fold latency
   increase.}},

   times better than CMOS ASIC and memristive CMOL implementations,
   respectively. Under the same area budget, the proposed DW-AES exhibits

Abstract = {{Up to now, much of the research into active vibration suppression pays
   little attention to energy usage, concentrating on response performance
   often at the expense of power consumption. Our work focuses on
   developing energy efficient solutions, ideally self-powered, to control
   unwanted responses. To do so, we explore the idea using electromagnetic
   components to enable vibration control, minimum energy usage and energy
   recovery. Energy can be harvested by recovering part of the energy
   traditionally dissipated as heat in a damper. We investigate how this
   harvested power together with the electromagnetic unit can be used for
   semi-active vibration control. The strategy presented in this work shows
   how, using passive capacitances, we can design an electromagnetic
   vibration absorber (EVA) that is able to change its natural frequency
   and damping ratio in real time at minimum energy cost. This strategy is
   being tested experimentally by performing real time dynamic
   substructuring testing (RTDS).}},

Abstract = {{Today's cyber defenses are largely static. They are governed by slow
   deliberative processes involving testing, security patch deployment, and
   human-in-the-loop monitoring. As a result, adversaries can
   systematically probe target networks, pre-plan their attacks, and
   ultimately persist for long times inside compromised networks and hosts.
   A new class of technologies, called Adaptive Cyber Defense (ACD), is
   being developed that presents adversaries with optimally changing attack
   surfaces and system configurations, forcing adversaries to continually
   re-assess and re-plan their cyber operations. Although these approaches
   (e.g., moving target defense, dynamic diversity, and bio-inspired
   defense) are promising, they assume stationary and stochastic, but
   non-adversarial, environments. To realize the full potential, we need to
   build the scientific foundations so that system resiliency and
   robustness in adversarial settings can be rigorously defined,

Abstract = {{With the recent advances in smart grid technologies as well as the
   increasing dissemination of smart meters, the electricity usage of every
   moment can be detected in modern smart building environments. Thus, the
   utility company adopts different price of electricity at each time slot
   considering the peak time. This paper presents a new power consumption
   scheduling algorithm for smart buildings that adopts smart meters and
   real-time pricing of electricity. The proposed algorithm dynamically
   changes the power mode of each electric device according to the change
   of electricity prices. Specifically, we formulate the electricity usage
   scheduling problem as a real-time task scheduling problem, and show that
   it is a complex search problem that has an exponential time complexity.
   The proposed scheme uses an efficient heuristic based on genetic
   algorithms to cut down the huge searching space and finds a reasonable
   schedule within a feasible time budget. Experimental results with
   various building conditions show that the proposed algorithm reduces the
   electricity charge of a smart building by 25.6\% on average and up to
   33.4\%.}},

Abstract = {{To mitigate long term, soaking-induced delamination failure of
   multi-layered Parylene C devices, a post-process annealing step can be
   employed to increase adhesion between the Parylene layers. However, it
   has been shown that annealing of Parylene thin films can alter the bulk
   properties of the polymer, and thus impact final device performance. To
   elucidate these effects, the mechanical and electrochemical properties,
   and sensing performance of untreated and annealed Parylene C-platinum
   electrochemical impedance-based force sensors were compared. Annealing
   reduced the height (similar to 3\%) and increased the stiffness of the
   Parylene C sensing channel structure (similar to 1.6x), affecting the
   sensor's mechanical response. Furthermore, the electrode surface was
   smoothed as built-in residual stresses were removed during annealing,
   altering the sensor's electrochemical properties. Together, these
   phenomena resulted in a 24\% reduction in sensor sensitivity. These
   results indicate that heat-based effects cannot be ignored for
   Parylene-metal device systems, including neural microelectrode implants,
   and that mechanical and electrochemical properties and performance must
   be determined after heat treatment, such as annealing and sterilization.}},

   report a microfluidic chip that allows for isolating a pair of cells by
   using immiscible liquid isolation. We present the method of using a

   while maintaining the exchange of nutrition for long-term cell-cell

Abstract = {{In turbomachinery, blade crack detection methods are beneficial for
   condition-based maintenance and for reducing the risk of catastrophic
   failures due to high cycle fatigue of bladed disks. A crack can be more
   easily detected in a perfectly tuned bladed disk (i.e., with identical
   blades and sectors). That is because the crack causes mode distortion
   and possibly response localization. Unfortunately, perfectly tuned
   bladed disks are an idealization since small blade mistuning is
   unavoidable and it can also cause mode distortion and response
   localization in bladed disks.
   A detection method has been recently developed to detect the presence of
   a crack in a mistuned bladed disk and to identify which blade is
   cracked. The method requires multi-point measurements of all blades
   (e.g., obtained by using tip-timing techniques) and is based on the
   observation/assumption that the dynamic response of a cracked bladed
   disk cannot be represented as a linear combination of modes of the tuned
   system.
   This paper introduces a method which uses a similar physical basis for
   detection, but requires fewer measurements, namely one measurement
   location per blade (e.g., obtained using tip-timing methods). The key
   idea is to focus on isolated modes (or isolated mode pairs) which are
   sensitive to the presence of a crack rather than on an entire mode
   family (with high modal density). The novel method also extracts
   spatially correlated vectors from the nonlinear (forced response)
   measurement data of the cracked bladed disk to be used for crack
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{High-fidelity signal acquisition is critical for the fundamental control
   of a neuroprosthesis. Our group has developed a bio-artificial interface
   consisting of a muscle graft neurotized by a severed nerve in a rat hind
   limb model. This regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) permits
   nerve signal transmission, amplification, and detection via in situ
   electromyography (EMG). Our study examined the magnitude of signal
   interference from simultaneously contracting muscles adjacent to our
   muscle of interest.
   In eighteen F344 rats, the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was
   used to fabricate simulated RPNI constructs of various sizes in which
   the neurovascular pedicle was preserved, obviating the need for
   reinnervation or revascularization. After 3 weeks of recovery, in situ
   EMG testing was performed using electrical stimulation of the common
   peroneal nerve. A recording needle was placed in the EDL muscle with a
   reference/ground electrode in the contralateral toe webspace, comprising
   a monopolar recording configuration. The superficial peroneal nerve was
   transected to further isolate stimulation of the anterior compartment.
   Recordings from the EDL were performed before and after excision of the
   tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor hallucis longus (EHL) muscles.
   After TA/EHL excision, EDL compound muscle action potential (CMAP)
   peak-to-peak amplitudes were significantly lower by an average of 7.4
   +/- 5.6(SD) mV, or 32 +/- 18\%, (paired t(17)=-5.7, p<0.0001). A
   significant positive linear correlation was seen between CMAP amplitude
   and EDL mass both before TA/EHL excision (r=0.68, n=18, p<0.01) and
   after TA/EHL excision (r=0.79, n=18, p<0.0001). EDL mass did not
   correlate with differences in CMAP amplitude or area caused by TA/EHL
   excision.
   Monopolar needle EMG recordings from the EDL muscle are significantly,
   but predictively, contaminated by concomitant muscular contractions in
   the anterior compartment of the rat hind limb. Further investigation of
   strategies to reduce this signal interference, including electrode
   choice or configuration, use of bioelectrical insulators, and filtering
   methods, is warranted to promote high-fidelity signal acquisition for
   prosthetic control.}},

   multi-objective optimization, which is ubiquitous in many fields of

   sample size limit, the non-dominated fronts converge almost surely to
   the level sets of a function that satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi partial
   differential equation (PDE). We show how this PDE can be used to design

Abstract = {{A large number of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) parking decks connected
   to the power systems will bring up many problems which need to be
   addressed. An emerging issue is that a PEV parking deck needs a
   systematic optimal price reference for tomorrow's operation on
   electricity sale prices and parking fees for customers. This paper
   introduces a system including a price mechanism and three charging
   scenarios for different types of PEV parking decks to maximize their
   total revenue for the next 24 hours. Because different types of parking
   decks have various traffic behaviors (e.g., arrival and departure
   distribution), this system provides an exclusive price reference for
   each parking deck operator according to its historical traffic
   behaviors. First, the mathematical model of this system is introduced
   considering the real world constraints. Second, the case studies are
   performed to simulate the real world charging scenarios over 24 hours.
   The results provide the marginal electricity sale price for operators to
   decide the electricity sale price for customers in order to maintain the
   total revenue for tomorrow's operation. Finally, the expected total
   revenues of the next 24 hours are given by using three charging
   scenarios after the price decision has been made.}},

Abstract = {{Induction machines are an attractive alternative to permanent magnet
   machines in transportation applications due to their ruggedness and
   lower cost of construction. However, high-performance control of
   induction machines requires accurate knowledge of the machine
   parameters. While parameters have traditionally been identified using
   the standard ``no-load{''} and ``locked-rotor{''} tests, these tests are
   not representative of normal operating conditions, and are not well
   suited to the commissioning of variable speed drives. This paper
   presents a new method for induction machine parameter identification
   using steady-state measurements, which is based on fitting data to the
   stator current locus for various slip frequencies. Numerical results
   confirm the method's high accuracy, while experimental results
   demonstrate its ability to characterize an induction machine over a
   range of flux levels which include magnetic saturation.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, electrification is one of the most popular developing trends
   for traditional transportation system. To accomplish the
   electrification, some critical infrastructures (e.g., power grids and
   transportation networks) need to be reliable. In recent years, lots of
   efforts have been put to investigate the robustness of these services.
   But many of them only consider the services independently while they
   actually interact with each other in many aspects. The overall object of
   this paper is to investigate one of these interactions, the impact of
   transportation activities of PEVs on the power distribution system,
   especially regarding the stability and efficiency. The transportation
   network and the power distribution system are obtained from a
   large-scale penetration of plug-in electric vehicles in the metropolitan
   area. This paper proposes a comprehensive co-modeling and simulation
   platform for investigating the impact of PEV charging in the real world.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration for the
   electrification of transportation, aiming to create great opportunities
   for integrating research and education. Multiple unmanned ground
   electric vehicles are emulated using Lego Mindstorms EV3 education kits.
   We implement traffic logic (e.g., path tracking algorithm), voice and
   gesture control, and collision avoidance functionality into each
   vehicle. Every vehicle is able to communicate with each other and
   self-navigate on a 240-sqft platform using local measurement (e.g.,
   touch sensor, color sensor, and infrared sensor). Multiple vehicles are
   used to simulate the real-world traffic scenarios. Two demo-scale
   plug-in and wireless charging stations are also built up to mimic the
   dynamic charging for electric vehicles. Meanwhile, each vehicle can
   wirelessly communicate with the centralized transportation coordinator
   to find the best charging spot depending on location, user preference,
   and real-time pricing. In addition, each vehicle is equipped with an
   on-board battery monitoring system to measure the real-time battery
   state (e.g., current, voltage, and temperature) and estimate the battery
   state-of-charge (SOC). The user-friendly graphical interface is
   developed in Labview for each component of proof-of-concept
   demonstration. Most importantly, this demonstration is fully compatible
   with a variety of general purpose engineering software (e.g., Matlab,
   and Labview), and creates great opportunities for integrating research
   and education in Smart Grid and intelligent transportation systems.}},

Abstract = {{Resolution degradation in both the cross-range direction and range
   direction of SAR systems operating in sparse random media at
   millimeter-wave frequency is studied using a novel coherent propagation
   model that accounts for multiple scattering in the medium. For the
   purpose of demonstration, a 2D random medium composed of electrically
   large scatterers with high dielectric contrast and low surface fraction
   value is considered. The study is motivated by assessing the performance
   of future sub-millimeter-wave (sub-MMW) SAR systems with unprecedented
   imaging resolution working in a rainy environment. Monte Carlo
   techniques combined with a novel simulation algorithm called Statistical
   S-matrix Approach for Wave Propagation in Spectral Domain (SSWaP-SD) are
   used to efficiently characterize the resolution degradation of the SAR
   system. It is shown that the cross-range resolution degradation is
   severe for long distance wave propagation inside the random medium,

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the problem of map-based visual localization in
   urban environments for autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars have
   become a reality on roadways and are going to be a consumer product in
   the near future. One of the most significant road-blocks to autonomous
   vehicles is the prohibitive cost of the sensor suites necessary for
   localization. The most common sensor on these platforms, a
   three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LIDAR) scanner,
   generates dense point clouds with measures of surface reflectivity-which
   other state-of-the-art localization methods have shown are capable of
   centimeter-level accuracy. Alternatively, we seek to obtain comparable
   localization accuracy with significantly cheaper, commodity cameras. We
   propose to localize a single monocular camera within a 3D prior
   groundmap, generated by a survey vehicle equipped with 3D LIDAR
   scanners. To do so, we exploit a graphics processing unit to generate
   several synthetic views of our belief environment. We then seek to
   maximize the normalized mutual information between our real camera
   measurements and these synthetic views. Results are shown for two
   different datasets, a 3.0 k m and a 1.5 k m trajectory, where we also
   compare against the state-of-the-art in LIDAR map-based localization.}},

Abstract = {{A homography is traditionally formulated as a linear transformation and
   is used in multiple-view geometry as a linear map between projective
   planes (or images). Analogous to the use of homography-based techniques
   to calibrate a pin-hole camera, non-linear homographies extend the
   pinhole camera model to deal with non-linearities such as lens
   distortion.
   In this work, we propose a novel non-parametric nonlinear homography
   technique. Unlike a parametric non-linear mapping that can have inherent
   biases, this technique automatically adjusts model complexity to account
   for non-linearities in observed data. With this technique, we
   demonstrate non-parametric estimation of lens distortion from a single
   calibration image.
   We evaluate this technique on real-world lenses and show that this
   technique can improve the stability of camera-calibration. Furthermore,
   the non-parametric nature of our technique allows rectification of
   arbitrary sources of lens distortion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a novel method for estimating the sensor bias of
   three-axis magnetometers (or any other field sensor). Our approach
   employs relative angular position measurements to estimate the
   three-axis magnetometer measurement bias, significantly improving
   magnetometer-based attitude estimation. Relative angular position
   measurements can be calculated from a variety of sources, including
   multiview image registration or laser-based scan matching. We report two
   methods implementing this approach based on batch linear least squares
   and a real-time discrete Kalman filter. Compared with previously
   reported methods our approach is time independent and less restrictive
   with data sampling. In addition, our two methods (i) are empirically
   shown to impose less restrictive conditions for the movements of the
   instrument required for calibration, (ii) do not require knowledge of
   the direction of the field (e.g., the local magnetic field) or the
   attitude of the instrument, and (iii) also ensure convergence for the
   estimated parameters. The proposed methods are evaluated and compared
   with previously reported methods in both numerical simulation and in
   comparative experimental evaluation using cameras and magnetometer

Abstract = {{Visual odometry is typically formulated as a descriptor-based image
   feature tracking problem, followed by outlier rejection and simultaneous
   estimation of the scene structure and camera motion. We propose a
   fundamentally different formulation for the stereo case: a multi-scale
   search over pose to estimate the transformation that best aligns two
   sparse point clouds in image space. This has three main consequences.
   First, data association is descriptorless and implicit, supporting the
   use of features with indistinct appearance, such as edge features.
   Second, outlier rejection is subsumed by the use of a robust kernel and
   a joint feature alignment objective. Third, the method is robust to
   local minima, in contrast to coarse-to-fine or iterative approaches.
   This paper details the proposed method, which we call Perspective
   Alignment Search (PAS), integrated into an edge feature visual odometry
   system, and an evaluation against a LIDAR-based SLAM solution.}},

Abstract = {{For a robot to act in the world, it needs to build and maintain a simple
   and concise model of that world, from which it can derive safe
   opportunities for action and hazards to avoid. Unfortunately, the world
   itself is infinitely complex, containing aspects ({''}clutter{''}) that
   are not well described, or even well approximated, by the simple model.
   An adequate explanatory model must therefore explicitly delineate the
   clutter that it does not attempt to explain. As the robot searches for
   the best model to explain its observations, it faces a three-way
   trade-off among the coverage of the model, the degree of accuracy with
   which the model explains the observations, and the simplicity of the
   model. We present a likelihood function that addresses this trade-off.
   We demonstrate and evaluate this likelihood function in the context of a
   mobile robot doing visual scene understanding. Our experimental results
   on a corpus of RGB-D videos of cluttered indoor environments demonstrate
   that this method is capable of creating a simple and concise planar
   model of the major structures (ground plane and walls) in the
   environment, while separating out for later analysis segments of clutter
   represented by 3D point clouds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on an underactuated 3D bipedal robot with passive
   feet that can start from a quiet standing position, initiate a walking
   gait, and traverse the length of the laboratory (approximately 10 m) at
   a speed of roughly 1 m/s. The controller was developed using the method
   of virtual constraints, a control design method first used on the planar
   point-feet robots Rabbit and MABEL. For the preliminary experiments
   reported here, virtual constraints were experimentally tuned to achieve
   robust planar walking and then 3D walking. A key feature of the
   controller leading to successful 3D walking is the particular choice of
   virtual constraints in the lateral plane, which implement a lateral
   balance control strategy similar to SIMBICON. To our knowledge, MARLO is
   the most highly underactuated bipedal robot to walk unassisted in 3D.}},

Abstract = {{In many robotic applications, especially long-term outdoor deployments,
   the success or failure of feature-based image registration is largely
   determined by changes in lighting. This paper reports on a method to
   learn visual feature point descriptors that are more robust to changes
   in scene lighting than standard hand-designed features. We demonstrate
   that, by tracking feature points in time-lapse videos, one can easily
   generate training data that captures how the visual appearance of
   interest points changes with lighting over time. This training data is
   used to learn feature descriptors that map the image patches associated
   with feature points to a lower-dimensional feature space where Euclidean
   distance provides good discrimination between matching and non-matching
   image patches. Results showing that the learned descriptors increase the
   ability to register images under varying lighting conditions are
   presented for a challenging indoor-outdoor dataset spanning 27 mapping
   sessions over a period of 15 months, containing a wide variety of
   lighting changes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a novel method to measure the contraction
   length and force output of Pneumatic Artificial Muscles. Our key
   innovation is to make the braid of these fiber-reinforced actuators out
   of insulated wires that form a single electric circuit. Changes in the
   inductance and resistance of this circuit can be related to muscle
   contraction length and muscle force. We implemented the proposed
   approach in two McKibben muscles that were evaluated under a variety of
   air pressures (0-200 kPa) and loads (0-45 N). The experiments confirmed
   our theoretical prediction of a roughly linear relationship between the
   measured inductance and the contraction length, as well as a strong
   correlation between the measured resistance and the actuator force. We
   were able to determine force with a resolution of 5N and contraction
   length with a resolution of 0.5 mm. This technique can be used to create
   flexible, precise, and robust self-sensing actuators that benefit a
   multitude of robotic applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explore the potential of trajectory optimization for
   unspecified contact sequences as a tool to identify optimal gaits and
   motions for legged robots. This work is based on a recently proposed
   method that states the mechanical dynamics in a floating base
   description, makes the ground contact forces part of the free variable
   vector, and implements the requirement that a foot is either on the
   ground or that the corresponding contact force is zero via a set of
   complimentary conditions. We introduce an algorithmic improvement that
   uses higher order integration for states that are continuous through
   collisions and thus increases the accuracy of the obtained solutions.
   The benefits of the proposed changes are evaluated with the models of a
   1D hopper and a 2D bipedal robot, and we additionally compare our
   results with analytic solutions and an established multiple shooting
   implementation. The proposed method was able to automatically discover
   walking and running as the most energetically economic ways of
   locomotion for a conceptual biped that is moving at different speed. It
   additionally discovers an elastic walking gait that is used at
   intermediate velocities.}},

Abstract = {{Building on our previous work on passive dynamic walking with
   quadrupeds, we show that a large variety of gaits can be created
   completely passively by a quadrupedal model with elastic legs. Similar
   to the well-known Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum model for bipeds, we
   created a conceptual quadrupedal model with elastic massless legs. To
   obtain a well-defined sequence of ground contact, we defined three
   distinct phases for each leg: stance, swing, and wait for touch down.
   Since a leg cannot make contact during swing, modifying the duration of
   this phase allows us to prevent feet from striking the ground
   prematurely. Gaits were identified in a single shooting implementation,
   such that the contact sequence was only influenced by the starting
   values of the numerical integration. By varying these values, we were
   able to identify trotting, pacing, walking, toelting, bounding, and
   galloping within a single model. For each of the identified gaits, we
   report the footfall pattern, ground contact forces, speed, and first
   order limit cycle stability.}},

Abstract = {{Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome characterized by widespread
   pain, fatigue, and memory and mood disturbances. Despite advances in our
   understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, treatment is often
   challenging. New research indicates that changes in functional
   connectivity between brain regions, as can be measured by magnetic
   resonance imaging (fcMRI) of the resting state, may underlie the
   pathogenesis of this and other chronic pain states. As such, this
   parameter may be able to be used to monitor changes in brain function
   associated with pharmacological treatment, and might also be able to
   predict treatment response. We performed a resting state fcMRI trial
   using a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design to investigate
   mechanisms of action of milnacipran (MLN), a selective serotonin and
   norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), in fibromyalgia patients. Our
   aim was to identify functional connectivity patterns at baseline that
   would differentially predict treatment response to MLN as compared to
   placebo. Since preclinical studies of MLN suggest that this medication
   works by augmenting antinociceptive processes, we specifically
   investigated brain regions known to be involved in pain inhibition.
   15 fibromyalgia patients completed the study, consisting of 6 weeks of
   drug and placebo intake (order counterbalanced) with an interspersed 2
   week wash out period. As a main finding we report that reductions in
   clinical pain scores during MLN were associated with decreased
   functional connectivity between pro-nociceptive regions and
   antinociceptive pain regions at baseline, specifically between the
   rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insular
   cortex (IC), as well as between the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the
   IC: patients with lower preexisting functional connectivity had the
   greatest reduction in clinical pain. This pattern was not observed for
   the placebo period. However a more robust placebo response was
   associated with lower baseline functional connectivity between the ACC
   and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This study indicates that ACC-IC
   connectivity might play a role in the mechanism of action of MLN, and
   perhaps more importantly fcMRI might be a useful tool to predict
   pharmacological treatment response. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{The Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) helical actuation architecture overcomes
   the typical strain limitations of straight wire SMA actuators by
   producing larger stroke in a small package size. SMA Helical actuators
   also provide design tailorability where the tightness of the coil can be
   used to make tradeoffs between force and displacement, along with the
   coupled tradeoff between package length and diameter. These are very
   attractive for industrial settings such as the automotive industry, but
   require models and design processes to support the needs of the quick,
   early design cycles typically required. This paper presents an
   experimentally-based parameter study from which a streamlined design
   process is extracted. SMA helical actuators with a range of wire
   diameters and coil diameters were fabricated and experimentally
   characterized. The functional dependence of performance metrics such as
   austenite stiffness, force level of the martensite plateau, and
   recoverable strain were evaluated. A two-step decoupled design procedure
   is presented based on the resulting empirical model where the kinematic
   design is first undertaken to select the spring index which provides the

Abstract = {{In many applications, the detection of changing gaseous or liquid
   concentration within an environment is accomplished by monitoring the
   shift in resonance frequency of a microelectromechanical system designed
   to adsorb the target analyte. Recently, mass sensing using the onset and
   crossing of a dynamic bifurcation has been shown to reduce the mass
   threshold which may be detected. This approach effectively replaces
   detection of an analog quantity resolved by hardware capability (phase
   shift or resonant frequency) with a digital quantity having fundamental
   resolution restricted by system noise (crossing the bifurcation). While
   promising, successful sensing with oscillators continually excited near
   a system bifurcation is practically limited in performance by repeatable
   characteristics close to the critical crossing frequency and the passive
   detection ability of the sensors has not yet extended to mass
   quantization over a period of time. In this research, we explore an
   alternative method to exploit bifurcation for mass sensing by utilizing
   a new sensor system composed of a small bistable element within a
   primary linear host sensor that helps alleviate these concerns. The
   proposed system design provides adjustable control of the rate at which
   the bifurcation is crossed, helping to tailor the sensitivities of the
   system encountered in the transition region, introduces new bifurcations
   to exploit, and lends the opportunity to utilize the numerous
   bifurcation phenomena sequentially to denote mass accumulation quantity
   occurring between consecutive jump events. The conceptual underpinnings
   of the method are presented in detail and example operational trials are
   demonstrated by simulation to expound its operation and adjustability.
   Discussion is provided to evaluate the system in terms of existing
   bifurcation-based mass sensing approaches and to outline remaining
   goals.}},

Abstract = {{Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wire ratchet actuators overcome SMA wire strain
   limitations by accumulating actuation stroke over multiple cycles. The
   underlying architecture is effective for producing large strokes from a
   small package, creating continuous rotation or extended displacement,
   and precise. It also provides discrete positioning with zeropower hold.
   While there have been several successful implementations of SMA ratchet
   actuators, most are designed ad-hoc since limited models exist to
   predict the stroke and force interaction during actuation cycles. Since
   the SMA wire actuation is highly dependent on the forces experienced
   through the ratchet mechanism, a model requires the prediction of the
   force interaction between the rack and pawl teeth along with friction in
   the device, and of the external force variation over actuation cycles
   due to the relative position change between the external system and the
   SMA wire. This paper presents a model-based systematic design
   methodology for SMA ratchet actuator which actuates position-dependent
   external systems. A generalized ratchet mechanism and operation sequence
   is introduced along with a force balance model for both austenite and
   martensite equilibrium to address the mechanical coupling changes.
   Analytical kinematic and kineto-static rack and pawl interaction models
   are reviewed, which feed into the force balance models. The effective
   stroke is evaluated by subtracting backlash from the SMA wire stroke,
   found through equilibrium with the mechanism and external system. This
   effective stroke accumulates to produce the overall actuator motion. A
   design methodology is suggested along with visualization methods to aid
   design decisions. Parametric studies expose the effects of design
   parameters on the SMA ratchet actuator to gain further design insight.
   This model-based design foundation and parametric understanding enable
   the synthesis of SMA wire ratchet actuators.}},

Abstract = {{The highly flexible and extensible wing skin of bats enables various
   wing shapes and flight modes, which distinguishes it from all other
   natural flyers making bats an ideal model for micro-aerial vehicles. We
   propose that an understanding of the relationship between the structure,
   properties and function of the wing tissue is essential to replicate and
   utilize the bat's natural capabilities. In this work, we present the
   first biaxial mechanical characterization of bat wing skin, identify key
   mechanisms in its deformation, and employ these concepts to fabricate
   biomimetic skins. Ten Glossophaga soricina bat specimens were available
   for experiment obtained from Prof. Swartz or Brown University. Of the 20
   excised wing skin samples, 11 were used for establishing testing
   protocols, 3 tore during preparation, and 6 were tested for the
   characterization presented in this work. The tissue was shown to be
   nonlinear, heterogeneous, anisotropic, and viscoelastic. The wrinkled
   tissue structure and substantial anisotropy promote great spanwise
   deployment and deformation increasing wing area and aspect ratio
   enabling greater lift generation. Comparison of the material structural
   organization with strain field responses demonstrated that the
   underlying fiber architecture corresponds to observed local strain
   variations and that the tissue represents a departure from traditional
   fiber reinforced materials since the mesoscopic, elastin fiber
   architecture appears to be the soft component while the matrix provides
   the stiffening role. Fabricated skins capture the inherent mismatch in
   natural configurations of the spanwise elastin fibers and the matrix and
   exhibit the characteristic wrinkle pattern observed in the in vivo bat
   wing skin. Future work will include static mechanical testing of the
   synthetic skins as well as aerodynamic testing to investigate the link
   between tissue structure, properties and functional flight capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, a concept of earthworm-like robot with fluidic
   flexible matrix composite ((FMC)-M-2) segments as its actuators is
   investigated. It explores a novel application of (FMC)-M-2 in the
   bionics field. Firstly, a general kinematics model of robot with
   earthworm-like locomotion is developed. Based on this model, the
   locomotion mechanism is analyzed in order to determine the actuation
   performance requirement for the (FMC)-M-2 segment. Then an analytical
   model of the (FMC)-M-2 segment is adopted to estimate the finite
   deformation under internal pressurization. By doing so, the optimal
   configuration of the (FMC)-M-2 segment that meets the requirements as an
   actuator is determined. A conceptual design of the earthworm-like robot
   based on (FMC)-M-2 segment is presented. After that, robotic gaits are
   constructed based on the kinematic locomotion mechanism with some
   necessary physical assumptions. Directed locomotion can be achieved
   based on the constructed gaits. Aiming at increasing the average
   velocity and motion efficiency of the robot, locomotion gaits are
   optimized. Optimal gaits corresponding to the maximal velocity and
   maximal locomotion efficiency are obtained, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The analytical modeling and experimental investigation of a nonlinear
   electromagnetic rotational energy harvester, which can harvest power
   from rotary and translational excitations, are presented. Some
   application of energy harvesting such as energy harvesting for tire
   pressure sensing require an energy harvester which is efficient in
   generating power from rotational ambient vibrations. The majority of
   literature on vibration energy harvesting assumes that the ambient
   excitations are along a single axis. The vibrations from human motion or
   rotary machines have two components of translational motion as well as a
   strong rotary motion. The energy harvesting device studied in this paper
   is a pendulum like device. The base excitations result in rotations of a
   pendulum. The pendulum is connected to a direct current micro generator.
   The rotational vibrations of the pendulum generates electricity through
   the DC generator. Since the energy harvester is responsive to both
   translational and rotational base excitations, it is called Hybrid
   Rotary-Translational (HRT) generator.
   In this paper a small size HRT harvester is introduced and modeled. The
   model is used to investigate the relation between the frequency and the
   amplitude of base vibrations on the vibrations and power generation
   characteristics of the HRT system. For each frequency and amplitude of
   vibrations the coexistence of multiple solutions and their basin of
   attractions are investigated. Three types of ambient excitations are
   studied: rotational, translational along the direction of gravity, and
   translational normal to the direction of the gravity.}},

Abstract = {{A vehicle and driver model from {[}1] is here integrated with a finite
   state model describing mode switches among spark-ignited (SI) combustion
   and the advanced combustion modes spark assisted compression ignition
   (SACI) and homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). The model is
   used to quantify the influence of mode switch fuel penalties on drive
   cycle fuel economy considering the federal test procedure (FTP-75) and
   highway fuel economy test (HWFET). The simulation under the assumed fuel
   penalties and dynamics shows a very small fuel loss due to harmful
   switches. Harmful switches are mode switches that lead to short stays in
   the advanced combustion, where the penalty in switching is greater than
   the benefit achieved after the switch. The simulations also highlight
   the benefits of integrating the SACI mode. Apart from extending the fuel
   efficiency improvements beyond the HCCI range, it is postulated that
   SACI combustion is easier to reach (lower fuel penalty and faster
   response than the HCCI-SI switch) from both SI and HCCI, creating a
   bridge and an economic destination in the overall speed-load space. The
   combined operation of SACI and HCCI leads to substantially higher
   improvements, especially for the FTP-75 drive cycle, than using either
   mode individually.}},

Abstract = {{Grasping and twisting are basic motor skills for the execution of
   activities in daily life such as opening a door with a door knob. We
   study the relationship between grip force and hand trajectory during a
   grasp and twist task when unexpected load torques are encountered. The
   experimental results on grip force development and hand trajectories are
   consistent with similar studies on grasp and lift tasks in the
   literature. We also seek to build a simple model to study human
   feedforward control during grasp and twist movement. Our model includes
   a position source and driving point impedance. We provide detailed
   procedures to identify the relationship between the impedance values and
   grip forces and the algorithm to estimate the position source. We check
   our model by comparing the model prediction and experimental data on
   certain catch trial trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{Humans remain in the loop in teleoperation because they have some
   knowledge that the robot they are controlling does not. At the same time
   teleoperated robots can be programmed to be very good at many tasks,
   such as avoiding obstacles. Therefore, sharing control between a human
   and semi-autonomous behaviors on a robot has great potential. This paper
   presents a model predictive control (MPC) shared control framework for
   blending human inputs with autonomous behavior inputs. This work adds
   consideration of how the human input differs from that of an autonomous
   controller in addition to threat of collision. The framework is applied
   to a high speed differential drive robot moving through an obstacle
   field. Preliminary tests by the authors compared the MPC shared control
   framework to switching obstacle avoidance on/off and the proposed MPC
   shared control gives the human up to 26\% more control with a 35\%
   reduction in collision penalty. Compared to pure human control, MPC
   shared control demonstrated a 66\% reduction in collision penalty.
   Results show promise for increased user control with better performance.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the need to control complex hydronic systems, this paper
   presents and analyzes control strategies for energy efficient thermal
   load regulation by means of a model-predictive control (MPC) embedded
   into a low-power wireless controller. Hydronic systems are found in a
   wide variety of applications such as building controls, industrial
   plants, and naval vessels. A laboratory test-bed which models a simple
   hydronic system is used to assess the proposed control solutions. The
   key design parameters analyzed by this paper are the form of the
   objective function and the structure of the model used for open-loop
   (OL) optimization during each step of the MPC solution. Objective
   functions were evaluated based on complexity and efficacy in meeting the
   stated goal of efficient thermal load regulation. The hydronics were
   modeled as first-order linear differential equations with non-linear
   time-varying constraints on control, and as bi-linear differential
   equations in which the control variable is multiplied by the state but
   constrained linearly. To minimize the objective functions associated
   with OL trajectories, a gradient descent algorithm was selected which
   balanced real-time execution with microcontroller (MCU) computing power.
   Parametric studies were performed in simulation and experiment to show
   that a low-power MCU could be used to efficiently control hydronic
   plants using MPC.}},

Abstract = {{Shipboard electric propulsion systems experience large power and torque
   fluctuations on their drive shaft due to propeller rotational motions
   and waves. This paper explores new solutions to address the fluctuations
   by integrating a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) and exploring
   coordinated power management. A propeller and ship dynamic model, which
   captures the underlying physical behavior, is established to support the
   control development and system optimization. Given the fact that both
   high and low frequency contents exist in the power fluctuations, a
   combination of battery pack and ultracapacitor bank is proposed,
   coordinated control is developed, and performance is evaluated in
   different sea conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed HESS
   with model predictive control provides substantial benefits in terms of
   reducing fluctuation and sustaining self-operation, compared to other
   solutions that involve batteries or ultracapacitors alone. Moreover, our
   analysis shows that the benefits of HESS are achievable only through
   both effective power management and device coordination.}},

Abstract = {{By performing sensitivity analysis on an optimal task schedule, this
   paper derives a polynomial time method to determine whether the task
   schedule remains optimal after arbitrary changes to task costs occur. We
   consider fast reactive mission planning for unmanned aircraft in
   changing environments. Changing external conditions such as weather or
   threats may alter task costs, which can render an initially optimal task
   schedule suboptimal. Instead of optimizing the task schedule every time
   task costs change, stability criteria allow for fast evaluation of
   whether schedules remain optimal. This paper develops a method to
   compute stability regions for a set of schedules in a prototypical
   mission for unmanned aircraft, the traveling salesman problem, where the
   alternative schedules are part of a pre-approved mission plan. As the
   traveling salesman problem is NP-hard, heuristic methods are frequently
   used to solve it. The presented approach is also applicable to analyze
   stability regions for a tour obtained through application of the k-opt
   heuristic with respect to the k-neighborhood and is demonstrated with an
   example problem.}},

   communication to control their longitudinal motion. While V2V
   communication potentially allows vehicles to build detailed knowledge
   about the traffic environment, intermittencies and packet drops
   introduce stochastic delays into the communication channels that make
   control very challenging. Moreover, while communication and control
   occurs in discrete time, vehicle dynamics still takes place in
   continuous time. We convert the dynamics to discrete time and analyze
   the effects of stochastic delays on vehicular platoons. We derive plant
   and string stability conditions for the mean dynamics and show how the
   stable regimes shrink when the sampling time or the packet drop ratio
   increases. Our results have important implications regarding safety and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a constrained attitude control approach for
   performing spacecraft reorientation maneuvers that maintain specified
   body vectors within inclusion zones and out of exclusion zones, while
   respecting control authority limits. The controller uses a supervisory
   switching strategy with an inner-loop Lyapunov SO(3)-based controller
   and an outer-loop set-point guidance. A virtual net of orientation
   equilibria covering SO(3) is introduced, and positively invariant
   constraint admissible sets on SO(3) x R-3 of the inner loop controller
   are constructed to determine if equilibria are connected by a feasible
   trajectory. Optimization procedures to maximize the size of the
   positively-invariant sets are discussed. Graph search is used in the
   outer-loop to compute the set-point sequence leading from an initial
   orientation to a final orientation that rigorously enforces constraints.
   The proposed methodology reduces the search space of possible attitude
   maneuver solutions, and has computational and implementation simplicity.
   Numerical simulation results are reported to illustrate the performance
   of the proposed constrained attitude control methodology.}},

Abstract = {{High torque density and the potential for high efficiency have made
   Surface-Mount Permanent Magnet machines an attractive option for many
   high-performance drive applications. However, parameter variations due
   to temperature changes, skin effect, and magnetic saturation, can detune
   the transient characteristics of the drive, and cause large mismatches
   in torque regulation. The approach presented in this paper utilizes a
   combination of adaptively tuned feedforward and feedback-decoupling
   terms, in addition to standard proportional feedback for added
   robustness. The resulting controller achieves consistent transient
   response characteristics with zero steady-state error over a wide range
   of operating points, without the use of integral control. The adaptive
   law is derived using Lyapunov's stability theorem, and the resulting
   adaptive controller is tested numerically in Simulink. Experimental
   results confirm the performance of the proposed adaptive controller.}},

Abstract = {{When unmanned aircraft systems operate in urban corridors, navigation
   accuracy is a priority due to proximity of buildings, obstructions, and
   other infrastructure. In most environments a Global Positioning System
   (GPS)/inertial measurement unit combination along with an air data sytem
   can provide accurate navigation capability. However, this is not
   possible in urban corridors where GPS has well-documented degradation.
   Other sensors such as vision-based systems and Long-Term Evolution
   transceivers have shown to be useful in urban settings, but modeling
   them individually is difficult without an in-depth understanding of each
   sensor and the factors dictating its accuracy. This paper proposes a
   framework to model location-dependent accuracy of navigation and how
   this changes within the urban environment. Results show that persistent
   machine vision can provide accurate navigation capability, but LTE with
   its current measurement delay does not have a noticeable positive effect
   on navigation accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), used often by the Armed Forces for
   Surveillance and Reconnaissance (S\&R) missions, are powerful
   classification agents to inspect objects of interest (OOIs) under human
   supervision. To achieve improved decision-making, we have previously
   explored the idea of a two-tiered classification structure, where a
   primary trichotomous classifier (machine) precedes a secondary
   dichotomous classifier (human). The trend for future operations is for a
   single operator to control an increasing number of UAVs. However, low
   human-to-UAV ratio can result in a stressful situation for the human
   operator, which is undesirable for successful classification and UAV
   management. To address this issue, we extend our previous work to a
   three-tiered classification scheme, where an intermediate revisit sensor
   makes a decision to revisit the OOI in cases where the primary
   classifier is unsure, which can be caused by noisy sensor data or
   viewing from a poor vantage point. We compare the performance (i.e., the
   probability of misclassification) under single, two-tiered, and
   three-tiered classifier schemes and show the efficacy of the proposed
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{Precise control of piston turnaround location is essential for reliable
   free- piston engine ( FPE) operation. In this paper we derive a
   discrete- time, control- oriented, implicit model that describes FPE
   clearance height behavior by applying an energy balance to the Otto
   cycle. We then design a state feedback controller using dynamic
   inversion that stabilizes the FPE system and ensures reference tracking.
   To compensate for a single time step output delay we add a Smith
   predictor and use Newton's method to forecast piston position. As
   demonstrated with a physics- based model, the proposed controller
   successfully stabilizes the FPE and tracks clearance set points.
   However, abrupt hydraulic load changes can cause the piston to travel
   outside a safe operating range. To enforce constraints on piston motion,
   we augment the system with a reference governor that manages hydraulic
   load transitions. The reference governor uses Newton's method applied to
   the implicit control- oriented model for prediction in conjunction with
   a bisection search algorithm to calculate the maximum possible load
   increase, that if held constant, will satisfy the constraints for all
   future time steps. Model uncertainty can be accounted for by tightening
   constraints. When implemented on the physics- based FPE model, the
   reference governor successfully enforces a piston turnaround position
   constraint of +/- 0.5 mm from a nominal set point during a load change.}},

Abstract = {{We present a two-layer representation of the locally sensed 3D indoor

   the geometric structure of the environment to reason about the
   navigation opportunities for an agent in the environment. The first
   layer is the Planar Semantic Model (PSM), a geometric representation in
   terms of meaningful planes (ground and walls). PSM captures more
   semantics of the indoor environment than a pure planar model because it
   represents a richer set of relationships among planar segments. In the
   second layer, we present the Action Opportunity Star (AOS), which
   describes the set of qualitatively distinct opportunities for robot
   action available in the neighborhood of the robot. Our two-layer
   representation is a concise representation of indoor environments,
   semantically meaningful to both robot and to human. It is capable of
   capturing incomplete knowledge of the local environment so that unknown
   areas can be incrementally learned as observations become available.
   Experimental results on a variety of indoor environments demonstrate the
   expressive power of our representation.}},

   Thus, computationally-efficient models for electric machines and drives

   In this paper, a finite-element-based method for quickly generating
   torque-speed curves and efficiency maps for electric machines and drives
   is presented. First, magneto-static finite element analysis (FEA) is
   conducted on a ``base{''} machine design. This analysis produces
   normalized torque, flux linkage, current, and losses for the operating
   points of interest. These values are then adjusted based upon changing
   the size of the machine and the effective number of turns of the machine
   windings to quickly generate a variety of new machine designs and their

   misalignment tolerance in this system is analyzed and discussed. The
   distinct features of rectangular bipolar topology have been exploited to
   develop the pads for wireless battery chargers for EV applications. An
   8kW wireless charger prototype with 200mm gap and +/-300mm horizontal
   misalignment tolerance has been fabricated and tested. From optimal to
   critical points of horizontal misalignments, the coupling coefficient of
   this system can maintain from 18.8\% to 31.1\%. With a 200mm gap, the
   charger efficiently transfers energy with an efficiency of 95.66\%
   (overall DC to DC) at the desired position while still maintains at
   95.39\% efficiency with a +/-300mm horizontal misalignment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the characteristics of battery packs with
   parallel-connected lithium-ion battery cells. To investigate the
   influence of cell inconsistency problem in parallel-connected cells, a
   group of different degraded lithium-ion battery cells were selected to
   build various battery packs and test them using a battery test bench.
   The physical model was developed to simulate the operation of the
   parallel-connected packs. The experimental results and simulation
   indicate that with different degraded cells in parallel, there could be
   capacity loss and large difference in discharge current, which may cause
   further accelerated degradation and more serious inconsistency problem.}},

   eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of one-speed slabs, and perform
   eigenfunction expansion to approximate the time-dependent flux response

   interpretation that the operator in the adjoint alpha-eigenvalue problem
   describes a continuous-time Markov process, i.e., elements of this
   operator are rates defining particles transitioning among the
   position-energy-direction phase space. A forward Monte Carlo simulation
   tallies these elements for a discretized phase space, using careful
   bookkeeping during the random walk. We compare calculated eigenvalues
   and eigenfunctions to those obtained by the Green's Function Method for

Abstract = {{Chemo- and radiation therapies used to treat cancer can have the
   unintended effect of making patients infertile. Clinically established
   fertility preservation methods, such as egg and embryo cryopreservation,
   are not applicable to all patients, which has motivated the development
   of strategies that involve ovarian tissue removal and cryopreservation
   before the first sterilizing treatment. To restore fertility at a later
   date, the early-stage follicles present in the tissue must be matured to
   produce functional oocytes, a process that is not possible using
   existing cell culture technologies. This review describes the
   application of tissue engineering principles to promote ovarian follicle
   maturation and produce mature oocytes through either in vitro culture or
   transplantation. The design principles for these engineered systems are
   presented, along with identification of emerging opportunities in
   reproductive biology.}},

Abstract = {{A worthy goal for the structural health monitoring field is the creation
   of a scalable monitoring system architecture that abstracts many of the
   system details (e. g., sensors, data) from the structure owner with the
   aim of providing ``actionable{''} information that aids in their
   decision making process. While a broad array of sensor technologies have
   emerged, the ability for sensing systems to generate large amounts of
   data have far outpaced advances in data management and processing. To
   reverse this trend, this study explores the creation of a cyber-enabled
   wireless SHM system for highway bridges. The system is designed from the
   top down by considering the damage mechanisms of concern to bridge
   owners and then tailoring the sensing and decision support system around
   those concerns. The enabling element of the proposed system is a
   powerful data repository system termed SenStore. SenStore is designed to
   combine sensor data with bridge meta-data (e. g., geometric
   configuration, material properties, maintenance history, sensor
   locations, sensor types, inspection history). A wireless sensor network
   deployed to a bridge autonomously streams its measurement data to
   SenStore via a 3G cellular connection for storage. SenStore securely
   exposes the bridge meta-and sensor data to software clients that can
   process the data to extract information relevant to the decision making
   process of the bridge owner. To validate the proposed cyber-enable SHM
   system, the system is implemented on the Telegraph Road Bridge (Monroe,
   MI). The Telegraph Road Bridge is a traditional steel girder-concrete
   deck composite bridge located along a heavily travelled corridor in the
   Detroit metropolitan area. A permanent wireless sensor network has been
   installed to measure bridge accelerations, strains and temperatures.
   System identification and damage detection algorithms are created to
   automatically mine bridge response data stored in SenStore over an
   18-month period. Tools like Gaussian Process (GP) regression are used to
   predict changes in the bridge behavior as a function of environmental
   parameters. Based on these analyses, pertinent behavioral information
   relevant to bridge management is autonomously extracted.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated a number of different damage detection
   algorithms for structural health monitoring of a typical suspension
   bridge. The Alfred Zampa Memorial Bridge, a part of the Interstate 80 in
   California, was selected for this study. The focus was to implement and
   validate simple damage detection algorithms for structural health
   monitoring of complex bridges. Accordingly, the numerical analysis
   involved development of a high fidelity finite element model of the
   bridge in order to simulate various structural damage scenarios. The
   finite element model of the bridge was validated based on the
   experimental modal properties. A number of damage scenarios were
   simulated by changing the stiffness of different bridge components
   including suspenders, main cable, bulkheads and deck. Several
   vibration-based damage detection methods namely the change in the
   stiffness, change in the flexibility, change in the uniform load surface
   and change in the uniform load surface curvature were employed to locate
   the simulated damages. The investigation here provides the relative
   merits and shortcomings of these methods when applied to long span
   suspension bridges. It also shows the applicability of these methods to
   locate the decay in the structure.}},

Abstract = {{For the discrete memoryless (DM) multiple access channel (MAC) with
   noiseless feedback Cover and Leung (CL) provided an achievable region
   that was later shown by Willems to be the capacity region for a special
   class of channels.
   In this paper, we investigate the generalization of the DM-MAC channel
   with state evolving as a Markov chain, with or without inter-symbol
   interference (ISI). The state is perfectly observed at the receiver and
   through noiseless feedback the state and output are also available at
   the transmitter with unit delay. For the case of no ISI, we provide an
   achievable region that can be thought of as the generalization of the CL
   region, and show that it is the capacity region of a special class of
   channels.
   For the case where ISI is present such a single-letter achievable region
   is harder to find. To address this difficulty, we start from the general
   multi-letter capacity expression derived by Permuter, Weissman and Chen
   for MACs with state and feedback, and attempt a reduction towards a
   single-letter expression. This novel-in the context of MACs-approach is
   based on viewing the multi-letter optimization problem as a stochastic
   control problem and finding a sufficient ``state{''} for control. The
   aforementioned reduction is not complete but it hints at a single-letter
   region that is proven to be achievable using typicality arguments.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs)

   long-term stability toward scalable and low-cost polymer electronics.
   This chapter deals with the various scalable processing methods and

   polymer electronics fabricated by the solution processes. Special
   attention on coating instability is elaborated in the context of
   important material components in PLEDs and OPVs. Proper coating
   techniques can be chosen by considering the thickness requirement of
   each functional layer with good reproducibility. Additionally, we will
   evaluate mechanical/optical characteristics of the polymer anode for
   ITO-free electrodes; and introduce the metal mesh in combination with

Abstract = {{Cytokine secretion assays provide the means to quantify
   intercellular-signaling proteins secreted by blood immune cells. These
   assays allow researchers and clinicians to obtain valuable information
   on the immune status of the donor. Previous studies have demonstrated
   that localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects enable
   label-free, real-time biosensing on a nanostructured metallic surface
   with simple optics and sensing tunability. However, limited sensitivity
   coupled with a lack of sample handling capability makes it challenging
   to implement LSPR biosensing in cellular functional immunoanalysis based
   on cytokine secretion assay. This paper describes our recent progress
   towards full development of a label-free LSPR biosensing technique to
   detect cell-secreted tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha cytokines in
   clinical blood samples. We integrate LSPR bionanosensors in an
   optofluidic platform capable of handling target immune cells in a
   microfluidic chamber while readily permitting optical access for

Abstract = {{This paper considers the effects of various damage features on guided
   wave (GW) propagation in isotropic and composite plates using both the
   local interaction simulation approach (LISA) and experimental methods.
   First, through-thickness holes in isotropic plates and graphite-epoxy
   laminates are simulated to establish LISA's ability to capture the GW
   scattering effects of various hole sizes and positions. GW generation
   from piezo-ceramic wafers is modeled using the recently developed LISA
   hybrid approach. The LISA results for the cross-ply case are compared
   with experimental measurements to evaluate the quality of the
   simulation. Next, low-velocity impact damage in composite plates is
   simulated and experimentally characterized. Barely-visible impact damage
   from a drop-weight fixture is analyzed using laser vibrometry and
   surface-mounted sensors to quantify its effect on GW fields. Three
   different methods of simulating the resulting impact are demonstrated
   using LISA, and the results are compared with the experiment to evaluate
   the damage modeling techniques. Results from the through-thickness hole
   study show the effect of sensor position on the strength of damage
   signals. Impact damage is successfully modeled in LISA using an inverted
   V-shaped profile with reductions in shear and elastic moduli.}},

   plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on (001) Silicon substrates. The
   growth of disks-in-nanowires heterostructures has been optimized and the
   nanowires have been passivated to achieve radiative efficiencies of 54\%
   and 52\% in the green and red InGaN disks, respectively. Radiative
   efficiency increases significantly (by similar to 10\%) when post-growth
   passivation of nanowire surface with silicon nitride or parylene is
   applied. Light emitting diodes on silicon, incorporating InGaN/GaN
   quantum disks as the active medium have been fabricated and the devices
   have been characterized. Quantum Confined Stark Effect (QCSE) blue-shift
   of 7nm and 15nm have been observed in the measured electroluminescence
   peak of the green and red LEDs respectively, from which polarization
   fields have been calculated in the disks to be 605kV/cm for green and
   1.26MV/cm for red. For green and red LEDs, external quantum efficiency
   peaks at current densities of similar to 25A/cm(2) and 12A/cm(2),

Abstract = {{This paper reports the experimental progress towards developing a
   multi-segment in-pipe robot inspired by earthworm's body structure and
   locomotion mechanism. To mimic the alternating contraction and
   elongation of a single earthworm's segment, a robust, servomotor based
   actuation mechanism is developed. In each robot segment,
   servomotor-driven cords and spring steel belts are utilized to imitate
   the earthworm's longitudinal and circular muscles, respectively. It is
   shown that the designed segment can contract and relax just like an
   earthworm's body segment. The axial and radial deformation of a single
   segment is measured experimentally, which agrees with the theoretical
   predictions. Then a multi-segment earthworm-like robot is fabricated by
   assembling eight identical segments in series. The locomotion
   performance of this robot prototype is then extensively tested in order
   to investigate the correlation between gait design and dynamic
   locomotion characteristics. Based on the principle of retrograde
   peristalsis wave, a gait generator is developed for the multi-segment
   earthworm-like robot, following which gaits of the robot can be
   constructed. Employing the generated gaits, the 8-segment earthworm-like
   robot can successfully perform both horizontal locomotion and vertical
   climb in pipes. By changing gait parameters, i.e., with different gaits,
   locomotion characteristics including average speed and anchor slippage
   can be significantly tailored. The proposed actuation method and
   prototype of the multi-segment in-pipe robot as well as the gait
   generator provide a bionic realization of earthworm's locomotion with
   promising potentials in various applications such as pipeline inspection
   and cleaning.}},

Abstract = {{After a fourteen year decimating civil war, the country of Liberia was
   left with the challenge of rebuilding its human and institutional
   capacity, particularly at the higher education level. The University of
   Michigan's College of Engineering was awarded part of a United States
   Agency for International Development grant to improve higher education
   in Liberia, namely the Excellence in Higher Education for Liberian
   Development program. Specifically, the University of Michigan's role in
   this grant is to increase the capacity of and enthusiasm among young
   students toward the two most crucial fields in the future of the
   country: engineering and agriculture. To accomplish this, the University
   of Michigan developed cocurricular programs at the secondary and
   university level that (i) create a pipeline of higher educational
   opportunities for students committed to pursuing careers in engineering
   and agriculture and (ii) increase the field-specific practical skills
   and breadth of experiences of those students. A specific focus of these
   co-curricular programs is on the development of soft skills of the
   participants-which are key for their future professional success.
   Already, within the first two years of implementation of these programs,
   unique and positive results have been demonstrated by the participants.
   The enthusiasm and commitment of the students toward engineering and
   agriculture has markedly increased. Furthermore, students have developed
   and improved their soft skills, such as public speaking, presentation
   skills, group work, communication skills, study skills, goal
   development, and critical thinking. In addition, the students exhibited
   a tremendous ability and initiative to work on open-ended community
   design projects.}},

Abstract = {{In the current offshore wind turbine support structure design method,
   the tower and foundation, which form the support structure are designed
   separately by the turbine and foundation designer. This method yields a
   suboptimal design and it results in a heavy, overdesigned and expensive
   support structure. This paper presents an integrated multidisciplinary
   approach to design the tower and foundation simultaneously.
   Aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, structure and soil mechanics are the
   modeled disciplines to capture the full dynamic behavior of the
   foundation and tower under different environmental conditions. The
   objective function to be minimized is the mass of the support structure.
   The model includes various design constraints: local and global
   buckling, modal frequencies, and fatigue damage along different stations
   of the structure. To show the usefulness of the method, an existing
   SWT-3.6-107 offshore wind turbine where its tower and foundation are
   designed separately is used as a case study. The result of the
   integrated multidisciplinary design optimization shows 12.1\% reduction
   in the mass of the support structure, while satisfying all the design
   constraints.}},

Title = {{Design Ethnography in Capstone Design: Investigating Student Use and
   Perceptions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{888-900}},
Abstract = {{In today's global markets engineers need to design products for a wide
   variety of stakeholders and cultures. Engineering students, therefore,
   must learn how to design products that meet the needs of the
   stakeholders and are appropriate for the cultures in which they will be
   used. Human-centered design guides students in developing design ideas
   that achieve this goal. This approach has proven to support innovation,
   increase product uptake, reduce errors, and focus the design on the user
   experience in addition to product functionality. Design ethnography is
   an important component of human-centered design and has been shown to be
   effective for understanding the true, and sometimes hidden, wants and
   needs of stakeholders and for informing design decisions. While the
   utility of design ethnography has been promoted within business and
   product innovation literature, student learning of design ethnography
   techniques has lacked study. This exploratory study sought to address
   this gap by characterizing the ways students use design ethnography
   methods during a capstone design experience as well as their perceptions
   of these methods within their design projects. Design report documents
   and semi-structured interviews were used to explore student practices
   and perceptions. Students used various design ethnography techniques
   including interviews (both structured and semi-structured), informal
   conversations, observations, and surveys. These were used throughout the
   design process (from problem definition to testing and validation),
   however, the methods were most frequently used when defining the
   problem, developing user requirements, and translating these into
   engineering specifications. Although there were numerous instances of
   successful uses of design ethnography, the focus of this study was on
   obstacles encountered when implementing these techniques to inform their
   design decisions. Semi-structured interviews revealed that students
   perceived both benefits of and frustrations with using design
   ethnography. However, the benefits that students perceived were often
   superficial in nature and the frustrations they encountered often
   stemmed from the challenges associated with open-ended problem solving.
   The results illustrate the need for the development of effective tools
   and pedagogy to support students when learning and practicing design
   ethnography.}},

Abstract = {{Miniaturized low-power implementation of a vision system is critical in
   battery-operated systems such as wireless sensor network (WSN),
   micro-air-vehicles (MAV), and mobile phones. Conventional
   digital-intensive processing uses the raw image with huge redundancy
   which degrades the power and speed. This paper reports multi-level
   mixed-mode processing schemes for efficient VLSI implementation in terms
   of power, area and speed. In this approach, the processing is
   distributed in pixel-level, column-level and chip-level processors. Each
   processor operates in mixed-mode, analog and digital, domains for an
   optimal use of resources. Three vision chips have been designed and
   characterized to show the effectiveness of this approach. First, motion
   detection and feature extraction are implemented in an object-adaptive
   CMOS image sensor to remove temporal and spatial redundancies for low
   power operation. Second, a neuromorphic algorithm is implemented for
   optic flow generation in mixed-mode circuits. Event-driven analog
   processing units allow low power operation of preprocessing, while the
   digital processor provides the robustness of backend processing.
   Finally, background light subtraction is implemented in a 3-D camera for
   outdoors mobile applications. The reconfigurable pixel array implemented
   by pixel-merging and super-resolution could achieve faster processing
   and better background light suppression.}},

   controller has been implemented to reduce the effective TCF of the fused

   used to mitigate offset errors caused by non-ideal temperature sensing.
   By effectively removing the offset errors, the frequency drift of an
   oscillator using a silica micromechanical resonator is reduced to less

   consumption to ovenize the entire platform consisting of four resonators

Abstract = {{We show a Field-Programmable Analog Array complemented with
   post-processed memristors (FPAA/memristor hybrid circuit), and present
   it as a platform for analog signal processing. The FPAA is fabricated on
   CMOS and uses floating-gate transistors (FGT) to realize programmable
   wiring fabrics and analog computing resources. The memristors,
   post-processed on top of the FPAA, are analog, which means that their
   conductance can be programmed in a continuous fashion. We highlight the
   key differences between FGTs and memristors, and discuss how analog
   signal processing tasks could be divided between them. Experimental
   results of the FPAA-memristor hybrid circuit are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the hydrogen and ethane
   production from cassava wastewater by using a two stage upflow anaerobic
   sludge blanket (UASB) system under thermophillic operation (55 degrees
   C). The recycle ratio of the effluent from the methane bioreactor-to-the
   feed flow rate was fixed at 1:1 and the solution pH in the hydrogen
   bioreactor was maintained at 5.5 by a pH controller while the solution
   pH of the methane bioreactor was not controlled. The liquid working
   volumes of the hydrogen and methane bioreactors were 4 and 24 L,
   respectively. The two stage UASB system was operated at different COD
   loading rates (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 kg/m(3)d based on the hydrogen
   bioreactor volume). Under the optimum COD loading rate of 90 kg/m(3)d
   based on the hydrogen bioreactor volume corresponding to 15 kg/m(3)d
   based on the methane bioreactor volume for the hydrogen bioreactor, the
   produced gas contained 40 \% H-2, 52 \% CO2 and 8 \% CH4 and the system
   provided a maximum hydrogen yield and specific hydrogen production rate
   of 18 mL/g COD removed and 520 mL/L d, respectively. Under this optimum
   COD loading rate, the produced gas of the methane bioreactor contained
   65 \% CH4 and 35 \% CO2 without hydrogen and the system provided a
   maximum methane yield and specific methane production rate of 115 mL/g
   COD removed and 650 mL/L d, respectively. The operation of recycling
   from methane bioreactor to hydrogen bioreactor optimized the use of NaOH
   for pH control in the hydrogen production step.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of networked systems with delayed coupling are analyzed in
   this paper. Two theorems are stated which give conditions for
   decomposability of the dynamics in the vicinity of cluster states based
   on the intracluster and intercluster connectivity. Moreover, a
   decomposition method is presented that allows the derivation of delayed
   modal equations about cluster states even when heterogeneity is
   introduced into the linearized system due the nonlinearities in the
   coupling. Analytical tools are applied to these modal equations to
   derive exact stability conditions: the D-subdivision method is used to
   study the stability of equilibria, while the stability of periodic
   orbits is investigated using Floquet theory. The coexistence of multiple
   stable and unstable steady and oscillatory cluster states is
   investigated in a system of type II neurons where weakly and strongly
   asymmetric cluster oscillations are discovered.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of multicore processors and system-on-chip designs,
   intra-chip communication demands have exacerbated, leading to a growing
   adoption of scalable networks-on-chip (NoCs) as the interconnect fabric.
   Today, conventional NoC designs may consume up to 30\% of the entire
   chip's power budget, in large part due to leakage power. In this work,
   we address this issue by proposing Panthre: our solution deploys
   power-gating to provide long intervals of uninterrupted sleep to
   selected units. Packets that would normally use power-gated components
   are steered away via topology and routing reconfiguration, while Panthre
   provides low-latency alternate paths to their destinations. The routing
   reconfiguration operates in a distributed fashion and guarantees that
   deadlock-free routes are available at all times. At runtime, Panthre
   adapts to the application's communication patterns by updating its
   power-gating decisions. It employs a feedback-based distributed
   mechanism to control the amount of sleeping components and of packets
   detours, so that performance degradation is kept at a minimum. Our
   design is flexible, providing a mechanism that designers can use to
   tradeoff power savings with performance, based on application's
   requirements.
   Our experiments on multi-programmed communication-light workloads from
   the SPEC CPU2006 suite show that Panthre reduces total network power
   consumption by 14.5\% on average, with only a 1.8\% degradation in
   performance, when all processor nodes are active. At times when 15-25\%
   of the processor cores are communication-idle, Panthre enables leakage
   power savings of 36.9\% on average, while still providing connected and
   deadlock-free routes for all other nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Separable allocators in on-chip routers perform switch allocation in two
   stages that often make uncoordinated decisions resulting in suboptimal
   switch allocation. We propose Virtual Input Crossbars (VIX), where more
   than one virtual channel (VC) of an input port is connected to the
   crossbar. VIX improves switch allocation by allowing more than one input
   VC of an input port to transmit flits in the same cycle. Also, more
   input VCs can participate in the output arbitration, reducing the
   chances of uncoordinated decisions. VIX improves network throughput by
   more than 15\% for the topologies studied without affecting the router
   critical path.}},

   magnetron, and planar magnetron, with respect to the equilibrium,
   stability, and operating conditions. This renewed interest was prompted
   by our recent invention of the recirculating planar magnetron (RPM),
   where rapid startup utilizes the negative mass instability in the
   inverted magnetron configuration. Given that Brillouin flow is the most
   likely state in a crossed-field gap, and that various embodiments of the
   RPM consist of the conventional, inverted, and planar magnetron, it is
   necessary to study equilibrium, stability, and operating conditions at
   the same footing. To study startup, we solve the eigenvalue problem that
   governs the stability of Brillouin flow, including the effects of the
   resonant cavities that form the slow wave structures.}},

Title = {{Evaluating Indirect Subthalamic Nucleus Targeting with Validated 3-Tesla

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{92}},

Abstract = {{Background/Objectives: Indirect targeting of the subthalamic nucleus
   (STN) is commonly utilized at deep brain stimulation (DBS) centers
   around the world. The superiority of either midcommissural point
   (MCP)-based or red nucleus (RN)-based indirect targeting remains to be
   established. Methods: The location of the STN was determined and
   statistically compared to MCP-and RN-based predictions in 58 STN DBS
   patients, using a validated 3-tesla MRI protocol. The influence of
   additional neuroanatomical parameters on STN midpoint location was
   evaluated. Linear regression analysis was utilized to produce an
   optimized MCP/RN targeting model. Targeting coordinates at 1.5 T were
   compared to results at 3 T. Results: Accuracy and precision for RN-based
   targeting was superior to MCP-based targeting to predict STN midpoint
   location for each coordinate dimension (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05,
   respectively). RN-based targeting was statistically equivalent to an
   optimized regression-based targeting strategy incorporating multiple
   neuroanatomical parameters, including third-ventricle width and overall
   brain size. RN-based targeting at 1.5 T yielded equivalent coordinates
   to targeting at 3 T. Conclusions: RN-based targeting is statistically
   superior to MCP-based STN targeting and accommodates broad variations in
   neuroanatomical parameters. Neurosurgeons utilizing indirect targeting
   of the STN may consider favoring RN-based over MCP-based indirect
   targeting methods. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{A phenomenological model of the bulk force exerted by a lithium ion cell
   during various charge, discharge, and temperature operating conditions
   is developed. The measured and modeled force resembles the carbon
   expansion behavior associated with the phase changes during
   intercalation, as there are ranges of state of charge (SOC) with a
   gradual force increase and ranges of SOC with very small change in
   force. The model includes the influence of temperature on the observed
   force capturing the underlying thermal expansion phenomena. Moreover the
   model is capable of describing the changes in force during thermal
   transients, when internal battery heating due to high C-rates or rapid
   changes in the ambient temperature, which create a mismatch in the
   temperature of the cell and the holding fixture. It is finally shown
   that the bulk force model can be very useful for a more accurate and
   robust SOC estimation based on fusing information from voltage and force
   (or pressure) measurements. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS.

Abstract = {{The coupling of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and excitons
   in nanomaterials can improve the performance of nano-optoelectronic
   devices. We synthesized a quantum dot (QD) capped gold (Au) nanoparticle
   (NP) composite to use as an emitting layer in all-inorganic quantum dot
   light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs). The photoluminescence (PL) peak of the
   QDs is fully overlapped with the absorption peak of the Au NPs to
   realize the maximum LSPR enhancement. The LSPR effect of the QD-capped
   Au NPs has been demonstrated by increased radiative emission, PL
   excitation intensity, and reduced exciton lifetime evidenced by
   time-resolved PL measurement. As a result, a quantum yield of 60\% for
   the QD-capped Au NPs has been realized and the QD-LED has achieved a
   remarkably enhanced power efficiency of 6.2 lm W-1 and maximum
   brightness of 1005 cd m(-2) under various optimization conditions. These
   results demonstrate that QD-capped Au NPs constitute an effective route
   for achieving high-performance optoelectronic devices.}},

   edge removals and features distributed computations via the associated
   graph Laplacian matrix. We prove that LFVC can be related to a monotonic
   submodular set function that guarantees that greedy node or edge
   removals come within a factor 1-1/e of the optimal non-greedy batch
   removal strategy. Due to the close relationship between graph topology
   and community structure, we use LFVC to detect deep and overlapping
   communities on real-world social network datasets. The results offer new
   insights on community detection by discovering new significant
   communities and key members in the network. Notably, LFVC is also shown
   to significantly outperform other well-known centralities for community
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{Speech patterns are modulated by the emotional and neurophysiological
   state of the speaker. There exists a growing body of work that
   computationally examines this modulation in patients suffering from
   depression, autism, and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, the
   majority of the work in this area focuses on the analysis of structured
   speech collected in controlled environments. Here we expand on the
   existing literature by examining bipolar disorder (BP). BP is
   characterized by mood transitions, varying from a healthy euthymic state
   to states characterized by mania or depression. The speech patterns
   associated with these mood states provide a unique opportunity to study
   the modulations characteristic of mood variation. We describe
   methodology to collect unstructured speech continuously and
   unobtrusively via the recording of day-to-day cellular phone
   conversations. Our pilot investigation suggests that manic and
   depressive mood states can be recognized from this speech data,
   providing new insight into the feasibility of unobtrusive, unstructured,
   and continuous speech-based wellness monitoring for individuals with BP.}},

Abstract = {{Aphasia is a common language disorder which can severely affect an
   individual's ability to communicate with others. Aphasia rehabilitation
   requires intensive practice accompanied by appropriate feedback, the
   latter of which is difficult to satisfy outside of therapy. In this
   paper we take a first step towards developing an intelligent system
   capable of providing feedback to patients with aphasia through the
   automation of two typical therapeutic exercises, sentence building and
   picture description. We describe the natural speech corpus collected
   from our interaction with clients in the University of Michigan Aphasia
   Program (UMAP). We develop classifiers to automatically estimate speech
   quality based on human perceptual judgment. Our automatic prediction
   yields accuracies comparable to the average human evaluator. Our feature
   selection process gives insights into the factors that influence human
   evaluation. The results presented in this work provide support for the
   feasibility of this type of system.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, major attention has been given to penalized log-likelihood
   estimators for sparse precision (inverse covariance) matrices. The
   penalty is responsible for inducing sparsity, and a very common choice
   is the convex l(1) norm. However, it is not always the case that the
   best estimator is achieved with this penalty. So, to improve sparsity
   and reduce biases associated with the l(1) norm, one must move to
   non-convex penalties such as the l(q) (0 <= q <= 1). In this paper we
   introduce the resulting non-concave l(q) penalized log-likelihood
   problem, and derive the corresponding optimality conditions. A novel
   cyclic descent algorithm is presented for penalized log-likelihood
   optimization, and we show how the derived conditions can be used to
   reduce algorithm computation. We illustrate by comparing reconstruction
   quality over the range 0 <= q <= 1 for several experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the advancements and challenges of minimum
   quantity lubrication (MQL) technology in automotive powertrain machining
   from both industrial and academic perspectives. MQL refers to applying a
   small amount of cutting fluid in the form of mist to the cutting zone
   rather than flooding the workpiece. Elimination of coolant systems
   creates significant saving from energy and equipment, the flexibility to
   relocate the machines, reduction of waste stream and floor space, and a
   cleaner and healthier work environment. Ford Motor Company has
   demonstrated these advantages, and currently has a total of over 400 MQL
   CNC machining centers in numerous global transmission and engine plants
   running MQL operations, with further implementation planned for new
   programs globally. Technical challenges to realize 100\% implementation
   includes tool design, delivery system, chip management, and thermal
   related problems, particularly in high-energy density processes and
   difficult-to-machine metals, such as deep-hole drilling and compacted
   graphite iron (CGI). This paper provides a review of current status and
   limitations of MQL machining and highlights opportunities for research
   and development of the next-generation MQL technology in automotive

Abstract = {{Linear motor drives (LMDs) are well known to provide significant
   advantages in terms of positioning speed and accuracy over traditional
   screw drives (SDs), making them better suited for high-speed
   high-precision machine tools. However, their use in such machine tools
   is severely limited by their tendency to consume a lot of electrical
   energy and cause thermal issues, particularly under high cutting loads.
   A hybrid feed drive (HFD) has recently been proposed as a possible
   solution to this dilemma. The HFD switches between LMD and SD actuation
   depending on the mode of the manufacturing operation, thus achieving
   speeds and accuracies similar to LMDs while consuming much less energy.
   This paper presents a comparative life cycle analysis (LCA) of the
   proposed HFD with an LMD as the baseline for the comparison. The
   functional unit is taken as the production of parts that involve heavy
   cutting by a small-sized 3-axis precision milling machine for 250 8-hour
   work days per year over a 12-year first-use life span. Energy savings
   provided by the HFD during its use phase vis-a-vis the additional energy

Abstract = {{An analytical approach for a dynamic cyber-security problem that
   captures progressive attacks to a computer network is presented. We
   formulate the dynamic security problem from the defender's point of view
   as a supervisory control problem with imperfect information, modeling
   the computer network's operation by a discrete event system. We consider
   a min-max performance criterion and use dynamic programming to
   determine, within a restricted set of policies, an optimal policy for
   the defender. We study and interpret the behavior of this optimal policy
   as we vary certain parameters of the supervisory control problem.}},

   algorithm that allows for cellular rewiring to establish dynamic
   regulatory networks based on activity of TF reporter constructs. We
   identified major hubs at various stages of culture associated with
   normal and abnormal tissue growth (i.e., ELK-1 and E2F1, respectively)
   and the mechanism of action for a targeted therapeutic, lapatinib,

Abstract = {{We achieve optofluidic lasers with a single molecular layer of gain, in
   which green fluorescent protein, dye-labeled bovine serum albumin, and
   dye-labeled DNA, are used as the gain medium and attached to the surface
   of a ring resonator via surface immobilization biochemical methods. It
   is estimated that the surface density of the gain molecules is on the
   order of 10(12) cm(-2), sufficient for lasing under pulsed optical
   excitation. It is further shown that the optofluidic laser can be tuned
   by energy transfer mechanisms through biomolecular interactions. This
   work not only opens a door to novel photonic devices that can be
   controlled at the level of a single molecular layer but also provides a
   promising sensing platform to analyze biochemical processes at the

Abstract = {{Optimized designs of the Navigation Doppler Lidar (NDL) instrument for
   Autonomous Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) were accomplished
   via Interdisciplinary Design Concept (IDEC) at NASA Langley Research
   Center during the summer of 2013. Three branches in the Engineering
   Directorate and three students were involved in this joint task through
   the NASA Langley Aerospace Research Summer Scholars (LARSS) Program. The
   Laser Remote Sensing Branch (LRSB), Mechanical Systems Branch (MSB), and
   Structural and Thermal Systems Branch (STSB) were engaged to achieve
   optimal designs through iterative and interactive collaborative design
   processes. A preliminary design iteration was able to reduce the power
   consumption, mass, and footprint by removing redundant components and
   replacing inefficient components with more efficient ones. A second
   design iteration reduced volume and mass by replacing bulky components
   with excessive performance with smaller components custom-designed for
   the power system. Thermal modeling software was used to run steady state
   thermal analyses, which were used to both validate the designs and
   recommend further changes. Analyses were run on each redesign, as well
   as the original system. Thermal Desktop was used to run trade studies to
   account for uncertainty and assumptions about fan performance and
   boundary conditions. The studies suggested that, even if the assumptions
   were significantly wrong, the redesigned systems would remain within
   operating temperature limits.}},

Abstract = {{From an economic point of view, the structural stability of
   noble-transition bimetallic catalysts is as significant as their
   well-studied catalytic efficiency. The structural evolution and
   corresponding dynamics of NiAu bimetallic nanoparticles under ambient
   conditions are investigated using in situ Cs-corrected STEM and DFT
   calculations. During oxidization, the Au component promotes dissociation
   of oxygen and initiates Ni oxidization, which simultaneously drives the
   migration of Au atoms, thus yielding multi-shell structures (denoted by
   Ni@Au@NiO). The subsequent hydrogen reduction induces surface
   reconstruction, forming fcc-NiAu clusters. After several cycles of
   catalyzing CO oxidization, both inverse Au segregation and Ni
   recrystallization occur, which are ascribed to exothermic excitation.
   The results of this study can help researchers understand the
   evolutionary behaviors of the bimetallic nanoparticles under ambient
   conditions as well as optimize the structural design of bimetallic
   catalysts.}},

Title = {{The next generation of low-cost personal air quality sensors for

Abstract = {{Advances in embedded systems and low-cost gas sensors are enabling a new
   wave of low-cost air quality monitoring tools. Our team has been engaged
   in the development of low-cost, wearable, air quality monitors (M-Pods)
   using the Arduino platform. These M-Pods house two types of sensors -
   commercially available metal oxide semiconductor (MOx) sensors used to
   measure CO, O-3, NO2, and total VOCs, and NDIR sensors used to measure
   CO2. The MOx sensors are low in cost and show high sensitivity near
   ambient levels; however they display non-linear output signals and have
   cross-sensitivity effects. Thus, a quantification system was developed
   to convert the MOx sensor signals into concentrations.
   We conducted two types of validation studies - first, deployments at a
   regulatory monitoring station in Denver, Colorado, and second, a user
   study. In the two deployments (at the regulatory monitoring station),
   M-Pod concentrations were determined using collocation calibrations and
   laboratory calibration techniques. M-Pods were placed near regulatory
   monitors to derive calibration function coefficients using the
   regulatory monitors as the standard. The form of the calibration
   function was derived based on laboratory experiments. We discuss various
   techniques used to estimate measurement uncertainties.
   The deployments revealed that collocation calibrations provide more
   accurate concentration estimates than laboratory calibrations. During
   collocation calibrations, median standard errors ranged between 4.0-6.1
   ppb for O-3, 6.48.4 ppb for NO2, 0.28-0.44 ppm for CO, and 16.8 ppm for
   CO2. Median signal to noise (S / N) ratios for the M-Pod sensors were
   higher than the regulatory instruments: for NO2, 3.6 compared to 23.4;
   for O-3, 1.4 compared to 1.6; for CO, 1.1 compared to 10.0; and for CO2,
   42.2 compared to 300-500. By contrast, lab calibrations added bias and
   made it difficult to cover the necessary range of environmental
   conditions to obtain a good calibration.
   A separate user study was also conducted to assess uncertainty estimates
   and sensor variability. In this study, 9 M-Pods were calibrated via
   collocation multiple times over 4 weeks, and sensor drift was analyzed,
   with the result being a calibration function that included baseline
   drift. Three pairs of M-Pods were deployed, while users individually
   carried the other three.
   The user study suggested that inter-M-Pod variability between paired
   units was on the same order as calibration uncertainty; however, it is
   difficult to make conclusions about the actual personal exposure levels
   due to the level of user engagement. The user study provided real-world
   sensor drift data, showing limited CO drift (under -0.05 ppm day(-1)),
   and higher for O-3 (-2.6 to 2.0 ppb day-1), NO2 (-1.56 to 0.51 ppb
   day(-1)), and CO2 (-4.2 to 3.1 ppm day(-1)). Overall, the user study
   confirmed the utility of the M-Pod as a low-cost tool to assess personal
   exposure.}},

Title = {{Study on high-Weber-number droplet collision by a parallel, adaptive
   interface-tracking method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{759}},
Abstract = {{We have established a parallel, adaptive interface-tracking framework in
   order to conduct, based on the framework, direct simulation of binary
   head-on droplet collision in the high-Weber-number regime (from 200 to
   1500) that exhibits complex topological changes and substantial length
   scale variations. The overall algorithms include a combined Eulerian and
   Lagrangian solver to track moving interfaces, conservative Lagrangian
   mesh modification and reconstruction, cell-based unstructured adaptive
   mesh refinement (AMR) in the Eulerian solver, and associated Eulerian
   and Lagrangian domain partitions to minimize communication overhead.
   Based on the combined computational and experimental efforts, we have
   resolved for the first time the free-surface instabilities of the
   colliding droplets at such high Weber number. We detail the
   characteristics of coalescence, stretch, end pinching, fingering,
   free-surface movement and drop breakup. The Taylor-Culick rim is present
   soon after the collision. Furthermore, we observe two types of
   longitudinal instabilities on the rim, namely, the Rayleigh-Taylor
   (RT)-type instability in the initial deceleration phase of the circular
   sheet right after droplet coalescence, and later the Rayleigh-Plateau
   (RP) instabilities. As the Taylor-Culick rim disintegrates in the
   retraction phase, fingering effect is profound and resulting in wider
   droplet size distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The use of a shroud around the rotor of a wind turbine has been known to
   augment the airflow through the rotor plane and hence result in improved
   performance. This work uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to assess
   the validity of several simple theories which attempt to extend Betz
   theory to shrouded turbines. Two CFD models are employed and compared to
   predictions of previously published models. The first makes use of a
   fixed pressure-drop actuator disk, while the second incorporates the
   twist and chord distribution of the turbine blade as well as an airfoil
   polar using a technique much like the classical blade element momentum
   (BEM) method. Calculations are performed for a sweep of turbine loadings
   using the fixed pressure-drop model and a sweep of tip speed ratios
   using the BEM model for both an open and shrouded turbine. Power is
   computed using a control volume approach for the fixed pressure-drop
   model and by integrating tangential forces for the BEM model.
   Information including mass flow ratio, power coefficient ratio, axial
   induction, and shroud force is extracted from the solution fields and
   compared against the predictions of low-order theories. Finally, the
   blade element model is used to redesign the turbine twist distribution
   to achieve greater performance across a range of tip speed ratios.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{9254-9259}},
Abstract = {{We report the effect of flow-induced dynamical heterogeneity on the
   nonlinear elastic modulus of weakly aggregated colloidal gels that have
   undergone yielding by an imposed step strain deformation. The gels are
   comprised of sterically stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate) colloids
   interacting through short-ranged depletion attractions. When a step
   strain of magnitude varying from gamma = 0.1 to 80.0 is applied to the
   quiescent gels, we observe the development of a bimodal distribution in
   the single-particle van Hove self-correlation function. This
   distribution is consistent with the existence of a fast and slow
   subpopulation of colloids within sheared gels. We evaluate the effect of
   incorporating the properties of the slow, rigid subpopulation of the
   colloids into a recent mode coupling theory for the nonlinear elasticity
   of colloidal gels.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},

Abstract = {{Research into the design of heparin and heparin-like/mimicking
   polymer-functionalized biomedical membranes is of tremendous interest to
   the biomedical sector in particular and is driven by potential diverse
   biomedical applications such as blood purification, artificial organs
   and other clinical medical devices. In this review, we highlight the
   progress of the recent research and propose potential biomedical
   applications in the fields of surface heparinization and the
   heparin-inspired modification of polymeric membranes. We summarize
   various surface heparinization strategies such as blending, surface
   coating, grafting, layer-by-layer assembly and mussel-inspired coating.
   Then, we classify the heparin-like/mimicking polymers and their
   applications in the design of heparin-mimicking biomedical membranes and
   draw some conclusions. The general concept of heparin-like/mimicking
   polymers is usually defined as heparan sulfates or synthetic
   sulfated/carboxylated polymers with comparable biologically mimicking
   functionalities as heparin, especially anticoagulant activity. Moreover,
   the potential biomedical applications and benefits of heparin and
   heparin-like/mimicking polymer-functionalized membranes in blood
   purification, artificial organs and tissue engineering are also
   discussed in each section. The heparin and heparin-like/mimicking
   polymer-functionalized membranes presented are exceptional candidates
   for the treatment of organ failure and many other blood-contacting
   fields. Finally, we conclude with the challenges and future perspectives
   for the strategies toward the heparinization and heparin-like/mimicking
   modification of membrane surfaces. It is believed that this review will
   evoke more attention towards the design of heparinized and
   heparin-like/mimicking membranes and encourage future advancements of
   this emerging research field.}},

Abstract = {{The technical challenges of managing the health of critical
   infrastructure systems necessitate greater structural sensing
   capabilities. Among these needs is the ability for quantitative, spatial
   damage detection on critical structural components. Advances in material
   science have now opened the door for novel and cost-effective spatial
   sensing solutions specially tailored for damage detection in structures.
   However, challenges remain before spatial damage detection can be
   realized. Some of the technical challenges include sensor installations
   and extensive signal processing requirements. This work addresses these
   challenges by developing a patterned carbon nanotube composite thin film
   sensor whose pattern has been optimized for measuring the spatial
   distribution of strain. The carbon nanotube-polymer nanocomposite
   sensing material is fabricated on a flexible polyimide substrate using a
   layer-by-layer deposition process. The thin film sensors are then
   patterned into sensing elements using optical lithography processes
   common to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies. The sensor
   array is designed as a series of sensing elements with varying width to
   provide insight on the limitations of such patterning and implications
   of pattern geometry on sensing signals. Once fabrication is complete,
   the substrate and attached sensor are epoxy bonded to a poly vinyl
   composite (PVC) bar that is then tested with a uniaxial, cyclic load
   pattern and mechanical response is characterized. The fabrication
   processes are then utilized on a larger-scale to develop and instrument
   a component-specific sensing skin in order to observe the strain
   distribution on the web of a steel beam. The instrumented beam is part
   of a larger steel beam-column connection with a concrete slab in
   composite action. The beam-column subassembly is laterally loaded and
   strain trends in the web are observed using the carbon nanotube
   composite sensing skin. The results are discussed in the context of
   understanding the properties of the thin film sensor and how it may be
   advanced toward structural sensing applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first documented investigation of a flow-induced
   vibration phenomenon referred to as dual cantilever flutter (DCF). First
   observations of DCF occurred unexpectedly in wind tunnel experiments
   where two identical cantilever beams began to experience flow-induced,
   large amplitude, persistent vibrations. These vibrations began when the
   two beams were placed in low velocity air flow (similar to 6 m/s) at a
   particular orientation relative to each other, and relative to the flow
   direction. This state of flow-induced vibration appeared to behave
   similar to the limit cycle oscillations caused by aeroelastic flutter.
   The purpose of this research is to introduce the concept of DCF and to
   help understand the key components that cause it. If unaccounted for,
   vibration caused by DCF has the potential to cause catastrophic
   structural damage or unwanted acoustic excitation. DCF may also be used
   as an effective energy harvesting method. An attractive feature of DCF
   for energy harvesting is that it provides a robust type of flow-induced
   excitation over a large range of flow velocity. This paper will present
   an experimental and analytical study on a novel, solid-state, DCF energy
   harvesting device. Results will include CFD simulations that were setup
   and executed using ANSYS-CFX.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of wireless telemetry into the design of monitoring and
   control systems has been shown to reduce system costs while simplifying
   installations. To date, wireless nodes proposed for sensing and
   actuation in cyber-physical systems have been designed using
   microcontrollers with one computational pipeline (i.e., single-core
   microcontrollers). While concurrent code execution can be implemented on
   single-core microcontrollers, concurrency is emulated by splitting the
   pipeline's resources to support multiple threads of code execution. For
   many applications, this approach to multi-threading is acceptable in
   terms of speed and function. However, some applications such as feedback
   controls demand deterministic timing of code execution and maximum
   computational throughput. For these applications, the adoption of
   multi-core processor architectures represents one effective solution.
   Multi-core microcontrollers have multiple computational pipelines that
   can execute embedded code in parallel and can be interrupted independent
   of one another. In this study, a new wireless platform named Martlet is
   introduced with a dual-core microcontroller adopted in its design. The
   dual-core microcontroller design allows Martlet to dedicate one core to
   standard wireless sensor operations while the other core is reserved for
   embedded data processing and real-time feedback control law execution.
   Another distinct feature of Martlet is a standardized hardware interface
   that allows specialized daughter boards (termed wing boards) to be
   interfaced to the Martlet baseboard. This extensibility opens
   opportunity to encapsulate specialized sensing and actuation functions
   in a wing board without altering the design of Martlet. In addition to
   describing the design of Martlet, a few example wings are detailed,
   along with experiments showing the Martlet's ability to monitor and
   control physical systems such as wind turbines and buildings.}},

Abstract = {{The piezoelectric impedance-based method for damage detection has been
   explored extensively for its high sensitivity to small-sized damages
   with low-cost measurement circuit which enables remote damage
   monitoring. While the method has good potential, the amount of feasible
   impedance data is usually much less than the number of required system
   parameters to accurately identify the damage location/severity via an
   inverse formulation. This data incompleteness forms a highly
   underdetermined problem and because of this numerical ill-conditioning,
   the predicted damage parameters will be significantly influenced by
   unavoidable measurement noise and the accuracy of the base-line model.
   In this study, the state of the art of impedance-based damage
   identification is advanced by incorporating a tunable piezoelectric
   circuitry with the structure to enrich the impedance measurements. This
   piezoelectric circuitry introduces additional degrees of freedom to the
   structure and changes the dynamics of the coupled system. By tuning the
   inductance value, it is possible to perform various measurements under
   different system dynamics which reflects the damage effect. Therefore,
   if performed systematically, notably increased sets of measurement can
   be obtained, which will improve the inverse problem to be less
   underdetermined. Clearly, we can expect the accuracy and robustness in
   damage identification to be significantly enhanced. Numerical case study
   on localizing damage in a fixed-fixed beam using spectral element method
   is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method for
   structural damage identification.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, carbon nanotube (CNT)-based thin films or
   nanocomposites have been widely investigated as a multifunctional
   material. The proposed applications extend beyond sensing, ultra-strong
   coatings, biomedical grafts, and energy harvesting, among others. In
   particular, thin films characterized by a percolated and random
   distribution of CNTs within a flexible polymeric matrix have been shown
   to change its electrical properties in response to applied strains.
   While a plethora of experimental work has been conducted, modeling their
   electromechanical response remains challenging. Furthermore, their
   design and optimization require the derivation of accurate
   electromechanical models that could predict thin film response to
   applied strains. Thus, the objective of this study is to implement a
   percolation-based piezoresistive model that could explain the underlying
   mechanisms for strain sensing. First, a percolation-based model with
   randomly distributed, straight CNTs was developed in MATLAB. Second, the
   number of CNTs within a unit area was varied to explore its influence on
   percolation probability. Then, to understand how the film's electrical
   properties respond to strain, two different models were implemented.
   Both models calculated the geometrical response of the film and CNTs due
   to applied uniaxial strains. The first model considered the fact that
   the electrical resistance of individual CNTs changed depending solely on
   its length between junctions. The other model further explored the idea
   of incorporating strain sensitivity of individual CNTs. The
   electromechanical responses and the strain sensitivities of the two
   models were compared by calculating how their bulk resistance varied due
   to applied tensile and compressive strains. The numerical model results
   were then qualitatively compared to experimental results reported in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study a transmission power-tune/control problem in the
   context of 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) with multiple
   (and possibly densely deployed) access points (APs). Previous studies on
   power control tend to focus on one aspect of the control, either its
   effect on transmission capacity (PHY layer) assuming simultaneous
   transmissions, or its effect on contention order (MAC layer) by
   maximizing spatial reuse. We observe that power control has a dual
   effect: it affects both spatial reuse and capacity of active
   transmission; moreover, maximizing the two separately is not always
   aligned in maximizing system throughput and can even point in opposite
   directions. In this paper we introduce an optimization formulation that
   takes into account this dual effect, by measuring the impact of transmit
   power on system performance from both PHY and MAC layers. We show that
   such an optimization problem is intractable and develop an analytical
   framework to construct simple yet efficient solutions. Through numerical
   results, we observe clear benefits of this dual-effect model compared to
   solutions by trying to maximize spatial reuse and transmission capacity
   separately. This problem does not invoke cross-layer design, as the only
   degree of freedom in design resides with transmission power. It however
   highlights the complexity in tuning certain design parameters, as the
   change may manifest itself differently at different layers which may be
   at odds.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed breakdowns of household energy consumption allow occupants to
   better understand their energy usage patterns and identify opportunities
   for energy savings. Current solutions are costly, invasive, and
   difficult to maintain. Sub-metering approaches rely on-and are hindered
   by-complex hardware. To address these problems, we demonstrate a
   sub-metering system that can estimate the power draw of individual loads
   by augmenting aggregate measurements with very simple sensors. These
   sensors wake up at a frequency proportional to the power draw of a
   neighboring load, and report these wakeups to a central server. We model
   the relationship between each sensor's wakeup frequency and the load's
   power draw as a monotonically increasing polynomial. We calibrate each
   sensor's function by constructing a linear least squares problem that
   allows us to discover the set of polynomial coefficients that minimize
   the difference between the estimated power draw and the power draw as
   derived from the aggregate measurements. After calibration, we can
   convert sensor wakeup frequencies to power draw in real time. This
   systems approach to sub-metering results in deployments that are easy to
   install and maintain, allowing users to gain a broad yet detailed view
   of their energy consumption and costs.}},

   within microbeads, and these structures became more prominent by day 14.
   Fibroblasts co-localized with endothelial cells, suggesting a
   pericyte-like function, and laminin deposition indicated maturation of
   the vessel networks over time. Microbeads embedded in a fibrin gel
   immediately after fabrication showed the emergence of cells and the
   coalescence of vessel structures in the surrounding matrix by day 7. By
   day 14, inosculation of neighboring cords and prominent vessel
   structures were observed. Microbeads pre-cultured for 7 days prior to
   embedding in fibrin gave rise to vessel networks that emanated radially
   from the microbead by day 7, and developed into connected networks by
   day 14. Lumen formation in endothelial cell networks was confirmed using
   confocal sectioning. These data show that collagen-fibrin composite
   microbeads support vascular network formation. Microbeads embedded
   directly after fabrication emulated the process of vasculogenesis, while
   the branching and joining of vessels from pre-cultured microbeads
   resembled angiogenesis. This modular microtissue system has utility in
   studying the processes involved in new vessel formation, and may be
   developed into a therapy for the treatment of ischemic conditions.}},

Title = {{A Poisson Cluster Stochastic Rainfall Generator That Accounts for the
   Interannual Variability of Rainfall Statistics: Validation at Various
   Geographic Locations across the United States}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{A novel approach for a Poisson cluster stochastic rainfall generator was
   validated in its ability to reproduce important rainfall and watershed
   response characteristics at 104 locations in the United States. The
   suggested novel approach, The Hybrid Model (THM), as compared to the
   traditional Poisson cluster rainfall modeling approaches, has an
   additional capability to account for the interannual variability of
   rainfall statistics. THM and a traditional approach of Poisson cluster
   rainfall model (modified Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulse model) were
   compared in their ability to reproduce the characteristics of extreme
   rainfall and watershed response variables such as runoff and peak flow.
   The results of the comparison indicate that THM generally outperforms
   the traditional approach in reproducing the distributions of peak
   rainfall, peak flow, and runoff volume. In addition, THM significantly
   outperformed the traditional approach in reproducing extreme rainfall by
   2.3\% to 66\% and extreme flow values by 32\% to 71\%.}},

Abstract = {{An important hallmark of many adult stem cell niches is their proximity
   to the vasculature in vivo, a feature common to neural stem cells
   (NSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow, adipose, and
   other tissues, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and many tumor stem
   cells. This review summarizes key studies supporting the vasculature's
   instructive role in adult stem cell niches, and the putative underlying
   molecular mechanisms by which blood vessels in these niches exert
   control over progenitor cell fates. The importance of the perivascular
   niche for pathology, notably tumor metastasis and dormancy, is also
   highlighted. Finally, the implications of the perivascular regulation of
   stem and progenitor cells on biomaterial design and the impact on future

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{87}},
Pages = {{46488-46493}},
Abstract = {{Chemiluminescence (CL) sensors can provide convenience and high
   sensitivity because they do not require an external excitation light
   source to produce a fluorescence signal. However, most CL based
   detection systems do not have a built-in self-signaling process, leading
   to inefficient and complex protocols due to the required multistep
   cascade reactions. Here, we develop a CL based sensory system with a
   built-in self-signaling feature by adapting the chemodosimeter concept.
   We found that a masking group incorporated to luminol efficiently
   suppresses the CL of luminol and that selective removal of the masking
   group by a target analyte can turn on the CL process, generating a
   sensitive fluorescence turn-on signal. Through systematic studies on
   newly devised TBS-luminol and TIPS-luminol, we optimized the molecular
   design parameters to achieve a highly sensitive and selective CL
   chemodosimeter. The optimized conditions rendered highly sensitive
   (Limit of Detection (LOD) = 18 nM) and selective fluoride sensing in
   aqueous environments. We anticipate that our new sensor system offers an
   efficient way to achieve highly sensitive, selective, and convenient CL
   turn-on detection of various important analytes.}},

   is examined using two types of PAA hydrogels (PAA1 and PAA2 with
   different inner structures, prepared by in situ cross-linked
   polymerization of monomer AA). The results indicated that the prepared
   PAA2/GO hydrogels exhibited a well-defined and interconnected 3D porous
   network, which allowed the adsorbate molecules to diffuse easily into
   the absorbent. The adsorption experiments indicated that the obtained
   interconnected polymeric composite hydrogels could efficiently remove
   cationic dyes and heavy metal ions from wastewater; the highest
   adsorption capacity of the prepared PAA2/GO composite hydrogels could
   reach as high as 1600 mg g(-)1, which is highly promising in the
   treatment of environmental toxins. Moreover, the initial concentration,
   pH value, desorption ratio, dynamic kinetics and isotherms of the
   methylene blue (MB) adsorption processes of the prepared PAA2/ GO
   composite hydrogels were also studied in detail. The experimental data
   of MB adsorption fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the
   Langmuir isotherm very well, and the adsorption process was controlled
   by the intraparticle diffusion. Moreover, due to its facile preparation
   and low-cost, the GO interpenetrated PAA composite hydrogels may
   function as promising adsorbents for wastewater treatment, and this
   method might also be extended to improve the adsorption capacity of
   other polymeric hydrogels.}},

   Here we show how reconfigurable clusters made of N colloidal particles
   bound flexibly to a central colloidal sphere have the capacity to store
   an amount of information that increases as O(N ln(N)). Using Brownian
   dynamics simulations, we predict dynamical regimes that allow for
   information to be written, saved, and erased. We experimentally assemble
   an N = 4 reconfigurable cluster from chemically synthesized colloidal
   building blocks, and monitor its equilibrium dynamics. We observe state
   switching in agreement with simulations. This cluster can store one bit
   of information, and represents the simplest digital colloid.}},

Title = {{Effective assessment of tyre-road friction coefficient using a hybrid
   estimator}},
Journal = {{VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1047-1065}},
Abstract = {{Vehicle stability and active safety control depend heavily on tyre
   forces available on each wheel of a vehicle. Since tyre forces are
   strongly affected by the tyre-road friction coefficient, it is crucial
   to optimise the use of the adhesion limits of the tyres. This study
   presents a hybrid method to identify the road friction limitation; it
   contributes significantly to active vehicle safety. A hybrid estimator
   is developed based on the three degrees-of-freedom vehicle model, which
   considers longitudinal, lateral and yaw motions. The proposed hybrid
   estimator includes two sub-estimators: one is the vehicle state
   information estimator using the unscented Kalman filter and another is
   the integrated road friction estimator. By connecting two sub-estimators
   simultaneously, the proposed algorithm can effectively estimate the road
   friction coefficient. The performance of the proposed estimation
   algorithm is validated in CarSim/Matlab co-simulation environment under
   three different road conditions (high-mu, low-mu and mixed-mu).
   Simulation results show that the proposed estimator can assess vehicle
   states and road friction coefficient with good accuracy.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{37}},
Pages = {{15437-15447}},
Abstract = {{We gain new insights into the equilibrium properties and potential
   two-phase lithiation mechanisms in LiFePO4 nano-particles by conducting
   a first-principles investigation of the anisotropic chemical interfacial
   energy landscape in LiFePO4. The chemical interfacial energy per unit
   area along the ac plane is found to be remarkably low (7 mJ m(-2)) with
   respect to the bc (115 mJ m(-2)) and ab (95 mJ m(-2)) chemical
   interfacial energies. Because chemical interfacial energy and coherency
   strain energy have different anisotropies, the thermodynamically stable
   interface orientation is shown to depend both on the particle size and
   on the particle morphology. In particular, ac interfaces are favored for
   isotropic particles below 40 nm. This indicates that, if
   experimentally-relevant nano-particles were to (de)lithiate under a
   thermodynamic two-phase mechanism, the resulting front would be
   orientated along the ac plane, and not along the bc plane as is assumed
   in most lithiation models in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The size of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) is crucial for their future
   application in the assembly of field emission (FE) devices. Ag-assisted
   chemical etching combined with PS sphere as template was employed to
   prepare size-controllable single crystal SiNWs with uniformity, and the
   diameter could be further reduced via dry oxidation. The FE properties
   were found to be strongly influenced by dimensionality and surface
   geometry structures, and improved progressively with the increase of
   proximity. The best FE properties were observed in the SiNWs with a tip
   size of similar to 180 nm (period 1000 nm) and a length of 3.2 mu m.
   They showed a low turn-on field of 1.8 V mu m-1 and a high current
   density of 0.75 mA cm(-2) at an electric field of 2.5 V mu m(-1). The
   emission current as a function of time test also demonstrated the good
   robustness of the SiNWs. The enhanced field emitting efficiency is
   attributed to the large space between neighboring nanowires, enhanced
   surface roughness and the sharp tips as hot emission spots.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of functional nanofibrous biomimetic scaffolds for tissue
   regeneration remains a challenge. This work demonstrates that functional
   nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated from blends of polylactide with
   other functional polymers by a thermally induced phase separation (TIPS)
   technique, here exemplified by the fabrication of electroactive
   nanofibrous scaffolds from the blends of polylactide and an
   electroactive degradable tetraaniline-polylactide-tetraaniline (TPT)
   block copolymer by TIPS. The TPT copolymer was synthesized by coupling
   reaction between the carboxyl-capped tetraaniline and polylactide. The
   chemical structure, electroactivity, thermal properties and mechanical
   properties of TPT and polylactide/TPT blend films were characterized.
   The copolymer blends were fabricated into electroactive nanofibrous
   scaffolds by TIPS. The effect of aniline tetramer content, polymer
   concentration and phase separation temperature on the diameter of
   nanofibers was investigated. The adhesion and proliferation of C2C12
   myoblast cells and protein adsorption on the electroactive biodegradable
   substrates were evaluated, and the results show that the electroactive
   materials are nontoxic and could enhance the C2C12 cell proliferation
   without electrical stimulation, and adsorbed more proteins compared to
   polylactide. The electrical stimulation on the electroactive substrates
   significantly increased the cell proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts. This
   work opens the way to fabricate functional nanofibrous scaffolds from
   the blends of polylactide and other functional polymers by TIPS.}},

   hexagonal mesh templates}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{10106-10112}},
Abstract = {{Arrays of small-diameter nanoparticles with high spatial order are
   useful for chemical and biological sensors, data storage, synthesis of
   nanowires and nanotubes, and many other applications. We show that
   self-ordered metal nanoparticle arrays can be formed by dewetting of
   thin films on hexagonal mesh substrates made of anodic aluminum oxide
   (AAO). Upon heating, the metal (Fe) film dewets onto the interstitial
   sites (i.e., the node points) between pores on the top surface of the
   AAO. We investigated the particle morphology and dynamics of dewetting
   using a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), grazing-incidence
   small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS), and numerical simulations.
   Templated metal particles are more monodisperse and have higher local
   order than those formed by the same dewetting process on flat, nonporous
   alumina. The degree of order depends on the initial film thickness, and
   for the optimal thickness tested (nominally 2 nm), we achieved uniform
   coverage and high order of the particles, comparable to that of the AAO
   template itself. Computational modeling of dewetting on templates with
   various pore order and size shows that the order of AAO pores is
   primarily influential in determining particle position and spacing,
   while the variance in pore size is less impactful. Potential uses of
   these ordered nanoparticle arrays on porous materials include plasmonic
   sensors and spatially controlled catalysts.}},

Title = {{Synthesis of gold and palladium nanoshells by in situ generation of
   seeds on silica nanoparticle cores}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{61}},
Pages = {{32283-32292}},
Abstract = {{This report describes the synthesis of silica-metal core-shell
   nanostructures by in situ generation of metal seeds on polyethyleneimine
   silane functionalized silica core surfaces eliminating the need for
   pre-synthesized metal seeds and a subsequent aging step, currently
   essential for synthesis of these materials. Specifically, gold
   nanoshells are generated on silica cores of two different sizes (similar
   to 150 and similar to 40 nm diameter), following this in situ seed
   generation method. In addition, an aqueous suspension of gold nanoshells
   with similar to 150 nm silica core and similar to 18 nm shell thickness
   shows characteristic photo-thermal properties with similar to 16 degrees
   C temperature change occurring from room temperature (25 degrees C)
   within similar to 10 minutes when exposed to an 808 nm wavelength laser.
   This in situ seed-mediated synthesis is further extended to palladium
   nanoshells (on a similar to 200 nm diameter silica core), and this paper
   reports for the first time the synthesis of palladium nanoshells from in
   situ generated palladium seeds on a silica core, unlike earlier reports
   of palladium nanoshell synthesis using solely gold nanoparticles as
   seeds to grow the final palladium shell. Different palladium shell
   thicknesses are generated by varying the concentration of seed-attached
   silica cores during the final synthesis step. For both gold and
   palladium nanoshell synthesis, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and
   transmission electron microscopy are used to follow the different steps
   of this synthesis process. The results demonstrate that this in situ
   seed generation method is effective for gold nanoshell synthesis with
   varying core sizes as well as being able to produce nanoshells with
   different metal overlays.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{61}},
Pages = {{32451-32456}},
Abstract = {{To date, it is still unclear why all mineral bridges linking neighboring
   platelets in various types of mollusk nacre have sizes of 10-50
   nanometers. We answer this question by investigating the strength of
   platelet-platelet interfaces and found that only when the mineral
   bridges have diameters of a few tens of nanometers can the interfaces
   achieve an optimal strength. It is the uniformity of stress
   distributions in the mineral bridges that dictates their characteristic
   sizes. The mechanism underlying interfacial optimization via mineral
   nanobridges simultaneously optimizes the load-bearing efficiency of the
   materials. This study provides inspirations for the biomimetic design of
   advanced composite materials.}},

   quantum cascade laser spectrometer (QCLS) operated during the HIPPO and
   CalNex airborne experiments. The QCLS made continuous 1 Hz measurements
   with 1 sigma Allan precisions of 20, 0.5, 0.09, and 0.15 ppb for CO2,
   CH4, N2O, and CO, respectively, over > 500 flight hours on 79 research
   flights. The QCLS measurements are compared to two vacuum ultraviolet
   (VUV) CO instruments (CalNex and HIPPO), a cavity ring-down spectrometer
   (CRDS) measuring CO2 and CH4 (CalNex), two broadband non-dispersive
   infrared (NDIR) spectrometers measuring CO2 (HIPPO), two onboard gas
   chromatographs measuring a variety of chemical species including CH4,
   N2O, and CO (HIPPO), and various flask-based measurements of all four
   species. QCLS measurements are tied to NOAA and WMO standards using an
   in-flight calibration system, and mean differences when compared to NOAA
   CCG flask data over the 59 HIPPO research flights were 100, 1, 1, and 2
   ppb for CO2, CH4, N2O, and CO, respectively. The details of the
   end-to-end calibration procedures and the data quality assurance and
   quality control (QA/QC) are presented. Specifically, we discuss our
   practices for the traceability of standards given uncertainties in
   calibration cylinders, isotopic and surface effects for the long-lived
   greenhouse gas tracers, interpolation techniques for in-flight
   calibrations, and the effects of instrument linearity on retrieved mole

Abstract = {{This chapter provides an overview of the Lambert W function approach.
   The approach has been developed for analysis and control of linear
   time-invariant time delay systems with a single known delay. A solution
   in the time-domain is given in terms of an infinite series, with the
   important characteristic that truncating the series provides a dominant
   solution in terms of the rightmost eigenvalues. A solution via the
   Lambert W function approach is first presented for systems of order one,
   then extended to higher order systems using the matrix Lambert W
   function. Free and forced solutions are used to investigate key
   properties of time-delay systems, such as stability, controllability and
   observability. Through eigenvalue assignment, feedback controllers and
   state-observers are designed. All of these can be achieved using the
   Lambert W function-based framework. The use of the MATLAB-based open
   source software in the LambertWDDE Toolbox is also introduced using
   numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of time delays on the nonlinear dynamics of neural networks
   are investigated. A decomposition method is utilized to derive modal
   equations that allow one to analyze the dynamics around synchronous
   states. The D-subdivision method is used to study the stability of
   equilibria while the stability of periodic orbits is investigated using
   Floquet theory. These methods are applied to a system of delay coupled
   Hodgkin-Huxley neurons to map out stable and unstable synchronous
   states. It is shown that for sufficiently strong coupling there exist
   delay ranges where stable equilibria coexist with stable oscillations
   which allow neural systems to respond to different environmental stimuli
   with different spatiotemporal patterns.}},

Title = {{Novel Pulse-width Modulation Strategy to Minimize the Switching Losses
   of Z-Source Inverters}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1213-1225}},
Abstract = {{This article proposes a novel pulse-width modulation strategy to
   minimize switching losses of the Z-source inverter. The Z-source
   inverter has different pulse-width modulation patterns unlike the
   conventional voltage source inverter. Shoot-through states have been
   inserted within the zero states of the traditional pulse-width
   modulation patterns of a voltage source inverter to boost DC input
   voltage. Thus, the Z-source inverter has six active states, two zero
   states, and additional shoot-through states differentiating the Z-source
   and conventional voltage source inverters. The currents flowing through
   the switches of the Z-source inverter are larger than those of the
   conventional voltage source inverter, because Z-network currents must
   flow through the switches during the shoot-through states. Therefore,
   shoot-through currents increase the total switching losses of the
   Z-source inverter. In this article, switching losses of the Z-source
   inverter with the existing pulse-width modulation strategy are analyzed
   in detail. Then, new modulation signals of the Z-source inverter are
   introduced to produce unique pulse-width modulation patterns that
   minimize the switching losses of the Z-source inverter. The switching
   losses of the Z-source inverter with both pulse-width modulation
   strategies are simulated and compared. In addition, an experimental
   system has been built and tested to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed strategy.}},

Title = {{Solar Energy Harvesting and Management in Wireless Sensor Networks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Wireless networks comprise of small devices that are typically deployed
   in environments where paucity of energy seriously restricts essential
   operations. The energy source of these devices decreases very quickly
   during continuous operation and it is pivotal to replace or recharge
   frequently the power sources. Sometimes, it is very difficult to perform
   these functions through conventional methods. One attractive solution to
   this problem is the use of the energy, scattered around us in the
   environment. The availability of energy from the environment is random
   and uncertain. In this paper, we present a model, schematically and
   analytically, for solar energy harvesting with appropriate energy
   management. We provide analysis and simulations for a solar cell for
   standard and different irradiance levels. The power of the storage
   device is also simulated for different times of the day. The proposed
   model not only scavenges the energy but also assures the connectivity of
   the network by optimizing the energy consumption.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2480-2489}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies maintenance policies for multi-component systems
   which have failure interaction among their components. Component failure
   might accelerate deterioration processes or induce instantaneous
   failures of the remaining components. We formulate this maintenance
   problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with an objective of
   minimising a total discounted maintenance cost. However, the action set
   and state space in MDP exponentially grow as the number of components
   increases. This makes traditional approaches computationally
   intractable. To deal with this curse of dimensionality, a modified
   iterative aggregation procedure (MIAP) is proposed. We mathematically
   prove that iterations in MIAP guarantee the convergence and the policy
   obtained is optimal. Numerical case studies find that failure
   interaction should not be ignored in a maintenance policy decision
   making and the proposed MIAP is faster and requires less computational
   memory size than that of linear programming.}},

Abstract = {{Fracture in Li-ion battery electrodes is one of the main degradation
   mechanisms that limit the battery performance and lifetime. Debonding
   between the active and binder materials damages mechanical integrity,
   which leads to the loss of active materials and increased resistance. In
   this work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is used to evaluate the
   strength of the connectivity between polyvinylindene fluoride (PVDF)
   binder and graphite in the opening and sliding modes. The simulations
   revealed detailed failure behaviors at the atomistic scale. We have
   found that the separation occurs at the interface rather than inside the
   bulk materials, suggesting that the mechanical strength at the interface
   between PVDF binder and graphite is weaker than that of PVDF Or
   graphite. Therefore, debonding at the interface is critical to the
   mechanical integrity of the electrode. Our calculation's have provided
   quantitative traction-separation curves, and identified the maximum
   stresses of 300 MPa and 30 MPa for the normal and shear traction curves,
   respectively. The traction-separation curves obtained from the MD
   simulations will provide the critical input for the continuum level
   cohesive zone model to further study the inter-particle crack
   propagation in the electrode. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All

   resulting aggregates are characterized by the number of CB particles
   connected to the percolated cluster of AM, which affects the effective
   conductivity. The effects of particle geometry and constituent mass
   ratio are investigated. It is found that a larger AM particle aspect
   ratio contributes positively to the percentage of CB attachment. For a

Journal = {{TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{866-874}},
Abstract = {{Objective: A series of sled tests was performed using vehicle seats and
   Hybrid-III 6-year-old (6YO) and 10YO anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs)
   to explore possibilities for improving occupant protection for children
   who are not using belt-positioning booster seats.
   Methods: Cushion length was varied from production length of 450 mm to a
   shorter length of 350 mm. Lap belt geometry was set to rear, mid, and
   forward anchorage locations that span the range of lap belt angles found
   in vehicles. Six tests each were performed with the 6YO and 10YO Hybrid
   III ATDs. One additional test was performed using a booster seat with
   the 6YO. The ATDs were positioned using an updated version of the
   University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) seating
   procedure that positions the ATD hips further forward with longer seat
   cushions to reflect the effect of cushion length on posture that has
   been measured with child volunteers. ATD kinematics were evaluated using
   peak head excursion, peak knee excursion, the difference between peak
   head and peak knee excursion, and the maximum torso angle.
   Results: Shortening the seat cushion improved kinematic outcomes,
   particularly for the 10YO. Lap belt geometry had a greater effect on
   kinematics with the longer cushion length, with mid or forward belt
   geometries producing better kinematics than the rearward belt geometry.
   The worst kinematics for both ATDs occurred with the long cushion length
   and rearward lap belt geometry. The improvements in kinematics from
   shorter cushion length or more forward belt geometry are smaller than
   those provided by a booster seat.
   Conclusions: The results show potential benefits in occupant protection
   from shortening cushion length and increasing lap belt angles,
   particularly for children the size of the 10YO ATD.}},

Abstract = {{Computer simulation is one of the most widely utilized tools for
   operational research in construction engineering and management.
   Although discrete event simulation (DES) has been extensively utilized
   in construction, system dynamics (SD) has received relatively little
   attention despite its great potential to address dynamic complexity in
   construction projects, which are inherently complex, dynamic and involve
   multiple feedback processes and non-linear relationships. This chapter
   introduces dynamic project management (DPM), an SD-based new
   construction project modeling approach, which has been successfully
   applied to deal with dynamic complexities in diverse infrastructure and
   building projects. Particularly, this chapter introduces three major
   theoretical foundations of DPM: a holistic approach, a system
   structure-oriented approach, and the incorporation of control time
   delays. This chapter is expected to serve as a useful guideline for the
   application of SD in construction and to contribute to expanding the
   current body of knowledge in construction simulation.}},

Abstract = {{The need for reduced power requirements for small electronic components,
   such as wireless sensor networks, has prompted interest in recent years
   for energy harvesting technologies capable of capturing energy from
   broadband ambient vibrations. Encouraging results have been reported for
   an arrangement of piezoelectric layers attached to carbon fiber / epoxy
   laminates which possess bistability by virtue of their specific
   asymmetric stacking sequence. The inherent bistability of the underlying
   structure is exploited for energy harvesting since a transition from one
   stable configuration to another, or `snap-through', is used to
   repeatedly strain the surface-bonded piezoelectric and generate
   electrical energy. Existing studies, both experimental and modelling,
   have been limited to simple geometric laminate shapes, restricting the
   scope for improved energy harvesting performance by limiting the number
   of design variables. In this paper we present an analytical model to
   predict the static shapes of laminates of any desired profile, validated
   experimentally using a digital image correlation system. Good accuracy
   in terms of out-of-plane displacements (5-7\%) are shown in line with
   existing square modelling results. The static model is then mapped to a
   dynamics model and used to compare results against an experimental study
   of the harvesting performance of an example arbitrary geometry
   piezoelectric-laminate energy harvester.}},

Abstract = {{The heaving of ocean waves is a largely untapped, renewable kinetic
   energy resource. Conversion of this energy into electrical power could
   integrate with solar technologies to provide for round-the-clock,
   portable, and mobile energy supplies usable in a wide variety of marine
   environments. However, the direct drive conversion methodology of
   grid-integrated wave energy converters does not efficiently scale down
   to smaller, portable architectures. This research develops an
   alternative power conversion approach to harness the extraordinarily
   large heaving displacements and long oscillation periods as an
   excitation source for an extendible vibration energy harvesting chain.
   Building upon related research findings and engineering insights, the
   proposed system joins together a series of dynamic cells through
   bistable interfaces. Individual impulse events are generated as the
   inertial mass of each cell is pulled across a region of negative
   stiffness to induce local snap through dynamics; the oscillating
   magnetic inertial mass then generates current in a coil which is
   connected to energy harvesting circuitry. It is shown that linking the
   cells into a chain transmits impulses through the system leading to
   cascades of vibration and enhancement of electrical energy conversion
   from each impulse event. This paper describes the development of the
   multistable chain and ways in which realistic design challenges were
   addressed. Numerical modeling and corresponding experiments demonstrate
   the response of the chain due to slow and large amplitude input motion.
   Lastly, experimental studies give evidence that energy conversion
   efficiency of the chain for wave energy conversion is much higher than
   using an equal number of cells without connections.}},

Abstract = {{The flexure-box morphing aileron concept utilizes Macro-Fiber Composites
   (MFCs) and a compliant box to create a conformal morphing aileron. This
   work evaluates the impact of the number of MFCs on the performance,
   power and mass of the aileron by experimentally investigating two
   different actuator configurations: unimorph and bimorph. Implemented in
   a NACA 0012 airfoil with 304.8 mm chord, the unimorph and bimorph
   configurations are experimentally tested over a range of flow speeds
   from 5 to 20 m/s and angles of attack from -20 to 20 degrees under
   aerodynamic loads in a wind tunnel. An embedded flexible sensor is
   installed in the aileron to evaluate the effect of aerodynamic loading
   on tip position. For both design choices, the effect of actuation on
   lift, drag and pitching moment coefficients are measured. Finally, the
   impact on aileron mass and average power consumption due to the added
   MFCs is considered. The results showed the unimorph exhibiting superior
   ability to influence flow up to 15 m/s, with equivalent power
   consumption and lower overall mass. At 20 m/s, the bimorph exhibited
   superior control over aerodynamic forces and the unimorph experienced
   significant deformation due to aerodynamic loading.}},
