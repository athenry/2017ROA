Abstract = {{We report the development of a near-field optical nanolithography method
   using a roll-type phase-shift mask. Sub-wavelength resolution is
   achieved using near-field exposure of photoresist through a cylindrical
   phase mask, allowing dynamic and high throughput continuous patterning.
   As an application, we present the fabrication of a transparent electrode
   in the form of a metallic wire grid by using the roller-based optical
   lithography method. To fabricate a mesh-type metal pattern, a specific
   phase-shift mask was designed and critical experimental parameters were
   also studied. As a result, a transparent conductor with suitable
   properties was achieved with a recently built cylindrical phase-shift
   lithography prototype designed to pattern on 100 mm(2) of substrate
   area.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report a new method to fabricate a wire grid polarizer

   pattern a high aspect ratio and narrow linewidth grating by nanoimprint
   lithography followed by two angled aluminum depositions in opposite
   directions to produce the narrow spacing between the aluminum lines
   required for a visible band WGP. Anisotropic reactive ion etching is
   used to remove the aluminum deposited at the top of the grating but
   leave the aluminum layer on the grating sidewalls, thereby forming a
   metal wire grid with much smaller spacings than a lithographically
   defined grating. As a result, the fabricated WGP showed good performance
   in a wide range of visible wavelength.}},

Abstract = {{Oximes are important in the treatment of organophosphate (OP) poisoning,
   but have limited biological half-lives. Complexing these drugs with a
   macromolecule, such as a dendrimer, could improve their
   pharmacokinetics. The present study investigates the intermolecular
   interactions that drive the complexation of oxime-based drug molecules
   with fifth generation poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers. We performed
   steady-state binding studies of two molecules, pralidoxime and
   obidoxime, employing multiple NMR methods, including 1D titration,
   H-1-H-1 2D spectroscopy (COSY, NOESY), and H-1 diffusion-ordered
   spectroscopy (DOSY). Several important insights were gained in
   understanding the host-guest interactions occurring between the drug
   molecules and the polymer. First, the guest molecules bind to the
   dendrimer macromolecule through a specific interaction rather than
   through random, hydrophobic encapsulation. Second, this specificity is
   driven primarily by the electrostatic or H-bond interaction of the oxime
   at a dendrimer amine site. Also, the average strength for each drug and
   dendrimer interaction is affected by the surface modification of the
   polymer. Third, individual binding events between oximes and a dendrimer
   have a negative cooperative effect on subsequent oxime binding. In
   summary, this report provides a novel perspective important for
   designing host systems for drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Several compositions of manganese tin bismuth selenide solid solution
   series, Mn1-xSnxBi2Se4 (x = 0, 0.3, 0.75), were synthesized by combining
   high purity elements in the desired ratio at moderate temperatures.
   X-ray single crystal studies of a Mn-rich composition (x = 0) and a
   Mn-poor phase (x = 0.75) at 100 and 300 K revealed that the compounds
   crystallize isostructurally in the monoclinic space group C2/m (no.12)
   and adopt the MnSb2Se4 structure type. Direct current (DC) magnetic
   susceptibility measurements in the temperature range from 2 to 300 K
   indicated that the dominant magnetic ordering within the Mn1-xSnxBi2Se4
   solid-solutions below SO K switches from antiferromagnetic (AFM) for
   MnBi2Se4 (x = 0), to ferromagnetic (FM) for Mn0.7Sn0.3Bi2Se4 (x = 0.3),
   and finally to paramagnetic (PM) for Mn0.25Sn0.75Bi2Se4 (x = 0.75). We
   show that this striking variation in the nature of magnetic ordering
   within the Mn1-xSnxBi2Se4 solid-solution series can be rationalized by
   taking into account: (1) changes in the distribution of magnetic centers
   within the structure arising from the Mn to Sn substitutions, (2) the
   contributions of spin-polarized free charge carriers resulting from the
   intermixing of Mn and Sn within the same crystallographic site, and (3)
   a possible long-range ordering of Mn and Sn atoms within individual
   \{M\}(n)Se4n+2 single chain leading to quasi isolated \{MnSe6\}
   octahedra spaced by nonmagnetic \{SnSe6\} octahedra.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) differ from ideal inorganic solar cells due
   to their pronounced voltage dependence under reverse bias. This feature
   is commonly modeled in an ad hoc fashion by including a parallel
   junction resistance (R-p) that bypasses the heterojunction energy
   barrier between donor and acceptor. The existence of a finite R-p has
   variously been attributed to rough interfaces, pinhole defects, or to
   the electric field dependence of the dissociation of polaron pairs that
   are bound at the heterojunction. Here we show that the voltage
   dependence of the photocurrent can also arise from photoconductivity
   resulting from exciton generation followed by dissociation into free
   polarons within the bulk of the donor and acceptor layers. The presence
   of photoconductivity of the active layers does not result in an increase
   in power conversion efficiency, and places a constraint on the maximum
   fill factor that can be achieved in an OPV cell.}},

Abstract = {{20 wt.\% hydroxyapatite/Ti composite coatings were fabricated via an
   in-house developed argon atmospheric plasma spraying (AAPS) system on Ti
   substrates. The phase and morphologies of the coatings were identified
   by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The
   electrochemical corrosion behavior of the coatings was evaluated in a
   simulated biomedical environment by using potentiodynamic polarization
   and electrochemical impedance spectroscope techniques. The bioactivity
   of the composite coatings was studied by immersing the coatings in
   simulated body fluid (SBF) for up to 8 months. The mechanical properties
   such as microhardness, friction and bonding strength were also
   investigated. Results demonstrate that dense composite coatings with a
   typical morphology of HAP homogenously distributed in Ti matrix are
   obtained and the decomposition of HAP during plasma spraying process is
   avoided. The bonding strength is significantly higher than that of HAP
   or Ti reinforced HAP coatings and the frictional property is comparable
   to Ti substrate. A relatively higher corrosion current of HAP/Ti
   composite than that of pure Ti coating in simulated body fluid indicates
   a good bioactivity for composite coating, which is also testified by the
   formation of apatite layer in vitro test. After eight months immersion,
   a thick, tortoise-shell like apatite layer covered the entire top
   surface of composite coating. The study indicates the potential of AAPS
   deposited HAP/Ti composites as load bearing implant materials. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We study numerically the steady creeping motion of Bingham liquid plugs
   in two-dimensional channels as a model of mucus behaviour during airway
   reopening in pulmonary airways. In addition to flow analysis related to
   propagation of the plug, the stress distribution on the wall is studied
   for better understanding of potential airway epithelial cell injury
   mechanisms. The yield stress behaviour of the fluid was implemented
   through a regularized constitutive equation. The capillary number, Ca,
   and the Bingham number, Bn, which is the ratio of the yield stress to a
   characteristic viscous stress, varied over the ranges 0.025-0.1 and
   0-1.5, respectively. For the range of parameters studied, it was found
   that, while the yield stress reduces the magnitude of the shearing along
   the wall, it can magnify the amplitude of the wall shear stress gradient
   significantly, and also it can elevate the magnitude of the wall shear
   stress and wall pressure gradient up to 30 \% and 15 \%, respectively.
   Therefore, the motion of mucus plugs can be more damaging to the airway
   epithelial cells due to the yield stress properties of mucus. The yield
   stress also modifies the profile of the plug where the amplitude of the
   capillary waves at the leading meniscus decreases with increase in Bn.
   Other findings are that: the thickness of the static film increases with
   increasing Bn; the driving pressure difference increases linearly with
   Bn; and increasing Bn extends any wall stagnation point beneath the
   leading meniscus to an unyielded line segment beneath the leading
   meniscus. With an increase in Bn, the unyielded areas appear and grow in
   the adjacent wall film as well as the core region of the plug between
   the two menisci. The plug length, L-p, mostly modifies the topology of
   the yield surfaces. It was found that the unyielded area in the core
   region between the two menisci grows as the plug length decreases. The
   very short Bingham plug behaves like a solid lamella. In all computed
   liquid plugs moving steadily, the von Mises stress attains its maximum
   value near the interface of the leading meniscus in the transition
   region. For Bingham plugs moving very slowly, Ca -> 0, the driving
   pressure is non-zero.}},

Title = {{Characterization of Oxidation and Reduction of Pt-Ru and Pt-Rh-Ru Alloys
   by Atom Probe Tomography and Comparison with Pt-Rh}},

Abstract = {{Pt-based alloys containing Rh and Ru are effective catalysts in a range
   of applications, including pollution control and low-temperature fuel
   cells. As the Pt group metals are generally rare and expensive,
   minimizing the loading of them while also increasing the efficiency of
   catalyst materials is a continual challenge in heterogeneous catalysis.
   A smart method to ``nanoengineer{''} the surface of the nanocatalyst
   particles would greatly aid this goal. In our study, the oxidation of a
   Pt-8.9 at. \% Ru alloy between 773 and 973 K and the oxidation and
   oxidation/reduction behavior of a Pt-23.9 at. \% Rh-9.7 at. \% Ru alloy
   at 873 K for various exposure times were studied using atom probe
   tomography. The surface of the Pt-Ru alloy is enriched with Ru after
   oxidation at 773 K, whereas it is depleted in Ru at 873 K, and at 973 K.
   The surface oxide layer vanishes at higher temperatures, leaving behind
   a Pt-rich surface. In the case of the Pt-Rh-Ru alloy, oxidation
   initiates from the grain boundaries, forming an oxide With a
   stoichiometry of MO2. As the oxidation time increases, this oxide
   evolves into a two-phase nanostructure, involving a Rh-rich oxide phase
   (Rh, Ru)(2)O-3 and a Ru-rich oxide phase (Ru, Rh)O-2. When this
   two-phase oxide is reduced in hydrogen at low temperatures, separate
   Rh-rich and Ru-rich nanoscale regions remain. This process could,
   therefore, be useful for synthesizing complex island structures on
   Pt-Rh-Ru nanoparticle catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{The bacterial community structure of a drinking water microbiome was
   characterized over three seasons using 16S rRNA gene based
   pyrosequencing of samples obtained from source water (a mix of a
   groundwater and a surface water), different points in a drinking water
   plant operated to treat this source water, and in the associated
   drinking water distribution system. Even though the source water was
   shown to seed the drinking water microbiome, treatment process
   operations limit the source water's influence on the distribution system
   bacterial community. Rather, in this plant, filtration by dual media
   rapid sand filters played a primary role in shaping the distribution
   system bacterial community over seasonal time scales as the filters
   harbored a stable bacterial community that seeded the water processes
   past filtration. Bacterial taxa that colonized the filter and sloughed
   off in the filter effluent were able to persist in the distribution
   system despite disinfection of finished water by chloramination and
   filter backwashing with chloraminated backwash water. Thus, filter
   colonization presents a possible ecological survival strategy for
   bacterial communities in drinking water systems, which presents an
   opportunity to control the drinking water microbiome by manipulating the
   filter microbial community. Grouping bacterial taxa based on their
   association with the filter helped to elucidate relationships between
   the abundance of bacterial groups and water quality parameters and
   showed that pH was the strongest regulator of the bacterial community in
   the sampled drinking water system.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographic (GC x GC)
   separations by use of a microfabricated midpoint thermal modulator (mu
   TM) are demonstrated, and the effects of various mu TM design and
   operating parameters on performance are characterized. The two-stage mu
   TM chip consists of two interconnected spiral etched-Si microchannels
   (4.2 and 2.8 cm long) with a cross section of 250 x 140 mu m(2), an
   anodically bonded Pyrex cap, and a cross-linked wall coating of
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Integrated heaters provide rapid,
   sequential heating of each mu TM stage, while a proximate, underlying
   thermoelectric cooler provides continual cooling. The first-dimension
   column used for GC x GC separations was a 6 m long, 250 mu m id.
   capillary with a PDMS stationary phase, and the second-dimension column
   was a 0.5 m long, 100 mu m i.d. capillary with a poly(ethylene glycol)
   phase. Using sets of five to seven volatile test compounds (boiling
   point less than or similar to 174 degrees C), the effects of the minimum
   (T-min) and maximum (T-max) modulation temperature, stage heating
   lag/offset (O-s), modulation period (P-M), and volumetric flow rate (F)
   on the quality of the separations were evaluated with respect to several
   performance metrics. Best results were obtained with a T-min = -20
   degrees C, T-max. = 210 degrees C, O-s = 600 ms, P-M = 6 s, and F = 0.9
   mL/min. Replicate modulated peak areas and retention times were
   reproducible to <5\%. A structured nine-component GC x GC chromatogram
   was produced, and a 21 component separation was achieved in <3 min. The
   potential for creating portable mu GC x mu GC systems is discussed.}},

   four prototypical metal organic frameworks (MOFs) containing
   coordinatively unsaturated metal sites: M/DOBDC (M = Mg, Ni, and Co) and
   Cu-HKUST-1. Although the LDA and GGA functionals partially capture
   trends, they significantly overbind (LDA) and underbind (GGA) CO2 with
   respect to the experimental enthalpies. The addition of a semiempirical
   r(-6) dispersion term to the GGA exchange-correlation energy using ``off
   the shelf{''} DFT-D2 parameters results in a substantial improvement
   both in trends and in the magnitude of the adsorption enthalpies.
   However, on average this approach still underbinds CO2 as compared to
   the experimental data by similar to 7 kJ/mol (18\%). Better accuracy is
   obtained with some of the nonempirical vdW density functionals, with the
   revPBE-based functional of Dion et al. {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 2004, 92,
   246401] yielding an average error of only similar to 2 kJ/mol (4\%)
   relative to experiment. This improvement in energetics is accompanied by
   a slight decrease in the accuracy of predicted structures, as the revPBE
   functional overestimates the metal-CO2 bond length by about 10\%. The
   identification of an efficient vdW density functional capable of
   predicting the thermodynamics of CO2 ;adsorption will facilitate rapid
   computational screening for optimal CO2 adsorbents.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{As 16S rRNA gene targeted massively parallel sequencing has become a
   common tool for microbial diversity investigations, numerous advances
   have been made to minimize the influence of sequencing and chimeric PCR
   artifacts through rigorous quality control measures. However, there has
   been little effort towards understanding the effect of multi-template
   PCR biases on microbial community structure. In this study, we used
   three bacterial and three archaeal mock communities consisting of,
   respectively, 33 bacterial and 24 archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences
   combined in different proportions to compare the influences of (1)
   sequencing depth, (2) sequencing artifacts (sequencing errors and
   chimeric PCR artifacts), and (3) biases in multi-template PCR, towards
   the interpretation of community structure in pyrosequencing datasets. We
   also assessed the influence of each of these three variables on alpha-
   and beta-diversity metrics that rely on the number of OTUs alone
   (richness) and those that include both membership and the relative
   abundance of detected OTUs (diversity). As part of this study, we
   redesigned bacterial and archaeal primer sets that target the V3-V5
   region of the 16S rRNA gene, along with multiplexing barcodes, to permit
   simultaneous sequencing of PCR products from the two domains. We
   conclude that the benefits of deeper sequencing efforts extend beyond
   greater OTU detection and result in higher precision in beta-diversity
   analyses by reducing the variability between replicate libraries,
   despite the presence of more sequencing artifacts. Additionally,
   spurious OTUs resulting from sequencing errors have a significant impact
   on richness or shared-richness based alpha- and beta-diversity metrics,
   whereas metrics that utilize community structure (including both
   richness and relative abundance of OTUs) are minimally affected by
   spurious OTUs. However, the greatest obstacle towards accurately
   evaluating community structure are the errors in estimated mean relative
   abundance of each detected OTU due to biases associated with
   multi-template PCR reactions.}},

Pages = {{5512-5523}},

Abstract = {{Interannual variability of precipitation can directly or indirectly
   affect many hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes that,
   in turn, influence climate. Despite the significant importance of the
   phenomenon, few studies have attempted to elucidate spatial patterns of
   this variability at the global scale. This study uses land gauge
   precipitation records of the Global Historical Climatology Network,
   version 2, as well as reanalysis data to provide an assessment of the
   spatial organization of characteristics of precipitation interannual
   variability. The coefficient of variation, skewness, and short- and
   long-range dependence of the precipitation variability are analyzed.
   Among the major inferences is that the coefficient of variation of
   annual precipitation shows a significant correlation with intra-annual
   seasonality. Specifically, subyearly precipitation anomalies occurring
   in locations with pronounced seasonality affect the total yearly amount,
   imposing a higher variability in the annual precipitation fluctuations.
   Furthermore, the study illustrates that a positive skewness of the
   distribution of annual precipitation is a robust property worldwide and
   its magnitude is related to the coefficient of variation. Additionally,
   annual precipitation exhibits very weak small-lag autocorrelation.
   Conversely, the intensity of long-memory long-range dependence is
   significantly larger than zero, hinting that organized long-term
   variations are an important feature of the interannual variability of
   precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, we study various numerical aspects of higher-order
   finite-element discretizations of the non-linear saddle-point
   formulation of orbital-free density-functional theory. We first
   investigate the robustness of viable solution schemes by analyzing the
   solvability conditions of the discrete problem. We find that a staggered
   solution procedure where the potential fields are computed consistently
   for every trial electron-density is a robust solution procedure for
   higher-order finite-element discretizations. We next study the
   convergence properties of higher-order finite-element discretizations of
   orbital-free density functional theory by considering benchmark problems
   that include calculations involving both pseudopotential as well as
   Coulomb singular potential fields. Our numerical studies suggest close
   to optimal rates of convergence on all benchmark problems for various
   orders of finite-element approximations considered in the present study.
   We finally investigate the computational efficiency afforded by various
   higher-order finite-element discretizations, which constitutes the main
   aspect of the present work, by measuring the CPU time for the solution
   of discrete equations on benchmark problems that include large Aluminum
   clusters. In these studies, we use mesh coarse-graining rates that are
   derived from error estimates and an a priori knowledge of the asymptotic
   solution of the far-field electronic fields. Our studies reveal a
   significant 100-1000 fold computational savings afforded by the use of
   higher-order finite-element discretization, alongside providing the
   desired chemical accuracy. We consider this study as a step towards
   developing a robust and computationally efficient discretization of
   electronic structure calculations using the finite-element basis. (C)

Abstract = {{Background. While the importance of fluid dynamical conditions is well
   recognized in the growth of biofilms, their role during bacteremia is
   unknown. We examined the impact of physiological fluid shear forces on
   the development of multicellular aggregates of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
   Methods. Wild-type and O-antigen or capsular mutants of K. pneumoniae
   were grown as broth culture in a Taylor-Couette flow cell configured to
   provide continuous shear forces comparable to those encountered in the
   human arterial circulation (ie, on the order of 1.0 Pa). The size
   distribution and antibiotic resistance of aggregates formed in this
   apparatus were determined, as was their ability to persist in the
   bloodstream of mice following intravenous injection.
   Results. Unlike growth in shaking flasks, bacteria grown in the test
   apparatus readily formed aggregates, a phenotype largely absent in
   capsular mutants and to a lesser degree in O-antigen mutants. Aggregates
   were found to persist in the bloodstream of mice. Importantly, organisms
   grown under physiological shear were found to have an antibiotic
   resistance phenotype intermediate between that of fully planktonic and
   biofilm states.
   Conclusions. When grown under intravascular-magnitude fluid dynamic
   conditions, K. pneumoniae spontaneously develops into multicellular
   aggregates that are capable of persisting in the circulation and exhibit
   increased antibiotic resistance.}},

Abstract = {{DNA short oligo, surfactant, peptides, and polymer-assisted dispersion
   of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs) in aqueous solution have been
   intensively studied. It has been suggested that van der Waals
   interaction, pi-pi stacking, and hydrophobic interaction are major
   factors that account for the SWCNTs dispersion. Fluorophore and dye
   molecules such as Rhodamine B and fluorescein have both hydrophilic and
   hydrophobic moieties. These molecules also contain pi-conjugated systems
   that can potentially interact with SWCNTs to induce its dispersion.
   Through a systematic study, here we show that SWCNTs can be dispersed in
   aqueous solution in the presence of various fluorophore or dye
   molecules. However, the ability of a fluorophore or dye molecule to
   disperse SWCNTs is not correlated with the stability of the
   fluorophore/dye-SWCNT complex, suggesting that the on-rate of
   fluorophore/dye binding to SWCNTs may dominate the efficiency of this
   process. We also examined the uptake of fluorophore molecules by
   mammalian cells when these molecules formed complexes with SWCNTs. The
   results can have potential applications in the delivery of poor
   cell-penetrating fluorophore molecules.}},

Abstract = {{We perform a comprehensive first-principles statistical mechanical study
   of the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of lithiated anatase
   LixTiO2. We establish that the experimentally observed step in the
   voltage vs lithium composition curve between x = 0.5 and 0.6 is due to
   Li ordering. Furthermore, we predict that full lithiation of anatase
   TiO2 is thermodynamically possible at positive voltages but that there
   is an enormous difference in Li diffusion coefficients in the dilute and
   fully lithiated forms of TiO2, providing an explanation for the limited
   capacity in large electrode particles. We also predict that Li diffusion
   in the ordered phase (Li0.5TiO2) is strictly one-dimensional. The TiO2
   to Li0.5TiO2 phase transition has much in common with shape memory
   alloys. Crystallographically, it can support strain invariant interfaces
   separating TiO2 and Li0.5TiO2 within the same particle. The strain
   invariant interfaces are parallel to the one-dimensional diffusion
   direction in Li0.5TiO2, which, we argue, has important consequences for
   the role of particle shape on achievable capacity, charge and discharge
   rates, and hysteresis.}},

Abstract = {{In pixelated CdZnTe detectors, multiple interaction gamma-ray events are
   critical because they permit Compton imaging. However, in large-volume
   CdZnTe crystals, the depth of multiple interaction events is often
   poorly reconstructed due to significant nonuniformity of electron drift
   velocity while the depth of single interaction events can be accurately
   reconstructed using signal ratios. The nonuniformity of the drift
   velocity is likely due to nonuniformity in the electric field within the
   detector. This causes variation in the drift time even amongst events
   that occur at the same depth of interaction in the same pixel. The
   degradation in the depth reconstruction results in poorer imaging
   performance. The electron drift velocity at each depth is measured using
   Am-241 alpha particles incident on the entire cathode surface of each
   detector. Cathode waveforms are recorded for events collected by each
   element in the 11 x 11 array of anode pixels. To illustrate the impact
   of electron drift time variation, two CdZnTe crystals fabricated by
   Redlen Technologies with similar spectral performance, but significantly
   different Compton imaging performance are selected. The detector with
   poorer imaging performance demonstrated significant nonuniformity of the
   electron drift velocity. This work clearly shows that even CdZnTe
   crystals with 1\% FWHM energy resolution at 662 key can have a
   nonuniform electron drift velocity, on the sub-pixel scale, which
   seriously degrades the Compton imaging performance of pixelated
   detectors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Muscle activation patterns during walking from transtibial amputees
   recorded within the residual limb-prosthetic interface}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Powered lower limb prostheses could be more functional if
   they had access to feedforward control signals from the user's nervous
   system. Myoelectric signals are one potential control source. The
   purpose of this study was to determine if muscle activation signals
   could be recorded from residual lower limb muscles within the prosthetic
   socket-limb interface during walking.
   Methods: We recorded surface electromyography from three lower leg
   muscles (tibilias anterior, gastrocnemius medial head, gastrocnemius
   lateral head) and four upper leg muscles (vastus lateralis, rectus
   femoris, biceps femoris, and gluteus medius) of 12 unilateral
   transtibial amputee subjects and 12 non-amputee subjects during
   treadmill walking at 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 m/s. Muscle signals were
   recorded from the amputated leg of amputee subjects and the right leg of
   control subjects. For amputee subjects, lower leg muscle signals were
   recorded from within the limb-socket interface and from muscles above
   the knee. We quantified differences in the muscle activation profile
   between amputee and control groups during treadmill walking using
   cross-correlation analyses. We also assessed the step-to-step
   inter-subject variability of these profiles by calculating
   variance-to-signal ratios.
   Results: We found that amputee subjects demonstrated reliable muscle
   recruitment signals from residual lower leg muscles recorded within the
   prosthetic socket during walking, which were locked to particular phases
   of the gait cycle. However, muscle activation profile variability was
   higher for amputee subjects than for control subjects.
   Conclusion: Robotic lower limb prostheses could use myoelectric signals
   recorded from surface electrodes within the socket-limb interface to
   derive feedforward commands from the amputee's nervous system.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution direct numerical simulations are conducted to analyse
   turbulent states of the flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a
   duct of square cross-section with electrically insulating walls and
   imposed transverse magnetic field. The Reynolds number of the flow is
   10(5) and the Hartmann number varies from 0 to 400. It is found that
   there is a broad range of Hartmann numbers in which the flow is neither
   laminar nor fully turbulent, but has laminar core, Hartmann boundary
   layers and turbulent zones near the walls parallel to the magnetic
   field. Analysis of turbulent fluctuations shows that each zone consists
   of two layers: the boundary layer near the wall characterized by
   small-scale turbulence and the outer layer dominated by large-scale
   vortical structures strongly elongated in the direction of the magnetic
   field. We also find a peculiar scaling of the mean velocity, according
   to which the reciprocal von Karman coefficient grows nearly linearly
   with the distance to the wall.}},

Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Ion beam irradiation has previously been demonstrated as a method for
   creating nanowire-like semiconductor nanostructures, but no previous
   studies have reported on the electrical properties of those structures.
   In this work we describe the creation and in situ transmission electron
   microscopy electrical characterization of nanoscale InAs spike
   structures on both InAs and InP substrates fabricated using a focused
   ion beam erosion method. Those InAs `nanospikes' are found to possess
   internal structures with varying amounts of ion damaged and single
   crystalline material. Nanospike electrical behavior is analyzed with
   respect to model electronic structures and is similar to cases of
   barrier limited conduction in nanowires. The different electrical
   responses of each nanospike are found to be the result of variation in
   their structure, with the conductivity of InAs nanospikes formed on InAs
   substrates found to increase with the degree of nanospike core
   crystallinity. The conductivity of InAs nanospikes formed on InP
   substrates does not show a dependence on core crystallinity, and may be
   controlled by the other internal barriers to conduction inherent in that
   system.}},

   bacterial gene expression data}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Statistical analyses of whole genome expression data require
   functional information about genes in order to yield meaningful
   biological conclusions. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
   Genes and Genomes (KEGG) are common sources of functionally grouped gene
   sets. For bacteria, the SEED and MicrobesOnline provide alternative,
   complementary sources of gene sets. To date, no comprehensive evaluation
   of the data obtained from these resources has been performed.
   Results: We define a series of gene set consistency metrics directly
   related to the most common classes of statistical analyses for gene
   expression data, and then perform a comprehensive analysis of 3581
   Affymetrix (R) gene expression arrays across 17 diverse bacteria. We
   find that gene sets obtained from GO and KEGG demonstrate lower
   consistency than those obtained from the SEED and MicrobesOnline,
   regardless of gene set size.
   Conclusions: Despite the widespread use of GO and KEGG gene sets in
   bacterial gene expression data analysis, the SEED and MicrobesOnline
   provide more consistent sets for a wide variety of statistical analyses.
   Increased use of the SEED and MicrobesOnline gene sets in the analysis
   of bacterial gene expression data may improve statistical power and
   utility of expression data.}},

Abstract = {{Microscale gas chromatography (mu GC) is an emerging analytical
   technique for in situ analysis and on-site monitoring of volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs) in moderately complex mixtures. One of the
   critical subcomponents in a mu GC system is a microfabricated
   preconcentrator (mu-preconcentrator), which enables detection of
   compounds existing in indoor/ambient air at low (similar to sub ppb)
   concentrations by enhancing their signals. The prevailing notion is that
   elution peak broadening and tailing phenomena resulting from undesirable
   conditions of a microfabricated separation column (mu-column) are the
   primary sources of poor chromatographic resolution. However, previous
   experimental results indicate that the resolution degradation still
   remains observed for a mu-column integrated with other mu GC
   subcomponents even after setting optimal separation conditions. In this
   work, we obtain the evidence that the unoptimized mu-preconcentrator
   vapor release/injection performance significantly contributes to
   decrease the fidelity of mu GC analysis using our state-of-the-art
   passive preconcentrator microdevice. The vapor release/injection
   performance is highly affected by the kinetics of the thermal desorption
   of compounds trapped in the microdevice. Decreasing the heating rate by
   20\% from the optimal rate of 90 degrees Cs-1 causes a 340\% increase in
   peak tailing as well as 70\% peak broadening (30\% peak height
   reduction) to the microscale vapor injection process.}},

Abstract = {{A nanoporous anodized aluminum oxide template is used as an
   incident-angle selective backreflector to lift the transparency vs.
   light absorption tradeoff in semi-transparent photovoltaics. Light
   incident at angles greater-than 45 degrees from the template normal is
   backscattered at greater-than 35\% intensity to a semitransparent
   photovoltaic increasing absorption and photocurrent. Meanwhile, light
   incident orthogonal to the template is transmitted with minimum
   attenuation (>85\% at 600 nm), limited only by a single-pass absorption

   proposed here, efficient capture of direct sunlight is possible while
   maintaining transparency at viewing angles close to the substrate

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a tandem organic photovoltaic cell incorporating
   solution- and vacuum-deposited small molecules as the active layers. A
   blue and green-absorbing boron subphthalocyanine chloride:C-70 graded
   heterojunction (HJ) sub-cell is combined with a green and red-absorbing
   functionalized squaraine/C-70 bilayer HJ sub-cell, resulting in a tandem
   cell with a wavelength response from 350 nm to 800 nm. The efficiency of
   the cells depends on process conditions such as solvent annealing,
   resulting in nanocrystalline morphology that leads to improved charge
   and exciton transport compared with un-annealed cells. The incorporation
   of C-70 in both sub-cells leads to an increase of short-circuit current
   by at least 30\% compared to analogous cells using C-60. The optimized
   power conversion efficiency of the tandem cell is 6.6\% +/- 0.1\%, with
   an open-circuit voltage of 1.97 +/- 0.1 V under simulated 1 sun, AM 1.5G
   illumination. The tandem cell voltage is equal to the sum of the
   constituent sub-cells, indicating that the transparent, Ag
   nanoparticle/MoO3 compound charge recombination layer interposed between
   the cells is nearly lossless. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Biofeedback improves postural control recovery from multi-axis discrete
   perturbations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Multi-axis vibrotactile feedback has been shown to
   significantly reduce the root-mean-square (RMS) sway, elliptical fits to
   sway trajectory area, and the time spent outside of the no feedback zone
   in individuals with vestibular deficits during continuous
   multidirectional support surface perturbations. The purpose of this
   study was to examine the effect of multidirectional vibrotactile
   biofeedback on postural stability during discrete multidirectional
   support surface perturbations.
   Methods: The vibrotactile biofeedback device mapped tilt estimates onto
   the torso using a 3-row by 16-column tactor array. The number of columns
   displayed was varied to determine the effect of spatial resolution upon
   subject response. Torso kinematics and center of pressure data were
   measured in six subjects with vestibular deficits. Transient and steady
   state postural responses with and without feedback were characterized in
   response to eight perturbation directions. Four feedback conditions in
   addition to the tactors off (no feedback) configuration were evaluated.
   Postural response data captured by both a force plate and an inertial
   measurement unit worn on the torso were partitioned into three distinct
   phases: ballistic, recovery, and steady state.
   Results: The results suggest that feedback has minimal effects during
   the ballistic phase (body's outbound trajectory in response to the
   perturbation), and the greatest effects during the recovery (return
   toward baseline) and steady state (post-recovery) phases. Specifically,
   feedback significantly decreases the time required for the body tilt to
   return to baseline values and significantly increases the velocity of
   the body's return to baseline values. Furthermore, feedback
   significantly decreases root mean square roll and pitch sway and
   significantly increases the amount of time spent in the no feedback
   zone. All four feedback conditions produced comparable performance
   improvements. Incidences of delayed and uncontrolled responses were
   significantly reduced with feedback while erroneous (sham) feedback
   resulted in poorer performance when compared with the no feedback
   condition.
   Conclusions: The results show that among the displays evaluated in this
   study, no one tactor column configuration was optimal for standing tasks
   involving discrete surface perturbations. Feedback produced larger
   effects on body tilt versus center of pressure parameters. Furthermore,
   the subjects' performance worsened when erroneous feedback was provided,
   suggesting that vibrotactile stimulation applied to the torso is
   actively processed and acted upon rather than being responsible for
   simply triggering a stiffening response.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze triphenyl molecules coupled to gold electrodes through five
   different end groups to understand the effect of end groups on the
   thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions. Our investigation
   suggests that end-group-mediated charge transfer between the molecule
   and electrodes plays an important role in the resulting thermoelectric
   properties. We find that the direction of charge transfer, which is
   governed by the electronegativity of the end-group functionalized
   molecule, is strongly correlated to the degree of reorganization of
   frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO-LUMO). In particular, isocyanide,
   nitrite, and amine end-group molecular junctions, with charge (electron)
   transfer out of the molecule, exhibit a strong overall downward shift in
   the energies of frontier molecular orbitals, whereas thiol and hydroxyl
   end-group molecular junctions, with charge transfer into the molecule,
   exhibit a smaller overall downward shift. Finally, our study shows that
   the sign of the thermopower of molecular junctions is closely related to
   the HOMO-LUMO energies and electronegativity of isolated molecules.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{233}},
Pages = {{40-48}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach for the topology optimization of
   structures under design-dependent pressure loading. Compared with
   traditional optimization problems with a fixed load, in a
   design-dependent load problem, the location, direction, and magnitude of
   the load change with respect to the design at every iteration. Using the
   SIMP model, the current method proposes a material boundary
   identification scheme by iteratively connecting points of equal density,
   with the use of a predefined void region. This predefined void region
   allows the structure to be loaded by pressure from outside the domain,
   as well as by pressure that is completely enclosed within the domain.
   This is particularly useful when there are multiple pressure vessels
   that can be interacting, or when symmetry cannot be used to bisect the
   pressure vessel. Also, by using an iso-density line to define the
   boundary, no additional artificial parameters that might affect the
   final solution are needed. An analytical method for deriving the
   sensitivity of the loads is also presented; this is an alternative to
   the finite-difference method and it could reduce the number of function
   calls. Numerical examples are presented to show the advantages and
   robustness of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The lack of functional ankle musculature in lower limb amputees
   contributes to the reduced prosthetic ankle push-off, compensations at
   other joints and more energetically costly gait commonly observed in
   comparison to non-amputees. A variety of energy storing and return
   prosthetic feet have been developed to address these issues but have not
   been shown to sufficiently improve amputee biomechanics and energetic
   cost, perhaps because the timing and magnitude of energy return is not
   controlled. The goal of this study was to examine how a prototype
   microprocessor-controlled prosthetic foot designed to store some of the
   energy during loading and return it during push-off affects amputee
   gait. Unilateral transtibial amputees wore the Controlled Energy Storage
   and Return prosthetic foot (CESR), a conventional foot (CONV), and their
   previously prescribed foot (PRES) in random order. Three-dimensional
   gait analysis and net oxygen consumption were collected as participants
   walked at constant speed. The CESR foot demonstrated increased energy
   storage during early stance, increased prosthetic foot peak push-off
   power and work, increased prosthetic limb center of mass (COM) push-off
   work and decreased intact limb COM collision work compared to CONV and
   PRES. The biological contribution of the positive COM work for CESR was
   reduced compared to CONV and PRES. However, the net metabolic cost for
   CESR did not change compared to CONV and increased compared to PRES,
   which may partially reflect the greater weight, lack of individualized
   size and stiffness and relatively less familiarity for CESR and CONV.
   Controlled energy storage and return enhanced prosthetic push-off, but
   requires further design modifications to improve amputee walking
   economy. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   required to reconnect the graph after the nodes are deleted (which we
   attempt to maximize). We formulate each problem as a mixed-integer
   program, and then study valid inequalities for the first two
   connectivity objectives by examining intermediate dynamic programming
   solutions to k-hole subgraphs. We randomly generate a set of test

Abstract = {{Ag-based catalysts on different nanocrystalline perovskite supports
   (MgTiO3, CaTiO3, SrTiO3, and BaTiO3), and nanocrystalline TiO2 support
   prepared by a sol-gel method and on a commercial alpha-Al2O3 support
   were comparatively studied for catalytic activity of the ethylene
   epoxidation reaction. The dependence of ethylene oxide production
   performance on calcination temperature of the support, type of titanate
   nanocrystal supports, Ag loading, and reaction temperature was
   systematically investigated. The catalysts were analytically
   characterized by a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDS), temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Among studied catalysts, the 17.2 wt\%
   Ag/SrTiO3 catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity towards
   ethylene epoxidation reaction.
   The long-term stability of the dominant catalysts (which exhibited a
   high catalytic activity to produce ethylene oxide) was studied at 48 h
   of time on stream. As shown in the figure, the 17.2 wt\% Ag/SrTiO3
   catalyst with the support calcination temperature of 923 K is the most
   effective catalyst for the ethylene epoxidation reaction, giving not
   only the highest EO selectivity but also providing the highest long-term
   stability.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{544-554}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In order to improve IC engine energy utilization efficiency, an open
   steam power cycle used for IC engine exhaust gas energy recovery is
   proposed. The bottom cycle concept is designed on a four-cylinder
   naturally aspirated IC engine: with three cylinders taken as ignition
   cylinder, the last one is used for steam expansion cylinder; IC engine
   exhaust pipe is coupled with a Rankine steam cycle system which uses the
   high temperature exhaust gas to generate steam; then, the steam is
   injected into steam expansion cylinder and expands in the cylinder. In
   this way, the Otto cycle (or diesel cycle) of traditional IC engine and
   the steam expansion cycle (open Rankine cycle) are coupled on IC engine.
   On this basis, the energy recovery potential of this bottom cycle is
   studied by cycle processes calculation and parameters analysis. The
   research results show that the recovery efficiency of exhaust gas energy
   is mainly limited by exhaust gas temperature. The maximum bottom cycle
   power can reach 19.2 kW and IC engine thermal efficiency can be improved
   by 6.3\% at 6000 r/min. All those can prove this novel bottom cycle
   concept has larger potential for energy saving and emission reduction on
   IC engine. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{There is a critical need for new energy-efficient solutions to separate
   oil-water mixtures, especially those stabilized by surfactants.
   Traditional membrane-based separation technologies are energy-intensive
   and limited, either by fouling or by the inability of a single membrane
   to separate all types of oil-water mixtures. Here we report membranes
   with hygro-responsive surfaces, which are both superhydrophilic and
   superoleophobic, in air and under water. Our membranes can separate, for
   the first time, a range of different oil-water mixtures in a single-unit
   operation, with >99.9\% separation efficiency, by using the difference
   in capillary forces acting on the two phases. Our separation methodology
   is solely gravity-driven and consequently is expected to be highly
   energy-efficient. We anticipate that our separation methodology will
   have numerous applications, including the clean-up of oil spills,
   wastewater treatment, fuel purification and the separation of
   commercially relevant emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{In modern communication systems, modulation is a key function that
   embeds the baseband signal (information) into a carrier wave so that it
   can be successfully broadcasted through a medium such as air or cables.
   Here we report a flexible all-graphene modulator circuit with the
   capability of encoding a carrier signal with quaternary digital
   information. By exploiting the ambipolarity and the nonlinearity in a
   graphene transistor, we demonstrate two types of quaternary modulation
   schemes: quaternary amplitude-shift keying and quadrature phase-shift
   keying. Remarkably, both modulation schemes can be realized with just 1
   and 2 all-graphene transistors, respectively, representing a drastic
   reduction in circuit complexity when compared with conventional
   modulators. In addition, the circuit is not only flexible but also
   highly transparent (similar to 95\% transmittance) owing to its
   all-graphene design with every component (channel, interconnects, load
   resistor and source/drain/gate electrodes) fabricated from graphene
   films.}},

Title = {{High resolution resistive thermometry for micro/nanoscale measurements}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{High resolution thermometry plays an important role in several
   micro/nanoscale studies. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the
   resolution of resistance thermometry schemes that employ an electrical
   sensing current to monitor the temperature-dependent resistance.
   Specifically, we theoretically and experimentally analyze four different
   schemes where modulated or unmodulated temperatures in microdevices are
   measured using modulated or unmodulated sensing currents. Our analysis
   and experiments suggest that measurement of unmodulated temperatures
   using a modulated sensing current improves the resolution in comparison
   to a scenario where an unmodulated sensing current is used. However,
   depending on the exact measurement conditions, such improvements might
   be modest as the overall resolution may be limited by random low
   frequency environmental temperature fluctuations. More importantly, we
   find that high-resolution thermometry can be achieved in the measurement
   of modulated temperatures. Specifically, we show that by using
   appropriate instrumentation and a 10 k Omega platinum resistance
   thermometer it is possible to measure modulated temperatures (0.5-20 Hz)
   with a resolution of about 20-100 mu K. The advances described here will
   enable a dramatic improvement in the heat-current resolution of
   resistive thermometry based microdevices that are used for probing
   nanoscale phonon and photon transport. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Title = {{Hybrid algorithm for modeling of fluid-structure interaction in

Journal = {{ACTA MECHANICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1030-1041}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to present and to validate a new hybrid
   coupling (HC) algorithm for modeling of fluid-structure interaction
   (FSI) in incompressible, viscous flows. The HC algorithm is able to
   avoid numerical instability issues associated with artificial added mass
   effects, which are often encountered by standard loosely coupled (LC)
   and tightly coupled (TC) algorithms, when modeling the FSI response of
   flexible structures in incompressible flow. The artificial added mass
   effect is caused by the lag in exchange of interfacial displacements and
   forces between the fluid and solid solvers in partitioned algorithms.
   The artificial added mass effect is much more prominent for
   light/flexible structures moving in water, because the fluid forces are
   in the same order of magnitude as the solid forces, and because the
   speed at which numerical errors propagate in an incompressible fluid.
   The new HC algorithm avoids numerical instability issues associated with
   artificial added mass effects by embedding Theodorsen's analytical
   approximation of the hydroelastic forces in the solution process to
   obtain better initial estimates of the displacements. Details of the new
   HC algorithm are presented. Numerical validation studies are shown for
   the forced pitching response of a steel and a plastic hydrofoil. The
   results show that the HC algorithm is able to converge faster, and is
   able to avoid numerical instability issues, compared to standard LC and
   TC algorithms, when modeling the transient FSI response of a plastic
   hydrofoil. Although the HC algorithm is only demonstrated for a NACA0009
   hydrofoil subject to pure pitching motion, the method can be easily
   extended to model general 3-D FSI response and stability of complex,
   flexible structures in turbulent, incompressible, multiphase flows.}},

Abstract = {{In this work the effect of multi-pass friction stir processing (FSP)

   top and bottom plate surfaces produced a novel, layered structure with
   three distinct microstructural zones associated with stirred, transition
   and core regions. In the stirred zone, FSP, followed by pressing at 200
   degrees C, created a 0.8 mu m ultrafine grain size which accounts for
   similar to 55 vol.\% of the material. The transition region (similar to
   10 vol.\%,), showed extensively sheared coarse grains distributed in a
   matrix of finer grains. However, the core region (similar to 35 vol.\%)
   showed extensive twinning inside coarse grains in an overall bimodal
   microstructure reminiscent of extrusion. The processed Mg with a strong
   basal texture exhibited high yield strength (>300 MPa) and retention of
   adequate tensile ductility (>10\%). The enhancement in mechanical
   properties of processed Mg is found to be highly influenced by the
   layered microstructure: UFG grained stirred zone, finer precipitates and

Abstract = {{A new statistical theory is introduced that takes into account the
   coupling between grain size, shape and crystallographic texture during
   deformation of polycrystalline microstructures. A ``grain size
   orientation distribution function{''} (GSODF) is used to encode the
   probability density of finding a grain size D along a direction (given
   by unit vector n) in grains with orientation g. The GSODF is sampled
   from the input microstructure and is represented in a finite element
   mesh. During elastoplastic deformation, the evolution of grain size D
   (in direction theta) and the orientation g is tracked by directly
   updating the GSODF probabilities using a Lagrangian probability update
   scheme. The effect of grain shape (e.g. in high aspect ratio grains) is
   modeled by including the apparent grain size as seen by various
   different active slip systems in the grain within the constitutive law
   for the slip system resistance. The prediction of texture and strains
   achieved by the statistical approach is compared to Taylor aggregate and
   finite element deformation analysis of a planar polycrystalline
   microstructure. The role of grain shape and size in determining plastic
   response is investigated and a new adaptive GSODF model for modeling
   microstructures with multimodal grain shapes is proposed. (c) 2012 Acta

Abstract = {{Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by episodic head pain
   and visual cortical phenomena. The pathogenesis of migraine is unknown
   and remains to be determined. Bright light, flickering light and certain
   visual patterns can trigger a migraine attack, and visual cortical
   hyperexcitability has been hypothesized to be responsible. Interictally,
   the brain of migraineurs functions normally under general conditions but
   abnormally only under some specific conditions, such as the observation
   of stressful visual patterns, suggesting studying the brain function
   could provide insights in migraine pathophysiology. The functional MRI
   technique is unique in probing specific cortical area activation under
   various stimulation conditions and studying the abnormal cortical
   activation associated with functional disorders in migraine. In this
   perspective, we discuss how a novel functional MRI technique can be used
   to identify those migraineurs suffering visual cortical
   hyperexcitability, and its potential as a biomarker to evaluate and
   possibly predict effectiveness of migraine-preventive treatments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of distributed computation over a network
   of wireless sensors. While this problem applies to many emerging
   applications, to keep our discussion concrete, we will focus on sensor
   networks used for structural health monitoring. Within this context, the
   heaviest computation is to determine the singular value decomposition
   (SVD) to extract mode shapes (eigenvectors) of a structure. Compared to
   collecting raw vibration data and performing SVD at a central location,
   computing SVD within the network can result in significantly lower
   energy consumption and delay. Using recent results on decomposing SVD, a
   well-known centralized operation, we seek to determine a near-optimal
   communication structure that enables the distribution of this
   computation and the reassembly of the final results, with the objective
   of minimizing energy consumption subject to a computational delay
   constraint. We show that this reduces to a generalized clustering
   problem and establish that it is NP-hard. By relaxing the delay
   constraint, we derive a lower bound. We then propose an integer linear
   program (ILP) to solve the constrained problem exactly as well as an
   approximate algorithm with a proven approximation ratio. We further
   present a distributed version of the approximate algorithm. We present
   both simulation and experimentation results to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of these algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of Bessel beams using a leaky radial waveguide is
   presented. The radial waveguide consists of a capacitive sheet over a
   ground plane. It supports an azimuthally invariant leaky-wave mode whose
   normal electric-field component is a truncated, zeroth-order Bessel
   function. The annular spectrum and nondiffractive extent of the Bessel
   beam is clearly linked to the complex wavenumber of the leaky-wave mode.
   The fields inside the radial waveguide are derived using classical
   vector potential techniques. A vector approach is employed to avoid
   paraxial approximations of earlier works and the associated limitations
   on shaping the Bessel beam. Design rules are provided to synthesize a
   desired propagating Bessel beam. A simple coaxial feed is proposed for
   the radial waveguide and its input impedance is derived analytically.
   The analytical results are also validated numerically. The proposed
   structure and design procedure can be used for generating arbitrary
   zeroth-order propagating Bessel beams at microwave and millimeter-wave
   frequencies.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The detection and tracking of targets in highly cluttered environments
   poses a challenge due to the strong clutter backscatter present in the
   scene. A design concept based on a planar retro-reflective array to aide
   in the standoff detection and tracking of large metallic objects in a
   warehouse setting is presented. While traditional methods to achieve
   enhanced detection involve an increase in gain of the target, this
   retro-reflector design seeks to minimize the footprint of the tag by
   utilizing contrasting polarization properties of the target compared to
   the surrounding clutter. This allows enhanced detection from a reduced
   size by maximizing the ratio of target signal to that of the clutter. To
   accomplish this, a unique series-fed dual polarized antenna is designed
   and implemented with minimal cross-coupling among elements. The
   isolation allows for the integration of amplifiers with switchable gains
   into the design architecture to further reduce size, enhance detection
   and provide the array with unique polarization properties further
   contrasting those of the clutter. These retro-reflector tags are
   provided a unique identification by modulating their radar cross section
   in a prescribed manner. This compact array is implemented at 26 GHz and
   design details including measured performance for this cross-polarized
   retro-reflective tag are presented.}},

Abstract = {{A new concept for development of a high-gain and miniaturized radio
   repeater is presented in this paper. The proposed system utilizes a
   small array of low-profile miniaturized planar antennas with vertically
   polarized radiation pattern as well as a modified ring hybrid coupler as
   the array power distribution circuit and a low-power high-gain amplifier
   chain. In this configuration, a small receiving antenna is placed
   between a pair of transmit antenna array, which are fed 180 degrees out
   of phase. The transmit array creates a null-plane where the receive
   antenna is placed, and this way an isolation value between the transmit
   and receive antennas in excess of 50 dB is achieved, while the shortest
   distance between the transmit and receive antennas is less than 0.16
   lambda(0).The proposed repeater has a small form factor and occupies a
   small volume (0.22 lambda(2)(0) x 0.03 lambda(0)). A prototype of the
   miniaturized radio repeater is fabricated and measured to verify the
   system performance. A radar cross section of the repeater is measured
   for evaluating the overall system gain and its bandwidth. It is shown
   that an amplifier chain with a gain of 50 dB can be inserted between the
   transmit and receive antennas, which results in the measured repeater
   RCS of 21.3 dBsm.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that solvent vapor annealing of small molecular weight
   organic heterojunctions can be used to independently control the
   interface and bulk thin-film morphologies, thereby modifying charge
   transport and exciton dissociation in these structures. As an example,
   we anneal diphenyl-functionalized squaraine (DPSQ)/C-60 heterojunctions
   before or after the deposition of C. Solvent vapor annealing of DPSQ
   before C-60 deposition results in molecular order at the
   heterointerface. Organic photovoltaics based on this process have
   reduced open circuit voltages and power conversion efficiencies relative
   to as-cast devices. In contrast, annealing following C-60 deposition
   locks in interface disorder found in unannealed junctions while
   improving order in the thin-film bulk. This results in an increase in
   short circuit current by >30\% while maintaining the open circuit
   voltage of the as-cast heterojunction device. These results are analyzed
   in terms of recombination dynamics at excitonic heterojunctions and
   demonstrate that the optimal organic photovoltaic morphology is
   characterized by interfacial disorder to minimize polaron-pair
   recombination, while improved crystallinity in the bulk increases
   exciton and charge transport efficiency in the active region.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to examine the ability of high-frame-rate,
   high-resolution imaging to monitor tissue necrosis and gas-body
   activities formed during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
   application. Ex vivo porcine cardiac tissue specimens (n = 24) were
   treated with HIFU exposure (4.33 MHz, 77 to 130 Hz pulse repetition
   frequency (PRF), 25 to 50\% duty cycle, 0.2 to 1 s, 2600 W/cm(2)). RF
   data from B-mode ultrasound imaging were obtained before, during, and
   after HIFU exposure at a frame rate ranging from 77 to 130 Hz using an
   ultrasound imaging system with a center frequency of 55 MHz. The time
   history of changes in the integrated backscatter (IBS), calibrated
   spectral parameters, and echo-decorrelation parameters of the RF data
   were assessed for lesion identification by comparison against gross
   sections. Temporal maximum IBS with +12 dB threshold achieved the best
   identification with a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve area
   of 0.96. Frame-to-frame echo decorrelation identified and tracked
   transient gas-body activities. Macroscopic (millimeter-sized) cavities
   formed when the estimated initial expansion rate of gas bodies (rate of
   expansion in lateral-to-beam direction) crossed 0.8 mm/s. Together,
   these assessments provide a method for monitoring spatiotemporal
   evolution of lesion and gas-body activity and for predicting macroscopic
   cavity formation.}},

   implemented in a third-order coupled resonator configuration. The filter
   is fabricated on a Borosilicate glass substrate using a surface
   micromachining technology that offers high-Q tunable passive components.
   Continuous electrostatic tuning is achieved using three tunable
   capacitor banks, each consisting of one continuously tunable capacitor
   and three switched capacitors with pull-in voltage of less than 40 V.
   The center frequency of the filter is tuned from 1 GHz down to 600 MHz
   while maintaining a 3-dB bandwidth of 13\%-14\% and insertion loss of
   less than 4 dB. The maximum group delay is less than 10 ns across the
   entire tuning range. The temperature stability of the center frequency
   from -50 degrees C to 50 degrees C is better than 2\%. The measured
   tuning speed of the filter is better than 80 mu s, and the is better
   than 20 dBm, which are in good agreement with simulations. The filter
   occupies a small size of less than 1.5 cm x 1.1 cm. The implemented

Abstract = {{The feasibility of using sintered stainless steel fiber felt (SSSFF) as
   gas diffusion layer (GDL) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells
   (PEMFCs) is evaluated in this study. The SSSFF is coated with an
   amorphous carbon (a-C) film by closed field unbalanced magnetron sputter
   ion plating (CFUBMSIP) to enhance the corrosion resistance and reduce
   the contact resistance. The characteristics of treated SSSFF, including
   microscopic morphology, mechanical properties, electrical conductivity,
   electrochemical behavior and wettablity characterization, are
   systematically investigated and summarized according to the requirements
   of GDL in PEMFC. A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with a-C coated
   SSSFF-15 GDL is fabricated and assembled with a-C coated stainless steel
   bipolar plates in a single cell. The initial peak power density of the
   single cell is 877.8 mW cm(-2) at a current density of 2324.9 mA cm(-2).
   Lifetime test of the single cell over 200 h indicates that the a-C
   coating protects the SSSFF-15 GDL from corrosion and decreases the
   performance degradation from 30.6\% to 6.3\%. The results show that the
   SSSFF GDL, enjoying higher compressive modulus and ductility, is a
   promising solution to improve fluid permeability of GDL under
   compression and PEMFC durability. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Traditionally, rendezvous and proximity maneuvers have been performed
   using open-loop maneuver planning techniques and ad hoc error
   corrections. In this paper, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is
   applied to spacecraft rendezvous and proximity maneuvering problems in
   the orbital plane. We demonstrate that various constraints arising in
   these maneuvers can be effectively handled with the MPC approach. These
   include constraints on thrust magnitude, constraints on spacecraft
   positioning within Line-of-Sight cone while approaching the docking port
   on a target platform, and constraints on approach velocity to match the
   velocity of the docking port. The two cases of a nonrotating and a
   rotating (tumbling) platform are treated separately, and trajectories
   are evaluated in terms of maneuver time and fuel consumption. For the
   case when the platform is not rotating and the docking port position is
   fixed with respect to the chosen frame, an explicit offline solution of
   the MPC optimization problem is shown to be possible; this explicit
   solution has a form of a piecewise affine control law suitable for
   online implementation without an on-board optimizer. In the case of a
   fast rotating platform, it is, however, shown that the prediction of the
   platform rotation is necessary to successfully accomplish the maneuvers
   and to reduce fuel consumption. Finally, the proposed approach is
   applied to debris avoidance maneuvers with the debris in the spacecraft
   rendezvous path. The significance of this paper is in demonstrating that
   Model Predictive Control can be an effective feedback control approach
   to satisfy various maneuver requirements, reduce fuel consumption, and
   provide robustness to disturbances. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Journal = {{IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{24-29}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The operations of a smart grid heavily rely on the support of
   communication infrastructures for efficient electricity management and
   reliable power distribution. Due to the strong dependency, the
   robustness of a smart grid communication network against attack is of
   the utmost importance for the deployment of the smart grid. Notably, the
   large scale and autonomous features of a smart grid render its cyber
   security quite vulnerable to adversaries. In this article, we introduce
   several intelligent attacks and countermeasures in smart grid
   communication networks, which aim for maximal damage or benefits by
   taking advantage of the network structure as well as the protocol
   functionality. We adopt the percolation-based connectivity in statistic
   mechanics to quantitatively analyze the network robustness. If the
   attack and defense strategies are involved, the attack can be further
   smart and complicated. Consequently, a two-player zero-sum game is
   introduced between the adversary and the defender, and the outcome of
   the game equilibrium is used to evaluate the performance of defense
   mechanisms with different network configurations. This article therefore
   offers novel insights and comprehensive analysis on the cyber security
   of a smart grid.}},

   PCB substrates to demonstrate the approach. A multilayer PCB design
   allows for the use of subsurface metal layers to transmit the RF signal
   into and out of the sealed encapsulation. The electrostatically actuated
   microrelays with 8.4-mm(2) footprints have 78-V pull-in voltage and
   1.1-Omega ON-state resistance. Packaged microrelays exhibit down-state
   insertion loss and up-state isolation better than -0.25 and -15 dB,
   respectively, for frequencies up to 5 GHz. Packaged devices remain
   functional up to 20-W RF power under hot switching conditions. The high
   power lifetime of the microrelays is 10 913 cycles for 1-W incident RF
   power in 1-s pulses and 8414 cycles for 10-W incident RF power in 0.1-s
   pulses. The impact of device encapsulation and multilayer PCB substrate
   on device performance is addressed. {[}2011-0284]}},

Abstract = {{In prior research, specimen holders that employ a novel MEMS-based
   heating technology (Aduro (TM)) provided by Protochips Inc. (Raleigh,
   NC, USA) have been shown to permit sub-Angstrom imaging at elevated
   temperatures up to 1,000 degrees C during in situ heating experiments in
   modern aberration-corrected electron microscopes. The Aduro heating
   devices permit precise control of temperature and have the unique
   feature of providing both heating and cooling rates of 10(6 degrees)C/s.
   In the present work, we describe the recent development of a new
   specimen holder that incorporates the Aduro heating device into a
   ``closed-cell{''} configuration, designed to function within the narrow
   (2 mm) objective lens pole piece gap of an aberration-corrected JEOL
   2200FS STEM/TEM, and capable of exposing specimens to gases at pressures
   up to 1 atm. We show the early results of tests of this specimen holder
   demonstrating imaging at elevated temperatures and at pressures up to a
   full atmosphere, while retaining the atomic resolution performance of
   the microscope in high-angle annular dark-field and bright-field imaging
   modes.}},

   2012. Abstract Objective: Embolotherapy is a potential means to treat a
   variety of cancers. Our approachgas embolotherapyintroduces the droplets
   upstream from the tumor and then acoustically activates them to form
   bubbles for occlusiona process known as ADV. We wanted to provide the
   first optical documentation of ADV, lodged bubbles, or vessel occlusion
   in vivo. Methods: We used the rat cremaster muscle for in vivo
   microscopy. Perfluorocarbon droplets were administered into the aortic
   arch. Ultrasound exposures in the cremaster induced vaporization. The
   cremaster was examined pre- and post-exposure for ADV-related effects.
   Two sets of experiments compared the effect of exposure in the
   capillaries versus the first order arteriole. Results: Bubbles that
   lodge following capillary exposure are significantly larger (76 mu m
   mean length, 36 mu m mean diameter) than those following feeder vessel
   exposure (25 mu m mean length, 11 mu m mean diameter). Despite the
   differing sizes in bubbles, the ratio of bubble length to the hydraulic
   diameter of all lodged bubbles was 2.11 (+/- 0.65; n = 112), which
   agrees with theoretical predictions and experimental observations.
   Conclusions: Our results provide the first optical evidence of targeted
   vessel occlusion through ADV. These findings could lay the groundwork
   for the advancement of gas embolotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the online learning problem involving rested and
   restless bandits, in both a centralized and a decentralized setting. In
   a centralized setting, the system consists of a single player/user and a
   set of K finite-state discrete-time Markov chains (arms) with unknown
   state spaces (rewards) and statistics. The objective of the player is to
   decide in each step which M of the K arms to play over a sequence of
   trials so as to maximize its long-term reward. In a decentralized
   setting, multiple uncoordinated players each makes its own decision on
   which arm to play in a step, and if two or more players select the same
   arm simultaneously, a collision results and none of the players
   selecting that arm gets a reward. The objective of each player again is
   to maximize its long-term reward. We first show that logarithmic regret
   algorithms exist both for the centralized rested and restless bandit
   problems. For the decentralized setting, we propose an algorithm with
   logarithmic regret with respect to the optimal centralized arm
   allocation. Numerical results and extensive discussion are also provided
   to highlight insights obtained from this study.}},

Abstract = {{Permanent-magnet (PM) motors with both magnets and armature windings on
   the stator (stator PM motors) have attracted considerable attention due
   to their simple structure, robust configuration, high power density,
   easy heat dissipation, and suitability for high-speed operations.
   However, current PM motors in industrial, residential, and automotive
   applications are still dominated by interior permanent-magnet motors
   (IPM) because the claimed advantages of stator PM motors have not been
   fully investigated and validated. Hence, this paper will perform a
   comparative study between a stator-PM motor, namely, a flux switching PM
   motor (FSPM), and an IPM which has been used in the 2004 Prius hybrid
   electric vehicle (HEV). For a fair comparison, the two motors are
   designed at the same phase current, current density, and dimensions
   including the stator outer diameter and stack length. First, the
   Prius-IPM is investigated by means of finite-element method (FEM). The
   FEM results are then verified by experimental results to confirm the
   validity of the methods used in this study. Second, the FSPM design is
   optimized and investigated based on the same method used for the
   Prius-IPM. Third, the electromagnetic performance and the material mass
   of the two motors are compared. It is concluded that FSPM has more
   sinusoidal back-EMF hence is more suitable for BLAC control. It also
   offers the advantage of smaller torque ripple and better mechanical
   integrity for safer and smoother operations. But the FSPM has
   disadvantages such as low magnet utilization ratio and high cost. It may
   not be able to compete with IPM in automotive and other applications
   where cost constraints are tight.}},

Abstract = {{With the benefits of automation, sensitivity and precision,
   microfluidics has enabled complex and otherwise tedious experiments.
   Lately, lab-on-a-chip (LOC) has proven to be a useful tool for enhancing
   non-invasive assisted reproductive technology (ART). Non-invasive gamete
   and embryo assessment has largely been through periodic morpohological
   assessment using optical microscopy and early LOC ART was the same. As
   we realize that morphological assessment is a poor indication of gamete
   or embryo health, more advanced biophotonics has emerged in LOC ART to
   assay for metabolites or gamete separation via optoelectrical tweezers.
   Off-chip, even more advanced biophotonics with broad spectrum analysis
   of metabolites and secretomes has been developed that show even higher
   accuracy to predicting reproductive potential. The integration of broad
   spectrum metabolite analysis into LOC ART is an exciting future that
   merges automation and sensitivity with the already highly accurate and
   strong predictive power of biophotonics. ((c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2, 1}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{We generalize the directed percolation (DP) model by relaxing the strict
   directionality of DP such that propagation can occur in either direction
   but with anisotropic probabilities. We denote the probabilities as
   p(down arrow) = p p(d) and p(up arrow) = p(1 - p(d)), with p
   representing the average occupation probability and p(d) controlling the
   anisotropy. The Leath-Alexandrowicz method is used to grow a cluster
   from an active seed site. We call this model with two main growth
   directions biased directed percolation (BDP). Standard isotropic
   percolation (IP) and DP are the two limiting cases of the BDP model,
   corresponding to p(d) = 1/2 and p(d) = 0,1 respectively. In this work,
   besides IP and DP, we also consider the 1/2 < p(d) < 1 region. Extensive
   Monte Carlo simulations are carried out on the square and the
   simple-cubic lattices, and the numerical data are analyzed by
   finite-size scaling. We locate the percolation thresholds of the BDP
   model for p(d) = 0.6 and 0.8, and determine various critical exponents.
   These exponents are found to be consistent with those for standard DP.
   We also determine the renormalization exponent associated with the
   asymmetric perturbation due to p(d) - 1/2 not equal 0 near IP, and
   confirm that such an asymmetric scaling field is relevant at IP.}},

Abstract = {{Regularized iterative reconstruction algorithms for imaging inverse
   problems require selection of appropriate regularization parameter
   values. We focus on the challenging problem of tuning regularization
   parameters for nonlinear algorithms for the case of additive (possibly
   complex) Gaussian noise. Generalized cross-validation (GCV) and
   (weighted) mean-squared error (MSE) approaches {[}based on Stein's
   unbiased risk estimate (SURE)] need the Jacobian matrix of the nonlinear
   reconstruction operator (representative of the iterative algorithm) with
   respect to the data. We derive the desired Jacobian matrix for two types
   of nonlinear iterative algorithms: a fast variant of the standard
   iterative reweighted least-squares method and the contemporary
   split-Bregman algorithm, both of which can accommodate a wide variety of
   analysis-and synthesis-type regularizers. The proposed approach
   iteratively computes two weighted SURE-type measures: predicted-SURE and
   projected-SURE (which require knowledge of noise variance sigma(2)), and
   GCV (which does not need sigma(2)) for these algorithms. We apply the
   methods to image restoration and to magnetic resonance image (MRI)
   reconstruction using total variation and an analysis-type
   l(1)-regularization. We demonstrate through simulations and experiments
   with real data that minimizing predicted-SURE and projected-SURE
   consistently lead to near-MSE-optimal reconstructions. We also observe
   that minimizing GCV yields reconstruction results that are
   near-MSE-optimal for image restoration and slightly suboptimal for MRI.
   Theoretical derivations in this paper related to Jacobian matrix
   evaluations can be extended, in principle, to other types of
   regularizers and reconstruction algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The definition of wireless mesh networks (WMNs) has been used in the
   literature to connote and epitomize the ideal, ubiquitous, pervasive,
   and autonomic networking technology. An increasing interest has been
   emerging on the development of 802.11-based WMN testbeds to test the new
   ideas and approaches more realistically as opposed to relying solely on
   simulations. Although the developed testbeds have provided several
   insights to researchers for furthering the technology, there are still
   several issues that need to be addressed, particularly, with the
   approval of new standards, such as IEEE 802.11s, IEEE 802.11n, and IEEE
   802.16, and upcoming protocols, such as IEEE 802.11ac, 802.11ad,
   802.11ah, and 802.11af TV White Space efforts. In this paper, our goal
   is to provide a taxonomy and insightful guidelines for the creation of
   802.11-based WMN testbeds as well as to identify several features that
   future WMN testbeds should possess. Utilizing these features, we
   evaluate the existing WMN testbeds. Finally, in addition to the existing
   WMN testbed experiments conducted at several layers of the protocol
   stack, we provide a list of open future research issues that can benefit
   from experiments on WMN testbeds. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {{A two-dimensional analytical model and experimental validation of garter
   stitch knitted shape memory alloy actuator architecture}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Active knits are a unique architectural approach to meeting emerging
   smart structure needs for distributed high strain actuation with
   simultaneous force generation. This paper presents an analytical
   state-based model for predicting the actuation response of a shape
   memory alloy (SMA) garter knit textile. Garter knits generate
   significant contraction against moderate to large loads when heated, due
   to the continuous interlocked network of loops of SMA wire. For this
   knit architecture, the states of operation are defined on the basis of
   the thermal and mechanical loading of the textile, the resulting phase
   change of the SMA, and the load path followed to that state. Transitions
   between these operational states induce either stick or slip frictional
   forces depending upon the state and path, which affect the actuation
   response. A load-extension model of the textile is derived for each
   operational state using elastica theory and Euler-Bernoulli beam bending
   for the large deformations within a loop of wire based on the
   stress-strain behavior of the SMA material. This provides kinematic and
   kinetic relations which scale to form analytical transcendental
   expressions for the net actuation motion against an external load. This
   model was validated experimentally for an SMA garter knit textile over a
   range of applied forces with good correlation for both the
   load-extension behavior in each state as well as the net motion produced
   during the actuation cycle (250\% recoverable strain and over 50\%
   actuation). The two-dimensional analytical model of the garter stitch
   active knit provides the ability to predict the kinetic actuation
   performance, providing the basis for the design and synthesis of large
   stroke, large force distributed actuators that employ this novel
   architecture.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an extension of linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control
   theory is used to determine the optimal state feedback controller for a
   vibratory energy harvesting system with Coulomb friction. Specifically,
   the energy harvester is a base-excited single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF)
   resonant oscillator with an electromagnetic transducer attached between
   the base and the moving mass. The development of the optimal controller
   for this system is based on statistical linearization, whereby the
   Coulomb friction force is replaced by an equivalent linear viscous
   damping term, which is calculated from the stationary covariance of the
   closed-loop system. It is shown that the covariance matrix and optimal
   feedback gain matrix can be computed by implementing an iterative
   algorithm involving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, this
   theory is augmented to account for a non-quadratic dissipation in the
   electronics used to control the energy conversion. Simulation results
   are presented for the SDOF energy harvester in which the performance of
   the optimal state feedback control law is compared to the performance of
   the optimal static admittance over a range of disturbance bandwidths.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to compute optimal open-loop trajectories
   for systems subject to state and control inequality constraints in which
   the cost function is quadratic and the state dynamics are linear. For
   the case in which inequality constraints are decentralized with respect
   to the controls, optimal Lagrange multipliers enforcing the inequality
   constraints may be found at any time through Pontryagin's minimum
   principle. In so doing, the set of differential algebraic Euler-Lagrange
   equations is transformed into a nonlinear two-point boundary-value
   problem for states and costates whose solution meets the necessary
   conditions for optimality. The optimal performance of inequality
   constrained control systems is calculable, allowing for comparison to
   previous, sub-optimal solutions. The method is applied to the control of
   damping forces in a vibration isolation system subjected to constraints
   imposed by the physical implementation of a particular controllable
   damper. An outcome of this study is the best performance achievable
   given a particular objective, isolation system, and semi-active damper
   constraints.}},

   neoplastic disease. We also note, however, that mice treated with
   rapamycin starting at 9 months of age have significantly higher
   incidence of testicular degeneration and cataracts; harmful effects of
   this kind will guide further studies on timing, dosage, and

Abstract = {{The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has found increasing
   application for the comparison of measured and computed data as well as
   the identification of instantaneous and time varying flow structures,
   particularly cyclic variability in reciprocating internal combustion
   engines. The patterns observed in the basis functions or modes are
   sometimes interpreted as coherent structures, though justification of
   this is not obvious from the mathematical derivations. Similarly, there
   is no consensus about whether or not the ensemble mean should be
   subtracted prior to performing POD on a data set. Synthetic flow fields
   are used here to reveal POD properties otherwise ambiguous in real
   stochastic flow data. In particular, each POD mode includes elements of
   all flow structures from all input snapshots and in general, several
   modes are needed to reconstruct physical flow structures. POD analysis
   of two experimental in-cylinder engine data is done: one flow condition
   where every cycle resembles the ensemble-averaged flow pattern, and the
   other with large cyclic variability such that no cycles resemble the
   ensemble average. The energy and flow patterns of the POD modes, derived
   with and without first subtracting the mean, are compared to each other
   and to the Reynolds decomposed flow to reveal properties of the POD
   modes.}},

Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{530-536}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to create an analytical framework to study
   the problem of squeezed film damping in micromirrors considering the
   bending of the supporting torsion microbeams. Using mathematical and
   physical justifications, nonlinear Reynolds equation governing the
   behavior of the squeezed gas underneath the mirror is linearized. The
   resulting linearized equation is then non-dimensionalized and
   analytically solved for two cases of the infinitesimal and finite
   tilting angle of the mirror. The obtained pressure distribution from the
   solution of the Reynolds equation is then utilized for finding the
   squeezed film damping force and torque applied to the mirror. The
   results show that in the case of the infinitesimal tilting angle, the
   squeezed film damping can be modeled with a linear viscous damping in
   both torsional and lateral directions. It is also shown that when the
   mirror's rotation angle is small, with increasing the length of the
   mirror, the damping force and damping torque are increased. For the case
   of the finite tilting angle it was observed that the applied damping
   torque highly depends on the tilting angle of the mirror as well as the
   ratio of its vertical to angular velocity and as a result the effect of
   the vertical velocity of the mirror on the squeezed film damping force
   and torque applied to the mirror cannot be simply neglected. It is
   expected that the qualitative and quantitative knowledge resulting from
   this effort will ultimately allow the analysis, optimization, and
   synthesis of micromirrors for improved dynamic performance. (C) 2012

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{Type 2 diabetes is associated with complications in the central nervous
   system (CNS), including learning and memory, and an increased risk for
   neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanism underlying this association is
   not understood. The aim of this study was to gain greater insight into
   the possible mechanisms of diabetes-induced cognitive decline.
   We used microarray technology to identify and examine changes in gene
   expression in the hippocampus of a murine model of type 2 diabetes, the
   db/db mouse. Bioinformatics approaches were then used to investigate the
   biological significance of these genes. To validate the biological
   significance we evaluated mRNA and protein levels.
   At 8 and 24 weeks, 256 and 822 genes, respectively, were differentially
   expressed in the db/db mice. The most significantly enriched biological
   functions were related to mitochondria, heat shock proteins, or the
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the majority of which were downregulated.
   The ER-enriched cluster was one of the clusters that contained the
   highest number of differentially expressed genes. Several of the
   downregulated genes that were differentially expressed at 24 but not at
   8 weeks are directly involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR)
   pathway and include two heat shock proteins (encoded by Hspa5 and
   Hsp90b1), a transcriptional factor (x-box binding protein 1, encoded by
   Xbp1), and an apoptotic mediator (DNA-damage inducible transcript 3,
   encoded by Ddit3).
   The changes that we observed in the UPR pathway due to ER stress may
   play a role in the pathogenesis of CNS complications in diabetes. The
   results of this study are a foundation for the development of
   pharmacological targets to reduce ER stress in diabetic hippocampi.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the application of the molecular dynamics simulation
   approach to the high-resolution visualization of the plastic material
   flow at the tool/workpiece interface during orthogonal cutting. MD
   simulation techniques have been applied to nano-scale processes, but due
   to restrictions in the model size and computational time, they have not
   been utilized to investigate processes occurring at the micro-scale.
   Techniques employed to extend the MD simulation techniques to the
   micro-scale are discussed. Preferred ranges for model parameters that
   provide for sufficient resolution in order to adequately describe the
   characteristic features of the plastic material flow, yet achieve
   significant reduction in the model computational times, are identified.
   An investigation of the plastic material flow at the tool/workpiece
   interface as the uncut chip thickness increases from 10\% to 90\% of the
   edge radius of the tool was undertaken. A key observation is that there
   is a marked variation in the geometry of the observed characteristic
   features, most notable being the rotation and growth of the stable
   built-up edge as the uncut chip thickness increases. Furthermore, the
   transition between the plowing and cutting regimes is observed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents evidence for Cesium (Cs) oxide aggregation in
   secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) craters in organic samples used
   for optoelectronic devices, after exposure to air. The morphology of

   including surface roughness characterization by Atomic Force Microscopy
   (AFM), surface chemical mapping and quantification by SIMS, Auger
   Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photon Spectroscopy (XPS).
   Altogether, two different organic molecules used in optoelectronic
   devices, Tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato) aluminum (Alq(3)) and Copper
   Phthalocyanine (CuPc), different layer thicknesses and deposition
   methods were studied as a function of depth and as a function of
   duration to air exposure. The results show that, after exposure to air,
   Cs containing particles appear at the crater bottom under certain
   conditions. These results are useful to understand the behavior of
   implanted Cs in view of avoiding artifacts when Cs-implanted samples

Abstract = {{The geometric alignment of turbulent strain-rate structures with
   premixed flames greatly influences the results of the turbulence-flame
   interaction. Here, the statistics and dynamics of this alignment are
   experimentally investigated in turbulent premixed Bunsen flames using
   high-repetition-rate stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. In all
   cases, the statistics showed that the most extensive principal
   strain-rate associated with the turbulence preferentially aligned such
   that it was more perpendicular than parallel to the flame surface normal
   direction. The mean turbulence-flame alignment differed between the
   flames, with the stronger flames (higher laminar flame speed) exhibiting
   stronger preferential alignment. Furthermore, the preferential alignment
   was greatest on the reactant side of the mean flame brush. To understand
   these differences, individual structures of fluid-dynamic strain-rate
   were tracked through time in a Lagrangian manner (i.e., by following the
   fluid elements). It was found that the flame surface affected the
   orientation of the turbulence structures, with the majority of
   structures rotating as they approached the flame such that their most
   extensive principal strain-rate was perpendicular to the flame normal.
   The maximum change in turbulent structure orientation was found to
   decrease with the strength of the structure, increase with the strength
   of the flame, and exhibit similar trends when the structure strength and
   flame strength were represented by a Karlovitz number. The mean change
   in orientation decreased from the unburnt to burnt side of the flame
   brush and appears to be influenced by the overall flame shape. (C) 2011

   the standard design structure matrix (DSM) to simultaneously show data
   dependency and process flow on a single diagram. Modifications include
   adding special components to define iterative processes, defining
   different line styles to show data and process connections
   independently, and adding a numbering scheme to define the order in
   which the components are executed. This paper describes the rules for
   constructing XDSMs along with many examples, including diagrams of
   several MDO architectures. Finally, this paper discusses potential
   applications of the XDSM in other areas of MDO and the future
   development of the diagrams.}},

Abstract = {{The knowledge of channel statistics can be very helpful in making sound
   opportunistic spectrum access decisions. It is therefore desirable to be
   able to efficiently and accurately estimate channel statistics. In this
   paper, we study the problem of optimally placing sensing/sampling times
   over a time window so as to get the best estimate of the parameters of
   an on-off renewal channel. We are particularly interested in a sparse
   sensing regime with a small number of samples relative to the time
   window size. Using Fisher information as a measure, we analytically
   derive the best and worst sensing sequences under a sparsity condition.
   We also present a way to derive the best/worst sequences without this
   condition using a dynamic programming approach. In both cases the worst
   turns out to be the uniform sensing sequence, where sensing times are
   evenly spaced within the window. Interestingly the best sequence is also
   uniform but with a much smaller sensing interval that requires a priori
   knowledge of the channel parameters. With these results we argue that
   without a priori knowledge, a robust sensing strategy should be a
   randomized strategy. We then compare different random schemes using a
   family of distributions generated by the circular beta ensemble, and
   propose an adaptive sensing scheme to effectively track time-varying
   channel parameters. We further discuss the applicability of compressive
   sensing in the context of this problem.}},

Abstract = {{As articular cartilage is avascular, and mature chondrocytes do not
   proliferate, cartilage lesions have a limited capacity for regeneration
   after severe damage. The treatment of such damage has been challenging
   due to the limited availability of autologous healthy cartilage and
   lengthy and expensive cell isolation and expansion procedures. Hence,
   the use of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), a potent regulator of
   chondrogenic expression, has received considerable attention in
   cartilage and osteochondral tissue engineering. However, the exact role
   of BMP-2 in cartilage repair has been postulated to promote both
   cartilage formation and subsequent cartilage degradation through
   hypertrophy and endochondral ossification. Furthermore, it is likely
   that the manner in which BMP-2 is presented to chondrocytes will
   influence the physiologic pathway (repair vs. degeneration). This study
   investigates the relative influence of BMP-2 on cartilage matrix and
   potential subsequent bone matrix production using primary chondrocytes
   seeded on designed 3D polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with chemically
   conjugated BMP-2. The results show that chemically conjugated BMP-2 PCL
   scaffolds can promote significantly greater cartilage regeneration from
   seeded chondrocytes both in vitro and in vivo compared with untreated
   scaffolds. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the conjugated
   BMP-2 does not particularly accelerate endochondral ossification even in
   a readily permissible and highly vascular in vivo environment compared
   with untreated PCL scaffolds. This study not only reveals the potential
   use of the BMP-2 conjugation delivery method for enhanced cartilage
   tissue formation but also gives new insights for the effects of
   conjugated BMP-2 on cartilage regeneration and osteochondral
   ossification. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part

Abstract = {{This paper reports that large-scale, all-solution processed, polymer,
   light-emitting diodes can be fabricated by a new blade-slit coating
   method under ambient conditions. It is practical to use an ionic
   solution and a ZnO nanoparticle solution as electron injection and
   electron transport materials, respectively, through a blade-slit coating
   system, and reduce the deviation of the layer thickness to less than
   one-third compared to the result of a conventional blade-only coating
   system. The standard deviations of the layer thickness coated by the
   blade-slit process were only 0.68 nm in the hole injection layer
   (PEDOT:PSS), and 2.3 nm in the polymer light-emitting layer (Super
   Yellow). In the case of blade-only coating, the standard deviations were
   5.7 nm and 5.7 nm, respectively. The film non-uniformities of PEDOT:PSS
   and the Super Yellow layers fabricated by the blade-slit method were
   only 2.1\% and 2.2\%. In the case of blade-only coating, those were
   7.9\% and 9.1\%, respectively. The application area was 80 mm x 70 mm.
   Moreover, because the devices do not contain any alkali or alkaline
   earth metals in the electron injection layer, they can be fabricated by
   an all-solution process in a normal air conditioned environment. The
   maximum luminous efficiency of all-solution blade-slit coated devices
   was as high as 5.26 cd/A without alkali metals, and the maximum
   luminance reached was 14120 cd/m(2) at 7.8 V. These results are
   comparable to the performance of spin-coated devices. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A series of templated carbons with various high surface areas (2033-3798

   these templated carbons were investigated and compared with
   superactivated carbon AX-21 and other reported porous carbon sorbents at
   298 K and 100 atm. Two relationships between the surface areas of these
   carbons and their hydrogen capacities were obtained. The relationship
   between molecular hydrogen capacity and surface area showed a 0.23 wt.\%
   H-2/1000 m(2)/g of carbon sorbent at 298 K and 100 atm, indicating that
   merely increasing surface areas of the carbon sorbents cannot achieve a
   significant molecular hydrogen capacity at ambient temperature.
   Spiltover hydrogen storage was achieved by doping Pt nanoparticles (as
   dissociative hydrogen source) on these carbons (spiltover hydrogen
   receptor). Our first result on the relationship between the spiltover
   hydrogen capacity and surface area showed 0.4 wt.\% H-2/1000 m(2)/g of

Abstract = {{Novel thermoreversible polymerizable vehicle was prepared from terpenes,
   such as camphene, camphor and menthol and acrylate monomers. The vehicle
   exhibits liquidity above room temperature and rigidity at room
   temperature, where the terpenes are crystalline dendrites and the
   acrylate monomer fills up the interdendritic space. The rigid vehicle
   polymerizes on UV illumination and the terpenes sublimed subsequently
   from the polymerized samples leaving highly porous polymeric samples
   with dendritic-shaped interconnected porosity up to similar to 92 vol\%.
   Increasing the terpenes content, the thermoreversible component, results
   in coarser dendritic structures. Lower recrystallization temperatures
   produce finer dendritic network, whereas recrystallization close to
   terpenes melting point results in larger continuous macropores. The
   proposed advantages include fast manufacturing because of fast
   recrystallization, achieving large pore size up to 13 mu m and tailoring
   of the porosity through the portion of the sublimable vehicle and
   recrystallization temperature. The applicability of this novel technique
   in the biomedical field is demonstrated on a composition containing
   triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), a monomer widely used for
   biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Swarms of self-propelled particles exhibit complex behavior that can
   arise from simple models, with large changes in swarm behavior resulting
   from small changes in model parameters. We investigate the steady-state
   swarms formed by self-propelled Morse particles in three dimensions
   using molecular dynamics simulations optimized for graphics processing
   units. We find a variety of swarms of different overall shape assemble
   spontaneously and that for certain Morse potential parameters at most
   two competing structures are observed. We report a rich ``phase
   diagram{''} of athermal swarm structures observed across a broad range
   of interaction parameters. Unlike the structures formed in equilibrium
   self-assembly, we find that the probability of forming a self-propelled
   swarm can be biased by the choice of initial conditions. We investigate
   how thermal noise influences swarm formation and demonstrate ways it can
   be exploited to reconfigure one swarm into another. Our findings
   validate and extend previous observations of self-propelled Morse swarms
   and highlight open questions for predictive theories of nonequilibrium
   self-assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting structure from the attributes of a material's building blocks
   remains a challenge and central goal for materials science. Isolating
   the role of building block shape for self-assembly provides insight into
   the ordering of molecules and the crystallization of colloids,
   nanoparticles, proteins, and viruses. We investigated 145 convex
   polyhedra whose assembly arises solely from their anisotropic shape. Our
   results demonstrate a remarkably high propensity for thermodynamic
   self-assembly and structural diversity. We show that from simple
   measures of particle shape and local order in the fluid, the assembly of
   a given shape into a liquid crystal, plastic crystal, or crystal can be
   predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Janus particles with differentially degradable compartments were
   prepared by electrohydrodynamic (EHD) co-jetting and subsequent
   controlled crosslinking. These bicompartmental particles are composed of
   an interpenetrating polymer network of poly(ethylene oxide) and
   poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) in one hemisphere and a crosslinked
   copolymer of dextran and poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) segments in
   the second compartment. The compositional anisotropy caused differential
   hydrolytic susceptibility: Although both compartments were stable at pH
   3.0, selective degradation of the PEO-containing compartment pH 7.4 was
   observed wtihin 5 days. Janus particles with differentially degradable
   polymer compartments may be of interest for a range of oral drug
   delivery applications because of their propensity for decoupled release

Abstract = {{SiO2 nanotubes containing Ni nanoparticles were synthesized in a
   template nonionic surfactant water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsion, and were
   characterized by bright-field TEM. The highly defined cylindrical
   nanotube cavities had a uniform diameter of 12-13 nm; however cavity
   lengths were shown to be strongly dependent on aging time before silica
   precursor addition, hydrazine concentration, and synthesis temperature.
   Depending on synthesis conditions, Ni@SiO2 (i.e., core@shell) nanotubes
   attained lengths up to 2 mu m. A hypothesis is advanced that gas phases
   form and remain entrained in reverse-micelles, effecting both their
   elongation and also the exclusion of agglomerating silica species to
   outer micellar regions, thereby causing cavity formation. SiO2 shell
   thicknesses could be controlled in the range of 5.1 to 12.4 nm by simple
   variation of the amount of silica precursor used. Furthermore, H-2
   chemisorption measurements demonstrated 14-15\% Ni dispersions, and N-2
   physisorption analyses showed intraparticle pores on the order of 1 nm.
   These results confirm the accessibility of active metal sites via
   diffusion through the porous silica shells. Therefore the reported
   Ni@SiO2 materials make an interesting addition to the developing class
   of M-1@M2Ox yolk-shell catalytic materials.}},

Title = {{Multiphasic Sensory Alginate Particle Having Polydiacetylene Liposome

Abstract = {{A novel fabrication method of monophasic, biphasic, and triphasic
   alginate microparticles having sensory polydiacetylene (FDA) liposomes
   has been developed to achieve selective and more sensitive
   multitargeting detection in solution. In this alginate microparticle
   based detection system, the sensory PDA liposomes are concentrated in
   the particles rather than being diluted in a solution, which is the case
   of a conventional solution based detection system, providing superior
   sensitivity and stability. The biphasic nature of the alginate
   microparticles was realized by coinjecting two different PDA
   liposome/alginate mixture solutions into a CaCl2 solution using a simple
   combined needle injection system. The size and the constituent of the
   Janus particles and the extended triphasic particles could be
   independently manipulated by controlling a centrifugal force and
   formulating the composition of the PDA liposome solutions, respectively.
   The multitargeting capability of such mutiphasic alginate particles was
   demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy The presented particle-based
   detection system has a great potential to be combined with a
   microfluidic device for the development of advanced biosensors having a
   high throughput screening capability.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) have profound
   effects on cellular functions. Here, we applied novel photosensitive
   polydimethylsiloxane (photoPDMS) chemistry to create photosensitive,
   biocompatible photoPDMS as a rigidity-tunable material for study of
   mechanoresponsive cellular behaviors. By modulating the PDMS
   cross-linker to monomer ratio, UV light exposure time, and postexposure
   baking time, we achieved a broad range of bulk Young's modulus for
   photoPDMS from 0.027 to 2.48 MPa. Biocompatibility of photoPDMS was
   assayed, and no significant cytotoxic effect was detected as compared to
   conventional PDMS. We demonstrated that the bulk Young's modulus of
   photoPDMS could impact cell morphology, adhesion formation, cytoskeletal
   structure, and cell proliferation. We further fabricated photoPDMS
   micropost arrays for multiscale study of mechanoresponsive cellular
   behaviors. Our results suggested that adherent cells could sense and
   respond to changes of substrate rigidity at a subfocal adhesion
   resolution. Together, we demonstrated the potential of photoPDMS as a
   photosensitive and rigidity-tunable material for mechanobiology studies.}},

Abstract = {{An asymmetric H-shaped model polybutadiene (PBd) melt, H(SS13LL20)B58,
   with a backbone of molar mass 58 kg/mol and with two short arms of molar
   mass 13 kg/mol and two long arms with molar masses around 20 kg/mol, was
   designed and synthesized by anionic polymerization and purified by
   fractional precipitation. To obtain this novel structure, two short arms
   were synthesized and linked together using
   4-(dichloromethylsilyl)diphenylethylene (DCMSDPE). The backbone was then
   grown from this linkage point to produce an asymmetric star intermediate
   terminating in a reactive anion at the end of the backbone. The two long
   arms were similarly grown in a separate reaction vessel and then linked
   by DCMSDPE, and these linked long arms were then attached to the
   backbone of the asymmetric star. The multiple steps of this reaction
   scheme led to multiple possible byproducts. The most likely of these
   were identified and quantified by temperature gradient interaction
   chromatography (TGIC) performed on both purified and unpurified
   H(SS13LL20)1358 product and its asymmetric star-shaped synthetic
   precursor. We then performed linear rheological studies on purified and
   unpurified H(SS13LL20)B58, its star precursor, and blends of the
   purified H polymer with its star precursor and found that their
   rheological behaviors can be predicted reasonably accurately by the
   ``hierarchical model{''} {[}Wang et al. (2010)], if the impurities
   identified by TGIC are accounted for in the rheological modeling. These
   results show that TGIC characterization of product and intermediate
   reaction products, supplemented by rheological studies of controlled
   blends, are important steps in determining the accuracy of rheological
   models of polymers with complex branching architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline ZrN thin films with 5 nm grain size, prepared by ion
   beam assisted deposition, maintained their isometric structure upon
   intensive displacive and ionizing irradiations, indicating an extremely
   high stability similar to bulk ZrN. However, a unique structural
   contraction up to 1.42\% in lattice parameter occurred only in
   nano-sized ZrN upon displacive irradiations. A significant nitrogen loss
   occurred with reduced N:Zr atomic ratio to 0.88, probably due to the
   production of displaced nitrogen atoms and fast diffusion along grain
   boundaries in nanocrystalline ZrN matrix. The accumulation of nitrogen
   vacancies and related strain relaxation may be responsible for the
   structural contraction. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{This study reports the results of the catalytic deoxygenation of
   2,3-benzofuran in supercritical water over a 5 wt\% platinum on
   activated carbon catalyst. We examine the effect of batch-holding time,
   water loading, hydrogen loading, and catalyst loading on the reaction
   products. The major products were 2-ethylphenol, ethylbenzene,
   ethylcyclohexanone, ethylcyclohexanol, and ethylcyclohexane. Increasing
   the water loading or decreasing the hydrogen loading decreases the
   selectivity to aromatic deoxygenated products (e.g. ethylbenzene) and
   increases the selectivity to hydrogenated deoxygenated products (e.g.
   ethylcyclohexane). Combining the results from these benzofuran
   experiments with results obtained in separate experiments with the
   above-mentioned reaction products as the starting reagent allowed for
   the development of the hydrothermal deoxygenation reaction network. The
   reaction network provided a foundation for a quantitative kinetic model
   that correlated the experimental results. The model showed that the
   experimental results were consistent with benzofuran having an
   inhibitory effect on the deoxygenation of ethylphenol to ethylbenzene.

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{With ab initio molecular dynamics we observe thermal disorder and find
   band convergence with increased temperature and close relation between
   thermal disorder and thermoelectric (TE) properties of p-doped PbTe.
   Lack of short-range order causes local overlap of valence orbitals and
   increase in density-of-states near the Fermi level. Effective mass
   becomes temperature-dependent peaking in the converged-band regime. With
   classical molecular dynamics (MD) and the Green-Kubo autocorrelation
   decay we find reduction in lattice thermal conductivity (suppression of
   short-and long-range acoustic phonon transports). The described
   thermal-disorder roles lead to high TE figure-of-merit (ZT), and good
   agreement with the experimental results.}},

Pages = {{4569-4588}},

Abstract = {{We study the treatment plan optimization problem for volumetric
   modulated arc therapy (VMAT). We propose a new column-generation-based
   algorithm that takes into account bounds on the gantry speed and dose
   rate, as well as an upper bound on the rate of change of the gantry
   speed, in addition to MLC constraints. The algorithm iteratively adds
   one aperture at each control point along the treatment arc. In each
   iteration, a restricted problem optimizing intensities at previously
   selected apertures is solved, and its solution is used to formulate a
   pricing problem, which selects an aperture at another control point that
   is compatible with previously selected apertures and leads to the
   largest rate of improvement in the objective function value of the
   restricted problem. Once a complete set of apertures is obtained, their
   intensities are optimized and the gantry speeds and dose rates are
   adjusted to minimize treatment time while satisfying all machine
   restrictions. Comparisons of treatment plans obtained by our algorithm
   to idealized IMRT plans of 177 beams on five clinical prostate cancer
   cases demonstrate high quality with respect to clinical dose-volume
   criteria. For all cases, our algorithm yields treatment plans that can
   be delivered in around 2 min. Implementation on a graphic processing
   unit enables us to finish the optimization of a VMAT plan in 25-55 s.}},

   (electron densities were similar to 2 x 10(11) m(-3)). The corresponding
   E region electric field of similar to 80 mV/m was larger than the
   excitation threshold for the Farley-Buneman instability. An
   auto-correlation analysis resolved, for the first time, the distribution
   of auroral E region backscatter with 3 km resolution in altitude and
   sub-degree resolution in aspect angle. Moreover, the measured Doppler
   velocities of the UHF scatter shows the phase speed saturation of the
   meter-scale plasma waves. The measured Doppler velocity is in excellent
   agreement with the C-s cos theta formula for auroral E region
   irregularities. Citation: Bahcivan, H., J. W. Cutler, M. Bennett, B.

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of transient cadmium perturbations on
   the structure and function of the microbial community in an activated
   sludge system. The impact of cadmium perturbation on the bioreactor
   performance, bacterial activity, bacterial community structure, and
   bacteria-protozoa interactions was examined. The bacterial community
   exhibited a short-term inhibition following a pulse perturbation of
   cadmium. Process recovery was associated with an increase in bacterial
   abundance above the unperturbed control reactor, followed by high
   biomass activity after the washout of cadmium. This trend was seen for
   multiple experiments at both laboratory- and pilot scale The increase in
   biomass activity could not be explained by changes in bacterial
   community structure. Independent experiments showed that the increase in
   bacterial abundance, and by association biomass activity, was caused by
   the decrease in the protozoal grazing due to the higher inhibition of
   ciliated protozoa as compared to bacteria when exposed to cadmium. This
   paper highlights the importance of expanding the investigative
   boundaries of the microbial ecology of bioengineered systems to include
   protozoal grazing, especially under perturbation scenarios.}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The deposition of a Cu-13 cluster on a Si (001) surface was studied by
   molecular dynamics simulations. Embedded atom method, Stillinger-Weber,
   and Lennar-Jones potentials were used to describe the interaction
   between cluster atoms, substrate atoms, and the cluster-substrate
   interaction. Quantitative characteristic parameters, such as kinetic
   energy of the cluster and the substrate, the degree of epitaxy, and the
   mean height of mass center of the cluster, were calculated to study the
   effect of substrate size and substrate temperature on cluster
   deposition. The substrate temperature was found to affect the degree of
   epitaxy at different substrate sizes. When the size ratio of the
   substrate and cluster is relatively small or large, the epitaxial degree
   was higher at 800 K than at 300 K. If the size of the substrate matches
   that of the cluster, the substrate temperature appeared to have minimum
   effect. For a given temperature, the substrate size was found to have no
   obvious effect on the degree of epitaxy or the mean height of mass
   center of the cluster. This observation indicated that simulations using
   even a small system can still give reliable results and qualitative
   description of the deposition phenomena. We also found that the cluster
   atoms prefer to diffuse along the {[}110] direction on the Si (001)
   surface. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Sizing electrodes is an important step during Lithium-ion battery
   manufacturing processes since poor cut edge affects battery performance
   significantly and sometime leads to fire hazard. Mechanical cutting
   could result in a poor cut quality with defects. The cutting quality can
   be improved by using a laser, due to its high energy concentration, fast
   processing time, small heat-affected zone, and high precision. The
   cutting quality is highly influenced by operating parameters such as
   laser power and scanning speed. Thus, we studied a numerical simulation
   to provide a guideline for achieving clear edge quality. In order to
   simulate electrodes laser cutting for Lithium-Ion batteries,
   understanding the behavior of current collectors is crucial. This study
   focuses on current collectors, such as pure copper and aluminium.
   Numerical studies utilized a 3D self-consistent mathematical model for
   laser-material interaction. Observations of penetration time, depth, and
   threshold during laser cutting processes of current collectors are
   described. The model is validated experimentally by cutting current
   collectors and single side-coated electrodes with a single mode fiber
   laser. The copper laser cutting is laser intensity and interaction time
   dependent process. The aluminium laser cutting depends more on laser
   intensity than the interaction time. Numerical and experimental results
   show good agreement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of ionization wave splitting and merging of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric-pressure fast ionization waves (FIWs) generated by
   nanosecond, high voltage pulses are able to propagate long distances
   through small diameter dielectric tubes or channels, and so deliver UV
   fluxes, electric fields, charged and excited species to remote
   locations. In this paper, the dynamics of FIW splitting and merging in a
   branched dielectric channel are numerically investigated using a
   two-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model with radiation transport, and
   the results are compared with experiments. The channel consists of a
   straight inlet section branching 90 degrees into a circular loop which
   terminates to form a second straight outlet section aligned with the
   inlet section. The plasma is sustained in neon gas with a trace amount
   of xenon at atmospheric pressure. The FIW generated at the inlet
   approaches the first branch point with speeds of approximate to 10(8) cm
   s(-1), and produces a streamer at the inlet-loop junction. The induced
   streamer then splits into two FIW fronts, each propagating in opposite
   directions through half of the loop channel. The FIWs slow as they
   traverse the circular sections due to a shorting of the electric field
   by the other FIW. Approaching the loop-outlet junction, the two FIW
   fronts nearly come to a halt, induce another streamer which goes through
   further splitting and finally develops into a new FIW front. The new FIW
   increases in speed and plasma density propagating in the straight outlet
   channel. The electrical structure of the FIWs and the induced streamers
   during the splitting and merging processes are discussed with an
   emphasis on their mutual influence and their interaction with the
   channel wall. The FIW propagation pattern is in good agreement with
   experimental observations. Based on numerical and experimental
   investigations, a model for the splitting and merging FIWs in the
   branched loop channel is proposed.}},

Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate arrays of optical patch nanoantennas can
   convert light polarization through reflection. By breaking the azimuthal
   symmetry, elliptical plasmonic patch nanoantennas exhibit both even and
   odd cavity modes, which can be expressed by Mathieu functions. It is
   shown that by properly orienting the incident polarization, a linearly
   polarized light in resonance with one cavity mode can be converted into
   an elliptical or circular polarization after reflection. Since the major
   cavity modes can be excited at all incident angles, the polarization
   conversion by these elliptical patch nanoantennas can be realized with
   wide range of incident angles. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We report the dendrimer-mediated synthesis and shape evolution of
   gold-silver alloy nanoparticles (Au-Ag alloy NPs) with different metal
   compositions. In this study, amine-terminated generation 5
   poly(amidoamine) dendrimers were used as stabilizers to prepare Au-Ag
   alloy NPs with different gold atom/silver atom/dendrimer molar ratios
   without the assistance of additional reducing agents. Following a
   one-step acetylation reaction to transform the dendrimer terminal amines
   to acetyl groups, a series of Au-Ag alloy NPs with surface acetyl groups
   were formed. The alloy NPs before and after acetylation reaction were
   characterized using H-1 NMR. UV-vis spectrometry, transmission electron
   microscopy. inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy,
   and X-ray absorption coefficient measurements. We showed that the
   optical property, the size, and the morphology of the bimetallic NPs
   were greatly affected by the metal composition and their surface
   modification. At the constant total metal atom/dendrimer molar ratio,
   the alloy NPs experienced a shape evolution from spherical particles and
   polyhedrons to curved nanowires with the Au content. Acetylation of the
   dendrimer terminal amines seemed to thicken the nanowires. The formed
   Au-Ag alloy NPs were stable at different pH (pH 5-8) and temperature
   (4-50 degrees C) conditions. X-ray absorption coefficient measurements
   showed that the attenuation intensity of the alloy NPs was dependent on
   both the metal composition and surface functional groups. At a given
   metal composition, the X-ray attenuation intensity of the binary NPs was
   enhanced after acetylation. The formed metal alloy NPs with tunable size
   and shape prepared using the dendrimer stabilizers may be used in a
   range of applications in catalysis, sensing, and biomedical sciences.

Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{We discuss hairy black hole solutions with scalar hair of scaling
   dimension Delta and (small) electromagnetic coupling q(2), near
   extremality. Using trial functions, we show that hair forms below a
   critical temperature T-c in the region of parameter space (Delta, q(2))
   above a critical line q(c)(2)(Delta). For Delta > Delta(0), the critical
   coupling q(c)(2) is determined by the AdS(2) geometry of the horizon.
   For Delta < Delta(0), q(c)(2) is below the value suggested by the near
   horizon geometry at extremality. We provide an analytic estimate of
   Delta(0) (numerically, Delta(0) approximate to 0.64). We also compute
   analytically the true critical line for the entire range of the scaling
   dimension. In particular for q = 0, we obtain an instability down to the
   unitarity bound. We perform explicit analytic calculations of T-c, the
   condensate and the conductivity. We show that the energy gap in units of
   T-c diverges as we approach the critical line (T-c -> 0).}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of mercury sorbents within electrostatic precipitators
   (ESPs) is not well-understood, despite a decade or more of full-scale
   testing. Recent laboratory results suggest that powdered activated
   carbon exhibits somewhat different collection behavior than fly ash in
   an ESP and particulate filters located at the outlet of ESPs have shown
   evidence of powdered activated carbon penetration during full-scale
   tests of sorbent injection for mercury emissions control. The present
   analysis considers a range of assumed differential ESP collection
   efficiencies for powdered activated carbon as compared to fly ash.
   Estimated emission rates of submicrometer powdered activated carbon are
   compared to estimated emission rates of particulate carbon on
   submicrometer fly ash, each corresponding to its respective collection
   efficiency. To the extent that any emitted powdered activated carbon
   exhibits size and optical characteristics similar to black carbon, such
   emissions could effectively constitute an increase in black carbon
   emissions from coal-based stationary power generation. The results
   reveal that even for the low injection rates associated with chemically
   impregnated carbons, submicrometer particulate carbon emissions can
   easily double if the submicrometer fraction of the native fly ash has a
   low carbon content. Increasing sorbent injection rates, larger
   collection efficiency differentials as compared to fly ash, and
   decreasing sorbent particle size all lead to increases in the estimated
   submicrometer particulate carbon emissions.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the design and analysis of a Mach-Zehnder
   interferometer (MZI) structure consisting of doubly-corrugated spoofed
   surface plasmon polariton (DC-SSPP) waveguide. The dependence of phase
   change on the dielectric loading of the DC-SSPP structure causes the
   output from both arms to interfere and enhances features on the
   transmission spectrum of the MZI. The paper uses a mathematical model to
   predict the phase accumulation of THz signals travelling through each
   arm of the MZI with various sample loadings. HFSS simulation has been
   performed to verify the theoretical modeling and produce more
   sophisticated results. The paper demonstrates that compared with
   single-armed SSPP waveguide, the proposed MZI structure shows
   significant shift of the transmission maxima and minima with high
   quality factors for the transmission peaks when different materials are
   loaded. The paper also demonstrates that the proposed DC-SSPP MZI
   structure can be potentially used in tag-free bio-molecular sensing. The
   highly localized E-M field at frequencies close to SSPP resonance is
   shown to reduce the sample amount needed to produce interference
   patterns without affecting the selectivity of the sensing structure.}},

Abstract = {{A distributed supervisory controller is proposed to achieve battery
   component swapping modularity (CSM) for a plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicle (PHEV). The CSM permits the designer to distribute a part of the
   supervisory controller to the battery module such that the PHEV can use
   a range of batteries while providing corresponding optimal fuel economy.
   A novel feedback-based controller for the charge sustaining mode is
   proposed to facilitate distributed controller design for battery CSM.
   The method based on sensitivity analysis of the control signals with
   respect to the battery hardware parameter is introduced to define the
   controller distribution architecture. The distributed controller gains
   are obtained by solving a bilevel optimization problem using the
   collaborative optimization and the augmented Lagrangian decomposition
   methods. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
   distributed controller can achieve battery CSM without compromising fuel
   economy compared to the centralized control case. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{As the desired feature size of mold-assisted lithography decreases
   rapidly efficient demolding process becomes more challenging due to
   strong adhesion between polymeric resists and fine-featured molds. We
   synthesized new macromolecular additives and investigated the effects of
   surface energy and contraction of resist materials on demolding
   propensity by monitoring the adhesion force between the resist and the
   applied mold. The resist's surface energy was controlled, as inferred
   from water contact angle measurements, by chemically modifying its
   hydroxyl functionality. The resist's degree of volume shrinkage during
   the photocuring procedure was also controlled by mixing in a newly
   developed chemical that has a multiple radical chain transfer
   capability. The adhesion force was proportionally reduced as the surface
   energy of the resist materials decreased and as the volume shrinkage was
   reduced. When the volume shrinkage control was applied in conjunction
   with the low surface energy resist material (LS-30UV), We obtained an
   optimized condition requiring a minimum force for releasing the mold
   from the cured resist layer.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims at characterizing experimentally laminar to turbulent
   transition induced vibrations. Here, the transition is known to be
   triggered by a Laminar Separation Bubble that results from a laminar
   separation of the boundary-layer flow on a hydrofoil. In this study we
   consider two NACA66312 (Mod) laminar hydrofoils at low angles of
   incidence (mostly 2 degrees and 4 degrees) and Reynolds numbers ranging
   from Re=450 000 to 1 200 000, in order to get transitional regimes. The
   first hydrofoil, made of steel (E=2.1 x 10(11) Pa), is referred to as
   the rigid hydrofoil, although it is seen to vibrate under the action of
   the LSB. To better understand the possible interaction between the flow
   and the foil vibrations, vibration measurements are repeated using a
   flexible hydrofoil (E=3 x 10(9) Pa) of same geometry (under zero
   loading) and in close configurations. The experiments are carried out at
   the French Naval Academy Research Institute (IRENav, France). Wall
   pressure and flow velocity measurements enable a characterization of the
   laminar separation bubble and the identification of a vortex shedding at
   a given frequency. It is hence shown that the boundary-layer transition
   induces important foil vibrations, whose characteristics in terms of
   frequency and amplitude depend on the vortex shedding frequency, and can
   be coupled with natural frequencies of the hydrofoils. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Current developments in computer-aided design (CAD) and solid free-form
   fabrication (SFF) techniques enable fabrication of scaffolds with
   precisely designed architectures and mechanical properties. The present
   study demonstrates the effect of precisely designed three-dimensional
   scaffold architectures on in vivo degradation. Specifically, three types
   of porous poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffolds with variable pore sizes,
   strut sizes, porosities, and surface areas fabricated by indirect SFF.
   In addition, one experimental group of PLLA solid cylinders was
   fabricated. The scaffolds and cylinders were subcutaneously implanted
   into mice for 6, 12 and 21 weeks. The solid cylinders exhibited a faster
   percentage mass loss than all porous scaffolds. Among the porous
   scaffolds the group with the largest strut size lost percentage mass
   faster than the other two groups. Strong correlations between surface
   area and percentage mass loss were found at 12 (R-2 = 0.681) and 21 (R-2
   = 0.671) weeks. Scaffold porosity, however, was not significantly
   correlated with degradation rate. Changes in molecular weight and
   crystallinity also resulted in changes in the chemical structures due to
   degradation, and the solid cylinders had faster crystallization due to
   more advanced degradation than the porous scaffolds. Scaffold
   compressive moduli decreased with degradation, but the resulting modulus
   was still within the lower range of human trabecular bone even after 21
   weeks. The loss in compressive moduli, however, was a complex function
   of both degradation and the initial scaffold architecture. This study
   suggests that CAD and fabrication, within a given material, can
   significantly influence scaffold degradation profiles. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The experimental trend of a reduced deposit with an increasing flow rate
   has been observed in a series of wax studies. Despite the fact that many
   previous studies intuitively attribute the reason to the ``shear
   removal{''}, the role of heat and mass transfer was frequently
   overlooked as the true explanation. In the current study, the Michigan
   Wax Predictor (MWP) was applied to elucidate this trend by analyzing the
   growth rate of the wax deposit in a series of flowloop experiments from
   first principles. The model was able to predict the experimentally
   observed decrease in deposit thickness with an increasing oil flow rate
   without any adjustable parameters. It was found that three effects exist
   to affect wax deposition when the oil flow rate is changed, and each one
   can either increase or decrease the growth rate of the deposit. These
   effects focus on the heat- and mass-transfer phenomena at the
   oil-deposit interface. In addition, this study also revealed that the
   dynamics of the competition between all of these three effects can vary
   as time progresses and that the overall behavior of the wax deposit
   growth is eventually determined by the most dominant effect of the
   three. These results have provided important insight for the effects of
   the oil flow rate on wax deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Properties of alternative fuels, such as cetane number, aromatic
   content, bulk modulus, etc., can vary significantly; thus, a detailed
   investigation is conducted to assess the impacts on engine combustion,
   efficiency, and emissions during steady-state and transient engine
   conditions. Insights can be used to maximize the benefits of alternative
   fuels or to avoid potential problems that stem from differing ignition
   and combustion characteristics of particular fuels. In this work,
   biodiesel (20\%, 50\%, and 100\% biodiesel blends), jet fuel JP8, and
   synthetic jet fuel S8 are compared to diesel \#2 (ULSD). Comparisons are
   made on ignition, combustion, particulate matter, particulate size
   spectra, and NOX emission at steady state under harmonized operating
   conditions, that is, with equalized fuel energy input. All experiments
   are conducted using the same baseline calibration originally developed
   for diesel fuel. Ignition delay and combustion phasing trends suggest
   the need for possible adaptation of ECU calibration. The impact of
   alternative fuels on particulate emission depended strongly on fuel
   aromatic content and oxygenation. NOX emission was correlated to
   multiple physical and chemical fuel properties. While the significance
   of different properties on NOX emission varied with engine condition,
   the CA50 location was strongly correlated at all conditions. This paper
   also includes detailed insight into particulate spectra obtained for all
   six fuels. Transient engine operation over a driving schedule was
   characterized with the engine-in-the-loop setup. The use of alternative
   fuels caused more aggressive cyber-driver behavior as a reaction to
   their lower energy densities. Different fueling histories were recorded
   with the alternative fuels and led to marked changes in instantaneous
   emissions traces. In particular, spikes of particulate emission in the
   exhaust that typically occur at accelerator tip-in were reduced with
   biodiesel, while extended high load operation was observed in order to
   follow the demanded vehicle velocity trace and led to higher NO.
   Cumulative results over the complete FTP 75 driving schedule indicate
   that transient engine operation reduces the particulate matter benefits
   of the alternative fuels. JP8 and S8 show slight NO emission benefits
   with biodiesel showing slightly worse NO emission when compared to
   steady state. The more aggressive driver behavior led to worse fuel
   economy.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the effects of different process variables on the
   gasification of Nannochloropsis sp., a marine microalga, in water with a
   Ru/C catalyst at 410 degrees C. About 45\% gasification efficiency was
   achieved at 75 min with a catalyst loading (mass of Ru/C catalyst/mass
   of dry algal biomass) of 1 g/g, a water density of 0.096 g/cm(3), and a
   4.3 wt \% loading of algae. Longer reaction times, higher catalyst
   loadings and water densities, and lower algae loadings provided higher
   gas yields. The level of catalyst loading had the most significant
   effect on both the yields and composition of the gaseous products.
   Complete gasification of the microalga was achieved with a catalyst
   loading of 2 g/g. The Ru/C catalyst recovered from an experiment and
   then reused in a new experiment was less active than fresh Ru/C. This
   loss of activity is, in large part, due to deactivation by sulfur, which
   is present in the microalga at about 0.5 wt \%. A simple two-step
   catalytic gasification mechanism, along with a step for catalyst
   poisoning by sulfur, led to a rate equation that was consistent with the
   experimental results for gasification efficiency. The presence in algae
   of sulfur and perhaps other elements, such as Cl, that are not as
   prevalent in terrestrial biomass indicates that efficient and effective
   gasification of microalgae could present new challenges in engineering
   and catalyst design.}},

   Communication capacity is the total amount of information exchanged

   period. We outline the major constraints on communication capacity which
   influence transmission capabilities from the satellite, ground station,
   and network perspectives. Orbit models are combined with engineering
   analysis software to compare the capacity of existing and future ground
   station networks. Simulation results from recent clustered satellite
   launches and representative ground networks are presented and the
   capacity properties are discussed. By studying network communication
   capacity, we find opportunities to optimize communication schedules
   across federated networks to simultaneously and autonomously support

Abstract = {{Application launch performance is of great importance to system platform
   developers and vendors as it greatly affects the degree of users'
   satisfaction. The single most effective way to improve application
   launch performance is to replace a hard disk drive (HDD) with a solid
   state drive (SSD), which has recently become affordable and popular. A
   natural question is then whether or not to replace the traditional
   HDD-aware application launchers with a new SSD-aware optimizer. We
   address this question by analyzing the inefficiency of the HDD-aware
   application launchers on SSDs and then proposing a new SSD-aware
   application prefetching scheme, called the Fast Application STarter
   (FAST). The key idea of FAST is to overlap the computation (CPU) time
   with the SSD access (I/O) time during an application launch. FAST is
   composed of a set of user-level components and system debugging tools
   provided by Linux OS (operating system). Hence, FAST can be easily
   deployed in any recent Linux versions without kernel recompilation. We
   implement FAST on a desktop PC with an SSD running Linux 2.6.32 OS and
   evaluate it by launching a set of widely-used applications,
   demonstrating an average of 28\% reduction of application launch time as
   compared to PC without a prefetcher.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented for on-orbit, attitude-independent magnetometer
   calibration that includes the effect of time-varying bias due to
   electronics onboard a spacecraft. The calibration estimates magnetometer
   scale factors, nonorthogonality, and constant as well as time-varying
   bias. The unique contribution of this paper is estimation of
   time-varying magnetometer bias due to nearby electronics. It is
   accomplished by including spacecraft telemetry in the measurement model
   and estimating constant parameters that map time-varying current to
   magnetometer bias. The calibration is demonstrated by application to
   flight data from the RAX-1 satellite and significantly reduces the
   uncertainty of off-the-shelf magnetometers embedded within the satellite
   and subject to spacecraft-generated fields. This method simplifies the
   satellite design process by reducing the need for booms and strict
   magnetic cleanliness, resulting in reduced satellite development time
   and cost. In addition to on-orbit magnetometers, the calibration method
   is applicable to air, ground, and water navigation.}},

Abstract = {{The multibody flight dynamics of flapping-wing micro air vehicles are

   a method for approximating the first-order equations of motion for a

   derived from a coupled, multibody representation of the system. The
   first-order equations are analyzed using an approximation method called
   quarter-cycle averaging. The quarter-cycle averaging method is necessary
   because the classical averaging techniques are not available. The
   quarter-cycle approximation method is applied to representations of
   hovering flight and forward flight. The method enables the calculation
   of equilibrium points for the averaged system. For both flight regimes,
   the quarter-cycle approximatio method provides an order of magnitude
   improvement in accuracy when compared to local averaging.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess the importance of actuator
   hysteresis on vibration and noise reduction in a rotorcraft equipped
   with an actively controlled flap (ACF) system. A hysteresis model, based
   on a generalized form of the classical Preisach model, was developed
   using experimental data. The model displays good agreement with
   experimental data for inputs representative of those used for vibration
   and noise reduction in full-scale rotors. The hysteresis model has been
   incorporated into the AVINOR code to determine the effect of actuator
   hysteresis on vibration and noise reduction in both open and closed-loop
   modes of operation. It was found that the hysteresis level of a
   representative piezoceramic actuator does not produce a significant
   performance degradation of the ACF system for vibration reduction under
   blade-vortex interaction (BVI) and dynamic stall conditions. For
   open-loop BVI noise control, the presence of hysteresis produces a
   significant effect on the maximum noise reduction obtained using 2 per
   revolution (rev) and 5/rev harmonic inputs. For closed-loop BVI noise
   control, hysteresis introduces a substantial difference in flap
   deflection time histories; however, the overall noise reduction
   performance of the ACF system is not affected because the controller
   compensates for actuator hysteresis.}},

Abstract = {{Porous dielectric materials offer lower capacitances that reduce RC time
   delays in integrated circuits. Typical porous low dielectric (low-k)
   materials include SiOCH-silicon dioxide with carbon groups, principally
   -CH3, lining the pores. Fluorocarbon plasmas are often used to etch such
   low-k materials. These processes leave a fluorocarbon polymer on the
   SiOCH surface that must be removed, often with oxygen or hydrogen
   containing plasmas. Pores open to the surface and that are internally
   connected provide pathways for reactive species to enter into the porous
   network and produce damage. For example, during cleaning using O-2
   containing plasmas, reactions of O atoms with -CH3 groups can increase
   the k-value by removing C atoms. Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons
   produced by the plasma and that penetrate into the material can scission
   -Si-CH3 bonds and accelerate the removal of -CH3 groups. This paper
   reports on results from a computational investigation of Ar/O-2 and
   He/H-2 plasma cleaning of porous SiOCH when including the effects of VUV
   photons. The authors found that He/H-2 plasmas are able to clean CFx
   polymers deposited during etching while producing milder damage to
   underlying -CH3 sites compared to O-2 plasmas due to the lower
   reactivity of H atoms and the shorter penetration distance of photons
   produced in He/H-2 plasmas. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

Title = {{Damage by radicals and photons during plasma cleaning of porous low-k
   SiOCH. II. Water uptake and change in dielectric constant}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Porous dielectric materials provide lower capacitances that reduce RC
   time delays in integrated circuits. Typical low-k materials include
   porous SiOCH-silicon dioxide with carbon groups, principally CH3, lining
   the pores. With a high porosity, internally connected pores provide
   pathways for reactive species to enter into the material. Fluorocarbon
   plasmas are often used to etch SiOCH, a process that leaves a
   fluorocarbon polymer on the surface that must later be removed. During
   cleaning using Ar/O-2 or He/H-2 plasmas, reactions of radicals that
   diffuse into the SiOCH and photons that penetrate into the SiOCH can
   remove -CH3 groups. Due to its higher reactivity, cleaning with Ar/O2
   plasmas removes more -CH3 groups than He/H-2 plasmas, and so produce
   more free radical sites, such as -SiO2 center dot (a -SiO2-CH3 site with
   the -CH3 group removed). Upon exposure to humid air, these free radical
   sites can chemisorb H2O to form hydrophilic Si-OH which can further
   physisorb H2O through hydrogen bonding to form Si-OH(H2O). With the high
   dielectric constant of water, even a small percentage of water uptake
   can significantly increase the effective dielectric constant of SiOCH.
   In this paper, we report on results from a computational investigation
   of the cleaning of SiOCH using Ar/O-2 or He/H-2 plasmas and subsequent
   exposure to humid air. The authors found that plasma cleaning with
   He/H-2 mixtures produce less demethylation than cleaning with Ar/O-2
   plasmas, as so results in less water uptake, and a smaller increase in
   dielectric constant. The water that produces the increase in dielectric
   constant is roughly half chemisorbed and half physisorbed, the latter of
   which can be removed with mild heating. Sealing the pores with NH3
   plasma treatment reduces water uptake and helps prevent the increase in
   dielectric constant. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{Treatments of neurological diseases, diagnostics of brain malfunctions,
   and the realization of brain computer interfaces require ultrasmall
   electrodes that are ``invisible{''} to resident immune cells. Functional
   electrodes smaller than 50 mu m are impossible to produce with
   traditional materials due to high interfacial impedance at the
   characteristic frequency of neural activity and insufficient charge
   storage capacity. The problem can be resolved by using gold nanoparticle
   nanocomposites. Careful comparison indicates that layer-by-layer
   assembled films from Au NPs provide more than 3-fold improvement in
   interfacial impedance and 1 order of magnitude increase in charge
   storage capacity. Prototypes of microelectrodes could be made using
   traditional photolithography. Integration of unique nanocomposite
   materials with microfabrication techniques opens the door for practical
   realization of the ultrasmall implantable electrodes. Further
   improvement of electrical properties is expected when using special
   shapes of gold nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the formulation and evaluation of a centralized
   extended Kalman filter designed for a novel navigation system for
   underwater vehicles. The navigation system employs Doppler sonar, depth
   sensors, synchronous clocks, and acoustic modems to achieve simultaneous

   reference beacon eliminates the requirement for the underwater vehicle
   to remain in a bounded navigable area; the use of underwater modems and
   synchronous clocks enables range measurements based on one-way
   time-of-flight information from acoustic data-packet broadcasts. The
   acoustic data packets are broadcast from a single, moving reference
   beacon and can be received simultaneously by multiple vehicles within
   acoustic range. We report results from a simulated deep-water survey and
   real field data collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle survey

Abstract = {{This paper reports the effects of game technology on student learning in

   technology-based game either two times per week, or more than three
   times per week. A quasi-experimental control-group design with repeated
   measures analysis of variance and analysis of covariance was employed to
   explore performance differences between groups. The second study
   examined student learning in relation to characteristics such as their
   game performance, attitudes toward the game and toward mathematics, and
   gender and ethnicity. During a 4-month period, 50 second grade students
   from three classes played a technology-based game under conditions that
   varied depending on their teacher's direction. Multiple regression was
   used to determine the relationship between students' arithmetic scores
   and learner characteristics. Descriptive analyses by ability level,
   gender and ethnicity, and interview data about attitudes toward the

Abstract = {{Energetic materials (energetics), including explosives, propellants, and
   pyrotechnics, are an important class of materials for which performance
   depends critically on solid-state properties such as density and
   stability. Cocrystallization is emerging as a strategy to enhance
   materials properties of new and existing energetics; however, few
   examples exist where the principles to enable the successful engineering
   of such cocrystals have been delineated. To address this need, the
   cocrystallization of 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazacyclooctane
   (HMX), a powerful and widely used explosive, was investigated. Seven
   cocrystals of HMX were structurally elucidated using single crystal
   X-ray diffraction. These cocrystal structures, in addition to three
   previously reported structures, reveal at least three distinct
   structural motifs by which HMX cocrystals form, each dictated by the
   electronic character and size of the cocrystal former. From these
   structures, general trends emerge having direct implications for
   cocrystal properties including density, packing coefficient, sensitivity
   to impact, and thermal behavior. In addition, these impact-insensitive
   energetic cocrystals can be restored to sensitive delta-HMX upon gentle
   heating, demonstrating the potential for these cocrystals to function as

Abstract = {{We present a near-field plate that can generate an evanescent Bessel
   beam. The metallic plate consists of nonperiodic concentric corrugations
   that surround a coaxially fed aperture. The design procedure for such a
   device is outlined. The designed plate is simulated using a full-wave
   electromagnetic solver and is shown to produce an evanescent Bessel
   beam, thereby verifying its design and operation. The performance of the
   near-field plate is contrasted against a coaxial probe and a near-field
   plate designed to produce an Airy focal pattern with the same beamwidth.
   Such a device, capable of producing evanescent Bessel beams, will find
   applications in near-field probing/imaging systems, data storage, and
   biomedical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Mismatch motivates many of the design decisions for binary weighted,
   ratiometric converters, such as successive approximation (SAR)
   analog-to-digital converters (ADC), but the statistical relationship

   not been precisely quantified. In this paper, we analyze the effects of
   capacitor mismatch in a binary weighted, charge redistribution SAR ADC
   and derive a new analytic expression relating capacitor mismatch and the
   effective-number-of-bits (ENOB). We then explore the statistics of this
   new expression and develop a model that accurately predicts yield in
   terms of ENOB. Finally, the major results of this paper are generalized
   into a simple and compact design equation that relates resolution,
   mismatch, and ENOB to yield for all binary weighted, ratiometric
   converters. The expressions derived in this paper offer practical
   insight into the relationship between mismatch and performance for all
   binary, weighted ratiometric converters with these results validated

Abstract = {{Many motion-compensated image reconstruction (MCIR) methods have been
   proposed to correct for subject motion in medical imaging. MCIR methods
   incorporate motion models to improve image quality by reducing motion
   artifacts and noise. This paper analyzes the spatial resolution
   properties of MCIR methods and shows that nonrigid local motion can lead
   to nonuniform and anisotropic spatial resolution for conventional
   quadratic regularizers. This undesirable property is akin to the known
   effects of interactions between heteroscedastic log-likelihoods (e.g.,
   Poisson likelihood) and quadratic regularizers. This effect may lead to
   quantification errors in small or narrow structures (such as small
   lesions or rings) of reconstructed images. This paper proposes novel
   spatial regularization design methods for three different MCIR methods
   that account for known nonrigid motion. We develop MCIR regularization
   designs that provide approximately uniform and isotropic spatial
   resolution and that match a user-specified target spatial resolution.
   Two-dimensional PET simulations demonstrate the performance and benefits
   of the proposed spatial regularization design methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates application of the popular stepped-impedance
   technique to control the bandwidths of dual-band filters independently.
   Unlike previous dual-band stepped-impedance filters, the role of the
   stepped-impedance technique is to control the bandwidths of the two
   bands rather than to provide dual-band performance. The exact
   relationship between stepped-impedance ratios and the ratio of the two
   absolute bandwidths is obtained through rigorous analysis. Moreover,
   since the proposed filters can be synthesized with popular transmission
   lines and coupled lines that are very-well characterized, time-consuming
   full-wave simulation can be minimized. Along with the complete set of
   design equations, experimental results for transmission-line and
   coupled-line dual-band filters are provided that verify the proposed

Abstract = {{In the present work, errors generated in computations of compressible
   multi-material flows using shock-capturing schemes are examined,
   specifically pressure oscillations (when the specific heats ratio is
   variable), but also temperature spikes and species conservation errors.
   These numerical errors are generated at material discontinuities due to
   an inconsistent treatment of the convective terms. Though temperature
   errors are irrelevant to solutions to the Euler equations, it is shown
   that they have the potential to lead to problems when physical diffusion
   is included, i.e., for the Navier-Stokes equations. These errors are
   studied analytically and numerically by considering the one-dimensional
   advection of isolated material discontinuities. A methodology preventing
   such errors for weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes is
   presented, in which modified WENO weights are used to solve the
   transport equation for mass fraction in conservative form to prevent
   temperature and species conservation errors. Pressure errors are
   prevented by solving an additional transport equation for a given
   function of the ratio of specific heats. Several multi-dimensional
   problems with various discontinuities (shocks, material interfaces and
   contact discontinuities), including the single-mode Richtmyer-Meshkov
   instability, and turbulence are considered to test the method. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Ethics instruction is an important component of engineering
   undergraduate education, but little research has identified aspects of
   the undergraduate experience that contribute most to students' ethical
   development. Thus, an assessment of the impact of students' experiences
   on their ethical development is warranted.
   PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS)
   We apply a conceptual framework to the study of engineering students'
   ethical development. This framework suggests that both formal curricular
   experiences and co-curricular experiences are related to students'
   ethical development.
   DESIGN/METHOD
   Using survey data collected from nearly 4,000 engineering undergraduates
   at 18 institutions across the U.S., we present descriptive statistics
   related to students' formal curricular experiences and their
   co-curricular experiences. Additionally, we present data for three
   constructs of ethical development (knowledge of ethics, ethical
   reasoning, and ethical behavior).

   For our sample, the quantity and quality of students' formal curricular
   experiences and their co-curricular experiences related to ethics was
   high. The levels of ethical knowledge and reasoning varied, as did
   ethical behavior.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Our data highlight opportunities for improving the engineering
   undergraduate/bachelor's level curricula in order to have a greater
   impact on students' ethical development. We suggest that institutions
   integrate ethics instruction throughout the formal curriculum, support
   use of varied approaches that foster high-quality experiences, and
   leverage both influences of co-curricular experiences and students'
   desires to engage in positive ethical behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{The flexural response of a three-dimensional (3D) layer-to-layer
   orthogonal interlocked textile composite has been investigated under
   quasi-static three-point bending. Fiber tow kinking on the compressive
   side of the flexed specimens has been found to be a strength limiting
   mechanism for both warp and weft panels. The digital image correlation
   (DIC) technique has been utilized to map the deformation and identify
   the matrix microcracking on the tensile side prior to the peak load in
   the warp direction loaded panels. It has been shown that the geometrical
   characteristics of textile reinforcement play a key role in the
   mechanical response of this class of material. A 3D local-global finite
   element (FE) model that reflects the textile architectures has been
   proposed to successfully capture the surface strain localizations in the
   predamage region. To analyze the kink banding event, the fiber tow is
   modeled as an inelastic degrading homogenized orthotropic solid in a
   state of plane stress based on Schapery Theory (ST). The predicted peak
   stress is in agreement with the tow kinking stress obtained from the 3D
   FE model. {[}DOI:10.1115/1.4006501]}},

   Optimization Using a Coupling Measure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to the optimization of a dynamic
   systems design and control. Traditionally, these problems have been
   solved either sequentially or in a combined manner. We propose a novel
   approach that uses a previously derived coupling measure to quantify the
   impact of plant design variables on optimal control cost. This proposed
   approach has two key advantages. First, because the coupling term
   quantifies the gradient of the control optimization objective with
   respect to plant design variables, the approach ensures combined
   plant/control optimality. Second, because the coupling term equals the
   integral of optimal control co-states multiplied by static gradient
   terms that can be computed a priori, the proposed approach is
   computationally attractive. We illustrate this approach using an example
   cantilever beam structural design and vibration control problem. The
   results show significant computational cost improvements compared to
   traditional combined plant/control optimization. This reduction in
   computational cost becomes more pronounced as the number of plant design
   variables increases.}},

Title = {{Design and Proof-of-Concept Validation of a Latched Arch Active Seal}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Seals are integral to many industries such as aerospace, marine,
   oilfield, and automotive. A key performance metric for seal quality is
   quantified by the normal force between the seal and contact surface.
   Many applications have conflicting requirements on the normal force
   depending on the operational state. For example, in panel closures, to
   ease engagement of the seal the normal force (closing force) should be
   small; whereas, to maintain a high-quality seal the normal force
   (sealing force) should be large. While there is an abundance of seal
   technologies, there still exists a need for adaptable seals that can
   better accommodate the conflicting demands of multiple operational
   states and variations in application platforms. This paper introduces an
   active seal which controls normal force through modification of the
   structure of a rubber arch seal. While there are several options for
   actuation, this new technology is modeled, fabricated, and
   experimentally validated utilizing a shape memory alloy web actuation
   scheme. Finite element models provide a basis for a parametric study
   from which design guidelines are derived. The technology and supporting
   models/processes are demonstrated for an automotive panel closure
   successfully reducing the closing force by almost 50\%, while
   simultaneously increasing the sealing force by over 30\%.}},

Title = {{Two-Provider Technique for Bimanual Uterine Compression to Control
   Postpartum Hemorrhage}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Bimanual uterine compression may provide a reasonable
   treatment option for controlling or arresting postpartum hemorrhage in
   areas where access to care and advanced medical interventions are
   limited. Preliminary evidence suggests that correctly performed bimanual
   uterine compression is unsustainable for more than a few minutes,
   despite empirical evidence and practice recommendations that support
   extended compression for optimal effect. The objective of this study was
   to examine the impact of team-based (pairs) bimanual uterine compression
   for managing postpartum hemorrhage from uterine atony. Methods:
   Obstetricians, nurse-midwives, midwifery students, and unskilled birth
   attendants (N = 30) in Ghana performed bimanual uterine compression
   using a simulator with objective performance feedback (6 lights)
   corresponding to pressure sensors on the uterus. For each participant,
   we tracked the degree and duration of maintained uterine compression.
   Birth attendants were then paired (15 pairs) and were similarly assessed
   performing the technique as a team, with 1 attendant providing external
   compression to the uterine fundus using 2 hands and the other providing
   internal pressure against the body of the uterus with a single hand.
   Results: Individuals were unable to fully compress the uterus and
   maintain compression for more than 150 seconds without fatiguing. All
   paired teams were able to fully compress the uterus and maintain the
   compression for the maximum allotted time of 5 minutes. Discussion:
   Results suggest that bimanual uterine compression is more effective when
   performed by a team, with a primary attendant maintaining internal lower
   uterine segment pressure and monitoring the patient's condition and a
   partner applying external pressure to the uterine fundus. For cases
   where access to advanced medical care is limited or delayed,
   team-applied bimanual uterine compression could enhance the ability to
   control or arrest postpartum hemorrhage and increase the likelihood of
   maternal survival.}},

Abstract = {{Angiogenesis is fundamentally required for the initialization,
   development and metastatic spread of cancer. A rapidly expanding number
   of new experimental, chemical modulators of endothelial cell function
   have been described for the therapeutic inhibition of angiogenesis in
   cancer. Despite this expansion, there has been very limited parallel
   growth of in vitro angiogenesis models or experimental tools. Here we
   present the Responsive Angiogenic Implanted Network (RAIN)-Droplet model
   and novel angiogenesis assay using an endothelial cell culture model of
   microvascular endothelial cells encapsulated in a spontaneously
   self-assembling, toroidal hydrogel droplet uniquely yielding discrete,
   pre-formed, angiogenic networks that may be embedded in 3D matrices. On
   embedding, radial growth of capillary-like sprouts and cell invasion was
   observed. The sprouts formed not only as outgrowths from endothelial
   cells on the surface of the droplets, but also, uniquely, from the
   pre-formed network structures within the droplet. We demonstrate proof
   of principle for the utility of the model showing significant inhibition
   of sprout formation (P<0.001) in the presence of bevacizumab, an
   anti-angiogenic antibody. Using the RAIN-Droplet assay, we also
   demonstrate a novel dose-dependent pro-angiogenic function for the
   characteristically anti-angiogenic multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib.
   Exposure of endothelial cells in 3D culture to low, non-lethal doses (<1
   mu M) of sorafenib after initiation of sprouting resulted in the
   formation of significantly (P<0.05) more endothelial sprouts compared
   with controls over a 48-h period. Higher doses of sorafenib (5 mu M)
   resulted in a significant (P<0.05) reduction of sprouting over the same
   time period. The RAIN-Droplet model is a highly versatile and simply
   constructed 3D focal sprouting approach well suited for the study of
   vascular morphogenesis and for preclinical testing of drugs.
   Furthermore, the RAIN-Droplet model has facilitated the discovery of a
   novel pro-angiogenic capacity for sorafenib, which may impact the
   clinical application and dosing regimen of that drug. Laboratory

Abstract = {{One of the primary challenges associated with the neutronic analysis of
   a nuclear reactor is accounting for temperature feedback due to Doppler
   broadening. This challenge is addressed by a new ``on-the-fly{''}
   methodology that is applied during the random walk process in Monte
   Carlo codes with negligible impact on computational efficiency. The
   Monte Carlo code only needs to store 0 K cross sections for each isotope
   and the method will broaden the 0 K cross sections for any isotope in
   the library to any temperature in the range 77 to 3200 K for all
   incoming neutron energies up to 20 MeV. The methodology is based on a
   combination of Taylor series expansions and asymptotic series
   expansions. The type of series representation was determined by
   investigating the temperature dependence of U-238 resonance cross
   sections in three regions: near the resonance peaks, midresonance, and
   the resonance wings. The coefficients for these series expansions were
   determined by a regression over the energy and temperature range of
   interest. Since the resonance parameters are a function of the neutron
   energy and the target nuclide, the psi and chi functions in the
   Adler-Adler multilevel resonance model can be represented by series
   expansions in temperature only, allowing the least number of terms to
   approximate the temperature-dependent cross sections within a specified
   accuracy. The comparison of the broadened cross sections using this
   methodology with the NJOY cross sections was excellent over the entire
   temperature range (77 to 3200 K) and energy range. A Monte Carlo code
   was implemented to apply the combined regression model and used to
   estimate the additional computing cost, which was found to be <1\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider healthcare policy issues for trading off
   resources in testing, prevention, and cure of two-stage contagious
   diseases. An individual that has contracted the two-stage contagious
   disease will initially show no symptoms of the disease but is capable of
   spreading it. If the initial stages are not detected which could lead to
   complications eventually, then symptoms start appearing in the latter
   stage when it would be necessary to perform expensive treatment. Under a
   constrained budget situation, policymakers are faced with the decision
   of how to allocate budget for prevention (via vaccinations), subsidizing
   treatment, and examination to detect the presence of initial stages of
   the contagious disease. These decisions need to be performed in each
   period of a given time horizon. To aid this decision-making exercise, we
   formulate a stochastic dynamic optimal control problem with feedback
   which can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). However,
   solving the MDP is computationally intractable due to the large state
   space as the embedded stochastic network cannot be decomposed. Hence we
   propose an asymptotically optimal solution based on a fluid model of the
   dynamics in the stochastic network. We heuristically fine-tune the
   asymptotically optimal solution for the non-asymptotic case, and test it
   extensively for several numerical cases. In particular we investigate
   the effect of budget, length of planning horizon, type of disease,

Abstract = {{In intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), a treatment is designed to
   deliver high radiation doses to tumors, while avoiding the healthy
   tissue. Optimization-based treatment planning often produces sharp dose
   gradients between tumors and healthy tissue. Random shifts during
   treatment can cause significant differences between the dose in the
   ``optimized{''} plan and the actual dose delivered to a patient. An IMRT
   treatment plan is delivered as a series of small daily dosages, or
   fractions, over a period of time (typically 35 days). It has recently
   become technically possible to measure variations in patient setup and
   the delivered doses after each fraction. We develop an optimization
   framework, which exploits the dynamic nature of radiotherapy and
   information gathering by adapting the treatment plan in response to
   temporal variations measured during the treatment course of a individual
   patient. The resulting (suboptimal) control policies, which re-optimize
   before each fraction, include two approximate dynamic programming
   schemes: certainty equivalent control (CEC) and open-loop feedback
   control (OLFC). Computational experiments show that resulting
   individualized adaptive radiotherapy plans promise to provide a
   considerable improvement compared to non-adaptive treatment plans, while
   remaining computationally feasible to implement.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the Doppler spectra of the radar backscatter response of
   human body and a quadruped are presented at W-band frequencies. This
   study is motivated by the desire to utilize millimeter-wave radars to
   detect pedestrians against other targets in the radar scene. The
   approach is based on dissecting the radar backscatter to isolate the
   radar returns from different body parts. The forward model is based on
   an iterative physical optics approach. The complex motion of different
   parts of walking bodies and their amplitude and range of motion is
   directly reflected in their radar cross section (RCS) and Doppler
   spectrum bandwidth. It is shown that the Doppler spectra and RCS
   differences are sufficient to distinguish a walking human from
   stationary and other moving objects. Radar polarimetry in conjunction
   with time-frequency analysis is examined as a method for detecting
   concealed carried objects. The overall backscatter is decomposed into
   components associated with the limbs and torso which are then utilized
   to enhance target detection.}},

Title = {{Robust Leak Tests for Transmission Systems Using Nonlinear Mixed-Effect

Abstract = {{Problem: Leakage of the transmission fluid or oil in powertrain systems
   (i.e., transmissions, cylinder heads, engine blocks, etc.) can cause
   engine overheating and/or permanent damage. Therefore, it is crucial to
   run a leak test to inspect for any possible porosity in the casting
   parts. However, the inspection results for the amount of leakage at
   given testing times are sensitive to the tested part's temperature,
   which varies from part to part but was not previously incorporated in
   the leak testing systems. The objective of this paper is to develop a
   robust leak testing system that is insensitive to the part temperature
   variations in real production processes.
   Approach: In the production line, a part is tested at a temperature that
   is generally not equal to the calibration temperature at which the
   inspection threshold for leakage was set. To achieve a robust leak test
   that is insensitive to temperature variation in the tested part, we
   propose a temperature compensation algorithm to adjust the measured leak
   flow, taking into account the tested part temperature and the
   calibration temperature. For this purpose, a nonlinear mixed-effect
   model is first developed for modeling the leak flow profile as a
   function of both the leak testing time and the part temperature. Then,
   the fitted mixed-effect model is used to adjust the leak flow based on
   the calibration temperature. If the amount of the adjusted leakage at
   the given inspection time exceeds the inspection threshold, the part is
   rejected; otherwise, the part is accepted.
   Results: The proposed compensation algorithm is developed and validated
   using a set of training samples and another set of test samples,
   respectively. We use the percentage of error reduction in the leak flow
   measurements at different temperatures as the criterion to validate the
   developed compensation algorithm. The results show that the average
   percentage of error reduction for the test samples is about 92\%. This
   indicates a significant improvement in the leak testing results.}},

Abstract = {{Scaffold tissue engineering strategies for repairing and replacing soft
   tissue aim to improve reconstructive and corrective surgical techniques
   whose limitations include suboptimal mechanical properties, fibrous
   capsule formation and volume loss due to graft resorption. An effective
   tissue engineering strategy requires a scaffolding material with low
   elastic modulus that behaves similarly to soft tissue, which has been
   characterized as a nonlinear elastic material. The material must also
   have the ability to be manufactured into specifically designed
   architectures. Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) is a thermoset elastomer
   that meets these criteria. We hypothesize that the mechanical properties
   of PGS can be modulated through curing condition and architecture to
   produce materials with a range of stiffnesses. To evaluate this
   hypothesis, we manufactured PGS constructs cured under various
   conditions and having one of two architectures (solid or porous).
   Specimens were then tensile tested according to ASTM standards and the
   data were modeled using a nonlinear elastic Neo-Hookean model.
   Architecture and testing conditions, including elongation rate and wet
   versus dry conditions, affected the mechanical properties. Increasing
   curing time and temperature led to increased tangent modulus and
   decreased maximum strain for solid constructs. Porous constructs had
   lower nonlinear elastic properties, as did constructs of both
   architectures tested under simulated physiological conditions (wetted at
   37 degrees C). Both solid and porous PGS specimens could be modeled well
   with the Neo-Hookean model. Future studies include comparing PGS
   properties to other biological tissue types and designing and
   characterizing PGS scaffolds for regenerating these tissues. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Desmosomes and adherens junctions provide mechanical
   continuity between cardiac cells, whereas gap junctions allow for
   cell-cell electrical/metabolic coupling. These structures reside at the
   cardiac intercalated disc (ID). Also at the ID is the voltage-gated
   sodium channel (VGSC) complex. Functional interactions between
   desmosomes, gap junctions, and VGSC have been demonstrated. Separate
   studies show, under various conditions, reduced presence of gap
   junctions at the ID and redistribution of connexin43 (Cx43) to plaques
   oriented parallel to fiber direction (gap junction
   ``lateralization{''}).
   OBJECTIVE To determine the mechanisms of Cx43 lateralization, and the
   fate of desmosomal and sodium channel molecules in the setting of Cx43
   remodeling.
   METHODS Adult sheep were subjected to right ventricular pressure
   overload (pulmonary hypertension). Tissue was analyzed by quantitative
   confocal microscopy and by transmission electron microscopy. Ionic
   currents were measured using conventional patch clamp.
   RESULT Quantitative confocal microscopy demonstrated lateralization of
   immunoreactive junctional molecules. Desmosomes and gap junctions in
   lateral membranes were demonstrable by electron microscopy.
   Cx43/desmosomal remodeling was accompanied by lateralization of 2
   microtubule-associated proteins relevant for Cx43 trafficking: EB1 and
   kinesin protein Kif5b. In contrast, molecules of the VGSC failed to
   reorganize in plaques discernable by confocal microscopy. Patch-clamp
   studies demonstrated change in amplitude and kinetics of sodium current
   and a small reduction in electrical coupling between cells.
   CONCLUSIONS Cx43 lateralization is part of a complex remodeling that
   includes mechanical and gap junctions but may exclude components of the
   VGSC. We speculate that lateralization results from redirectionality of
   microtubule-mediated forward trafficking. Remodeling of junctional
   complexes may preserve electrical synchrony under conditions that
   disrupt ID integrity.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the electrical characteristics and electrical stress
   instabilities of amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (alpha-IGZO) dual-gate
   thin-film-transistors (DG TFTs). A threshold voltage of the bottom-gate
   (BG)-driven alpha-IGZO DG TFTs showed a linear dependence on the
   top-gate (TG) voltage. The slope of this dependence is associated with
   the ratio of the TG to BG insulator capacitance. The BG-driven DG TFT
   showed linear field-effect mobility comparable to that of a single-gate
   (SG) TFT without the TG electrode and a smaller saturation field-effect
   mobility and a larger subthreshold swing in comparison to the SG TFT.
   These characteristics were explained by the BG-driven DG TFT model
   formulated by taking the TG bias effect into account. The TG interface
   showed worse stability under an electric bias stress in comparison to
   the BG interface. It was also found that a negative voltage applied to
   the TG improved the stability of the DG TFT under a constant-current
   stress. These observations suggest that the BG-driven alpha-IGZO DG TFTs
   with the appropriate negative TG voltage applied can simultaneously show
   both normally off characteristics and higher stability than the SG TFTs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a class of k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) estimators
   called bipartite plug-in (BPI) estimators for estimating integrals of
   nonlinear functions of a probability density, such as Shannon entropy
   and Renyi entropy. The density is assumed to be smooth, have bounded
   support, and be uniformly bounded from below on this set. Unlike
   previous k-NN estimators of nonlinear density functionals, the proposed
   estimator uses data-splitting and boundary correction to achieve lower
   mean square error. Specifically, we assume that i.i.d. samples from the
   density are split into two pieces of cardinality and, respectively, with
   samples used for computing a k-NN density estimate and the remaining
   samples used for empirical estimation of the integral of the density
   functional. By studying the statistical properties of k-NN balls,
   explicit rates for the bias and variance of the BPI estimator are
   derived in terms of the sample size, the dimension of the samples, and
   the underlying probability distribution. Based on these results, it is
   possible to specify optimal choice of tuning parameters, for maximizing
   the rate of decrease of the mean square error. The resultant optimized
   BPI estimator converges faster and achieves lower mean squared error
   than previous k-NN entropy estimators. In addition, a central limit
   theorem is established for the BPI estimator that allows us to specify
   tight asymptotic confidence intervals.}},

Abstract = {{A computationally efficient fiber element approach has been developed to
   evaluate the thermostructural response of non-uniformly heated
   structural frames. The approach involves the use of two fiber-based
   elements for conducting the heat transfer and structural simulations. A
   numerical study is conducted here to evaluate the response of an
   unprotected beam exposed to a localized fire. Comparisons between the
   proposed fiber element approach and high-resolution finite element
   simulations demonstrate that the fiber-based thermal and structural
   elements collectively offer excellent accuracy. It is further shown that
   the fiber model substantially improves the computational efficiency by
   reducing the total number of degrees of freedom in the thermal and
   structural analyses. The proposed model further simplifies the transfer
   of thermal data from the heat transfer analysis to the structural model
   because the thermal and structural elements have the same mesh.

Abstract = {{Purpose: Assuming that early tumor volume change is a biomarker for
   response to therapy, accurate quantification of early volume changes
   could aid in adapting an individual patient's therapy and lead to
   shorter clinical trials. We investigated an image registration-based
   approach for tumor volume change quantification that may more reliably
   detect smaller changes that occur in shorter intervals than can be
   detected by existing algorithms.
   Methods and Materials: Variance and bias of the registration-based
   approach were evaluated using retrospective, in vivo,
   very-short-interval diffusion magnetic resonance imaging scans where
   true zero tumor volume change is unequivocally known and synthetic data,
   respectively. The interval scans were nonlinearly registered using two
   similarity measures: mutual information (MI) and normalized
   cross-correlation (NCC).
   Results: The 95\% confidence interval of the percentage volume change
   error was (-8.93\% to 10.49\%) for MI-based and (-7.69\%, 8.83\%) for
   NCC-based registrations. Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated that
   error in measuring volume change increased with increase in tumor volume
   and decreased with the increase in the tumor's normalized mutual
   information, even when NCC was the similarity measure being optimized
   during registration. The 95\% confidence interval of the relative volume
   change error for the synthetic examinations with known changes over +/-
   80\% of reference tumor volume was (-3.02\% to 3.86\%). Statistically
   significant bias was not demonstrated.
   Conclusion: A low-noise, low-bias tumor volume change measurement
   algorithm using nonlinear registration is described. Errors in change
   measurement were a function of tumor volume and the normalized mutual
   information content of the tumor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Non-equilibrium dissociation curves (NEDCs) have the potential to
   identify non-specific hybridizations on high throughput, diagnostic
   microarrays. We report a simple method for the identification of
   non-specific signals by using a new parameter that does not rely on
   comparison of perfect match and mismatch dissociations. The parameter is
   the ratio of specific dissociation temperature (Td-w) to theoretical
   melting temperature (T-m) and can be obtained by automated fitting of a
   four-parameter, sigmoid, empirical equation to the thousands of curves
   generated in a typical experiment. The curves fit perfect match NEDCs
   from an initial experiment with an R-2 of 0.998 +/- 0.006 and root mean
   square of 108 +/- 91 fluorescent units. Receiver operating
   characteristic curve analysis showed low temperature hybridization
   signals (20-48 degrees C) to be as effective as area under the curve as
   primary data filters. Evaluation of three datasets that target 16S rRNA
   and functional genes with varying degrees of target sequence similarity
   showed that filtering out hybridizations with Td-w/T-m<0.78 greatly
   reduced false positive results. In conclusion, Td-w/T-m successfully
   screened many non-specific hybridizations that could not be identified
   using single temperature signal intensities alone, while the empirical
   modeling allowed a simplified approach to the high throughput analysis
   of thousands of NEDCs. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop an approach for computer-aided detection (CAD) of
   small brain metastases in post-Gd T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI).
   Method: A set of unevenly spaced 3D spherical shell templates was
   optimized to localize brain metastatic lesions by cross-correlation
   analysis with MRI. Theoretical and simulation analyses of effects of
   lesion size and shape heterogeneity were performed to optimize the
   number and size of the templates and the cross-correlation thresholds.
   Also, effects of image factors of noise and intensity variation on the
   performance of the CAD system were investigated. A nodule enhancement
   strategy to improve sensitivity of the system and a set of criteria
   based upon the size, shape and brightness of lesions were used to reduce
   false positives. An optimal set of parameters from the FROC curves was
   selected from a training dataset, and then the system was evaluated on a
   testing dataset including 186 lesions from 2753 MRI slices. Reading
   results from two radiologists are also included.
   Results: Overall, a 93.5\% sensitivity with 0.024 of intra-cranial false
   positive rate (IC-FPR) was achieved in the testing dataset. Our
   investigation indicated that nodule enhancement was very effective in
   improving both sensitivity and specificity. The size and shape criteria
   reduced the IC-FPR from 0.075 to 0.021, and the brightness criterion
   decreases the extra-cranial FPR from 0.477 to 0.083 in the training
   dataset. Readings from the two radiologists had sensitivities of 60\%
   and 67\% in the training dataset and 70\% and 80\% in the testing
   dataset for the metastatic lesions <5 mm in diameter.
   Conclusion: Our proposed CAD system has high sensitivity and fairly low
   FPR for detection of the small brain metastatic lesions in MRI compared
   to the previous work and readings of neuroradiologists. The potential of
   this method for assisting clinical decision- making warrants further
   evaluation and improvements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI using the contrast agent
   gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) was performed on 10 patients with
   glioblastoma. Nested models with as many as three parameters were used
   to estimate plasma volume or plasma volume and forward vascular transfer
   constant (Ktrans) and the reverse vascular transfer constant (kep).
   These constituted models 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Model 1 predominated
   in normal nonleaky brain tissue, showing little or no leakage of
   contrast agent. Model 3 predominated in regions associated with
   aggressive portions of the tumor, and model 2 bordered model 3 regions,
   showing leakage at reduced rates. In the patient sample, vp was about
   four times that of white matter in the enhancing part of the tumor.
   Ktrans varied by a factor of 10 between the model 2 (1.9 ? 10-3 min-1)
   and model 3 regions (1.9 ? 10-2 min-1). The mean calculated interstitial
   space (model 3) was 5.5\%. In model 3 regions, excellent curve fits were
   obtained to summarize concentration-time data (mean R2 = 0.99). We
   conclude that the three parameters of the standard model are sufficient
   to fit dynamic contrast enhanced T1 data in glioblastoma under the
   conditions of the experiment. Magn Reson Med, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley

Volume = {{248}},
Pages = {{1-13}},

Abstract = {{A high temperature reactor (HTR) is a candidate to drive high
   temperature water-splitting using process heat. While both high
   temperature nuclear reactors and hydrogen generation plants have high
   individual degrees of development, study of the coupled plant is
   lacking. Particularly absent are considerations of the transient
   behavior of the coupled plant, as well as studies of the safety of the
   overall plant. The aim of this document is to contribute knowledge to
   the effort of nuclear hydrogen generation. In particular, this study
   regards identification of safety issues in the coupled plant and the
   transient modeling of some leading candidates for implementation in the
   Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative (NHI). The Sulfur Iodine (SI) and Hybrid
   Sulfur (HyS) cycles are considered as candidate hydrogen generation
   schemes.
   Three thermodynamically derived chemical reaction chamber models are
   coupled to a well-known reference design of a high temperature nuclear
   reactor. These chemical reaction chamber models have several dimensions
   of validation, including detailed steady state flowsheets, integrated
   loop test data, and bench scale chemical kinetics. The models and
   coupling scheme are presented here, as well as a transient test case
   initiated within the chemical plant. The 50\% feed flow failure within
   the chemical plant results in a slow loss-of-heat sink (LOHS) accident
   in the nuclear reactor. Due to the temperature feedback within the
   reactor core the nuclear reactor partially shuts down over 1500 s. Two
   distinct regions are identified within the coupled plant response: (1)
   immediate LOHS due to the loss of the sulfuric acid decomposition
   section and (2) continuing slow LOHS due to the chemical species cascade
   throughout the plant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation-based design optimization utilizes computational models that
   rely on assumptions and approximations. There is a need therefore, to
   ensure that the obtained designs will exhibit the desired behavior as
   anticipated given the model predictions. The common approach to
   accomplish that is to validate the utilized computational models prior
   to the design optimization process. However, this is practically an
   impossible task especially for design problems with high-dimensional
   design and parameter spaces. We have recently proposed a different
   approach for maximizing confidence in the designs generated during a
   sequential simulation-based optimization process based on calibrating
   the computational models when necessary and within local subdomains of
   the design space. In that work, the size of the local domains was held
   fixed and not linked to uncertainty, and the confidence in designs was
   quantified using Bayesian hypothesis testing. In this article, we
   present an improved methodology. Specifically, we use a statistical
   methodology to account for uncertainty and to determine the size of the
   local domains at each stage of the sequential design optimization
   process using parametric bootstrapping that involves maximum likelihood
   estimators of model parameters. The sequential process continues until
   the local domain does not change from stage to stage during the design
   optimization process, ensuring convergence to an optimal design. The
   proposed methodology is illustrated with the design of a thermal
   insulator using one-dimensional, linear heat conduction in a solid slab
   with heat flux boundary conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of new materials and processes to microfabrication has,
   in large part, enabled many important advances in microsystems, lab-on-
   a-chip devices, and their applications. In particular, capabilities for
   cost-effective fabrication of polymer microstructures were transformed
   by the advent of soft lithography and other micromolding techniques (1,
   2), and this led a revolution in applications of microfabrication to
   biomedical engineering and biology. Nevertheless, it remains challenging
   to fabricate microstructures with well-defined nanoscale surface
   textures, and to fabricate arbitrary 3D shapes at the micro-scale.
   Robustness of master molds and maintenance of shape integrity is
   especially important to achieve high fidelity replication of complex
   structures and preserving their nanoscale surface texture. The
   combination of hierarchical textures, and heterogeneous shapes, is a
   profound challenge to existing microfabrication methods that largely
   rely upon top-down etching using fixed mask templates. On the other
   hand, the bottom-up synthesis of nanostructures such as nanotubes and
   nanowires can offer new capabilities to microfabrication, in particular
   by taking advantage of the collective self-organization of
   nanostructures, and local control of their growth behavior with respect
   to microfabricated patterns.
   Our goal is to introduce vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs),
   which we refer to as CNT ``forests{''}, as a new microfabrication
   material. We present details of a suite of related methods recently
   developed by our group: fabrication of CNT forest microstructures by
   thermal CVD from lithographically patterned catalyst thin films;
   self-directed elastocapillary densification of CNT microstructures; and
   replica molding of polymer microstructures using CNT composite master
   molds. In particular, our work shows that self-directed capillary
   densification ({''}capillary forming{''}), which is performed by
   condensation of a solvent onto the substrate with CNT microstructures,
   significantly increases the packing density of CNTs. This process
   enables directed transformation of vertical CNT microstructures into
   straight, inclined, and twisted shapes, which have robust mechanical
   properties exceeding those of typical microfabrication polymers. This in
   turn enables formation of nanocomposite CNT master molds by
   capillary-driven infiltration of polymers. The replica structures
   exhibit the anisotropic nanoscale texture of the aligned CNTs, and can
   have walls with sub-micron thickness and aspect ratios exceeding 50:1.
   Integration of CNT microstructures in fabrication offers further
   opportunity to exploit the electrical and thermal properties of CNTs,
   and diverse capabilities for chemical and biochemical functionalization
   (3).}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of a monocrystalline ring comprised of a
   multiply-seeded, SX ring separated by low-angle boundaries was
   investigated for two thicknesses and two processing techniques. In
   particular, solidification experiments using 1.9- and 5.1-cm-thick
   tri-crystal castings were conducted in a furnace capable of either the
   Bridgman or liquid metal cooling (LMC) mode. LMC is a high-gradient
   directional solidification process that provides refinement of dendritic
   structure by submerging the casting in a liquid-metal-coolant bath upon
   withdrawal from the mold heater. The degree of structure refinement was
   investigated in these castings with varying cross-sectional areas.
   Solidification modeling was used to optimize process conditions and
   investigate the thermal characteristics of each process for both casting
   configurations. Predicted relationships between dendritic structure,
   cooling rate, and thermal gradients in the axial and transverse
   directions are presented. A model for the prediction of thermal behavior
   for Bridgman and LMC techniques using complex casting configurations
   with section-thickness variations, encompassing a broad range of thermal
   conditions, was validated. A viable processing route for a
   monocrystalline ring was identified using the LMC technique, which
   mitigates the detrimental effects of radiation view factors present in
   the Bridgman process. Solidification modeling identified the process
   conditions required to produce a new casting configuration with minimal
   casting trials.}},

Abstract = {{Karst is widely distributed in the southwest of China, especially in
   Guizhou Province. The phenomenon of desertification in these areas is
   very serious. And soil erosion is the key link in the process of
   desertification. Through field monitoring, underground soil leakage is
   derived to the main mode of soil loss in this area. Shear strength tests
   and creep experiments were carried out with the aim of analyzing the
   creep mechanism in underground soil loss. It is shown that the water
   content can lead to the great influence on the shear strength of the
   brown clay. This variation has been combined with creep characteristics
   besides the structural geology, hydrology condition and brown clay
   distribution circumstance (field observation). A conceptual creep model
   of the brown clay sliding along the karst conduits has been unveiled to
   show the detailed inference of the creep mechanism in the underground
   soil loss: geology and hydrology control the development of the karst
   conduit system; and penetration of water induces the weakening of the
   shear strength of the surface soil and accelerates the creeping and
   sliding of the brown clay along the karst conduit system. This
   understanding of the creep mechanism has significant implications for
   the future management of the soil erosion in the karst area.}},

Title = {{Turbulence profiles from a smooth flat-plate turbulent boundary layer at
   high Reynolds number}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{140-149}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Much is known about smooth-flat-plate turbulent boundary layers (TBLs)
   at laboratory-scale Reynolds numbers because of a wealth of experimental
   data. However, smooth-flat-plate TBL data are much less common at the
   high Reynolds numbers typical of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic
   applications (Re-x similar to 10(8)-10(10)), and at the even higher
   Reynolds numbers of many geophysical flows. This paper presents new
   LDV-measured profiles of the stream-wise velocity variance, the
   wall-normal velocity variance, and the Reynolds shear stress from the
   TBL that formed on a smooth flat plate at Karman numbers from 15,000 to
   60,000 (Rex from 75 million to 220 million). The experiments were
   conducted in the William B. Morgan Large Cavitation Channel on a
   polished (k(+) < 0.2) flat-plate test model 12.9 m long and 3.05 m wide
   at water flow speeds up to 20 m s(-1). The TBL on the model developed in
   a mild favorable pressure gradient having an acceleration parameter K
   similar to 10(-10). When plotted with the usual inner and outer
   scalings, the stream-wise velocity variance profiles display a Reynolds
   number dependence that is consistent with prior lower Reynolds-number
   zero-pressure-gradient TBL measurements. However, using the same
   normalizations, the profiles of wall-normal velocity variance and
   Reynolds shear stress are found to be Reynolds number independent, or
   nearly so, when experimental uncertainties are considered. (C) 2012

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{209}},
Pages = {{44-51}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Among different transition metal oxides cobalt oxide (Co3O4) has
   attracted considerable attention for supercapacitor applications because
   of its superior electrochemical characteristics at relatively low cost.
   Nanostructured Co3O4 electrodes are usually prepared from powders using
   sol-gel and hydrothermal techniques, which require multi-step procedures
   and longer processing times. Here, we report synthesis and
   characterization of Co3O4 supercapacitor electrode films deposited
   directly on current collectors via a single step solution precursor
   plasma spray route. In this approach, an aqueous solution containing
   cobalt acetate is axially fed into plasma plume to produce
   nanoparticulates of Co3O4 via accelerated thermo-chemical conversion
   process, which are eventually deposited on a current collector
   substrate. Thus, developed Co3O4 electrodes showed nano particulate
   structure with porosity. The phase structure and crystallinity of Co3O4
   electrode films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and differential
   scanning calorimetry-thermogravi merry (DSC-TGA) studies.
   Electrochemical performance of these coatings showed a specific
   capacitance of similar to 162 F g(-1) with a retention capacity of
   72.2\% after 1000 cycles for a specific current rate of 2.75 A g(-1) in

Title = {{Explaining state-to-state differences in seat belt use: A multivariate
   analysis of cultural variables}},

Abstract = {{There is considerable variation in seat belt use within the United
   States despite extensive evidence that the use of seat belts saves
   lives. Previous studies have identified some important factors that
   affect belt use rates, including gender, age, race, vehicle type,
   seat-belt enforcement laws, and amount of fine for belt-use law
   violation. In this study, we examined the influence of additional
   socio-demographic factors on state-level use rates: education
   (percentage of high school educated population), racial composition
   (percentage White), median household income, political leaning
   (percentage Democrat), and a measure of religiosity. These variables,
   which collectively characterize the `culture' of a state, have received
   little attention in seat-belt studies. The paper reports results from a
   multiple regression analysis of data from the 2008 Fatality Analysis
   Reporting System (FARS). Many of the use rate patterns in FARS data were
   consistent with those found in other data sets, suggesting that
   conclusions based on FARS data are likely to hold for the
   population-at-large. Of the five cultural factors considered in the
   study, three were identified as important in explaining the differences
   in seat belt use at the state level: religiosity, race (percentage
   White), and political leaning (percentage Democrat). The other two
   variables - income and education were not significant. Hold-out analyses
   confirmed that this conclusion was consistent across different subsets
   of data. The findings from this study are preliminary and have to be
   confirmed on other data sets. Nevertheless, they demonstrate the
   potential usefulness of cultural factors in explaining state-to-state
   variation in seat belt use rates. If factors such as religiosity are
   indeed important, they can be used to develop culturally appropriate
   programs for increasing belt use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{101-110}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper a multi-level system design (MLS) algorithm is presented
   and utilized for a wind turbine system analysis. The MLS guides the
   decision making process for designing a complex system where many
   alternatives and many mutually competing objectives and disciplines need
   to be considered and evaluated. Mathematical relationships between the
   design variables and the multiple discipline performance objectives are
   developed adaptively as the various design considerations are evaluated
   and as the design is being evolved. These relationships are employed for
   rewarding performance improvement during the decision making process by
   allocating more resources and influence to the disciplines which exhibit
   the improvement. Simulation tools developed by the National Renewable
   Energy Laboratory (NREL) are employed in the wind turbine design
   analysis. The Cost Of Energy (COE) comprises the overall system level
   objective, while performance improvements at two technical design
   disciplines are pursued at the same time. The optimal design of the
   blade geometry for maximum Annual Energy Production (AEP), and the
   structural design of the blade for minimum bending moment at the root of
   the blade comprise the two technical design disciplines. Scalar
   metamodels are developed for linking the design variables with the
   performance metrics associated with the design of the blade geometry.
   Main characteristics of the wind turbine, namely, the rotor diameter,
   the rotational speed, the maximum rated power, the hub height, the
   structural characteristics of the blade, and the geometric
   characteristics of the blade (distribution of thickness, twist angle,
   and chord) are employed as design variables for the overall design
   analysis. The optimization results and the physical insight which can be
   gained through a sensitivity analysis for the optimal configuration are
   presented and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An efficient approach to incorporating interfraction motion in IMRT
   treatment planning}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is one of the most widely
   used delivery modalities for radiation therapy for cancer patients. A
   patient is typically treated in daily fractions over a period of 5-9
   weeks. In this paper, we consider the problem of accounting for changes
   in patient setup location and internal geometry between the treatment
   fractions, usually referred to as interfraction motion. The conventional
   method is to add a margin around the clinical tumor volume (CTV) to
   obtain a planning target volume (PTV). A fluence map optimization (FMO)
   model is then solved to determine the optimal intensity profiles to
   deliver to the patient. However, a margin-based method may not
   adequately model the changes in dose distributions due to the random
   nature of organ motion. Accounting for interfraction motion in the FMO
   model essentially transforms the deterministic optimization problem into
   a stochastic one. We propose a stochastic FMO model that employs convex
   penalty functions to control the treatment plan quality and uses a large
   number of scenarios to characterize interfraction motion uncertainties.
   Some effects of radiotherapy are impacted mainly by the dose
   distribution in a given treatment fraction while others tend to manifest
   themselves over time and depend mostly on the total dose received over
   the course of treatment. We will therefore formulate an optimization
   model that explicitly incorporates treatment plan evaluation criteria
   that apply to the total dose received over all treatment fractions and
   ones that apply to the dose per fraction. Particularly when many
   structures fall into the former category, this can lead to significant
   reductions in the dimension of the optimization model and therefore the
   time required to solve it. We test an example of our model on five
   clinical prostate cancer cases, showing the efficacy of our approach. In
   particular, compared to a traditional margin-based treatment plan, our
   plans exhibit significantly improved target dose coverage and clinically
   equivalent critical structure sparing at only a modest increase in
   computational effort. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Number = {{26}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{Nonradiative triplets in fluorescent organic light emitting diodes
   (OLEDs) can lead to increased efficiency through triplet-triplet
   annihilation, or to decreased efficiency due to singlet-triplet
   annihilation. We study the tradeoff between the two processes from the
   electroluminescence transients of an OLED comprising a
   tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) doped rubrene emissive layer,
   whose emission spectrum peaks at a wavelength of 610 nm. The
   electroluminescent transients in the current density range, 4 m
   Lambda/cm(2) < J < 57 Lambda=cm(2), are modeled based on singlet and
   triplet density dynamics. Our analysis shows that triplets positively
   contribute to the OLED efficiency at J < 2.2 Lambda/cm(2), while
   decreasing the efficiency at higher J. The high OLED peak external
   quantum efficiency of 6.7\% and rapid efficiency roll-off with J are
   quantitatively explained by the tradeoff between triplet-triplet and
   singlet-triplet annihilation. The model suggests optimal materials
   properties needed for achieving high efficiency at high brightness in

Title = {{The 2012 Plasma Roadmap}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{25}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Low-temperature plasma physics and technology are diverse and
   interdisciplinary fields. The plasma parameters can span many orders of
   magnitude and applications are found in quite different areas of daily
   life and industrial production. As a consequence, the trends in
   research, science and technology are difficult to follow and it is not
   easy to identify the major challenges of the field and their many
   sub-fields. Even for experts the road to the future is sometimes lost in
   the mist. Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics is addressing this need
   for clarity and thus providing guidance to the field by this special
   Review article, The 2012 Plasma Roadmap.
   Although roadmaps are common in the microelectronic industry and other
   fields of research and development, constructing a roadmap for the field
   of low-temperature plasmas is perhaps a unique undertaking. Realizing
   the difficulty of this task for any individual, the plasma section of
   the Journal of Physics D Board decided to meet the challenge of
   developing a roadmap through an unusual and novel concept. The roadmap
   was divided into 16 formalized short subsections each addressing a
   particular key topic. For each topic a renowned expert in the sub-field
   was invited to express his/her individual visions on the status, current
   and future challenges, and to identify advances in science and
   technology required to meet these challenges.
   Together these contributions form a detailed snapshot of the current
   state of the art which clearly shows the lifelines of the field and the
   challenges ahead. Novel technologies, fresh ideas and concepts, and new
   applications discussed by our authors demonstrate that the road to the
   future is wide and far reaching. We hope that this special plasma
   science and technology roadmap will provide guidance for colleagues,
   funding agencies and government institutions. If successful in doing so,
   the roadmap will be periodically updated to continue to help in guiding
   the field.}},

Abstract = {{Walking on an irregular surface is associated with an elevated risk for
   a fall at any age. Yet, relatively little is known about how a human
   responds to an unexpected underfoot perturbation during gait. This is
   partly due to the difficulty of generating an intermittent but
   repeatable, unexpected, underfoot perturbation whose size and location
   are precisely known. So we developed a shoe sole-embedded apparatus for
   randomly perturbing the stance phase of gait. Medial and lateral flaps
   were concealed in the soles of pairs of sandals, along with their
   actuators. Either flap could be deployed within 400 ms in the
   parasagittal plane under a swing foot; this altered the resulting
   sagittal and frontal plane orientations of the foot during the next
   stance phase, whereafter the flap was retracted following toe-off for
   the rest of that gait trial. We tested six healthy young subjects by
   randomly presenting a single medial or lateral perturbation in 12 of 30
   gait trials. Traditional step kinematic measures were used to evaluate
   the test-retest reliability of the response to the stimulus at two
   different walking speeds in 60 randomized trials conducted 1 week apart.
   The method was effective in systematically inducing an alteration in
   gait, reproducible across visits, as evidenced by acceptable intraclass
   correlation coefficients for step width, time and length. We conclude
   that the apparatus and method has potential for measuring the ability of
   humans to reject one or more unexpected underfoot perturbations during
   gait. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate how to tailor the spatial distribution of gold
   nanoparticles (Au-NPs) of different sizes within polystyrene (PS) thin,
   supported, film hosts, thereby enabling the connection between the
   spatial distribution of Au-NPs within the polymer film and the optical
   properties to be determined. The real, n, and imaginary parts, k, of the
   complex refractive indices N = n(lambda)+ik(lambda) of the nanocomposite
   films were measured as a function of wavelength, lambda, using
   multivariable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. The surface plasmon
   response of films containing nearly homogeneous Au-NP distributions were
   well described by predictions based on classical Mie theory and the
   Drude model. The optical spectra of samples containing inhomogeneous
   nanoparticle distributions manifest features associated with differences
   in the size and interparticle spacings as well as the proximity and
   organization of nanoparticles at the substrate and free surface.}},

Abstract = {{The liquid repellency and surface topography characteristics of coatings
   comprising a sprayed-on mixture of fluoroalkyl-functional precipitated
   silica and a fluoropolymer binder were examined using contact and
   sliding angle analysis, electron microscopy, and image analysis for
   determination of fractal dimensionality. The coatings proved to be an
   especially useful class of liquid repellent materials due to their
   combination of simple and scalable deposition process, low surface
   energy, and the roughness characteristics of the aggregates. These
   characteristics interact in a unique way to prevent the buildup of
   binder in interstitial regions, preserving re-entrant curvature across
   multiple length scales, thereby enabling a wide range of liquid
   repellency, including superoleophobicity. In addition, rather than
   accumulating in the interstices, the binder becomes widely distributed
   across the surface of the aggregates, enabling a mechanism in which a
   simple shortage or excess of binder controls the extent of coating
   roughness at very small length scales, thereby controlling the extent of
   liquid repellence.}},

   sensitive to f and N-arm. Regions of the films in proximity to
   interfaces age at substantially different rates than the interior of the

   circuits and the dissipative charge transporting devices. Here, we
   report the fabrication of an ambipolar transistor using tin mono-oxide

   field-effect mobilities. A complementary metal oxide semiconductor-like
   inverter using the SnO dual operation transistors is demonstrated with a
   maximum gain up to 30 and long-term air stability. Such logic device
   configuration would simplify the circuit design and fabrication process,
   offering more opportunities for designing and constructing oxide-based
   logic circuits. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Structural controllability has been proposed as an analytical framework
   for making predictions regarding the control of complex networks across
   myriad disciplines in the physical and life sciences (Liu et al.,
   Nature: 473(7346):167-173, 2011). Although the integration of control
   theory and network analysis is important, we argue that the application
   of the structural controllability framework to most if not all
   real-world networks leads to the conclusion that a single control input,
   applied to the power dominating set, is all that is needed for
   structural controllability. This result is consistent with the
   well-known fact that controllability and its dual observability are
   generic properties of systems. We argue that more important than issues
   of structural controllability are the questions of whether a system is
   almost uncontrollable, whether it is almost unobservable, and whether it
   possesses almost pole-zero cancellations.}},

Abstract = {{The long turnaround time in antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST)
   endangers patients and encourages the administration of wide spectrum
   antibiotics, thus resulting in alarming increases of multidrug resistant
   pathogens. A method for faster detection of bacterial proliferation
   presents one avenue toward addressing this global concern. We report on
   a label-free asynchronous magnetic bead rotation (AMBR) based viscometry
   method that rapidly detects bacterial growth and determines drug
   sensitivity by measuring changes in the suspension's viscosity. With
   this platform, we observed the growth of a uropathogenic Escherichia
   coli isolate, with an initial concentration of 50 cells per drop, within
   20 min; in addition, we determined the gentamicin minimum inhibitory
   concentration (MIC) of the E. coli isolate within 100 min. We thus
   demonstrated a label-free, microviscometer platform that can measure
   bacterial growth and drug susceptibility more rapidly, with lower
   initial bacterial counts than existing commercial systems, and
   potentially with any microbial strains.}},

Abstract = {{Copper, iron, and mixed copper/iron exchanged zeolites containing ZSM-5
   and chabazite-like zeolites (SSZ-13, SAPO-18 and SAPO-34) were studied
   for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH3 with or without
   propene. Cu/ZSM-5, Cu/SSZ-13, Cu/SAPO-18 and Cu/SAPO-34 exhibited high
   NO conversions without propene. However, as compared to Cu/ZSM-5, NO
   conversions over Cu/SSZ-13, Cu/SAPO-18 and Cu/SAPO-34 were more stable
   with propene, due to coke formation over Cu/ZSM-5. The results of
   N-2-adsorption/desorption and XPS showed that the surface area, Cu+/Cu2+
   ratio and the surface amount of Cu content of Cu/ZSM-5 catalysts changed
   from 324 m(2)/g, 0.03 and 11.5 wt\% for the fresh Cu/ZSM-5 catalyst to
   68 m(2)/g, 0.34 and 5.3 wt\% for the used sample. However, there were
   little changes between fresh and used Cu/SSZ-13, Cu/SAPO-18 and
   Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts. Moreover, Cu/ZSM-5 catalyst showed a larger
   decline in NO conversion with time on stream and a higher adsorption
   amount of propene compared to Cu/SSZ-13, Cu/SAPO-18 and Cu/SAPO-34
   catalysts. The resistance to hydrocarbon poisoning depended on the pore
   geometry of the zeolites. During NH3-SCR, the presence of medium-pore
   sizes in Cu/ZSM-5 led to hydrocarbon deposition, which blocked the
   active sites and also decreased the active intermediates needed for NO
   conversion. Cu/SSZ-13, Cu/SAPO-18 and Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts, on the other
   hand, with small pores and cage diameters and with one-dimensional
   channel structures, showed higher hydrocarbon poison resistance.
   Moreover, these copper exchanged small-pore zeolites showed much higher
   hydrothermal stability than the medium-pore Cu/ZSM-5. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fracture experiments were carried out on continuous fiber polymer matrix
   laminated composite panels to investigate cohesive,

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the buckling of thick sandwich panels with
   orthotropic elastic face sheets bonded to a linear elastic orthotropic
   core. When such panels are analyzed for axial load carrying capacity, it
   is now commonplace to adopt the finite element method to carry out
   computations. The accuracy of the numerical results will depend not only
   on roundoff and algorithmic errors, but additionally on the
   approximations made in computing the incremental (second order) work
   associated in computing the change of configuration from the unbuckled
   to the buckled state. Here we show that, particularly for orthotropic
   thick sandwich structures, large errors can be incurred in computing
   buckling loads with available commercial software, unless the proper
   work conjugate measures of stress and strain with their stress-dependent
   tangential moduli are used in the buckling formulation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Stem cells have a host of applications in regenerative medicine and
   basic research. However, clinical translation hinges on the availability
   of effective stem cell expansion. Stem cell expansion has been limited
   due to the use of xenogenic factors in the culture system,
   batch-to-batch variation, and processes that do not readily lend
   themselves to scale-up. Synthetic substrates represent attractive
   alternatives to standard feeder layer culture, as they address many of
   these pressing limitations. Specifically, vie use a grafting-to approach
   to create a zwitterionic hydrogel capable of maintaining human
   pluripotent stem cells in long-term culture. This approach enables the
   control of substrate physiochemical properties, is relatively
   inexpensive, and results in a substrate with good storage and
   sterilization stability. In this feature, we focus on the contributions
   of our culture system to prolonged stem cell culture and compare it to
   other culture systems currently available. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{6222-6227}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{Carbamazepine is one of the most persistent pharmaceutical compounds in
   wastewater effluents due to its resistance to biodegradation-based
   conventional treatment. Advanced oxidation can efficiently degrade
   carbamazepine, but the toxicity and persistence of the oxidation
   products may be more relevant than the parent. This study sets out to
   determine whether the products of advanced oxidation of carbamazepine
   can be biotransformed and ultimately mineralized by developing a novel
   methodology to assess these sequential treatment processes. The
   methodology traces the transformation products of the C-14-labeled
   carbamazepine during UV/hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation and
   subsequent biotransformation by mixed, undefined cultures using liquid
   scintillation counting and liquid chromatography with radioactivity,
   mass spectrometry, and UV detectors. The results show that the oxidation
   byproducts of carbamazepine containing a hydroxyl or carbonyl group can
   be fully mineralized by a mixed bacterial inoculum. A tertiary treatment
   approach that includes oxidation and biotransformation has the potential
   to synergistically mineralize persistent pharmaceutical compounds in
   wastewater treatment plant effluents. The methodology developed for this
   study can be applied to assess the mineralization potential of other
   persistent organic contaminants.}},

Title = {{The role of complementary bipartite visual analytical representations in
   the analysis of SNPs: a case study in ancestral informative markers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{E1}},
Pages = {{E5-E12}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective Several studies have shown how sets of single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) can help to classify subjects on the basis of their
   continental origins, with applications to case-control studies and
   population genetics. However, most of these studies use
   dimensionality-reduction methods, such as principal component analysis,
   or clustering methods that result in unipartite (either subjects or
   SNPs) representations of the data. Such analyses conceal important
   bipartite relationships, such as how subject and SNP clusters relate to
   each other, and the genotypes that determine their cluster memberships.
   Methods To overcome the limitations of current methods of analyzing SNP
   data, the authors used three bipartite analytical representations
   (bipartite network, heat map with dendrograms, and Circos ideogram) that
   enable the simultaneous visualization and analysis of subjects, SNPs,
   and subject attributes.
   Results The results demonstrate (1) novel insights into SNP data that
   are difficult to derive from purely unipartite views of the data, (2)
   the strengths and limitations of each method, revealing the role that
   each play in revealing novel insights, and (3) implications for how the
   methods can be used for the analysis of SNPs in genomic studies
   associated with disease.
   Conclusion The results suggest that bipartite representations can reveal
   new patterns in SNP data compared with existing unipartite
   representations. However, the novel insights require multiple
   representations to discover, verify, and comprehend the complex
   relationships. The results therefore motivate the need for a
   complementary visual analytical framework that guides the use of
   multiple bipartite representations to analyze complex relationships in
   SNP data.}},

   encapsulation, mineral admixtures, chemical in glass tubing, and
   intrinsic healing with self-controlled tight crack width, are evaluated
   against the robustness criteria. It is suggested that while significant

Abstract = {{Otoacoustic emissions are an indicator of a normally functioning cochlea
   and as such are a useful tool for non-invasive diagnosis as well as for
   understanding cochlear function. While these emitted waves are
   hypothesized to arise from active processes and exit through the
   cochlear fluids, neither the precise mechanism by which these emissions
   are generated nor the transmission pathway is completely known. With
   regard to the acoustic pathway, two competing hypotheses exist to
   explain the dominant mode of emission. One hypothesis, the
   backward-traveling wave hypothesis, posits that the emitted wave
   propagates as a coupled fluid-structure wave while the alternate
   hypothesis implicates a fast, compressional wave in the fluid as the
   main mechanism of energy transfer. In this paper, we study the acoustic
   pathway for transmission of energy from the inside of the cochlea to the
   outside through a physiologically-based theoretical model. Using a
   well-defined, compact source of internal excitation, we predict that the
   emission is dominated by a backward traveling fluid-structure wave.
   However, in an active model of the cochlea, a forward traveling wave
   basal to the location of the force is possible in a limited region
   around the best place. Finally, the model does predict the dominance of
   compressional waves under a different excitation, such as an apical
   excitation. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{Most hardware neural networks have a basic competitive learning rule on
   top of a more involved processing algorithm. This work highlights two
   basic learning rules/behavior: winner-take-all (WTA) and

   implementing WTA combined with STDP in a position detector. A
   complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and a memristor-MOS
   technology (MMOST) design simulation results are compared on the bases
   of power, area, and noise handling capabilities. Design and layout were
   done in 130-nm IBM process for CMOS, and the HSPICE model files for the
   process were used to simulate the CMOS part of the MMOST design. CMOS
   consumes 2.9 x 10(-4) cm(2) area, 55-mu W max power, and requires a 3-dB
   SNR. On the other hand, the MMOST design consumes 6 x 10(-5) cm(2),

Title = {{Inverse-optimized 3D conformal planning: Minimizing complexity while
   achieving equivalence with beamlet IMRT in multiple clinical sites}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Inverse planned intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
   has helped many centers implement highly conformal treatment planning
   with beamlet-based techniques. The many comparisons between IMRT and 3D
   conformal (3DCRT) plans, however, have been limited because most 3DCRT
   plans are forward-planned while IMRT plans utilize inverse planning,
   meaning both optimization and delivery techniques are different. This
   work avoids that problem by comparing 3D plans generated with a unique
   inverse planning method for 3DCRT called inverse-optimized 3D (IO-3D)
   conformal planning. Since IO-3D and the beamlet IMRT to which it is
   compared use the same optimization techniques, cost functions, and plan
   evaluation tools, direct comparisons between IMRT and simple, optimized
   IO-3D plans are possible. Though IO-3D has some similarity to direct
   aperture optimization (DAO), since it directly optimizes the apertures
   used, IO-3D is specifically designed for 3DCRT fields (i.e., 1-2
   apertures per beam) rather than starting with IMRT-like modulation and
   then optimizing aperture shapes. The two algorithms are very different
   in design, implementation, and use. The goals of this work include using
   IO-3D to evaluate how close simple but optimized IO-3D plans come to
   nonconstrained beamlet IMRT, showing that optimization, rather than
   modulation, may be the most important aspect of IMRT (for some sites).
   Methods: The IO-3D dose calculation and optimization functionality is
   integrated in the in-house 3D planning/optimization system. New features
   include random point dose calculation distributions, costlet and cost
   function capabilities, fast dose volume histogram (DVH) and plan
   evaluation tools, optimization search strategies designed for IO-3D, and
   an improved, reimplemented edge/octree calculation algorithm. The IO-3D
   optimization, in distinction to DAO, is designed to optimize 3D
   conformal plans (one to two segments per beam) and optimizes MLC segment
   shapes and weights with various user-controllable search strategies
   which optimize plans without beamlet or pencil beam approximations.
   IO-3D allows comparisons of beamlet, multisegment, and conformal plans
   optimized using the same cost functions, dose points, and plan
   evaluation metrics, so quantitative comparisons are straightforward.
   Here, comparisons of IO-3D and beamlet IMRT techniques are presented for
   breast, brain, liver, and lung plans.
   Results: IO-3D achieves high quality results comparable to beamlet IMRT,
   for many situations. Though the IO-3D plans have many fewer degrees of
   freedom for the optimization, this work finds that IO-3D plans with only
   one to two segments per beam are dosimetrically equivalent (or nearly
   so) to the beamlet IMRT plans, for several sites. IO-3D also reduces
   plan complexity significantly. Here, monitor units per fraction (MU/Fx)
   for IO-3D plans were 22\%-68\% less than that for the 1 cm x 1 cm
   beamlet IMRT plans and 72\%-84\% than the 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm beamlet IMRT
   plans.
   Conclusions: The unique IO-3D algorithm illustrates that inverse
   planning can achieve high quality 3D conformal plans equivalent (or
   nearly so) to unconstrained beamlet IMRT plans, for many sites. IO-3D
   thus provides the potential to optimize flat or few-segment 3DCRT plans,
   creating less complex optimized plans which are efficient and simple to
   deliver. The less complex IO-3D plans have operational advantages for
   scenarios including adaptive replanning, cases with interfraction and
   intrafraction motion, and pediatric patients. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Purpose: To introduce a method to efficiently identify and calculate
   meaningful tradeoffs between criteria in an interactive IMRT treatment
   planning procedure. The method provides a systematic approach to
   developing high-quality radiation therapy treatment plans.
   Methods: Treatment planners consider numerous dosimetric criteria of
   varying importance that, when optimized simultaneously through
   multicriteria optimization, yield a Pareto frontier which represents the
   set of Pareto-optimal treatment plans. However, generating and
   navigating this frontier is a time-consuming, nontrivial process. A
   lexicographic ordering (LO) approach to IMRT uses a physician's criteria
   preferences to partition the treatment planning decisions into a
   multistage treatment planning model. Because the relative importance of
   criteria optimized in the different stages may not necessarily
   constitute a strict prioritization, the authors introduce an interactive
   process, sensitivity analysis in lexicographic ordering (SALO), to allow
   the treatment planner control over the relative sequential-stage
   tradeoffs. By allowing this flexibility within a structured process,
   SALO implicitly restricts attention to and allows exploration of a
   subset of the Pareto efficient frontier that the physicians have deemed
   most important.
   Results: Improvements to treatment plans over a LO approach were found
   by implementing the SALO procedure on a brain case and a prostate case.
   In each stage, a physician assessed the tradeoff between previous stage
   and current stage criteria. The SALO method provided critical tradeoff
   information through curves approximating the relationship between
   criteria, which allowed the physician to determine the most desirable
   treatment plan.
   Conclusions: The SALO procedure provides treatment planners with a
   directed, systematic process to treatment plan selection. By following a
   physician's prioritization, the treatment planner can avoid wasting
   effort considering clinically inferior treatment plans. The planner is
   guided by criteria importance, but given the information necessary to
   accurately adjust the relative importance at each stage. Through these
   attributes, the SALO procedure delivers an approach well balanced
   between efficiency and flexibility. (C) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{This descriptive study was intended to measure the percentage of the
   time that patient beds were kept in high position in an adult acute
   inpatient surgical unit with medical overflow in a community hospital in
   Michigan, United States. The percentage of the time was calculated for

   It is recognized that this study was unable to differentiate whether
   those times patient beds being kept in a high position were appropriate
   for an elevated bed height (e.g., staff were working with the patient).
   Further research is warranted. Falls committees may conduct high-bed

   amorphization occurred, but the size of the amorphous regions within the
   tracks decreased as smaller cations (higher Z) occupied the A-site. This
   decrease in the amorphous domain size is attributed primarily to
   epitaxial recrystallization of a disordered phase at the outer edge of
   the tracks, the stability of which is related to the ratio of the ionic
   radii of the A- and B-site (B = Ti) cations. While similar ion track
   recrystallization phenomena have been observed in pyrochlores of varying
   composition, A(2)TiO(5) is unique in that the disordered phase is not a
   high-temperature polymorph, suggesting kinetic control of the
   radiation-induced transformation. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Multiphase flows are ubiquitous in our daily life and engineering
   applications. It is important to investigate the flow structures to
   predict their dynamical behaviors effectively. Lagrangian coherent
   structures (LCS) defined by the ridges of the finite-time Lyapunov
   exponent (FTLE) is utilized in this study to elucidate the multiphase
   interactions in gaseous jets injected into water and time-dependent
   turbulent cavitation under the framework of Navier-Stokes flow
   computations.
   For the gaseous jets injected into water, the highlighted phenomena of
   the jet transportation can be observed by the LCS method, including
   expansion, bulge, necking/breaking, and back-attack. Besides, the
   observation of the LCS reveals that the back-attack phenomenon arises
   from the fact that the injected gas has difficulties to move toward
   downstream region after the necking/breaking. For the turbulent
   cavitating flow, the ridge of the FTLE field can form a LCS to capture
   the front and boundary of the re-entraint jet when the adverse pressure
   gradient is strong enough. It represents a barrier between particles
   trapped inside the circulation region and those moving downstream. The
   results indicate that the FTLE field has the potential to identify the
   structures of multiphase flows, and the LCS can capture the
   interface/barrier or the vortex/circulation region.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents first time application of the Performance-Based
   Plastic Design (PBPD) approach to seismic resistant reinforced concrete
   special moment frames (RC SMF). Four baseline RC SMF (4, 8, 12 and
   20-story) as used in the FEMA P695 were selected for this study. Those
   frames were redesigned by the PBPD approach. The baseline code designed
   frames and the PBPD frames were subjected to extensive inelastic
   pushover and time-history analyses. It turns out that the work-energy
   equation in PBPD to determine design base shear can also be used to
   estimate seismic demands, herein called the energy spectrum method. In
   summary, this study shows that the PBPD approach can be successfully
   applied for seismic design of RC structures as well. The seismic
   responses of the study frames met the targeted performance criteria with
   dramatic improvement over the corresponding baseline code designed
   frames. In addition, the drift demands of all study frames as computed
   by the energy spectrum method were in excellent agreement with those
   obtained from detailed inelastic dynamic analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The production of high-performance carbon nanotube (CNT) materials
   demands understanding of the growth behavior of individual CNTs as well
   as collective effects among CNTs. We demonstrate the first use of
   grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering to monitor in real time
   the synthesis of CNT films by chemical vapor deposition. We use a
   custom-built cold-wall reactor along with a high-speed pixel array
   detector resulting in a time resolution of 10 msec. Quantitative models
   applied to time-resolved X-ray scattering patterns reveal that the Fe
   catalyst film first rapidly dewets into well-defined hemispherical
   particles during heating in a reducing atmosphere, and then the
   particles coarsen slowly upon continued annealing. After introduction of
   the carbon source, the initial CNT diameter distribution closely matches
   that of the catalyst particles. However, significant changes In CNT
   diameter can occur quickly during the subsequent CNT self-organization
   process. Correlation of time-resolved orientation data to X-ray
   scattering intensity and height kinetics suggests that the rate of
   self-organization is driven by both the CNT growth rate and density, and
   vertical CNT growth begins abruptly when CNT alignment reaches a
   critical threshold. The dynamics of CNT size evolution and
   self-organization vary according to the catalyst annealing conditions
   and substrate temperature. Knowledge of these intrinsically rapid
   processes is vital to improve control of CNT structure and to enable
   efficient manufacturing of high-density arrays of long, straight CNTs.}},

Abstract = {{Human development and electrical energy. co-exist seamlessly in high
   Human Development Index (HDI) countries(1) where reliability and
   availability of electricity is greater than 95\%. In numerous low HDI
   countries,(2) there is 5-50\% electric grid availability. These electric
   grids can have reliability below 50\% due. to faults and extreme load
   shedding. Unavailable and unreliable electric grid events are situations
   disconnected from a centralized grid (if the grid fails then it is
   off-line). In Africa, renewable energy portfolios include solar, wind,
   biomass, biogas, small hydroelectric power and recently nuclear energy
   (MEMD, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009) and are cited to meet the disconnected
   grid situations. However, Human Power (HP) is a missing portfolio option
   and, if implemented in countries with average electrical power consumed
   below 20 W/Capita, would impact human development directly. The
   technologies include merry-go-round generators in schools, hand crank
   lighting in hospitals and health clinics during electricity outages and
   bicycle generators for off-grid businesses. This result is derived from
   (1) a new energy concept defined as PACE (People-based Activities
   Caloric Energy), (2) estimations from children's play - energy
   harvesting as free energy (3) disconnected-grid fuel costs for petrol
   and diesel generators, and (4) policy empowerment which is based on
   designing and building microgrids. These designs result from an
   innovative Physics and Business of Energy (PBE) curriculum, in
   conjunction with University of Michigan (USA), taught in Uganda at
   Mountains of the Moon University, Makerere University and St. Joseph's
   Technical Institute with an association called Uganda Small Scale
   Industries Association (USSIA). The HP-module is part of a multi-module
   curriculum for Empowering Ugandans to Power Uganda. The overall
   educational and design policies create a key missing gateway to
   co-designed and locally built microgrids. These policies are applicable
   in many, if not all,. low HDI countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) allows unlicensed users to access the licensed
   spectrum opportunistically (i.e., when the spectrum is left unused by
   the licensed users) to enhance the spectrum utilization efficiency. In
   this paper, the problem of allocating resources (channels and
   transmission power) in multihop CR networks is modeled as a
   multicommodity flow problem with the dynamic link capacity resulting
   from dynamic resource allocation, which is in sharp contrast with
   existing flow-control approaches that assume fixed link capacity. Based
   on queue-balancing network flow control that is ideally suited for
   handling dynamically changing spectrum availability in CR networks, we
   propose a distributed scheme (installed and operational in each node)
   for optimal resource allocation without exchanging spectrum dynamics
   information between remote nodes. Considering the power masks, each node
   makes resource-allocation decisions based on current or past local
   information from neighboring nodes to satisfy the throughput requirement
   of each flow. Parameters of these proposed schemes are configured to
   maintain the network stability. The performance of the proposed scheme
   for both asynchronous and synchronous scenarios is analyzed
   comparatively. Both cases of sufficient and insufficient network
   capacity are considered.}},

Abstract = {{The topic of multifunctional material systems using active or smart
   materials has recently gained attention in the research community.
   Multifunctional piezoelectric systems present the ability to combine
   multiple functions into a single active piezoelectric element, namely,
   combining sensing, actuation, or energy conversion ability with
   load-bearing capacity. Quantification of the bending strength of various
   piezoelectric materials is, therefore, critical in the development of
   load-bearing piezoelectric systems. Three-point bend tests are carried
   out on a variety of piezoelectric ceramics including soft monolithic
   piezoceramics (PZT-5A and PZT-5H), hard monolithic ceramics (PZT-4 and
   PZT-8), single-crystal piezoelectrics (PMN-PT and PMN-PZT), and
   commercially packaged composite devices (which contain active PZT-5A
   layers). A common 3-point bend test procedure is used throughout the
   experimental tests. The bending strengths of these materials are found
   using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to be 44.9 MPa for PMN-PZT, 60.6 MPa
   for PMN-PT, 114.8 MPa for PZT-5H, 123.2 MPa for PZT-4, 127.5 MPa for
   PZT-8, 140.4 MPa for PZT-5A, and 186.6 MPa for the commercial composite.
   The high strength of the commercial configuration is a result of the
   composite structure that allows for shear stresses on the surfaces of
   the piezoelectric layers, whereas the low strength of the single-crystal
   materials is due to their unique crystal structure, which allows for
   rapid propagation of cracks initiating at flaw sites. The experimental
   bending strength results reported, which are linear estimates without
   nonlinear ferroelastic considerations, are intended for use in the
   design of multifunctional piezoelectric systems in which the active
   device is subjected to bending loads.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy is a cavitation-based ultrasound therapy that mechanically
   fractionates soft solid tissues into fluid-like homogenates. This paper
   investigates the feasibility of imaging the tissue elasticity change
   during the histotripsy process as a tool to provide feedback for the
   treatments. The treatments were performed on agar tissue phantoms and ex
   vivo kidneys using 3-cycle ultrasound pulses delivered by a 750-kHz
   therapeutic array at peak negative/positive pressure of 17/108 MPa and a
   repetition rate of 50 Hz. Lesions with different degrees of damage were
   created with increasing numbers of therapy pulses from 0 to 2000 pulses
   per treatment location. The elasticity of the lesions was measured with
   ultrasound shear wave elastography, in which a quasi-planar shear wave
   was induced by acoustic radiation force generated by the therapeutic
   array, and tracked with ultrasound imaging at 3000 frames per second.
   Based on the shear wave velocity calculated from the sequentially
   captured frames, the Young's modulus was reconstructed. Results showed
   that the lesions were more easily identified on the shear wave velocity
   images than on B-mode images. As the number of therapy pulses increased
   from 0 to 2000 pulses/location, the Young's modulus decreased
   exponentially from 22.1 +/- 2.7 to 2.1 +/- 1.1 kPa in the tissue
   phantoms (R-2 = 0.99, N = 9 each), and from 33.0 +/- 7.1 to 4.0 +/- 2.5
   kPa in the ex vivo kidneys (R-2 = 0.99, N = 8 each). Correspondingly,
   the tissues transformed from completely intact to completely
   fractionated as examined via histology. A good correlation existed
   between the lesions' Young's modulus and the degree of tissue
   fractionation as examined with the percentage of remaining structurally
   intact cell nuclei (R-2 = 0.91, N = 8 each). These results indicate that
   lesions produced by histotripsy can be detected with high sensitivity
   using shear wave elastography. Because the decrease in the tissue
   elasticity corresponded well with the morphological and histological
   change, this study provides a basis for predicting the local treatment
   outcomes from tissue elasticity change.}},

Abstract = {{The constitutive behavior of bovine scleral and corneal tissues is
   measured in tension and compression, at quasi-static and moderate strain
   rates. Experiments are conducted at strain rates up to about 50 strain
   per second by a pneumatic testing system developed to overcome noise and
   measurement difficulties associated with the time dependent test of low
   impedance materials. Results for the tissues at room and the natural
   bovine body temperatures are similar and indicate that ocular tissue
   exhibits nonlinear stiffening for increasing strain rates, a phenomena
   termed rate hardening. For example, at a tensile strain rate of 29/s,
   corneal tissue is found to develop 10 times the stress that it does
   quasi-statically at the same strain. Thus, conventional constitutive
   models will grossly underpredict stresses occurring in the
   corneo-scleral shell due to moderate dynamic events. This has
   implication to the accuracy of ocular injury models, the study of the
   stress field in the corneo-scleral shell for glaucoma research and
   tonometry measurements. The measured data at various strain rates is
   represented using the general framework of a constitutive model that has
   been used to represent biological tissue mechanical data. Here it is
   extended to represent the measured data of the ocular tissues over the
   range of tested strain rates. Its form allows for straightforward
   incorporation in various numerical codes. The experimental and
   analytical methods developed here are felt to be applicable to the test
   of human ocular tissue. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006847]}},

Abstract = {{With the growth in power demand of high-energy weapon systems and
   mission modules, the required power density and energy density of power
   generation and energy storage modules must also increase. The objectives
   of this project are: (1) perform a sensitivity study to compare the
   increase in power demand of high energy weapons with the projected
   increases in capacities of Power Generation Modules (PGMs) and Energy
   Storage Modules (ESMs), (2) discuss the challenges associated with
   incorporating high energy weapons aboard a notional surface combatant,
   and (3) identify current technology gaps in order to fully integrate a
   suite of high energy weapons and mission systems onto a notional surface
   combatant and meet the operational requirements.
   To establish a baseline for the case study, results are compared to a
   notional naval surface combatant that can currently generate
   approximately 80 MW of total power. The power is generated using
   four-to-five gas turbines based on a traditional mechanical
   architecture, which does not utilize ESMs. The separate PGMs for the
   propulsion and ship service systems of a traditional mechanical
   architecture, and the lack of ESMs, severely limit the maximum power
   that can be used to support high-energy weapons. Therefore, an
   all-electric architecture is considered in the current study, which
   utilizes an integrated power system (IPS) architecture that distributes
   the power to the propulsion, ship services, and mission systems via a
   centralized supply. Current results show that the power capacity of gas
   turbines will increase by approximately 16\% by 2030. The power density
   and energy density of various ESMs are projected to increase as well.
   Lithium ion batteries are predicted to increase their specific energy by
   50\%, and flywheels are predicted to double their specific energy.
   Comparisons of the various combinations of high-energy weapons that can
   be supported aboard a notional naval surface combatant as a function of
   speed will be presented, along with identification of technology gaps
   that may restrict the ability of future vessels to meet the desired
   concepts of operations. The results demonstrate the need to
   significantly increase the power density of PGMs, as well as power
   density and energy density of ESMs, in order to meet the operational
   requirements of future naval combatants.}},

Abstract = {{While diffusion as the major mechanism for wax deposition has been
   investigated in past decades, wax gelation has mostly been studied in
   quiescent conditions and is considered to be less significant than
   diffusion in flow conditions. In this study, gelation has been observed
   as a major mechanism for the formation of wax deposits in oil/water
   stratified flow. The experiments are carried out in a state-of-the-art
   flow loop using a North Sea gas condensate and formation water. The flow
   map study using reflex camera and X-ray tomography reveals that most of
   the completely stratified flows occur at low total flow rates of oil and
   water, which correspond to low shear stresses at the wall. It was found
   that the carbon number distributions of the wax deposits formed in this
   region have very low fractions of heavy components and are very close to
   the distribution of the deposit that is only formed by gelation. It was
   further revealed that the deposit thickness increases with increasing
   degree of gelation, which corresponds to decreasing shear stress of the
   fluids at the wall. This finding is consistent with previous studies
   from single-phase experiments where lower oil velocities are found to
   result in much higher deposit thicknesses and low wax fractions in the
   deposits.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Spectral analysis of the radiofrequency (RF) signals that
   underlie grayscale EUS images has been used to provide quantitative,
   objective information about tissue histology.
   Objective: Our purpose was to validate RF spectral analysis as a method
   to distinguish between chronic pancreatitis (CP) and pancreatic cancer
   (PC).
   Design and Setting: A prospective study of eligible patients was
   conducted to analyze the RF data obtained by using electronic array
   echoendoscopes.
   Patients: Pancreatic images were obtained by using electronic array
   echoendoscopes from 41 patients in a prospective study, including 15
   patients with PC, 15 with CP, and 11 with a normal pancreas.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Midband fit, slope, intercept, correlation
   coefficient, and root mean square deviation from a linear regression of
   the calibrated power spectra were determined and compared among the
   groups.
   Results: Statistical analysis showed that significant differences were
   observable between groups for mean midband fit, intercept, and root mean
   square deviation (t test, P < .05). Discriminant analysis of these
   parameters was then performed to classify the data. For CP (n = 15)
   versus PC (n = 15), the same parameters provided 83\% accuracy and an
   area under the curve of 0.83.
   Limitations: Moderate sample size and spatial averaging inherent in the
   technique.
   Conclusions: This study shows that mean spectral parameters of the
   backscattered signals obtained by using electronic array echoendoscopes
   can provide a noninvasive method to quantitatively discriminate between
   CP and PC. (Gastrointest Endosc 2012;75:1175-83.)}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive engine to drive-cycle modelling framework has been
   developed for evaluating fuel economy improvements of new engine
   technologies. The framework comprises three key components: (a) full
   engine system models and routines for the generation of engine
   performance and fuel consumption maps; (b) an improved experimental heat
   release analysis and model calibration tool, which was created by
   coupling an in-house heat release analysis program to an engine cycle
   simulation, and which can be used for model calibration and validation
   when experimental data are available; and (c) an integrated vehicle
   modelling and drive-cycle simulation platform for fuel economy
   assessment. The framework implementation has been demonstrated through a
   fuel economy study of three engine and combustion technologies: a
   conventional spark-ignition (SI) engine, a high compression ratio SI
   engine with early intake valve closing (EIVC), and a homogeneous-charge
   compression ignition engine (HCCI) employing a recompression valve
   strategy, used in dual-mode SI-HCCI operation. Simulation results for
   three drive cycles indicate potential fuel economy gains of the order of
   7-11\% for the high-compression EIVC SI engine and 7-21\% for the
   dual-mode HCCI engine configurations. Further analysis of the latter,
   however, reveals frequent mode switching and short excursions in the
   HCCI region, which could be a challenge during practical implementation,
   and potentially result in reduced fuel economy gains.}},

Abstract = {{The resource service transaction in service-oriented manufacturing
   systems is one of the key issues in deciding its practical
   implementation and application. In order to enhance the benefit of the
   three sides or users (i.e. resource service provider, resource service

   service-oriented manufacturing systems, the comprehensive utility models
   consider the revenue, time, and reliability for the three sides in the
   resource service-transaction process faced with uncertain factors under
   decentralized decision-making conditions are established first. Then the
   related comprehensive utility model for the resource service transaction
   chain of `multiple resource service providers - one agent - multiple
   resource service demanders' under a centralized decision-making
   condition is proposed and discussed. The existence of utility
   equilibrium between resource service provider and agent is studied and
   proved. As is the optimal decision of a resource service transaction
   chain under the decentralized decision-making condition, as well as the
   utility equilibrium between agent and resource service demander. A
   utility coordination method is proposed, with the aim of improving the

Title = {{Vibration-induced errors in MEMS tuning fork gyroscopes}},
Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{32-44}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyzes potential causes of vibration-induced error in ideal
   MEMS tuning fork gyroscopes. Even though MEMS gyros are known to be
   highly susceptible to mechanical vibration, the mechanisms responsible
   for generating vibration-induced errors are not well understood. We
   focus on the tuning fork gyroscope (TFG) design that is known to be
   relatively immune to vibration because of its differential operation and
   common-mode rejection. Our analysis, however, demonstrates that even an
   ideal TFG cannot completely eliminate vibrations in special situations
   because of vibration-induced asymmetry and nonlinearity. We identify
   three major causes of error that arise from (1) capacitive nonlinearity
   at the sense electrode, (2) asymmetric electrostatic forces along sense
   direction at the drive electrodes, and (3) asymmetric electrostatic
   forces (i.e., drive-electrode capacitance) along drive direction at the
   drive electrodes. The occurrence conditions and characteristics of each
   cause are analyzed. The effects of the causes on three classes of TFG
   gyro designs are analyzed and compared both qualitatively and
   quantitatively using dynamic analysis and simulation. Interestingly, in
   our simulation conditions, one TFG design (denoted as Type-DD) is less
   sensitive to vibration (>99\% reduction) than the other two TFG designs
   (denoted as Type-CP and Type-DS). The reason for this difference is that
   Type-DD gyroscopes are immune to the dominant cause of error afflicting
   Type-CP and Type-DS designs. Our analysis also demonstrates that the
   most critical error-generation condition is vibration along with the
   sense direction of gyroscopes (denoted as sense-direction vibration)
   because of its contribution to all causes of error. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present the experimental generation of Bessel beams using a leaky
   radial waveguide. The radial waveguide consists of a capacitive sheet
   over a ground plane. The capacitive sheet is composed of patch elements
   printed on both sides of a dielectric substrate. The radial waveguide is
   coaxially fed and supports an azimuthally invariant leaky-wave mode
   whose normal electric-field component is a truncated, zeroth-order
   Bessel function. Two prototypes are presented with the same propagation
   constant and lateral extent, but different attenuation constants. 2D
   electric field measurements and their respective Fourier transforms
   validate the operation of the prototypes as Bessel-beam launchers at two
   frequency bands. Cleaner patterns are achieved by the prototype with
   lower attenuation constant. The dual-band capability and associated
   frequency dependent resolution can be useful in near-field planar
   focusing systems. The proposed structure can be used for generating
   arbitrary zeroth-order propagating Bessel beams at microwave and
   millimeter-wave frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Human behavior models give insight into people's choices and actions and

   Most models focus on a task's cognitive aspects or its physical
   requirements. This research addresses the divide between cognitive and

   cognitive-physical human model that enables studying of complex
   human-machine interactions. The capabilities of the integrated model are
   evaluated in a task scenario with both cognitive and physical
   components, i.e., driving while performing a secondary in-vehicle task.
   When applied in this way, the integrated model is called the Virtual
   Driver model and can replicate basic driving, in-vehicle tasks, and
   resource-sharing behaviors, providing a new way to study driver
   distraction. The model has applicability to interface design and

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic welding is a rapidly developing field. It is an industrial
   technique whereby high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations are
   locally applied to workpieces being pressed together to create a
   solid-state weld. A big advantage of ultrasonic welding is its
   efficiency of joining dissimilar thin metal sheets or foils used in
   battery, aerospace, and auto industry. The invention of more
   sophisticated and inexpensive equipment and increased demand have led to
   a growing knowledge of the fundamental process. However, many aspects of
   ultrasonic welding still require additional studies, such as better
   relating weld quality to process parameters. Inspecting the quality of
   the ultrasonic welding joints in-line also poses new challenges.
   Currently, destructive tensile test is one of the most effective ways to
   inspect the joint quality in laboratory, but it cannot be applied for
   in-line inspection. In this paper, the feasibility of using shearography
   technique for inspecting ultrasonic weld quality has been studied. A new
   shearography system with submillimeter resolution was designed, built,

   nondestructive testing (NDT) was performed. The experimental results

Abstract = {{Precipitate evolution in HCM12A following proton irradiations to 3, 7
   and 10 dpa at 400 degrees C, or following Fe++ irradiations to 100 and
   500 dpa at 500 degrees C was studied. Ni/Si/Mn-rich precipitates were
   irradiation-induced and their nucleation was closely related to the
   local enrichment of Ni, Si and Mn at sinks such as dislocations due to
   radiation induced segregation. The composition of Ni/Si/Mn-rich
   precipitates evolved with irradiation dose and was different from that
   of the G-phase reported in irradiated ferritic-martensitic alloys.
   Nucleation of Cu-rich precipitates saturated after 3 dpa at 400 degrees
   C and coarsened at higher dose. Irradiation enhanced the precipitation
   of Cu-rich precipitates at 400 degrees C but suppressed the nucleation
   at 500 degrees C. Partial dissolution of Cu-rich precipitates must have
   occurred at 500 dpa at 500 degrees C as the volume fraction was smaller
   at 500 dpa than that at 100 dpa. Cr-rich precipitates were irradiation
   enhanced and were observed under irradiation at 400 degrees C but not
   observed at 500 degrees C due to the increase in Cr solubility with
   temperature. The evolution of Cr-rich precipitates with irradiation dose
   was likely related to the complex redistribution of Cr among chromium
   carbides, grain boundaries and matrix under irradiation.
   Radiation-induced Cr-rich carbides were observed following Fe++
   irradiation to 500 dpa at 500 degrees C. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The Oregon State TRIGA Reactor (OSTR) was converted from highly enriched
   uranium (HEU) Fuel Life Improvement Program (FLIP) fuel to low-enriched
   uranium (LEU) fuel in October 2008. This effort was driven by the U.S.
   Department of Energy's Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactor
   program. The new LEU fuel is 30/20 U-Zr1.6H (30\% uranium in the fuel
   matrix, 19.75 wt\% enriched) in contrast to the FLIP fuel having
   U-Zr1.6H (8.5\% uranium in the fuel matrix, 70 wt\% enriched). This new
   fuel composition provides the best match in performance of the available
   mixture ratios when compared to the previous FLIP fuel. To support
   conversion, a complete assessment and reevaluation of the OSTR Safety
   Analysis Report was performed. This evaluation included steady-state
   thermal-hydraulic and neutronics characterizations of the HEU and LEU
   cores as well as a transient behavior (pulse) analysis of both core
   types.
   This paper presents a summary of the methods used and results produced
   during the pulse analysis identifying power, temperature, and reactivity
   during pulsed operation for the FLIP and new LEU fuel. This analysis was
   performed using RELAP5-3D version 2.4.2 and point reactor kinetics
   simulation software; these two methods are found to agree very well. We
   discuss the differences between the two fuels and the impact of pulse
   behavior on the safety limits for the converted reactor.}},

Title = {{Atmospheric pressure ionization waves propagating through a flexible
   high aspect ratio capillary channel and impinging upon a target}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Atmospheric pressure ionization waves (IWs) propagating in flexible
   capillary tubes are a unique way of transporting a plasma and its active
   species to remote sites for applications such as biomedical procedures,
   particularly in endoscopic procedures. The propagation mechanisms for
   such IWs in tubes having aspect ratios of hundreds to thousands are not
   clear. In this paper, results are discussed from a numerical
   investigation of the fundamental properties of ionization waves
   generated by nanosecond voltage pulses inside a 15 cm long, 600 mu m
   wide (aspect ratio 250), flexible dielectric channel. The channel,
   filled with a Ne/Xe = 99.9/0.1 gas mixture at 1 atm, empties into a
   small chamber separated from a target substrate by 1 cm. The IWs
   propagate through the entire length of the channel while maintaining
   similar strength and magnitude. Upon exiting the channel into the
   chamber, the IW induces a second streamer discharge at the
   channel-chamber junction. This streamer then propagates across the
   chamber and impinges upon the target. The average speeds of the
   capillary-bounded IW are about 5 x 10(7) cm s(-1) and 1 x 10(8) cm s(-1)
   for positive and negative polarities, respectively. The propagation
   speed is sensitive to the curvature of the channel. In both cases, the
   peak in ionization tends to be located along the channel walls and
   alternates from side-to-side depending on the direction of the local
   instantaneous electric field and curvature of the channel. The
   ionization region following the IW extends up to several centimeters
   inside the channel, as opposed to being highly localized at the
   ionization front in unconstrained, atmospheric pressure IWs. The maximum
   speed of the IW in the chamber is about twice that in the channel.}},

   nodes and 11 with malignant lymph nodes, as verified by fine-needle
   aspiration. Midband fit, slope, intercept, correlation coefficient, and
   root-mean-square (RMS) deviation from a linear regression of the
   calibrated power spectra were determined and compared between the
   groups. Significant differences were observable for mean midband fit,
   intercept, and RMS deviation (t test P<0.05). For benign (n=16) vs.
   malignant (n=12) lymph nodes, midband fit and RMS deviation provided
   classification with 89\% accuracy and area under receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.95 based on linear discriminant
   analysis. We concluded that the mean spectral parameters of the

Abstract = {{The brake and steering systems in vehicles are the most effective
   actuators that directly affect the vehicle dynamics. In general, the
   brake system affects the longitudinal dynamics and the steering system
   affects the lateral dynamics; however, their effects are coupled when
   the vehicle is braking on a non-homogenous surface, such as a split-mu
   road. The yaw moment compensation of the steering control on a split-mu
   road is one of the basic functions of integrated or coordinated chassis
   control systems and has been demonstrated by several chassis suppliers.
   However, the disturbance yaw moment is generally compensated for using
   the yaw rate feedback or using wheel brake pressure measurement. Access
   to the wheel brake pressure through physical sensors is not cost
   effective; therefore, we modeled the hydraulic brake system to avoid
   using physical sensors and to estimate the brake pressure. The steering
   angle controller was designed to mitigate the non-symmetric braking
   force effect and to stabilize the yaw rate dynamics of the vehicle. An
   H-infinity design synthesis was used to take the system model and the
   estimation errors into account, and the designed controller was
   evaluated using vehicle tests.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid Ni-P alloy plating coating containing nano-Al2O3 and
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles on the substrate of 45 steel
   has been prepared by an electroless plating method. The microstructure,
   microhardness, and wear resistance of the composite plating coating were
   analyzed using a microhardness tester, optical microscope, scanning
   electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and friction-wear tester. The
   results show that the Ni-P-PTFE-nano-Al2O3 composite plating coating
   with high wear resistance and a low friction coefficient, made by the
   combination of 3g/L nano-Al2O3 and 10 mL/L PTFE particles in plating
   solution, was responsible for enhancing tribological and lubricating
   properties on the 45 steel surface. The microhardness of the
   Ni-P-PTFE-nano-Al2O3 amorphous coating was HV452; its hardness was
   correspondingly increased and reached HV756 with a heat treatment at 350
   degrees C for 1 h, with the PTFE particles in the coating undestroyed.
   Simultaneously, the wear loss was 1.6 mg and the friction coefficient
   was 0.11, the cooperative effect of both particles enabled the
   Ni-P-PTFE-nano-Al2O3 composite coating to have highly wear-resistant and
   lubricating properties.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper compression-dependent bioimpedance measurements of porcine
   spleen tissue are presented. Using a Cole-Cole model, nonlinear
   compositional changes in extracellular and intracellular makeup; related
   to a loss of fluid from the tissue, are identified during compression.
   Bioimpedance measurements were made using a custom tetrapolar probe and
   bioimpedance circuitry. As the tissue is increasingly compressed up to
   50\%, both intracellular and extracellular resistances increase while
   bulk membrane capacitance decreases. Increasing compression to 80\%
   results in an increase in intracellular resistance and bulk membrane
   capacitance while extracellular resistance decreases. Tissues compressed
   incrementally to 80\% show a decreased extracellular resistance of 32\%,
   an increased intracellular resistance of 107\%, and an increased bulk
   membrane capacitance of 64\% compared to their uncompressed values.
   Intracellular resistance exhibits double asymptotic curves when plotted
   against the peak tissue pressure during compression, possibly indicating
   two distinct phases of mechanical change in the tissue during
   compression. Based on these findings, differing theories as to what is
   happening at a cellular level during high tissue compression are
   discussed, including the possibility of cell rupture and mass exudation
   of cellular material.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce the theoretical framework of laser wakefield acceleration
   and plasma wiggler radiation generation in the matched regime, give
   scaling laws and apply the scheme to laser systems planned for the near
   future. We compare the anticipated electron and x-ray beam parameters
   for a 100 TW, 1 PW and 10 PW short pulse Ti:Sapphire laser with previous
   experimental results. Depending on the chosen laser configuration,
   x-rays from a plasma wiggler beamline (PWB) can be several orders of
   magnitude brighter than current betatron sources, and comparable to or
   better than 3rd generation synchrotron facilities. Furthermore,
   increasing the laser power from 0.1 to 10 PW, the spectral peak of the
   betatron radiation shifts into the hard x-ray and gamma-ray regime. We
   also discuss a basic layout of a PWB and motivate 100 TW, 1 PW and 10 PW
   beamlines with a wide range of uses, experiments and applications. The
   ability to couple the PWBs with various optical laser drivers has the
   potential to facilitate uses across the spectrum of light source
   applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{HIGH ENERGY DENSITY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{161-169}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We use the recently developed Center for Radiative Shock Hydrodynamics
   (CRASH) code to numerically simulate laser-driven radiative shock
   experiments. These shocks are launched by an ablated beryllium disk and
   are driven down xenon-filled plastic tubes. The simulations are
   initialized by the two-dimensional version of the Lagrangian Hyades code
   which is used to evaluate the laser energy deposition during the first
   1.1 ns. Later times are calculated with the CRASH code. CRASH solves for
   the multi-material hydrodynamics with separate electron and ion
   temperatures on an Eulerian block-adaptive-mesh and includes a
   multi-group flux-limited radiation diffusion and electron thermal heat
   conduction. The goal of the present paper is to demonstrate the
   capability to simulate radiative shocks of essentially three-dimensional
   experimental configurations, such as circular and elliptical nozzles. We
   show that the compound shock structure of the primary and wall shock is
   captured and verify that the shock properties are consistent with
   order-of-magnitude estimates. The synthetic radiographs produced can be
   used for comparison with future nozzle experiments at
   high-energy-density laser facilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the radar retrieval of soil moisture as well as
   canopy parameters in a range of boreal forests. The retrieval is
   formulated as an optimization problem where the difference between data
   and prediction of a forward scattering model is minimized. The forward
   model is a discrete scatterer radar model, and the optimization
   algorithm is a global optimization scheme known as simulated annealing.
   The inversion method is first applied to synthetic data assuming
   hypothetical allometric relationships to make the retrieval possible by
   reducing the number of unknown vegetation parameters. The inversion
   algorithm is then validated using the data acquired with the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Jet Propulsion Laboratory
   (JPL) Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) in
   June 2010 in central Canada boreal forests in support of the prelaunch
   calibration and validation activities of NASA's Soil Moisture Active and
   Passive (SMAP) mission. The inversion results for synthetic data show
   that the absolute retrieval error in soil moisture and relative
   retrieval error in canopy height are small, while the relative output
   error in trunk density could be large. The inversion results for actual
   field data show a great accuracy in soil moisture retrieval for Old Jack
   Pine and Young Jack Pine forests but show large retrieval errors for
   many of the radar pixels in the Old Black Spruce site. This paper shows
   that L-band radar is capable of retrieving surface soil moisture in
   forests with a high biomass where the forest structure allows soil
   moisture information to be carried by scattering mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Radar imaging of deserts suffers from insufficient radar backscatter at
   low microwave frequencies due to the low permittivity of dry sand and
   relatively smooth sand surface roughness. Operating at millimeter-wave
   (MMW) frequencies, however, rectifies this deficiency as significant
   radar backscatter is generated by surface and volume scattering. This is
   due to the fact that sand surface roughness is electrically large and
   signal penetration into the dry sand, which is a homogeneous mixture of
   air and sand particles with dimensions comparable to a fraction of a
   wavelength, generates considerable volume scattering. This paper
   investigates both surface and volume scattering from dry sand surfaces,
   subject to the peculiar physical properties of sand surfaces found in
   sand dune-covered regions. An incoherent model is proposed that
   characterizes the angular dependence of volume scattering from dry sand
   in the presence of a 1-D rippled air/sand surface. A set of indoor
   experiments conducted on smooth and 1-D rippled sand surfaces at Ka-band
   confirms that significant volume scattering is present at MMW
   frequencies and that the proposed model correctly captures the observed
   angular dependence when 1-D surface ripples are present.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a 14-tap 8-bit finite impulse response (FIR)
   test-chip that has been designed using a novel charge-recovery logic
   family, called Enhanced Boost Logic (EBL), to achieve high-speed and
   low-power operation. Compared to previous charge-recovery circuitry, EBL
   achieves increased gate overdrive, resulting in low latency overhead
   over static CMOS design. The EBL-based FIR has been designed with only
   1.5 cycles of additional latency over its static CMOS counterpart, while
   consuming 21\% less energy per cycle, based on post-layout simulations
   of the two designs. The test-chip has been fabricated in a 0.13 mu m
   CMOS process with a fully-integrated 3 nH inductor. Correct function has
   been validated in the 365-600 MHz range. At its resonant frequency of
   466 MHz, the test-chip dissipates 39.1 mW with a 93.6
   nW/MHz/Tap/InBit/CoeffBit figure of merit, recovering 45\% of the energy
   supplied to it every cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Adhesives with functionally graded material properties are being
   considered for use in adhesively bonded joints to reduce the peel stress
   concentrations located near adherend discontinuities. Several practical
   concerns impede the actual use of such adhesives. These include
   increased manufacturing complications, alterations to the grading due to
   adhesive flow during manufacturing, and whether changing the loading
   conditions significantly impact the effectiveness of the grading. An
   analytical study is conducted to address these three concerns. An
   enhanced joint finite element, which uses an analytical formulation to
   obtain exact shape functions, is used to model the joint. Furthermore,
   proof-of-concept testing is conducted to show the potential advantages
   of functionally graded adhesives. In this study, grading is achieved by
   strategically placing glass beads within the adhesive layer at different
   densities along the joint. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Ag-based catalysts with different loadings on various
   oxide supports, including low-surface-area alpha-Al2O3, Al2O3 C,
   Al2O3,Acid, SiO2 90, TiO2 and SrTiO3 synthesized by a sol-gel process,
   were investigated for ethylene epoxidation over a range of reaction
   temperatures. The specific surface area, crystallinity, surface
   morphology, oxidation state, metal crystallite size, and oxygen and
   ethylene adsorption characteristics of all prepared catalysts were
   characterized and correlated to the ethylene epoxidation activity.
   Compared with conventional Ag catalysts supported on low-surface-area
   alpha-Al2O3, the 17.16 wt\% Ag/SrTiO3 catalyst exhibited much better
   catalytic activity for the ethylene epoxidation reaction, providing both
   the highest EO yield of 4.5\% and EO selectivity up to 99\%. The results
   indicate that high oxygen and ethylene uptakes, together with the large
   size of Ag particles, play an important role in achieving the best

   particles were produced in gram scale using a solution combustion method

Abstract = {{Recently acclaimed the fourth fundamental circuit element, the memristor
   was theoretically predicted by Leon Chua in 1971, although its single
   device electronic implementation eluded the attention of integrated
   circuit designers for the past three decades and was first reported in
   2008 by the Hewlett-Packard (HP) Laboratory researchers while developing
   crossbar-based ultra high-density nonvolatile memories. Memristor-based
   hybrid nanoscale CMOS technology is expected not only to impact the
   flash memory industries profoundly, but also to revolutionize digital
   and neuromorphic computing. The memristor exhibits a dynamical
   resistance state that depends on its excitation history and which can be
   exploited to build transistor-less nonvolatile semiconductor memory
   (NVSM), commonly known as resistive RAM (RRAM). This paper addresses an
   implementation scheme for memristor-based resistive random access memory
   (MRRAM), a nano-scale binary memory that is compatible with modern
   computer systems. Its structure is similar to that of static random
   access memory (SRAM), but with the memristor replacing the underlying RS
   flip-flop. By improving the MRRAM, we propose a multilevel memory with
   greater data density, which stores multiple bit information in
   gray-scale form in a memory unit. Reported computer simulations and
   numerical analyses verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in
   storing ASCII characters and gray-scale images in binary format.}},

Abstract = {{Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) may represent an ideal
   cell source for research and applications in regenerative medicine.
   However, standard culture conditions that depend on the use of undefined
   substrates and xenogeneic medium components represent a significant
   obstacle to clinical translation. Recently, we reported a defined
   culture system for human embryonic stem cells using a synthetic polymer
   coating, poly{[}2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl
   dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide] (PMEDSAH), in conjunction
   with xenogeneic-free culture medium. Here, we tested the hypothesis that
   iPSCs could be maintained in an undifferentiated state in this xeno-free
   culture system and subsequently be differentiated into mesenchymal stem
   cells (iPS-MSCs). hiPSCs were cultured on PMEDSAH and differentiated
   into functional MSCs, as confirmed by expression of characteristic MSC
   markers (CD166+, CD105+, CD90+,CD73+, CD31-, CD34-, and CD45-) and their
   ability to differentiate in vitro into adipogenic, chondrogenic, and
   osteoblastic lineages. To demonstrate the potential of iPS-MSCs to
   regenerate bone in vivo, the newly derived cells were induced to
   osteoblast differentiation for 4 days and transplanted into calvaria
   defects in immunocompromised mice for 8 weeks. MicroCT and histologic
   analyses demonstrated de novo bone formation in the calvaria defects for
   animals treated with iPS-MSCs but not for the control group. Moreover,
   positive staining for human nuclear antigen and human mitochondria
   monoclonal antibodies confirmed the participation of the transplanted
   hiPS-MSCs in the regenerated bone. These results demonstrate that hiPSCs
   cultured in a xeno-free system have the capability to differentiate into
   functional MSCs with the ability to form bone in vivo. STEM

Abstract = {{This work revisits the design of crossbar and high-radix interconnects
   in light of advances in circuit and layout techniques that improve
   crossbar scalability, obviating the need for deep multi-stage networks.
   We employ a new building block, the Swizzle-Switch-an energy-and
   area-efficient switching element that can readily scale to radix 64-that
   has recently been validated via silicon test chips in 45 nmtechnology.
   We evaluate the Swizzle-Switch as both the high-radix building block of
   a Flattened Butterfly and as a single-stage interconnect, the
   Swizzle-Switch Network. In the process we address the architectural and
   layout challenges associated with centralized crossbar systems. Compared
   to a conventional Mesh, the Flattened Butterfly provides a 15\%
   performance improvement with a 2.5 reduction in the standard deviation
   of on-chip access times. The Swizzle-Switch Network achieves further
   gains, providing a 21\% improvement in performance, a 3 reduction in
   on-chip access variability, a 33\% reduction in interconnect power, and
   a 25\% reduction in total system energy while only increasing chip area
   by 7\%. Finally, this paper details a 3-D integrated version of the
   Swizzle-Switch Network, showing up to a 30\% gain in performance over
   the 2-D Swizzle-Switch Network for benchmarks sensitive to interconnect
   latency. One major concern with 3-D designs is thermal dissipation. We
   show through detailed thermal analysis that with the highly
   energy-efficient Swizzle-Switch Network design that the thermal budget
   is well within that of passive cooling solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Microtubules are essential structures for cellular organization. They
   support neuronal processes and cilia, they are the scaffolds for the
   mitotic spindle, and they are the tracks for intracellular transport
   that actively organizes material and information within the cell. The
   mechanical properties of microtubules have been studied for almost 30
   years, yet the results from different groups are startlingly disparate,
   ranging over an order of magnitude. Here we present results
   demonstrating the effects of purification, associated-protein content,
   age, and fluorescent labeling on the measured persistence length using
   the freely fluctuating filament method. We find that small percentages
   (< 1\%) of residual microtubule-associated proteins left over in the
   preparation can cause the persistence length to double, and that these
   proteins also affect the persistence length over time. Interestingly, we
   find that the fraction of labeled tubulin dimers does not affect the
   measured persistence length. Further, we have enhanced the analysis
   method established by previous groups. We have added a bootstrapping
   with resampling analysis to estimate the error in the variance data used
   to determine the persistence length. Thus, we are able to perform a
   weighted fit to the data to more accurately determine the persistence
   length.}},

Abstract = {{The immense phase space of multimetallic materials spanned by structural
   and compositional degrees of freedom precludes thorough screening for
   efficient alloy catalysts, even with combinatorial high-throughput
   experiments or quantum-chemical calculations. Based on X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations, we
   have identified critical electronic structure descriptors that govern
   local chemical reactivity of different sites in metal alloys. These
   descriptors were used to develop a model that allows us to predict
   variations in the adsorption energy of various adsorbates on alloy
   surfaces based on easily accessible physical characteristics of the
   constituent elements in alloys, mainly their electronegativity, atomic
   radius, and the spatial extent of valence orbitals. We show that this
   model, which is grounded on validated theories of chemisorption on metal
   surfaces, can be used to rapidly screen through a large phase space of
   alloy catalysts and identify optimal alloys for targeted catalytic
   transformations. We underline the potential of the electronic structure
   engineering, relating alloy geometry to its catalytic performance using
   simple electronic structure descriptors, in catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Co-cultures of endothelial cells (EC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
   in three-dimensional (3D) protein hydrogels can be used to recapitulate
   aspects of vasculogenesis in vitro. MSC provide paracrine signals that
   stimulate EC to form vessel-like structures, which mature as the MSC
   transition to the role of mural cells. In this study, vessel-like
   network formation was studied using 3D collagen/fibrin (COL/FIB)
   matrices seeded with embedded EC and MSC and cultured for 7 days. The
   EC:MSC ratio was varied from 5:1, 3:2, 1:1, 2:3 and 1:5. The matrix
   composition was varied at COL/FIB compositions of 100/0 (pure COL),
   60/40, 50/50, 40/60 and 0/100 (pure FIB). Vasculogenesis was markedly
   decreased in the highest EC:MSC ratio, relative to the other cell
   ratios. Network formation increased with increasing fibrin content in
   composite materials, although the 40/60 COL/FIB and pure fibrin
   materials exhibited the same degree of vasculogenesis. EC and MSC were
   co-localized in vessel-like structures after 7 days and total cell
   number increased by approximately 70\%. Mechanical property measurements
   showed an inverse correlation between matrix stiffness and network
   formation. The effect of matrix stiffness was further investigated using
   gels made with varying total protein content and by crosslinking the
   matrix using the dialdehyde glyoxal. This systematic series of studies
   demonstrates that matrix composition regulates vasculogenesis in 3D
   protein hydrogels, and further suggests that this effect may be caused
   by matrix mechanical properties. These findings have relevance to the
   study of neovessel formation and the development of strategies to
   promote vascularization in transplanted tissues.}},

Abstract = {{A transient, one dimensional premixed laminar reaction front is used as
   a model problem to further understand the physical processes influencing
   reaction front propagation during the various stages of spark-assisted
   compression ignition (SACI) combustion for both constant and variable
   domain pressures. This approach is consistent with the wrinkled laminar
   flame representation of turbulent, spark ignited engine combustion. With
   the proper choice of timescales and pressure rise rate, it applies to
   the interaction of the flame with auto-igniting end-gas in a typical
   automotive engine. Under the conditions simulated by a transient flame
   code, the reaction front begins as a deflagration, propagating into an
   end-gas with an initially negligible level of reaction progress. The
   diffusive-reactive nature of the front is maintained until significant
   levels of end-gas reaction progress, where the burning velocity depends
   upon the degree of pre-reaction. At the time of the end-gas maximum
   chemical power, the maximum temperature gradient and peak rate of heat
   conduction within the front diminish to the point where combustion
   becomes chemically controlled. Although significant increases in burning
   velocity are observed at the onset of chemically controlled combustion
   within the front, the end-gas is within one front time from the
   completion of combustion. As a result, no more than one front thickness
   is consumed by the apparent propagation of the spontaneous ignition
   front. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Phase pure, nanostructured V, Mo and W nitrides and carbides were
   synthesized and characterized in aqueous KOH and H2SO4 electrolytes.
   Capacitances for most of the materials exceeded that expected for double
   layer charging and suggested a pseudocapacitive storage mechanism. With
   the exception of beta-Mo2C, the materials were stable in KOH and/or
   H2SO4 electrolytes. Capacitances for VN in KOH and gamma-Mo2N in H2SO4
   were the highest and exceeded 200 F g(-1). The charge-storage species
   were interrogated using an ion isolation method. The results provide
   unambiguous evidence that OH- was the principal charge storage species
   responsible for the pseudocapacitance demonstrated for VN in KOH while
   H+ was the principal species for gamma-Mo2N in H2SO4. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper models and analyzes the throughput of a two-stage
   manufacturing system with multiple independent unreliable machines at
   each stage and one finite-sized buffer between the stages. The machines
   follow exponential operation, failure, and repair processes. Most of the
   literature uses binary random variables to model unreliable machines in
   transfer lines and other production lines. This paper first illustrates
   the importance of using more than two states to model parallel
   unreliable machines because of their independent and asynchronous
   operations in the parallel system. The system balance equations are then
   formulated based on a set of new notations of vector manipulations, and
   are transformed into a matrix form fitting the properties of the
   Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process. The Matrix-Analytic (MA) method for
   solving the generic QBD processes is used to calculate the system state
   probability and throughput. Numerical cases demonstrate that solution
   method is fast and accurate in analyzing parallel manufacturing systems,
   and thus prove the applicability of the new model and the effectiveness
   of the MA-based method. Such multi-state models and their solution
   techniques can be used as a building block for analyzing larger, more
   complex manufacturing systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The transcription factor osterix (SP7) regulates BMP6-induced human

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{227}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The transcription factor Osterix (Sp7) is essential for
   osteoblastogenesis and bone formation in mice. Genome wide association
   studies have demonstrated that Osterix is associated with bone mineral
   density in humans; however, the molecular significance of Osterix in
   human osteoblast differentiation is poorly described. In this study we
   have characterized the role of Osterix in human mesenchymal progenitor
   cell (hMSC) differentiation. We first analyzed temporal microarray data
   of primary hMSC treated with bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP6) using
   clustering to identify genes that are associated with Osterix
   expression. Osterix clusters with a set of osteoblast-associated
   extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, including bone sialoprotein (BSP) and
   a novel set of proteoglycans, osteomodulin (OMD), osteoglycin, and
   asporin. Maximum expression of these genes is dependent upon both the
   concentration and duration of BMP6 exposure. Next we overexpressed and
   repressed Osterix in primary hMSC using retrovirus. The enforced
   expression of Osterix had relatively minor effects on osteoblastic gene
   expression independent of exogenous BMP6. However, in the presence of
   BMP6, Osterix overexpression enhanced expression of the aforementioned
   ECM genes. Additionally, Osterix overexpression enhanced BMP6 induced
   osteoblast mineralization, while inhibiting hMSC proliferation.
   Conversely, Osterix knockdown maintained hMSC in an immature state by
   decreasing expression of these ECM genes and decreasing mineralization
   and hMSC proliferation. Overexpression of the Osterix regulated gene OMD
   with retrovirus promoted mineralization of hMSC. These results suggest
   that Osterix is necessary, but not sufficient for hMSC osteoblast
   differentiation. Osterix regulates the expression of a set of ECM
   proteins which are involved in terminal osteoblast differentiation. J.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{An ecohydrological model Tethys-Chloris (T\&C) described in the
   companion paper is applied to two semiarid systems characterized by
   different climate and vegetation cover conditions. The Lucky Hills
   watershed in Arizona represents a typical small, ``unit-source''
   catchment of a desert shrub system of the U.S. southwest. Two nested
   basins of the Reynolds Creek Experimental watershed (Idaho, U.S.A.), the
   Reynolds Creek Mountain East and Tollgate catchments, are representative
   of a semiarid cold climate with seasonal snow cover. Both exhibit a
   highly non-uniform vegetation cover. A range of ecohydrological metrics
   of the long-term model performance is presented to highlight the model
   capabilities in reproducing hydrological and vegetation dynamics both at
   the plot and the watershed scales. A diverse set of observations is used
   to confirm the simulated dynamics. Highly satisfactory results are
   obtained without significant (or any) calibration efforts despite the
   large phase-space dimensionality of the model, the uncertainty of
   imposed boundary conditions, and limited data availability. It is argued
   that a significant investment into the model design based on the
   description of physical, biophysical, and ecological processes leads to
   such a consistent simulation skill. The simulated patterns mimic the
   outcome of hydrological and vegetation dynamics with high realism, as
   confirmed from spatially distributed remote sensing data. Further
   community efforts are warranted to address the issue of thorough
   quantitative assessment. The current lack of appropriate data hampers
   the development and testing of process-based ecohydrological models. It
   is further argued that the mechanistic nature of the T\&C model can be
   valuable for designing virtual experiments and developing questions of
   scientific inquiry at a range of spatiotemporal scales.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have explored the role of vegetation in controlling and
   mediating hydrological states and fluxes at the level of individual
   processes, which has led to improvements in our understanding of
   plot-scale dynamics. Relatively less effort has been directed toward
   spatially-explicit studies of vegetation-hydrology interactions at
   larger scales of a landscape. Only few continuous, process-oriented
   ecohydrological models had been proposed with structures of varying
   complexity. This study contributes to their further evolution and
   presents a novel ecohydrological model, Tethys-Chloris. The model
   synthesizes the state-of-the-art knowledge on individual processes and
   coupling mechanisms drawn from the disciplines of hydrology, plant
   physiology, and ecology. Specifically, the model reproduces all
   essential components of the hydrological cycle: it resolves the mass and
   energy budgets in the atmospheric surface layer at the hourly scale,
   while representing up to two layers of vegetation; it includes a module
   of snowpack evolution; it describes the saturated and unsaturated soil
   water dynamics, processes of runoff generation and flow routing. The
   component of vegetation dynamics parameterizes life cycle processes of
   different plant functional types, including photosynthesis, phenology,
   carbon allocation, and tissue turnover. This study presents a
   confirmation of the long-term, plot-scale model performance by
   simulating two types of ecosystems corresponding to different climate
   conditions. A consistent and highly satisfactory model skill in
   reproducing the energy and water budgets as well as physiological cycles
   of plants with minimum calibration overhead is demonstrated.
   Furthermore, these applications demonstrate that the model permits the
   identification of data types and observation frequencies crucial for
   appropriate evaluation of modeled dynamics. More importantly, through a
   synthesis of a wide array of process representations, the model ensures
   that climate, soil, vegetation, and topography collectively identify
   essential modes controlling ecohydrological systems, i.e., that
   satisfactory performance is a result of appropriate mimicking of
   internal processes.}},

   interaction data have been produced. Analyzing this data can provide
   substantial insight into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.
   However, the massive amount of sequence data presents daunting
   challenges. In our previous work, we have developed a novel algorithm
   called Hybrid Motif Sampler (HMS) that enables more scalable and
   accurate motif analysis. Despite much improvement, HMS is still
   time-consuming due to the requirement to calculate matching
   probabilities position-by-position. Using the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit, we
   developed a graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated motif analysis
   program named GPUmotif. We proposed a ``fragmentation'' technique to
   hide data transfer time between memories. Performance comparison studies
   showed that commonly-used model-based motif scan and de novo motif
   finding procedures such as HMS can be dramatically accelerated when
   running GPUmotif on NVIDIA graphics cards. As a result, energy
   consumption can also be greatly reduced when running motif analysis
   using GPUmotif. The GPUmotif program is freely available at
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/gpumotif/}},

Abstract = {{Fluoride ion catalyzed rearrangement of -{[}vinylSiO(1.5)](n)-oligomers
   and polymers in THF (tetrahydrofuran) provides essentially quantitative
   conversion to mixtures of the three dimensional (3-D) cage compounds
   {[}vinylSiO(1.5)](10) and {[}vinylSiO(1.5)](12) with small amounts of
   the {[}vinylSiO(1.5)](14) cage. These mixtures are easily transformed
   into their respective styrenyl analogs by metathesis with p-R-styrene to
   give 100\% conversion to the Generation 1 (GEN1) compounds
   {[}p-R-styrenyl-SiO1.5](10/12). The R = Br compounds are then easily
   modified by Heck coupling with p-R-styrene in >90\% yields and
   approximate to 100\% conversion to the Generation 2 (GEN2) compounds
   {[}p-R-stilbenevinylSiO(1.5)](10/12). These studies were designed to map
   structure-photophysical properties in these 3-D molecules with the goal
   of finding replacements for C-60 and C-70 electron acceptor compounds
   currently in use in most hybrid organic photovoltaics. Photophysical
   characterization indicates that the GEN2 compounds have average band
   gaps that are slightly smaller than their T-8 analogs. However, the C6F5
   derivative offers blue-shifted absorption with a very red-shifted
   emission in contrast to the blue emission shift that was expected
   coincident with the absorption blue shift. Initial cyclic voltammetry
   studies suggest that the GEN2 C6F5 derivative has HOMO-LUMO energies
   that may, through further modification, provide energy levels that meet
   our target objectives. In addition, solvent studies targeting absorption
   and emission behavior find emission behavior in poor solvents for R = H,
   Me, MeO that suggests some form of aggregation. This aggregation red
   shifts emission, perhaps arising from partial interdigitation of
   p-R-stilbenevinyl groups. Because these molecules are 3-D, moieties
   opposite the points of interdigitation emit as they do in good solvents,
   leading to emissions that broadened greatly. Furthermore, because we
   have previously observed what appears to be 3-D conjugation in the
   excited state, these results suggest the potential to promote charge
   transport in three dimensions perhaps similar to C-60/C-70. Alternately,
   these same materials may serve as novel emitters for light emitting
   diodes.}},

Abstract = {{We have experimentally investigated the dynamic polariton condensation
   behavior in a single GaN nanowire strongly coupled to a dielectric
   microcavity under nonresonant optical excitation. Both time-integrated
   and time-resolved polariton luminescence measurements have been made in
   the temperature range of 25 to 100 K (corresponding to exciton-cavity
   photon detuning of -3.0 to + 4.2 meV). Polariton lasing is observed in
   the entire temperature range, with the lowest threshold energy of 57
   nJ/cm(2) measured at 50 K (delta = -1.3 meV). All the measurements
   indicate that at the lower temperatures the degenerate polariton
   condensate is not in thermal equilibrium with the phonon bath. At 85 and
   100 K (delta = + 2.3 and 4.2 meV), the system attains a state close to
   thermal equilibrium via dynamic Bose condensation. The best results are
   obtained at T-latt = 85 K, for which T-LP = 88.8 K, and this is the
   highest temperature recorded for an equilibrium phase transition in
   exciton-polariton condensates.}},

Abstract = {{DC electric fields are used to produce colloidal assemblies with
   orientational and layered positional order from a dilute suspension of
   spheroidal particles. These 3D assemblies, which can be visualized in
   situ by confocal microscopy, are achieved in short time spans (t < 1 h)
   by the application of a constant voltage across the capacitor-like
   device. This method yields denser and more ordered assemblies than had
   been previously reported with other assembly methods. Structures with a
   high degree of orientational order as well as layered positional order
   normal to the electrode surface are observed. These colloidal structures
   are explained as a consequence of electrophoretic deposition and
   field-assisted assembly. The interplay between the deposition rate and
   the rotational Brownian motion is found to be critical for the optimal
   ordering, which occurs when these rates, as quantified by the Peclet
   number, are of order one. The results suggest that the mechanism leading
   to ordering is equilibrium self-assembly but with kinetics dramatically
   accelerated by the application of the DC electric field. Finally, the
   crystalline symmetry of the densest structure formed is determined and
   compared with previously studied spheroidal assemblies.}},

   output power. The output spectrum extends from 750-4300 nm, and it is
   generated by nonlinear spectral broadening in a 9 m long fluoride fiber
   pumped by high peak power pulses from a dual-stage erbium-ytterbium
   fiber amplifier operating at 1543 nm. The samples are distinguished
   using unique spectral signatures that are attributed to the molecular

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) shape reconstructions and metrology measurements
   are often limited by depth-of-field constraints. Current
   focus-detection-based techniques are insufficient to profile
   out-of-focus 3D objects with high axial accuracy. Extended-focus imaging
   (EFI) techniques can improve the range and precision of such
   measurements. By incorporating digital refocusing with multiwavelength
   interferometry, a holographic imaging solution is presented in this
   paper to accurately measure 3D objects over a large depth range.
   Accuracy and repeatability of the proposed EFI technique are validated
   by digital simulations and refocusing experiments. A reconstruction
   example demonstrates the feasibility of high-precision 3D measurements
   of objects deeper than the system's classical depth of field. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Research on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has attracted much
   attention given their great potential for tissue regenerative therapy
   and fundamental developmental biology studies. Yet, there is still
   limited understanding of how mechanical signals in the local cellular
   microenvironment of hESCs regulate their fate decisions. Here, we
   applied a microfabricated micromechanical platform to investigate the
   mechanoresponsive behaviors of hESCs. We demonstrated that hESCs are
   mechanosensitive, and they could increase their cytoskeleton
   contractility with matrix rigidity. Furthermore, rigid substrates
   supported maintenance of pluripotency of hESCs. Matrix
   mechanics-mediated cytoskeleton contractility might be functionally
   correlated with E-cadherin expressions in cell-cell contacts and thus
   involved in fate decisions of hESCs. Our results highlighted the
   important functional link between matrix rigidity, cellular mechanics,
   and pluripotency of hESCs and provided a novel approach to characterize
   and understand mechanotransduction and its involvement in hESC function.}},

Abstract = {{Proprioceptive and motor information contribute to movement
   representation; however, the equivalence of homologous contralateral
   sensorimotor processes as a function of gender and handedness has
   received little attention. The present work investigated asymmetry in
   contralateral reproductions of movements elicited by tendon vibration in
   right and left handed young adults of both genders. With eyes closed,
   illusions of elbow flexion movement elicited by a 100 Hz vibration
   applied to the distal tendon of the right or left triceps muscle were
   matched concurrently with the opposite limb. Overall, movement velocity
   was larger for females than males, asymmetric and handedness dependent
   in males. Conversely, consistent symmetry was found between left and
   right-handed females. These findings lead us to suggest that hand
   preference and gender contribute to differences in movement
   representation that may result from the combination of cortical
   structural differences and information processing specific to each
   hemisphere and gender. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Stratification and nutrient loading are two primary factors leading to
   hypoxia in coastal systems. However, where these factors are temporally
   correlated, it can be difficult to isolate and quantify their individual
   impacts. This study provides a novel solution to this problem by
   determining the effect of stratification based on its spatial
   relationship with bottom-water dissolved oxygen (BWDO) concentration
   using a geostatistical regression. Ten years (1998-2007) of midsummer
   Gulf of Mexico BWDO measurements are modeled using stratification
   metrics along with trends based on spatial coordinates and bathymetry,
   which together explain 27-61\% of the spatial variability in BWDO for
   individual years. Because stratification effects explain only a portion
   of the year-to-year variability in mean BWDO; the remaining variability
   is explained by other factors, with May nitrate plus nitrite river
   concentration the most important. Overall, 82\% of the year-to-year
   variability in mean BWDO is explained. The results suggest that while
   both stratification and nutrients play important roles in determining
   the annual extent of midsummer hypoxia, reducing nutrient inputs alone
   will substantially reduce the average extent.}},

Title = {{Life Cycle Comparison of Environmental Emissions from Three Disposal

Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{5535-5541}},

Abstract = {{We use life cycle assessment methodology to compare three disposal
   options for unused pharmaceuticals: (i) incineration after take-back to
   a pharmacy, (ii) wastewater treatment after toilet disposal, and (iii)
   landfilling or incineration after trash disposal. For each option,
   emissions of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the environment (API
   emissions) are estimated along with nine other types of emissions to air
   and water (non-API emissions). Under a scenario with 50\% take-back to a
   pharmacy and 50\% trash disposal, current API emissions are expected to
   be reduced by 93\%. This is within 6\% of a 100\% trash disposal
   scenario, which achieves an 88\% reduction. The 50\% take-back scenario
   achieves a modest reduction in API emissions over a 100\% trash scenario
   while increasing most non-API emissions by over 300\%. If the 50\% of
   unused pharmaceuticals not taken-back are toileted instead of trashed,
   all emissions increase relative to 100\% trash disposal. Evidence
   suggests that 50\% participation in take-back programs could be an upper
   bound. As a result, we recommend trash disposal for unused
   pharmaceuticals. A 100\% trash disposal program would have similar API
   emissions to a take-back program with 50\% participation, while also
   having significantly lower non-API emissions, lower financial costs,
   higher convenience, and higher compliance rates.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Statin is a specific inhibitor of
   3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a
   rate-limiting enzyme involved in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. In
   addition to their long-known efficacy for lowering cholesterol, statins
   have also been reported to possess anabolic effects on bone. Simvastatin
   is reported to increase cancellous bone volume, bone formation rate, and
   cancellous bone compressive strength in vivo.
   Materials and Methods. In this report, the effects of simvastatin on
   osteoprecursor cells were evaluated. The effect on cell viability was
   determined by MTT assay, whereas differentiation and mineralization were
   examined using an alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) test and alizarin
   red-S staining. Protein expressions related to bone formation, such as
   estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) and beta (ER-beta), were evaluated by
   using a Western blot analysis. To assess whether the osteoinductive
   effect of simvastatin occurs via estrogen receptor pathway, estrogen
   receptor agonist (E2) and antagonists (ICI 182,780) were applied to the
   cultures.
   Results. Cultures grown in the presence of simvastatin exhibited an
   increased value for ALP activity and mineralization. The results of the
   Western blot analysis indicated that the addition of simvastatin
   up-regulated ER-alpha and ER-beta expression with a statistically
   significant difference in ER-alpha expression. Treatment of E2 led to an
   increase of the ALP activity and mineralization, but addition of the
   estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 revealed a decrease in both
   values.
   Conclusions. Based on these findings, it was concluded that simvastatin
   could produce positive effects on both the differentiation and
   mineralization of osteoprecursor cells. Our results also suggested that
   osteoinductive effects of simvastatin were achieved through ER pathway
   via the increase of ER-alpha expression. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The effect of surface roughness on the morphological evolution of
   polycrystalline tungsten during bombardment by focused ion beam has been
   investigated. The nanoneedles were self-assembled on the mechanically
   polished tungsten surface with high roughness (Rz = 8.9 nm). In
   contrast, a specific surface without nanoneedles was formed on the
   electrochemically polished tungsten surface with low roughness (Rz = 1.4
   nm) although all bombardment parameters except for surface roughness
   were the same. The concave-convex surface morphology significantly
   influences nanoneedle formation due to its effect on the dynamic
   competition between the roughening and smoothing process. This discovery
   shows the importance of original surface roughness in controlling the
   morphological evolution of tungsten during ion irradiation and suggests
   a means for fabricating tungsten nanoneedles that might be used in
   quantum, photon and electron devices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An N-heterocyclic carbene-ligated palladium catalyst was discovered to
   mediate living, chain-growth polymerizations of both phenylene- and
   thiophene-based monomers. Polymerization of a fluorene-based monomer, on
   the other hand, did not proceed through a living, chain-growth pathway.
   Excitingly, block copolymerizations of phenylene and thiophene proceeded
   via a chain-growth pathway, regardless of the order of monomer addition.
   Although some chain termination was observed during these
   copolymerizations, this pathway could be minimized when the second
   monomer was added shortly after consumption of the first monomer. These
   results suggest that the catalyst resting-state at the end of
   polymerization is unstable. As a result, modifications to the
   NHC-scaffold or the 3-chloropyridine ligand will be necessary to
   generate an improved catalyst.}},

Title = {{High-Frequency, Low-Magnitude Vibration Does Not Prevent Bone Loss
   Resulting from Muscle Disuse in Mice following Botulinum Toxin Injection}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{High-frequency, low-magnitude vibration enhances bone formation
   ostensibly by mimicking normal postural muscle activity. We tested this
   hypothesis by examining whether daily exposure to low-magnitude
   vibration (VIB) would maintain bone in a muscle disuse model with
   botulinum toxin type A (BTX). Female 16-18 wk old BALB/c mice (N = 36)
   were assigned to BTX-VIB, BTX-SHAM, VIB, or SHAM. BTX mice were injected
   with BTX (20 mu L; 1 U/100 g body mass) into the left hindlimb posterior
   musculature. All mice were anaesthetized for 20 min/d, 5 d/wk, for 3 wk,
   and the left leg mounted to a holder. Through the holder, VIB mice
   received 45 Hz, =0.6 g sinusoidal acceleration without weight bearing.
   SHAM mice received no vibration. At baseline and 3 wk, muscle
   cross-sectional area (MCSA) and tibial bone properties (epiphysis,
   metaphysis and diaphysis) were assessed by in vivo micro-CT. Bone volume
   fraction in the metaphysis decreased 12 +/- 9\% and 7 +/- 6\% in BTX-VIB
   and BTX-SHAM, but increased in the VIB and SHAM. There were no
   differences in dynamic histomorphometry outcomes between BTX-VIB and BTX
   nor between VIB and SHAM. Thus, vibration did not prevent bone loss
   induced by a rapid decline in muscle activity nor produce an anabolic
   effect in normal mice. The daily loading duration was shorter than would
   be expected from postural muscle activity, and may have been
   insufficient to prevent bone loss. Based on the approach used in this
   study, vibration does not prevent bone loss in the absence of muscle
   activity induced by BTX.}},

   diagram at 300 K contains three first-order phase transformations

Abstract = {{We study the formation and organization of micelles, of
   polystyrene-b-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) diblock copolymer
   chains, in thin film hosts composed of (1) blends of long and short
   chain polystyrenes, PSL and PSS, of degrees of polymerization P-L and
   P-S, respectively (P-S < P-L), and (2) blends of PSL and a homopolymer
   with which it is compatible, tetramethyl bisphenol-A polycarbonate
   (TMPC), of degree of polymerization P-TMPC (P-TMPC < P-L). The role of
   competing entropic and enthalpic interactions on the block copolymer
   micelle formation and organization is examined. We show that the average
   size of the micelle cores, D-core, decreased with increasing weight
   fraction of the shorter chain PS component in PS(P-S = 125)/PS(P-L =
   15400) mixtures, for P-L>>N-PS, N-PS is the degree of polymerization of
   the PS block (the micelle corona). D-core also decreased with increasing
   weight fraction of TMPC in TMPC(P-TMPC = 122)/PS(P-L = 15400) mixtures.
   The values of D-core in the TMPC/PSL hosts were smaller than those in
   PSS/PSL mixtures, for the same TMPC, or PS, weight fractions (P-S
   approximate to P-TMPC). This is due to more extensive mixing between the
   TMPC host chains, compared to the PSS chains, and the micelle corona.
   Furthermore, we show that the size and the organization of the micelles
   within the films may be controlled independently, through changing the
   relative fractions of PSS or TMPC and the value of P-L. The fraction of
   TMPC, or PS, mixed with the corona decreased as P-L decreased from P-L =
   15400 to smaller values.}},

Abstract = {{Equilibrium adsorption of thiophenic sulfur compounds, thiophene (T),
   benzothiophene (BT), and dibenzothiophene (DBT), from their binary
   solutions in n-octane and ternary solutions in n-octane and benzene, on
   three sorbents (activated carbon (AC), AgNO3/MCM-41 and Cu(I)-Y) were
   studied systematically. Fixed-bed adsorption/breakthrough experiments on
   these sorbents were also carried out. For all thiophenic sulfur
   compounds in both binary and ternary solutions, the sorbent adsorption
   capacities followed the order: Cu(I)-Y > AgNO3/MCM-41 > AC. For each
   sorbent, the selectivity of adsorption of thiophenic sulfur compounds
   from liquid solutions followed the order: DBT > BT > T > benzene. The
   experimental results were well interpreted by molecular orbital
   calculation results. For ternary solutions, benzene competed against
   thiophenic sulfur compounds for adsorption sites, resulting in reduced
   thiophenic sulfur adsorption on the studied sorbents. Based on the
   single-solute Langmuir-Freundlich isotherms, the extended
   Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm (for multi-component equilibrium
   adsorption) was used to predict adsorption in ternary solutions, which
   was in fair agreement with the experimental results. The Cu(I)-Y sorbent
   was fully regenerable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Capping protein (CP) controls the polymerization of actin filaments by
   capping their barbed ends. In lamellipodia, CP dissociates from the
   actin cytoskeleton rapidly, suggesting the possible existence of an
   uncapping factor, for which the protein CARMIL (capping protein, Arp2/3
   and myosin-I linker) is a candidate. CARMIL binds to CP via two motifs.
   One, the CP interaction (CPI) motif, is found in a number of unrelated
   proteins; the other motif is unique to CARMILs, the CARMIL-specific
   interaction motif. A 115-aa CARMIL fragment of CARMIL with both motifs,
   termed the CP-binding region (CBR), binds to CP with high affinity,
   inhibits capping, and causes uncapping. We wanted to understand the
   structural basis for this function. We used a collection of mutants
   affecting the actin-binding surface of CP to test the possibility of a
   steric-blocking model, which remained open because a region of CBR was
   not resolved in the CBR/CP co-crystal structure. The CP actin-binding
   mutants bound CBR normally. In addition, a CBR mutant with all residues
   of the unresolved region changed showed nearly normal binding to CP.
   Having ruled out a steric-blocking model, we tested an allosteric model
   with molecular dynamics. We found that CBR binding induces changes in
   the conformation of the actin-binding surface of CP. In addition,
   similar to 30-aa truncations on the actin-binding surface of CP
   decreased the affinity of CBR for CP. Thus, CARMIL promotes uncapping by
   binding to a freely accessible site on CP bound to a filament barbed end
   and inducing a change in the conformation of the actin-binding surface
   of CP.}},

Abstract = {{While the high sensitivity of plasmonic metal nanoparticles in
   Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is well established,
   applications of SERS in the selective identification of trace quantities
   of targeted molecules in a mixture of species remain to be a challenge.
   In this contribution, we demonstrate the design of plasmonic substrates
   that selectively enhance specific Raman vibrational bands, thereby
   offering high molecular sensitivity. We show that by changing the
   density and shape of plasmonic Ag nanostructures in Ag aggregates we can
   selectively control their optical properties and the degree to which
   they enhance different vibrational bands. By correlating the optical
   extinction spectra of substrates and the enhancement factors for
   different Raman vibrational bands, we demonstrate that the observed
   difference in the enhancement of vibrational modes is due to the
   difference in the localized surface plasmon resonance intensity at the
   Stokes Raman shifted wavelengths. We also shed light on critical design
   parameters for the synthesis of plasmonic nanosubstrates for selective
   detection of a molecule in a mixture of compounds.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of sensor deployment to achieve k-coverage of a field, where
   every point is covered by at least k sensors, is very critical in the
   design of energy-efficient wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It becomes
   more challenging in mission-oriented WSNs, where sensors have to move in
   order to k-cover a region of interest in the field. In this type of
   network, there are multiple missions (or monitoring tasks) to be
   accomplished, each of which has different requirements, particularly, in
   terms of coverage. In this paper, we consider the problem of k-coverage
   in mission-oriented mobile WSNs which we divide into two sub-problems,
   namely sensor placement and sensor selection. The sensor placement
   problem is to identify a subset of sensors and their locations in a
   region of interest so it is k-covered with a small number of sensors.
   The sensor selection problem is to determine which sensors should move
   to the above-computed locations in the region while minimizing the total
   energy consumption due to sensor mobility and communication.
   Specifically, we propose centralized and distributed approaches to solve
   the k-coverage problem in mission-oriented mobile WSNs. Our solution to
   the sensor placement problem is based on Helly's Theorem and the
   geometric analysis of the Reuleaux triangle. First, we consider a
   deterministic (or disk) sensing model, where the sensing range is
   modeled as a disk Then, based on the above analysis, we address the
   k-coverage problem using a more realistic sensing model, known as
   probabilistic sensing model. The latter reflects the stochastic nature
   of the characteristics of the sensors, namely sensing and communication
   ranges. Our centralized and distributed protocols enable the sensors to
   move toward a region of interest and k-cover it with a small number of
   sensors. Our experiments show a good match between simulation and
   analytical results. In particular, simulation results show that our
   solution to the k-coverage problem in mission-oriented mobile WSNs
   outperforms an existing one in terms of the number of sensors needed to
   k-cover a region of interest in the field and their total energy
   consumption due to communication, sensing, and mobility for the correct
   operation of the protocol. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the behavior of phytol, an acyclic diterpene C-20-alcohol
   and a model compound for algal biomass, in high-temperature water (HTW)
   at 513K. 543 K. 573 K. and 623K. Under these conditions, the major
   products include neophytadiene, isophytol, and phytone. The minor
   products include pristene, phytene, phytane, and dihydrophytol.
   Neophytadiene likely forms via dehydration of phytol, while isophytol
   can be obtained via an allylic rearrangement. We have quantified the
   molar yields of each product at the four temperatures, and the carbon
   recovery was greater than 90\% for most cases. Phytol disappearance
   follows first order kinetics with an activation energy of 145 +/- 20
   kJ/mol and pre-exponential factor of 10(9.94 +/- 0.12) s(-1). Delplot
   analysis discriminated between primary and non-primary products and led
   to a potential set of reaction pathways. A kinetics model based on the
   proposed pathways was consistent with the experimental data. (C) 2012

Title = {{Energetic cost of walking with increased step variability}},

Abstract = {{Step-by-step variations occur during normal human walking, induced in
   part by imperfect sensorimotor control and naturally occurring random
   perturbations. These effects might increase energy expenditure during
   walking, because they differ from the nominal preferred gait, which is
   typically the most economical, and because of the cost of making active
   feedback adjustments to maintain gait stability. We tested this
   hypothesis by artificially inducing greater step variability through
   visual perturbations from a virtual reality display, and measuring the
   effect on energy expenditure. Young healthy adult subjects (N = 11)
   walked on a treadmill while viewing a virtual hallway, to which virtual
   perturbations were applied in fore-aft or medio-lateral directions. The
   greatest effect on gait was achieved with medio-lateral visual
   perturbations, which resulted in a 65\% increase in step width
   variability and a 5.9\% increase (both P < 0.05) in net metabolic rate
   compared to walking without perturbations. Perturbations generally
   induced greater variability in both step width and (to a lesser degree)
   step length, and also induced slightly wider and (to a lesser degree)
   shorter mean steps. Each of these measures was found to correlate
   significantly with each other, regardless of perturbation direction and
   magnitude. They also correlated with metabolic rate (P < 0.05 for each
   separate measure), despite explaining only a modest proportion of
   overall energetic variations (R-2 < 0.40). Step variability increases
   with some gait disorders and with increasing age. Our results suggest
   that imperfect sensorimotor control may contribute to the increased
   metabolic cost of walking observed with such conditions. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Ankle function is frequently measured using static or dynamic tasks in
   normal and injured patients. The purpose of this study was to develop a
   novel task to quantify ankle dynamics and muscle activity in normal

   Video motion analysis cameras, force platforms, and an EMG system were
   used to collect data during a lateral hop movement task that consisted
   of multiple lateral-medial hops over an obstacle. Mean (SD) inversion
   ankle position at contact was 4.4 degrees (4.0) in the medial direction
   and -3.5 degrees (4.4) in the lateral direction; mean (SD) tibialis
   anterior normalized muscle activity was 0.11 (0.08) in the medial
   direction and 0.16 (0.13) in the lateral direction. The lateral hop
   movement was shown to be an effective task for quantifying ankle
   kinematics, forces, moments, and muscle activities in normal subjects.
   Future applications will use the lateral hop movement to assess subjects

Abstract = {{Optical antennas working at 10.6 mu m with different dipole geometries

   wavelength of 10.6 mu m are studied with finite-difference-time-domain
   (FDTD) based calculation. Strong electric field (E-field) intensity
   distribution can be observed in the gap regions. Sharp angle effects are
   observed from the E-field distribution and it supports the strongest
   E-field distribution and the highest enhancement efficiency of the
   bow-tie infrared antenna. The dipole antenna with width of 100 nm is
   found to be the optimal geometry through exploring the relation between
   the width of dipole antenna and the antenna resolution. The high gain

Abstract = {{Hollow needles are commonly used in many areas of medicine, yet there
   has been limited research on needle tip geometry. A better understanding
   of needle tip geometry can lead to the creation of an optimized needle
   tip geometry design which would greatly benefit the procedure of biopsy,
   where a needle is used to cut and remove tissue from the body. The
   present research develops mathematical models to calculate the
   inclination and rake angle along the cutting edges of needle tips
   generated by curved surfaces. The parameters of needle insertion length
   and inner needle tip surface area are also examined. Needle insertion
   force is predicted based on needle geometry and calculated for curved
   and flat plane tip needles. A concave needle produced lower cutting
   forces than the convex and bias bevel needles. It is found that
   utilizing curved surface needle tip geometry, as opposed to flat plane
   geometry, allows for greater control in varying rake and inclination
   angles on the needle. This greater flexibility allows for more control
   in designing an optimized needle tip.}},

Abstract = {{Decentralized data processing has the benefit of improving wireless
   monitoring system scalability, reducing the amount of wireless
   communications, and reducing overall power consumption. In this study, a
   system identification strategy for single-input multi-output (SIMO)
   subspace system identification is proposed based on Markov parameters.
   The method is specifically customized for embedment within the
   decentralized computational framework of a wireless sensor network. By
   using the computational resources of wireless sensors, individual sensor
   nodes perform local data processing to identify the Markov parameters of
   a structural system. The data storage and wireless communication
   requirements of Markov parameters are significantly less than that
   required by the original raw data, resulting in the preservation of
   scarce system resources such as communication bandwidth and battery
   power. Then, the estimated Markov parameters are wirelessly communicated
   to a wireless sensor network base station where the global structural
   properties are assembled by execution of the eigensystem realization
   algorithm, an indirect subspace system identification method. The
   proposed strategy is evaluated using input-output and output-only data
   recorded during dynamic testing of a cantilevered balcony in a historic

Title = {{Hydroelastic response and energy harvesting potential of flexible
   piezoelectric beams in viscous flow}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Electroactive polymers such as piezoelectric elements are able to
   generate electric potential differences from induced mechanical
   deformations. They can be used to build devices to harvest ambient
   energy from natural flow-induced deformations, e. g., as flapping flags
   subject to flowing wind or artificial seaweed subject to waves or
   underwater currents. The objectives of this study are to (1) investigate
   the transient hydroelastic response and energy harvesting potential of
   flexible piezoelectric beams fluttering in incompressible, viscous flow,
   and (2) identify critical non-dimensional parameters that govern the
   response of piezoelectric beams fluttering in viscous flow. The
   fluid-structure interaction response is simulated using an immersed
   boundary approach coupled with a finite volume solver for
   incompressible, viscous flow. The effects of large beam deformation,
   membrane tension, and coupled electromechanical responses are all
   considered. Validation studies are shown for the motion of a flexible
   filament in uniform flow, and for a piezoelectric beam subject to base
   vibration. The predicted flutter velocities and frequencies also
   compared well with published experimental and numerical data over a
   range of Reynolds numbers for varying fluid and solid combinations. The
   results showed that for a heavy beam in a light fluid (i.e., high
   beta(rho) regime), flutter incepts at a lower critical speed with a
   lower reduced frequency than for a light beam in a heavy fluid (i.e.,
   low beta(rho) regime). In the high beta(rho) regime, flutter develops at
   the second mode and is only realized when the fluid inertial forces are
   in balance with the solid elastic restoring forces, which leads to large
   amplitude oscillations and complex wake patterns; the flutter speed is
   practically independent of the Reynolds number (Re) and solid to
   fluidmass ratio (beta(rho)), because the response is dominated by the
   solid inertial forces. In the low beta(rho) regime, fluid inertial
   forces dominate, flutter develops at higher modes and is only realized
   when the solid inertial forces are proportioned to the solid elastic
   restoring forces; the flutter speed depends on both Re and beta(rho),
   and viscous force and beam tension effects tend to delay flutter and
   reduce vibration amplitudes, leading to thinner, more simplified wake
   patterns. The results demonstrate that energy extraction via fluttering
   piezoelectric beams is possible. The overall efficiency was observed to
   be influenced by the piezoelectric circuit resistance, which is known to
   be directly related to the square of the piezoelectric coupling factor.
   The results show that the maximum strain limit of piezoelectrics may be
   exceeded, and hence careful optimization of the material and geometry is
   recommended to maximize the energy capture for a given range of expected
   flow conditions while satisfying safety and reliability requirements.

Title = {{Mixing properties of coaxial jets with large velocity ratios and large
   inverse density ratios}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to better understand the mixing
   properties of coaxial jets as several parameters were systematically
   varied, including the velocity ratio, density ratio, and the Reynolds
   number. Diameters of the inner and outer jet were also varied. Coaxial
   jets are commonly used to mix fluids due to the simplicity of their
   geometry and the rapid mixing that they provide. A measure of the
   overall mixing efficiency is the stoichiometric mixing length (L-s),
   which is the distance along the jet centerline where the two fluids have
   mixed to some desired concentration, which was selected to be the
   stoichiometric concentration for H-2/O-2 and CH4/O-2 in this case. For
   56 cases, the profiles of mean mixture fraction, rms mixture fraction
   fluctuations (unmixedness), and L-s were measured using acetone planar
   laser induced fluorescence diagnostics. Results were compared to three
   mixing models. The entrainment model of Villermaux and Rehab showed good
   agreement with the data, indicating that the proper non-dimensional
   scaling parameter is the momentum flux ratio M. The work extends the
   existing database of coaxial jet scalar mixing properties because it
   considers the specific regime of large values of both the velocity ratio
   and the inverse density ratio, which is the regime in which rocket
   injectors operate. Also the work focuses on the mixing up to L-s where
   previous work focused on the mixing up to the end of the inner core. The
   Reynolds numbers achieved for a number of cases were considerably larger
   than previous gas mixing studies, which insures that the jet exit
   boundary conditions are fully turbulent. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{The effects of energetic Ga ion bombardment on the surface morphology of
   mechanically polished polycrystalline tungsten are investigated by
   focused Ga+ ion beam irradiation with in situ scanning electron
   microscopy, as well as ex situ atomic force microscopy. The amount of
   removed material from the tungsten surface increased with increasing of
   incident ion angle, and also increased with ion energy from 5 to 30 keV
   while keeping all other bombardment parameters constant. The
   nanoneedle-shaped morphology formed by self-assembly in the surface of
   tungsten under off-normal angle bombardment, the larger the incident
   angle, the easier for the needle formation. In contrast, only a net-like
   microstructure formed under normal incident angle. Moreover, more Ga+
   ion fluence was needed to form pores at normal incident angle comparing
   to that under 52 degrees incident angle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Several classes of nozzles have been proposed in which the exhaust plume
   is not entirely bounded by the nozzle wall, and as a result, one
   boundary of the exhaust flow is in contact with the external airflow.
   These nozzles have the advantage that the shape of the exhaust plume
   automatically adjusts to varying flight conditions. However, this
   interaction between operating condition and plume shape complicates the
   analysis of such nozzles, compared with traditional bell nozzles. A
   method that is based on Riemann interactions is proposed for the
   analysis of two such nozzle geometries. The method assumes
   two-dimensional geometries and supersonic flow. Unlike the method of
   characteristics, this method accounts explicitly for the presence of
   oblique shocks and curved shear layers. Comparisons with both experiment
   and computational fluid dynamics are shown. The solution method requires
   no grid generation and typically runs in less than a minute on a single
   desktop computer, which is ideal for conceptual design, control design,
   or control evaluation studies. It includes high-temperature gas modeling
   and finite-rate chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{DNA looping mediated by the Lac repressor is an archetypal test case for
   modeling protein and DNA flexibility. Understanding looping is
   fundamental to quantitative descriptions of gene expression. Systematic
   analysis of LacI center dot DNA looping was carried out using a
   landscape of DNA constructs with lac operators bracketing an A-tract
   bend, produced by varying helical phasings between operators and the
   bend. Fluorophores positioned on either side of both operators allowed
   direct Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) detection of parallel
   (P1) and antiparallel (A1, A2) DNA looping topologies anchored by
   V-shaped LacI. Combining fluorophore position variant landscapes allows
   calculation of the P1, A1 and A2 populations from FRET efficiencies and
   also reveals extended low-FRET loops proposed to form via LacI opening.
   The addition of isopropyl-beta-d-thio-galactoside (IPTG) destabilizes
   but does not eliminate the loops, and IPTG does not redistribute loops
   among high-FRET topologies. In some cases, subsequent addition of excess
   LacI does not reduce FRET further, suggesting that IPTG stabilizes
   extended or other low-FRET loops. The data align well with rod mechanics
   models for the energetics of DNA looping topologies. At the peaks of the
   predicted energy landscape for V-shaped loops, the proposed extended
   loops are more stable and are observed instead, showing that future
   models must consider protein flexibility.}},

Title = {{Unknown Aspects of Self-Assembly of PbS Microscale Superstructures}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A lot of interesting and sophisticated examples of nanoparticle (NP)
   self-assembly (SA) are known. From both fundamental and technological
   standpoints, this field requires advancements in three principle
   directions: (a) understanding the mechanism and driving forces of
   three-dimensional (3D) SA with both nano- and microlevels of
   organization; (b) understanding disassembly/deconstruction processes;
   and (c) finding synthetic methods of assembly into continuous
   superstructures without Insulating bafflers. From this perspective, we
   investigated the formation of well-known star-like Pb5 superstructures
   and found a number of previously unknown or overlooked aspects that can
   advance the knowledge of NP self-assembly in these three directions. The
   primary one is that the formation of large seemingly monocrystalline Pb5
   superstructures with multiple levels of octahedral symmetry can be
   explained only by SA of small octahedral NPs. We found five distinct
   periods in the formation PbS hyperbranched stars: (1) nucleation of
   early Pb5 NPs with an average diameter of 31 nm; (2) assembly into
   100-500 nm octahedral mesocrystals; (3) assembly into 1000-2500 nm
   hyperbranched stars; (4) assembly and ionic recrystallization into
   six-arm rods accompanied by disappearance of fine nanoscale structure;
   (5) deconstruction into rods and cuboctahedral NPs. The switches in
   assembly patterns between the periods occur due to variable dominance of
   pattern-determining forces that include van der Waals and electrostatic
   (charge charge, dipole dipole, and polarization) Interactions. The
   superstructure deconstruction is triggered by chemical changes In the
   deep eutectic solvent (DES) used as the media. PbS superstructures can
   be excellent models for fundamental studies of nanoscale organization
   and SA manufacturing of (opto)electronics and energy-harvesting devices
   which require organization of PbS components at multiple scales.}},

Abstract = {{Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have great potentials for future
   cell-based therapeutics. However, their mechanosensitivity to
   biophysical signals from the cellular microenvironment is not well

   for accurate control and patterning of nanoroughnes on glass surfaces.
   Our results demonstrated that nanotopography could provide a potent
   regulatory signal over different hESC behaviors, including cell
   morphology, adhesion, proliferation, clonal expansion, and self-renewal.
   Our results indicated that topological sensing of hESCs might include
   feedback regulation involving mechanosensory integrin-mediated
   cell-matrix adhesion, myosin II, and E-cadherin. Our results also
   demonstrated that cellular responses to nanotopography were cell-type
   specific, and as such, we could generate a spatially segregated
   coculture system for hESCs and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts using patterned
   nanorough glass surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding energy dissipation at the nanoscale requires the ability
   to probe temperature fields with nanometer resolution. Here, we describe
   an ultra-high vacuum (UHV)-based scanning thermal microscope (SThM)
   technique that is capable of quantitatively mapping temperature fields
   with similar to 15 mK temperature resolution and similar to 10 nm
   spatial resolution. In this technique, a custom fabricated atomic force
   microscope (AFM) cantilever, with a nanoscale Au-Cr thermocouple
   Integrated into the tip of the probe, is used to measure temperature
   fields of surfaces. Operation in an UHV environment eliminates parasitic
   heat transport between the tip and the sample enabling quantitative
   measurement of temperature fields on metal and dielectric surfaces with
   nanoscale resolution. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique
   by directly imaging thermal fields in the vicinity of a 200 nm wide,
   self-heated, Pt line. Our measurements are in excellent agreement with
   computational results-unambiguously demonstrating the quantitative
   capabilities of the technique. UHV-SThM techniques will play an
   important role in the study of energy dissipation in nanometer-sized
   electronic and photonic devices and the study of phonon and electron
   transport at the nanoscale.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{A novel model-free iterative adaptive controller is presented for
   low-power control of piezoelectric actuators. The controller uses simple
   adaptation rules based on known general behavior of piezoelectric
   actuators to adjust on-off switching times to drive piezoelectric
   actuators through a desired transient step motion. Adaptation rules are
   based on small numbers of measurements taken during each iteration of
   the actuator movement. Combined with the use of only on-off control
   inputs, controller implementation can be possible at much lower overall
   power levels than would be needed to implement a conventional control
   strategy such as through pulse-width-modulation (PWM) with real-time
   feedback. Such power savings are particularly important for the intended
   controller application to piezoelectric microactuators driving
   autonomous terrestrial micro-robots. A method for predicting convergence
   of systems with nominally linear dynamics and unknown, bounded
   nonlinearities is described, and applied to a sample target
   piezoelectric actuator. The controller is tested in simulation and
   experimentally on a piezoelectric cantilever actuator, and shows
   predicted convergence to the desired response. Copyright (C) 2011 John

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{389-396}},

Abstract = {{Nemaline myopathy is one of the most common and severe non-dystrophic
   muscle diseases of childhood. Patients typically present in infancy with
   hypotonia, weakness, delayed motor development, and bulbar and
   respiratory difficulties. Mutations in six different genes are
   associated with nemaline myopathy, with nebulin mutations being the most
   common. No treatments or disease-modifying therapies have been
   identified for this disease. One of the major barriers to treatment
   development is the lack of models amenable to rapid and coordinated
   testing of potential therapeutic strategies. To overcome this barrier,
   we have characterized the first zebrafish model of nemaline myopathy.
   This model, termed neb, harbors a recessive mutation in the nebulin gene
   that results in decreased Nebulin protein levels, a severe motor
   phenotype and premature lethality. In addition to impaired motor
   function, neb zebrafish exhibit many of the features associated with
   human nemaline myopathy. These include impaired force generation,
   altered thin filament length and the presence of specific
   histopathological changes, including the formation of nemaline bodies.
   In summary, neb zebrafish mirror the genetic, clinical and pathological
   aspects of nemaline myopathy due to NEB mutation, and thus are an
   excellent model for future therapy development for this devastating
   disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The strain-mediated evolution of epitaxial ZnTe/ZnSe quantum structures
   is studied at the atomic scale using spherical aberration-corrected
   scanning transmission electron microscopy, coupled with electronic
   properties characterized by photoluminescence spectroscopy. The growth
   development of these buried quantum dots clearly demonstrates a
   homogeneous profile with similar pyramidal geometry rather than bi-modal
   distribution; contradicting prior reports on ZnTe/ZnSe quantum dots. The
   result is consistent with atomistic theoretical calculations on strain
   distribution and electronic structure of a modeled quantum dot of
   similar geometry using a valence force field model. It is also found
   that the transition from 2-D islands to 3-D quantum dots involves
   thermally activated carrier transfer process and follows up with
   formation of extended defects at the quantum dot surface, acting as an
   effective source for remnant misfit strain relaxation. The new physical
   understanding concerning the growth of self-assembled ZnTe/ZnSe quantum
   dots embedded in the active regions provides important information for
   the measures to control the properties of buried ZnTe quantum dots,
   setting up a key footstep in developing novel materials of energy

Abstract = {{Methanobactin (mb) is the first characterized example of a chalkophore,
   a class of copper-binding chromopeptides similar to iron-binding
   siderophores. Structural, redox, themodynamic, and spectral studies on
   chalkophores have focused almost exclusively on the mb from Methylosinus
   trichosporium OB3b (mb-OB3b). The structural characterization of a
   second mb from Methylocystis strain SB2 (mb-SB2) provides a means to
   examine the core structural features and metal binding properties of
   this group of chromopeptides. With the exception of the 5-membered rings
   (either oxazolone or imidazolone), enethiol groups, and the N-terminus
   oxo group, the structure of mb-SB2 differs markedly from mb-OB3b. In
   particular the amino acids commonly associated with metal coordination
   and redox activity found in mb-083b, Cys, Met, and Try, are replaced by
   Ala or are missing in mb-SB2. In this report the spectral and
   thermodynamic properties of mb-SB2 are presented and compared to
   mb-OB3b. The results demonstrate that the spectral and basic copper
   binding properties of both methanobactins are similar and the unique
   copper binding capacity of both methanobactins lies primarily in the
   pair of five-membered rings and associated enethiol groups. The
   remaining portions of the methanobactin appear to provide the
   scaffolding that brings together of the two ring systems to produce the
   tetrahedral binding site for copper binding. (C) 2012 Published by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A general analytical expression is derived for calculating the total
   scattering cross-section of an aggregate of nanoparticles. The approach
   is based on the far zone approximation and repeated use of recursive
   relations for Bessel functions and Legendre polynomials. In comparison
   with the existing formula for total scattering cross-section, the
   expression converges faster and makes it easier to analyze the terms
   that characterize the interactive coupling between nanoparticles during
   multiple scattering of electromagnetic waves. The expressions are valid
   for particle aggregates in which no two particles are in direct contact.
   Calculated results compare well with measurements for a nanoshell dimer.
   For a linear chain of particles with the chain axis parallel to the
   polarization direction of the electric field, analysis shows that the
   red-shift of resonance peaks results primarily from electrons in metal
   shells of two adjacent particles oscillating out-of-phase to cancel each
   other's radiation effects. Multi-scattering in aggregates with more
   complex arrangements may be explained by combining the effects of linear
   particle chains.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient compression, torsion, and bending behavior of hollow
   structural sections (HSS) combined with their high strength-to-weight
   ratio provide an opportunity to further their use in seismic
   applications and improve on structural performance. However, current
   applications of HSS in seismic systems are restricted because of a
   limited understanding of their cyclic bending behavior. To characterize
   the behavior of HSS under pure bending and determine limiting values for
   their use up to large rotation levels, 11 different HSS beam members
   ranging in size from HSS 203.2 x 101.6 x 6.4 mm to HSS 304.8 x 152.4 x
   6.4 mm with thickness of 6.4 and 9.5 mm are tested under cyclic bending
   loads. The moment-rotation results suggest that the width-thickness and
   depth-thickness ratios are important in determining whether a stable
   plastic hinge can be sustained during cycling, ensuring adequate
   ductility. Cycling effects associated with increasing rotation levels
   and multiple cycles at the same level are considered with respect to the
   degradation of the moment capacity, rotation capacity, secant stiffness,
   and energy dissipation. It is clear that the influence of the
   width-thickness ratio and depth-thickness ratio is not independent of
   one other. Flange strains also provide an understanding of how yielding
   propagates along the length of the member and at what point local

Abstract = {{The paper presents an overview of the various analyses of flight
   dynamics, stability, and control of flapping wing micro-air vehicles
   available in the literature. The potential benefits of flapping wing
   micro-air vehicles for civil, military, and search and rescue operations
   are numerous. The majority of the flight dynamics research involves the
   standard aircraft (6DOF) equations of motion, although a growth is
   evident in examining the multibody flight dynamics models of flapping
   wing micro-air vehicles. The stability of flapping wing micro-air
   vehicles is largely studied in the vicinity of hover and forward flight.
   The majority of stability studies focus on linear, time-invariant
   stability in the vicinity of reference flight conditions, such as hover
   or forward flight. The consistent result is that flapping wing micro-air
   vehicles are unstable in an open loop setting. The unstable result is
   based on linear and nonlinear stability analyses. Control has been
   demonstrated for hovering and forward flight through various methods,
   both linear and nonlinear in nature. The entirety of reported research
   into the stability and control of flapping wing micro-air vehicles has
   neglected the mass effects of the wings on the position and orientation
   of the central body. Successful control of a flapping wing micro-air
   vehicle, with the wings' mass effects included, is still an open
   research area. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Predicting Emergency Department Volume Using Forecasting Methods to
   Create a ``Surge Response{''} for Noncrisis Events}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{569-576}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: This study investigated whether emergency department (ED)
   variables could be used in mathematical models to predict a future surge
   in ED volume based on recent levels of use of physician capacity. The
   models may be used to guide decisions related to on-call staffing in
   non-crisis-related surges of patient volume.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using information
   spanning July 2009 through June 2010 from a large urban teaching
   hospital with a Level I trauma center. A comparison of significance was
   used to assess the impact of multiple patient-specific variables on the
   state of the ED. Physician capacity was modeled based on historical
   physician treatment capacity and productivity. Binary logistic
   regression analysis was used to determine the probability that the
   available physician capacity would be sufficient to treat all patients
   forecasted to arrive in the next time period. The prediction horizons
   used were 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, and
   12 hours. Five consecutive months of patient data from July 2010 through
   November 2010, similar to the data used to generate the models, was used
   to validate the models. Positive predictive values, Type I and Type II
   errors, and real-time accuracy in predicting noncrisis surge events were
   used to evaluate the forecast accuracy of the models.
   Results: The ratio of new patients requiring treatment over total
   physician capacity (termed the care utilization ratio {[}CUR]) was
   deemed a robust predictor of the state of the ED (with a CUR greater
   than 1 indicating that the physician capacity would not be sufficient to
   treat all patients forecasted to arrive). Prediction intervals of 30
   minutes, 8 hours, and 12 hours performed best of all models analyzed,
   with deviances of 1.000, 0.951, and 0.864, respectively. A 95\%
   significance was used to validate the models against the July 2010
   through November 2010 data set. Positive predictive values ranged from
   0.738 to 0.872, true positives ranged from 74\% to 94\%, and true
   negatives ranged from 70\% to 90\% depending on the threshold used to
   determine the state of the ED with the 30-minute prediction model.
   Conclusions: The CUR is a new and robust indicator of an ED system's
   performance. The study was able to model the tradeoff of longer time to
   response versus shorter but more accurate predictions, by investigating
   different prediction intervals. Current practice would have been
   improved by using the proposed models and would have identified the
   surge in patient volume earlier on noncrisis days.

   samples were characterized thoroughly by size exclusion chromatography
   with light scattering detection (SEC-LS) and found to exhibit controlled
   molecular weights, as well as narrow polydispersity indices (PDIs of
   1.01-1.06). Temperature gradient interaction chromatography, a method
   with far superior resolution as compared to SEC, also shows that these

Abstract = {{Self-degradable antimicrobial copolymers bearing cationic side chains
   and main-chain ester linkages were synthesized using the simultaneous
   chain- and step-growth radical polymerization of t-butyl acrylate and
   3-butenyl 2-chloropropionate, followed by the transformation of t-butyl
   groups into primary ammonium salts. We prepared a series of copolymers
   with different structural features in terms of molecular weight, monomer
   composition, amine functionality, and side chain structures to examine
   the effect of polymer properties on their antimicrobial and hemolytic
   activities. The acrylate copolymers containing primary amine side chains
   displayed moderate antimicrobial activity against E. colt but were
   relatively hemolytic. The acrylate copolymer with quaternary ammonium
   groups and the acrylamide copolymers showed low or no antimicrobial and
   hemolytic activities. An acrylate copolymer with primary amine side
   chains degraded to lower molecular weight oligomers with lower
   antimicrobial activity in aqueous solution. This degradation was due to
   amidation of the ester groups of the polymer chains by the nucleophilic
   addition of primary amine groups in the side chains resulting in
   cleavage of the polymer main chain. The degradation mechanism was
   studied in detail by model reactions between amine compounds and
   precursor copolymers.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of amphiphilic random copolymers
   were modulated by the structure of the cationic side chain spacer arms,
   including 2-aminoethylene, 4-aminobutylene, and 69 6-aminohexylene
   groups. Cationic amphiphilic random copolymers with ethyl methacrylate
   (EMA) comonomer were prepared with a range of comonomer fractions, and
   the library of copolymers was screened for antimicrobial and hemolytic
   activities. Copolymers with 4-aminobutylene cationic side chains showed
   an order of magnitude enhancement in their antimicrobial activity
   relative to those with 2-aminoethylene spacer arms, without causing
   adverse hemolysis. When the spacer arms were further elongated to
   hexylene, the copolymers displayed potent antimicrobial and hemolytic
   activities. The 4 aminobutylene side chain appears to be the optimal
   spacer arm length for maximal antimicrobial potency and minimal
   hemolysis, when combined with hydrophobic ethylmethacrylate in a roughly
   70/30 ratio. The copolymers displayed relatively rapid bactericidal
   kinetics and broad-spectrum activity against a panel of Gram-positive
   and Gram-negative bacteria. The effect of the spacer arms on the polymer
   conformation in the membrane-bound state was investigated by molecular
   dynamics simulations. The polymer backbones adopt an extended chain
   conformation, parallel to the membrane surface. A facially amphiphilic
   conformation at the membrane surface was observed, with the primary
   ammonium groups localized at the lipid phoshophate region and the
   nonpolar side chains of EMA comonomers buried in the hydrophobic
   membrane environment. This study demonstrates that the antimicrobial
   activity and molecular conformation of amphiphilic methacrylate random
   copolymers can be modulated by adjustment of cationic side chain spacer
   arms.}},

Abstract = {{A new directive ultra-wideband antenna based on rectangular waveguide
   aperture antennas is presented. Conventional rectangular aperture
   antennas are limited by the single mode operation of the waveguide as
   well as relatively long and narrowband resonant feeds. To overcome these
   limitations, we developed a new rectangular waveguide antenna feeding
   structure that can establish an aperture field distribution very similar
   to that of the fundamental waveguide mode with a relatively short
   waveguide section and over two octaves of bandwidth. The overall antenna
   size is where is 0.55 lambda(m) x 0.27 lambda(m) x 0.18 lambda(m) where
   lambda(m) wavelength at the minimum operating frequency. Due to the
   planar aperture of the antenna, a polarizer could be added to the
   antenna to ensure good cross-polarization performance with fabrication
   tolerances. The proposed feed requires a balun structure, and thus an
   integrated balun design is presented. It is found that a standard balun
   would interact with the antenna structure and thus a modified design was
   implemented. The antenna was fabricated and measured. The antenna had
   VSWR < 2.5 from 1.08 to 4.9 GHz and the measured gain showed almost
   constant aperture gain which increases from 5.3 dBi at the low frequency
   end to 11 dBi at the high frequency edge.}},

Abstract = {{Autofocus algorithms are used to restore images in nonideal synthetic
   aperture radar imaging systems. In this paper, we propose a bilinear
   parametric model for the unknown image and the nuisance phase parameters
   and derive an efficient maximum-likelihood autofocus (MLA) algorithm. In
   the special case of a simple image model and a narrow range of look
   angles, MLA coincides with the successful multichannel autofocus (MCA).
   MLA can be interpreted as a generalization of MCA to a larger class of
   models with a larger range of look angles. We analyze its advantages
   over previous extensions of MCA in terms of identifiability conditions
   and noise sensitivity. As a byproduct, we also propose numerical
   approximations to the difficult constant modulus quadratic program that
   lies at the core of these algorithms. We demonstrate the superior
   performance of our proposed methods using computer simulations in both
   the correct and mismatched system models. MLA performs better than other
   methods, both in terms of the mean squared error and visual quality of
   the restored image.}},

Abstract = {{Daily driving missions provide the fundamental information required to

   proposed temporal distribution model can capture departure and arrival
   time distributions with a small number of samples by statistically
   relating the distributions. Then, representative naturalistic cycles are
   constructed through a stochastic process and a subsequent statistical
   analysis with respect to driving distance. They are randomly assigned to
   the temporal distribution model to build up complete daily driving
   missions. The proposed approach enables the assessment of the impact on

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the intrinsic aspects of power management for
   hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEV). A vehicle power
   distribution density function is used to describe the drive cycle
   characteristics. An electric driveline loss is introduced to describe
   the minimum system loss for a given mechanical power output, and a
   piecewise linear fuel consumption model is used to capture essential
   characteristics such as idle fuel consumption rate, peak efficiency, and
   the minimum power to reach peak efficiency. Models are based on the
   assumption that both machines operate at the optimal speed and torque
   for a given mechanical power as if they are coupled with an ideal
   continuous variable transmission (CVT). The power management strategy is
   represented with a pair of power parameters that describe the power
   threshold for turning on the engine and the optimum battery power in
   engine-on operations. The model of a parallel hybrid electric powertrain
   is constructed to obtain optimal solutions that maximize the fuel
   economy for a given battery energy depletion and for a general vehicle
   power distribution density function. One-dimensional loss models of two
   power sources as approximations to real machines coupled with hypothetic
   CVTs are introduced to solve the optimization problem analytically. It
   is found that the optimal minimum engine power is the controlling factor
   in minimizing the total fuel consumption for the given battery energy
   depletion targets and that the optimal power is solely determined by
   powertrain characteristics. Numerical simulations validated the
   properties of the optimal power solutions obtained through analytic
   approaches. The significance of the results to real-world HEV and PHEV
   applications are also discussed.}},

   maintain enough signal availability for effective communication. In
   addition, the developed RTLS uses RFID to retain the latter's benefits

   two case studies have been conducted; the results show great potential

Abstract = {{Dynamically compacted sands often exhibit a drop in cone penetration
   resistance immediately after compaction, but a gradual increase in the
   resistance occurs in a matter of weeks and months. An explanation of the
   former is sought in analysis of the stress state immediately after a
   dynamic disturbance, and a justification for the latter is found in the
   micromechanics process of static fatigue (or stress corrosion cracking)
   of the micromorphologic features at the contacts between sand grains.
   The delayed fracturing of contact asperities leads to grain convergence,
   followed by an increase in contact stiffness and an increase in elastic
   modulus of sand at the macroscopic scale. Time-dependent increase in
   small-strain stiffness of sand under a sustained load is a phenomenon
   confirmed by earlier experiments. It is argued that the initial drop in
   the cone penetration resistance after dynamic compaction is caused by a
   drop in the horizontal stress after the disturbance. The subsequent
   gradual increase in the penetration resistance is not a result of
   increasing strength, but it is owed to the time-delayed increase in
   stiffness of sand, causing increase in horizontal stress under
   one-dimensional strain conditions. This process is a consequence of
   static fatigue at contacts between grains. The strength of sand after
   dynamic compaction increases as soon as the fabric of the compacted sand
   is formed and is little affected by the process of grain convergence in
   the time after compaction. Contact stiffness, with its dependence on
   static fatigue, holds information about the previous loading process,
   and it is a memory parameter of a kind; this information is lost after a
   disturbance, such as dynamic compaction, in which new contacts are
   formed. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations, discrete
   element simulations, and energy considerations are carried out to make
   the argument for the proposed hypothesis stronger. DOI:

Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{Traditional methods for calculations of active loads on retaining
   structures provide dependable forces, but these methods do not indicate
   reliably the location of the resultant load on the walls. The Coulomb
   method does not address the load distribution because it utilizes
   equilibrium of forces, whereas the Rankine stress distribution provides
   linear increase of the load with depth. Past experimental studies
   indicate intricate distributions dependent on the mode of displacement
   of the wall before reaching the limit state. The discrete element method
   was used to simulate soil-retaining structure interaction, and force
   chains characteristic of arching were identified. Arching appears to be
   the primary cause affecting the load distribution. A differential slice
   technique was used to mimic the load distributions seen in physical
   experiments. The outcome indicates that rotation modes of wall movement
   are associated with uneven mobilization of strength on the surface
   separating the moving backfill from the soil at rest. Calculations show
   that the location of the centroid of the active load distribution behind
   a translating wall is approximately 0.40 of the wall height above the
   base, but for a wall rotating about its top point, the location of the
   resultant is at approximately 0.55H. In the third case, rotation about
   the base, the location of the calculated centroid of the stress
   distribution on the wall is slightly below one-third of the wall height.

Abstract = {{Carbon materials suffer from corrosion at the cathode of polymer
   electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In the presence of water,
   carbon support materials are oxidized to carbon dioxide even at low
   potentials. Hence, nowadays it is very fashionable to look for
   alternative support materials, like oxides or conductive polymers. To
   gain the maximum performance for a new material one should also consider
   an appropriate electrode structure. This study shows the results for the
   incorporation of nanosized alternative support materials into advanced
   electrode architectures. Commercially available indium tin oxide (ITO)
   nanoparticles (<50 nm) are used as support for Pt nanoparticles in
   combination with Nafion-coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on
   the cathode side of a PEMFC. The MWCNTs promote a high electronic
   conductivity and help to form a porous network, which could accommodate
   the Pt/ITO nanoparticles. The microscopic investigations show a
   homogeneous electrode structure composed of Pt/ITO and MWCNT/Nafion
   multilayer. Single cell measurements show a maximum power density of 73
   mW cm-2 and a Pt utilization of 1468 mW mgPt-1 for the cathode. The
   performance data and the Pt utilization are comparable to a standard
   Pt/carbon black electrode possessing the same Pt loading in the
   electrode. Beside this, it is shown for the first time that ITO serves
   as support material under real fuel cell conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Intravascular catheters used in clinical practice can activate
   platelets, leading to thrombus formation and stagnation of blood flow.
   Nitric oxide (NO)-releasing polymers have been shown previously to
   reduce clot formation on a number of blood contacting devices. In this
   work, trilaminar NO-releasing silicone catheters were fabricated and
   tested for their thrombogenicity. All catheters had specifications of L
   = 6 cm, inner diameter = 21 gauge (0.0723 cm), outer diameter = 12 gauge
   (0.2052 cm), and NO-releasing layer thickness = 200 +/- 11 mu m. Control
   and NO-releasing catheters were characterized in vitro for their NO flux
   and NO release duration by gas phase chemiluminescence measurements. The
   catheters were then implanted in the right and left internal jugular
   veins of (N = 6 and average weight. 3 kg) adult male rabbits for 4 hours
   thrombogenicity testing. Platelet counts and function, methemoglobin
   (metHb), hemoglobin (Hb), and white cell counts and functional time
   (defined as patency time of catheter) were monitored as measured
   outcomes. Nitric oxide-releasing catheters (N = 6) maintained an average
   flux above (2 +/- 0.5) x 10(-10) mol/min/cm(2) for more than 24 hours,
   whereas controls showed no NO release. Methemoglobin, Hb, white cell,
   and platelet counts and platelet function at 4 hours were not
   significantly different from baseline (alpha = 0.05). However, clots on
   controls were visibly larger and prevented blood draws at a
   significantly (p < 0.05) earlier time (2.3 +/- 0.7 hours) into the
   experiment, whereas all NO-releasing catheters survived the entire 4
   hours test period. Results indicate that catheter NO flux levels
   attenuated thrombus formation in a short-term animal model. ASAIO

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Background This is the first study of suicide attempts and completions
   in the emergency department (ED) in a large national medical system.
   Methods All root cause analysis (RCA) reports completed of suicides and
   suicide attempts that occurred in ED in the Veterans Health
   Administration between 1 December 1999 and 31 December 2009 were
   reviewed. The method, location, anchor point for hanging and implement
   for cutting as well as the root causes were categorised.
   Results Ten per cent of all RCA reports of suicides and suicide attempts
   that occur within the hospital occur in the ED. Hanging, cutting and
   strangulation were the most common methods. The most common anchor point
   for hanging was doors, and the most common implement for cutting was a
   razor blade. In eight of the 10 cases of cutting, the implement was
   brought into the ED. The most common root causes were problems
   communicating risk and being short-staffed.
   Conclusions Based on these results the following recommendations are
   made for helping to reduce suicide attempts in the ED: (1) use a
   systematic protocol and checklist to review mental health holding areas
   periodically in the ED for suicidal hazards; (2) develop and implement
   specialised protocols for suicidal patients that include continuous
   observation when possible; (3) conduct thorough contraband searches with
   suicidal patients; (4) designate specialised holding areas, when
   practically possible, for suicidal patients that are free of anchor
   points for hanging, sharps and medications, and medical equipment; and
   are isolated from exits to reduce the risk of elopement.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma production or plasma injection in liquid water affords one the
   opportunity to nonthermally inject advanced oxidation processes into
   water for the purpose of purification or chemical processing. Such
   technology could potentially revolutionize the treatment of drinking
   water, as well as current methods of chemical processing through the
   elimination of physical catalysts. Presented here is an overview of
   current water treatment technology, its limitations, and the future,
   which may feature plasma-based advanced oxidation techniques. As such,
   this field represents an emerging and active area of research. The role
   that plasma-driven water chemistry can play in addressing emerging
   threats to the water supply is discussed using case study examples.
   Limitations of conventional plasma injection approaches include limited
   throughput capacity, electrode erosion, and reduced process volume. At
   the University of Michigan, we are investigating two potential
   approaches designed to circumvent such issues. These include direct
   plasma injection using an underwater DBD plasma jet and the direct
   production of plasmas in isolated underwater bubbles via a pulsed
   electric field. These approaches are presented here, along with the

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to introduce a new immunological bead-free
   cell detection method using quantum dots (QDs) as reporter markers for
   foodborne pathogen detection. QDs are nanosized particles with long-term
   photostability, high quantum yield, broad absorption spectra, and
   narrow, symmetric emission and high signal-to-noise ratio. The chemical
   compound {[}(1-ethyl-3-3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide
   hydrochloride] (EDC) and protein A were used as crosslinkers for
   manufacturing QD-antibody conjugates. To minimize the inhibition of QD
   fluorescence by the magnetic beads, the beads were removed after the
   primary pathogen isolation and before fluorescence measurement.
   Detection signals were increased fourfold after employing the bead-free
   isolation method. With a 24-h enrichment, the bead-free QD-facilitated
   detection method was able to detect 10 CFU/g Escherichia coli O157:H7
   and Salmonella from artificially contaminated ground beef. To our
   knowledge, this detection method is the first research that combined a
   new EDC-protein A QD-labeling technique and bead-free fluorescence
   measurement to detect E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella in ground beef. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{289}},
Pages = {{210-217}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Carbide-supported metal catalysts have been demonstrated to be highly
   active for a number of reactions including water gas shift and
   electrochemical hydrogen evolution. Their activity appears to be a
   consequence of intimate interactions between the metal and support.
   These interactions as well as the structures and compositions depend on
   the conditions used during preparation. The objective of research
   described in this paper was to define key aspects regarding the
   adsorption and reaction of metal precursor complexes with unpassivated,
   high surface area Mo2C powders during wet impregnation. The rate of
   metal deposition and the final state of the metal were functions of the
   nature of the precursor (i.e., counter ion), electrostatic interactions,
   and red-ox reactions with the Mo2C surface. The deposition rate
   decreased in the following order: H2PtCl6 similar to Pd(NH3)(4)(NO3)(2)
   similar to CuCl2 similar to Cu(NO3)(2) > Co(NO3)(2) similar to
   Ni(NO3)(2) >> CoCl2 similar to NiCl2 similar to FeCl2 similar to
   Fe(NO3)(3). The observed adsorption and red-ox behavior suggest that
   supporting metals onto native carbide surfaces could result in
   properties that are significantly different from those for metals
   supported on oxidized carbide surfaces. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The high strain-rate constitutive behavior of polymer composites with
   various natural fibers is studied. Hemp, hemp/glass hybrid, cellulose,
   and wheat straw-reinforced polymeric composites have been manufactured,
   and a split-Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus has been designed to
   measure the dynamic stress-strain response of the materials. Using the
   apparatus, compressive stress-strain curves have been obtained that
   reveal the materials' constitutive characteristics at strain rates
   between 600 and 2400 strain/s. Primary findings indicate that natural
   fibers in thermoset composites dissipate energy at lower levels of
   stress and higher strain than glass-reinforced composites. In the case
   of thermoplastic matrices, the effect on energy dissipation of natural
   fibers vs. conventional talc reinforcements is highly dependent on resin
   properties. Natural fibers in polypropylene homopolymer show improved
   reinforcement but have degraded energy dissipation compared to talc.
   Whereas in polypropylene copolymer, natural fibers result in improved
   energy dissipation compared to talc. These data are useful for proper
   design, analysis, and simulation of lightweight biocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{We proposed and investigated a novel adaptive two-dimensional (2-D)
   microgas chromatography system, which consists of one 1st-dimensional
   column, multiple parallel 2nd-dimensional columns, and a decision-making
   module. The decision-making module, installed between the 1st- and
   2nd-dimensional columns, normally comprises an on-column nondestructive
   vapor detector, a flow routing system, and a computer that monitors the
   detection signal from the detector and sends out the trigger signal to
   the flow routing system. During the operation, effluents from the
   1st-dimensional Column are first detected by the detector and, then,
   depending on the signal generated by the detector, routed to one of the
   2nd-dimensional columns sequentially for further separation. As compared
   to conventional 2-D GC systems, the proposed adaptive GC scheme has a
   number of unique and advantageous features. First and foremost, the
   multiple parallel columns are independent of each other. Therefore,
   their length, stationary phase, flow rate, and temperature can be
   optimized for best separation and maximal versatility. In addition, the
   adaptive GC significantly lowers the thermal modulator modulation
   frequency and hence power consumption. Finally, it greatly simplifies
   the postdata analysis process required to reconstruct the 2-D
   chromatogram. In this paper, the underlying working principle and data
   analysis of the adaptive GC was first discussed. Then, separation of a
   mixture of 20 analytes with various volatilities and polarities was
   demonstrated using an adaptive GC system with a single 2nd dimensional
   column. Finally, an adaptive GC system with dual 2nd-dimensional columns
   was employed, in conjunction with temperature ramping, in a practical
   application to separate a mixture of plant emitted volatile organic
   compounds with significantly shortened analysis time.}},

Abstract = {{The peripheral-finned tube is a new geometry aimed at avoiding
   moisture-condensate blockage hindering of the air-side heat transfer, by
   allowing for robust air flow pathways. It consists of a porous structure
   formed by periodic, radial-hexagonal fin arrangements of different
   radial extents mounted with a 30 offset from its neighboring level.
   Here, the air-side pressure drop and the heat transfer characteristics
   of five different heat exchanger prototypes with different geometric
   characteristics, such as the radial fin length, fin distribution, and
   heat exchanger length, were evaluated experimentally in an open-loop
   wind-tunnel calorimeter. The results demonstrate the effective
   performance, i.e., the pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics,
   of this new heat exchanger. A one-dimensional theoretical model based on
   the porous media treatment was also developed to predict the
   thermal-hydraulic behavior of the heat exchanger. The model incorporates
   the actual fin geometry into the calculation of the air-side porosity.
   The air-side permeability is calculated according to the Kozeny-Carman
   model and the particle-diameter based analysis. The model predicts the
   experimental data within a few percent RMS, depending on the
   correlations used for the friction coefficient and interstitial Nusselt

Abstract = {{We report the first application of wavelet-based denoising (noise
   removal) methods to time-domain box-car fluorescence lifetime imaging
   microscopy (FLIM) images and compare the results to novel total
   variation (TV) denoising methods. Methods were tested first on
   artificial images and then applied to low-light live-cell images.
   Relative to undenoised images, TV methods could improve lifetime
   precision up to 10-fold in artificial images, while preserving the
   overall accuracy of lifetime and amplitude values of a
   single-exponential decay model and improving local lifetime fitting in
   live-cell images. Wavelet-based methods were at least 4-fold faster than
   TV methods, but could introduce significant inaccuracies in recovered
   lifetime values. The denoising methods discussed can potentially enhance
   a variety of FLIM applications, including live-cell, in vivo animal, or
   endoscopic imaging studies, especially under challenging imaging
   conditions such as low-light or fast video-rate imaging. (C) 2012

Journal = {{MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Treloar carried out experiments on square rubber sheets that were loaded
   by equal in-plane forces along their edges. Kearsley observed from
   Treloar's data that the deformations were equal biaxial extensions for
   smaller forces, but became unequal biaxial extensions beyond a larger
   force. By means of a simple non-linear elasticity problem, Kearsley
   showed that the governing equations had multiple solutions that allowed
   for bifurcation from an equal biaxial to an unequal biaxial deformation.
   The present work considers this bifurcation phenomenon if Treloar's
   experiments were to be carried out in the temperature range, say, of
   100-150 degrees C. Tobolsky showed that rubber in this temperature range
   undergoes microstructural evolution attributed to a chemical process of
   scission and crosslinking of macromolecular junctions. When loaded by
   equal in-plane forces along its edges, the rubber sheet can be expected
   to undergo equal biaxial extensional creep. The possibility is
   considered that there may be a time when the equal biaxial extensional
   creep history branches (bifurcates) into an unequal biaxial extensional
   creep history.
   Kearsley's analysis is revisited using a constitutive theory developed
   for rubber undergoing thermally induced microstructural changes. It is
   assumed that there is a time when the equal biaxial extension history
   branches into an unequal biaxial extension history. A branching
   condition for determining this time is established. A numerical example
   shows the existence of a branching time and the subsequent branching of
   an equal biaxial extension history into an unequal biaxial extension
   history. After branching, the governing equations allow both equal
   biaxial and unequal biaxial extension histories. It is assumed that the
   sheet follows the deformation history that maximizes the rate of
   dissipation, which turns out to be the unequal biaxial extension
   history.}},

Abstract = {{We study networks that display community structure-groups of nodes
   within which connections are unusually dense. Using methods from random
   matrix theory, we calculate the spectra of such networks in the limit of
   large size, and hence demonstrate the presence of a phase transition in
   matrix methods for community detection, such as the popular modularity
   maximization method. The transition separates a regime in which such
   methods successfully detect the community structure from one in which
   the structure is present but is not detected. By comparing these results
   with recent analyses of maximum-likelihood methods, we are able to show
   that spectral modularity maximization is an optimal detection method in
   the sense that no other method will succeed in the regime where the

Abstract = {{Asymptotic formulas are derived for the mean-squared error (MSE)
   distortion of N-level uniform scalar quantizers designed to be MSE
   optimal for one density function, but applied to another, as N ->
   infinity. These formulas, which are based on the Euler-Maclaurin
   formula, are then applied with generalized gamma, Bucklew-Gallagher, and
   Hui-Neuhoff density functions as the designed-for and applied-to
   densities. It is found that the mismatch between the designed-for and
   applied-to densities can disturb the delicate balance between granular
   and overload distortions in optimal quantization, with the result that,
   generally speaking, the granular or overload distortion dominates,
   respectively, depending on whether the applied-to density function has a
   lighter or heavier tail than the designed-for density. Specifically, in

Abstract = {{Detecting and debugging faults more efficiently can significantly
   improve the performance of systems, and a first step toward fault
   detection is anomaly detection. A new anomaly detection solution is
   proposed in this paper for event-based systems that consist of processes
   that interact through shared resources and that do not have a
   preexisting formal discrete event system model. This solution generates
   models of the system, assesses the models' performance in detecting
   faults, and then uses the models and their performance to detect
   anomalies in new event streams. A new resource-based Petri net formalism
   is introduced to model these types of systems. The model generation uses
   an algorithm based on workflow mining to generate resource-based models.
   The proposed solution is demonstrated on two manufacturing cell

Abstract = {{Hydrogen generation using a high temperature nuclear reactor as a
   thermal driving vector is a promising future option for energy carrier
   production. In this scheme, the heat from the nuclear reactor drives an
   endothermic water-splitting plant, via coupling, through an intermediate
   heat exchanger. Quantitative study of the possible operational or
   accident events within the coupled plant is largely absent from the
   literature. In this paper, seven unique case studies are proposed based
   on a thorough review of possible events. The case studies are: (1) feed
   flow failure from one section of the chemical plant to another with an
   accompanying parametric study of the temperature in an individual
   reaction chamber, (2) product flow failure (recycle) within the chemical
   plant, (3) rupture or explosion within the chemical plant, (4) nuclear
   reactor helium inlet overcooling due to a process holding tank failure,
   (5) helium inlet overcooling as an anticipated transient without
   emergency nuclear reactor shutdown, (6) total failure of the chemical
   plant, (7) control rod insertion in the nuclear reactor. The qualitative
   parameters of each case study are outlined as well as the basis in
   literature. A previously published modeling scheme is described and
   adapted for application as a simulation platform for these transient
   events. The results of the quantitative case studies are described
   within part II of this paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Integrated probabilistic design of marine propulsors to minimize
   lifetime fuel consumption}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Marine propellers are typically designed to achieve optimal performance
   at a single or a few design points. It is well understood that the
   performance of marine propulsion systems decays at off-design
   conditions, where the system operates for the majority of its life,
   where fuel consumption rates are high and the system as a whole operates
   at lower efficiencies. This paper presents a novel integrated design
   methodology that considers the propeller, prime mover, and vessel as one
   integrated system, and considers the probabilistic operational profile
   of the vessel, to minimize lifetime fuel consumption. The proposed
   design methodology represents a new approach to evaluate the tradeoffs
   between different design objectives and constraints by considering the
   system performance characteristics along with probability of occurrence,
   and hence allows for global optimization of the propeller geometry.
   Results are shown for a pair of fixed-pitch propellers designed for a
   twin-screw naval combatant craft. System performance for a design
   obtained using the proposed methodology is compared with designs
   obtained using traditional point-based design approaches. This
   methodology can be easily extended to investigate the effects of
   variations in resistance, operational profile or additional performance
   criteria, such as safety during extreme operations, lifetime carbon
   emission, and life cycle costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates the utility of rare-earth metal triflate
   catalysts (i.e., Sc(OTf)(3) and In(OTf)(3)) in the (trans)esterification
   of oleic acid as well as the lipids contained within carbonized algal
   biomass using ethanol in the presence of water. Both catalysts are
   highly active between 200 and 235 degrees C with an ethanol:fatty acid
   (EtOH:FA) molar ratio of 10-20:1 and showed a high tolerance for
   moisture. Lipids within hydrochars produced by reacting Chlorella
   protothecoides paste (25\% solids) in high temperature water (220-250
   degrees C) were successfully converted into fatty acid ethyl esters
   (FAEE). The highest FAEE yields (85-98\%) were obtained when hydrochars
   were reacted for 60 min at 215 degrees C with about 11-13 mol\%
   Sc(OTf)(3), a 17-19:1 EtOH:FA molar ratio, and without water. FAEE
   yields remained as high as 93\% in the presence of 9 wt.\% water. Our
   preliminary results warrant further work to optimize triflate-catalyzed
   in situ (trans)esterification at low catalyst and ethanol loadings. (C)

Abstract = {{Conventional battery management systems (BMSs) for electric vehicles
   (EVs) are designed in an ad hoc way, causing the supply of EVs to fall
   behind the market demand. A well-designed and combined hardware-software
   architecture is essential for the efficient management of a large-scale
   battery pack that may consists of thousands of battery cells as in Tesla
   Motors and GM Chevy Volt. We propose a Dependable, Efficient, Scalable
   Architecture (DESA) that effectively monitors a large number of battery
   cells, efficiently controls, and reconfigures, if needed, their
   connection arrangement. DESA supports hierarchical, autonomous
   management of battery cells, where a global BMS orchestrates a group of
   local BMSs. A local controller on each local BMS autonomously manages an
   array of battery cells, and the global controller reconfigures the
   connectivity of such battery-cell arrays in coordination with the local
   controllers. Also, DESA allows individual arrays and local BMSs to be
   selectively powered-off for energy savings. The performance of this
   energy-saving capability is modeled and evaluated using a Markov chain.
   Our evaluation results show that DESA effectively tolerates battery-cell
   failures by an order-of-magnitude-while achieving 7.4 x service cost
   savings-better than a conventional BMS. This superior performance not
   only extends the battery life significantly, but also provides the
   flexibility in supporting diverse electric power demands from a growing
   number of on-board applications.}},

Abstract = {{Patient-associated co-morbidities are a potential cause of postoperative
   complications. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP)
   collects data on patient outcomes to provide risk-adjusted outcomes data
   to participating hospitals. However, operations which may have a high
   distribution of technically-related complications, such as pancreatic
   operations, may not be adequately assessed using such predictive models.
   A combined data set of NSQIP Public Use files (PUF) from 2005 to 2008
   was created. Using this database, multiple logistic regression analyses
   were used to generate a predictive model of 30-day postoperative
   morbidity and mortality for pancreatic operations and all other
   operations recorded in NSQIP. Receiver-operator characteristic curves
   were generated and the area under those curves (AUROC) used to generate
   a c-statistic to assess the model's discriminatory ability.
   Observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios of for mortality and morbidity using
   not only patient-associated co-morbidities, but operation-associated
   information, such as work relative-value units and Current Procedural
   Terminology codes, were generated. Data were analyzed in SPSS.
   In the 4-year period analyzed, there were 7,097 complex pancreatic
   procedures done which were compared to 568,371 procedures that were not.
   For postoperative mortality, the AUROC was less for pancreatic
   operations (0.741) compared to all other operation (0.947) and all other
   inpatient operations (0.927). Similarly for postoperative morbidity, the
   AUROC was less for pancreatic operations (0.598) compared to all other
   operations (0.764) and all other inpatient operations (0.817). However,
   the O/E ratios were similar in both groups for mortality (all other
   operations, 0.94 vs. pancreatic operations, 0.92) and morbidity (0.98
   for both).
   These data imply that the factors used to assess postoperative mortality
   and morbidity may not completely explain postoperative outcomes in
   pancreatic operations. These procedures are technically demanding and
   can have morbidities not related to pre-existing co-morbid conditions;
   therefore, preoperative prediction based on pre-existing co-morbidities
   may have limitations in these types of operations.}},

Abstract = {{A power-split hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) combines the advantages of
   both series and parallel hybrid vehicle architectures by utilizing a
   planetary gear set to split and combine the power produced by electric
   machines and a combustion engine. Because of the different modes of
   operation, devising a near optimal energy management strategy is quite
   challenging and essential for these vehicles. To improve the fuel
   economy of a power-split HEV, we first formulate the energy management
   problem as a nonlinear and constrained optimal control problem. Then two
   different cost functions are defined and model predictive control (MPC)
   strategies are utilized to obtain the power split between the combustion
   engine and electrical machines and the system operating points at each
   sample time. Simulation results on a closed-loop high-fidelity model of
   a power-split HEV over multiple standard drive cycles and with different
   controllers are presented. The results of a nonlinear MPC strategy show
   a noticeable improvement in fuel economy with respect to those of an
   available controller in the commercial Powertrain System Analysis
   Toolkit (PSAT) software and the other proposed methodology by the
   authors based on a linear time-varying MPC.}},

Abstract = {{Using first-principles total energy calculations, we investigate the
   structural stability and electronic properties of Re3ZnNx (x = 0, 0.25,
   0.5, 1) and Re3ZnX (X = H, B, C, and O) compounds. The calculations
   indicated that interstitial atoms including N, H, B, C, and O, always
   prefer the octahedral sites to the tetrahedral sites in the studied
   hexagonal structure, in good agreement with the experimental results.
   However, the calculated heat of formation and elastic properties suggest
   that the incorporation of nitrogen is not favorable for the formation of
   the Re-Zn alloy, but high pressure and high temperature lower the energy
   barrier to facilitate the incorporation of N into Re3Zn alloy.
   Furthermore, B addition displays the highest effect in strengthening
   Re-Zn alloy upon the formation of relatively-strong boron-boron bond and
   thus higher shear modulus. Also, the ductile character of these alloys
   is important for possible applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a wheel-terrain interaction model, which enables
   efficient modeling of wheeled locomotion in soft soil and numerical
   simulations of off-road mobile robots. This modular model is derived
   based on wheel kinematics and terramechanics and the main focus is on
   describing the stress distributions along the wheel-terrain interface
   and the reaction forces exerted on the wheel by the soil. When the
   wheels are steered, the shear stresses underneath the wheel were modeled
   based on isotropic assumptions. The forces and torques contributed by
   the bulldozing effect of the side surfaces is also considered in the
   proposed model. Furthermore, the influence of grousers, commonly used on
   smaller mobile robots, was modeled by (1) averaging the normal pressures
   contributed by the grousers and the wheel concave portion, and (2)
   assuming that the shear phenomenon takes places along the grouser tips.
   By integrating the model with multibody system code for vehicle
   dynamics, simulation studies of various off-road conditions in
   three-dimensional environments can be conducted. The model was verified
   by using field experiment data, both for a single-wheel vehicle and a
   whole vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{Cavitation memory effects occur when remnants of cavitation bubbles (
   nuclei) persist in the host medium and act as seeds for subsequent
   events. In pulsed cavitational ultrasound therapy, or histotripsy, this
   effect may cause cavitation to repeatedly occur at these seeded
   locations within a target volume, producing inhomogeneous tissue
   fractionation or requiring an excess number of pulses to completely
   homogenize the target volume. We hypothesized that by removing the
   cavitation memory, i.e., the persistent nuclei, the cavitation bubbles
   could be induced at random locations in response to each pulse;
   therefore, complete disruption of a tissue volume may be achieved with
   fewer pulses. To test the hypothesis, the cavitation memory was
   passively removed by increasing the intervals between successive pulses,
   Delta t, from 2, 10, 20, 50 and 100, to 200 ms. Histotripsy treatments
   were performed in red blood cell tissue phantoms and ex vivo livers
   using 1-MHz ultrasound pulses of 10 cycles at P-/P+ pressure of 21/59
   MPa. The phantom study allowed for direct visualization of the
   cavitation patterns and the lesion development process in real time
   using high-speed photography; the ex vivo tissue study provided
   validation of the memory effect in real tissues. Results of the phantom
   study showed an exponential decrease in the correlation coefficient
   between cavitation patterns in successive pulses from 0.5 +/- 0.1 to 0.1
   +/- 0.1 as Delta t increased from 2-200 ms; correspondingly, the lesion
   was completely fractionated with significantly fewer pulses for longer
   Delta ts. In the tissue study, given the same number of therapy pulses,
   complete and homogeneous tissue fractionation with well-defined lesion
   boundaries was achieved only for Delta t >= 100 ms. These results
   indicated that the removal of the cavitation memory resulted in more
   efficient treatments and homogeneous lesions. (E-mail: tzuyin@umich.edu)

Abstract = {{The paper studies the capacities of time hopping ultra wideband (TH-UWB)
   systems by adopting orthogonal pulse-based modulation schemes in a
   multipath environment with the consideration of multiple access
   interference (MAI) and inter symbol interference (ISI). Recently,
   orthogonal pulse-based modulation schemes such as pulse shape modulation
   (PSM), biorthogonal PSM (BPSM) and the combination of orthogonal pulse
   position modulation (OPPM) and BPSM have been proposed for UWB system to
   reduce ISI and MAI. In this paper, we first investigate the influences
   of ISI and MAI on the capacities of TH-UWB systems in terms of
   signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) for high-order modulation
   schemes based on various sets of orthogonal pulses. How mutual
   information varies with the number of multipath components (MPCs) is
   then analyzed. The complete mathematical analysis and simulation results
   are provided in detail. When maximizing the mutual information, the
   Gaussian distribution approximate is assumed to describe the
   characteristics of MAI and ISI. Simulation results are provided to
   verify the theoretical analysis. Some conclusions are drawn thereafter,
   such as that capacity depends on the pulse patterns adopted and mutual
   information varies with inversely proportional to the number of MPCs. We
   also observed that the capacities of UWB systems for OPPM-BPSM schemes
   are larger than those of PSM and BPSM schemes.}},

Abstract = {{A novel cavity-backed coplanar waveguide (CBCPW) to rectangular
   waveguide transition having a 2.5D geometry compatible with
   micromachining fabrication technique is presented. This transition makes
   use of a short-circuited pin (as opposed to a suspended probe) in
   conjunction with resonant sections of CPW line over the broad wall of a
   reduced height waveguide segment to facilitate impedance matching.
   Although the bandwidth of this transition is smaller than the standard
   suspended probe transitions, its fabrication at submillimeter-wave and
   terahertz bands is rather straightforward and does not require assembly
   of many small parts with very high precision. The design procedure
   starts from an equivalent circuit model which is then fine-tuned using a
   full-wave approach. A silicon micromachining process for the fabrication
   of the proposed transition is presented. To validate the design and
   demonstrate the feasibility of the fabrication process, a prototype
   transition operating at 240 GHz is fabricated and tested. It is shown
   that a back-to-back transition prototype at 240 GHz provides less than 1
   dB of insertion loss over more that 17\% fractional bandwidth. It is
   also shown that the measured S-parameters of the back-to-back transition
   are in good agreement with the simulation results. The microfabrication
   process and associated tolerances allows for scaling the dimensions and
   frequency of operation to THz frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a single-face, membrane-supported,
   miniaturized-element frequency selective surface (MEFSS) for image
   rejection of a J-band upconvertor mixer. In this design, a new
   miniaturized-element patch-wire MEFSS configuration is proposed to
   select the upper-side band (USB) response of a wave radiated from an
   upconvertor. The proposed MEFSS produces a single pole and an adjacent
   transmission zero to suppress the lower sideband. It is shown that the
   frequency response of this MEFSS can be predicted by an equivalent
   circuit model and that the location of pole and zero can be tuned
   independently with physical parameters. MEFSS elements are supported and
   protected by a 10 m thick low-loss polymer membrane which allows
   flexible handling and minimizes substrate losses. Thickness of the
   metallic traces is increased to reduce the conductor loss. A salient
   feature of this design is low sensitivity of its frequency response to
   the angle of incidence and the absence of a harmonic response. This
   feature allows placement of the spatial filter in close proximity to
   radiating elements with spherical wavefronts. The membrane-supported
   MEFSS is fabricated using a microfabrication method with tolerances that
   allow such filter implementations up to terahertz frequencies.
   Performance of the fabricated device is experimentally verified using a
   free-space measurement setup. Experimental results show that the
   transmission response has 0.6 dB insertion loss in the passband (221-223
   GHz) and more than 25 dB rejection out-of-band (206-208 GHz) which is in
   good agreement with full-wave simulation and its circuit model
   prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Devices utilizing spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) effect in the
   terahertz (THz) domain has attracted increasing attention because such
   devices can be potentially used in fast signal processing and storages.
   In this paper, we present a comprehensive mathematical model of the
   doubly corrugated SSPP (DC-SSPP) structure derived from full-field
   analysis. Based on the proposed model, a complete characterization of
   the structure is carried out and properties such as dispersion
   relationships and S-parameters are obtained. The results show the
   existence of slow light modes in the DC-SSPP structure. Discrete
   sub-wavelength transmission bands, and sometimes sharp transmission
   peaks with strong EM field localization can also be achieved under
   certain device designs. They are compared with the simulation results
   obtained from the CST software package developed by Computer Simulation
   Technology AG. The validation as well as limitations of the derived
   results is also discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{We previously reported the development of a simple, user-friendly, and
   versatile 384 hanging drop array plate for 3D spheroid culture and the
   importance of utilizing 3D cellular models in anti-cancer drug
   sensitivity testing. The 384 hanging drop array plate allows for
   high-throughput capabilities and offers significant improvements over
   existing 3D spheroid culture methods. To allow for practical 3D
   cell-based high-throughput screening and enable broader use of the
   plate, we characterize the robustness of the 384 hanging drop array
   plate in terms of assay performance and demonstrate the versatility of
   the plate. We find that the 384 hanging drop array plate performance is
   robust in fluorescence- and colorimetric-based assays through Z-factor
   calculations. Finally, we demonstrate different plate capabilities and
   applications, including: spheroid transfer and retrieval for Janus
   spheroid formation, sequential addition of cells for concentric layer
   patterning of different cell types, and culture of a wide variety of

Abstract = {{Our goal is to develop a model capable to discern the response of a
   watershed to different erosion mechanisms. We propose a framework that
   integrates a geomorphic component into the physically-based and
   spatially distributed TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator
   (tRIBS) model. The coupled model simulates main erosive processes of
   hillslopes (raindrop impact detachment, overland flow entrainment, and
   diffusive processes) and channel (erosion and deposition due to the
   action of water flow). In addition to the spatially distributed, dynamic
   hydrologic variables, the model computes the sediment transport
   discharge and changes in elevation, which feedback to hydrological
   dynamics through local changes of terrain slope, aspect, and drainage
   network configuration. The model was calibrated for the Lucky Hills
   basin, a semi-arid watershed nested in the Walnut Gulch Experimental
   Watershed (Arizona, USA). It is demonstrated to be capable of
   reproducing main runoff and sediment yield events and accumulated
   volumes over the long term. The model was also used to study the
   response of two first-order synthetic basins representative of landforms
   dominated by fluvial and diffusive erosion processes to a 100-year long
   stationary climate. The analysis of the resultant slope-contributing
   area relationships for the two synthetic basins illustrates that the
   model is consistent with assumed principles of behavior and capable of
   reproducing the main mechanisms of erosion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{184}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{166-177}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{A 2 wt.\% Ag/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst was studied for the ethanol selective
   catalytic reduction of NOx from 200 to 550 degrees C and space
   velocities between 30,000 h(-1) and 140,000 h(-1). Peak NOx conversions
   reached 85\% at 400 degrees C, and an activation energy was determined
   to be 57 kJ/mol with a feed of ethanol to NOx or HC1/NOx = 3. Up to 80\%
   of the NO is oxidized to NO2 at 250 degrees C, but overall NOx
   conversion is only 15\%. Interestingly, ethanol oxidation occurs at much
   lower temperatures than NOx reduction; at 250 degrees C, ethanol
   oxidation is 80\% when flowing ethanol + NO + O-2. This increased
   reactivity, compared to only 15\% when flowing only ethanol + O-2,
   combined with the observation that NO is not oxidized to NO2 in the
   absence of ethanol illustrates a synergistic relationship between the
   reactants.
   To further investigate this chemistry, a series of DRIFTS experiments
   were performed. To form nitrates/nitrites on the catalysts it was
   necessary to include ethanol in the feed with NO. These
   nitrates/nitrites were readily formed when flowing NO2 over the
   catalyst. It is proposed that ethanol adsorbs through an
   ethoxy-intermediate that results in atomic hydrogen on the surface. This
   hydrogen aids the release of NO2 from Ag to the gas-phase which, can be
   subsequently adsorbed at gamma-Al2O3 sites away from Ag. The
   disappearance of these nitrates/nitrites at higher temperatures proceeds
   in parallel with the increase in NOx reduction reactivity between 300
   and 350 degrees C observed in the kinetic study. It is therefore
   proposed that the consumption of nitrates is involved in the rate
   determining step for this reaction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) have been broadly used for
   constructing tissue-engineered blood vessels. However, the availability
   of mature SMCs from donors or patients is very limited. Derivation of
   SMCs by differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has been reported,
   but not widely utilized in vascular tissue engineering due to low
   induction efficiency and, hence, low SMC purity. To address these
   problems, SMCs were enriched from retinoic acid induced mouse ESCs with
   LacZ genetic labeling under the control of SM22 alpha promoter as the
   positive sorting marker in the present study. The sorted SMCs were
   characterized and then cultured on three-dimensional macro-porous
   nano-fibrous scaffolds in vitro or implanted subcutaneously into nude
   mice after being seeded on the scaffolds. Our data showed that the LacZ
   staining, which reflected the corresponding SMC marker SM22 alpha
   expression level, was efficient as a positive selection marker to
   dramatically enrich SMCs and eliminate other cell types. After the
   sorted cells were seeded into the three-dimensional nano-fibrous
   scaffolds, continuous retinoic acid treatment further enhanced the SMC
   marker gene expression level while inhibited pluripotent maker gene
   expression level during the in vitro culture. Meanwhile, after being
   implanted subcutaneously into nude mice, the implanted cells maintained
   the positive LacZ staining within the constructs and no teratoma
   formation was observed. In conclusion, our results demonstrated the
   potential of SMCs derived from ESCs as a promising cell source for
   therapeutic vascular tissue engineering and disease model applications.}},

   size, NPs will preferentially reside within edge dislocations, defects,
   which enable the formation of surface structures, islands or holes, in
   BCP thin films. The islands (and holes), ubiquitous in BCP thin films,
   coarsen in a manner reminiscent of 2-dimensional phase ordering systems
   of binary alloys, where the growth is self-similar, governed by
   classical capillarity driven Ostwald ripening and coalescence
   mechanisms. In the pure BCP thin films, coarsening initially occurs via
   coalescence and at later times via Ostwald ripening. In BCP/nanoparticle
   systems, the dynamics are considerably slower, and throughout similar
   time scales, the mechanism of coarsening occurs predominantly via
   coalescence. Contributions to the structural evolution due to Ostwald
   ripening are comparatively small over these time scales. Our assessments
   are based on an analysis of the power law growth exponents and of
   probability density distribution functions of data obtained from samples
   using microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{We present molecular dynamics (MD) and slip-springs model simulations of
   the chain segmental dynamics in entangled linear polymer melts. The
   time-dependent behavior of the segmental orientation autocorrelation
   functions and mean-square segmental displacements are analyzed for both
   flexible and semiflexible chains, with particular attention paid to the
   scaling relations among these dynamic quantities. Effective combination
   of the two simulation methods at different coarse-graining levels allows
   us to explore the chain dynamics for chain lengths ranging from Z
   approximate to 2 to 90 entanglements. For a given chain length of Z
   approximate to 15, the time scales accessed span for more than 10
   decades, covering all of the interesting relaxation regimes. The
   obtained time dependence of the monomer mean square displacements, kW,
   is in good agreement with the tube theory predictions. Results on the
   first- and second-order segmental orientation autocorrelation functions,
   C-1(t) and C-2(t), demonstrate a clear power law relationship of C-2(t)
   similar to C-1(t)(m) with m = 3, 2, and 1 in the initial, free Rouse,
   and entangled (constrained Rouse) regimes, respectively. The
   return-to-origin hypothesis, which leads to inverse proportionality
   between the segmental orientation autocorrelation functions and g(1)(t)
   in the entangled regime, is convincingly verified by the simulation
   result of C-1(t) proportional to g(1)(t)(-1) proportional to t(-1/4) in
   the constrained Rouse regime, where for well-entangled chains both
   C-1(t) and g(1)(t) are rather insensitive to the constraint release
   effects. However, the second-order correlation function, C-2(t), shows
   much stronger sensitivity to the constraint release effects and
   experiences a protracted crossover from the free Rouse to entangled
   regime. This crossover region extends for at least one decade in time
   longer than that of C-1(t). The predicted time scaling behavior of
   C-2(t) proportional to t(-1/4) is observed in slip-springs simulations
   only at chain length of 90 entanglements, whereas shorter chains show
   higher scaling exponents. The reported simulation work can be applied to
   understand the observations of the NMR experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the exciton binding energies of several pure
   organic dyes and their chemical structures is explored using density
   functional theory calculations in order to optimize the molecular design
   in terms of the light-to-electric energy-conversion efficiency in
   dye-sensitized solar cell devices. Comparing calculations with
   measurements reveals that the exciton binding energy and quantum yield
   are inversely correlated, implying that dyes with lower exciton binding
   energy produce electric current from the absorbed photons more
   efficiently. When a strong electron-accepting moiety is inserted in the
   middle of the dye framework, the light-to-electric energy-conversion
   behavior significantly deteriorates. As verified by electronic-structure
   calculations, this is likely due to electron localization near the
   electron-deficient group. The combined computational and experimental
   design approach provides insight into the functioning of organic
   photosensitizing dyes for solar-cell applications. This is exemplified
   by the development of a novel, all-organic dye (EB-01) exhibiting a
   power conversion efficiency of over 9\%.}},

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{January 2009 saw the successful launch of the first space-based mission
   specifically designed for measuring greenhouse gases, the Japanese
   Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). We present global land
   maps (Level 3 data) of column-averaged CO2 concentrations (X-CO2)
   derived using observations from the GOSAT ACOS retrieval algorithm, for
   July through December 2009. The applied geostatistical mapping approach
   makes it possible to generate maps at high spatial and temporal
   resolutions that include uncertainty measures and that are derived
   directly from the Level 2 observations, without invoking an atmospheric
   transport model or estimates of CO2 uptake and emissions. As such, they
   are particularly well suited for comparison studies. Results show that
   the Level 3 maps for July to December 2009 on a 1 degrees x 1.25 degrees
   grid, at six-day resolution capture much of the synoptic scale and
   regional variability of X-CO2, in addition to its overall seasonality.
   The uncertainty estimates, which reflect local data coverage, X-CO2
   variability, and retrieval errors, indicate that the Southern latitudes
   are relatively well-constrained, while the Sahara Desert and the high
   Northern latitudes are weakly-constrained. A probabilistic comparison to
   the PCTM/GEOS-5/CASA-GFED model reveals that the most statistically
   significant discrepancies occur in South America in July and August, and
   central Asia in September to December. While still preliminary, these
   results illustrate the usefulness of a high spatiotemporal resolution,
   data-driven Level 3 data product for direct interpretation and
   comparison of satellite observations of highly dynamic parameters such
   as atmospheric CO2. Citation: Hammerling, D. M., A. M. Michalak, C.

Abstract = {{The phonon-assisted interband optical absorption spectrum of silicon is

   in very good agreement with experimental measurements for a range of
   temperatures. Moreover, our method can accurately determine the optical
   absorption spectrum of silicon in the visible range, an important
   process for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications that cannot be
   addressed with simple models. The computational formalism is quite
   general and can be used to understand the phonon-assisted absorption

Abstract = {{Understanding the interfacial dynamics and fluid physics associated with
   the operation of spacecraft is important for scientific as well as
   engineering purposes. To help address the issues associated with moving
   boundaries, interfacial dynamics, and spatial-temporal variations in
   time and length scales, a 3-D adaptive EulerianLagrangian method is
   extended and further developed. The stationary (Eulerian) Cartesian grid
   is adopted to resolve the fluid flow, and the marker-based triangulated
   moving (Lagrangian) surface meshes are utilized to treat the phase
   boundary. The key concepts and numerical procedures, along with the
   selected interfacial flow problems are presented. Specifically, the
   liquid fuel draining dynamics in different flow regimes, and the liquid
   surface stability under vertically oscillating gravitational
   acceleration are investigated. Direct assessment of experimental
   measurement and scaling analysis is made to highlight the computational
   performance of the present approach as well as the key fluid physics
   influenced by the given flow parameters. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley

Title = {{Modeling Adaptive Regulatory T-Cell Dynamics during Early HIV Infection}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are a subset of CD4(+) T-cells that have been
   found to suppress the immune response. During HIV viral infection, Treg
   activity has been observed to have both beneficial and deleterious
   effects on patient recovery; however, the extent to which this is
   regulated is poorly understood. We hypothesize that this dichotomy in
   behavior is attributed to Treg dynamics changing over the course of
   infection through the proliferation of an `adaptive' Treg population
   which targets HIV-specific immune responses. To investigate the role
   Tregs play in HIV infection, a delay differatial equation model was
   constructed to examine (1) the possible existence of two distinct Treg
   populations, normal (nTregs) and adaptive (aTregs), and (2) their
   respective effects in limiting viral load. Sensitivity analysis was
   performed to test parameter regimes that show the proportionality of
   viral load with adaptive regulatory populations and also gave insight
   into the importance of downregulation of CD4(+) cells by normal Tregs on
   viral loads. Through the inclusion of Treg populations in the model, a
   diverse array of viral dynamics was found. Specifically, oscillatory and
   steady state behaviors were both witnessed and it was seen that the
   model provided a more accurate depiction of the effector cell population
   as compared with previous models. Through further studies of adaptive
   and normal Tregs, improved treatments for HIV can be constructed for
   patients and the viral mechanisms of infection can be further
   elucidated.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{218}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{382-391}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Owing to its theoretical as well as practical significance, the facility
   layout problem with unequal-area departments has been studied for
   several decades, with a wide range of heuristic and a few exact solution
   procedures developed by numerous researchers. In one of the exact
   procedures, the facility layout problem is formulated as a mixed-integer
   programming (MIP) model in which binary (0/1) variables are used to
   prevent departments from overlapping with one another. Obtaining an
   optimal solution to the MIP model is difficult, and currently only
   problems with a limited number of departments can be solved to
   optimality. Motivated by this situation, we developed a heuristic
   procedure which uses a ``graph pair{''} to determine and manipulate the
   relative location of the departments in the layout. The graph-pair
   representation technique essentially eliminates the binary variables in
   the MIP model, which allows the heuristic to solve a large number of
   linear programming models to construct and improve the layout in a
   comparatively short period of time. The search procedure to improve the
   layout is driven by a simulated annealing algorithm. The effectiveness
   of the proposed graph-pair heuristic is demonstrated by comparing the
   results with those reported in recent papers. Possible extensions to the
   graph-pair representation technique are discussed at the end of the
   paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Proposing a good exit scenario can make great contributions to improving
   road conditions. The influence of two exit scenarios, which depend on
   the dynamic behavior of the last vehicle (that closest to the exit), on
   the route flux, vehicle number, and speed by using two feedback
   strategies with different arrival rates (V-p) was studied. We find that
   the weight of the route is dynamic instead of static, which depends on
   the real route conditions. In our case study, we find that the flux
   threshold value with respect to the necessity of applying information
   feedback strategy is 0.32 (which corresponds to V-p approximate to
   0.65). Further, we illustrate the velocity distribution plots of each
   route, which provide us with most of the important information we need,
   when adopting different feedback strategies and exit scenarios with two
   arrival rates (V-p). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   electron density occur in response to strong ionospheric flows or plasma
   density gradients during geomagnetic disturbances and are considered a
   space weather concern due to disruption to communication and navigation
   signals. The RAX CubeSat was launched in November 2010 and conducted a
   single experiment in coordination with the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter
   Radar. Due to geophysical inactivity, e. g., lack of strong ionospheric
   electric fields and low ionospheric densities, no FAI were expected or
   observed. However, the radar receiver payload operation was successfully
   demonstrated, including the capability to sense signals as low as -110
   dBm, the capability of transmitter-receiver synchronization and accurate
   ranging, processing of 1.2 GB of raw radar data on board in less than 1
   hour, and the downlink of the science results within three-four passes.
   Analysis of the payload data shows that the noise level is sufficiently
   low. Although the interference level is a concern, it does not appear to
   significantly limit the measurements. Toward the end of December 2010,
   the solar power system gradually degraded and the mission terminated in
   early February 2011 after prolonged loss of contact with the satellite.
   Meanwhile, RAX II was launched in October 2011 to a polar orbit. This
   paper describes the RAX science and radar system and presents the
   results from the first experiment conducted.}},

   band inversion. Parametrized ``scissors operators{''} derived from the
   bulk studies are then used to investigate the electronic structure of
   slab models which exhibit topologically protected surface states. The
   introduction of self-energy corrections results in significant shifts of
   the surface-state Dirac point energies relative to the bulk bands and in
   enlarged gap openings from the interactions between the surface states
   across the thin slab, both in agreement with experimental data.}},

   CORONAL HOLES}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{749}},

Abstract = {{Coronal holes are the source regions of the fast solar wind, which fills
   most of the solar system volume near the cycle minimum. Removing stray
   light from extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images of the Sun's corona is of
   high astrophysical importance, as it is required to make meaningful
   determinations of temperatures and densities of coronal holes. EUV
   images tend to be dominated by the component of the stray light due to
   the long-range scatter caused by the microroughness of telescope mirror
   surfaces, and this component has proven very difficult to measure in
   pre-flight characterization. In-flight characterization heretofore has
   proven elusive due to the fact that the detected image is simultaneously
   nonlinear in two unknown functions: the stray light pattern and the true
   image that would be seen by an ideal telescope. Using a constrained
   blind deconvolution technique that takes advantage of known zeros in the
   true image provided by a fortuitous lunar transit, we have removed the
   stray light from solar images seen by the EUVI instrument on STEREO-B in
   all four filter bands (171, 195, 284, and 304 angstrom). Uncertainty
   measures of the stray light corrected images, which include the
   systematic error due to misestimation of the scatter, are provided. It
   is shown that in EUVI, stray light contributes up to 70\% of the
   emission in coronal holes seen on the solar disk, which has dramatic
   consequences for diagnostics of temperature and density and therefore
   estimates of key plasma parameters such as the plasma beta and
   ion-electron collision rates.}},

   project two simultaneous images onto a single image sensor. A novel PTV
   algorithm relying on the similarity of the particle images corresponding
   to a single, physical particle produces 3-component, volumetric velocity
   fields, rather than the 3-component, planar results obtained with
   stereoscopic PIV, and without the reconstruction of an instantaneous 3D

   spacing affected the quantum dot size and the fidelity of the quantum
   dots with respect to the lateral patterns. 100\% pattern fidelity was
   retained after six layers of dots for a 9.0 ms focused ion beam dwell
   time and 2.0 mu m lateral pattern spacing. Analysis of the change in
   quantum dot size as a function of pattern spacing provided a means of
   estimating the maximum average adatom surface diffusion length to be
   approximately 500 nm, and demonstrated the ability to alter the wetting
   layer thickness via pattern spacing. Increasing the number of layers
   from six to 26 resulted in mound formation, which destroyed the pattern
   fidelity at close pattern spacings and led to a bimodal quantum dot size
   distribution as measured by atomic force microscopy. The bimodal size
   distribution also affected the optical properties of the dots, causing a
   split quantum dot photoluminescence peak where the separation between
   the split peaks increased with increasing pattern spacing.}},

   employing two different mechanical models based on the Reissner and
   elastic membrane theories. We found that the relatively soft

   Furthermore, we show that AFM F-Delta curves in combination with a
   suitable mechanical model can assess the shell properties of
   phospholipid MBs. The ``effective{''} Young's modulus of the whole

Abstract = {{We developed novel flow-through surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
   platforms using gold nanoparticle (Au-NP) immobilized multihole
   capillaries for rapid and sensitive vapor detection. The multihole
   capillaries consisting of thousands of micrometer-sized flow-through
   channels provide many unique characteristics for vapor detection. Most
   importantly, its three-dimensional SERS-active micro-/nanostructures
   make available multilayered assembly of Au-NPs, which greatly increase
   SERS-active surface area within a focal volume of excitation and
   collection, thus improving the detection sensitivity. In addition, the
   multihole capillary's inherent longitudinal channels offer rapid and
   convenient vapor delivery, yet its micrometer-sized holes increase the
   interaction between vapor molecules and SERS-active substrate.
   Experimentally, rapid pyridine vapor detection (within 1 s of exposure)
   and ultrasensitive 4-nitrophenol vapor detection (at a sub-ppb level)
   were successfully achieved in open air at room temperature. Such an
   ultrasensitive SEAS platform enabled, for the first time, the
   investigation of both pyridine and 4-nitrophenol vapor adsorption

Abstract = {{Background-High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been introduced
   for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias because it offers the ability to
   create rapid tissue modification in confined volumes without directly
   contacting the myocardium. In spite of the benefits of HIFU, a number of
   limitations have been reported, which hindered its clinical adoption.
   Methods and Results-In this study, we used a multimodal approach to
   evaluate thermal and nonthermal effects of HIFU in cardiac ablation. We
   designed a computer controlled system capable of simultaneous
   fluorescence mapping and HIFU ablation. Using this system, linear
   lesions were created in isolated rabbit atria (n=6), and point lesions
   were created in the ventricles of whole-heart (n=6) preparations by
   applying HIFU at clinical doses (4-16 W). Additionally, we evaluate the
   gap size in ablation lines necessary for conduction in atrial
   preparations (n=4). The voltage sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS was used to
   assess functional damage produced by HIFU. Optical coherence tomography
   and general histology were used to evaluate lesion extent. Conduction
   block was achieved in 1 (17\%) of 6 atrial preparations with a single
   ablation line. Following 10 minutes of rest, 0 (0\%) of 6 atrial
   preparations demonstrated sustained conduction block from a single
   ablation line. Tissue displacement of 1 to 3 mm was observed during HIFU
   application due to acoustic radiation force along the lesion line.
   Additionally, excessive acoustic pressure and high temperature from HIFU
   generated cavitation, causing macroscopic tissue damage. A minimum gap
   size of 1.5 mm was found to conduct electric activity.
   Conclusions-This study identified 3 potential mechanisms responsible for
   the failure of HIFU ablation in cardiac tissues. Both acoustic radiation
   force and acoustic cavitation, in conjunction with inconsistent thermal
   deposition, can increase the risk of lesion discontinuity and result in
   gap sizes that promote ablation failure. (Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol.

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{It is shown that the vector potential and the scalar potential satisfy a
   Buneman-Hartree like (BHL) condition and a Hull-cutoff like (HCL)
   condition everywhere within the Brillouin flow of a cylindrical,
   relativistic magnetron, when the phase velocity in the Buneman-Hartree
   condition is replaced by the laminar, local flow velocity of the
   Brillouin flow. The vector potential and the scalar potentials include
   the Brillouin flow's self magnetic field and the self electric fields.
   The HCL condition reduces to the conventional Hull cutoff condition
   derived from single particle orbit theory when the Brillouin hub extends
   to the anode. However, the BHL condition reduces to the conventional
   Buneman-Hartree condition only in the planar magnetron limit but may be
   substantially different for a cylindrical magnetron, as demonstrated
   recently {[}Lau et al., Phys. Plasmas 17, 033102 (2010)]. These
   conclusions apply also to the inverted magnetron configuration. The
   effects of ions are discussed. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We present a novel approach for quantifying the channel size
   distribution (CSD) of complex three-dimensional microstructures. The
   CSD, which characterizes the probability of finding a channel bottleneck
   with a given size, is difficult to measure for materials with complex
   microstructures that are extensively interconnected. More importantly,
   insights about the physical properties of these materials, such as
   transport properties, may be provided by their CSD. The CSD is measured
   by topological characterization of a distance function, which is
   calculated from complex microstructural data using the level set method.
   The newly developed method for calculating CSD is shown to be robust
   such that it is applicable to both smooth and discontinuous (bi-level)
   data. The method is demonstrated by calculating the CSDs for
   three-dimensional microstructures formed through conserved
   (Cahn-Hilliard) and nonconserved (Allen-Cahn) dynamics. We found
   significant differences between the two structures in their
   characteristic channel size and the width of their distributions, even
   though their genera, a measure of connectivity, are almost identical.
   The CSD, which was not previously available for complex microstructures,
   will provide a new means to correlate properties of composite materials
   with their performance. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of Acta

Abstract = {{The fatigue behavior of the nickel-base superalloy Rene 88 DT has been
   investigated at room temperature with fully reversed loading in an
   ultrasonic fatigue apparatus operating at a frequency close to 20 kHz. A
   characterization protocol based on the electron backscatter diffraction
   technique has been developed to identify the combination of
   microstructural features within crack initiation sites and surrounding
   neighborhoods that leads to the transition from initiation to early
   small crack growth. Surface grains that were more than three times the
   average grain size, that were favorably oriented for cyclic slip
   localization and that also contained Sigma 3 twin boundaries inclined to
   the loading axis were most favorable for fatigue crack initiation.
   Fatigue cracks subsequently grew in grain clusters within which grains
   are misoriented by less than 20 degrees relative to the initiation
   grains. More highly misoriented neighboring grains resulted in crack
   arrest. The material characteristics that promote crack initiation and
   small crack growth exist only at the extreme tails of the
   microstructural distributions. The implications for modeling of fatigue
   life and fatigue life variability are discussed. (C) 2012 Acta

Abstract = {{Extraction of effective information from measured vibration signals is a
   fundamental task for the machinery condition monitoring and fault
   diagnosis. As a typical blind source separation (BSS) method,
   independent component analysis (ICA) is known to be able to effectively
   extract the latent information in complex signals even when the mixing
   mode and sources are unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
   to overcome two major drawbacks of the traditional ICA algorithm: lack
   of robustness and source contribution evaluation. The enhanced ICA
   algorithm is established to escalate the separation performance and
   robustness of ICA algorithm. This algorithm repeatedly separates the
   mixed signals multiple times with different initial parameters and
   evaluates the optimal separated components by the clustering evaluation
   method. Furthermore, the source contributions to the mixed signals can
   also be evaluated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
   through the numerical simulation and experiment studies.

Abstract = {{This study investigates the workpiece temperature in minimum quantity
   lubrication (MQL) deep hole drilling. An inverse heat transfer method is
   developed to estimate the spatial and temporal change of heat flux on
   the drilled hole wall surfaces based on the workpiece temperature
   measured using embedded thermocouples and analyzed using the finite
   element method. The inverse method is validated experimentally in both
   dry and MQL deep-hole drilling conditions and the results show good
   agreement with the experimental temperature measurements. This study
   demonstrates that the heat generated on the hole wall surface is
   significant in deep hole drilling. In the example of deep hole drilling
   of ductile iron, the level of thermal power applied on the hole wall
   surface is about the same as that on the hole bottom surface when a 10
   mm drill reached a depth of 120 mm. {[}DOI:10.1115/1.4005794]}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Percolation on a one-dimensional lattice and fractals, such as the
   Sierpinski gasket, is typically considered to be trivial, because they
   percolate only at full bond density. By dressing up such lattices with
   small-world bonds, a novel percolation transition with explosive cluster
   growth can emerge at a non-trivial critical point. There, the usual
   order parameter, describing the probability of any node to be part of
   the largest cluster, jumps instantly to a finite value. Here we provide
   a simple example in the form of a small-world network consisting of a
   one-dimensional lattice which, when combined with a hierarchy of
   long-range bonds, reveals many features of this transition in a
   mathematically rigorous manner.}},

Abstract = {{An important challenge in the field of electrorheology is identifying
   low-viscosity fluids that would exhibit significant changes in
   viscosity, or a yield stress, upon the application of an external
   electric field. Our recent research showed that optimal compositions of
   mixtures, 10 wt \% sulfonated polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes
   (s-POSS) mixed with polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS), exhibited significant
   electrorheological activity. Here we show that s-POSS/PDMS mixtures
   containing polystyrene (PS) fillers, of micrometer-sized dimensions,
   containing as little as similar to 1 wt \% s-POSS, exhibited an increase
   in ER activity by an order of magnitude, beyond that of s-POSS/PDMS
   mixtures. The dynamic yield stress was found to scale with the particle
   diameter, a, as tau(y) proportional to a(0.5) and with the electric
   field as tau(y) proportional to E1.5-2.5; this behavior is reasonably
   well understood within the context of dielectric electrorheological
   theory.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time single- and multiple-axis vibrotactile feedback of trunk
   motion has been shown to significantly decrease mean trunk tilt and
   decrease time spent outside a no vibrotactile feedback zone (dead zone)
   in older adults within a laboratory setting. This study aimed to
   determine if these improvements can translate into everyday use, during
   which other tasks may simultaneously demand attention. A dual-task
   paradigm was used in which 10 community-dwelling older adults were asked
   to perform standing trials in the presence of a secondary task (verbal
   or push-button), vibrotactile feedback, or both (dual-task). Results
   show that subjects significantly increased the percentage of time inside
   the dead zone when feedback was provided compared to when it was not
   during both verbal (+13.6\%) and push-button (+10.1\%) secondary tasks.
   Providing feedback also decreased RMS of trunk tilt during both
   secondary tasks (verbal: -0.129 degrees; push-button: -0.138 degrees).
   However, response times for secondary tasks increased (verbal: +119 ms;
   push-button: +110 ms) when feedback was provided. These results suggest
   that while vibrotactile feedback does increase attentional load in older
   adults, it can still be used effectively to improve postural metrics in
   high cognitive load situations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The low thermal conductivity of the prototype hydrogen storage
   adsorbent, metal-organic framework 5 (MOF-5), can limit performance in
   applications requiring rapid gas uptake and release, such as in hydrogen
   storage for fuel cell vehicles. As a means to improve thermal
   conductivity, we have synthesized MOF-5-based composites containing 1-10
   wt.\% of expanded natural graphite (ENG) and evaluated their properties.
   Cylindrical pellets of neat MOF-5 and MOF-5/ENG composites with
   densities of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 g/cm(3) are prepared and assessed with
   regard to thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, surface area,
   and crystallinity. For pellets of density 0.5 g/cm(3), we find that ENG
   additions of 10 wt.\% result in a factor of five improvement in thermal
   conductivity relative to neat MOF-5, increasing from 0.10 to 0.56 W/mK
   at room temperature. Based on the relatively higher densities, surface
   areas, and enhanced crystallinity exhibited by the composites, ENG
   additions appear to partially protect MOF-5 crystallites from plastic
   deformation and/or amorphization during mechanical compaction; this
   suggests that thermal conductivity can be improved while maintaining the
   favorable hydrogen storage properties of this material. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Synthetic time reversal (STR) is a technique for blind deconvolution in
   an unknown multipath environment that relies on generic features (rays
   or modes) of multipath sound propagation. This paper describes how
   ray-based STR signal estimates may be improved and how ray-based STR
   sound-channel impulse-response estimates may be exploited for
   approximate source localization in underwater environments. Findings are
   based on simulations and underwater experiments involving source-array
   ranges from 100 m to 1 km in 60 -m-deep water and chirp signals with a
   bandwidth of 1.5-4.0 kHz. Signal estimation performance is quantified by
   the correlation coefficient between the source-broadcast and the
   STR-estimated signals for a variable number N of array elements, 2 <= N
   <= 32, and a range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), -5 dB <= SNR <= 30
   dB. At high SNR, STR-estimated signals are found to have
   cross-correlation coefficients of similar to 90\% with as few as four
   array elements, and similar performance may be achieved at a SNR of
   nearly 0 dB with 32 array elements. When the broadband STR-estimated
   impulse response is used for source localization via a simple ray-based
   backpropagation scheme, the results are less ambiguous than those
   obtained from conventional broadband matched field processing. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The surrogate-based recurrence framework (SBRF) approach to
   reduced-order dynamic stall modeling associated with pitching/plunging
   airfoils subject to fixed or time-varying freestream Mach numbers is
   described. The SBRF is shown to effectively mimic full-order
   two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics solutions for unsteady
   lift, moment, and drag, but at a fraction of the computational cost. In
   addition to accounting for realistic helicopter rotor blade dynamics, it
   is shown that the SBRF can model advancing rotor shock induced
   separation as well as retreating blade stall associated with excessive
   angles of attack. Therefore, the SBRF is ideally suited for a variety of
   rotary-wing aeroelasticity and active/passive design optimization
   studies that require high-fidelity aerodynamic response solutions with

Abstract = {{Studies are described for modeling electron energy phenomena for
   hypersonic flows. The electron energy must be modeled separately from
   other energy modes because it may have a significant effect on
   vibrational relaxation and chemical reactions. Whenever flows are in a
   strong thermal nonequilibrium state, an electron energy equation should
   be considered. In the considered electron energy equation, the electron
   energy relaxations of each energy mode are accounted for, which include
   translational-electron, rotational-electron, and vibrational-electron
   energy relaxation. To avoid a singularity of the Jacobian in the
   electron energy equation, we introduce a modified electron energy
   expression. The suggested electron-energy model is implemented into a
   hypersonic flow code for both explicit and implicit methods. In the
   present study, we numerically simulate the electron energy with
   electron-vibrational relaxation for diatomic nitrogen. For the
   assessment of the electron-energy model, we simulate several cases,
   which are a plasma wind-tunnel, a radio attenuation measurement (RAM)-C
   case, the entry of the automated transfer vehicle, and the Stardust
   reentry capsule.}},

Abstract = {{A new implementation of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method,

   physical models and numerical techniques. Unique features include the
   use of nonuniform Cartesian adaptive subcells, a collision probability
   modification to reduce errors associated with spatial averaging in
   collision probabilities, and automatic planar element approximation of
   analytically defined two- or three-dimensional surface geometries. In
   this work, simulations are performed using both HAP and an established
   DSMC code for a rarefied hypersonic flow of nitrogen over a flat plate,
   and excellent overall agreement is found. Comparisons are also performed
   with available experimental data and published DSMC results for the same
   flat plate flow problem. Additional simulations are employed to
   demonstrate reduced dependence on cell size through a proposed collision
   probability modification. Finally, HAP results are compared with
   published DSMC data for a hypersonic flow over a cylinder, and a
   three-dimensional sphere flow problem is used to demonstrate
   capabilities for automatic generation of planar cut faces over an

Abstract = {{Purpose: In prostate brachytherapy, accurate positioning of the needle
   tip to place radioactive seeds at its target site is critical for
   successful radiation treatment. During the procedure, needle deflection
   leads to seed misplacement and suboptimal radiation dose to cancerous
   cells. In practice, radiation oncologists commonly use high-speed hand
   needle insertion to minimize displacement of the prostate as well as the
   needle deflection. Effects of speed during needle insertion and
   stiffness of trocar (a solid rod inside the hollow cannula) on needle
   deflection are studied.
   Methods: Needle insertion experiments into phantom were performed using
   a 2(2) factorial design (2 parameters at 2 levels), with each condition
   having replicates. Analysis of the deflection data included calculating
   the average, standard deviation, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to
   find significant single and two-way interaction factors.
   Results: The stiffer tungsten carbide trocar is effective in reducing
   the average and standard deviation of needle deflection. The fast
   insertion speed together with the stiffer trocar generated the smallest
   average and standard deviation for needle deflection for almost all
   cases.
   Conclusions: The combination of stiff tungsten carbide trocar and fast
   needle insertion speed are important to decreasing needle deflection.
   The knowledge gained from this study can be used to improve the accuracy
   of needle insertion during brachytherapy procedures. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{A novel and effective method was devised for synthesizing a vertically
   aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) forest on a substrate using waste plastic
   obtained from commercially available water bottles. The advantages of
   the proposed method are the speed of processing and the use of waste as
   a raw material. A mechanism for the CNT growth was also proposed. The
   growth rate of the CNT forest was similar to 2.5 mu mmin(-1).
   Transmission electron microscopy images indicated that the outer
   diameters of the CNTs were 20-30 nm on average. The intensity ratio of
   the G and D Raman bands was 1.27 for the vertically aligned CNT forest.
   The Raman spectrum showed that the wall graphitization of the CNTs,
   synthesized via the proposed method was slightly higher than that of
   commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). We expect
   that the proposed method can be easily adapted to the disposal of other
   refuse materials and applied to MWCNT production industries.}},

   structures undergoing nonlinear and dynamic response, using minimal
   nonlinear response evaluations. The approach uses equivalent loads
   obtained from nonlinear dynamic analysis to perform optimization
   iterations, during the course of which the nonlinear and dynamic system
   is continuously approximated. In this process, the optimization is
   decoupled from the nonlinear dynamic analysis. Results are presented for
   various kinds of nonlinear and dynamic problems showing the

Abstract = {{The skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor is an essential component of the
   excitation-contraction coupling apparatus. Mutations in RYR1 are
   associated with several congenital myopathies (termed RYR1-related
   myopathies) that are the most common non-dystrophic muscle diseases of
   childhood. Currently, no treatments exist for these disorders. Although
   the primary pathogenic abnormality involves defective
   excitation-contraction coupling, other abnormalities likely play a role
   in disease pathogenesis. In an effort to discover novel pathogenic
   mechanisms, we analysed two complementary models of RYR1-related
   myopathies, the relatively relaxed zebrafish and cultured myotubes from
   patients with RYR1-related myopathies. Expression array analysis in the
   zebrafish disclosed significant abnormalities in pathways associated
   with cellular stress. Subsequent studies focused on oxidative stress in
   relatively relaxed zebrafish and RYR1-related myopathy myotubes and
   demonstrated increased oxidant activity, the presence of oxidative
   stress markers, excessive production of oxidants by mitochondria and
   diminished survival under oxidant conditions. Exposure to the
   antioxidant N-acetylcysteine reduced oxidative stress and improved
   survival in the RYR1-related myopathies human myotubes ex vivo and led
   to significant restoration of aspects of muscle function in the
   relatively relaxed zebrafish, thereby confirming its efficacy in vivo.
   We conclude that oxidative stress is an important pathophysiological
   mechanism in RYR1-related myopathies and that N-acetylcysteine is a
   successful treatment modality ex vivo and in a vertebrate disease model.
   We propose that N-acetylcysteine represents the first potential
   therapeutic strategy for these debilitating muscle diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results which were obtained using a split Hopkinson

   were determined from the concentric cylinder model (CCM) in conjunction
   with the geometry of the textile architecture, mechanical properties of
   pure epoxy samples and fiber mechanical properties. The RUC model
   incorporates rate dependent plasticity. Additionally, linear-eigen
   perturbations that correspond to buckling modes are used to seed
   imperfections in the RUC model to capture buckling and subsequent
   failure that was observed in experiments. The RUC model results showed
   good agreement with experiment and correctly captured the observed modes
   of failure while pointing to transitions in failure modes. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{In the present investigation, the axial static crush response of

   crush energy absorption in the filled honeycombs due to a change in the
   deformation mode (in comparison against unfilled honeycombs). Moreover,
   it is seen that the initial failure is a stable collapse unlike the

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{469-478}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In previous works, maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization
   deconvolution for two-interaction events within a single CdZnTe detector
   with dimensions of 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm x 1 cm was implemented. This
   deconvolution method is capable of estimating the source image for each
   energy range as well as the incident spectrum for each direction around
   the detector. To improve the detection efficiency and the image
   resolution, we have built a four-detector array system; each detector
   has dimensions of 2 cm x 2 cm x 1.5 cm. Using this detector-array
   system, from a Co-60 measurement, 41.5\% of recorded events in the
   energy window from 1100 keV to 1200 keV are two-interaction events. The
   goal of this work is to increase the efficiency of this deconvolution
   algorithm by extending the calculation of the system response functions
   to events with other number of interactions. We first analytically
   extend the system response function calculation to three-interaction
   events by deriving the probability density function, considering the
   measurement noise, and integrating over the digitization and pixelation
   volume. The system response function is then simplified, modularized,
   and extrapolated to events with other numbers of interactions from an
   array system. By including events with any number of interactions in the
   system model, imaging makes use of all recorded events, and the angular
   resolution is improved. This deconvolution algorithm is applicable to
   any gamma-ray detector system that has the capability of recording 3D
   interaction location and energy deposition for each interaction.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{169-186}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   The importance of ethics education in professional engineering
   preparation programs is well established, yet student outcomes remain
   mixed despite the efforts of engineering educators.
   PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS)
   A long line of research has suggested that students and faculty often
   have different perceptions of educational efforts and practices. In this
   study, we consider this as a potential reason for the continued mixed
   results of engineering ethics education by examining differing
   perceptions of faculty and students about ethics education and
   identifying contributing factors to those differences.
   DESIGN/METHOD
   We conducted focus groups and interviews with engineering undergraduate
   students, faculty, and administrators on 18 campuses. Transcripts were
   analyzed using both deductive and inductive analyses and constant
   comparison. We identified both themes of discrepancies between
   faculty/administrator and student perceptions and factors in the
   educational environment that contributed to those discrepancies.
   RESULTS
   Discrepancies between the perceptions of faculty/administrators were
   seen in two forms. Faculty/administrators believed that ethics education
   encompasses teaching about laws, ethical codes, and other
   black-and-white solutions while also addressing more nuanced ethical
   dilemmas; students reported only experiencing the laws-and-rules
   approach. Students also did not see faculty as the positive ethical role
   models that faculty believed they are. Factors that contribute to both
   types of discrepancies are identified and reported.
   CONCLUSIONS
   This approach can be effective in examining difficulties in teaching
   engineering ethics. Educators should take steps to understand the
   different ways faculty/administrators and students perceive ethics
   education, and how factors in the educational environment contribute to
   differences in those perceptions.}},

Title = {{An Exploratory Investigation of the Ethical Behavior of Engineering
   Undergraduates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{346-374}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Recent national reports have indicated the need for an increased
   emphasis on the ethical development of engineering undergraduates.
   Despite this call for increased focus on ethical development, little is
   known about how engineering students make ethical decisions or how these
   decisions are related to personal differences and environmental
   influences.
   PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS)
   This is an exploratory investigation to determine which demographic,
   academic, moral reasoning, and decision-making variables are predictive
   of the extent of test cheating among engineering undergraduates. Rather
   than beginning with a particular hypothesis, the study investigates
   predictive relationships between the variables described above and
   self-reported rates of test cheating among engineering undergraduates.
   DESIGN/METHOD
   Three hundred and eighty eight engineering undergraduates from three
   Midwestern U. S. institutions completed a survey based on a modified
   version of the theory of planned behavior as a conceptual framework. The
   three institutions are of different Carnegie classifications, sizes,
   missions, and institutional cultures.
   RESULTS
   Results indicate that our proposed model of ethical decision-making was
   successful in predicting the behavioral outcome with regard to college
   test cheating and there were observed significant differences in the
   level of cheating between institutions. However, institution as a
   variable was not a predictive of behavior.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The effect of institution on cheating was mitigated through other
   measured variables including past high school cheating, involvement in
   Pan-Hellenic groups, moral obligation, and perceived behavioral control.
   It is these underlying predictive variables that need to be addressed
   when engineering educators and student affairs staff consider the issue
   of unethical undergraduate behavior.}},

   indirectly measures the human performance in making choices, such as
   selecting parts, tools, fixtures, and assembly procedures in a
   multi-product, multi-stage, manual assembly environment. The complexity
   measure and its model for assembly lines have been developed in an
   earlier paper by the authors. According to the complexity models
   developed, assembly sequence determines the directions in which
   complexity flows. Thus proper assembly sequence planning can reduce
   complexity. However, due to the difficulty of handling the directions of
   complexity flows in optimization, a transformed network flow model is
   formulated and solved based on dynamic programming. Methodologies
   developed in this paper extend the previous work on modeling complexity,
   and provide solution strategies for assembly sequence planning to
   minimize complexity. (C) 2011 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

   First published January 18, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00314.2011.-Irregular
   vestibular afferents exhibit significant phase leads with respect to
   angular velocity of the head in space. This characteristic and their
   connectivity with vestibulospinal neurons suggest a functionally
   important role for these afferents in producing the vestibulo-collic
   reflex (VCR). A goal of these experiments was to test this hypothesis
   with the use of weak galvanic stimulation of the vestibular periphery
   (GVS) to selectively activate or suppress irregular afferents during
   passive whole body rotation of guinea pigs that could freely move their
   heads. Both inhibitory and excitatory GVS had significant effects on
   compensatory head movements during sinusoidal and transient whole body
   rotations. Unexpectedly, GVS also strongly affected the vestibulo-ocular
   reflex (VOR) during passive whole body rotation. The effect of GVS on
   the VOR was comparable in light and darkness and whether the head was
   restrained or unrestrained. Significantly, there was no effect of GVS on
   compensatory eye and head movements during volitional head motion, a
   confirmation of our previous study that demonstrated the extravestibular
   nature of anticipatory eye movements that compensate for voluntary head
   movements.}},

Abstract = {{About 50 per cent of all known hot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) reside in
   close (short-period) binaries, for which common-envelope ejection is the
   most likely formation mechanism. However, Han et al. predict that the
   majority of sdBs should form through stable mass transfer leading to
   long-period binaries. Determining orbital periods for these systems is
   challenging and while the orbital periods of similar to 100 short-period
   systems have been measured, there are no periods measured above 30 d. As
   part of a large programme to characterize the orbital periods of sdB
   binaries and their formation history, we have found that PG 1018-047 has
   an orbital period of 759.8 +/- 5.8 d, easily making it the longest
   period ever detected for a sdB binary. Exploiting the Balmer lines of
   the subdwarf primary and the narrow absorption lines of the companion
   present in the spectra, we derive the radial velocity amplitudes of both
   stars, and estimate the mass ratio MMS/MsdB= 1.6 +/- 0.2. From the
   combination of visual and infrared photometry, the spectral type of the
   companion star is determined to be mid-K.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Functional tests have demonstrated minimal loss of vaginal closure
   force with age. So we tested the null hypotheses that age neither
   affects the maximum cross-sectional area (CSA) nor the volume of the
   levator muscle. Corresponding hypotheses were also tested in the
   adjacent obturator internus muscle, which served as a control for the
   effect of age on appendicular muscle in these women. Methods: Magnetic
   resonance images of 15 healthy younger (aged 21-25 years) and 12 healthy
   older nulliparous women (aged > 63 years) were selected to avoid the
   confounding effect of childbirth. Models were created from tracing
   outlines of the levator ani muscle in the coronal plane, and obturator
   internus in the axial plane using 3D Slicer v. 3.4. Muscle volumes were
   calculated using Slicer, while CSA was measured using Imageware TM at
   nine locations. The hypotheses were tested using repeated measures
   analysis of variance with P < 0.05 being considered significant.
   Results: The effect of age did not reach statistical significance for
   the decrease in levator ani muscle maximum CSA or the decrease in volume
   (4.3\%, P 0.62 and 10.9\%, 0.12, respectively). However, age did
   significantly adversely decrease obturator internus muscle maximum CSA
   and volume (24.5\% and 28.2\%, P < 0.001, respectively). Significant
   local age-related changes were observed dorsally in both muscles.
   Conclusions: Unlike the adjacent appendicular muscle, obturator
   internus, the levator ani muscle in healthy nullipara does not show
   evidence of significant age-related atrophy. Neurourol. Urodynam. 31:

Abstract = {{Strength training that overloads lengthening muscle fibers may result in
   greater strength gains with less effort and perceived exertion than
   conventional training modalities. This study evaluates a device capable
   of this overloading (a motor-driven and computer-controlled leg press)
   to develop recommendations for future training interventions. Unimpaired
   younger and older men and women (7/group, total n = 28) performed three
   maximal-effort trials for both directions of footplate motion (IN and
   OUT) at three speed profiles (knee rotation speeds of 15, 25, and 35
   degrees/s) on a motor-driven and computer-controlled leg press.
   Normalized forces were tested for effects of age group, sex, direction
   of footplate motion, and knee rotation speed. Peak forces were 57\%
   greater for younger and 20\% greater for IN. Trends of greater IN
   relative to OUT forces (IN overloading) were present in women, but this
   was due to an inverse correlation between strength and IN overloading
   that was independent of age group and sex. Leg press strength training
   on a device that is capable of overloading lengthening muscle fibers is
   a promising new training method that appears to have the greatest
   potential benefits for the weakest participants. Training target
   profiles on the device tested and others similar to it should be set
   based on participant-specific maximums across the ROM in both IN and OUT
   directions at a speed in the middle of the range to be trained.

Abstract = {{It has been reported that a carbon nanotube (CNT) is one of the
   strongest materials with its high failure stress and strain. Moreover,
   the nanotube has many favorable features, such as high toughness, great
   flexibility, low density, and so on. This discovery has opened new
   opportunities in various engineering applications, for example, a
   nanocomposite material design. However, recent studies have found a
   substantial discrepancy between computational and experimental material
   property predictions, in part due to defects in the fabricated
   nanotubes. It is found that the nanotubes are highly defective in many
   different formations (e.g., vacancy, dislocation, chemical, and
   topological defects). Recent parametric studies with vacancy defects
   have found that the vacancy defects substantially affect mechanical
   properties of the nanotubes. Given random existence of the nanotube
   defects, the material properties of the nanotubes can be better
   understood through statistical modeling of the defects. This paper
   presents predictive CNT models, which enable to estimate mechanical
   properties of the CNTs and the nanocomposites under various sources of
   uncertainties. As the first step, the density and location of vacancy
   defects will be randomly modeled to predict mechanical properties. It
   has been reported that the eigenvector dimension reduction (EDR) method
   performs probability analysis efficiently and accurately. In this paper,
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with a modified Morse potential model
   is integrated with the EDR method to predict the mechanical properties
   of the CNTs. To demonstrate the feasibility of the predicted model,
   probabilistic behavior of mechanical properties (e.g., failure stress,
   failure strain, and toughness) is compared with the precedent experiment
   results.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the effect of emulsion fluidization on the gas and

   is examined. Implementing a Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) technique,
   the gas and particulate phase velocities of a gas jet injected into a
   bubbling bed of 838 mu m high-density polyethylene (HDPE) micropellets
   were measured. These velocity profiles were used to determine the volume
   fraction, mass flow, and momentum transport rate for each phase at
   various axial locations as well as an average particle drag coefficient
   in the measurement region of the plume. Maintaining consistent gas jet
   inlet conditions, the HDPE emulsion fluidization was varied from a
   spouted bed to 50\% beyond minimum fluidization. In addition to the
   integral flow values, centerline phase velocity scaling is also
   examined. The scaling is based on the development of similarity velocity
   profiles for the two phases. Additional experiments to investigate this
   idea were carried out with 1) the particle emulsion and fluidization
   level is held constant while the jet inlet velocity is varied and 2) the
   jet inlet velocity and fluidization ratio is held constant while the bed
   particles are varied. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel analysis technique, invariant density analysis
   (IDA), is introduced. IDA quantifies steady-state behavior of the
   postural control system using center of pressure (COP) data collected
   during quiet standing. IDA relies on the analysis of a reduced-order
   finite Markov model to characterize stochastic behavior observed during
   postural sway. Five IDA parameters characterize the model and offer
   physiological insight into the long-term dynamical behavior of the
   postural control system. Two studies were performed to demonstrate the
   efficacy of IDA. Study 1 showed that multiple short trials can be
   concatenated to create a dataset suitable for IDA. Study 2 demonstrated
   that IDA was effective at distinguishing age-related differences in
   postural control behavior between young, middle-aged, and older adults.
   These results suggest that the postural control system of young adults
   converges more quickly to their steady-state behavior while maintaining
   COP nearer an overall centroid than either the middle-aged or older
   adults. Additionally, larger entropy values for older adults indicate
   that their COP follows a more stochastic path, while smaller entropy
   values for young adults indicate a more deterministic path. These
   results illustrate the potential of IDA as a quantitative tool for the
   assessment of the quiet-standing postural control system.}},

Abstract = {{Increased rates of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation have been reported in
   humans treated with TNF-alpha (TNF)-neutralizing drugs, and higher rates
   are observed with anti-TNF Abs (e.g., infliximab) as compared with TNF
   receptor fusion protein (etanercept). Mechanisms driving differential
   reactivation rates and differences in drug action are not known. We use
   a computational model of a TB granuloma formation that includes TNF/TNF
   receptor dynamics to elucidate these mechanisms. Our analyses yield
   three important insights. First, drug binding to membrane-bound TNF
   critically impairs granuloma function. Second, a higher risk of
   reactivation induced from Ab-type treatments is primarily due to
   differences in TNF/drug binding kinetics and permeability. Apoptotic and
   cytolytic activities of Abs and pharmacokinetic fluctuations in blood
   concentration of drug are not essential to inducing TB reactivation.
   Third, we predict specific host factors that, if augmented, would
   improve granuloma function during anti-TNF therapy. Our findings have
   implications for the development of safer anti-TNF drugs to treat
   inflammatory diseases. The Journal of Immunology, 2012, 188: 3169-3178.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The goal of the authors is to restore fine motor control and
   sensation for high-arm amputees. They developed a regenerative
   peripheral nerve interface with the aim of attaining closed loop neural
   control by integrating directly with the amputee's residual motor and
   sensory peripheral nerves. PEDOT, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), has
   both electrical and ionic conduction characteristics. This hybrid
   character could help bridge the salutatory conduction of the nervous
   system to an electrode. The purpose of this study was to determine
   whether electrodes polymerized with PEDOT have improved ability to both
   record and stimulate peripheral nerve action potentials.
   Methods: Impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were performed on
   electrodes before and after polymerization to measure electrode
   impedance and charge capacity. Both recording needle and bipolar
   stimulating electrodes were polymerized with PEDOT. Plain and PEDOT
   electrodes were tested using rat (n = 18) in situ nerve conduction
   studies. The peroneal nerve was stimulated using a bipolar electrode at
   multiple locations along the nerve. Action potentials were measured in
   the extensor digitorum longus muscle.
   Results: Bench testing showed PEDOT electrodes had a higher charge
   capacity and lower impedance than plain electrodes, indicating
   significantly improved electrode fidelity. Nerve conduction testing
   indicated a significant reduction in the stimulus threshold for both
   PEDOT recording and PEDOT stimulatory electrodes when compared with
   plain electrodes, indicating an increase in sensitivity.
   Conclusions: PEDOT electrochemical polymerization improves electrode
   fidelity. Electrodes that have been electropolymerized with PEDOT show
   improved sensitivity when recording or stimulating action potentials at
   the tissue-electrode interface. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 129: 933, 2012.)}},

   after irradiation, called post-irradiation fading, were studied.
   Dosemeters were subjected to up to 33 d of pre-irradiation and 68 d of
   post-irradiation storage. For pre-irradiation fading, peak 5 showed a
   signal increase of approximate to 30 and peak 4 showed an approximate to
   30 decrease in 20 d. The sum of the areas of peaks 4 and 5 remained
   relatively constant even for long pre-irradiation times, although at
   50C, losses in peak 5 signal were too significant to maintain the sum of
   peaks 4 and 5 constant. Peak 3 was still detectable even at 50C and the
   longest irradiation times, but peak 2 was very difficult to detect after
   1520 d, especially with post-irradiation fading.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Because continuity of care (CC) is a necessary component of
   resident education, this analysis was done to understand what keeps CC
   between residents and patients low and how it can be most effectively
   improved.
   Background: Many authors lament low CC between residents and patients,
   especially in the era of duty hour regulations. Some have tried
   lengthening rotations, some have tried increasing clinic attendance, and
   some have argued for various training models. Little detailed analysis
   has been done to identify root causes of low CC or ways to improve it.
   Methods: Two months of charts were reviewed to estimate baseline CC on a
   vascular surgery rotation. Probability theory and engineering
   simulations were used to determine whether CC can be enhanced by (a)
   lengthening rotations, (b) altering observed logistical patterns, (c)
   using a ``resident return{''} model where residents are able to see
   patients postoperatively even if moved to a different rotation, or (d)
   employing an apprenticeship model.
   Results: Baseline analysis showed residents had 0\% CC given 131
   opportunities to do so. Probability analysis and the simulation outcomes
   suggest that rotation length plays a minor role in achieving CC.
   Logistical changes showed some improvement in CC, but not as much as
   using an apprenticeship rotation model.
   Conclusions: The limitations placed on CC by rotation duration are real,
   but lengthening the rotation does not meaningfully resolve the gap
   between acceptable CC levels and actual levels. Although CC can be
   enhanced with longer rotations if coupled with the use of the resident
   return model, the greater barrier to CC is the logistical patterns such
   as where residents spend time, how cases are assigned, and the lack of
   an alert system to inform residents about returning postoperative
   patients. The apprenticeship model enables residents to achieve CC
   closer to that of the faculty.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that bone composition and tissue-level
   mechanical properties are significant determinants of skeletal
   integrity. In the current study, Raman spectroscopy and nanoindentation
   testing were co-localized to analyze tissue-level compositional and
   mechanical properties in skeletally mature young (4 or 5 months) and old
   (19 months) murine femora at similar spatial scales. Standard
   multivariate linear regression analysis revealed age-dependent patterns
   in the relationships between mechanical and compositional properties at
   the tissue scale. However, changes in bone material properties with-age
   are often complex and nonlinear, and can be missed with linear
   regression and correlation-based methods. A retrospective data mining
   approach was implemented using non-linear multidimensional visualization
   and classification to identify spectroscopic and nanoindentation metrics
   that best discriminated bone specimens of different age-classes. The
   ability to classify the specimens into the correct age group increased
   by using combinations of Raman and nanoindentation variables (86-96\%
   accuracy) as compared to using individual measures (59-79\% accuracy).
   Metrics that best classified 4 or 5 month and 19 month specimens (2-age
   classes) were mineral to matrix ratio, crystallinity, modulus and
   plasticity index. Metrics that best distinguished between 4,5 and 19
   month specimens (3-age classes) were mineral to matrix ratio,
   crystallinity, modulus, hardness, cross-linking, carbonate to phosphate
   ratio, creep displacement and creep viscosity. These findings attest to
   the complexity of mechanisms underlying bone tissue properties and draw
   attention to the importance of considering non-linear interactions
   between tissue-level composition and mechanics that may work together to
   influence material properties with age. The results demonstrate that a
   few non-linearly combined compositional and mechanical metrics provide
   better discriminatory information than a single metric or a single
   technique. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most cancers contain a small sub-population of cells that are endowed
   with self-renewal, multipotency, and a unique potential for tumor
   initiation. These properties are considered hallmarks of cancer stem
   cells. Here, we provide an overview of the field of cancer stem cells
   with a focus on head and neck cancers. Cancer stem cells are located in
   the invasive fronts of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)
   close to blood vessels (perivascular niche). Endothelial cell-initiated
   signaling events are critical for the survival and self-renewal of these
   stem cells. Markers such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), CD133, and
   CD44 have been successfully used to identify highly tumorigenic cancer
   stem cells in HNSCC. This review briefly describes the orosphere assay,
   a method for in vitro culture of undifferentiated head and neck cancer
   stem cells under low attachment conditions. Notably, recent evidence
   suggests that cancer stem cells are exquisitely resistant to
   conventional therapy and are the ``drivers{''} of local recurrence and
   metastatic spread. The emerging understanding of the role of cancer stem
   cells in the pathobiology of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
   might have a profound impact on the treatment paradigms for this

Abstract = {{With most tele-operated robots the operator's only feedback is the view
   from an onboard camera. Live video lets the operator observe the robot's
   immediate surroundings but does not establish the orientation or
   whereabouts of the robot in its environment. An additional plot of the
   robot's trajectory would be helpful for the operator and is sometimes
   provided, based on GPS. However, indoors where GPS is unavailable,
   tracking has to rely on dead-reckoning, which is too inaccurate to be
   useful. Our proposed TelOpTrak method corrects dead-reckoning errors
   even when only odometry and a low-cost (and thus, high-drift) MEMS-class
   gyro are available on the robot. TelOpTrak corrects gyro drift by
   exploiting the structured nature of most buildings, but without having
   to directly sense building features. This paper explains the TelOpTrak
   method and provides comprehensive experimental results.
   Earlier versions of this paper (Borenstein et al., 2010a), (Borenstein
   et al., 2010b) were presented at two conferences. The main difference
   between the earlier conference papers and the present manuscript is that
   the latter is more comprehensive, more up-to-date, and it presents an
   entirely new set of experimental results, including results of a live
   demonstration at the 2010 Robotics Rodeo event at Ft. Benning, USA.}},

Abstract = {{Deterioration of bridges under repeated traffic loading has called
   attention to the need for improvements in the understanding of
   vehicle-bridge interaction. While analytical and numerical models have
   been previously explored to describe the interaction that exists between
   a sprung mass (i.e., a moving vehicle) and an elastic beam (i.e.,
   bridge), comparatively less research has been focused on the
   experimental observation of vehicle-bridge interaction. A wireless
   monitoring system with wireless sensors installed on both the bridge and
   moving vehicle is proposed to record the dynamic interaction between the
   bridge and vehicle. Time-synchronized vehicle-bridge response data is
   used within a two-stage system identification methodology. In the first
   stage, the free-vibration response of the bridge is used to identify the
   dynamic characteristics of the bridge. In the second stage, the
   vehicle-bridge response data is used to identify the time varying load
   imposed on the bridge from the vehicle. To test the proposed monitoring
   and system identification strategy, the 180 m long Yeondae Bridge
   (Icheon, Korea) was selected. A dense network of wireless sensors was
   installed on the bridge while wireless sensors were installed on a
   multi-axle truck. The truck was driven across the bridge at constant
   velocity with bridge and vehicle responses measured. Excellent agreement
   between the measured Yeondae Bridge response and that predicted by an
   estimated vehicle-bridge interaction model validates the proposed
   strategy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Vibration-Induced Motor Responses of Infants With and Without
   Myelomeningocele}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL THERAPY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{537-550}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background. The severity of myelomeningocele (MMC) stems both from a
   loss of neurons due to neural tube defect and a loss of function in
   viable neurons clue to reduced movement experience during the first year
   after birth. In young infants with MMC, the challenge is to reinforce
   excitability and voluntary control of all available neurons. Muscle
   vibration paired with voluntary movement may increase motoneuron
   excitability and contribute to improvements in neural organization;
   responsiveness, and control.
   Objectives. This study examined whether infants with or without MMC
   respond to vibration by altering their step or stance behavior when
   supported upright on a treadmill.
   Design. This was a cross-sectional study.
   Methods. Twenty-four 2- to 10-month-old infants, 12 with typical
   development (TD) and 12 with MMC (lumbar and sacral lesions), were
   tested. Infants were supported upright with their feet in contact with a
   stationary or moving treadmill during 30-second trials. Rhythmic
   alternating vibrations were applied to the right and left rectus femoris
   muscles, the lateral gastrocnemius muscle, or the sole of the foot. Two
   cameras and behavior coding were used to determine step count, step
   type, and motor response to vibration onset.
   Results. Step count decreased and swing duration increased in infants
   with TD during vibration of the sole of the foot on a moving treadmill
   (FT-M trials). Across all groups the percentage of single steps
   increased during vibration of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle on a
   moving treadmill. Infants with MMC and younger infants with TD responded
   to onset of vibration with leg straightening during rectus femoris
   muscle stimulation and by stepping during FT-M trials more often than
   older infants with TD.
   Conclusions. Vibration seems a viable option for increasing motor
   responsiveness in infants with MMC. Follow-up studies are needed to
   identify optimal methods of administering vibration to maximize step and
   stance behavior in infants.}},

Abstract = {{Induced biomineralization of materials has been employed as a strategy
   to increase integration with host tissue, and more recently as a method
   to control cell function in tissue engineering. However, mineralization
   is typically performed in the absence of cells, since hypertonic
   solutions that lack the nutrients and culture components required for
   the maintenance of cell viability are often used. In the present study,
   we exposed fibroblast-seeded three-dimensional collagen-chitosan
   hydrogels to a defined culture medium modified to have specific
   concentrations of ions involved in biomineralization. The modified
   medium caused a significant increase in calcium deposition in
   collagen-chitosan gels, relative to constructs incubated in a standard
   medium, though serum supplementation attenuated mineral deposition.
   Collagen-chitosan constructs became opaque over 3 days of mineralization
   in modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), in contrast to
   translucent control gels incubated in standard DMEM. Histological
   staining confirmed increased levels of mineral in the treated
   constructs. Rheological characterization showed that both the storage
   and loss moduli increased significantly in mineralized materials.
   Mineralization of fibroblast-seeded constructs resulted in decreased
   cell viability and proliferation rate over 3 days of incubation in
   modified medium, but the cell population remained over 75\% viable and
   regained its proliferative potential after rescue in standard culture
   medium. The ability to mineralize protein matrices in the presence of
   cells could be useful in creating mechanically stable tissue constructs,
   as well as to study the effects of the tissue microenvironment on cell
   function. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Using stereolithography, 20 different structural variations comprised of
   millimeter diameter holes surrounded by trenches, plateaus, or
   micro-ring structures were prepared and tested for their ability to
   stably hold arrays of microliter sized droplets within the structures
   over an extended period of time. The micro-ring structures were the most
   effective in stabilizing droplets against mechanical and chemical
   perturbations. After confirming the importance of micro-ring structures
   using rapid prototyping, we developed an injection molding tool for mass
   production of polystyrene 3D cell culture plates with an array of 384
   such micro-ring surrounded through-hole structures. These newly designed
   and injection molded polystyrene 384 hanging drop array plates with
   micro-rings were stable and robust against mechanical perturbations as
   well as surface fouling-facilitated droplet spreading making them
   capable of long term cell spheroid culture of up to 22 days within the
   droplet array. This is a significant improvement over previously
   reported 384 hanging drop array plates which are susceptible to small
   mechanical shocks and could not reliably maintain hanging drops for
   longer than a few days. With enhanced droplet stability, the hanging
   drop array plates with micro-ring structures provide better platforms
   and open up new opportunities for high-throughput preparation of
   microscale 3D cell constructs for drug screening and cell analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of a premixed methane/air flame with flow unsteadiness
   is studied computationally using a stagnation-point flow configuration.
   The problem is of fundamental interest and also relevant for turbulent
   combustion in the laminar flamelet regime. In the present study, of
   particular interest is the flame residing in a weakly strained flow
   field such that the flame is stabilized away from the viscous boundary
   layer adjacent to the stagnation plane and is free to move in response
   to flow perturbations. An unsteady sinusoidal strain rate field is
   imposed on the flame, and an extensive parametric study is conducted by
   varying the frequency and amplitude of strain rate fluctuation. It is
   found that for high frequencies and large amplitudes, flow direction
   reverses upstream of the flame, thereby establishing a new stagnation
   plane in the preheat zone ahead of the flame. This observation indicates
   that the flame strongly affects the upstream flow field and could also
   possibly explain the reported occurence of flow reversal in experimental
   studies of turbulent jet flames. Effects of other key parameters such as
   the Lewis number, mean flame speed, and gas expansion ratio on
   flame-flow interaction and flow reversal are studied by investigating
   highly lean (Le < 1) and rich (Le > 1) hydrogen/air flames. The physical
   mechanism responsible for flow reversal phenomenon is explained. (C)

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{159}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing interest in utilizing syngas in gas turbine
   applications, the characterization of H-2/CO combustion and reaction
   chemistry under high-pressure and moderate-temperature operating
   conditions has been the focus of recent investigations. Different
   chemical-kinetics and hydrodynamic processes have been identified as
   being responsible for the discrepancies between experimental
   measurements and kinetic predictions of syngas ignition delay times.
   This contribution complements previous studies, and provides improved
   understanding about the role of turbulence and fluctuations in
   temperature and mixture composition on the syngas combustion process in
   rapid compression machines (RCMs). To this end, a self-contained model
   is developed that describes the ignition and combustion process by
   considering the interaction between turbulence, detailed reaction
   chemistry, and wall heat loss effects. Different mechanisms can be
   identified as being responsible for the generation of inhomogeneities in
   flow-field, temperature, and mixture composition, including
   turbulence-generation during the filling process, corner vortices,
   wall-generated turbulence, and mixing between fluid in the core region
   and the boundary layer. In the present model, these contributions are
   parametrically represented in terms of initial turbulence levels, and
   the mean-strain amplification of these perturbations during the
   compression phase is described using rapid distortion theory. The model
   is applied to different syngas mixtures and operating conditions,
   including pressures up to 20 atm and temperatures between 600 and 1300
   K. Parametric studies show that the model captures experimentally
   observed trends of reduced ignition delay and prolonged reaction
   progress during the ignition phase. A Damkohler criterion is proposed in
   order to characterize the sensitivity of the induction chemistry to
   turbulence fluctuations. Results suggest that syngas mixtures with
   Damkohler numbers below 50 exhibit increasing sensitivity to turbulence
   and mixture fluctuations. This parametric study indicates that the
   turbulence/chemistry interaction can play an equally important role in
   affecting the syngas ignition chemistry, and requires consideration in
   addition to chemical-kinetics and hydrodynamic processes previously
   identified as leading mechanisms for the observed discrepancy in syngas
   ignition. (C) 2011 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an active steganalysis method for quantization index
   modulation (QIM)-based steganography. The proposed nonparametric
   steganalysis method uses irregularity (or randomness) in the test image
   to distinguish between the cover image and the stego image. We have
   shown that plain quantization (quantization without message embedding)
   induces regularity in the resulting quantized object, whereas message
   embedding using QIM increases irregularity in the resulting QIM-stego.
   Approximate entropy, an algorithmic entropy measure, is used to quantify
   irregularity in the test image. The QIM-stego image is then analyzed to
   estimate secret message length. To this end, the QIM codebook is
   estimated from the QIM-stego image using first-order statistics of the
   image coefficients in the embedding domain. The estimated codebook is
   then used to estimate secret message. Simulation results show that the
   proposed scheme can successfully estimate the hidden message from the
   QIM-stego with very low decoding error probability. For a given cover
   object the decoding error probability depends on embedding rate and
   decreases mono-tonically, approaching zero as the embedding rate
   approaches one.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with joint Bayesian endmember extraction and
   linear unmixing of hyperspectral images using a spatial prior on the
   abundance vectors. We propose a generative model for hyperspectral
   images in which the abundances are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution
   (DD) mixture model, whose parameters depend on a latent label process.
   The label process is then used to enforces a spatial prior which
   encourages adjacent pixels to have the same label. A Gibbs sampling
   framework is used to generate samples from the posterior distributions
   of the abundances and the parameters of the DD mixture model. The
   spatial prior that is used is a tree-structured sticky hierarchical
   Dirichlet process (SHDP) and, when used to determine the posterior
   endmember and abundance distributions, results in a new unmixing
   algorithm called spatially constrained unmixing (SCU). The directed
   Markov model facilitates the use of scale-recursive estimation
   algorithms, and is therefore more computationally efficient as compared
   to standard Markov random field (MRF) models. Furthermore, the proposed
   SCU algorithm estimates the number of regions in the image in an
   unsupervised fashion. The effectiveness of the proposed SCU algorithm is
   illustrated using synthetic and real data.}},

Title = {{Generation of heat and stress during the cure of polymers used in fiber

Abstract = {{The modeling of coupled heat generation, cure, evolution of mechanical
   properties, and stress generation during the solidification of a polymer
   epoxy is investigated. Heat conduction and cure kinetics are governed by
   a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. In the
   special cases of perfect insulators or perfect conductors, the equations
   are solved in closed form. Otherwise they are solved numerically. The
   sensitivity of curing time, maximum temperature during cure and curing
   stresses are discussed with respect to the chemical and thermal
   parameters and the volume of material that is cured. It is seen that
   smaller volumes of the same material cure at a fairly uniform rate
   whereas a sharp increase in the curing rate is obtained as the volume of
   material to be cured is increased. Subsequently a model is introduced to
   describe the stress generation during cure. The cure dependent material
   properties of Epon 862/Epikure 9553 are presented. Finally it is shown
   that the volume dependency of temperature during cure leads to stresses
   in an otherwise homogeneous body. Proper knowledge of the post cure
   stress state is important as this may alter the effective, or in situ,
   properties of the cured epoxy (Song, Waas, Shahwan, Faruque, \& Xiao,
   2008; Song, Waas, Shahwan, Faruque, \& Xiao, 2009; Song, Waas, Shahwan,
   Xiao, \& Faruque, 2007; Yerramalli \& Waas, 2002). In turn, the in situ
   properties are a crucial ingredient in any subsequent predictive
   methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the viability of bulk metal foils, in particular
   platinum-rhodium (Pt-Rh), for use in high power micromechanical relays.
   The electrical and thermal response of electrostatically actuated
   three-terminal micro-relays is evaluated. The micro-relays have a
   footprint of 6.5 mm(2) and an actuation area of 1.32 mm(2). A stacked
   double cantilever structure isolates the actuation electrode from the
   current path. A micromachined heat sink is located on the upper
   cantilever. The devices are fabricated by micro-electrodischarge
   machining and directly assembled on power rated printed circuit boards.
   The impact of contact materials, and forced cooling is addressed.
   Preliminary results suggest that the Pt-Rh devices have total on-state
   resistances of 1.25 Omega and can handle currents substantially in
   excess of 1 A. and potentially in excess of 2.6 A. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A composite structure comprising high strength titanium (Ti) alloy core
   and a high surface area pure Ti coating can be ideal for implant
   applications. In this work, the corrosion behaviour of pure Ti coatings
   composed of porous top layer (similar to 100 mu m) and dense bottom
   layer (similar to 500 mu m) obtained by cold spray method has been
   investigated. The porous top layer satisfies the high surface area
   requirement for the implant and the dense bottom layer ensures a good
   corrosion protection of the substrate and also good bond strength. In
   order to further improve the corrosion and mechanical property of cold
   sprayed Ti coatings, heat treatment (850 degrees C for 5 h) was applied.
   Electrochemical potentiodynamic and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were used to characterise the
   electrochemical corrosion behaviour of the cold sprayed Ti coatings in
   Hanks' solution. For comparison, the corrosion and mechanical properties
   of annealed and un-annealed wrought Ti substrates were also
   investigated. Our results showed that the as sprayed Ti coatings
   exhibited a relatively lower corrosion resistance than those for pure Ti
   substrate. However, post-spray heat treatment improved the corrosion
   resistance to a level close to that of the bulk material. Furthermore,
   EIS studies revealed that the newly formed dense and structurally stable
   oxide layer on the surface of the coating during potentiodynamic
   scanning was beneficial to the corrosion behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Changes occur in muscles and nerves with aging. In this

   plane ankle proprioceptive thresholds, and ankle and hip motor function
   were tested in 41 subjects with a spectrum of lower limb sensorimotor
   function ranging from healthy to moderately severe diabetic neuropathy.
   Results: Frontal plane hip and ankle sensorimotor function demonstrated
   significant relationships with UST. Multivariate analysis identified
   only composite hip strength, ankle proprioceptive threshold, and age to
   be significant predictors of UST (R2 = 0.73), explaining 46\%, 24\%, and
   3\% of the variance, respectively. Conclusions: Frontal plane hip
   strength was the single best predictor of UST and appeared to compensate
   for less precise ankle proprioceptive thresholds. This finding is
   clinically relevant given the possibility of strengthening the hip, even
   in patients with significant peripheral neuropathy. Muscle Nerve, 2012}},

   layer of the DRNFS make the system cope with temporal problems, which
   allows the robot to memorize the previous environment information. The
   parameters and structure of the DRNFS can be automatically optimized
   through the learning process. The parameter optimization is realized by
   the ordered derivative algorithm, and the structure simplification is
   completed by the fuzzy rules similarity measure. Simulation results are
   presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed system.}},

   along a uniform waveguide (such as a beam element) and are reflected
   and/or transmitted at discontinuities (such as boundaries and lumped
   mass attachments). The reflection relation corresponding to a bending
   incident vibration wave at the end mass is derived, which is assembled
   with propagation and reflection relations at classical boundaries to
   obtain the modes of vibrations. The effects of lumped end mass on

Abstract = {{Effective real-time monitoring of high-intensity focused ultrasound
   (HIFU) ablation is important for application of HIFU technology in

   changes during HIFU application. HIFU (4.33 MHz, 1 kHz PRF, 50\% duty
   cycle, 1 s, 2600-6100 W/cm(2)) was applied to ex vivo porcine cardiac
   tissue specimens with a confocally and perpendicularly aligned
   high-frequency imaging system (Visualsonics Vevo 770, 55 MHz center
   frequency). Radio-frequency (RF) data from M-mode imaging (1 kHz PRF, 2
   s x 7 mm) was acquired before, during and after HIFU treatment (n=12).
   Among several strategies, the temporal maximum integrated backscatter
   with a threshold of +12 dB change showed the best results for
   identifying final lesion width (receiver-operating characteristic curve
   area 0.91 +/- 0.04, accuracy 85 +/- 8\%, compared with macroscopic
   images of lesions). A criterion based on a line-to-line decorrelation
   coefficient is proposed for identification of transient gas bodies.

Abstract = {{It is well known that sensor duty-cycling is an important mechanism that
   helps densely deployed wireless sensor networks (WSNs) save energy. On
   the other hand, geographic forwarding is an efficient scheme for WSNs as
   it requires maintaining only local topology information to forward data
   to their destination. Most of geographic forwarding protocols assume
   that all sensors are always on (or active) during forwarding. However,
   such an assumption is unrealistic for real-world applications where
   sensors are switched on or off (or inactive). In this paper, we describe
   our cover-sense-inform (CSI) framework for k-covered WSNs, where each
   point in a sensor field is covered by at least k active sensors. In CSI,
   k-coverage, sensor scheduling, and data forwarding are jointly
   considered. Based on our previous work on connected k-coverage {[}3], we
   propose the first design of geographic forwarding protocols for
   duty-cycled k-covered WSNs with and without data aggregation. Then, we
   evaluate the performance of our joint k-coverage and geographic
   forwarding protocols and compare them to CCP {[}37], a k-Coverage
   Configuration Protocol, with a geographic forwarding protocol on top of
   it, such as BVGF {[}36], which we have slightly updated in such a way
   that it considers energy for a fair comparison. Simulation results show
   that our joint protocols outperform CCP+BVGF.}},

Abstract = {{Carriers are under increasing pressure to offset rising fuel charges
   with cost cutting or revenue generating schemes. One opportunity for
   cost reduction lies in asset management. This paper presents resource
   allocation scheduling models that can be used to assign truck loads to
   delivery times and trucks when delivery times are flexible. The paper
   makes two main contributions. First, we formulate the problem as a
   multi-objective optimization model - minimizing the number of trucks
   needed as well as the costs associated with tardiness or earliness - and
   demonstrate how improvements in fleet usage translate into savings which
   carriers can use as incentives to promote flexible delivery times for
   customers. Second, we show that a two-phase model with a polynomial
   algorithm in the second phase is able to produce optimal schedules in a
   reasonable time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries most frequently occur under
   the large loads associated with a unipedal jump landing involving a
   cutting or pivoting maneuver. We tested the hypotheses that internal
   tibial torque would increase the anteromedial (AM) bundle ACL relative
   strain and strain rate more than would the corresponding external tibial
   torque under the large impulsive loads associated with such landing
   maneuvers. Twelve cadaveric female knees {[}mean (SD) age: 65.0 (10.5)
   years] were tested. Pretensioned quadriceps, hamstring, and
   gastrocnemius muscle-tendon unit forces maintained an initial knee
   flexion angle of 15 degrees. A compound impulsive test load
   (compression, flexion moment, and internal or external tibial torque)
   was applied to the distal tibia while recording the 3D knee loads and
   tibofemoral kinematics. AM-ACL relative strain was measured using a 3?mm
   DVRT. In this repeated measures experiment, the Wilcoxon signed-rank
   test was used to test the null hypotheses with p<0.05 considered
   significant. The mean (+/- SD) peak AM-ACL relative strains were 5.4 +/-
   3.7\% and 3.1 +/- 2.8\% under internal and external tibial torque,
   respectively. The corresponding mean (+/- SD) peak AM-ACL strain rates
   reached 254.4 +/- 160.1\%/s and 179.4 +/- 109.9\%/s, respectively. The
   hypotheses were supported in that the normalized mean peak AM-ACL
   relative strain and strain rate were 70 and 42\% greater under internal
   than under external tibial torque, respectively (p=0.023, p=0.041). We
   conclude that internal tibial torque is a potent stressor of the ACL
   because it induces a considerably (70\%) larger peak strain in the
   AM-ACL than does a corresponding external tibial torque. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Synthetic microbial consortia that can mimic natural systems have the
   potential to become a powerful biotechnology for various applications.
   One highly desirable feature of these consortia is that they can be
   precisely regulated. In this work we designed a programmable, symbiotic
   circuit that enables continuous tuning of the growth rate and
   composition of a synthetic consortium. We implemented our general design
   through the cross-feeding of tryptophan and tyrosine by two E. coli
   auxotrophs. By regulating the expression of genes related to the export
   or production of these amino acids, we were able to tune the metabolite
   exchanges and achieve a wide range of growth rates and strain ratios. In
   addition, by inverting the relationship of growth/ratio vs. inducer
   concentrations, we were able to ``program{''} the co-culture for
   pre-specified attributes with the proper addition of inducing chemicals.
   This programmable proof-of-concept circuit or its variants can be
   applied to more complex systems where precise tuning of the consortium
   would facilitate the optimization of specific objectives, such as
   increasing the overall efficiency of microbial production of biofuels or
   pharmaceuticals.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach-cold spraying technique has been successfully used to
   deposit HAP/Ti composite coating on titanium substrate. The
   electrochemical corrosion behavior of cold sprayed 20 wt\% and 50 wt\%
   HAP/Ti composite coating has been evaluated in a simulated biomedical
   environment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron
   microscopy were applied to identify the phases and the morphologies of
   the coatings. Potentiodynamic polarization and EIS techniques were used
   to analyze the corrosion behavior in Hanks' solution. The microhardness
   measurements and shear punch tests were also conducted to investigate
   the mechanical property. It was found that cold sprayed 20 wt\% HAP/Ti
   coating showed relatively higher corrosion current than pure Ti and 50
   wt\% HAP/Ti coating in Hanks' solution, which indicates a low corrosion
   resistance. However, the post spray heat treatment improved the
   corrosion and mechanical properties remarkably. The results obtained in
   the present work demonstrate suitability of cold spraying technique to
   manufacture HAP/Ti composite coating on titanium substrate as
   load-bearing implant material for biomedical applications. (C) 2012
