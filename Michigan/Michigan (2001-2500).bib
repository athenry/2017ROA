Abstract = {{This paper presents a simulation platform for energy-efficient dynamic
   commuter transit using a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs). A
   mathematical model of the extended pickup and delivery problems is
   implemented to determine optimal routing and charging choices for all
   participating EVs in an urban network. The overall objective is to
   explore the optimal routes for a fleet of EVs while considering the
   requirements of all passengers and local/global constraints (e.g.
   battery state-of-charge and charging station availability). The
   simulation platform allows the commuter transit service provider to
   predict and evaluate every EV's performance (e.g., travel distance and
   travel time) under a variety of realistic scenarios. The proposed
   purpose-driven 1-click- solution helps to provide EV driver's assistance
   and improve the driving experience. Ultimately, the integrated solution
   or platform that can move the service provider's and driver's decision
   making process from being data-intensive to information-directed.}},

   interfaces might exhibit frictional slip which ceases after some loading
   cycles. In such cases, it is said that the system shakes down. For

   proved that Melan's theorem, originally proposed for elastic-plastic
   problems, offers a sufficient condition for the system to shake down,
   provided that the contact is of an uncoupled type. In the present paper,
   the application of Melan's theorem is speculated for systems involving

Abstract = {{A handful of recent cryptographic proposals rely on the conjectured
   hardness of the following problem in the ring of integers of a
   cyclotomic number field: given a basis of a principal ideal that is
   guaranteed to have a ``rather short{''} generator, find such a
   generator. Recently, Bernstein and Campbell-Groves-Shepherd sketched
   potential attacks against this problem; most notably, the latter authors
   claimed a polynomial-time quantum algorithm. (Alternatively, replacing
   the quantum component with an algorithm of Biasse and Fieker would yield
   a classical subexponential-time algorithm.) A key claim of Campbell et
   al. is that one step of their algorithm-namely, decoding the log-unit
   lattice of the ring to recover a short generator from an arbitrary
   one-is classically efficient (whereas the standard approach on general
   lattices takes exponential time). However, very few convincing details
   were provided to substantiate this claim.
   In this work, we clarify the situation by giving a rigorous proof that
   the log-unit lattice is indeed efficiently decodable, for any cyclotomic
   of prime-power index. Combining this with the quantum algorithm from a
   recent work of Biasse and Song confirms the main claim of Campbell et
   al. Our proof consists of two main technical contributions: the first is
   a geometrical analysis, using tools from analytic number theory, of the
   standard generators of the group of cyclotomic units. The second shows
   that for a wide class of typical distributions of the short generator, a
   standard lattice-decoding algorithm can recover it, given any generator.
   By extending our geometrical analysis, as a second main contribution we
   obtain an efficient algorithm that, given any generator of a principal
   ideal (in a prime-power cyclotomic), finds a 2((O) over tilde(root
   n))-approximate shortest vector in the ideal. Combining this with the
   result of Biasse and Song yields a quantum polynomial-time algorithm for
   the 2((O) over tilde(root n))-approximate Shortest Vector Problem on
   principal ideal lattices.}},

Abstract = {{The true value of a pipeline as an asset should be based on several
   factors that impact its service life. Those considerations include the
   consumption and production of raw materials, design, installation,
   operation and maintenance, and planning for the end of the pipeline's
   service life; as well as, the corresponding environmental impacts at
   each of these life cycle phases. In this paper, a model is presented
   that allows utilities and engineers to evaluate the total life cycle
   cost associated with a water transmission pipeline. The model is
   designed to compare Ductile Iron (DI) versus PVC pipe, two of the most
   commonly used pipe materials. In addition to the tangible cost
   comparisons, the model also includes an evaluation of environmental
   impacts that need to be considered by utilities to build or replace a
   transmission pipeline. Results from scenario analysis for 8 `' and 24 `'
   pipes illustrate that although PVC pipes have initial economic benefits
   (due to lower material costs), DI tends to be more cost effective and
   also comparatively environmentally sustainable (less CO2 emissions) over
   its service life.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional transition metal (TM)-Fe nanowires of single-atom width
   can be formed on a stepped Cu(111) surface. The electronic
   magneto-crystalline anisotropy and magnetic dipolar (shape) anisotropy
   energies are calculated for an isolated and deposited TM-Fe wire series
   that ranges from V to Co along the fourth period of elements. For linear
   atomic V chains, the shape anisotropy energy is comparable to the
   electronic energy. The shape anisotropy energy dominates for Cr/Mn
   chains while it has a minor influence for Co/Fe. The electronic
   contributions to the anisotropy energies are always dominant for TM-Fe
   wires in both isolated and deposited cases. All linear structures
   exhibit axial magnetization except for the Cr chain, which exhibits
   perpendicular magnetization. All isolated TM-Fe wires have large
   magnetic anisotropy energies and easy magnetization along the
   perpendicular axis. In deposited TM-Fe wires, the electronic anisotropy
   energies are higher for Mn-Fe and Fe-Fe and lower for V-Fe, Cr-Fe and
   Co-Fe wires. Deposited TM-Fe wires magnetize easily perpendicular to the
   Cu surface except for Co-Fe, which prefers in-plane magnetization. The
   large magnetic anisotropies of Fe-Fe and Mn-Fe wires points to potential
   application in ultra-high density data storage.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) encodes data in the signal probabilities
   associated with pseudo-random bit-streams. It enables very low-area and
   low-power arithmetic operations using standard VLSI circuits; it is also
   highly error-tolerant. While addition, subtraction and multiplication
   have extremely simple SC implementations, this is not true for division.
   Known stochastic dividers employ sequential logic circuits whose
   accuracy, convergence properties, etc., are unsatisfactory or not well
   understood. As a result, division is usually avoided or approximated in
   SC design. We first review and analyze in depth the existing design
   approaches to stochastic division. We then propose a novel division
   technique called CORDIV that exploits correlation between the input
   parameters. CORDIV not only has lower cost than previous stochastic
   dividers, but is also significantly more accurate. Area is reduced
   mainly because CORDIV requires less overhead for stochastic number
   conversion. We provide experimental data showing a typical 3x reduction
   in area and about a 10x improvement in accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) comprises a number of
   loosely-coupled independent services, which collaborate, interact and
   share data to accomplish incoming requests. A service invocation can
   involve multiple services, where each service accesses, processes and
   shares the client's data. These interactions may share data with
   unauthorized services and violate client's privacy. The client has no
   means of identifying if a violation occurred because it has no control
   over the service invocations beyond its trust domain. Such interactions
   introduce new security challenges which are not present in traditional
   systems. This paper proposes a data-centric approach for privacy
   preserving access control in SOA. Benefits of the proposed approach
   include the ability to dynamically define access polices by the clients
   and control data access at the time of each service interaction. A
   realistic healthcare scenario is used to evaluate the implementation of
   the proposed solution which validates its viability.}},

   formulate structured matching as a discrete optimization problem and
   relax it to a linear program. We use neural networks to embed regions

Abstract = {{This paper describes a cloud-based cyber infrastructure for the
   management of information involved in bridge monitoring applications.
   Recent years have seen an emergence and increasing use of sensor
   technologies for bridge monitoring. In addition to the measurement data
   from the sensors, bridge monitoring and management systems require many
   different types of information including bridge geometries, engineering
   analytical models and the metadata about the sensors. In this study, we
   employ cloud computing services and have implemented a cloud-based cyber
   infrastructure platform to effectively manage the information involved
   in bridge monitoring applications. Furthermore, NoSQL database systems
   are deployed for scalable and flexible data storage. To facilitate
   interoperability, a bridge information model is designed based on open
   standards and bridge engineering analysis and design tools. For
   demonstration purposes, the model of the Telegraph Road Bridge located
   in Michigan and the sensor data collected on the bridge are employed to
   illustrate the use of the cyber infrastructure system for bridge
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradation of municipal solid waste (MSW) is enhanced in bioreactor
   landfills via active leachate recirculation. Biogas consisting primarily
   of methane and carbon dioxide is generated during this process and can
   be recovered as an energy source. The physical, chemical, geotechnical
   and hydraulic characteristics of the waste are altered during active
   biodegradation. However, changes in these characteristics have not been
   examined closely in the field due to limitations in field measurements.
   Three laboratory simulators with diameters of 0.3 m and volumes of 42 L
   were filled with characterized MSW from landfills in Michigan and
   California to investigate the impact of waste composition on the
   degradation process. Leachate was recirculated frequently and the
   progression of MSW biodegradation was monitored via measurements of
   generation rate of biogas as well as chemical oxygen demand and pH of
   leachate. The total volume and total weight of the MSW were recorded
   continuously. The total unit weight, and volumetric water content were
   calculated. Hydraulic conductivity of the MSW was tested within the same
   simulators over time. Active biodegradation lasted for approximately 200
   days. While significant changes of the physical characteristics were
   observed during active biodegradation, the changes continued at lower
   rates even after 800 days. Changes in the physical and biochemical
   characteristics of the MSW are correlated with the initial waste
   composition through parameter B that is defined as the percentage of
   biodegradable constituents in the waste mass.}},

Abstract = {{The use of robots for surface methane concentration (SMC) monitoring at
   municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills has the potential to improve
   quality of data acquisition for fugitive methane measurement over
   current practices. Methane concentrations vary significantly, both
   spatially and temporally, across a MSW landfill. However, current
   monitoring methods do not necessarily account for these significant
   spatial variations. A land-based robot coupled with commercially
   available, relatively low-cost methane detection technology for SMC
   monitoring was field tested at an active MSW landfill. To more
   effectively monitor fugitive methane emissions at MSW landfills, an
   automatic, low-cost, field-deployable technique is needed to actively
   monitor methane concentrations. Three test areas within a landfill were
   selected; SMC surveys were performed both manually and by land-robot
   using the Landtec TDL-500, a tunable diode laser methane detector. The
   preliminary field observations indicate that a robotic platform can
   significantly improve quality in data acquisition for surface methane
   concentrations at MSW landfills; this paper also discusses the
   limitations of land-based robots for site-wide methane emission
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The design processes engineers use to develop artifacts have a
   significant effect on the utility and impact these artifacts have on
   society. Traditional design processes are technology-centric, focusing
   on the artifact being developed with less emphasis on the context,
   culture, and people for whom they are developed. Human-centered design
   processes, however, strive to place the humans who will interact with
   the artifact at the center of the design process. These processes
   require a deep understanding of the stakeholders and a product's context
   of use. One method for obtaining this deep level of understanding is
   design ethnography, a set of methods derived from research methods
   developed within social science and used to understand participants
   preferences and context of use. To date, the limited research on design
   ethnography education has demonstrated that there is a significant gap
   between what novices can produce in their use of design ethnography and
   what is reported in the literature on the use of design ethnography
   within industry. In this paper we interpret the findings of design
   ethnography studies (of both novices and experts) through the lens of
   the Dreyfus and Dreyfus model of skill acquisition. We demonstrate how
   this theory of skill acquisition explains specific results found in the
   literature and the challenge of developing design ethnography as a
   skill. We also discuss the pedagogical implications of this model of
   design ethnography learning and consider Kolb's theory of learning as it
   applies to the development of students as design ethnographers.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the structure, morphology, and chemistry of Mg films that
   were electrodeposited using different electrolytes (magnesium aluminum
   chloride complex (MACC), magnesium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
   (Mg-TFSI) and magnesium triphenoxyaluminate (MTPA)). The microstructure
   and chemistry of the Mg films, along with their overall cycling
   efficiency, showed a strong dependence on electrolyte chloride content.
   The films formed with the higher chloride concentration electrolytes
   (MACC and MTPA) yielded large and columnar grain structures with a
   strong {[}001] texture. The films formed using chloride-free TFSI that
   only has an 80\% cycling efficiency showed much smaller grains and a
   more random texture. Electrochemically conditioned MACC and MTPA also
   led to smaller amounts of impurity being incorporated in the films than
   TFSI. The impurities detected in the form of Mg complexes such as Mg-O,
   Mg-H, Mg-OH, Mg-C, and elemental impurities (O, C, Cl, Al) tend to form
   discontinuous films orthogonal to the {[}001] direction. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{A modified ZSM-5 zeolite (denoted as ZSM-5-M), which was synthesized
   using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and cetyltrimethylammonium
   bromide (CTAB) as dual templates, and the commercial ZSM-5 zeolite
   (denoted as ZSM-5-C), have been used to prepare the corresponding
   CuZSM-5 (M \& C) catalysts containing 3 wt\% Cu by ion exchange method.
   Compared to CuZSM-5-C catalyst, the CuZSM-5-M catalyst demonstrated
   remarkably higher catalytic activity at low temperatures (< 450 degrees
   C) for selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 both in the
   simulated exhaust and engine bench testing. The modified synthesis by
   the dual template with the product aged for a long time at room
   temperature, leads to the formation of the ZSM-5-M zeolite with much
   higher specific surface area (608 m(2) g(-1)) and higher total pore
   volume (0.8880 cm(3) g(-1)) due to the presence of more mesoporous
   pores. The X-ray diffraction results showed that ZSM-5-M maintained its
   typical MFI structure, while its crystallinity (84.1\%) was lower than
   that of the ZSM-5-C zeolite. The characterization results by H2
   temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectra
   revealed that the higher redox properties of isolated Cu2+ ions combined
   with the high-dispersion CuO crystallites and Cu+ ions are likely the
   main cause for the excellent low-temperature activity of the CuZSM-5-M
   catalysts. The isolated active Cu2+ species and high-dispersion CuO
   crystallites had a stronger interaction with other atoms in CuZSM-5-M
   catalysts. The results from thermogravimetric analysis,
   temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and in situ diffuse
   reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy demonstrated that
   ZSM-5-M is a strong Bronsted acid site and the CuZSM-5-M catalyst had a
   relatively higher exchange rate of Cu2+ and Cu+ ions and more Lewis
   acidic sites, giving it a high NH3 adsorption capacity. The strong
   Bronsted acid site might be another cause that results in the higher
   NH3-SCR performance of the CuZSM-5-M catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{A novel high-frequency-AC (HFAC) distributed power delivery system is
   presented in this paper. The target applications of the proposed system
   are the aerial and ground transportation, and renewable energy systems.
   Unlike traditional line-frequency-AC (LFAC) or DC distributed power
   delivery system, the bus frequency of the proposed system can be set at
   tens or hundreds of kilo-Hertz, so as the power transmission frequency.
   As a result, 50 or 60 Hz transformers will be eliminated from the
   system. DC arcing flash will not exist as well with the utilization of
   HFAC bus. In this paper, single-stage isolated bi-directional power
   electronics interfaces are developed which enables distributed AC and DC
   sources or loads to access the main HFAC bus. Soft-switching is also
   realized for all the semiconductor devices in the power electronics
   interface. Distributed control architecture is developed so that each
   source or load can operate independently. Simulation results are
   provided to validate the distributed control architecture. A scaled-down
   hardware demonstration, with the bus specification of 54 kHz and 400
   VAC, is presented to validate the proposed architecture of the HFAC
   distributed power delivery system.}},

Journal = {{INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS}},

Pages = {{1267-1284}},
Abstract = {{Incomplete information systems with missing or unknown data may affect
   the quality of data-driven decision fusion directly. The impact of
   missing data and how much missing data is acceptable for a reliable
   decision-making become more important in the era of big data. This paper
   recommends the rough set theory for the decision fusion of incomplete
   information systems and proposes a new approach to evaluate the impact
   of missing data. According to the connection degree tolerance relation,
   an improved metric called a-classification quality of approximation is
   defined to measure the quality of decision fusion with various identical
   degrees (IDs). Then, the link between the volume of missing data and the
   quality of decision fusion is established. Furthermore, the relaxed
   connection degree tolerance relation is modified to reveal the impact of
   missing data in the classification, which makes the influence of changes
   in the volume of missing data become assessable. Thus, the assessment
   method of missing data is established. The experimental results have
   shown that the quantitative evaluation of missing data in an existing
   information system can be made by the proposed method and the volume of
   acceptable missing data according to a determined quality is possible to
   be predicted in future applications.}},

Abstract = {{The development of a practical magnesium-anode battery requires
   electrolytes that allow for highly efficient magnesium exchange while
   also being compatible with cathode materials. Here, a one-dimensional
   continuum-scale model is developed to simulate cyclic plating/stripping
   voltammetry of a model magnesium-based electrolyte system employing
   magnesium borohydride/dimethoxyethane {[}Mg(BH4)(2)/DME] solutions on a
   gold substrate. The model is developed from non-electroneutral
   dilute-solution theory, using Nernst-Planck equations for the mass flux
   and Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential. The
   electrochemical reaction is modeled with multistep Butler-Volmer
   kinetics, with a modified current/overpotential relationship that
   separately accounts for the portions of the current responsible for
   nucleating new deposits and propagating or dissolving existing ones. The
   diffusivities of the electrolyte species, standard heterogeneous rate
   constant, charge-transfer coefficient, formal potential, and nucleation
   overpotential are determined computationally by reproducing experimental
   voltammograms. The model is computationally inexpensive and therefore
   allows for broad parametric studies of electrolyte behavior that would
   otherwise be impractical. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS. All

Abstract = {{The present work is associated with Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB)
   technology, related to the energy sector. The applications of CFB
   technology span across wide range of areas i.e. boiler, gasifier,
   combustor, dryer, etc. In the present paper, CFD simulations using
   ANSYS-Fluent 14.5 were performed to study the effect of novel swirling
   perforated distributor on fluid dynamics characteristics like pressure
   drop along the riser and distributor, suspension density variations
   along the riser of the Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB). The simulation
   results were also used to compare qualitatively and quantitatively the
   dead-zone formations in the four corners of riser just above the
   distributor plate for swirl and normal distributor plates. The riser
   alongwith distributor was modeled using Pro-E 5.0, and it was meshed in
   ICEM CFD 14.5. Post processing simulations were performed using Fluent
   14.5. 3D CFD simulations were performed on the CFB riser of cross
   section 0.15 m x 0.15 m and height 2.85 m. RNG k-epsilon model was used
   for turbulence modeling. Eulerian model with Syamlal-O'Brien phase
   interaction scheme was used to simulate the two phase flow (air + sand
   mixture flow). RNG k-epsilon model was used for turbulence modeling of
   the flow inside the riser. The RNG turbulence model has a calculation
   for effective viscosity. Modeling and simulations were performed for
   normal perforated distributor plate and results obtained were compared
   with available experimental data. In this way, after validation of
   computational results, further CFD simulations were performed for novel
   geometry of swirl distributor plate. It is observed that suspension
   density (particles' concentration) was more in the middle and upper
   region of the riser in case of swirl distributor plate. However,
   pressure drop across the distributor plate increased in the case of
   novel swirl distributor plate. The objective of significant reduction in
   the dead-zone formation just above the normal distributor plate was
   achieved through novel swirl distributor, which in-turn is expected to
   increase particles' participation in combustion which takes place in
   oxygen rich middle portion of CFB riser and subsequently increases heat
   transfer rate in the CFB riser.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computational investigation aimed at better
   understanding the global structural behavior of a steel-concrete
   composite (SCC) floor system subjected to single-story 1D traveling
   fires. Using the traveling fire methodology (TFM), a range of spatially
   and time-varying fire exposures are applied to a three-dimensional (3D)
   finite element (FE) macro-model of a SCC floor system designed following
   US design standards and practices. The sequentially coupled
   thermal-mechanical simulations were carried out using ABAQUS, where the
   structural modeling approach was verified using experimental test data
   from the Cardington fire test. Essential factors influencing the fire
   resistance of SCC floor systems, namely the passive fire protection
   scheme of the floor beams, and the traveling fire burning size, were
   varied to investigate and characterize the global structural response.
   Simulation results were analyzed and useful trends were observed, in
   particular the dependency of the slab vertical displacement rate and the
   maximum vertical displacement to both the distance from the fire origin
   and traveling fire burning size. Particularly interesting was the
   observation of high tensile forces generated in the beam-to-column
   connections during the heating phase of the traveling fire.}},

Abstract = {{A design tool called Travelling Fires Methodology (TFM) {[}1] has been
   developed in recent years to account for travelling fires in large
   open-plan compartments. However, there has been little research carried
   out to understand the structural response of buildings subjected to such
   fires. The aim of this study is to investigate the behavior of a
   10-story steel frame under travelling fires and compare it to the
   behavior under standard design fires. Each floor of the frame is
   subjected to four travelling fire scenarios and two Eurocode parametric
   temperature-time curves ('short-hot' and `long-cool') using finite
   element software LS-DYNA. In total 60 fire scenarios are considered.
   Results show oscillations of axial forces and bending moments for the
   smallest travelling fire sizes, which are not observed for the
   parametric fires. In general the development of stresses and
   displacements within heated beams is found to follow similar trends
   irrespective of the frame level at which a fire occurs. For the
   investigated frame the critical fire scenarios are found to occur on the
   upper floors of the frame where column sections reduce in size. It has
   been found that depending on the structural metric examined both
   travelling fires and parametric fires can result in the most severe
   scenario. Therefore, it is highlighted that in the structural design for
   fires, in addition to the standard tools it is important to consider
   more realistic fire scenarios associated with travelling fires as they
   might trigger previously unnoticed structural mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the feasibility of photoacoustic PA imaging and
   characterization of bone was investigated. Through the experiments on ex
   vivo bovine femur heads, the optical and ultrasonic penetrations in bone
   which determines the PA detection depth were investigated. Then, the
   feasibility of performing photoacoustic imaging of bone via the raster
   scan of a focused transducer was explored. The images from bovine ribs
   before and after treatment using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
   demonstrate that PA image can reflect the changes in bone microstructure
   as results of the treatment. By performing PA spectral analysis (PASA),
   bone micro-features can be quantitatively assessed, and bone specimens
   before and after EDTA treatment can be differentiated. Moreover, the
   feasibility of assessing the chemical changes in bone specimens by using
   multi-wavelength PA (MWPA) measurement and spectral unmixing method was
   also evaluated. The results quantified from PA measurements verified the
   decreased mineral and blood contents in trabecular bone after the EDTA
   treatment. This study on bovine bones with sizes comparable to human
   bones suggests that PA techniques could contribute to clinical
   management of osteoporosis and other bone diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Plane wave imaging can provide high frame rates and is widely used for
   fast imaging in medical ultrasound. Due to a lack of transmit focus, its
   image quality is usually worse than other ultrasonic imaging modalities,
   such as Synthetic Aperture Ultrasound. In practice, images with high
   contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) are highly desirable as they make it
   possible for the sonographer to detect small cysts with better accuracy.
   In this work, we propose to use edge detection and smoothing filters to
   improve the CNR of cyst images while keeping the point spread function
   unchanged after beamforming. We show that our post-processing technique
   helps achieve CNR larger than 19 dB for cyst images with 75 firing
   angles compounded.}},

Title = {{Emerging investigators series: using an analytical solution approach to
   permit high volume groundwater withdrawals}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{942-952}},
Abstract = {{Sustainable water management is paramount to ensuring continued access
   to fresh water resources. Some states have chosen to use analytical
   solutions to predict pumping-induced drawdowns and the reduction in
   groundwater baseflow to streams in an effort to predict negative impacts
   associated with high volume groundwater withdrawals (HVGWs). In line
   with this approach, the State of Michigan has developed the Water
   Withdrawal Assessment Tool (WWAT), which estimates streamflow depletion
   to evaluate whether a proposed HVGW activity will have an adverse impact
   on stream ecology. To assess the tool's performance, this study compared
   calculations for streamflow depletion estimated using the Hunt (1999)
   solution, as implemented in the WWAT, with those of a numerical
   groundwater flow model developed in MODFLOW for two different locations
   in Michigan where HVGW wells have been permitted. In addition,
   sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were conducted. The results showed
   that the WWAT, in general, provides a conservative estimate of stream
   depletion. However, to obtain a more accurate estimate, the type of
   aquifer (unconfined versus semi-confined) needs to be taken into
   account. The most critical parameters are the storativity, S, and the
   streambed conductance, lambda. Since S has a fixed value of 0.01 in the
   WWAT, the role of streambed conductance becomes paramount. Given the
   paucity of information regarding., its estimation merits additional
   scrutiny.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of electron donors for biological perchlorate removal
   highlights the importance of diverse perchlorate-reducing populations}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated the treatment of a synthetic groundwater with
   approximately 100 mg L-1 perchlorate (ClO4-) and 15 mg L-1 nitrate
   (NO3--N) using a bench-scale, fluidized-bed bioreactor (FBR). The
   groundwater was amended sequentially with acetate and MicroC2000 (TM), a
   proprietary, glycerol-based electron donor. Nitrate reduction to less
   than 0.05 mg L-1 NO3--N and perchlorate removal to less than 0.3 mg L-1
   ClO4- occurred under both electron donor regimes, although a higher
   biomass yield was observed and a higher influent COD concentration was
   required to maintain the same effluent quality when MicroC2000 (TM) was
   used as the electron donor. High-throughput sequencing of partial 16S
   rRNA genes from biomass collected at several time points revealed that a
   single Dechloromonas population dominated the perchlorate-reducing
   community under both electron donors and Dechloromonas species comprised
   greater than 30\% relative abundance of the bacterial community by the
   end of reactor operation. The same Dechloromonas population was abundant
   in two bench-scale systems fed lower perchlorate concentrations,
   although several other perchlorate-reducing bacteria, presumably with
   higher affinities for perchlorate, were also abundant in those systems.
   The results suggest that to reduce perchlorate to levels that allow
   groundwater to serve as a drinking water source, distinct environments
   for diverse perchlorate-reducing bacteria with high and low affinities
   for perchlorate are needed. Such conditions can be created by using two
   bioreactors in series.}},

Title = {{Fate of microplastics and other small anthropogenic litter (SAL) in
   wastewater treatment plants depends on unit processes employed}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1064-1073}},
Abstract = {{The accumulation of microplastics (plastic particles less than 5 mm) and
   similarly sized small anthropogenic litter (SAL; e.g., cellulosic
   products manufactured from natural material) in aquatic ecosystems is a
   growing concern. These particles can serve as vectors of chemical toxins
   and microbial pathogens and thus, as organisms consume them, may lead to
   biomagnification of these contaminants. As collection points in managed
   water systems, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide an
   opportunity to develop and implement novel technologies to manage SAL
   pollution. Here, we assessed the efficiency of different unit processes
   at three WWTPs in removing SAL. Samples were collected from WWTPs that
   employ either secondary treatment (activated sludge) or tertiary
   treatment (granular sand filtration) as a final step, as well as a pilot
   membrane bioreactor system that finishes treatment with microfiltration.
   SAL from 20 mu m to 4.75mm was quantified and categorized by shape. The
   WWTP with secondary treatment removed 95.6\% of SAL, discharging 5.9 SAL
   per L in the final effluent; the plant with tertiary treatment removed
   97.2\% of SAL, discharging 2.6 SAL per L; the membrane bioreactor plant
   removed 99.4\% of SAL, discharging 0.5 SAL per L. The majority of SAL in
   effluent from all plants was comprised of thin fibers (e.g., textile
   fibers). While the WWTP with tertiary granular sand filtration and the
   membrane bioreactor exhibited greater overall removal of SAL, fibers
   represented a larger percentage of SAL in effluent from these plants (79
   and 83\%, respectively) than the plant with activated sludge as a final
   step (44\% fibers). This study suggests that retrofitting existing
   secondary WWTPs with granular sand filtration or membrane filtration
   would result in the highest possible removal of SAL-though treatment
   facilities would continue to serve as pathways of SAL pollution to the
   environment. Further, the fate of the 95-99\% of SAL that is retained or
   leaves WWTPs through means other than effluent (e.g., sludge) must be
   resolved to effectively address this problem.}},

Abstract = {{Self-healing polymers and composites utilizing the Diels-Alder reaction
   have received considerable attention due to the intrinsic healing
   capability of this crosslink. However past research focused on
   chemistries that cleave at low temperatures, which places limitations on
   the polymer's use temperature. Here, it is demonstrated that the
   crosslinking Diels-Alder (DA) reaction between anthracene and maleimide
   moieties can be used to achieve healing efficiencies greater than 94\%
   for polymers and 69\% for carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites
   while remaining stable beyond 240 degrees C. It is shown that the
   self-healing behavior can be obtained purely through the reformation of
   mechanically cleaved DA adducts since the cleaving temperature is beyond
   the decomposition temperature. The self-healing polymer reported here is
   obtained from liquid monomers allowing the polymerization of bulk
   polymer samples and its infusion into continuous fiber reinforced
   composites. It is shown that the polymer can yield thermally stable
   composites with mechanical properties comparable to those of other
   engineering polymers and structural composites.}},

Title = {{Harvesting Energy by Flow Included Motions}},
Booktitle = {{SPRINGER HANDBOOK OF OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{1163-1244}},
Abstract = {{Marine hydrokinetic (MHK) energy is clean, renewable, and available
   worldwide. It comes in two forms: vertical in waves and horizontal in
   currents, tides, and rivers. Apart from a few major ocean currents, most
   of the ocean currents have flow speeds less than 3 kn and most rivers
   have speeds less than 2 kn, making harvesting of their MHK energy by
   steady-lift technologies (turbines) challenging. Horizontal MHK energy
   can also be harnessed using alternating-lift technologies (ALTs). Fish
   utilize alternating lift to propel efficiently in water either as
   individuals or in schools. Engineered structures - bluff bodies, such as
   circular cylinders and prisms, or slender bodies like hydrofoils - may
   generate alternating lift in quasi-steady uniform flows. When these
   structures have scale-relevant flexibility, severe flow-structure
   interaction (FSI) phenomena may be induced. In typical engineering
   applications, FSI phenomena are destructive and, thus, avoided by design
   or suppressed using excessive damping or appendages. If FSI are instead
   enhanced, they may result in vigorous flow-induced motion (FIM) of the
   body, leading to the conversion of MHK energy to potential and kinetic
   energy in a mechanical oscillator. Hydrofoils can harvest MHK energy
   through flutter a well-studied and understood form of instability. On
   the other hand, bluff bodies, such as circular or rectangular
   cross-section cylinders, may exhibit several forms of FIM, individually
   or in schools that have been studied extensively but still are not well
   understood for either suppression or enhancement. Those FIMs are
   vortex-induced vibration (VIV), galloping, buffeting, and gap flow in
   multibody interactions. When enhanced, they convert MHK energy to
   mechanical energy with high-power density (power-to-weight ratio) even
   fromlow-speed horizontal flows. This chapter pre-sents an overview of
   the concepts of ALTs, the underlying physical principles, the available
   experimental and computational methods for studying the relevant FIM,
   the research challenges that have been overcome and those lying ahead,
   field-deployment progress, technology development, and bench marking.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design and control of a support and recovery
   system for use with planar legged robots. The system operates in three
   modes. First, it can be operated in a fully transparent mode where no
   forces are applied to the robot. In this mode, the system follows the
   robot closely to be able to quickly catch the robot if needed. Second,
   it can provide a vertical supportive force to assist a robot during
   operation. Third, it can catch the robot and pull it away from the
   ground after a failure to avoid falls and the associated damages. In
   this mode, the system automatically resets the robot after a trial
   allowing for multiple consecutive trials to be run without manual
   intervention. The supportive forces are applied to the robot through an
   actuated cable and pulley system that uses series elastic actuation with
   a unidirectional spring to enable truly transparent operation. The
   nonlinear nature of this system necessitates careful design of
   controllers to ensure predictable, safe behaviors. In this paper we
   introduce the mechatronic design of the recovery system, develop
   suitable controllers, and evaluate the system's performance on the
   bipedal robot RAMone.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric actuation has potential advantages in autonomous
   microsystems due to relatively high efficiency and low voltage
   requirements when deposited as a thin-film. However, the power available
   to autonomous microsystems may have many restrictions due to electrical
   loading, weight, and size requirements. Modeling of the power sources
   and loads can be beneficial for design and implementation; however,
   understanding the various associated phenomena is important for a valid
   model. This work examines mid-frequency cycled capacitive loading of
   thin film batteries to simulate application to autonomous micro-robots.
   Commercial 50 mu Ah LiCoO2/Lipon thin film batteries were cycled over a
   frequency range between 100Hz-10kHz and at two levels of capacitance (1,
   10nF). Detailed data was acquired of the dynamics of the battery and
   capacitor voltages during switching. The significance of understanding
   losses from switching and leakage at the micro scale is clearly shown.
   The impact of similarity in timescales for various dynamics is
   discussed. Additionally, indications of parasitic capacitance in the
   battery system are seen and discussed. An example implementation of the
   findings in a switching model is presented as well as a simple design
   application example.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of component swapping modularity (CSM) refers to distributed
   control design in networks of smart components such that specific design
   constraints are satisfied. The CSM intends to reduce control design
   effort and complexity in platform-based systems. Existing CSM methods
   achieve promising results for low order multi-input-multi-output (MIMO)
   systems. However, lack of generalization, heavy computational burden,
   and, to a lower extent, the level of designer involvement limit the
   applications of the existing CSM methods. Thus, this paper presents a
   generalized CSM algorithm using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) such
   that almost full automatic control distribution is achieved for an
   arbitrary linear system. The LMI-based CSM is designed to maintain both
   disturbance attenuation and quadratic stability. Also, it is desired to
   satisfy specific time response criteria. Thus, the proposed algorithm
   combines H-2 optimization and robust H-infinity optimization to satisfy
   given design constraints. The designer involvement is dramatically
   reduced to iterative tuning of two scalar parameters in the robust
   H-infinity problem. The proposed algorithm incorporates reference
   tracking. Also, stability measures and design criteria are checked
   numerically at each step. The LMI-based CSM algorithm has been
   numerically verified using an engine idle speed control (ISC) example.}},

Abstract = {{While the move to smaller transistors has been a boon for performance it
   has dramatically increased the cost to fabricate chips using those
   smaller transistors. This forces the vast majority of chip design
   companies to trust a third party-often overseas-to fabricate their
   design. To guard against shipping chips with errors (intentional or
   otherwise) chip design companies rely on post-fabrication testing.
   Unfortunately, this type of testing leaves the door open to malicious
   modifications since attackers can craft attack triggers requiring a
   sequence of unlikely events, which will never be encountered by even the
   most diligent tester.
   In this paper, we show how a fabrication-time attacker can leverage
   analog circuits to create a hardware attack that is small (i.e.,
   requires as little as one gate) and stealthy (i.e., requires an unlikely
   trigger sequence before effecting a chip's functionality). In the open
   spaces of an already placed and routed design, we construct a circuit
   that uses capacitors to siphon charge from nearby wires as they
   transition between digital values. When the capacitors fully charge,
   they deploy an attack that forces a victim flip-flop to a desired value.
   We weaponize this attack into a remotely-controllable privilege
   escalation by attaching the capacitor to a wire controllable and by
   selecting a victim flip-flop that holds the privilege bit for our
   processor. We implement this attack in an OR1200 processor and fabricate
   a chip. Experimental results show that our attacks work, show that our
   attacks elude activation by a diverse set of benchmarks, and suggest
   that our attacks evade known defenses.}},

   spheres, and aspheres. The two-frame PSI extracts modulated phase from
   two randomly phase-shifted interferograms using a Gram-Schmidt
   algorithm, and can work in either null testing or non-null testing
   modes. Experimental results of a paraboloidal mirror suggest that the
   two-frame PSI can achieve comparable measurement precision with
   conventional multi-frame PSI, but has the advantages of faster data
   acquisition speed and less stringent hardware requirements. It
   effectively expands the flexibility of conventional PSI and holds great

   eliminates the violations of the maximum principle that can occur in
   Implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) simulations on the problems on which we have
   tested it. The method has the drawback that it is considerably more
   expensive than IMC for simulations with cold opaque regions. We discuss

Abstract = {{Implicit Monte Carlo simulations of thermal radiative transport can
   exhibit what is known as teleportation error in problems with strong
   coupling between radiation and matter. Teleportation error occurs when
   energy deposited in a localized region of a spatial zone is emitted
   throughout the zone in the next time step. Teleportation error is
   commonly reduced by biasing the positions of photon thermal emission
   using a fit to the spatial distribution of temperature to the fourth
   power. The current work samples and stores locations along photon paths
   based on absorption probabilities. These locations are used as sites for
   emission in the subsequent time step. This method of teleportation
   correction is demonstrated in several sample problems, and is validated
   against an Implicit Monte Carlo Diffusion Method, which does not exhibit
   teleportation error. The new method reduces teleportation error relative
   to the source tilting method, and enables the use of lower spatial
   resolutions than would be required to mitigate teleportation error using
   the source tilting method.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{17225-17235}},
Abstract = {{Cu2Se is a p-type semiconducting compound that possesses excellent
   thermoelectric properties but degrades at elevated temperatures under
   large currents, precluding it from applications in harvesting waste
   heat. In this study, we make use of a doping approach to attempt to
   chemically stabilize Cu2Se while maintaining its superior thermoelectric
   properties. Specifically, we synthesized Cu2(1-x)SnxSe (x = 0, 0.01,
   0.02 and 0.05) via melting, annealing and spark plasma sintering. We
   found that the ZT was enhanced the most in the x = 0.01 sample,
   averaging approximately a 15\% increase over the pure Cu2Se throughout a
   broad temperature range of 473-823 K, and achieving a maximum ZT = 1 at
   T = 823 K. The enhancement is due to an increased power factor and a
   reduced thermal conductivity, which is a result of point defect
   scattering from Sn atoms in the Cu2Se matrix and grain boundary
   scattering from a micron-size secondary phase of SnSe. We further tested
   the ability of the Sn dopant to prevent material degradation at elevated
   temperatures under large currents. Increasing the Sn dopant content does
   indeed decrease the solid Cu precipitation but not enough to resolve the
   issue of material degradation. As a result, despite its improved ZT,
   Cu1.98Sn0.01Se is not yet ready for thermoelectric applications, and
   requires further effort to stabilize the structure.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL FIRE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{114-125}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Spray-applied fire-resistive materials (SFRMs) are the most
   commonly used passive fire protection for steel structure in the USA.
   However, they are often called into question because of their poor
   durability (cohesive and adhesive) performance. Being an inherently
   brittle material with low tensile strength, SFRM tends to dislodge and
   delaminate under extreme loads and service loads. Such loss of fire
   protection greatly endangers the steel structures, especially under
   multi-hazards like post-earthquake/impact fires. The purpose of this
   paper is to introduce a new technology of a ductile cement-based SFRM,
   namely, spray-applied fire-resistive engineered cementitious composite
   (SFR-ECC) that overcomes the aforementioned problems and contributes
   toward enhanced fire safety of steel structures.
   Design/methodology/approach - SFR-ECC has been developed as a durable
   alternative to conventional SFRM by adopting engineered cementitious
   composite (ECC) technology in the material design process. Various
   experimental studies have also been conducted to fully evaluate the
   performance of SFR- ECC.
   Findings - It is found that SFR- ECC possesses much better durability
   performance under both static and high-rate loading compared to
   conventional SFRMs. With many unique properties, applications of SFR-
   ECC for pre-fabrication of passive fire protection are also found to be
   feasible.
   Originality/value - This paper is a comprehensive introduction of the
   newly developed SFR- ECC. It summarizes the key properties of SFR- ECC
   and provides a useful guideline for further investigation and field
   application of SFR- ECC.}},

Abstract = {{Glass is a hard-to-machine material with vast industrial application.
   Electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) is a non-traditional
   machining technology that has shown potential for effective glass
   machining. However, ECDM has not been widely used in industry despite
   being studied for over a decade. Major challenges of ECDM include
   limited machinable depth and low material removal rate. In this paper,
   an innovative hybrid machining process combining ECDM and traditional
   cutting is presented, namely electrochemical discharge assisted cutting.
   The material removal rate of the hybrid ECDM process is significantly
   higher than conventional processes. Experimental results are presented
   to prove the feasibility and capability of the process. Discussion
   concentrates on the improvement of geometric accuracy and surface
   integrity through experimentation.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing biopsy length could reduce the false negative rate in
   prostate biopsy diagnosis. In this paper, the effect of magnetic
   abrasive finishing (MAF) of needle inner surface on inner friction force
   and biopsy length was investigated. The test was conducted using the
   tissue-mimicking material polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and chicken breast.
   The inner friction forces of MAF-polished and unpolished needles were
   measured. In the PVC phantom, the smoothly polished needle had lowest
   inner friction force (0.0024 N/mm) and longest biopsy sample (34.3 mm).
   Although the roughly polished needle had a smoother surface than the
   unpolished needle, the significance of the effects on the biopsy
   performance due to the slight improvement of the needle surface was not
   observed. The biopsy tests with chicken breast tissue showed the trends
   similar to the case with PVC phantom. The smoothly polished needle had
   the smallest inner friction force (0.024 N/mm) and the longest biopsy
   sample (9.6 mm). These results showed that lowering the friction force
   between the needle and tissue facilitates the sliding of tissue along
   the needle, leading to a long biopsy sample. MAF can reduce the friction
   at the needle tissue interface and obtaining longer biopsy samples.}},

   with low wavenumber extraction (BBGFL) to fast modeling of the radiated
   emissions from power structures of printed circuit boards (PCBs) for
   electromagnetic interference/compatibility (EMI/ENIC) analysis. We use
   the BBGFL. to compute the Green's function over broadband frequencies
   along the boundary walls of arbitrarily shaped power/ground planes. The
   broadband Green's function is based on modal expansions with low
   wavenumber extraction. Because the modal expressions are independent of
   frequencies, they are computed once and used for all frequencies. Then
   the radiated fields arc readily derived from the fields on boundary
   walls using the equivalent principle. The accuracy and computational
   efficiency of the present method are compared with the method of moment
   (MoM) and commercial tool HFSS. The results of radiated emission of
   BBGFL are in good agreement with MOM and HESS. But the method of BBGFL
   is several hundred times faster than direct MoM and HFSS for broadband

   proposes a trajectory program approach to accomplish the

   multiple phases. During each phase, only two of the three craft are
   charged. In this way the relative trajectory of the charged spacecraft
   during a certain phase is a conic section. The entire trajectories are
   composed of patched conics and/or straight lines. The procedures
   determining the three-phase maneuver strategy is developed, including a
   preadjusting phase and two transition phases. Numerical simulations
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and the elegance of the

Abstract = {{While feedback control can be used to cause a motorized device to render
   the dynamic behavior of a virtual environment, this capacity inevitably
   breaks down at high frequencies where the rendered impedance reverts to
   the impedance of the device hardware. This situation amounts to a
   disadvantage for admittance display, for which hardware impedance is
   high. Series elastic actuators offer an attractive alternative with
   lower impedance at high frequencies, though stability considerations
   impose limits on the stiffest virtual environment that may be rendered.
   In this paper we explore the tradeoffs between admittance control and
   series elastic actuation with the use of analytical comparisons in the
   frequency domain backed up by experiments and complemented with a
   passivity analysis that accounts for an excess of passivity contributed
   by human biomechanics.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of MIMO radar has been a subject of intense study in the
   past decades. For such a system, however, the important phenomenon of
   phase transition has received little attention in the literature. In
   this paper, we study the phase transition on the target detection
   probability of a SNR maximizing detector. Such a detector declares a
   target to be present when the largest eigenvalue of the observed data
   matrix exceeds a threshold. In particular, we identify a critical value
   below and above which the limiting detection performance is described by
   the Tracy-Widom law and the Gaussian law, respectively. Under both laws,
   the scaling limits and asymptotic expansions of misdetection probability
   at the vanishing regime are derived using tools from random matrix

Abstract = {{Purpose: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can
   differentiate osteogenic lineages, but their tissue regeneration ability
   is inconsistent. The bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMC) fraction of
   adult bone marrow contains a variety of progenitor cells that may
   potentiate tissue regeneration. This study examined the utility of BMMC,
   both alone and in combination with purified MSC, as a cell source for
   bone regeneration. Methods: Fresh BMMC, culture-expanded MSC, and a
   combination of BMMC and MSC were encapsulated in collagen-chitosan
   hydrogel microbeads for pre-culture and minimally invasive delivery.
   Microbeads were cultured in growth medium for 3 days, and then in either
   growth or osteogenic medium for 17 days prior to subcutaneous injection
   in the rat dorsum. Results: MSC remained viable in microbeads over 17
   days in pre-culture, while some of the BMMC fraction were nonviable.
   After 5 weeks of implantation, microCT and histology showed that
   supplementation of BMMC with MSC produced a strong synergistic effect on
   the volume of ectopic bone formation, compared to either cell source
   alone. Microbeads containing only fresh BMMC or only cultured MSC
   maintained in osteogenic medium resulted in more bone formation than
   their counterparts cultured in growth medium. Histological staining
   showed evidence of residual microbead matrix in undifferentiated samples
   and indications of more advanced tissue remodeling in differentiated
   samples. Conclusions: These data suggest that components of the BMMC
   fraction can act synergistically with predifferentiated MSC to
   potentiate ectopic bone formation. The microbead system may have utility
   in delivering desired cell populations in bone regeneration
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures rank among the most prevalent
   and costly sports-related injuries. Current tendon grafts used for ACL
   reconstruction are limited by suboptimal biomechanical properties. We
   have addressed these issues by engineering multiphasic boneligament-bone
   (BLB) constructs that develop structural and mechanical properties
   similar to native ACL. The purpose of this study was to examine the
   acute remodeling process that occurs as the BLB grafts advance toward
   the adult ligament phenotype in vivo. Thus, we implanted BLB constructs
   fabricated from male cells into female host sheep and allowed 3, 7, 14,
   or 28 days (n = 4 at each time point) for recovery. To address whether
   or not graft-derived cells were even necessary, a subset of BLB
   constructs (n = 3) were acellularized, implanted, and allowed 28 days
   for recovery. At each recovery time point, the following histological
   analyses were performed: picrosirius red staining to assess collagen
   alignment and immunohistochemistry to assess both graft development and
   host immune response. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis,
   performed on every explanted BLB, was used to detect the presence of
   graft-derived male cells remaining in the constructs and/or migration
   into surrounding host tissue. The analysis of the PCR and histology
   samples revealed a rapid migration of host-derived macrophages and
   neutrophils into the graft at 3 days, followed by increased collagen
   density and alignment, vascularization, innervation, and near complete
   repopulation of the graft with host cells within 28 days. This study
   provides a greater understanding of the processes of ligament
   regeneration in our BLB constructs as they remodel toward the adult
   ligament phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{On-chip supply boosting can quickly restore a microprocessor core's
   power rail from near-threshold to super-threshold when critical code
   sections are encountered. We demonstrate a flip-chip implementation of a
   supply boosting technique, called Shortstop, which uses a transient
   supply rail and leverages the parasitic and intentional inductance of a
   package. To address package parasitic variation, an automatic tuning
   algorithm is shown. A 7.9mm(2), 40nm CMOS prototype chip is attached to
   a custom ball grid array substrate, with integrated in-package
   inductors. Shortstop boosts a 2.7mm(2) core from 0.5V to 0.75V in 14ns
   with only 27mV of droop on a shared 0.8V supply rail, marking a 57\%
   faster transition with 67\% lower supply noise than a dual-supply PMOS

   Augmentation and Periodontal Regeneration Applications}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{To ensure a successful dental implant therapy, the presence of adequate
   vertical and horizontal alveolar bone is fundamental. However, an
   insufficient amount of alveolar ridge in both dimensions is often
   encountered in dental practice due to the consequences of oral diseases
   and tooth loss. Although postextraction socket preservation has been
   adopted to lessen the need for such invasive approaches, it utilizes
   bone grafting materials, which have limitations that could negatively
   affect the quality of bone formation. To overcome the drawbacks of
   routinely employed grafting materials, bone graft substitutes such as 3D
   scaffolds have been recently investigated in the dental field. In this
   review, we highlight different biomaterials suitable for 3D scaffold
   fabrication, with a focus on ``3D-printed{''} ones as bone graft
   substitutes that might be convenient for various applications related to
   implant therapy. We also briefly discuss their possible adoption for
   periodontal regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{In a klystron, charge overtaking of electrons leads to an infinity of AC
   current. The harmonic content therein can be calculated exactly, with or
   without space charge effects. This paper extends the klystron theory to
   a traveling wave tube (TWT). We assume that the electron motion is
   described by linear theory. The crowding of these linear orbits may lead
   to harmonic generation, as in a klystron. We calculate the buildup of
   harmonic content as a function of distance from the input, and compare
   these analytic results with the CHRISTINE code. Reasonable agreement was
   found. A dimensionless ``bunching parameter{''} for TWT, X = root 2P(in)
   / (PbC), is identified, which characterizes the harmonic content in the
   AC current, where Pin is the power of the input signal, P-b is the DC
   beam power, and C is Pierce's gain parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Using the Briggs-Bers criterion, we find that the lower band edge of
   linear beam TWTs is not subjected to absolute instability. At the upper
   band edge, we find a threshold beam current beyond which absolute
   instability is excited. In general, an absolute instability would occur
   in a linear beam tube if the cold-tube circuit dispersion curve in the
   frequency-wavenumber (omega-k) plane is locally convex and would not
   occur if the cold-circuit dispersion curve is locally concave, whenever
   the group velocity of the circuit mode is in the same direction as the
   beam mode. These results are used to examine the recent studies on the
   start current of a Smith-Purcell source.}},

   performance of Automated Vehicles before they are produced and deployed.
   Under naturalistic driving conditions, field operational tests and
   simulations may take a long time to finish, because of the low exposure
   to safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we propose an accelerated
   evaluation approach. Statistics of the motion of the primary other
   vehicle (POV) were built using extracted naturalistic driving data then
   modified to present higher risk interactions. Two surrogate automated
   vehicles obtained from observed production vehicle behaviors were
   evaluated in car-following scenarios. Results show that the proposed
   method can accelerate the evaluation process by 5 orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Social behaviors and choices spread through interactions and may lead to
   a cascading behavior. Understanding how such social cascades spread in a
   network is crucial for many applications ranging from viral marketing to
   political campaigns. The behavior of cascade depends crucially on the
   model of cascade or social influence and the topological structure of
   the social network.
   In this paper we study the general threshold model of cascades which are
   parameterized by a distribution over the natural numbers, in which the
   collective influence from infected neighbors, once beyond the threshold
   of an individual u, will trigger the infection of u. By varying the
   choice of the distribution, the general threshold model can model
   cascades with and without the submodular property. In fact, the general
   threshold model captures many previously studied cascade models as
   special cases, including the independent cascade model, the linear
   threshold model, and k-complex contagions.
   We provide both analytical and experimental results for how cascades
   from a general threshold model spread in a general growing network
   model, which contains preferential attachment models as special cases.
   We show that if we choose the initial seeds as the early arriving nodes,
   the contagion can spread to a good fraction of the network and this
   fraction crucially depends on the fixed points of a function derived
   only from the specified distribution. We also show, using a coauthorship
   network derived from DBLP databases and the Stanford web network, that
   our theoretical results can be used to predict the infection rate up to
   a decent degree of accuracy, while the configuration model does the job
   poorly.}},

Abstract = {{Credit networks provide a flexible model of distributed trust, which
   supports transactions between untrusted counterparties through paths of
   intermediaries. We extend this model by introducing interest rates
   (prices on lines of credit), both as a means to incentivize credit
   issuance and to provide a framework for modeling networks of financial
   relationships. Including interest rates poses a new constraint on
   transactions, as intermediaries will route payments only if the interest
   received covers any interest paid. We account for these constraints in
   an efficient algorithm for finding the maximum transaction flow between
   two agents in a financial network. There are generally many feasible
   payment paths serving a given transaction, and we show that the policy
   for selecting among such paths can have a substantial effect on
   liquidity, as measured by steady-state probability of transaction
   success. Finally, we consider the situation where the transaction source
   can choose among heuristic path selection mechanisms, in order to
   maximize their payoff. Through empirical game-theoretic analysis, we
   find that routing is inefficient due to the positive externality of
   choices promoting network liquidity. However, agent choices do reflect
   some consideration of overall network liquidity, in addition to their
   own interest payments.}},

Abstract = {{Sybil attacks, in which an adversary creates a large number of
   identities, present a formidable problem for the robustness of
   recommendation systems. One promising method of sybil detection is to
   use data from social network ties to implicitly infer trust.
   Previous work along this dimension typically a) assumes that it is
   difficult/costly for an adversary to create edges to honest nodes in the
   network; and b) limits the amount of damage done per such edge, using
   conductance-based methods. However, these methods fail to detect a
   simple class of sybil attacks which have been identified in online
   systems. Indeed, conductance-based methods seem inherently unable to do
   so, as they are based on the assumption that creating many edges to
   honest nodes is difficult, which seems to fail in real-world settings.
   We create a sybil defense system that accounts for the adversary's
   ability to launch such attacks yet provably withstands them by:
   (1) Not assuming any restriction on the number of edges an adversary can
   form, but instead making a much weaker assumption that creating edges
   from sybils to most honest nodes is difficult, yet allowing that the
   remaining nodes can be freely connected to.
   (2) Relaxing the goal from classifying all nodes as honest or sybil to
   the goal of classifying the ``core{''} nodes of the network as honest;
   and classifying no sybil nodes as honest.
   (3) Exploiting a new, for sybil detection, social network property,
   namely, that nodes can be embedded in low-dimensional spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Analysts predict impending shortages in the health care workforce, yet
   wages for health care workers already account for over half of U.S.

   health workforce planning in a large health system for a single worker
   class; e.g., nurses. We give a series of common-sense conditions that
   any system of this kind should satisfy and use them to prove the
   optimality of a natural lookahead policy. We then use real-world data to
   examine how such policies perform in more complex systems; in
   particular, our experiments show that a natural extension of the

   hydrogels with fast self-healing ability by simply oxidizing a mixture
   of gelatin and dopamine under metal-free conditions. These injectable
   hydrogels autonomously self-healed immediately when coming into contact

   recovery after 80\% compression, simple reformability, good adhesiveness

   also investigated, and demonstrated that the hydrogel network was
   crosslinked by both supramolecular and covalent bonds endowing the
   hydrogel with self-healing and recovery properties, and enabling the

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as a reliable, low-cost
   alternative to the traditional wired sensing paradigm. While such
   networks have made significant progress in the field of structural
   monitoring, significantly less development has occurred for feedback
   control applications. Previous work in WSNs for feedback control has
   highlighted many of the challenges of using this technology including
   latency in the wireless communication channel and computational
   inundation at the individual sensing nodes. This work seeks to overcome
   some of those challenges by drawing inspiration from the real-time
   sensing and control techniques employed by the biological central
   nervous system and in particular the mammalian cochlea. A novel
   bio-inspired wireless sensor node was developed that employs analog
   filtering techniques to perform time-frequency decomposition of a sensor
   signal, thus encompassing the functionality of the cochlea. The node
   then utilizes asynchronous sampling of the filtered signal to compress
   the signal prior to communication. This bio-inspired sensing
   architecture is extended to a feedback control application in order to
   overcome the traditional challenges currently faced by wireless control.
   In doing this, however, the network experiences high bandwidths of
   low-significance information exchange between nodes, resulting in some
   lost data. This study considers the impact of this lost data on the
   control capabilities of the bio-inspired control architecture and finds
   that it does not significantly impact the effectiveness of control.}},

Title = {{Optical anisotropy and sign reversal in layer-by-layer assembled films
   from chiral nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{191}},
Pages = {{141-157}},
Abstract = {{Chiral anisotropy and related optical effects at the nanoscale represent
   some of the most dynamic areas of nanomaterials today. Translation of
   optical activity of chiral semiconductor and metallic nanoparticles
   (NPs) into optoelectronic devices requires preparation of thin films
   from chiral NPs on both flat and curved surfaces. In this paper we
   demonstrate that chiral NP films can be made via layer-by-layer assembly
   (LBL) using negatively charged chiral CdS NPs, stabilized by D-and
   L-cysteine and positively charged polyelectrolytes, as building blocks.
   LBL coatings from NPs combine simplicity of preparation and strong
   optical activity. Circular extinction measurements using circular
   dichroism instruments indicate that the film possess four chiroptical
   bands at 280, 320, 350, and 390 nm. The latter two bands at 390 and 350
   nm are associated with the band gap transitions (chiral excitons), while
   the former two are attributed to transitions involving surface ligands.
   When NPs are assembled in LBL films, the rotatory activity and the sign
   for circular extinction associated with the electronic transition in the
   inorganic core of the NPs is conserved. However, this is not true for
   circular extinction bands at short wavelengths: the sign of the rotatory
   optical activity is reversed. This effect is attributed to the change of
   the conformation of surface ligands in the polyelectrolyte matrix, which
   was confirmed both by semi-empirical and density functional (DFT)
   quantum mechanical calculations. Circular dichroism spectra calculated
   using a DFT algorithm closely match the experimental spectra of CdS NPs.
   These findings indicate that the spectroscopic methods sensitive to
   chirality of the surface ligands can be used to investigate fine
   structural changes in the surface layer of nanocolloids. Strong rotatory
   optical activity of nanostructured semiconductor films opens the
   possibilities for new polarization-based optical devices.}},

   self-organization}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{38}},
Pages = {{16894-16901}},
Abstract = {{The formation of microvascular networks plays essential roles in
   regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Nevertheless, the
   self-organization mechanisms underlying the dynamic morphogenic process
   are poorly understood due to a paucity of effective tools for mapping
   the spatiotemporal dynamics of single cell behaviors. By establishing a
   single cell nanobiosensor along with live cell imaging, we perform
   dynamic single cell analysis of the morphology, displacement, and gene
   expression during microvascular self-organization. Dynamic single cell
   analysis reveals that endothelial cells self-organize into
   subpopulations with specialized phenotypes to form microvascular
   networks and identifies the involvement of Notch1-Dll4 signaling in
   regulating the cell subpopulations. The cell phenotype correlates with
   the initial Dll4 mRNA expression level and each subpopulation displays a
   unique dynamic Dll4 mRNA expression profile. Pharmacological
   perturbations and RNA interference of Notch1-Dll4 signaling modulate the
   cell subpopulations and modify the morphology of the microvascular
   network. Taken together, a nanobiosensor enables a dynamic single cell
   analysis approach underscoring the importance of Notch1-Dll4 signaling
   in microvascular self-organization.}},

Abstract = {{We present an add-on scheme for multi-input, multi-output systems with a
   nominal controller in order to avoid problems caused by amplitude and
   rate saturation such as integrator windup and phase lag. No modelling
   information is needed except the number of input and output. The
   adaptive error correction estimates the effect of control saturation on
   the command following error and directly modify the command following
   error that is input to the nominal controller in order to prevent
   further saturation. A retrospective cost optimization algorithm is
   applied to obtain the correction on-line based on measurements of the
   command following error and the amount of control saturation. Different
   from anti-windup scheme, which compensates the control command to
   enlarge the convergence region, this scheme intends to adaptively
   contain the error inside the convergence region provided by the nominal
   controller. Numerical examples show that, together with fixed-gain
   proportional-integral type controller, the adaptive error correction
   scheme can prevent integrator windup and phase lag for asymptotically
   stable plant and critically stable plant in the presence of amplitude

Abstract = {{The computational modeling of soot in aircraft engines is a formidable
   challenge, not only due to the multi-scale interactions with the
   turbulent combustion process but the equally complex physical and
   chemical processes that drive the conversion of gas-phase fuel molecules
   into solid-phase particles. In particular, soot formation is highly
   sensitive to the gas phase composition and temporal fluctuations in a
   turbulent background flow. In this work, a large eddy simulation (LES)
   framework is used to study soot formation in a model aircraft combustor
   with swirl-based fuel and air injection: Two different configurations
   are simulated one with and one without secondary oxidation jets.
   Specific attention is paid to the LES numerical implementation such that
   the discrete solver minimizes the dissipation of kinetic energy.
   Simulation of the model combustor shows that the LES approach captures
   the two recirculation zones necessary for flame stabilization very
   accurately. Further the model reasonably predicts the temperature
   profiles inside the combustor. The model also captures variation in soot
   volume fraction with global equivalence ratio. The structure of the soot
   field suggests that when secondary oxidation jets are present, the inner
   recirculation region becomes fuel lean and soot generation is completely
   suppressed. Further, the soot field is highly intermittent suggesting
   that a very restrictive set of gas phase conditions promote soot
   generation.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for generating reduced order models (ROMs) of bladed disks
   with small geometric mistuning is proposed. Discrepancies in structural
   properties (mistuning) from blade to blade can cause a significant
   increase in the maximum vibratory stress. The effects of mistuning have
   been studied over the past few decades. Many researchers have studied
   the dynamic behavior of mistuned bladed disks by using ROMs. Many of
   these techniques rely on the fact that the modes of a mistuned system
   can be approximated by a linear combination of modes of the
   corresponding tuned system. Also, the tuned system modes have been
   modeled in component mode mistuning by using modal participation factors
   of cantilevered blade modes. Such techniques assume that mistuning can
   be well modeled as variations in blade alone frequencies. However, since
   geometric deformations contain stiffness and mass variations, mistuning
   can no longer be captured by cantilevered blade modes alone. To address
   this, a new technique is presented for generating ROMs of bladed disks
   with small geometric mistuning which may be a more general case of
   mistuning in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Mistuning commonly refers to non-cyclically symmetric variations in such
   an otherwise cyclically-symmetric structure. Mistuning in a blisk due to
   variations in blade materials and geometry have been studied extensively
   and are known to have a significant impact on the forced response of
   blisks. However, mistuning can also arise due to variations at contact
   interfaces within a blisk with friction damping mechanisms such as under
   platform dampers or shrouds. Past literature analyzing the effect of
   this source of contact mistuning is limited, particularly by the use of
   lumped or single-node contacts at each sector to shorten analysis times.
   In this paper, we aim to better understand the specific effects of
   parameter variations across contact interfaces on an otherwise tuned
   blisk. A blisk with shroud to shroud contacts is considered. Accurate
   representation of microslip phenomena are incorporated in the analysis
   by modeling multiple localized node to node contact models at contact
   surfaces on each blisk sector. Contact stiffnesses which dictate the
   friction damping dynamics of the shrouds are chosen as the mistuning
   parameters. The harmonic balance method is used to solve for forced
   responses. We analyze cases with random patterns of contact stiffnesses
   in different microslip regimes in the proximity of different modal
   regions. Probabilistic analysis of nonlinear contact responses are
   carried out close to a linear region where comparatively high
   amplification factors are observed. Statistics are also developed for
   linear cases and compared with the nonlinear case to qualify the
   dependence of amplification factors of nonlinear forced responses on the
   level of microslip and on the variance of contact parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In operation, rotating bladed disks (blisks) are often subject to high
   levels of dynamic loading, resulting in large amplitudes of forced
   vibrations especially at resonance. Moreover, variations in structural
   properties of individual sectors, referred to as mistuning, can lead to
   strain energy localization and can amplify forced responses. To prevent
   damages caused by high cycle fatigue, various frictional damping sources
   are introduced to dissipate vibration energy. Due to the nonlinear
   behavior of frictional contacts, conventional methods to study the
   dynamics of the blisk-damper systems are based often on numerical time
   integration, which is time-consuming and can be computationally
   prohibitive due to the large sizes of commercial blisk models. Existing
   techniques for model reduction either rely heavily on cyclic symmetry of
   the blisk-damper system, or are based on component mode synthesis (CMS).
   However, in the presence of mistuning, cyclic symmetry no longer exists.
   Also, mistuning is random and best studied statistically. Repetitive CMS
   condensation for a large amount of random mistuning patterns can lead to
   a computationally formidable task.
   This paper presents a reduced-order modeling technique to efficiently
   capture the nonlinear dynamic responses of blisk-damper systems with
   both small perturbations in blade material properties (small mistuning),
   and significant changes in the blisk geometries (large mistuning). The
   reduced-order models (ROMs) are formed by projecting the blisk-damper
   systems onto a novel mode basis that mimics the contact behavior. This
   mode basis contains normal mode shapes of the mistuned blisk-damper
   systems with either sliding or sticking conditions enforced on the
   contact surfaces. These mode shapes are computed through the N-PRIME
   method, a technique recently developed by the authors to efficiently
   obtain mode shapes for blisks with simultaneous large and small
   mistuning. The resulting modal nonlinear equations of motion are solved
   by a hybrid frequency/time (HFT) domain method with continuation. In the
   HFT method, the contact status and friction forces are determined in the
   time domain by a quasi -two-dimensional contact model at each contact
   point, whereas the modal equations of motion are solved in the frequency
   domain according to a harmonic balance formulation. The forced responses
   computed by the proposed ROMs are validated for two systems with
   distinct mistuning patterns. A statistical analysis is performed to
   study the effectiveness of the frictional dampers under random mistuning
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{We study a class of discontinuous vector fields brought to our attention
   by multilegged animal locomotion. Such vector fields arise not only in
   biomechanics, but also in robotics, neuroscience, and electrical
   engineering, to name a few domains of application. Under the conditions
   that (i) the vector field's discontinuities are locally confined to a
   finite number of smooth submanifolds and (ii) the vector field is
   transverse to these surfaces in an appropriate sense, it is known that
   the vector field yields a well-defined flow that is Lipschitz
   continuous. We extend these results by showing this flow is
   piecewise-differentiable, so that it admits a first-order approximation
   (known as a Bouligand derivative) that is piecewise-linear and
   continuous at every point. We exploit this first-order approximation to
   infer existence of piecewise-differentiable impact maps (including
   Poincare maps for periodic orbits), show that the flow is locally
   conjugate (via a piecewise- differentiable homeomorphism) to a flowbox,
   and assess the effect of perturbations (both infinitesimal and
   non-infinitesimal) on the flow. We use these results to give a
   sufficient condition for the exponential stability of a periodic orbit
   passing through a point of multiply intersecting events and apply the
   theory in illustrative examples to demonstrate synchronization in first-
   and second-order phase oscillator models abstracted from the legged
   locomotion application domain that motivated our interest in this class
   of models.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{We describe a systematic coarse-graining method to study crystallization
   and predict possible polymorphs of small organic molecules. In this
   method, a coarse-grained (CG) force field is obtained by
   inverse-Boltzmann iteration from the radial distribution function of
   atomistic simulations of the known crystal. With the force field
   obtained by this method, we show that CG simulations of the drug
   phenytoin predict growth of a crystalline slab from a melt of phenytoin,
   allowing determination of the fastest-growing surface, as well as giving
   the correct lattice parameters and crystal morphology. By applying
   meta-dynamics to the coarse-grained model, a new crystalline form of
   phenytoin (monoclinic, space group P2(1)) was predicted which is
   different from the experimentally known crystal structure (orthorhombic,
   space group Pna2(1)). Atomistic simulations and quantum calculations
   then showed the polymorph to be meta-stable at ambient temperature and
   pressure, and thermodynamically more stable than the conventional
   orthorhombic crystal at high pressure. The results suggest an efficient
   route to study crystal growth of small organic molecules that could also
   be useful for identification of possible polymorphs as well.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{36}},
Pages = {{13949-13956}},
Abstract = {{A high thermoelectric performance has been achieved in half-Heusler
   alloys of composition MNiSn (M-Ti, Zr, Hf). The enhanced properties are
   attributed to the formation of microscale Ti-rich and Ti-poor grains.
   The mechanism of phase separation remains unclear, as the composition
   and microstructure of the grains are highly dependent upon synthesis
   conditions. This work uses first principles density functional theory,
   combined with the cluster expansion method, to calculate a thermodynamic
   phase diagram of the full pseudo-ternary (Hf1-x-yZrxTiy) NiSn system.
   The results show that ZrNiSn and HfNiSn are fully miscible at all
   temperatures, and that a miscibility gap between (Zr, Hf) NiSn and
   TiNiSn exists at temperatures below 850 K. For temperatures above 850 K,
   a solid solution is found to minimize the free energy. The low critical
   temperature of 850 K challenges the prevailing interpretation that the
   microstructure is created by an intrinsic phase separation mechanism,
   such as spinodal decomposition. Calculated migration barriers for Ti,
   Zr, and Hf atoms show that Ti-rich and Ti-poor grains may be
   non-equilibrium states that are kinetically trapped after
   solidification.}},

Abstract = {{The current work presents a simplified flow loss model of centrifugal
   compressor casing flow. The model can be used to estimate the flow
   losses and air flow rate through the casing under arbitrary casing
   geometry definitions. Numerical simulations of a turbocharger
   centrifugal compressor are presented and experimentally validated, with
   excellent agreement between the model and experimental data. The.
   numerical results were used to investigate the different casing flow
   loss mechanisms, and the major sources of flow loss in the casing were
   identified. The simulations indicate the casing flow losses are due to a
   combination of dividing flow loss, expansion flow loss and friction
   loss. The dividing flow loss, caused by a portion of the main flow
   entering the casing slot, is the major source of flow loss, while the
   expansion flow loss, caused by the expansion flow returning from the
   slot to the casing cavity, is the second most important source of flow
   loss. By simplifying the casing into a 2-D configuration, the flow loss
   coefficient k in the dividing flow and expansion flow is simplified as a
   function of the casing geometric parameters and dividing flow loss and
   expansion flow loss models are developed and numerically validated. The
   results of this work are a valuable new tool to rapidly evaluate casing

Title = {{Coordination of signaling and tissue mechanics during morphogenesis of

Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{918-928}},
Abstract = {{Efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients by the intestine
   requires a very large apical surface area, a feature that is enhanced by
   the presence of villi, fingerlike epithelial projections that extend
   into the lumen. Prior to villus formation, the epithelium is a thick
   pseudostratified layer. In mice, villus formation begins at embryonic
   day (E)14.5, when clusters of mesenchymal cells form just beneath the
   thick epithelium. At this time, analysis of the flat lumenal surface
   reveals a regular pattern of short apical membrane invaginations that
   form in regions of the epithelium that lie in between the mesenchymal
   clusters. Apical invaginations begin in the proximal intestine and
   spread distally, deepening with time. Interestingly, mitotically rounded
   cells are frequently associated with these invaginations. These mitotic
   cells are located at the tips of the invaginating membrane (internalized
   within the epithelium), rather than adjacent to the apical surface.
   Further investigation of epithelial changes during membrane invagination
   reveals that epithelial cells located between mesenchymal clusters
   experience a circumferential compression, as epithelial cells above each
   cluster shorten and widen. Using a computational model, we examined
   whether such forces are sufficient to cause apical invaginations.
   Simulations and in vivo data reveal that proper apical membrane
   invagination involves intraepithelial compressive forces, mitotic cell
   rounding in the compressed regions and apico-basal contraction of the
   dividing cell. Together, these data establish a new model that explains
   how signaling events intersect with tissue forces to pattern apical
   membrane invaginations that define the villus boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{This simulation study discusses the application of a multimode
   combustion engine in a mild hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with three-way
   catalytic converter (TWC). Operation in the lean combustion mode
   homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) results in oxidation of
   the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of the TWC. Thereby, the TWC's ability
   to convert, NOx under lean conditions is removed. Succeeding depletion
   of the OSC under rich spark-ignition (SI) conditions is required, winch
   results in significant fuel efficiency penalties. In case of a mild HEV
   the torque assist from the electric motor is able to extend the
   residence time in HCCI, thereby reducing the number OSC depletion
   events. The applied supervisory controller, which decides when to switch
   between SI and HCCI, is based on the equivalent consumption minimization
   strategy (ECMS) and incorporates the fuel penalties associated with mode
   switching and OSC depletion. It is shown that, while the impact of the
   OSC depletion on drive cycle fuel economy of the mild HEV is still
   significant, it is much smaller than in case of the vehicle without
   electric motor. The prolonged operation in lean HCCI mode leads to
   substantial amounts of tailpipe NOx for all drive cycles tested. In a
   case study two modifications to the system hardware are introduced with
   counterintuitive results. First, the HCCI regime is further constrained
   to conditions where engine-out NOx levels are extremely low. Second, the
   size of the OSC is significantly reduced, allowing a much faster and
   less inefficient depletion. Associated drive cycle results show a
   substantial reduction in tailpipe NOx while fuel economy benefits can be
   maintained. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{3708-3717}},
Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are the key
   subpopulation for tumor relapse and metastasis. Due to cancer plasticity
   in surface antigen and enzymatic activity markers, functional
   tumorsphere assays are promising alternatives for CSC identification. To
   reliably quantify rare CSCs (1-5\%), thousands of single-cell suspension
   cultures are required. While microfluidics is a powerful tool in
   handling single cells, previous works provide limited throughput and
   lack automatic data analysis capability required for high-throughput
   studies. In this study, we present the scaling and automation of
   high-throughput single-cell-derived tumor sphere assay chips,
   facilitating the tracking of up to similar to 10000 cells on a chip with
   similar to 76.5\% capture rate. The presented cell capture scheme
   guarantees sampling a representative population from the bulk cells. To
   analyze thousands of single-cells with a variety of fluorescent
   intensities, a highly adaptable analysis program was developed for
   cell/sphere counting and size measurement. Using a Pluronic (R) F108
   (poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene
   glycol)) coating on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a suspension culture
   environment was created to test a controversial hypothesis: whether
   larger or smaller cells are more stem-like defined by the capability to
   form single-cellderived spheres. Different cell lines showed different
   correlations between sphere formation rate and initial cell size,
   suggesting heterogeneity in pathway regulation among breast cancer cell
   lines. More interestingly, by monitoring hundreds of spheres, we
   identified heterogeneity in sphere growth dynamics, indicating the
   cellular heterogeneity even within CSCs. These preliminary results
   highlight the power of unprecedented high-throughput and automation in
   CSC studies.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{7613-7623}},
Abstract = {{The phase separation behavior of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) in ionic
   liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ({[}EMIM]{[}BF4])
   was investigated by rheological, optical microscopy, FT-IR and DSC
   measurements. It is demonstrated that specific interactions,
   particularly the hydrogen bonding between PEO and the ionic liquids as
   evidenced by FT-IR, in which a subtle but apparent absorption peak shift
   near the phase transition appears, account for the unusual low critical
   solution temperature (LCST) phase separation. Unlike the typical trend
   in which the storage modulus G' simply increases with temperature near
   the phase boundary for polymer blends without specific interaction, in
   our study, a novel ``V-shaped'' rheological response is observed, namely
   a dip in G' followed by an upturn, especially at low PEO concentration
   (<50 wt\%). The magnitude of the ``V'' dip has heating rate and
   frequency dependences, while T-r (the phase transition temperature) is
   almost unchanged with heating rate and frequency. Upon increasing the
   alkyl chain length on the imidazolium ring from an ethyl to a butyl, the
   ``V-shape'' becomes more prominent and shifts to higher temperature,
   which is consistent with the results of FT-IR and DSC, evidently due to
   the stronger hydrogen bonding interaction between PEO and
   {[}BMIM]{[}BF4] than {[}EMIM]{[}BF4]. This unusual ``V'' dip might be
   tentatively ascribed to the coupling effects of the breaking of the
   ``hydrogen bonding cage'' formed between PEO chains and IL molecules and
   dissolution of the heterogeneous clusters as verified by FT-IR and TEM,
   respectively, and the following upturn is dominated by the interface
   formation upon phase separation.}},

Abstract = {{Transcription makes speech accessible to deaf and hard of hearing
   people. This conversion of speech to text is still done manually by
   humans, despite high cost, because the quality of automated speech
   recognition (ASR) is still too low in real-world settings. Manual
   conversion can require more than 5 times the original audio time, which
   also introduces significant latency. Giving transcriptionists ASR output
   as a starting point seems like a reasonable approach to making humans
   more efficient and thereby reducing this cost, but the effectiveness of
   this approach is clearly related to the quality of the speech
   recognition output. At high error rates, fixing inaccurate speech
   recognition output may take longer than producing the transcription from
   scratch, and transcriptionists may not realize when transcription output
   is too inaccurate to be useful. In this paper, we empirically explore
   how the latency of transcriptions created by participants recruited on
   Amazon Mechanical Turk vary based on the accuracy of speech recognition

Abstract = {{Current diagnosis of coronary artery disease relies on visual
   examination of angiograms by operators to identify significant stenoses
   in arteries. The significant limitations of this approach are both under
   and over-calling of stenoses. Although techniques such as quantitative
   coronary angiography (QCA) are available, these still require human
   input and resource costs. Thus, an automated system is required to
   quantitatively analyze angiograms. Although there are some methods for
   segmenting the vessels, these methods are mostly based on artifacts-free
   assumption. In this paper we propose a fully-automated system for
   analyzing X-ray coronary angiograms in which an angiogram video is
   analyzed first to select the frames containing maximum visible
   vasculature. Then, an accurate vascular network skeleton is generated
   and a profile of vessel thickness along the skeleton is estimated.
   Moreover, the proposed method calculates the tortuosity to remove the
   catheter from the images. The accuracy of the proposed method is
   assessed with ground truth generated manually by cardiologists.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports on frequency tunable AlGaN/GaN acoustic resonators
   that utilize piezoelectric actuation based on depletion-mediated strain
   in the AlGaN layer and piezo-resistive readout utilizing the
   two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) induced at the AlGaN/GaN interface.
   The effects of the DC current flowing through (I) forward biased
   Schottky inter-digitated electrodes in Class I resonators, and (II)
   drain/source Ohmic contacts of an integrated AlGaN/GaN HEMT in Class II
   resonators are studied. The readout electrodes in Class I resonators are
   Ni/Au Schottky contacts, whereas in Class II resonators, Ti/Al/Ti/Au
   metal stack is deposited and annealed to form Ohmic contacts. In both
   classes of devices, wide-range frequency tuning is achieved by flowing
   DC current through the contacts, causing large elastic modulus change
   due to Joule heating of the device. Frequency tuning allows for
   compensation of effects of fabrication variations as well as
   environmental changes. The 9th-order width-extensional resonance mode at
   730 MHz of Class I resonators is tuned by more than 500 ppm at 25 mW of
   input DC power, while maintaining a quality factor (Q) of similar to
   4,500 with no performance degradation over the tuning range. The same
   mode of Class II resonators at 719 MHz shows Q amplification from 1,710
   at V-Ds = 4 V to 13,851 at V-Ds = 9 V. with more than 2,500 ppm of
   frequency tuning. Resonant devices with such large frequency tuning arc
   perfect candidates as in-situ temperature sensors, where the resonance
   frequency shift is an indicator of the temperature rise in the channel
   of the suspended HEMT.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new electro-optical shutter with measured
   transmission loss of less than 1 3 dB in the shutter ON state and
   isolation of similar to 14 dB in the shutter OFF state. The shutter is
   composed of sub-wavelength metallic slits filled with germanium
   telluride (GeTe) phase change material (PCM). The slits serve both as
   waveguides for extra-ordinary transmission of optical signal and as nano
   heaters for changing the phase of GeTe. This work focuses on thermal and
   optical characterization of the GeTe slits in both amorphous and
   crystalline states through Joule heating. As GeTe goes through its phase
   transition, its complex reflective index changes, resulting in a
   significant shift in the optical property of the shutter. In this work,
   the shutter is designed to have a strong peak in the transmission (with
   >75\% transmission amplitude) at 11550 nm in the amorphous (OFF) state
   of GeTe. When GeTe crystalizes, the wavelength of transmission peak
   shifts and the transmission amplitude is modulated, resulting in only
   4\% transmission at 11550 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this work is
   the first demonstration of optical modulators using PCM and providing
   such a high contrast.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable evidence showing that ECM is an important regulator of
   cellular behavior including adhesion, metastasis, proliferation, and
   differentiation. Although hydrogel has been used in the cell culture,
   previous works focus on the collective cell behaviors rather than single
   cell heterogeneity. This paper reports a novel gel-islands microfluidic
   platform enabling single cells tracking in biomimetic three-dimensional
   (3D) microenvironment, The platform has the advantages of (1) reliable
   single cell encapsulation in 3D gel-islands. (2) high-throughput
   single-cell drug screening assays, and (3) automatic single cell lineage
   tracking. Combining gel-based 3D culture and single cell resolution, the
   presented platform can monitor cellular behaviors of hundreds of
   individual cells in 3D ECM microenviromnent using small amount of matrix
   reagents and drugs.}},

   research frontiers, including sensitive biochemical analysis and novel
   photonic devices, such as on-chip coherent light sources and bio-tunable
   lasers. Here we investigated an optofluidic FRET laser using quantum
   dots (QDs) as FRET donors. We achieved lasing from Cy5 as the acceptor
   in the QD-Cy5 pair with excitation at 450 nm where Cy5 has negligible
   absorption by itself. The threshold was approximately 14 mu J/mm(2). The
   demonstrated capability of QDs as the donor in a FRET laser greatly
   improves the versatility of optofluidic laser operation due to the broad
   and large absorption cross section of QDs in the blue and UV spectral
   region. The excitation efficiency of the acceptor molecules through FRET
   channel was also analyzed, showing that the energy transfer rate and the
   non-radiative Auger recombination rate of QDs plays a significant role
   in FRET laser performance.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the stability of a monovacancy in alpha zirconium under
   various strains and pressures by examining the vacancy formation energy
   through first-principles calculations. There is a maximum formation
   energy of 2.35 eV under uniaxial strain corresponding to a c/a ratio of
   1.75. Under volumetric strain, the formation energy increases as the
   strain increases. The formation energy as a function of the volumetric
   stress or pressure was also examined, with a minimum value of 2.00 eV at
   zero pressure. Using the equations of state method, we find that the
   formation volume of the vacancies decreases as the pressure increases,
   with a value of 0.6 unit-atom-volume at zero pressure. The formation
   enthalpy increases monotonically as the pressure increases. We predict
   that the avalanche pressure of alpha zirconium is -15 GPa, where vacancy
   formation is exothermic, causing avalanche swelling and the failure of
   the material.}},

Abstract = {{The notion of maximal permissiveness plays an important role in
   synthesis problems in the supervisory control framework. It is well
   known that the supervisor synthesis problem has a unique supremal
   solution when all the events are observable. However, under the partial
   observation setting, no supremal solution exists in general and there
   may exist several locally maximal solutions. In this paper, we tackle
   the supervisory control problem under partial observation from a new
   angle. First, we propose an approach to verify whether a given
   supervisor is maximal or not. If a supervisor is not maximal, then we
   provide an algorithm that synthesizes a new supervisor that is strictly
   more permissive than the given one. To the best of our knowledge, both
   the verification of maximality and the synthesis of a larger solution
   were previously open problems; our algorithms are the first ones of
   their kind.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on a reconfigurable bandpass filter for X-band
   applications. The filter is composed of coupled lambda/2 microstrip line
   resonators. Center frequency tuning of each resonator is achieved using
   an RF switch based on a phase change chalcogenide compound, germanium
   telluride, which switches in and out a loading capacitor. A combination
   of electric and magnetic coupling between the resonators realizes a near
   constant absolute-bandwidth as the filter is tuned. The center frequency
   of the filter is switched between 7.45 and 8.07 GHz, with a 3-dB
   bandwidth of similar to 500 MHz, insertion loss of less than 3.2 dB, and
   return loss of better than 18 dB. The measured third-order inter
   modulation intercept point (IIP3) and 1-dB power compression point
   (P-1dB) are better than 30 dBm at frequency offset of 1 kHz and 25 dBm,
   respectively. Measured and simulated results are in good agreement. To
   our best knowledge, this is the first time implementation of a tunable
   filter using germanium telluride based phase change switches.}},

   very desirable because it is generally very challenging to realize

   generic strategy for fabricating high-performance flexible Si

   nanoimprint lithography patterned deep-submicron-scale channel lengths
   which can be easily adapted for large-area and high throughput
   roll-to-roll manufacturing processes. A unique etched-channel
   configuration was used to allow for device fabrication compatible with
   flexible substrates. Optimal device parameters were obtained through
   device simulation to understand the underlying device physics and to
   enhance device controllability. Theoretically, the maximum frequency
   (f(max)) of flexible Si NM TFTs can exceed 100 GHz. Experimentally,
   record breaking 5 GHz and 38 GHz f(T) and f(max) values, respectively,

Abstract = {{Managing uncertainty caused by the large-scale integration of wind power
   is a challenge in both the day-ahead planning and real-time operation of
   a power system. Increasing system flexibility is the key factor in
   preserving operational reliability. While distributed energy storage is
   a promising way to increase system flexibility, its benefits have to be
   optimally exploited to justify its high installation cost.
   Optimally operating distributed energy storage in an uncertain
   environment requires decisions on multiple time scales. Additionally,
   storage operation needs to be coordinated with the scheduling and
   dispatching of conventional generators. This paper proposes and
   demonstrates a three-level framework for coordinating day-ahead, near
   real-time and minute-by-minute control actions of conventional
   generating units and distributed energy storage. A case study
   illustrates the interactions between the three levels and the
   effectiveness of this approach both in terms of economics and
   operational reliability.}},

   Cone (SOC) relaxations, have attracted significant interest in recent
   years. Thus far, little attention has been given to simpler linear
   relaxations of the power flow equations, which may bring significant
   performance gains at the cost of bounding strength. To fill the gap,
   this paper develops two intuitive linear relaxations of the power flow
   equations, one based on classic network flow models (NF) and another
   inspired by copper plate approximations (CP). Theoretical results show
   that the proposed NF model is a relaxation of the established nonlinear
   SOC model and the CP model is a relaxation of the NF model. An
   experimental study on 94 real-world test cases demonstrates that the
   linear relaxations are very fast and only reduce the bounding strength
   by a few percent. Consequently, considering the linear NF and CP
   relaxations alongside established relaxations (SDP, QC, SOC) provides a
   rich variety of tradeoffs between relaxation strength and performance.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing environmental awareness, strategies that include energy
   storage and emissions constraints or costs in the dispatch algorithm
   have been proposed. However, the problem is challenging because the
   real-time ancillary service dispatch signal is stochastic. The objective
   of this paper is to develop an optimal power flow formulation with
   energy storage that ensures emissions objectives are met. To achieve
   this, we propose a stochastic formulation which includes (i)
   uncertainties in reserve actions; (ii) re-dispatch reserves to manage
   state of charge of energy storage; (iii) an emissions constraint. We
   investigate methods to solve this problem via chance constraints. We
   also use this new formulation to study costs/emissions trade-offs
   associated with energy storage integration. We find that energy storage
   may not always be the economically and environmentally preferable option
   for providing reserves; factors that affect the dispatch results include
   demand level, supply-demand mismatch characteristics, energy storage
   round trip efficiency, and cost of re-dispatch reserves.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing need for integrating renewable generation sources
   into electricity networks. To take advantage of the economic and
   environmental benefits offered by renewable sources, storage devices are
   important to mitigate their inherent variability. However, the physical
   properties of storage devices require operation to be optimized over a
   finite horizon. This paper provides a multi-period optimal power flow
   (OPF) formulation including both wind generation and energy storage that
   is based on a traditional AC-Quadratic Program (AC-QP) OPF solution
   method. Test cases are provided to demonstrate the economic benefits of
   the multi-period OPF solution. The sensitivity of the cost of operation
   and scheduled storage charging pattern to the length of the multi-period
   OPF horizon chosen is assessed. Additionally, the computation time for
   various OPF horizons is also examined. Finally, the effect of forecast
   errors on the choice of OPF horizon is investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Batteries can be used to provide ancillary services to electric power
   systems; however, a battery's energy storage capacity degrades as it
   consumes and produces power. To improve the economics of batteries, we
   wish to control them in ways that minimize degradation. This is a
   challenging task because i) battery dynamics are nonlinear, ii) battery
   power dynamics are on a completely different timescale than battery
   degradation dynamics, and iii) batteries only have one control input
   (current) and if we wish to achieve two objectives (signal tracking
   accuracy and degradation minimization) we must trade-off between them.
   We extend an existing nonlinear battery model, pose the battery
   control/management problem as a tracking control problem, and develop
   three controllers based upon PID control, feedback linearization, and
   sliding mode control. In simulation, we show how the controllers enable
   us to easily tradeoff tracking accuracy and battery life, and how
   explicitly considering nonlinear battery dynamics in the controllers
   improves performance. We also show how state estimation error and model
   mismatch impact the performance of the feedback linearization
   controller, and how the sliding model control is more more robust to
   these errors.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increase of intermittent renewable energy sources, it is
   becoming more important to consider renewable generation forecast error
   when solving the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. The stochastic OPF,
   which uses multiple forecast scenarios, generally leads to a lower cost
   compared to the standard deterministic OPF, which uses a single
   forecast. However, the stochastic OPF is computationally more demanding
   than the deterministic OPF. Both cost savings and computation times
   further increase when storage units or ramp-constrained generators are
   included, as they require solving a multi-period OPF problem. Our
   contribution is a hybrid method approaching the cost performance of the
   stochastic OPF while maintaining a computational burden close to the
   deterministic OPF. The method combines elements from both the stochastic
   and the deterministic OPF, and relies on Benders Cuts to interface them.
   Using a receding horizon approach over one year, we find that, based on
   eleven test cases, one version of our hybrid method leads to at least
   70\% of the cost improvement of the stochastic OPF, while the
   computation time increase is at most 40\% of the stochastic OPF time
   increase. Furthermore, the computational advantage of our method
   increases with the system size. Two different versions of the method
   allow favoring of either the computational improvement or the cost
   improvement. We also identify directions for further improvement.
   Finally, our method can be used for more general problems in which one
   wishes to combine two models with different levels of complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are intended to provide independent

   However, development and testing of BCIs is typically conducted with
   copy-spelling of provided text, which models only a small portion of a
   functional communication task. This study was designed to determine how
   BCI performance is affected by novel text generation. We used a
   within-subject single-session study design in which subjects used a BCI
   to perform copy-spelling of provided text and to generate self-composed
   text to describe a picture. Additional off-line analysis was performed
   to identify changes in the event-related potentials that the BCI detects
   and to examine the effects of training the BCI classifier on
   task-specific data. Accuracy was reduced during the picture description
   task; (t(8) = 2.59 p =.0321). Creating the classifier using
   self-generated text data significantly improved accuracy on these data;
   (t(7) = -2.68, p =.0317), but did not bring performance up to the level
   achieved during copy-spelling. Thus, this study shows that the task for
   which the BCI is used makes a difference in BCI accuracy. Task-specific
   BCI classifiers are a first step to counteract this effect, but
   additional study is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Fluidic circuits made up of tiny chambers, conduits, and membranes can
   be fabricated in soft substrates to realize pressure-based sequential
   logic functions. Additional chambers in the same substrate covered with
   thin membranes can function as bubble-like tactile features. Sequential
   addressing of bubbles with fluidic logic enables just two external
   electronic valves to control of any number of tactile features by
   ``clocking in{''} pressure states one at a time. But every additional
   actuator added to a shift register requires an additional clock pulse to
   address, so that the display refresh rate scales inversely with the
   number of actuators in an array. In this paper, we build a model of a
   fluidic logic circuit that can be used for sequential addressing of
   bubble actuators. The model takes the form of a hybrid automaton
   combining the discrete dynamics of valve switching and the continuous
   dynamics of compressible fluid flow through fluidic resistors (conduits)
   and capacitors (chambers). When parameters are set according to the
   results of system identification experiments on a physical prototype,
   pressure trajectories and propagation delays predicted by simulation of
   the hybrid automaton compare favorably to experiment. The propagation
   delay in turn determines the maximum clock rate and associated refresh
   rate for a refreshable braille display intended for rendering a full
   page of braille text or tactile graphics.}},

   achieved. Processing dense, thin films matching bulk counterpart
   properties remains a very difficult target arising from energy and/or
   equipment intensive sintering, Li volatilization, and contamination from
   substrates. We show that using metalloorganic derived flame made
   nanoparticles can overcome these processing challenges resulting in a
   significantly reduced energy input required for densification, 10-40
   fold shorter dwell times at sintering temperatures, compared to common
   solid state reaction derived c-LLZO. Furthermore, surface/volume ratios
   of the films are determined to be a critical factor affecting final
   microstructures and phase compositions of the sintered films. Through
   careful control of the processing variables, 10-15 grains thick, dense
   (94 +/- 1\%) c-LLZO thin (< 30 mm), flexible films with high ambient
   ionic conductivities (0.2 +/- 0.03 mS cm(-1)) are achieved using
   conventional casting-sintering of flame made nanoparticles. These c-LLZO
   membranes greatly increase the selection of complementary cell
   components and simplify battery configurations broadening opportunities
   for cell designs.}},

   on an Optimal Grey Verhulst Model}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{In order to reduce the harm of red tide to marine ecological balance,
   marine fisheries, aquatic resources, and human health, an optimal Grey
   Verhulst model is proposed to predict the concentration of nitrogen in
   seawater, which is the key factor in red tide. The Grey Verhulst model
   is established according to the existing concentration data series of
   nitrogen in seawater, which is then optimized based on background value
   and time response formula to predict the future changes in the nitrogen
   concentration in seawater. Finally, the accuracy of the model is tested
   by the posterior test. The results show that the prediction value based
   on the optimal Grey Verhulst model is in good agreement with the
   measured nitrogen concentration in seawater, which proves the
   effectiveness of the optimal Grey Verhulst model in the forecast of red
   tide.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, we conduct large-scale orbital-free density
   functional theory calculations to study the energetics of vacancy
   clustering in aluminium from electronic structure calculations by
   accurately accounting for both the electronic structure and long-ranged
   elastic fields. Our results show positive binding energies for a range
   of vacancy clusters considered. However, the binding energies for the
   various quad-vacancy clusters considered in this study are vastly
   different, and only some of these clusters are found to be stable with
   respect to dissociation into divacancies. This suggests that, while
   vacancy clustering is an energetically feasible mechanism, this happens
   preferentially through the formation of certain vacancy clusters. Among
   the vacancy clusters considered in this study, the 19 vacancy hexagonal
   cluster lying in \{11\} plane has a very large binding energy with the
   relaxed atomic structure representative of a prismatic dislocation loop.
   This suggests that vacancy prismatic loops as small as those formed from
   19 vacancies are stable, thus providing insights into the nucleation
   sizes of these defects in aluminium.}},

Abstract = {{Networks-on-chip (NoCs) are increasingly being adopted as the
   interconnect model for systems-on-chip and chip-multiprocessors. As the
   only communication medium in these designs, the NoC's functional
   correctness is critical. In practice, design-time verification of NoCs
   is always partial, due to their large scale and the challenges that
   hinder verification efforts. As a result, functional design bugs are
   bound to escape and potentially manifest at runtime, compromising system
   functionality.
   We propose REPAIR, a runtime solution to detect and recover from
   functional design errors that have escaped in NoCs. Existing runtime
   verification techniques incur significant area and performance overheads
   to monitor and check the correctness of every packet traversing the
   network. However, REPAIR relies on a retransmission-based technique that
   adaptively determines the subset of packets requiring protection by
   identifying dynamic network regions where the specific runtime execution
   is likely to expose functional design bugs. We achieve runtime
   correctness at lower performance and area costs, relative to a
   traditional solution: on average, we are able to achieve more than 50\%
   better overall performance with 2-3x fewer retransmission buffers.}},

Abstract = {{A key challenge of entity set expansion is that multifaceted input seeds
   can lead to significant incoherence in the result set. In this paper, we
   present a novel solution to handling multifaceted seeds by combining
   existing user-generated ontologies with a novel word similarity metric
   based on skip-grams. By blending the two resources we are able to
   produce sparse word ego-networks that are centered on the seed terms and
   are able to capture semantic equivalence among words. We demonstrate
   that the resulting networks possess internally-coherent clusters, which
   can be exploited to provide non-overlapping expansions, in order to
   reflect different semantic classes of the seeds. Empirical evaluation
   against state-of-the-art baselines shows that our solution, EgoSet, is
   able to not only capture multiple facets in the input query, but also
   generate expansions for each facet with higher precision.}},

Abstract = {{Phased-array antenna (PAA) technology plays a significant role in modern
   day radar and communication networks. True-time-delay (TTD) enabled beam
   steering networks provide several advantages over their electronic
   counterparts, including squint-free beam steering, low RF loss, immunity
   to electromagnetic interference (EMI), and large bandwidth control of
   PAAs. Chip-scale and integrated TTD modules promise a miniaturized,
   light-weight system; however, the modules are still rigid and they
   require complex packaging solutions. Moreover, the total achievable time
   delay is still restricted by the wafer size. In this work, we propose a
   light-weight and large-area, true-time-delay beamforming network that
   can be fabricated on light-weight and flexible/rigid surfaces utilizing
   low-cost ``printing{''} techniques. In order to prove the feasibility of
   the approach, a 2-bit thermo-optic polymer TTD network is developed
   using a combination of imprinting and ink-jet printing. RF beam steering
   of a 1x4 X-band PAA up to 60 degrees is demonstrated. The development of
   such active components on large area, light-weight, and low-cost
   substrates promises significant improvement in size, weight, and power
   (SWaP) requirements over the state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the damping properties of digital materials from the
   Objet Connex 3D Printer from Stratsys. The Objet Connex printer is a
   unique 3D printer because in a single print job, ten different materials
   with different stiffness can be utilized. The printer utilizes two base
   materials and mixes them in different ratios to obtain varying stiffness
   levels. The first base material, VeroWhitePlus (TM) is a rigid opaque
   plastic and the second base material, TangoPlus (TM) is a rubbery
   translucent material. This 3D printer has a variety of applications
   including the development of metastructures for vibration suppression.
   It has been demonstrated that both the VeroWhitePlus (TM) and TangoPlus
   (TM) materials exhibit viscoelastic behavior but extensive studies have
   not be carried out to determine the Young's Modulus and loss factor data
   in terms of frequency. This paper is the first step towards that goal.
   The paper begins by going into more detail about the properties of the
   printer and examines some previous work on determining the material
   properties. Next, the test method used it outlined and lastly the
   experimental set-up is described. In order to obtain data for a high
   range of frequencies, the material must be tested at various

   outer frame is used to maintain the integrity of the structure while the
   flexible chiral lattice and annular masses dissipate the energy. This
   combined assembly is characterized by high frequency bandgaps and tuned
   vibration attenuation at low frequencies. These inserts and masses have
   been previously optimized to find the optimal topology and tuning to
   reduce global vibration levels of the beam. Experimental results
   demonstrate the suppression capabilities of this structure for possible
   use in vibration absorption in load carrying structural members.}},

Abstract = {{The undesired destruction of healthy cells, either endogenous or
   transplanted, by the immune system results in the loss of tissue
   function or limits strategies to restore tissue function. Current
   therapies typically involve non-specific immunosuppression that may
   prevent the appropriate response to an antigen, thereby decreasing
   humoral immunity and increasing the risks of patient susceptibility to
   opportunistic infections, viral reactivation, and neoplasia. The
   induction of antigen-specific immunological tolerance to block undesired
   immune responses to self-or allogeneic antigens, while maintaining the
   integrity of the remaining immune system, has the potential to transform
   the current treatment of autoimmune disease and serve as a key enabling
   technology for therapies based on cell transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{As many countries embark on a major transitioning to the Smart Grid
   (SG), realizing the benefits of the new paradigm depends on generation,
   collection, and usage of unprecedented amount of data. With such
   proliferated data processing, there are legitimate concerns that call
   for sound privacy measures to ensure proper safekeeping. A significant
   portion of the potential benefits of the SG initiative, thus, relies on
   devising convincing mechanisms to strengthen the privacy. As a new
   distribution subsystem, microgrids are expected to play a crucial role
   in the SG. In this paper, we develop a privacy-aware microgrid power
   scheduling formulation with renewable sources and energy storage where
   five different classes of appliances are prioritized by smart meters.
   Our analysis shows that there is a tradeoff between maximizing the power
   usage and privacy levels. Hence, it is not possible to find a solution
   that maximizes both objectives simultaneously. However, it is possible
   to achieve significantly higher levels of privacy preservation with
   moderate sacrifice from the power usage, especially when the number of
   users is high.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce Harmonium, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization
   architecture that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors. Harmonium
   strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
   provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates. Harmonium uses only
   commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive, lightweight,
   and FCC compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or tag, fixed
   infrastructure anchors with known locations, and centralized processing
   that calculates the tag's position. Anchors employ a new frequency
   stepped narrowband receiver architecture that rejects narrow band
   interferers and extracts high-resolution timing information without the
   cost or complexity of traditional ultra-wideband approaches. In a
   complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
   Harmonium exhibit less than 31 cm of error with an average 9 cm of
   inter-sample noise. In non-line-of sight conditions (i.e. through-wall),
   90\% of position error is less than 42 cm. The tag draws 75 mW when
   actively transmitting, or 3.9 mi per location fix at the 19 Hz update
   rate. Tags weigh 3 g and cost \$4.50 USI) at modest volumes. Harmonium
   introduces a new design point for indoor localization and enables
   localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors, devices
   previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture systems.}},

Abstract = {{Rapidly processing high-velocity text data is critical for many
   technical and business applications. Widely used software solutions for
   processing these large text corpora target disk-resident data and rely
   on pre-computed indexes and large clusters to achieve high performance.
   However, greater capacity and falling costs are enabling a shift to
   RAM-resident data sets. The enormous bandwidth of RAM can facilitate
   scan operations that are competitive with pre-computed indexes for
   interactive, ad-hoc queries. However, software approaches for processing
   these large text corpora fall far short of saturating available
   bandwidth and meeting peak scan rates possible on modern memory systems.
   In this paper, we present HAWK, a hardware accelerator for ad hoc
   queries against large in-memory logs. HAWK comprises a stall-free
   hardware pipeline that scans input data at a constant rate, examining
   multiple input characters in parallel during a single accelerator clock
   cycle. We describe a IGHz 32-characterwide HAWK design targeting ASIC
   implementation, designed to process data at 32GB/s (up to two orders of
   magnitude faster than software solutions), and demonstrate a scaled-down
   FPGA prototype that operates at lOOMHz with 4-wide parallelism, which
   processes at 400MB/s (13x faster than software grep for large
   multi-pattern scans).}},

Abstract = {{Multiple aspects of the local extracellular environment profoundly
   affect cell phenotype and function. Physical and chemical cues in the
   environment trigger intracellular signaling cascades that ultimately
   activate transcription factors (TFs) -powerful regulators of the cell
   phenotype. TRACER (TRanscriptional Activity CEll aRrays) was employed
   for large-scale, dynamic quantification of TF activity in human
   fibroblasts cultured on hydrogels with a controlled elastic modulus and
   integrin ligand density. We identified three groups of TFs: responders
   to alterations in ligand density alone, substrate stiffness or both.
   Dynamic networks of regulatory TFs were constructed computationally and
   revealed distinct TF activity levels, directionality (i.e., activation
   or inhibition), and dynamics for adhesive and mechanical cues. Moreover,
   TRACER networks predicted conserved hubs of TF activity across multiple
   cell types, which are significantly altered in clinical fibrotic
   tissues. Our approach captures the distinct and overlapping effects of
   adhesive and mechanical stimuli, identifying conserved signaling
   mechanisms in normal and disease states.}},

   compared to bulk phases. Increased reactivity, deviations in structural,
   thermodynamic and kinetic properties make nanoscale materials and
   processes attractive for both fundamental research and applications.
   Here we show that nanometer thin films of materials with dielectric
   properties at the macroscopic level such as SiO2, Ta2O5 and HfO2 behave
   as solid electrolytes and exhibit evident ionic transport and
   electrochemical redox reactions. Experimental studies demonstrate that
   classical electrochemical potentiodynamic and steady state methods can
   be used to study the mass and charge transport at the nanoscale. We
   believe these reported properties of nanomatter open new opportunities
   for fundamental research and applications.}},

Abstract = {{New advances in nanotechnology and material processing is creating
   opportunities for the design and fabrication of a new generation of thin
   film sensors that can used to assess structural health. In particular,
   thin film sensors attached to large areas of the structure surface has
   the potential to provide spatially rich data on the performance and
   health of a structure. This study focuses on the development of a fully
   integrated strain sensor that is fabricated on a flexible substrate for
   potentially use in sensing skins. This is completed using a carbon
   nanotube-polymer composite material that is patterned on a flexible
   polyimide substrate using optical lithography. The piezoresistive carbon
   nanotube elements are integrated into a complete sensing system by
   patterning copper electrodes and integrating off-the-shelf electrical
   components on the flexible film for expanded functionality. This diverse
   material utilization is realized in a versatile process flow to
   illustrate a powerful toolbox for sensing severity, location, and
   failure mode of damage on structural components. The fully integrated
   patterned carbon nanotube strain sensor is tested on a quarter-scale,
   composite beam column connection. The results and implications for
   future structural damage detection are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an information repository to support bridge
   monitoring applications on a cloud computing platform. Bridge
   monitoring, with instrumentation of sensors in particular, collects
   significant amount of data. In addition to sensor data, a wide variety
   of information such as bridge geometry, analysis model and sensor
   description need to be stored. Data management plays an important role
   to facilitate data utilization and data sharing. While bridge
   information modeling (BrIM) technologies and standards have been
   proposed and they provide a means to enable integration and facilitate
   interoperability, current BrIM standards support mostly the information
   about bridge geometry. In this study, we extend the BrIM schema to
   include analysis models and sensor information. Specifically, using the
   OpenBrIM standards as the base, we draw on CSI Bridge, a commercial
   software widely used for bridge analysis and design, and SensorML, a
   standard schema for sensor definition, to define the data entities
   necessary for bridge monitoring applications. NoSQL database systems are
   employed for data repository. Cloud service infrastructure is deployed
   to enhance scalability, flexibility and accessibility of the data
   management system. The data model and systems are tested using the
   bridge model and the sensor data collected at the Telegraph Road Bridge,
   Monroe, Michigan.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as a powerful mobile sensing
   platform for assessing the health of civil infrastructure systems. To
   date, the majority of their uses have been dedicated to vision and
   laser-based spatial imaging using on-board cameras and LiDAR units,
   respectively. Comparatively less work has focused on integration of
   other sensing modalities relevant to structural monitoring applications.
   The overarching goal of this study is to explore the ability for UAVs to
   deploy a network of wireless sensors on structures for controlled
   vibration testing. The study develops a UAV platform with an integrated
   robotic gripper that can be used to install wireless sensors in
   structures, drop a heavy weight for the introduction of impact loads,
   and to uninstall wireless sensors for reinstallation elsewhere. A pose
   estimation algorithm is embedded in the UAV to estimate the location of
   the UAV during sensor placement and impact load introduction. The
   Martlet wireless sensor network architecture is integrated with the UAV
   to provide the UAV a mobile sensing capability. The UAV is programmed to
   command field deployed Martlets, aggregate and temporarily store data
   from the wireless sensor network, and to communicate data to a fixed
   base station on site. This study demonstrates the integrated UAV system
   using a simply supported beam in the lab with Martlet wireless sensors
   placed by the UAV and impact load testing performed. The study verifies
   the feasibility of the integrated UAV-wireless monitoring system
   architecture with accurate modal characteristics of the beam estimated
   by modal analysis.}},

Title = {{A hybrid Brownian dynamics/constitutive model for yielding, aging, and
   rejuvenation in deforming polymeric glasses}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{6757-6770}},
Abstract = {{We present a hybrid model for polymeric glasses under deformation that
   combines a minimal model of segmental dynamics with a beads-and-springs
   model of a polymer, solved by Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations, whose
   relaxation is coupled to the segmental dynamics through the drag
   coefficient of the beads. This coarse-grained model allows simulations
   that are much faster than molecular dynamics and successfully capture
   the entire range of mechanical response including yielding, plastic
   flow, strain-hardening, and incomplete strain recovery. The
   beads-and-springs model improves upon the dumbbell model for glassy
   polymers proposed by Fielding et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., 2012, 108,
   048301) by capturing the small elastic recoil seen experimentally
   without the use of ad hoc adjustments of parameters required in the
   model of Fielding et al. With appropriate choice of parameters,
   predictions of creep, recovery, and segmental relaxation are found to be
   in good agreement with poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) data of Lee et
   al. (Science, 2009, 323, 231-234). Our model shows dramatic differences
   in behavior of the segmental relaxation time between extensional creep
   and steady extension, and between extension and shear. The non-monotonic
   response of the segmental relaxation time to extensional creep and the
   small elastic recovery after removal of stress are shown to arise from
   sub-chains that are trapped between folds, and that become highly
   oriented and stretched at strains of order unity, connecting the
   behavior of glassy polymers under creep to that of dilute polymer
   solutions under fast extensional flows. We are also able to predict the
   effects of polymer pre-orientation in the parallel or orthogonal
   direction on the subsequent response to extensional deformation.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of stabilizing the bilayer Saint-Venant model,
   which is a coupled system of two rightward and two leftward convecting
   transport partial differential equations (PDEs). In the stability
   proofs, we employ a Lyapunov function in which the parameters need to be
   successively determined. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is
   the first time this kind of Lyapunov function is employed, and this
   result is the first one on the stabilization of the linearized bilayer
   Saint-Venant model. Numerical simulations of the bilayer Saint-Venant

Abstract = {{A novel, efficient characterization technique for HF/VHF antennas from
   very-near-field measurements is presented. A measurement system with a
   non-intrusive broadband electro-optical (EO) probe is utilized to
   measure the tangential electric fields of an antenna under test (AUT) at
   a very-near surface enclosing the antenna. The non-metallic and
   small-size fiber-coupled EO probe does not perturb the current
   distribution over the antenna and is free from the complicated probe
   compensation. Far-field quantities of the AUT are derived from a newly
   developed near-field to far-field transformation method. In this way, a
   full spherical radiation pattern and gain of the AUT are attained
   without expensive computation and truncation errors. A miniaturized
   antenna operating low-VHF band (40 MHz) with dimensions 10 cm x 10 cm x
   15 cm (0.013 lambda(0)x0.013 lambda(0)x0.02 lambda(0)) is employed as
   the AUT. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through
   comparison with the results obtained from full-wave simulation and
   direct far field measurement performed in an outdoor range.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterial inspired structures, or metastructures, are structural
   members that incorporate periodic or non-periodic inserts. Recently, a
   new class of metastructures has been introduced which feature chiral
   lattice inserts. It was found that this type of inserts has frequency
   bandgaps which can be tuned by altering the geometry of the chiral
   lattice. Previous studies have shown that inserting non-periodic chiral
   lattices inside a beam-like structure results in efficient vibration
   attenuation at low frequencies. In the study presented in this paper, a
   genetic algorithm based optimization technique is developed to
   automatically generate chiral lattices which are tuned to suppress
   vibration in a flexible beam-like structure. Several parameters are
   incorporated in the optimization process such as the radius of circular
   nodes and characteristic angle as well as the spacing and distribution
   of circular inserts. The efficiency of the proposed optimization
   technique is verified analytically by numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable evidence suggests that cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are
   critical in tumor pathogenesis, but their rarity and transience has led
   to much controversy about their exact nature. Although CSCs can be
   functionally identified using dish-based tumorsphere assays, it is
   difficult to handle and monitor single cells in dish-based approaches;
   single cell-based microfluidic approaches offer better control and
   reliable single cell derived sphere formation. However, like normal stem
   cells, CSCs are heavily regulated by their microenvironment, requiring
   tumor-stromal interactions for tumorigenic and proliferative behaviors.
   To enable single cell derived tumorsphere formation within a stromal
   microenvironment, we present a dual adherent/suspension co-culture
   device, which combines a suspension environment for single-cell
   tumorsphere assays and an adherent environment for co-culturing stromal
   cells in close proximity by selectively patterning polyHEMA in indented
   microwells. By minimizing dead volume and improving cell capture
   efficiency, the presented platform allows for the use of small numbers
   of cells (<100 cells). As a proof of concept, we co-cultured single T47D
   (breast cancer) cells and primary cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF)
   on-chip for 14 days to monitor sphere formation and growth. Compared to
   mono-culture, co-cultured T47D have higher tumorigenic potential (sphere
   formation rate) and proliferation rates (larger sphere size).
   Furthermore, 96-multiplexed single-cell transcriptome analyses were
   performed to compare the gene expression of co-cultured and
   mono-cultured T47D cells. Phenotypic changes observed in co-culture
   correlated with expression changes in genes associated with
   proliferation, apoptotic suppression, tumorigenicity and even
   epithelial-to-mesechymal transition. Combining the presented platform
   with single cell transcriptome analysis, we successfully identified
   functional CSCs and investigated the phenotypic and transcriptome
   effects induced by tumor-stromal interactions.}},

Abstract = {{We achieved four types of laser emissions with quantum dots (QDs) using
   the same high-Q-factor optofluidic ring resonator (OFRR) platform. In
   the first type, 2 mu M QDs dissolved in toluene that filled the entire
   OFRR cavity volume were employed as the gain medium. The lasing
   threshold was 15-22 mu J/mm(2). In the second type, mu M aqueous QDs
   were in bulk buffer solution that filled the entire OFRR cavity volume.
   The lasing threshold was 0.1 mu J/mm(2), over 3 orders of magnitude
   lower than the state-of-the-art. In the third type, the aqueous QDs were
   immobilized as a single layer on the interface between the OFRR inner
   wall and buffer solution with a surface density as low as 3 x 10(9) -
   10(1)0cm(-2). The lasing threshold of 60 mu J/mm(2) was achieved. In the
   fourth type, we achieved optofluidic FRET lasing using aqueous QDs as
   FRET donors and Cy5 dye molecules as acceptors. We observed lasing from
   Cy5 emission band in QD-Cy5 pair when excited at QD absorption band, far
   away from Cy5 absorption maximum. We also report a comprehensive
   theoretical analysis of optofluidic FRET lasers that was performed based
   on a Fabry-Perot microcavity using a rate equation model. By comparing
   FRET lasing based sensors with conventional sensors using FRET signals
   obtained by spontaneous fluorescence emission, we show that for optimal
   pump fluence and FRET pair concentration, FRET lasing can lead to more
   than 20-fold enhancement in detection sensitivities of conformation
   changes for linker lengths in the Forster radius range.}},

Abstract = {{Origami has emerged as a potential tool for the design of mechanical
   metamaterials and metastructures whose novel properties originate from
   their crease patterns. Most of the attention in origami engineering has
   focused on the well-known Miura-Ori, a folded tessellation that is
   flat-foldable for folded sheet and stacked blocks. This study advances
   the state of the art and expands the research field to investigate
   generic degree-4 vertex ( 4-vertex) origami, with a focus on
   facet-binding. In order to understand how facet-binding attributes to
   the mechanical properties of 4-vertex origami structures, geometries of
   the 4-vertex origami cells are analyzed and analytically expressed.
   Through repeating and stacking 4-vertex cells, origami sheets and
   stacked origami blocks can be constructed. Geometry analyses discover
   two mechanisms that will lead to the self-locking of 4-vertex origami
   cells, sheets, and stacked blocks: in-cell facet-binding and inter-cell
   facet-binding. These two mechanisms and the predicted self-locking
   phenomena are verified through 3D simulations and prototype experiments.
   Finally, this paper briefly introduces the unusual mechanical properties
   caused by the locking of 4-vertex origami structures. The research
   reported in this paper could foster a new breed of self-locking
   structures with various engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a nanostructured piezoelectric beam is fabricated using
   vertically aligned lead zirconate titanate (PZT) nanowire arrays and its
   capability of continuous power generation is demonstrated through direct
   vibration tests. The lead zirconate titanate nanowires are grown on a
   PZT thin film coated titanium foil using a hydrothermal reaction. The
   PZT thin film serves as a nucleation site while the titanium foil is
   used as the bottom electrode. Electromechanical frequency response
   function (FRF) analysis is performed to evaluate the power harvesting
   efficiency of the fabricated device. Furthermore, the feasibility of the
   continuous power generation using the nanostructured beam is
   demonstrated through measuring output voltage from PZT nanowires when
   beam is subjected to a sinusoidal base excitation. The effect of tip
   mass on the voltage generation of the PZT nanowire arrays is evaluated
   experimentally. The final results show the great potential of
   synthesized piezoelectric nanowire arrays in a wide range of
   applications, specifically power generation at nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{Three-phase transduction affords certain advantages in the efficient
   electromechanical conversion of energy, especially at higher power
   scales. This paper considers the use of a three-phase electric machine
   for harvesting energy from vibrations. We consider the use of vector
   control techniques, which are common in the area of industrial
   electronics, for optimizing the feedback loops in a
   stochastically-excited energy harvesting system. To do this, we
   decompose the problem into two separate feedback loops for direct and
   quadrature current components, and illustrate how each might be
   separately optimized to maximize power output. In a simple analytical
   example, we illustrate how these techniques might be used to gain
   insight into the tradeoffs in the design of the electronic hardware and

Abstract = {{Recent investigations on the concept of modular metastructures have
   demonstrated remarkable adaptivity of properties as a synergistic
   product of assembling together metastable modules, modules that exhibit
   coexisting states for the same topology. It has been found that such
   modularity provides an accessible pathway for unprecedented massive
   property adaptation. Despite the extensive report on the static or
   quasistatic characteristics of modular metastructures, much remains to
   be explored regarding their dynamic characteristics. This research
   initiates the study on transient response of a modular metastructure
   under impulsive excitation. Numerical studies characterize the
   adaptability of energy exchange and localization characteristics
   afforded by metastable states. It is found that responses of internal
   bistable masses of the metastable modules play an important role in
   determining energy distribution of the overall system. It is discovered
   that low internal bistable mass and high impulsive energy level are
   beneficial for energy to be localized and dissipated internally.
   Additionally, mechanism behind effective energy absorption is disclosed.
   Overall, this investigation provides opportunities to tailor dynamical
   responses using modular metastructures and opens potential avenues for
   designing transient vibration absorbers.}},

Abstract = {{Wire rope (or cables) are a fundamental structural element in many
   engineering applications. Recently, there has been growing interest in
   stranding NiTi wires into cables to scale up the adaptive properties of
   NiTi tension elements and to make use of the desirable properties of
   wire rope. Exploratory experiments were performed to study the actuation
   behavior of two NiTi shape memory alloy cables and straight monofilament
   wire of the same material. The specimens were held under various dead
   loads ranging from 50 MPa to 400 MPa and thermally cycled 25 times from
   140 degrees C to 5 degrees C at a rate of 12 degrees C/min. Performance
   metrics of actuation stroke, residual strain, and work output were
   measured and compared between specimen types. The 7x7 cable exhibited
   similar actuation to the single straight wire, but with slightly longer
   stroke and marginally more shakedown, while maintaining equivalent
   specific work output. This leads to the conclusion that the 7x7 cable
   effectively scaled up the adaptive properties the straight wire. Under
   loads below 150 MPa, the 1 x 27 cable had up to double the actuation
   stroke and work output, but exhibited larger shakedown and poorer
   performance when loaded higher.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the reinforcement-matrix interface of fiber reinforced
   polymers has been modified through grafting nanostructures -
   particularly carbon nanotubes and ZnO nanowires - on to the fiber
   surface. This type of interface engineering has made a great impact on
   the development of multiscale composites that have high stiffness,
   interfacial strength, toughness, and vibrational damping - qualities
   that are mutually exclusive to a degree in most raw materials. Although
   the efficacy of such nanostructured interfaces has been established, the
   reinforcement mechanisms of these multiscale composites have not been
   explored. Here, strain transfer across a nanowire interphase is studied
   in order to gain a heightened understanding of the working principles of
   physical interface modification and the formation of a functional
   gradient. This problem is studied using a functionally graded
   piezoelectric interface composed of vertically aligned lead zirconate
   titanate nanowires, as their piezoelectric properties can be utilized to
   precisely control the strain on one side of the interface. The
   displacement and strain across the nanowire interface is captured using
   digital image correlation. It is demonstrated that the material gradient
   created through nanowires cause a smooth strain transfer from
   reinforcement phase into matrix phase that eliminates the stress
   concentration between these phases, which have highly mismatched
   elasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric nanowires, in particular zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires, have
   been vastly used in the fabrication of electromechanical devices to
   convert wasted mechanical energy into useful electrical energy. Over
   recent years, the growth of vertically aligned ZnO nanowires on various
   structural fibers has led to the development of fiber-based
   nanostructured energy harvesting devices. However, the development of
   more realistic energy harvesters that are capable of continuous power
   generation requires a sufficient mechanical strength to withstand
   typical structural loading conditions. Yet, a durable, multifunctional
   material system has not been developed thoroughly enough to generate
   electrical power without deteriorating the mechanical performance. Here,
   a hybrid composite energy harvester is fabricated in a hierarchical
   design that provides both efficient power generating capabilities while
   enhancing the structural properties of the fiber reinforced polymer
   composite. Through a simple and low-cost process, a modified aramid
   fabric with vertically aligned ZnO nanowires grown on the fiber surface
   is embedded between woven carbon fabrics, which serve as the structural
   reinforcement as well as the top and the bottom electrodes of the
   nanowire arrays. The performance of the developed multifunctional
   composite is characterized through direct vibration excitation and
   tensile strength examination.}},

Abstract = {{Designers faced with the task of developing the next model of a brand
   must balance several considerations. The design must be novel and
   express attributes important to the customers, while also recognizable
   as a representative of the brand. This balancing is left to the
   intuition of the designers, who must anticipate how all customers will
   perceive the new design. Oftentimes, the design freedom used to meet a
   styling attribute such as aggressiveness can compromise the recognition
   of the product as a member of the brand. In this paper, an experiment is
   conducted measuring change in ten styling attributes common to both
   design freedom and brand recognition for automotive designs, using
   customer responses to vehicle designs created interactively. Results
   show that, while brand recognition is highly dependent on the particular
   manufacturer, tradeoffs between design freedom and brand recognition may
   be measured using predictive models to inform strategic design
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated that the energetic vibrations of
   strategically designed negative stiffness inclusions may lead to large
   and adaptable damping in structural/material systems. Many researchers
   examine these features using models of bistable elements. From the
   viewpoint of system integration, bistable, negative stiffness elements
   often interface with positive stiffness elastic members. Under such
   conditions, the structural/material system may exhibit coexisting
   metastable states. In other words, the macroscopic displacement/strain
   remains fixed while the reaction force statically and/or dynamically
   varies due to internal change similar to a phase transition. This
   coexistence of metastable states is not manifested in an individual
   (stand-alone) bistable element. Although the static and low frequency
   dynamics of structural/material systems possessing coexisting metastable
   states have been explored, much remains to be understood regarding the
   dynamics and energy dissipation characteristics of such systems when
   excited near resonance, where nonlinear dynamics may be more easily
   activated and damping design is of great importance. Thus, to
   effectively elucidate the enhanced versatility of damping properties
   afforded by exploiting negative stiffness inclusions in
   structural/material systems, this research investigates a mechanical
   module which leverages a coexistence of metastable states: an archetypal
   building block for system assembly. The studies employ analytical,
   numerical, and experimental findings to probe how near-resonant
   excitation can trigger multiple dynamic states, each resulting in
   distinct energy dissipation features. It is shown that, for lightly
   damped metastable mechanical modules, the effective energy dissipation
   may be varied across orders of magnitude via tailoring design and
   excitation parameters. Potential applications and prototype systems are
   discussed to bridge the discoveries to future practice.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient biocatalytic cell-free system containing L-arabinitol
   dehydrogenase (LAD) for L-arabinitol oxidation and NADH oxidase (Nox)
   for cofactor regeneration was successfully constructed and used for
   L-rare sugar production. The recombinant LAD (HjLAD) from Hypocrea
   jecorina suffered from NADH inhibition. Applying Nox to the cell-free
   HjLAD system drove the thermodynamically unfavorable equilibrium from
   L-arabinitol to L-xylulose, along with the regeneration of the oxidized
   cofactor NAD+. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the
   conditions for L-xylulose production. The optimal conditions for
   biocatalytic production of L-xylulose were found to be 4.9 U mL(-1)
   HjLAD, 8.2 mM NAD+ at pH 8.0, and 30.9 degrees C; a high conversion rate
   of 78.4\% was achieved under these conditions. We demonstrate a
   cell-free enzyme coupling system enabling efficient cofactor recycling

Abstract = {{Objective The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists
   (ACGIH) proposed a method to assess the hand, wrist and forearm
   biomechanical overload based on exertions frequency (hand-activity
   level) and force use (normalized peak force). We applied the ACGIH
   threshold limit value (TLV)(R) method to a large occupational cohort to
   assess its ability to predict carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) onset.
   Methods A cohort of industrial and service workers was followed-up
   between 2000 and 2011. We investigated the incidence of CTS symptoms and
   CTS confirmed by nerve conduction studies (NCS). We then classified
   exposure with respect to action limit (AL) and TLV. Cox regression
   models including age, gender, body mass index, and presence of
   predisposing pathologies were conducted to estimate hazard ratios (HR)
   of CTS and population attributable fractions.
   Results We analyzed data from 3131 workers {[}females, N = 2032 (65\%);
   mean age at baseline 39.3, standard deviation (SD) 9.4 years]. We
   observed 431 incident cases of CTS symptoms in 8000 person-years and 126
   cases of CTS confirmed by NCS in 8883 person-years. The ACGIH TLV (R)
   method predicted both CTS symptoms {[}HR between AL and TLV 2.18, 95\%
   confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.86-2.56; above TLV 2.07, 95\% CI
   1.52-2.81] and CTS confirmed by NCS (HR between AL and TLV 1.93, 95\% CI
   1.38-2.71; above TLV 1.95, 95\% CI 1.27-3.00). About one third of CTS
   cases were attributable to exposure levels above the AL.
   Conclusions The ACGIH TLV (R) method predicted the risk of CTS, but the
   dose-response was flat above the AL; a fine-tuning of the proposed
   thresholds should be considered.}},

Volume = {{59}},

Pages = {{796-805}},
Abstract = {{Few statistical models of rear seat passenger posture have been
   published, and none has taken into account the effects of occupant age.
   This study developed new statistical models for predicting passenger
   postures in the rear seats of automobiles. Postures of 89 adults with a
   wide range of age and body size were measured in a laboratory mock-up in
   seven seat configurations. Posture-prediction models for female and male
   passengers were separately developed by stepwise regression using age,
   body dimensions, seat configurations and two-way interactions as
   potential predictors. Passenger posture was significantly associated
   with age and the effects of other two-way interaction variables depended
   on age. A set of posture-prediction models are presented for women and
   men, and the prediction results are compared with previously published
   models. This study is the first study of passenger posture to include a
   large cohort of older passengers and the first to report a significant
   effect of age for adults. The presented models can be used to position
   computational and physical human models for vehicle design and
   assessment.
   Practitioner Summary: The significant effects of age, body dimensions
   and seat configuration on rear seat passenger posture were identified.
   The models can be used to accurately position computational human models
   or crash test dummies for older passengers in known rear seat
   configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical modeling methods, such as the discrete element method (DEM),
   are an increasingly popular alternative to traditional semi-empirical
   terramechanics techniques. While DEM has many advantages, including the
   ability to model more complex running gear and terrain profiles, it has
   not reached widespread popularity due to its high computation costs. In
   this study a surrogate DEM model (S-DEM) was developed to maintain the
   simulation accuracy and capabilities of DEM with reduced computation
   costs. This marks one of the first surrogate models developed for DEM,
   and the first known model developed for terramechanics. By storing
   wheel-soil interaction forces and soil velocities extracted from
   constant velocity DEM simulations, S-DEM can quickly perform new dynamic
   wheel locomotion simulations. Using both DEM and S-DEM, wheel locomotion
   simulations were performed on flat and rough terrain. S-DEM was found to
   reproduce drawbar pull and driving torque well in both cases, though
   wheel sinkage errors were significant at times. Computation costs were
   reduced by three orders of magnitude in comparison to DEM, bringing the
   benefits of DEM modeling to vehicle design and control. The techniques
   used to develop S-DEM may be applicable to other common DEM
   applications, such as soil drilling, excavating, and plowing.}},

Abstract = {{P-and E-selectins are expressed on the surface of endothelial cells and
   may contribute to neutrophil recruitment following injurious lengthening
   contractions of skeletal muscle. Blunting neutrophil, but not
   macrophage, accumulation after lengthening contractions may provide a
   therapeutic benefit as neutrophils exacerbate damage to muscle fibers,
   while macrophages promote repair. In this study, we tested the
   hypothesis that P-and E-selectins contribute to neutrophil, but not
   macrophage, accumulation in muscles after contraction-induced injury,
   and that reducing neutrophil accumulation by blocking the selectins
   would be sufficient to reduce damage to muscle fibers. To test our
   hypothesis, we treated mice with antibodies to block P-and E-selectin
   function and assessed leukocyte accumulation and damage in muscles 2
   days after lengthening contractions. Treatment with P/E-selectin
   blocking antibodies reduced neutrophil content by about half in muscles
   subjected to lengthening contractions. In spite of the reduction in
   neutrophil accumulation, we did not detect a decrease in damage 2 days
   after lengthening contractions. We conclude that P- and/or E-selectin
   contribute to the neutrophil accumulation associated with
   contraction-induced muscle damage and that only a portion of the
   neutrophils that typically accumulate following injurious lengthening
   contractions is sufficient to induce muscle fiber damage and force
   deficits. Thus, therapeutic interventions based on blocking the
   selectins or other adhesion proteins will have to reduce neutrophil
   numbers by more than 50\% in order to provide a benefit.}},

   (MOOUC) for the selection of optimal cutting conditions in advanced
   abrasive machining processes. Processes considered are water-jet
   machining, abrasive water jet machining and ultra-sonic machining.
   Decisions regarding the cutting conditions can involve optimization for
   multiple competing goals; such as surface finish, machining time and
   power consumption. In practice, there is also an issue of variations in
   the ability to attain the performance goals. This can be due to
   limitations in machine accuracy or variations in material properties of
   the workpiece and/or abrasive particles. The approach adopted in this
   work relies on a Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2)
   framework, with specially tailored dominance operators to account for
   probabilistic aspects in the considered multiobjective problem.
   Deterministic benchmark problems in the literature for the considered
   machining processes are extended to include performance uncertainty, and
   then used in testing the performance of the proposed approach. Results
   of the study show that accounting for process variations through a
   simple penalty term may be detrimental for the multiobjective
   optimization. On the other hand, a proposed Fuzzy-tournament dominance
   operator appears to produce favorable results.}},

Abstract = {{Solar-powered water desalination is one of the promising approaches for
   addressing fresh water scarcity in the Middle East, North Africa, and
   areas of similar climate around the world.
   Humidification-dehumidification (HDH) is a scalable, commercially-viable
   technology that primarily utilizes thermal energy in order to extract
   fresh water from a high salinity water source. Because of inherent
   variability and uncertainty in solar energy availability due to daily
   and seasonal cycles, solar powered HDH desalination systems may benefit
   from installing thermal energy storage (TES). TES can allow higher
   utilization of the installed system components and thus reduce the
   overall lifecycle cost of fresh water production. This work presents a
   configuration for a HDH desalination system augmented by TES. The system
   is optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GA) for minimum total annual cost
   (TAC) per unit volume of produced potable water while satisfying a
   preset potable water demand. The optimum results for the same location
   and cost function are compared with results from a previous system which
   does not have TES. The comparison shows a considerable reduction in
   potable water production cost when TES is utilized in addition to the
   benefit of smaller variation in water production across the day.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a theoretical study on optimizing the mixing ratios
   of hydrocarbon blends to be used as refrigerants in existing
   refrigeration equipment. The primary objective is to maximize the
   coefficient of performance. The gas blending optimization problem is
   posed in a multi-objective framework, where the optimization seeks to
   generate Pareto optimal solutions that span the trade-off frontier
   between coefficient of performance versus deviation from a desired
   volumetric refrigeration capacity, while adhering to a maximum
   compression ratio. Design variables in the optimization are the mass
   fractions of hydrocarbon gases in the blend. A domain reduction scheme
   is introduced, which allows for efficient conduction of exhaustive
   search, with up to three hydrocarbon gases in the blend. While
   exhaustive search guarantees that the obtained solutions are global
   optima, the computational resources it requires scale poorly as the
   number of design variables increase. Two alternative approaches,
   (multi-start SQP) and (NSGA-II) are also tested for solving the
   optimization problem. Numerical simulation case studies for replacement
   of R12, R22 and R134a with hydrocarbon blends of isobutane, propane and
   propylene show agreement between solution methods that good compromises
   are possible to achieve, but a small loss in coefficient of performance
   is inevitable.}},

   good solutions can be extracted and used to constrain the solution
   space. Incorporating this constraint into the search enhances the

Abstract = {{A recent and promising technique to overcome the challenges of
   conventional drilling is vibration-assisted drilling (VAD) whereby a
   controlled harmonic motion is superimposed over the principal drilling
   feed motion in order to create an intermittent cutting state. Two
   additional variables other than the feed and the speed are introduced,
   namely the frequency and the amplitude of the imposed vibrations.
   Optimum selection of cutting conditions in VAD operations of composite
   materials is a challenging task due to several reasons; such as the
   increase in the number of controllable variables, the need for costly
   experimentation, and the limitation on the number of experiments that
   can be performed before tool degradation becomes an issue in the
   reliability of measurements. Additionally, there are often several
   objectives to consider, some of which may be conflicting, while others
   may be somewhat correlated. Pareto-optimality analysis is needed for
   conflicting objectives; however the existence of several objectives
   (high-dimension Pareto space) makes the generation and interpretation of
   Pareto solutions difficult. An attractive approach to the optimization
   task is thus to employ Kriging meta-models in a multi-objective
   efficient global optimization (m-EGO) framework for incremental
   experimentation of optimal setting of the cutting parameters. Additional
   challenge posed by constraints on machine capabilities is accounted for
   through domain transformation of the design variables prior to the
   construction of the Kriging models. Study results using a baseline
   exhaustive experimental data shows opportunity for employing m-EGO for
   the generation of well distributed Pareto-frontiers with fewer
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{A flexure strip has constraint characteristics, such as stiffness
   properties and error motions, that limit its performance as a basic
   constituent of flexure mechanisms. This paper presents a framework for
   modeling the deformation and stiffness characteristics of general
   threedimensional flexure strips that exhibit bending, shear and torsion
   deformation. The formulation is based on a finite strain discrete
   spatial beam element with refinements to account for plate-like behavior
   due to constrained cross-sectional warping. This framework is suited for
   analytical calculations thanks to the accuracy of the beam element,
   while its discrete nature allows for easy implementation in numeric
   software to serve as calculation aid. As case study, a closed-form
   parametric analytical expression is derived for the lateral support
   stiffness of a parallel flexure mechanism. This captures the
   deteriorating support stiffness when the mechanism moves in the intended
   degree of freedom. By incorporating relevant geometric nonlinearities
   and a warping constraint stiffening factor, an accurate
   load-displacement and stiffness expression for the lateral support
   direction is obtained. This result is verified by nonlinear finite
   element analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few decades, the increasing demand for self powered
   devices has led to an immense amount of research in the field of energy
   harvesting from renewable mechanical energies. Often, most of thee
   abundant energy sources are wasted in the form of structural vibrations,
   acoustic waves or impact energy. Recently, nano-electromechanical sys
   tens (NEMS) consisting of piezoelectric nanowires have shown excellent
   electromechanical coupling coefficients which can efficiently convert
   small amplitude vibrations into useful electrical energy for compact and
   low power wireless electronic devices. Specifically, high aspect ratio
   piezoelectric nanowires have shown to have a better deformability and
   hence produce higher piezoelectric response to low level induced stress.
   However, current materials are not well suited for energy harvesting
   from extreme environments. In this study, ultra-long high aspect ratio
   vertically aligned lead titanate nanowires (45 gm long, AR = 75) are
   synthesized through a two-step hydrothermal reaction in which s odium
   titanate nanowires serve as the precursor. Their application in
   harvesting vibrational energy at temperatures above 300 degrees C is
   demonstrated through the characterization of open circuit voltage and
   power measurements. The results show that the ultra-long vertically
   aligned lead titanate nanowire array energy harvester can produce up to
   22.3 mW m(-2) at room temperature and up to 13 mW m(-2) at 375 degrees
   C. Thus, it is shown that the energy harvester can provide enough energy
   density for many self-powered, high-temperature applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a linear-spring coupled nonlinear energy harvesting
   system, which contains linear piezoelectric energy harvesters coupled by
   linear springs. Although every element of the system is linear, the
   system will present nonlinear characteristics when it is subjected to
   excitations because of the geometric nonlinearity induced by coupled
   motions. Three non-uniform cross-section linear harvesters with the same
   total length and the different thickness are selected to form the
   proposed system. Based on Euler-Bernoulli beam assumptions and the
   geometrical relationship among each element, a detailed modeling process
   of the proposed system is presented. In order to verify the broadband
   characteristics, the comparison of the proposed system and its linear
   counterparts is provided. Under harmonic excitations, the proposed
   system has much better energy harvesting capacity compared with its
   linear counterparts. What's more, the energy harvesting performance of
   the proposed system is a little better than its linear counterparts
   under random excitations. The results demonstrate that the advantage of
   the proposed system is enhanced along with increased excitation level.
   In addition, such non-magnetic nonlinear energy harvesting system can be
   used in the areas where magnets are forbidden, such as inside the human
   body.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an application of the manufacturing constraint
   modeling (MCM) method we previously developed, to composite molding
   processes. A statistical model to predict resin filling time for given
   part geometry and inlet location is constructed through massive process
   simulations and data mining. A bitmap representation is adopted to
   generate massive samples of part geometries within a bounding box. The
   model is trained by the statistical regression based on the abstract
   features inspired by the underlying physics of the filling process,
   which dramatically enhances the model generalizability compared to the
   conventional surrogate models. The model is tested by in-the-bag samples
   and out-of bag samples with a different inlet gate location and a
   different bounding box. The result shows the manufacturing constraint
   model trained by the knowledge-inspired feature representation achieves
   comparable in-the-bag training errors as the surrogate models, and
   remarkably better out-of-bag testing results. The proposed manufacturing
   constraint model will be useful to enhance the manufacturability of
   composite structures during manual design iterations as well as
   computer-based optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Solution-processed silver nanowire (AgNW) random mesh is a strong
   contender to commercial indium tin oxide (ITO); however, its performance
   is limited due to large contact resistance between nanowires and
   post-processing treatments. As an alternative, long nanowires can
   decrease the number of contact points and contact resistance. Here, a
   simple modified hydrothermal method for the synthesis of very-long
   silver nanowires (AgNWs) and their use in a high quality transparent
   conducting electrode without post-processing has been developed. Well
   dispersed very-long and thin silver nanowires are synthesized by using
   glucose as a reducing agent and silver chloride as a silver source. The
   lengths of the wires are in the range of 200 to 500 mm with an average
   diameter of 45-65 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   report on long nanowires having a thin diameter with greater than 200
   microns length. As compared to other transparent conductors and nanowire
   networks, this AgNW network shows a higher percolative figure of merit
   (FoM, II) with low haze. A flexible touch screen using the AgNW network
   is also demonstrated which has shown good performance even on a bendable
   surface.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, numerical simulations are performed to investigate the
   effects of different configurations of dielectric SiO2 particles on the
   improvement of light absorption in 2-pm single crystal silicon
   photovoltaic solar cells. The numerical model is developed on the basis
   of the FDTD solution of the transient Maxwell equations and checked with
   analytical solutions for simple configurations and against experimental
   measurements of light absorption in bare Si films. The numerical model
   is also checked for mesh sensitivity such that the computed data are
   approximately mesh-insensitive. Computed results are analyzed and the
   short circuit current of the Si films is used as a measure of the
   efficiency for light trapping in Si films. Results show that with SiO2
   nanoparticles closely packed atop the Si film, good improvement in light
   absorption efficiency is achieved if the particle is 700 nm in diameter.
   This is considered to be attributed to the anti reflection effect of the
   particle layer and the whispering gallery mode of SiO2 particles excited
   by the incident light. If the closely arranged SiO2 nanoparticles are
   embedded half-way into a Si film through its top surface, the light
   absorption is enhanced by 120\%, approaching to the Yablonovitch limit.
   The structured surface of the Si film can almost realize 100\%
   anti-reflection of incident, because the use of the half embedded SiO2
   particles in the top layer of the Si film creates a graded transition of
   the effective refractive index along the direction of incident; and as a
   result almost all the light with the wavelength below or near 500nm are
   absorbed due to the higher imaginary part of the refractive index. The
   improvement in light absorption with the wavelength greater than 500nm
   comes, however, from the resonance behavior of the SiO2 nanoparticles.
   Experiments are now planned and measurements of light absorption will be
   conducted with a photospectrometer to validate the above calculations.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study is presented on designing and electrochemical
   fabrication of sandwich-structured NiO/Ni/NiO nanotube arrays for
   suppercapacitor applications. The electrochemical performance of
   different NiO based electrodes with different values of specific
   capacitance has been reported, including NiO film (similar to 309 F
   g(-1)){[}1], NiO nanosheets (similar to 600 F g(-1)){[}2], NiO nanotubes
   (similar to 266 F g(-1)){[}3] and NiO-TiO2 based nanotubes (similar to
   300 F g(-1)){[}4]. These reported pseudocapacitors are still far from
   the theoretical value of NiO based capacitance, which is largely
   attributed to the poor electronic conduction. To overcome this
   difficulty, we designed and fabricated novel sandwich-structured
   NiO/Ni/NiO nanotube arrays as pseudo capacitor electrodes on conductive
   substrates. Fabrication of these nanotube arrays starts with the growth
   of ZnO nanorods, which then act as sacrificial template. The Ni nanotube
   arrays subsequently are synthesized by electrodeposition of a Ni layer
   onto the surface of ZnO nanorods, followed by dissolving the sacrificial
   template in sodium hydroxide aqueous solution. The final
   sandwich-structured NiO/Ni/NiO nanotube arrays are then formed by
   annealing of the Ni nanotubes at temperature of 450 degrees C in air.
   The aspect ratio of the Ni nanotubes is conformable with the morphology
   of the ZnO nanorods template and their wall-thickness is determined by
   the electrodeposition. The thickness of the NiO layer can be further
   controlled by adjusting the processing parameters of the annealing
   process (i.e., time and temperature). The results of electrochemical
   tests, that is, the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic
   charge-discharge cycling measurements, show that the NiO/Ni/NiO
   sandwich-like nanotubes electrode clearly displays pseudo-capacitive
   behavior with improved capacitive performance. Experimental data suggest
   that the metal Ni core in the NiO/Ni/NiO sandwich-like nanotube
   structures uniquely serves as a channel for high electron transfer rate

Abstract = {{Gas ejectors can be found in a wide range of applications such as
   refrigeration and thrust augmentation. This paper focuses on the study
   of an ejector used in applications where moist gases are being
   entrained. In the first part of this work, the gas flow characteristics
   inside an ejector, as well as the ejector's performance under various
   operating and geometric configurations, were studied with a
   three-dimensional computational model, which was validated against
   measurement data.
   In the second part, focus was given to the potential condensation or
   de-sublimation phenomena that may occur inside an ejector when water
   vapor is included in the entrained stream. An experiment using
   light-attenuation method was performed to verify the presence of a
   second phase, then the onset of phase change and the phase distribution
   were obtained numerically. A two-dimensional axis-symmetric model was
   developed based on the model used in the first part. A series of
   simulations were performed with various amounts of water vapor added
   into the entrained flow. It was found that both frost particles and
   water condensate could form inside the mixing tube depending on the
   operating conditions and water vapor concentrations. When the
   concentration exceeds 3\%, water vapor could condense throughout the
   mixing tube. Some preliminary results of the second phase particles
   formed, e.g. critical sizes and distributions, were also obtained to
   assist with the design and optimization of gas ejectors used in similar
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we are exploring the influence of the design of air
   diffusers on a number of parameters that influence the thermal comfort
   of building occupants. In particular we are looking at calculating the
   Air Diffusion Performance Index (ADPI) and vertical temperature
   difference as well as the throw and drop parameters for various diffuser
   designs. The results show that while a complex radial vane diffuser that
   uses the Coanda effect could offer good performance if the HVAC system
   is used for cooling, the same design might not give any advantage as
   compared to a regular multi-cone design while the system is used for
   heating. This is mostly due to the strong air stratification observed
   for both diffuser designs, while the HVAC system is in the heating mode.
   Consequently we propose a better alternative, namely, to use a variable
   geometry (angle) air diffuser. To prove this concept we performed a CFD
   analysis of several diffusers, each delivering the air at different
   angles, for both heating and cooling mode, and we show that indeed using
   a design that allows changing the angle of the air jets between the
   heating and cooling season is the optimal way of delivering air to a
   room.}},

Abstract = {{Ankle-foot-orthosis (AFO) is a common assistive device orthoses to
   provide the support of the foot for users who have the drop foot
   syndrome. Custom AFOs offer better fit, comfort and functional
   performance than pre-fabricated ones. The 3D-printing technique is ideal
   for fabrication of personalized AFOs. Fused deposition modelling (FDM)
   is a 3D-printing method with the desired strength and material
   deposition rate for custom AFO applications. The process planning is
   critical for the cycle time and quality for FDM of AFOs. Four steps in
   the process planning are: 1) orientation determination, 2) support
   generation, 3) slicing and 4) tool path generation. In the orientation
   determination, several factors are taken into accounts to improve the
   printability and mechanical performance of the fabricated AFO. To reduce
   the support structure, structural optimizations are applied on the AFO
   part without compromising of the strength. Adaptive slicing strategy is
   used to slice the AFO with full consideration of its geometric
   characteristics. In the tool-path generation, wavy tool-path is
   developed to improve the manufacturing process and enhance the
   structural strength by parameters optimization. This study demonstrates
   the importance of path planning for FDM for custom AFOs. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Recent studies on periodic metamaterial systems have shown that
   remarkable properties adaptivity and multifunctionality are often
   products of exploiting internal, coexisting metastable states. Yet to
   realize such attractive potential, effecting coexisting metastable
   states in material systems may require the determination of a periodic
   constituent which promotes a non-uniqueness when composed within the
   whole system, thus creating a need for costly, multiscale design. To
   surmount such concerns, this research first focuses on the development
   of adaptable, metastable modules: once assembled into modular
   metastructures, synergistic properties adaptation is found to be a
   natural byproduct of the strategic module design. Using this approach,
   it is seen that modularity facilitates a direct pathway to create and
   effectively exploit metastable states for massive, metastructure
   properties adaptivity, including a near-continuous variation of
   mechanical properties or stable topologies and adjustable hysteresis. A
   model is developed to understand the source of the synergistic
   characteristics, and theoretical findings are found to be in good
   agreement with experimental results. Important design-based questions
   are raised regarding the modular metastructure concept, and a genetic
   algorithm routine is developed to elucidate the sensitivities of the
   properties variation with respect to the statistics among assembled
   module design variables. To obtain target multifunctionality and
   adaptivity, the routine discovers that particular degrees and types of
   modular heterogeneity are required. Future realizations of modular
   metastructures are discussed to illustrate the extensibility of the
   design concept and broad application base.}},

Abstract = {{Thermally responsive self-healing polyurethanes (1DA1T, 1.5DA1T, and
   2DA1H) with shape memory property were developed and the fully
   reversible Diels-Alder (DA) and retro Diels-Alder (rDA) reactions were
   employed for the healing mechanism. The transition temperatures of the
   DA and rDA reactions were confirmed through a differential scanning
   calorimetry and the molecular level of analysis on the reversibility and
   the repeatability between the DA and rDA reactions were completed though
   a variable temperature proton nuclear magnetic resonance at the reaction
   temperatures. Also, compact tension specimens were made to observe the
   healing efficiencies. These specimens were healed without the use of
   external forces to close the crack surfaces after testing for the
   repeatable healing ability with three cycles. As a result, the average
   first healing cycle efficiencies of 80\%, 84\%, and 96\% for 1DA1T,
   1.5DA1T and 2DA1H, respectively, were achieved and small drops for the
   second and third healing cycles were observed. Then, using two of the
   self-healing polyurethanes as resins, continuous carbon fiber fabric
   reinforced polymer matrix composites (C1.5DA1T and C2DA1H) were
   fabricated and short beam shear testing was conducted to determine the
   healing capability on the delamination. Accordingly, the first healing
   efficiencies of 88\% and 85\% were measured without any additional
   treatments on the fibers; however, an external pressure was applied
   during the composite healing process.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, space-borne observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide
   (CO2) have been increasingly used in global carbon-cycle studies. In
   order to obtain added value from space-borne measurements, they have to
   suffice stringent accuracy and precision requirements, with the latter
   being less crucial as it can be reduced by just enhanced sample size.
   Validation of CO2 column-averaged dry air mole fractions (XCO2) heavily
   relies on measurements of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network
   (TCCON). Owing to the sparseness of the network and the requirements
   imposed on space-based measurements, independent additional validation
   is highly valuable. Here, we use observations from the High-Performance
   Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER)
   Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) flights from 01/2009 through 09/2011
   to validate CO2 measurements from satellites (Greenhouse Gases Observing
   Satellite - GOSAT, Thermal Emission Sounder - TES, Atmospheric Infrared
   Sounder - AIRS) and atmospheric inversion models (CarbonTracker CT2013B,
   Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) v13r1). We find
   that the atmospheric models capture the XCO2 variability observed in
   HIPPO flights very well, with correlation coefficients (r(2)) of 0.93
   and 0.95 for CT2013B and MACC, respectively. Some larger discrepancies
   can be observed in profile comparisons at higher latitudes, in
   particular at 300aEuro-hPa during the peaks of either carbon uptake or
   release. These deviations can be up to 4aEuro-ppm and hint at
   misrepresentation of vertical transport.
   Comparisons with the GOSAT satellite are of comparable quality, with an
   r(2) of 0.85, a mean bias mu of -0.06aEuro-ppm, and a standard deviation
   sigma of 0.45aEuro-ppm. TES exhibits an r(2) of 0.75, mu of
   0.34aEuro-ppm, and sigma of 1.13aEuro-ppm. For AIRS, we find an r(2) of
   0.37, mu of 1.11aEuro-ppm, and sigma of 1.46aEuro-ppm, with
   latitude-dependent biases. For these comparisons at least 6, 20, and 50
   atmospheric soundings have been averaged for GOSAT, TES, and AIRS,
   respectively. Overall, we find that GOSAT soundings over the remote
   Pacific Ocean mostly meet the stringent accuracy requirements of about
   0.5aEuro-ppm for space-based CO2 observations.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, machine learning methods for empirical
   rainfall-runoff modeling have seen extensive development and been
   proposed as a useful complement to physical hydrologic models,
   particularly in basins where data to support process-based models are
   limited. However, the majority of research has focused on a small number
   of methods, such as artificial neural networks, despite the development
   of multiple other approaches for non-parametric regression in recent
   years. Furthermore, this work has often evaluated model performance
   based on predictive accuracy alone, while not considering broader
   objectives, such as model interpretability and uncertainty, that are
   important if such methods are to be used for planning and management
   decisions. In this paper, we use multiple regression and machine
   learning approaches (including generalized additive models, multivariate
   adaptive regression splines, artificial neural networks, random forests,
   and M5 cubist models) to simulate monthly streamflow in five highly
   seasonal rivers in the highlands of Ethiopia and compare their
   performance in terms of predictive accuracy, error structure and bias,
   model interpretability, and uncertainty when faced with extreme climate
   conditions. While the relative predictive performance of models differed
   across basins, data-driven approaches were able to achieve reduced
   errors when compared to physical models developed for the region.
   Methods such as random forests and generalized additive models may have
   advantages in terms of visualization and interpretation of model
   structure, which can be useful in providing insights into physical
   watershed function. However, the uncertainty associated with model
   predictions under extreme climate conditions should be carefully
   evaluated, since certain models (especially generalized additive models
   and multivariate adaptive regression splines) become highly variable
   when faced with high temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Effective electrification of automotive vehicles requires designing the
   powertrain's configuration along with sizing its components for a
   particular vehicle type.. Employing planetary gear systems in hybrid
   electric vehicle powertrain architectures allows various architecture
   alternatives to be explored, including single mode architectures that
   are based on a fixed configuration and multi-mode architectures that
   allow switching power flow configuration during vehicle operation.
   Previous studies have addressed the configuration and sizing problems
   separately. However, the two problems are coupled and must be optimized
   together to achieve system optimality. An all-in-one system solution
   approach to the combined problem is not viable due to the high
   complexity of the resulting optimization problem. In this paper we
   propose a partitioning and coordination strategy based on Analytical
   Target Cascading for simultaneous design of powertrain configuration and
   sizing for given vehicle applications. The capability of the proposed
   design framework is demonstrated by designing powertrains with one and
   two planetary gears for a mid-size passenger vehicle.}},

Title = {{Supplier selection in closed loop supply chain by an integrated
   simulation-Taguchi-DEA approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{29}},

Pages = {{302-326}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Reverse logistics refer to processes related to the reuse of
   products. The role of suppliers' performance is crucial in achieving
   quality, cost, service and delivery aims of a supply chain. The
   selection of suppliers is regarded as one of the critical issues
   encountered by purchasing and operations managers in a supply chain to
   enhance organization's global marketplace competitiveness. Most of the
   supply chain models are rather complex problems. Consequently, it is
   impossible to propose systematic models to handle them. Therefore, in
   this paper a new integrated approach based on experimental design and
   computer simulation is proposed for supplier selection. The paper aims
   to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study, a simulation approach is
   implemented to determine certain equivalent of parameters values in a
   CLSC network design which cannot be computed through mathematical model.
   Suppliers' order quantities are investigated by Taguchi method for
   planning time horizon. Moreover, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is
   applied to assess suppliers based on quality, cost, delivery time,
   production capabilities, services and technology.
   Findings - In the numerical example, there are three suppliers for
   different regions. Purchase value of each supplier is measured in three
   years successively. According to the proposed method, the authors find
   the minimum level of costs together with the maximum number of
   high-quality products.
   Practical implications - The objective functions of model are minimizing
   the costs and maximizing number of high-quality products. The integrated
   approach introduced in this paper enables managers to select their
   suppliers effectively in their real system.
   Originality/value - Most supply chain models are complex and the
   identification of proper and optimal solutions in complex real-world
   systems often requires the solution of multi-objective problems
   involving multiple stochastic variables. Therefore, the paper introduces
   a new integrated approach for supplier selection in closed loop supply
   chain. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first study
   that integrates DEA, computer simulation and Taguchi method for supplier
   selection in closed loop supply chains.}},

Title = {{Battery Capacity Fading Estimation Using a Force-Based Incremental
   Capacity Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{A1584-A1594}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally health monitoring techniques in lithium-ion batteries rely
   on voltage and current measurements. A novel method of using a
   mechanical rather than electrical signal in the incremental capacity
   analysis (ICA) method is introduced in this paper. This method derives
   the incremental capacity curves based on measured force (ICF) instead of
   voltage (ICV). The force is measured on the surface of a cell under
   compression in a fixture that replicates a battery pack assembly and
   preloading. The analysis is performed on data collected from cycling
   encased prismatic Lithium-ion Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt Oxide (NMC) cells.
   For the NMC chemistry, the ICF method can complement or replace the ICV
   method for the following reasons. The identified ICV peaks are centered
   around 40\% of state of charge (SOC) while the peaks of the ICF method
   are centered around 70\% of SOC indicating that the ICF can be used more
   often because it is more likely that an electric vehicle (EV) or a
   plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) will traverse the 70\% SOC range
   than the 40\% SOC. In addition the Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) of the
   force signal is four times larger than the voltage signal using
   laboratory grade sensors. The proposed ICF method is shown to achieve
   0.42\% accuracy in capacity estimation during a low C-rate constant
   current discharge. Future work will investigate the application of the
   capacity estimation technique under charging and operation under high
   C-rates by addressing the transient behavior of force so that an online
   methodology for capacity estimation is developed. The Author(s) 2016.

Title = {{Anodic Hydrogen Evolution and Localized Corrosion during Galvanostatic
   Polarization of a Peak-Aged Mg-Y-Nd-Zr Alloy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{C402-C409}},
Abstract = {{The hydrogen evolution response on a peak-aged Mg-Y-Nd-Zr (WE43) Mg
   alloy in a 0.1M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution under galvanostatic
   polarization is investigated by collecting the evolved hydrogen gas and
   microstructure characterization techniques. The hydrogen evolution rate
   increases not only with increasing applied cathodic current density, but
   also with increasing applied anodic current density, indicative of the
   so-called negative difference effect (NDE). Localized corrosion is
   induced by anodic polarization and is the site where rising streams of
   hydrogen gas evolve. Cross sectional characterization of the regions
   where localized corrosion initiates reveals inward growth and a porous
   Mg(OH)(2) structure with a finger-like propagation front. Neither a
   film-free region, nor an enrichment of impurity elements was observed at
   the localized corrosion regions. In addition, no increase in the
   cathodic activity was observed when comparing samples with and without
   prior anodic polarization, indicating that the enhanced catalytic
   activity of the corrosion product may not play a dominant role in the
   NDE on peak-aged Mg-Y-Nd-Zr. The relationship between the abnormal
   hydrogen evolution and the localized corrosion morphology is discussed.

Journal = {{MATERIALS RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{75-82}},
Abstract = {{A series of helium (He) implantations with varying energies and doses
   were used to introduce bubbles into interfaces in Cu/Mo, Cu/V and Cu/Nb
   nanolayered composites. Micro-pillar compression testing revealed that
   the interfacial He bubbles give rise to modest hardening as compared to
   those in grain interiors. The flow stress enhancement is proportional to
   the strength of the un-implanted sample. We discuss the influence of the
   structure of the interfacial dislocation network, the shear resistance
   of the interfaces, and atomic-level interface steps on hardening.
   Interfaces with higher density of misfit dislocation intersections and
   lower shear resistance tend to provide greater hardening.}},

Title = {{An Improved Approach for Estimating the Hyperparameters of the Kriging
   Model for High-Dimensional Problems through the Partial Least Squares
   Method}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{During the last years, kriging has become one of the most popular
   methods in computer simulation and machine learning. Kriging models have
   been successfully used in many engineering applications, to approximate
   expensive simulation models. When many input variables are used, kriging
   is inefficient mainly due to an exorbitant computational time required
   during its construction. To handle high-dimensional problems (100+), one
   method is recently proposed that combines kriging with the Partial Least
   Squares technique, the so-called KPLS model. This method has shown
   interesting results in terms of saving CPU time required to build model
   while maintaining sufficient accuracy, on both academic and industrial
   problems. However, KPLS has provided a poor accuracy compared to
   conventional kriging on multimodal functions. To handle this issue, this
   paper proposes adding a new step during the construction of KPLS to
   improve its accuracy for multimodal functions. When the exponential
   covariance functions are used, this step is based on simple
   identification between the covariance function of KPLS and kriging. The
   developed method is validated especially by using a multimodal academic
   function, known as Griewank function in the literature, and we show the
   gain in terms of accuracy and computer time by comparing with KPLS and
   kriging.}},

Title = {{Modeling Crack Propagation in Polycrystalline Microstructure Using
   Variational Multiscale Method}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Crack propagation in a polycrystalline microstructure is analyzed using
   a novel multiscale model. The model includes an explicit microstructural
   representation at critical regions (stress concentrators such as notches
   and cracks) and a reduced order model that statistically captures the
   microstructure at regions far away from stress concentrations. Crack
   propagation is modeled in these critical regions using the variational
   multiscale method. In this approach, a discontinuous displacement field
   is added to elements that exceed the critical values of normal or
   tangential tractions during loading. Compared to traditional cohesive
   zone modeling approaches, the method does not require the use of any
   special interface elements in the microstructure and thus can model
   arbitrary crack paths. The capability of the method in predicting both
   intergranular and transgranular failure modes in an elastoplastic
   polycrystal is demonstrated under tensile and three-point bending loads.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to image through a scattering or diffusive medium such as
   tissue or hazy atmosphere is a goal which has garnered extensive
   attention from the scientific community. Existing imaging methods in
   this field make use of phase conjugation, time of flight, iterative
   wave-front shaping or statistical averaging approaches, which tend to be
   either time consuming or complicated to implement. We introduce a novel
   and practical way of statistical averaging which makes use of a rotating
   ground glass diffuser to nullify the adverse effects caused by speckle
   introduced by a first static diffuser / aberrator. This is a Fourier
   transform-based, holographic approach which demonstrates the ability to
   recover detailed images and shows promise for further remarkable
   improvement. The present experiments were performed with 2D flat images,
   but this method could be easily adapted for recovery of 3D extended
   object information. The simplicity of the approach makes it fast,
   reliable, and potentially scalable as a portable technology. Since
   imaging through a diffuser has direct applications in biomedicine and
   defense technologies this method may augment advanced imaging
   capabilities in many fields.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we take a close look at the participation of women in
   Mechanical Engineering, through an analysis of scientific publications
   in the field. Using a large dataset of over 100,000 publications from
   the ASME digital library, the paper creates a picture of the gender
   preferences associated with areas in the field of Mechanical
   Engineering. We find that while the average percentage of women in the
   field is generally low (15.6\%), there are significant differences
   between the percentages of women in different categories, with areas
   such as biomechanical engineering, energy management, renewable energy,
   and nanotechnology attracting a larger than average proportion of women.
   Additionally, we also analyze the change in the number of authors in
   different areas over 20 years of research in the field, and observe a
   significant growth in recent years for both genders in the areas of
   biomechanical engineering, nanotechnology, and computational

Abstract = {{The 1T phase of MoS2 is attracting much attention due to its metallic
   property and potential applications for supercapacitors, photothermal
   agents, and memristors. However, because the 1T phase is metastable, it
   can easily be transferred to the stable 2H phase by heating. In this
   work, it is the first time we observe the mechanically-induced reverse
   phase transformation (from stable 2H to metastable 1T) for MoS2 by
   HAADF-STEM images. Furthermore, XPS revealed that the content of the 1T
   phase increased with increasing mechanical ball-milling time.
   Furthermore, the mechanically generated 1T MoS2 exhibited memristive
   behavior.}},

Title = {{The effect of wall depletion and hydrodynamic interactions on
   stress-gradient-induced polymer migration}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{5883-5897}},
Abstract = {{We generalize our recent continuum theory for the
   stress-gradient-induced migration of polymers {[}Zhu et al., J. Rheol.,
   2016, 60, 327-343] by incorporating the effect of solid boundaries on
   concentration variations. For a model flow in a channel with periodic
   slip wall velocity, which can in principle be produced by an electric
   field in the presence of a sinusoidal wall charge, we obtain theoretical
   results for the steady-state distribution of dilute solutions of polymer
   dumbbells using a systematic perturbation analysis in Weissenberg number
   Wi. We find that the presence of a thin wall depletion zone changes the
   lowest order solution from second to first in Wi and drastically affects
   the concentration field far from the depletion layer, due both to a
   coupling of the second derivative of the velocity field to the
   concentration gradient, and to convection of the polymer-depleted fluid
   in this layer into the bulk of the fluid. Additional effects induced by
   wall hydrodynamic interaction (HI) are assessed by incorporating polymer
   flux from the wall-HI migration theory of Ma and Graham into our
   continuum theory. We establish the range of validity of our theory by
   comparing the theoretical results with Brownian dynamics (BD)
   simulations: excellent agreement is achieved for relatively small
   molecules, while the theory breaks down when the Gradient number Gd is
   greater than 0.5, where Gd is the ratio of polymer coil size to the
   length scale over which the velocity gradient changes. The BD
   simulations are also extended to the case of long Hookean chains with
   numbers of springs per chain ranging from 1 to 32, where it is found
   that for fixed Gd and Wi, the results are nearly identical, showing that
   all important phenomena are captured by a simple dumbbell model, thus
   supporting the continuum theory which was derived for the case of
   dumbbells. In addition, the Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRD) method is
   employed to evaluate the role of HI on the migration pattern, producing
   effects consistent with the continuum theory incorporating the
   wall-migration flux. In general, we demonstrate that the polymer
   concentrates in drastically different regions of the channel depending
   on Gd and Wi.}},

Journal = {{ANALYST}},

Pages = {{4100-4107}},
Abstract = {{A photoionization detector (PID) is widely used as a gas chromatography
   (GC) detector. By virtue of its non-destructive nature, multiple PIDs
   can be used in multi-dimensional GC. However, different PIDs have
   different responsivities towards the same chemical compound with the
   same concentration or mass due to different aging conditions of the PID
   lamps and windows. Here, we carried out a systematic study regarding the
   response of 5 Krypton mu PIDs in a 1 x 4-channel 2-dimensional mu GC
   system to 7 different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with the
   ionization potential ranging from 8.45 eV to 10.08 eV and the
   concentration ranging from similar to 1 ng to similar to 2000 ng. We
   used one of the PIDs as the reference detector and calculated the
   calibration factor for each of the remaining 4 PIDs against the first
   PID, which we found is quite uniform regardless of the analyte, its
   concentration, or chromatographic peak width. Based on the above
   observation, we were able to quantitatively reconstruct the coeluted
   peaks in the first dimension using the signal obtained with a PID array
   in the second dimension. Our work will enable rapid and in situ
   calibration of PIDs in a GC system using a single analyte at a single
   concentration. It will also lead to the development of multi-channel
   multi-dimensional GC where multiple PIDs are employed.}},

Pages = {{2228-2235}},
Abstract = {{Chlorophylls are essential for photosynthesis and also one of the most
   abundant pigments on earth. Using an optofluidic ring resonator of
   extremely high Q-factors (>10(7)), we investigated the unique
   characteristics and underlying mechanism of chlorophyll lasers.
   Chlorophyll lasers with dual lasing bands at 680 nm and 730 nm were
   observed for the first time in isolated chlorophyll a (Chla).
   Particularly, a laser at the 730 nm band was realized in 0.1 mM Chla
   with a lasing threshold of only 8 mu J mm(-2). Additionally, we observed
   lasing competition between the two lasing bands. The presence of laser
   emission at the 680 nm band can lead to quenching or significant
   reduction of laser emission at the 730 nm band, effectively increasing
   the lasing threshold for the 730 nm band. Further
   concentration-dependent studies, along with theoretical analysis,
   elucidated the mechanism that determines when and why the laser emission
   band appears at one of the two bands, or concomitantly at both bands.
   Finally, Chla was exploited as the donor in fluorescence resonance
   energy transfer to extend the laser emission to the near infrared regime
   with an unprecedented wavelength shift as large as 380 nm. Our work will
   open a door to the development of novel biocompatible and biodegradable
   chlorophyll-based lasers for various applications such as miniaturized
   tunable coherent light sources and in vitro/in vivo biosensing. It will
   also provide important insight into the chlorophyll fluorescence and
   photosynthesis processes inside plants.}},

Abstract = {{Cell and growth factor-based tissue engineering has shown great
   potentials for skeletal regeneration. This study tested its feasibility
   in reconstructing large mandibular defects and compared the efficacy of
   varied construction materials and sealing methods. Bilateral mandibular
   critical-size (5-cm(3)) defects were created on six 4-month-old domestic
   pigs, and grafted with beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta TCP) only
   (Group-A), beta TCP with autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
   cells (BM-MSCs) (Group-B), and beta TCP with BM-MSCs and biodegradable
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres containing bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF) (Group-C). The buccal sides of Groups-B/-C were either sealed by
   fibrin sealant or by a biodegradable PLGA barrier membrane before
   soft-tissue closure. Computed tomography (CT), microCT and histology
   analyses were performed 12 weeks postoperatively. In vitro data
   demonstrated that BM-MSCs, with MSC properties confirmed, remained vital
   after integration with beta TCP; and PLGA microspheres exhibited an
   initial burst followed by slow and continuous release of growth factors
   over a period of 28 days. In vivo data demonstrated that Group-B/-C
   sites had significantly greater gap obliteration, higher tissue mineral
   densities and more residual beta TCP granules (p<0.05, Kruskal-Wallis
   tests). Qualitatively, Group-B/-C defect sites had started remodeling
   while Group-A sites were mainly forming new bone to bridge the gaps.
   Furthermore, beta TCP degradation was not mediated by macrophages or
   osteoclasts, and was significantly slowed down by sealing the defects
   with barrier membrane. Combined, these data present a promising
   formulation composed of beta TCP granules, autologous MSCs,
   controlled-release growth factors and biodegradable PLGA barrier
   membrane for the reconstruction of critical-size mandibular defects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper mainly discussed the effect of bio-carrier filling rate on
   the oxygen transfer coefficient of different diffusers in the MBBR
   process. The results show that bio-carriers could increase the oxygen
   transfer coefficients of the microporous diffusers both in clean water
   and in mixed liquor because of the shearing effect that created
   microbubbles and enhanced microscopic hydrodynamic flow regime of the
   reactor. Compared to the test without bio-carriers, dosing bio-carriers
   could increase the oxygen transfer coefficient of microporous membrane
   diffuser by 10.78\% in clean water and 10.17\% in mixed liquor. Dosing
   bio-carriers could increase the oxygen transfer coefficient of the
   campanulate corundum aerator and perforated pipe more than the
   microporous membrane diffuser. Compared to the control, dosing
   bio-carriers could increase the K-La of campanulate corundum aerator and
   perforated pipe diffuser by almost 13.40 and 17.74\% in clean water, and
   10.97 and 20.14\% in mixed liquor, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Rounding linear programs using techniques from discrepancy is a recent
   approach that has been very successful in certain settings. However this
   method also has some limitations when compared to approaches such as
   randomized and iterative rounding. We provide an extension of the
   discrepancy-based rounding algorithm due to Lovett-Meka that (i)
   combines the advantages of both randomized and iterated rounding, (ii)
   makes it applicable to settings with more general combinatorial
   structure such as matroids. As applications of this approach, we obtain
   new results for various classical problems such as linear system
   rounding, degree-bounded matroid basis and low congestion routing.}},

Abstract = {{3D cell culture in the extracellular matrix (ECM), which not only
   provides structural support to cellular constituents, but also initiates
   regulatory biochemical cues for a variety of important cell functions in
   tissue, has become more and more important in understanding cancer
   pathology and drug testing. Although the ECM-gel has been used in cell
   culture both in bulk and on-chip, previous studies focused on collective
   cell behavior rather than single-cell heterogeneity. To track the
   behavior of each individual cell, we have developed a gel-island chip,
   which can form thousands of islands containing single cells encapsulated
   by the desired ECM. Optimized by Poisson's distribution, the device can
   attain 34\% single cell capture efficiency of the exact number of single
   cells per island. A good culture media exchange rate and high cell
   viability can be achieved in the gel-islands. The cells in the islands
   can be automatically counted for high-throughput analysis. As a proof of
   concept, we monitored the proliferation and differentiation of single
   Notch+ (stem-like) T47D breast cancer cells. The 3D collagen gel
   environment was found to be favorable for the stem-like phenotype
   through better self-renewal and de-differentiation (Notch-to Notch+
   transition). More interestingly, we found that the
   Notch-de-differentiated cells were more resistant to doxorubicin and
   cisplatin than the Notch+ cells. Combining the 3D ECM culture and single
   cell resolution, the presented platform can automatically analyze the
   individual cell behaviors of hundreds of cells using a small amount of
   drug and reagents.}},

   possible applications}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{11827-11833}},
Abstract = {{According to the Mermin-Wagner theorem and theory of elasticity,
   long-range order in two-dimensional (2D) crystals will be inevitably
   destroyed due to a thermal fluctuation. Thus, a 2D lattice prefers a
   corrugation meaning that a 2D crystal is easy to present a ripple. In
   this work, we, via employing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
   simulations, for the first time evidenced that the inherent dynamics of
   phosphorene would lead to a spontaneous formation of ripples at room
   temperature. The height of a ripple closely associates with the
   temperature and the width. Via density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations, we further demonstrated that the emergence of ripples
   would remarkably reduce the bandgap of phosphorene. Via the construction
   of the unique phosphorene structure, we finally found that such a
   rippled structure is expected to be used in the light-emitting field.
   These results give us further knowledge of phosphorene, which goes
   beyond the current scope of phosphorene limited to the flat lattice.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an air-couple ultrasound detector based on an optical fluidic
   ring resonator (OFRR) suspended on a U-shaped holder. The OFRR is a
   glass capillary with an outer diameter of approximately 130 mu m and a
   wall thickness in the order of 1-10 mu m. The circular cross section of
   the OFRR supports the high-Q whispering gallery mode (WGM) that
   circulates along the circumference. Incoming ultrasound pressure results
   in a small refractive index change in the glass wall and geometrical
   change in the OFRR shape, both of which in turn lead to a spectral shift
   in the WGM that can be sensitively detected owing to WGM with high
   optical Q-factors (>10(7)). Due to the suspension nature of the OFRR,
   the ultrasound detection can be carried out in air, which is
   advantageous in comparison with other ultrasound detections that require
   acoustic coupling media such water, gel or solid. The sensitivity can be
   tuned and optimized by changing the diameter and wall thickness. Besides
   the optical detection, we also demonstrate optomechanical ultrasound
   mixing, in which optomechanical vibration is first excited within the
   OFRR that subsequently modulates the ultrasound wave. Our work will lead
   to the development of a new type of air-coupled ultrasound detector that
   can be used for photo-acoustic imaging, non-invasive ultrasound
   detection of external objects, and ultrasound detection/characterization
   of internal objects (such as particles and liquids) flowing inside the
   capillary.}},

Abstract = {{Crohn's disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease, which may cause
   obstructing intestinal strictures due to inflammation, fibrosis

   different stages of the disease progression is still challenging. In
   this work, we indicated the feasibility of non-invasively characterizing
   intestinal strictures using photoacoustic imaging (PAI), utilizing the
   uniquely optical absorption of hemoglobin and collagen. Surgically
   removed human intestinal stricture specimens were investigated with a
   prototype PAI system. 2D PA images with acoustic resolution at
   wavelength 532, 1210 and 1310 nm were formulated, and furthermore, the
   PA histochemical components images which show the microscopic
   distributions of histochemical components were solved. Imaging
   experiments on surgically removed human intestinal specimens has
   demonstrated the solved PA images were significantly different
   associated with the presence of fibrosis, which could be applied to
   characterize the intestinal strictures for given specimens.}},

   demonstrated the feasibility of micro-ring, an ultrasonic detector with

   were compared with a commercial hydrophone. In order to further verify
   the capability of micro-ring, spectrum of single micro-spheres with

Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been extensively explored as a model
   nanostmcture in nanomedicine and have been widely used to provide
   advanced biomedical research tools in diagnostic imaging and therapy.
   Due to the necessity of targeting AuNPs to individual cells, evaluation
   and visualization of AuNPs in the cellular level is critical to fully
   understand their interaction with cellular environment. Currently
   imaging technologies, such as fluorescence microscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy all have advantages and disadvantages. In this
   paper, we synthesized AuNPs by femtosecond pulsed laser ablation,
   modified their surface chemistry through sequential bioconjugation, and
   targeted the functionalized AuNPs with individual cancer cells. Based on
   their high optical absorption contrast, we developed a novel, label-free
   imaging method to evaluate and visualize intracellular AuNPs using
   photoacoustic microscopy (PAM). Preliminary study shows that the PAM
   imaging technique is capable of imaging cellular uptake of AuNPs in vivo
   at single-cell resolution, which provide an important tool for the study
   of AuNPs in nanomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) provides a unique tool to diagnose
   inflammatory arthritis. However, the specificity and sensitivity of PAT
   based on endogenous contrasts is limited. The development of contrast
   enhanced PAT imaging modalities in combination with small molecule
   contrast agents could lead to improvements in diagnosis and treatment of
   joint disease. Accordingly, we adapted and tested a PAT clinical imaging
   system for imaging the human joints, in combination with a novel PAT
   contrast agent derived from an FDA-approved small molecule drug. Imaging
   results based on a photoacoustic and ultrasound (PA/US) dual-modality
   system revealed that this contrast-enhanced PAT imaging system may offer
   additional information beyond single-modality PA or US imaging system,
   for the imaging, diagnosis and assessment of inflammatory arthritis.}},

Abstract = {{Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease
   affecting 30\% of the population in the United States. Biopsy is the
   gold standard for diagnosing NAFLD. Liver histology assesses the amount
   of fat, and determines type and extent of cell injury, inflammation and
   fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is invasive and is limited by sampling
   error. Current radiological diagnostic modalities can evaluate the
   `physical' morphology in liver by quantifying the backscattered US
   signals, but cannot interrogate the `histochemical' components forming
   these backscatterers. For example, ultrasound (US) imaging can detect
   the presence of fat but cannot differentiate steatosis alone from
   steatohepatitis. Our previous study of photoacoustic physiochemical
   analysis (PAPCA) has demonstrated that this method can characterize the
   histological changes in livers during the progression of NAFLD in animal
   models. In this study, we will further validate PAPCA with human livers.
   Ex vivo human liver samples with steatosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis will
   be scanned using optical illumination at wavelengths of 680-1700 nm and
   compared to histology results. In vivo study on human subjects with
   confirmed steatosis is planned using our PA-ultrasound (US) parallel
   imaging system based on Verasonic US imaging flatform with an L7-4
   probe. 10 mJ/cm(2) per pulse optical energy at 755 nm will be delivered
   to the skin surface, which is under the safety limit of American
   National Standard Institute. Preliminary study with ex vivo human tissue
   has demonstrated the potential of the proposed approach in
   differentiating human liver conditions.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decades, prostate cancer (PCa), with an annual incident
   rate much higher than any other cancer, is the most commonly diagnosed
   cancer in American men. PCa has a relatively low progression rate yet
   the survival percentage decreases dramatically once the cancer has
   metastasized. Identifying aggressive from indolent PCa to prevent
   metastasis and death is critical to improve outcomes for patients with
   PCa. Standard procedure for assessing the aggressiveness of PCa involves
   the removal of tumor tissues by transrectal (TR) ultrasound (US) guided
   needle biopsy. The microscopic architecture of the biopsied tissue is
   visualized by histological or immunohistochemical staining procedures.
   The heterogeneity of the microscopic architecture is characterized by a
   Gleason score, a quantitative description of the aggressiveness of PCa.
   Due to the inability to identify the cancer cells, most noninvasive
   imaging modalities can only provide diagnosis of PCa at limited
   accuracy. This study investigates the feasibility of identifying PCa
   tumors and characterizing the aggressiveness of PCa by photoacoustic
   imaging assisted by cancer targeting polyacrylamide (PAA) nanoparticles
   (NPs). PAA is a biocompatible material used in clinics for the past 20
   years. PAA NPs can protect capsulated optical contrast agents from
   interference by enzymes and enable prolonged systematic circulation in
   the living biological environment. The cancer targeting mechanism is
   achieved by conjugating the NPs to F3 peptides, which trace nucleolin
   overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. Preliminary studies have
   shown that the NPs are capable of staining the PCa cells in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Intraocular tumors are life-threatening conditions. Long-term mortality
   from uveal melanoma, which accounts for 80\% of primary intraocular
   tumors, could be as high as 25\% depending on the size, ciliary body
   involvement and extraocular extension. The treatments of intraocular
   tumors include eye-sparing approaches such as radiotherapy and
   thermotherapy, and the more aggressive enucleation. The accurate
   diagnosis of intraocular tumors is thereby critical in the management
   and follow-up of the patients. The diagnosis of intraocular tumors is
   usually based on clinical examination with acoustic backscattering based
   ultrasonography. By analyzing the high frequency fluctuations within the
   ultrasound (US) signals, microarchitecture information inside the tumor
   can be characterized. However, US cannot interrogate the histochemical
   components formulating the microarchitecture. One representative example
   is the inability of US imaging (and other contemporary imaging
   modalities as well) in differentiating nevoid and melanoma cells as the
   two types of cells possesses similar acoustic backscattering properties.
   Combining optical and US imaging, photoacoustic (PA) measurements encode
   both the microarchitecture and histochemical component information in
   biological tissue. This study attempts to characterize ocular tumors by
   analyzing the high frequency signal components in the multispectral PA
   images. Ex vivo human eye globes with melanoma and retinoblastoma tumors
   were scanned using less than 6 mJ per square centimeters laser energy
   with tunable range of 600-1700 nm. A PA-US parallel imaging system with
   US probes CL15-7 and L22-14 were used to acquire the high frequency PA
   signals in real time. Preliminary results show that the proposed method
   can identify uveal melanoma against retinoblastoma tumors.}},

Pages = {{5199-5204}},
Abstract = {{Depletion interactions arise from entropic forces, and their ability to
   induce aggregation and even ordering of colloidal particles through
   self-assembly is well established, especially for spherical colloids. We
   vary the size and concentration of penetrable hard sphere depletants in
   a system of cuboctahedra, and we show how depletion changes the
   preferential facet alignment of the colloids and thereby selects
   different crystal structures. Moreover, we explain the cuboctahedra
   phase behavior using perturbative free energy calculations. We find that
   cuboctahedra can form a stable simple cubic phase, and, remarkably, that
   the stability of this phase can be rationalized only by considering the
   effects of both the colloid and depletant entropy. We corroborate our
   results by analyzing how the depletant concentration and size affect the
   emergent directional entropic forces and hence the effective particle
   shape. We propose the use of depletants as a means of easily changing
   the effective shape of self-assembling anisotropic colloids.}},

Title = {{Oxidative coupling of methane over mixed oxide catalysts designed for
   solid oxide membrane reactors}},
Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{4370-4376}},
Abstract = {{Oxidative coupling of methane is a process that converts methane
   directly to C-2 products (ethane and ethylene). One of the problems with
   the technology is that the selectivity and yield to the desired C-2
   products is prohibitively low when conventional plug flow reactors are
   employed. The main reasons for the low C-2 selectivity are the
   thermodynamic and kinetic preference for undesired products (CO and
   CO2), which are formed through direct methane combustion and sequential
   ethane and ethylene oxidation. These unselective processes are
   particularly problematic at high O-2 partial pressures (low CH4/O-2
   ratios). In order to achieve higher C-2 selectivity, plug flow membrane
   reactors, utilizing O2- conducting oxide membranes, can be utilized. The
   optimal design of a membrane reactor for OCM would, in addition to the
   membrane, include a catalyst that is active and selective under the
   relevant operating conditions, and that can be seamlessly integrated
   with the membrane. In this contribution we have identified and tested
   several mixed oxide catalysts which could be integrated into a solid
   oxide membrane reactor. The tested catalysts included lanthanum gallate
   doped with strontium and magnesium (La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta, LSGM),
   lanthanum manganite doped with strontium (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta, LSM) and
   lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta, LSCF).
   We show that LSGM and LSGM doped with lithium reached over 90\%
   selectivity to the C2+ products at high CH4/O-2 operating ratios which
   are applicable to membrane reactor designs. We have characterized these
   materials and discussed the strategies for their integration into a
   membrane reactor system.}},

Abstract = {{Various types of collagens, e.g. type I and III, represent the main
   load-bearing components in biological tissues. Their composition changes
   during processes like wound healing and fibrosis. Collagens exhibit
   autofluorescence when excited by ultra-violet light, distinguishable by
   their unique fluorescent lifetimes across a range of emission
   wavelengths. Therefore, we designed a miniaturized spectral-lifetime
   detection system for collagens as a non-invasive probe for monitoring
   tissue in wound healing and scarring applications. A sine modulated LED
   illumination was applied to enable frequency domain (FD) fluorescence
   lifetime measurements under different wavelengths bands, separated via a
   series of longpass dichroics at 387nm, 409nm and 435nm. To achieve the
   minute scale of optomechanics, we employed a stereolithography based 3D
   printer with <50 mu m resolution to create a custom designed optical
   mount in a hand-held form factor. We examined the characteristics of the
   3D printed optical system with finite element modeling to simulate the
   effect of thermal (LED) and mechanical (handling) strain on the optical
   system. Using this device, the phase shift and demodulation of collagen
   types were measured, where the separate spectral bands enhanced the
   differentiation of their lifetimes.}},

Abstract = {{Regularization is an effective strategy for reducing noise in
   tomographic reconstruction. This paper proposes a spatially weighted
   non-convex (SWNC) regularization method for digital breast tomosynthesis
   (DBT) image reconstruction. With a non-convex cost function, this method
   can suppress noise without blurring microcalcifications (MC) and
   spiculations of masses. To minimize the non-convex cost function, we
   apply a majorize-minimize separable quadratic surrogate algorithm
   (MM-SQS) that is further accelerated by ordered subsets (OS). We applied
   the new method to a heterogeneous breast phantom and to human subject
   DBT data, and observed improved image quality in both situations. A
   quantitative study also showed that the SWNC method can significantly
   enhance the contrast-to-noise ratio of MCs. By properly selecting its
   parameters, the SWNC regularizer can preserve the appearance of the mass
   margins and breast parenchyma.}},

Abstract = {{High precision contouring is important in machining. A practically
   proven method to improve contouring precision is adding a cross-coupling
   algorithm, which acts on contour error, to the existing position control
   loops. The contour error estimate (CEE) significantly affects
   performance of the cross-coupling algorithm. Conventional CEE methods
   rely on static single-point algorithms. A Newton-based CEE algorithm
   which effectively improves CEE and dramatically reduces contouring error
   has recently been proposed {[}22]. In this paper, instead of a separate
   cross-coupling control it is proposed to modify the position control
   loops, in this case integral sliding mode control, to incorporate the
   contour error in the control loop. Various experiments to identify the
   effect of 1) number of required iterations of the Newton-based CEE, 2)
   reference feedrate and curvature, and 3) sharp corners on overall
   performance of the proposed cross-coupling algorithm are reported. The
   experimental setup includes a two-axis servo-system. Control and
   estimation algorithms are implemented on two sbRIO 9632 from National
   Instruments.}},

   studies on the power generation performance of bistable vibration energy

   estimate the vibration response decay and power generation of a bistable
   energy harvester when excited by an impulse. Enabling the prediction of
   time-varying snap-through dynamics, this new approach greatly extends
   the capabilities of the current averaging method when employed with the
   Jacobian elliptic functions. Comparison with values determined by the
   direct simulation of the governing equations shows that the analytically
   predicted average generated power is very accurate for a wide range of
   impulse strengths and load resistances. The analytical approach
   represents a great leap forward in the ever-expanding understanding of
   bistable vibration energy harvesters as implements to effectively
   capture and convert a wide range of excitation energies.}},

Abstract = {{Electrohydrodynamic jet (E-jet) printing is a recent technique for high
   resolution additive micromanufacturing. With high resolution comes
   sensitivity to small disturbances, which has kept this technique from
   reaching its industrial potential. Closed loop control of E-jet printing
   can overcome these disturbances, but it requires an improved
   understanding of ink droplet spreading on the substrate and a physical
   model to predict printed feature locations and geometries from process
   inputs and disturbances. This manuscript examines a model of ink droplet
   spreading that uses assumptions that are important to the e-jet process.
   Our model leverages previous energy balance models that were derived for
   larger length scale droplets. At the smaller length scale, we find that
   viscous losses are a significant portion of the energy budget and must
   be accounted for; this is in contrast to models at length scales two
   orders of magnitude larger. Our model predicts the droplet height, base
   radius and contact angle in time from an initial volume and E-jet
   printing control parameters. The model is validated with published
   droplet spreading data and new measurements of E-jet printed droplets of
   diameter 8 turn. The viscous friction calculated in the new model is
   found to be significant compared to surface energy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of optimally locating passive
   vibration isolators to minimize residual vibration caused by exogenous
   disturbance forces. The stiffness and damping properties of the
   isolators are assumed to be known and the task is to determine the
   isolator locations, which are nonlinearly related to system states. This
   paper proposes an approach for reformulating the nonlinear isolator
   placement problem as a LTI control problem by linking the control forces
   to measured outputs using a feedforward term. Accordingly, the isolator
   locations show up as a static output feedback gain matrix which is
   optimized for residual vibration reduction using standard Hco optimal
   control methods. Simulations and experiments on SISO and MIMO case
   studies are used to demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach.
   Even though presented in the specific context of ultra-precision
   manufacturing machines, the proposed method is applicable to the optimal
   design of other passive systems with nonlinear relationships between

Abstract = {{This article presents a model predictive control based obstacle
   avoidance algorithm for autonomous ground vehicles in unstructured
   environments. The novelty of the algorithm is the simultaneous
   optimization of speed and steering without a priori knowledge about the
   obstacles. Obstacles are detected using a planar light detection and
   ranging sensor and a multi-phase optimal control problem is formulated
   to optimize the speed and steering commands within the detection range.
   Acceleration capability of the vehicle as a function of speed, and
   stability and handling concerns such as tire lift-off are taken into
   account as constraints in the optimization problem, whereas the cost
   function is formulated to navigate the vehicle as quickly as possible
   with smooth control commands. Thus, a safe and quick navigation is
   enabled without the need for a preloaded map of the environment.
   Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of
   navigating the vehicle through obstacle fields that cannot be cleared

Abstract = {{The effects of ethanol on spray development and wall impingement of a
   direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engine was investigated using
   high-speed imaging of the fuel spray in an optically-accessible engine.
   Neat anhydrous ethanol (E100), reference grade gasoline (E0) and a 50\%
   blend (by volume) of gasoline and ethanol (E50) were used in the study.
   The experiments were conducted using continuous firing conditions for an
   intake manifold absolute pressure of 57 kPA, and engine speed of 1500
   RPM. Retarded fuel injection timing was used (with start of injection at
   250 degrees bTDC) to isolate the effects of cylinder wall impingement,
   and lean fuel to-air ratios (phi=0.8 - 0.9) were used to minimize
   sooting and coating of the transparent cylinder liner. The effects of
   three engine coolant temperatures (25, 60 and 90 degrees C) and two fuel
   rail pressures (100 and 150 bar) on the features of the spray and the
   spray interaction with the wall were studied for the different fuels.
   Quantitative metrics were defined to analyze the spatial features of the
   spray related to wall impingement. Gasoline (EO) sprays exhibited higher
   sensitivity to coolant temperature compared to ethanol (E100) in terms
   of the shape of the spray and wall impingement. Higher fuel injection
   pressure increased the spray tip penetration rate and fuel impingement
   with the wall for E0 and E100, despite creating wider plume angles of
   the fuel sprays.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving efficient and clean combustion of biodiesel as a renewable
   source of energy requires a fundamental understanding of the effects of
   the different thermophysical properties on the fuel injection process at
   conditions relevant to diesel engines. In this study, the spray
   characteristics of two fatty acid esters, methyl oleate and ethyl
   oleate, are compared to a baseline diesel fuel using high-speed imaging
   of the sprays in a constant volume chamber. A single hole fuel injector
   with a nozzle diameter of 280 pm was used with a single injection event
   with a duration of 1.0 ms. The spray development was investigated for
   fuel-rail pressures of 40, 60, 80 and 100 MPa and the chamber gas
   densities of 1.15 kg/m(3), 5.75 kg/m(3) and 11.5 kg/m(3). High-speed
   shadowgraph imaging of the non vaporizing sprays was performed at 15,000
   frames per second. Image processing algorithms were developed to
   quantify the spray penetration distance, penetration rate and cone angle
   as a function of time for the injection process. Penetration distance
   and penetration rate results were similar for the esters and diesel fuel
   for the range of experimental conditions studied. However, diesel had a
   larger spray cone angle compared to both esters. Additionally a novel
   metric for air entrainment was developed based on the macro-scale
   features of the spray. The integrated mixing volume metric showed no
   difference in air entrainment between the fuels, which is in good
   agreement with the behavior expected based on spray theory.}},

Abstract = {{The classification between a sequence of highly variable combustion
   events that have an underlying deterministic pattern and a sequence of
   combustion events with similar level of variability but random
   characteristics is important for control of combustion phasing. In the
   case of high cyclic variation (CV) with underlying deterministic
   patterns, it is possible to apply closed loop combustion control on a
   cyclic-basis with a fixed mean value, such as injection timing in
   homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) or spark timing in spark
   ignition (SI) applications, to contract the CV. In the case of a random
   distribution, the high CV can be avoided by shifting operating
   conditions away from the unstable region via advancing or retarding the
   injection timing or the spark timing in the mean-sense.
   Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the various methods of
   computing CA50 for analysing and classifying cycle-to-cycle variability.
   The assumptions made to establish fast and possibly on-line methods can
   alter the distribution of the calculated parameters from cycle-to-cycle,
   possibly leading to incorrect pattern interpretation and improper
   control action.
   Finally, we apply a statistical technique named ``permutation
   entropy{''} for the first time on classifying combustion patterns in
   HCCI and SI engine for varying operating condition. Then the various
   fast methods for computing CA50 feed the two statistical methods,
   permutation and the Shannon entropy, and their differences and
   similarities are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, assembly and characterization of a fully
   automated portable gas chromatography system coupled with a
   purge-and-trap system for the sensitive and rapid field analysis of
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in water samples. The VOCs were
   firstly purged by helium gas in the micro-fabricated
   preconcentrator/injector and then injected into the downstream capillary
   column and photoionization detector for separation and detection. The
   purge-and-trap conditions were optimized to efficiently extract VOCs
   from water samples. The calibration of 6 VOCs with concentrations
   ranging from 1 mu g L-1 to 500 mg L-1 showed excellent linearity (R-2 >
   0.99). Detection limits (3 sigma) of sub-mu g L-1 (or
   sub-parts-per-billion level) were achieved, which are orders of
   magnitude lower than the maximum contaminant level (MCL) established by
   the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The separation of 26
   analytes (in a vapor pressure range from 0.087 Torr to 180 Torr) in a
   water sample in less than 15 minutes was also demonstrated. Finally, the
   optimized system was applied to field analysis of a groundwater sample
   in an environmental remediation site. The quantified results agreed well
   with those obtained by an analytical lab using standard analytical
   methods and instruments. Our system offers a lab-on-a-chip solution for
   sensitive and rapid water analysis compliant with the EPA sample
   collection method. It will have a wide range of applications in
   environmental monitoring, industries and healthcare.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of surface orientation and doping on
   the dissolution of Mn ions from LiMn2O4 structures using first

   dissolution. By comparing the electronic properties and structures of
   systems with different surfaces and dopings, Mn dissolution mechanisms
   and their prevention can be better understood. Based on our
   calculations, Mn dissolution is strongly correlated with the electronic
   and bonding properties of the Mn-O bonds. Surface orientations with a
   larger number of Mn-O bonds and smaller bond length require more energy
   to break the Mn-O bonds. In addition, doping with certain elements
   changes the bonding state of Mn, which either prevents or aggravates Mn
   dissolution. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to properties of flexible material, uneven thickness, cutting speed,

   flexible material, the edge of processing path image become fuzzy,
   causing difficulty of improving edge detection precision. In this paper,
   after analyzing characteristics path contour of flexible material,
   taking gray-level integration of target area as a regional energy, and
   adding it to traditional Snake model which is widely used in edge
   extracting of complex geometric shapes, combining image edge with region
   information to build a new Region Snake (R-S) model, therefore by
   certain transformation, the description of total energy of contour can
   be replaced by force acting that moving on the contour. In new R-S
   model, matrix expression of discrete force balance equation of contour
   is obtained by discretization of finite difference method, then
   derivative terms are introduced and to get the calculation formula of
   processing path contour curve through Euler iteration method; finally by
   judging local extremum of covariance matrix of curve to realize corner
   detection. Three patterns with different shape characteristics were used
   to test the R-S model, Experimental results show that, the target
   contour curves of three patterns are completely extracted, the mean
   square errors of extracted curves are less than 0.35\%, the detection
   rates of corners are greater than 90\%, these prove that the R-S model
   proposed for flexible materials processing path contour extraction has
   high calculation accuracy and good stability, the method of corner
   detection is very suitable for flexible material processing path

Abstract = {{The ducal imaging with photoacoustic imaging (PAI) that is an emerging
   technology and clinical ultrasound imaging that is an established
   modality is developed for the imaging of early inflammatory arthritis.
   PAI is sensitive to blood volume, not limited by flow like ultrasound,
   holding great promise for the earliest detection of increase in blood
   volume and angiogenesis - a key early finding inflammation PAI has the
   capability of assessing inflammation in superficial human soft tissues,
   offering potential benefits in diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of
   inflammatory arthritis. PAI combined with ultrasonography (US), is a
   real time dual-modality system developed and tested to identify active
   synovitis in metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of 10 arthritis patients
   and 10 normal volunteers. Photoacoustic images of the joints were
   acquired at 580-nm laser wavelength, which provided the desired balance
   between the optical contrast of hemoglobin over bone cortex and the
   imaging depth. Confirmed by US Doppler imaging, the results from ten
   patients and ten normal volunteers demonstrated satisfactory sensitivity
   of PAI in assessing enhanced blood flow due to active synovitis. This
   preliminary study suggests that photoacoustic imaging, by identifying
   early increase in blood volume, related to increased vascularity, a
   hallmark of joint inflammation, could be a valuable supplement to
   musculoskeletal US.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a gain scheduling strategy that can be used in
   conjunction with explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC). Traditionally,
   explicit MPC is not reconfigurable to online model changes. To handle
   off-nominal plant conditions, a common practice is to design multiple
   explicit MPC's which are each valid locally around their respective
   operating points. This inevitably requires large amounts of memory to
   store the explicit MPC's and implementation of switching logic and
   observers. The gain scheduling strategy presented in this paper bypasses
   the need to store multiple explicit MPC's. This is done by multiplying
   the control signal obtained from the nominal explicit MPC by a gain
   scheduling matrix such that the plant at off-nominal operating
   conditions is approximately matched to the nominal plant. This is
   further accomplished in a manner such that the original control
   constraints are satisfied. The gain scheduling strategy is demonstrated
   in simulations on a nonlinear diesel air path model over the New
   European Drive Cycle (NEDC).}},

Abstract = {{Error propagation and accumulation is a common problem for system level
   engine modeling at which individually modeled components are connected
   to form a complete engine model. Engines with exhaust gas recirculation
   (EGR) and turbocharging have components connected in a feedback
   configuration (the exhaust conditions affect the intake and the intake,
   consequently, affects the exhaust), thus they have a challenging model
   tuning process. This paper presents a systematic procedure for effective
   tuning of an engine air-charge path model to improve accuracy at the
   system level as well as reducing the computational complexity of tuning
   a large set of components. Based on using sensitivity analysis, the
   presented procedure is used to inspect which component influences more a
   set of selected outputs in a model with high degree of freedom caused by
   many parameters of different components. After selecting the influential
   component, which is the turbocharger in this study, further tuning is
   applied to parameters in the component to increase the overall accuracy
   of the complete engine model. The corrections applied to the air charge
   path model of a 6 cylinder 13L heavy duty diesel engine with EGR and
   twin-scroll turbocharger was shown to effectively improve the model
   accuracy.}},

   of fixed frequency. The frequency of all sinusoidal torques is equal,

   the inverse-dynamics problem of determining the amplitudes and phases

Abstract = {{It is important to rigorously and comprehensively evaluate the safety of
   Automated Vehicles (AVs) before their production and deployment. A
   popular AV evaluation approach is Naturalistic-Field Operational Test
   (N-FOT) which tests prototype vehicles directly on public roads. Due to
   the low exposure to safety-critical scenarios, N-FOTs is time-consuming
   and expensive to conduct. Computer simulations can be used as an
   alternative to N-FOTs, especially in terms of generating motions of the
   surrounding traffic. In this paper, we propose an accelerated evaluation
   approach for AVs. Human-controlled vehicles (HVs) were modeled as
   disturbance to AVs based on data extracted from the Safety Pilot Model
   Deployment Program. The cut-in scenarios are generated based on skewed
   statistics of collected human driver behavior, which amplifies riskier
   testing scenarios while reserves its statistical information so that the
   safety benefits of AV in non-accelerated cases can be accurately
   estimated. An AV model based on a production vehicle was tested. Results
   show that the proposed method can accelerate the evaluation process by
   at least 100 times.}},

Title = {{Aptasensor for the simple detection of ochratoxin A based on
   side-by-side assembly of gold nanorods}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{A new optical aptasensor is described based on the side-by-side assembly
   of gold nanorods (GNRs) for the one-step determination of ochratoxin A
   (OTA), which is a mycotoxin identified as a contaminant in grains and
   wine throughout the world. A DNA aptamer against OTA exhibiting high
   affinity and binding specificity has already been used as a
   biorecognition element to improve detection. Here, thiol-modified DNA
   was decorated on the side sites of GNRs acting as probes. A linker DNA
   containing aptamer sequences against OTA hybridized with the DNA
   decorated on the GNRs. It was shown that the GNRs assembled side-by-side
   through DNA hybridization in the absence of OTA, exhibiting strongly
   enhanced optical properties. However, in the presence of OTA, the GNRs
   dispersed as a result of specific aptamer-OTA recognition and
   conformational changes in the aptamer. The resulting changes in the
   absorption spectra of the GNRs were used for sensing. A linear
   correlation was demonstrated between the absorbance of the GNRs at 708
   nm and the concentration of OTA over the range 0.5-20 ng mL(-1). The
   limit of detection was 0.22 ng mL(-1) (3 sigma), which meets the demand
   for detection of the allowed concentrations of OTA in foods according to
   European Commission Regulations (2 ng g(-1)). The selectivity and
   feasibility of the developed OTA aptasensor for the detection of OTA in
   red wine samples was also evaluated and it was shown to be a simple,
   efficient and cost-effective one-step detection method. This method is a
   promising tool in toxin screening to guarantee food safety and to
   minimize potential risks to human health.}},

Title = {{Framework for selecting occupancy-focused energy interventions in
   buildings}},
Journal = {{BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{5-6, SI}},
Pages = {{535-551}},
Abstract = {{Energy policy tools aimed at achieving energy savings for buildings have
   often yielded less than the predicted savings. One reason for these
   results is that the design of these tools often neglects the actions and
   behaviours of the building occupants, and focuses more on the cost and
   ease of implementation. This research highlights the importance of
   identifying the diverse characteristics of occupants that significantly
   contribute to environmental problems, and the factors that make
   sustainable behavioural patterns attractive. A multilevel intervention
   strategy tailored to various occupants' characteristics to produce and
   maintain large-scale energy savings for buildings over time is proposed.
   To achieve this, the framework adopts a motivation/opportunity/ability
   (MOA) approach from the consumer and social marketing fields, where
   intervention strategies can be regarded as advertisements enticing the
   building occupants to adopt certain energy-use characteristics. The
   conceptual framework involves: measuring occupants' pre- and
   post-intervention exposure MOA level and energy-use profiles; clustering
   occupants based on identified characteristics; and accordingly choose
   energy-efficiency intervention strategies. The results of a case study
   of an actual building highlight the capabilities of the proposed
   framework in the selection of effective intervention strategies to
   achieve the required energy reductions.}},

Title = {{Ultrasound Shear Wave Simulation of Breast Tumor Using Nonlinear Tissue
   Elasticity}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) can assess the elasticity of
   tissues, but the shear modulus estimated in SWEI is often less sensitive
   to a subtle change of the stiffness that produces only small mechanical
   contrast to the background tissues. Because most soft tissues exhibit
   mechanical nonlinearity that differs in tissue types, mechanical
   contrast can be enhanced if the tissues are compressed. In this study, a
   finite element- (FE-) based simulation was performed for a breast tissue
   model, which consists of a circular (D: 10 mm, hard) tumor and
   surrounding tissue (soft). The SWEI was performed with 0\% to 30\%
   compression of the breast tissue model. The shear modulus of the tumor
   exhibited noticeably high nonlinearity compared to soft background
   tissue above 10\% overall applied compression. As a result, the elastic
   modulus contrast of the tumor to the surrounding tissue was increased
   from 0.46 at 0\% compression to 1.45 at 30\% compression.}},

Title = {{A moist aquaplanet variant of the Held-Suarez test for atmospheric model
   dynamical cores}},
Journal = {{GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1263-1292}},
Abstract = {{A moist idealized test case (MITC) for atmospheric model dynamical cores
   is presented. The MITC is based on the Held-Suarez (HS) test that was
   developed for dry simulations on ``a flat Earth{''} and replaces the
   full physical parameterization package with a Newtonian temperature
   relaxation and Rayleigh damping of the low-level winds. This new variant
   of the HS test includes moisture and thereby sheds light on the
   nonlinear dynamics-physics moisture feedbacks without the complexity of
   full-physics parameterization packages. In particular, it adds
   simplified moist processes to the HS forcing to model large-scale
   condensation, boundary-layer mixing, and the exchange of latent and
   sensible heat between the atmospheric surface and an ocean-covered
   planet. Using a variety of dynamical cores of the National Center for
   Atmospheric Research (NCAR)'s Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), this
   paper demonstrates that the inclusion of the moist idealized physics
   package leads to climatic states that closely resemble aquaplanet
   simulations with complex physical parameterizations. This establishes
   that the MITC approach generates reasonable atmospheric circulations and
   can be used for a broad range of scientific investigations. This paper
   provides examples of two application areas. First, the test case reveals
   the characteristics of the physics-dynamics coupling technique and
   reproduces coupling issues seen in full-physics simulations. In
   particular, it is shown that sudden adjustments of the prognostic fields
   due to moist physics tendencies can trigger undesirable large-scale
   gravity waves, which can be remedied by a more gradual application of
   the physical forcing. Second, the moist idealized test case can be used
   to intercompare dynamical cores. These examples demonstrate the
   versatility of the MITC approach and suggestions are made for further
   application areas. The new moist variant of the HS test can be
   considered a test case of intermediate complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Hough functions are the eigenfunctions of the Laplace tidal equation
   governing fluid motion on a rotating sphere with a resting basic state.
   Several numerical methods have been used in the past. In this paper, we
   compare two of those methods: normalized associated Legendre polynomial
   expansion and Chebyshev collocation. Both methods are not widely used,
   but both have some advantages over the commonly used unnormalized
   associated Legendre polynomial expansion method. Comparable results are
   obtained using both methods. For the first method we note some details
   on numerical implementation. The Chebyshev collocation method was first
   used for the Laplace tidal problem by Boyd (1976) and is relatively easy
   to use. A compact MATLAB code is provided for this method. We also
   illustrate the importance and effect of including a parity factor in
   Chebyshev polynomial expansions for modes with odd zonal wave numbers.}},

Title = {{Development of a Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface for Control of
   a Neuroprosthetic Limb}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Background. The purpose of this experiment was to develop a peripheral
   nerve interface using cultured myoblasts within a scaffold to provide a
   biologically stable interface while providing signal amplification for
   neuroprosthetic control and preventing neuroma formation. Methods. A
   Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface (RPNI) composed of a scaffold
   and cultured myoblasts was implanted on the end of a divided peroneal
   nerve in rats (n = 25). The scaffold material consisted of either
   silicone mesh, acellular muscle, or acellular muscle with chemically
   polymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) conductive polymer. Average
   implantation time was 93 days. Electrophysiological tests were performed
   at endpoint to determine RPNI viability and ability to transduce neural
   signals. Tissue samples were examined using both light microscopy and
   immunohistochemistry. Results. All implanted RPNIs, regardless of
   scaffold type, remained viable and displayed robust vascularity.
   Electromyographic activity and stimulated compound muscle action
   potentials were successfully recorded from all RPNIs. Physiologic
   efferent motor action potentials were detected from RPNIs in response to
   sensory foot stimulation. Histology and transmission electron microscopy
   revealed mature muscle fibers, axonal regeneration without neuroma
   formation, neovascularization, and synaptogenesis. Desmin staining
   confirmed the preservation and maturation of myoblasts within the RPNIs.
   Conclusions. RPNI demonstrates significant myoblast maturation,
   innervation, and vascularization without neuroma formation.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is the primary numerical
   technique for analysis of rarefied gas flows. While recent progress in
   computational chemistry is beginning to provide vibrationally resolved
   transition and reaction cross sections that can be employed in DSMC
   calculations, the particle nature of the standard DSMC method makes it
   difficult to use this information in a statistically significant way.
   The current study introduces a new technique that makes it possible to
   resolve all of the vibrational energy levels by using a master equation
   approach along with temperature-dependent transition rates. The new
   method is compared to the standard DSMC technique for several heat bath
   and shock wave conditions and demonstrates the ability to resolve the
   full vibrational manifold at the expected overall rates of relaxation.
   The ability of the new master equation approach to the DSMC method for

Title = {{Effects of translation-rotation coupling on the displacement probability
   distribution functions of boomerang colloidal particles}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{4318-4323}},
Abstract = {{Prior studies have shown that low symmetry particles such as
   micro-boomerangs exhibit behaviour of Brownian motion rather different
   from that of high symmetry particles because convenient tracking points
   (TPs) are usually inconsistent with their center of hydrodynamic stress
   (CoH) where the translational and rotational motions are decoupled. In
   this paper we study the effects of the translation-rotation coupling on
   the displacement probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the
   boomerang colloid particles with symmetric arm length. By tracking the
   motions of different points on the particle symmetry axis, we show that
   as the distance between the TP and the CoH is increased, the effects of
   translation-rotation coupling becomes pronounced, making the short-time
   2D PDF for fixed initial orientation to change from elliptical, to bean
   and then to crescent shape, and the angle averaged PDFs change from
   ellipsoidal-particle-like PDF to a shape with a Gaussian top and long
   displacement tails. We also observed that at long times the PDFs revert
   to Gaussian. These 2D PDF shapes provide a clear physical picture of the
   non-zero mean displacements observed in boomerangs particles.}},

Title = {{Circular extinction of plasmonic silver nanocaps and gas sensing}},
Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{186}},
Pages = {{345-352}},
Abstract = {{Chiral plasmonic nanostructures exhibit strong rotatory optical activity
   and are expected to enrich the field of metaoptical materials. Potential
   applications of chiroplasmonic nanostructures include circular
   polarizers, optical polarization detectors, asymmetric catalysts, and
   sensors. However, chiral plasmonic materials require subwavelength
   structural control and involve laborious chemical or lithographic
   procedures for their manufacturing. Moreover, strong rotatory activity
   of subwavelength structures whose chirality was imparted by
   microfabrication, has been obtained for the red and infrared parts of
   the spectrum but faces new challenges for the blue and violet spectral
   ranges even with plasmonic materials with plasmonic bands in the 200-400
   nm window. In this study, we address this problem by preparing chiral
   subwavelength nanostructures by glancing angle sputtering of metallic
   silver on ZnO nanopillar arrays. Silver deposition in two different
   planes is a convenient method for preparation of silver chiroplasmonic
   nanocaps (Ag CPNCs) with controlled asymmetry. Circular dichroism
   spectroscopy was used to examine the circular extinction for the
   left-handed nanocaps (L-CPNCs) with understanding that not only circular
   dichroism but also many other optical effects contribute to the
   amplitude of these bands. The pillared silver films exhibit circular
   extinction in the violet area of the electromagnetic spectrum. Partial
   oxidation of Ag to AgxO causes the absorption and corresponding circular
   extinction band obtained using a conventional CD spectrometer at 400-525
   nm to increase and shift. This optical material may be used to detect
   oxygen and extends the spectrum of application of chiroplasmonic
   materials to gas sensing.}},

Title = {{Simulating water flow in variably saturated soils: a comparison of a 3D
   model with approximation-based formulations}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{274-290}},
Abstract = {{In hydrological models, variably saturated flow is often described using
   the Richards equation, either in a fully three-dimensional (3D)
   implementation or using a quasi-3D framework based on the 1D Richards
   equation for vertical flow and a flow-approximation for the other two
   dimensions. However, it is unclear in which configuration or under which
   boundary conditions these approximations can produce adequate estimates.
   In this study, two formulations with a quasi-3D approach are benchmarked
   against a fully 3D model (HYDRUS-3D). The formulations are: the
   Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator + VEGetation Generator for
   Interactive Evolution (tRIBS + VEGGIE) model that uses the Dupuit
   Forchheimer assumption and the Tethys \& Chloris (T\&C) model that
   implements the kinematic approach. Effects of domain slope, hillslope
   size, event size and initial moisture conditions on simulated runoff and
   soil moisture dynamics are examined in event-based simulations at the
   hillslope scale. The Dupuit Forchheimer assumption (tRIBS-VEGGIE)
   produces deviations from the HYDRUS-3D solutions only for simulations
   with initially dry soil. Using the kinematic approach (T\&C) results in
   deviations from the 3D solution primarily for the small hillslope domain
   in combination with a gentle slope angle. This applies especially to the
   partition between subsurface and surface runoff production, with T\&C
   being biased towards the latter. For all other cases investigated, the
   simpler formulations provide reasonable approximations of the 3D model.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to develop an optimal planning framework
   for a production system utilizing multisource distributed energy
   supplies, in order to improve its energy efficiency and to reduce the
   dependency on grid energy and outage risk. The energy consumption of an
   automotive seat assembly plant is modeled using a discrete-event
   simulation, which consumes energy supplied by wind and solar, as well as
   traditional power grids. Machines can be halted for designed time period
   to avoid high peak load and operate efficiently in terms of power
   consumption. On the other hand, the inventory level can be planned by
   adjusting production goal to better utilize alternative energy and
   accommodate demand uncertainty using stochastic programming method. The
   results from case studies show that optimizing waiting time for each
   process can effectively reduce outage risk while meeting customer
   demands. Having the optimal production goal to over-produce when
   alternative energy supply is high can reduce the dependency on grid
   energy. Also, the benefit of considering predicted future customer
   demands would have the effect of safety inventory, which can prevent
   shortages during extremely high customer demand periods.}},

Title = {{Rich Janus colloid phase behavior under steady shear}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{4071-4081}},
Abstract = {{We study the assembly of single-patch colloidal Janus particles under
   steady shear flow via Brownian dynamics simulations. In the absence of
   flow, by varying the Janus patch size and the range and strength of the
   anisotropic interaction potential, Janus colloids form different
   aggregates such as micelles, wormlike clusters, vesicles and lamellae.
   Under shear flow we observe rearrangement, deformation, and break-up of
   aggregates. At small and intermediate Peclet (Pe) numbers-the ratio
   between shear and Brownian forces-the competition between rearrangement,
   deformation, and break-up favors the growth of micelles and vesicles
   increasing mean cluster size, which is consistent with a previous
   numerical study of Janus particles under shear. This initial
   shear-induced growth causes micelles and vesicles to reach a maximum
   cluster size at Pe approximate to 1 and Pe approximate to 10,
   respectively. After this growth micelles dissociate continuously to
   reach a dilute colloidal ``gas phase'' at Pe approximate to 10 while
   vesicles dissociate into micelles with high aspect ratio at Pe
   approximate to 10 and finally break-up into a gas phase at Pe
   approximate to 30. Wormlike clusters initially break-up into micelles
   with high aspect ratio at Pe approximate to 0.1, and proceed to finally
   reach a gas phase at Pe approximate to 10. Lamellae initially break into
   smaller lamellae that align with the flow in the
   velocity-velocity-gradient plane and finally break-up into a gas phase
   at Pe approximate to 100. The different cluster sizes and morphologies
   observed as functions of interaction range, Janus patch size,
   interaction strength, and shear rate, open new actuation routes for
   reconfigurable materials and applications.}},

Title = {{Multiobjective Optimization of Turning Cutting Parameters for J-Steel
   Material}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a multiobjective optimization study of cutting
   parameters in turning operation for a heat-treated alloy steel material
   (J-Steel) with Vickers hardness in the range of HV 365-395 using
   uncoated, unlubricated Tungsten-Carbide tools. The primary aim is to
   identify proper settings of the cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed
   rate, and depth of cut) that lead to reasonable compromises between good
   surface quality and high material removal rate. Thorough exploration of
   the range of cutting parameters was conducted via a five-level
   full-factorial experimental matrix of samples and the Pareto trade-off
   frontier is identified. The trade off among the objectives was observed
   to have a ``knee{''} shape, in which certain settings for the cutting
   parameters can achieve both good surface quality and high material
   removal rate within certain limits. However, improving one of the
   objectives beyond these limits can only happen at the expense of a large
   compromise in the other objective. An alternative approach for
   identifying the trade-off frontier was also tested via multiobjective
   implementation of the Efficient Global Optimization (m-EGO) algorithm.
   The m-EGO algorithm was successful in identifying two points within the
   good range of the trade-off frontier with 36\% fewer experimental
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{In the environment, the process of combustion is the dominant pathway
   through which mankind continuously injects particles into the atmosphere
   at the present time. The most direct and serious risk related to these
   emissions is the direct absorption of these particles into the living
   systems of humans and animals through the process of respiration,
   especially in more urban environments. Little is known about the
   potential of low-level exposures to alter key biophysical functions,
   such as membrane form and function. This study employs molecular
   dynamics simulations to reconstruct the free energy landscapes of the
   mechanisms of entry of nanoparticles into biological cells.
   Specifically, we investigate the behavior of two nanoparticles produced
   in combustion conditions with different amphiphilic properties to assess
   the effect of chemical composition on the interactions with cellular
   membranes. Free energy calculations of nanoparticles interacting with a
   lipid bilayer composed of dimyristoylphosphatidyl-choline and
   cholesterol show that the presence of hydroxyl groups on the
   nanoparticle makes the region where the lipids' heads are solvated by
   water the most favorable position for these species. The hydrophobic
   nanoparticle shows a strong affinity for the center of the membrane.
   This study shows the importance of surface composition and suggests
   different mechanisms of interactions of nanoparticles with cellular
   membranes.}},

Abstract = {{To utilize human heat energy as a permanent power source, we
   demonstrate, for the first time, an intrinsically highly foldable and
   stretchable thermoelectric generator that is based upon chemically
   exfoliated 1T-transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanosheets (NSs)
   for self-powered wearable electronics. The power factors of WS2 (n-type)
   and NbSe2 (p-type) NS films were evaluated to be 5-7 mu K-2 m(-1) and
   26-34 mu W K-2 m(-1), respectively, near room temperature. With these
   films, parallel-connected thermoelectric generators that were fabricated
   were able to constantly produce up to 38 nW of output power at D60 K.
   The thermoelectric device stably sustained its performance, even after
   100 bending cycles and after 100 stretching cycles (50\% strain). By
   direct observation, we found that the film is highly stretched by
   partial tearing and folding but still maintains an electrical
   percolation pathway. The morphology then is quickly recovered by a
   plug-in contact between the torn parts as the external strain is
   released. Finally, we demonstrate the electric power generation from a
   prototype wearable thermoelectric generator that was woven into a
   wristband fitted on a real human body.}},

Title = {{The thermodynamic stability of intermediate solid solutions in LiFePO4
   nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{5436-5447}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical predictions from first principles and recent advances in in
   situ electrochemical characterization techniques have confirmed the
   presence of solid-solution states during electrochemical (de) lithiation
   of LiFePO4 nanoparticles. Surprisingly, however, such thermodynamically
   unfavorable solid solution states have been observed at rates as low as
   0.1C. Given the high diffusivity of Li in LiFePO4 and the thermodynamic
   instability of homogeneous solid solution states, spinodal decomposition
   to a thermodynamically favorable two-phase state is expected to occur on
   time scales as rapid as 1-100 ms. In this paper, we resolve this
   apparent paradox by demonstrating that, given the symmetry of the
   low-energy solid-solution Li/Va orderings and the 1D character of Li
   diffusion, spinodal decomposition from a solid solution preferentially
   leads to the formation of a diffuse ac interface with a large
   intermediate solid-solution region, as opposed to the commonly assumed
   bc interface. Our first principles predictions not only rationalize the
   persistence of solid-solution states at low-to-moderate C-rates in
   high-rate LiFePO4 electrodes, but also explain the observations of large
   intermediate solid-solution regions at an ac interface in single
   LixFePO4 particles quenched from a high-temperature solid solution.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{41410-41419}},
Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive simulation study of the effect of composition
   on the structural, elastic and thermal properties of 25 different
   compounds from the pyrochlore family. We joined a repulsive potential to
   an existing interatomic potential to enable molecular dynamics
   simulations of conditions away from equilibrium. We systematically
   varied the chemistry of the pyrochlore by substituting different cations
   in the A and B sites of the A(2)B(2)O(7) formula unit. The A cations
   varied from Lu3+ to La3+, and the B cations from Ti4+ to Ce4+. The
   lattice parameter increased steadily with increasing the radius of A or
   B cations, but the bulk modulus showed a decreasing trend with
   increasing cation radius. However, the specific heat capacity and
   thermal expansion coefficient remained almost unchanged with increasing
   the radii of A and B cations. It is of interest to note that Ce on the B
   site significantly reduces the specific heat capacity and thermal
   expansion coefficient, which could have implications for annealing of
   radiation damage in cerate pyrochlores. The present results are
   consistent with the experimental measurements, which suggests that these
   potentials are appropriate for studying the problem of interest, namely
   simulation of dynamical processes, radiation damage, and defect
   migration in pyrochlores.}},

Abstract = {{Cochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices that restore hearing
   in deaf patients. They consist of a linear electrode array surgically
   inserted into the scala tympani of the cochlea. In this position the
   array directly stimulates the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), bypassing
   lost or nonfunctioning sensory hair cells. In order to reduce the energy
   needed to stimulate the SGNs, we attempted to improve the conductivity
   of the CI electrodes by creating conductive nanocomposites. We assessed
   the functional modification of CI platinum (Pt) pads by using
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) either alone or in combination
   with a conductive polythiophene phase, to obtain conductive
   nanocomposites (NCs). A novel functional poly(EDOT3:EDOT-COOH1)
   copolymer was synthesized by liquid-phase oxidative polymerization (LPP)
   of both 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and carboxylated EDOT
   (EDOT-COOH) monomers. Molar ratios of monomers EDOT3:EDOT-COOH1 were
   obtained and a poly(EDOT3:EDOT-COOH1) polymeric phase was further
   incorporated with oxidized MWCNTs (ox-MWCNTs) to obtain a homogeneous
   conductive NC phase. Immobilization of single components or NC onto Pt
   electrodes using cysteamine-based covalent modification has been
   achieved and characterized. Impedance spectroscopy of Pt-modified
   electrodes showed a reduced resistance at different frequencies for the
   specific NC consisting of poly(EDOT3:EDOT-COOH1)/SH/ox-MWCNTs/SH (1 : 1
   wt\%). Finally, we revealed the functional outcome of these
   nanostructured chemical modifications concerning the stimulation of SGN
   in vitro using multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). We aimed at reducing the
   energy needed to stimulate the SGNs and obtain an effective neuronal
   response. This has been observed for Pt electrodes modified with NC.}},

   diblock copolymer with star-shaped polystyrene (SPS) molecules of
   varying functionalities f, where 4 <= f <= 64, and molecular weights per
   arm M-arm. The miscibility of the system and the surface composition
   varied appreciably with M-arm and f. For large values of M-arm,
   regardless of f, the miscibility of the system was qualitatively similar
   to that of linear chain PS/PS-b-P2VP mixtures - the copolymer chains
   aggregate to form micelles, each composed of an inner P2VP core and PS
   corona, which preferentially segregate to the free surface. On the other
   hand, for large f and small M-arm, SPS molecules preferentially resided
   at the free surface. Moreover, blends containing SPS molecules with the
   highest values of f and lowest values of M-arm were phase separated.
   These observations are rationalized in terms of competing entropic
   interactions and the dependence of the surface tension of the
   star-shaped molecules on M-arm and f.}},

Abstract = {{Size and phase-controlled growth and assembly of semiconductor
   nanostructures from ultrasmall building blocks are of great significance
   in aspects of both science and engineering. In this work, ZnS
   nanostructures including nanoparticles, nanobelts, single-crystal
   nanowires and layered ZnS(EN)(0.5) hybrid structures are flexibly
   synthesized in a one-pot solvothermal system using ethylenediamine (EN)
   as the sole coordination agent. Comprehensive structure
   characterization, especially including spherical aberration corrected
   STEM imaging under an ultralow current density (2.55 A cm(-2)), provides
   direct evidence that the role of EN molecules varies from being surface
   stabilizers to being internal bridging blocks with changing introduction
   procedures. When introduced after the formation of ZnS precursors, EN
   passivates the non-polarized facets of ZnS clusters and activates the
   anisotropic growth along the {[}001] axis of the ZnS clusters into 1D
   wurtzite nanowires. When it is added before the formation of the ZnS
   clusters, EN molecules serve as the bridging blocks yielding layered
   ZnS(EN)(0.5) hybrid structures through the connection of wurtzite ZnS
   (110) slabs. The layered ZnS(EN)(0.5) nanostructures turn into
   single-crystal nanobelts after the removal of the EN components.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{7755-7760}},
Abstract = {{Substantial effort has been dedicated to understand the intrinsic
   electronic properties of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). However, electron
   transport study on monolayer MoS2 has been challenging to date,
   especially at low temperatures due to large metal/semiconductor junction
   barriers. Herein, we report the fabrication and characterization of the
   monolayer MoS2 single-electron transistor. High performance devices are
   obtained through the use of low work function metal (zinc) contact and a
   rapid thermal annealing step. Coulomb blockade is observed at low
   temperatures and is attributed to single-electron tunneling via two
   tunnel junction barriers. The nature of Coulomb blockade is also
   investigated by temperature-dependent conductance oscillation
   measurement. Our results hold promise for the study of novel quantum
   transport phenomena in 2D semiconducting atomic layer crystals.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofibrous electroactive composite scaffolds with sustained release
   properties based on polylactide (PLA) nanofibers and electroactive
   nanoparticles from polyurethane-urea copolymers were fabricated for
   tissue engineering applications. Electroactive polyurethane-urea
   copolymers were fabricated into nanoparticles which possessed sustained
   release kinetics for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. Composite
   scaffolds were obtained using an electrospray/electrospinning procedure
   with electroactive polyurethane-urea nanoparticles universally coated on
   PLA nanofibers. The morphology of nanoparticles, PLA fibers, and
   composite scaffolds was observed by SEM. The drug release profile of
   composite scaffolds was studied using ibuprofen and rutin as model
   drugs. The mechanism of the sustained release of the drugs was
   investigated. Rutin loaded composite material was used as an active
   scaffold for L929 fibroblast proliferation. Both random and aligned
   structures of electroactive composite PLA nanofibrous scaffolds were
   fabricated. The effect of surface chemistry and topographical cues on
   C2C12 cell proliferation and differentiation was studied on composite
   scaffolds, and it was found that electroactivity and aligned morphology
   of the composite nanofibers provide a synergetic effect for C2C12

Journal = {{AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{21-44}},
Abstract = {{Pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, and wastewater
   products are emerging environmental concerns for manifold reasons,
   including the potential of some compounds found in these products for
   endocrine disruption at a very low chronic exposure level. The
   environmental occurrences and sources of these contaminants in the
   water, soil, sediment and biota in European nations and the United
   States are well documented. This work reports a screening-level emission
   and fate assessment of thirty compounds, listed in the National
   Reconnaissance of the United States Geological Survey (USGS, 1999-2000)
   as the most frequently detected organic wastewater contaminants in U.S.
   streams and rivers. Estimations of the surface water fate factors were
   based on Level II and Level III multimedia fugacity models for a 1000
   km(2) model environment, the size of a typical county in the eastern
   United States. The compounds are categorized into three groups based
   upon the sensitivity of their predicted surface water fate factors to
   uncertainties in their physicochemical property values and the landscape
   parameters. The environmental fate factors, mass distributions, and loss
   pathways of all of the compounds are strongly affected by their assumed
   modes of entry into the environment. It is observed that for thirteen of
   the thirty organic wastewater contaminants most commonly detected in
   surface waters, conventional treatment strategies may be ineffective for
   their removal from wastewater effluents. The surface water fate factors
   predicted by the fugacity models were used in conjunction with the
   surface water concentrations measured in the USGS reconnaissance to
   obtain emission flux estimates for the compounds into U.S. streams and
   rivers. These include estimated fluxes of 6.8 x 10(-5) to 0.30 kg/h
   km(2) for the biomarker coprostanol; 1.7 x 10(-5) to 6.5 x 10(-5) kg/h
   km(2) for the insect repellent N, N-diethyltoluamide; and 4.3 x 10(-6)
   to 3.1 x 10(-5) kg/h km(2) for the steroid estriol.}},

Abstract = {{There is now a considerable body of evidence that many cancers are
   hierarchically organized and driven by a cellular component termed
   ``cancer stem cells{''} (CSCs). These cells have the ability to
   self-renew and to generate heterogeneous populations that constitute the
   tumor bulk. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that CSCs mediate
   tumor metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
   CSC biomarkers have been identified and both in vitro and mouse models
   have been developed to facilitate the isolation of these cells as well
   as the elucidation of CSC regulatory pathways. Agents targeting CSCs
   have now entered early phase clinical trials. The development of these
   clinical trials highlights the important need to develop technologies to
   monitor CSCs in patients. Unlike hematologic malignancies, where tumor
   specimens are readily obtainable, in solid tumors obtaining serial
   biopsies to assess CSCs is difficult. Studies suggest that circulating
   tumor cells (CTCs) contain a highly enriched proportion of CSCs and thus
   monitoring these cells in blood may provide a liquid biopsy for CSC
   assessment in solid tumors. In parallel with developments of efficient
   CTC isolation technologies, assays to molecularly characterize these
   cells at single cell resolution are also being developed. In this
   chapter we will review the current status of CSC therapeutic
   technologies as well as microfluidic techniques for isolation and
   molecular characterization of CTCs in cancer patients. If CSCs are
   responsible for tumor metastasis, resistance, and recurrence,
   development of effective CSC therapies has the potential to
   significantly improve the efficacy of cancer treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Wing shape is one of the main drivers of aircraft aerodynamic
   performance, so most aerodynamic shape optimization efforts have focused
   solely on the wing. However, the performance of the full aircraft
   configuration must account for the fact that the aircraft needs to be
   trimmed. Thus, to realize the full benefit of aerodynamic shape
   optimization, one should optimize the wing shape while including the
   full configuration and a trim constraint. To evaluate the benefit of
   this approach, we perform the aerodynamic shape optimization of the
   Common Research Model wing-body-tail configuration using gradient-based
   optimization with a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model that includes
   a discrete adjoint implementation. We investigate the aerodynamic shape
   optimization of the wing with a trim constraint that is satisfied by
   rotating the horizontal tail. We then optimize the same wing-body
   configuration without the tail but with an added trim drag penalty based
   on a surrogate model we created before the optimization. The drag
   coefficient is minimized subject to lift and trim constraints. We found
   that considering the trim during optimization is a better approach than
   using a fixed-wing moment constraint. We also show that the trim drag
   surrogate model we created yields a minimum drag coefficient that is
   within 1.2 counts of the minimum drag coefficient obtained by rotating
   the tail to satisfy the trim constraint. However, we recommend rotating
   the tail within the optimization process to obtain the best possible
   performance.}},

Title = {{A low-cost system for coil tracking during transcranial magnetic

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{337-346}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Accurate coil placement over a target area is critical during
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), as small deviations can alter
   testing outcomes. Accordingly, frameless stereotaxic systems (FSS) are
   recommended for reliable coil placement during TMS applications.
   However, FSS is not practical due to the cost associated with procuring
   such systems. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a
   low-cost TMS coil tracking approach using simple webcams and an image
   processing algorithm in LabVIEW Vision Assistant.
   Methods: A system was created using two webcams, retroreflective
   markers, and computer stereovision, for tracking the TMS coil over a
   target area. Accuracy of the system was validated in both the global and
   local reference frames, while repeatability was measured within-and
   between-days for placement of the TMS coil over the target area relative
   to the head. The feasibility of our system was also verified by
   collecting motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of first dorsal interosseous
   muscle from human subjects.
   Results: The results of this study indicated that the system was highly
   accurate and repeatable, and could track the coil position with <5mm
   error and orientation <1.1. error from the target. We also observed
   larger and more consistent MEPs when stimulating the brain using
   feedback from the coil tracking system than when the examiner attempted
   to stimulate without any feedback.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that webcam-based coil tracking is a
   feasible low-cost solution to track coil positions during TMS
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging of the abdominal skin of a guinea pig after injecting a

   revealed the epidermal and dermal layers which were stained well below
   60 mu m underneath the outer layer of the skin. An extensive network of
   cells was evident in the deeper layer of the stained dermis as the
   distributed fluorescein isothiocyanate dose was administered by repeated
   injection using a laser-based micro-jet. We performed optically
   controlled release of the drug by breaching the guinea pig's skin tissue
   targeting the region 10-400 mu m beneath the outermost layer. Tissue
   damage was minimized by reducing the injection volume to approximately
   100 nl per pulse. This was done using a micro-jet diameter equal to half
   of that of a conventional 200 mu m syringe needle. Thus, the optimally
   controlled delivery of liquid drugs using an irradiated laser pulse was
   shown to be possible.}},

Abstract = {{A novel, highly miniaturized, lightweight antenna operating at the

   achieve higher bandwidth, we introduce an electrically small folded
   dipole version of the same antenna having a fully balanced structure.
   The overall dimension and total mass of the proposed antenna are 10 x 10
   x 15 cm(3). (0.013 lambda(0) x 0.013 lambda(0) x 0.02 lambda(0) at 40
   MHz) and 98 g, respectively. The gain and pattern of the fabricated

Abstract = {{Although pentavalent uranium can exist in aqueous solution, its presence
   in the solid state is uncommon. Metal monouranates, MgUO4, CrUO4 and
   FeUO4 were synthesized for detailed structural and energetic
   investigations. Structural characteristics of these uranates used powder
   X-ray diffraction, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fe-57-Mossbauer spectroscopy. Enthalpies
   of formation were measured by high temperature oxide melt solution
   calorimetry. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided both
   structural and energetic information. The measured structural and
   thermodynamic properties show good consistency with those predicted from
   DFT. The presence of U5+ has been solidly confirmed in CrUO4 and FeUO4,
   which are thermodynamically stable compounds, and the origin and
   stability of U5+ in the system was elaborated by DFT. The structural and
   thermodynamic behaviour of U5+ elucidated in this work is relevant to
   fundamental actinide redox chemistry and to applications in the nuclear
   industry and radioactive waste disposal.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Random number generators are well known for their ubiquitous use in
   cryptography, statistical sampling, and computer simulations. In order
   to establish secure data transfers in cryptographic applications, these
   number generators need to reliably produce unpredictable numbers at a
   high rate. In this paper, by exploiting the metastability of the
   stressed straintronics (STR) device, we theoretically propose a
   proof-of-concept nanomagnetic-based scheme to generate random numbers at
   very high rates with low-energy overhead. The dynamic modeling of the
   device, including the Langevin thermal noise field, is discussed, and
   the effect of process variation on the energy barrier and reliability is
   analyzed. The device is interfaced with CMOS circuitry and simulated in
   the 65 nm technology. At 1 V supply level, the system can generate
   random numbers as fast as 510 MHz. The entire circuit, including the
   CMOS peripherals, consumes 12.5 uW at 100 MHz random number generation
   rate while dissipating merely 0.125 pJ/bit. By reducing the supply level
   to 0.5 V, the energy per bit can be reduced further to 19 fJ. Since the
   STR device can be placed on the top of the CMOS circuitry, the total
   area of the design is estimated to be 0.001 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the body size for
   6-12 year-old children as well as belt and seat design factors on injury
   outcomes in frontal crashes using computational simulations. Custom
   software was created to automatically scale and position a MADYMO child
   dummy model with an improved pelvis and abdomen geometry from child
   data. A parametric analysis of the effects from child size, seat belt
   anchorage locations, seat cushion length and seat stiffness on the
   injury predictors of child passengers aged between 6 and 12 in the
   FMVSS213 crash scenario was conducted. Child size was the dominant
   variable affecting the outcome measures. Seat design variables and the
   seat belt system variables had opposing effects on outcome measures,
   particularly between head and knee excursions, highlighting the
   importance of using optimisation techniques for future seat belt and
   seat designs to improve rear seat older child protection.}},

Title = {{A Three-Phase Shear-Lag Model for Longitudinal Cracking of a Ceramic
   Matrix Composite Ply With Thick Fiber Coatings}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{During progressive cracking of cross-ply ceramic matrix composites
   (CMCs), load is transferred from the fiber to the matrix in the
   longitudinal (0 deg) ply via shear through a compliant interphase layer,
   also referred to as the coating. In the material system of interest,
   this coating has significant thickness relative to the fiber diameter.
   The damage process in the cross-ply CMC is observed to be as follows:
   (1) elastic deformation, (2) cracking of the transverse plies, (3)
   matrix cracking within the longitudinal plies, (4) failure of
   longitudinal fibers, and (5) pullout of the cracked fibers from the
   matrix. In this paper, the focus is on the longitudinal (0 deg) ply.
   Existing shear-lag models do not fully represent either the stress
   transfer through the coating or the true accumulations of shear and
   normal stresses in the matrix. In the current study, a model is
   developed that takes into account both of these factors to provide a
   more accurate, analytical representation of the stress distribution and
   progressive damage accumulation in a longitudinal CMC ply.}},

Abstract = {{Despite their promise, the efficiency of quantum dot solar cells is

   alkaline environment required for chemical bath deposition of PbS. The
   morphology and properties of these films are strongly affected by
   altering the solution pH, temperature and the reagent concentrations. A
   detailed structural and chemical analysis reveals the different
   orientation relationships present between the constituent layers and
   highlights the spontaneous formation of new, distinct intermediate
   layers in the unique local environment formed due to the simultaneous
   dissolution of the ZnTe layers in the presence of precursors for PbS

Abstract = {{Despite a decade of engineering and process improvements, bacterial
   infection remains the primary threat to implanted medical devices. Zinc
   oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) have demonstrated antimicrobial
   properties. Their microbial selectivity, stability, ease of production,
   and low cost make them attractive alternatives to silver NPs or
   antimicrobial peptides. Here we sought to (1) determine the relative
   efficacy of ZnO-NPs on planktonic growth of medically relevant
   pathogens; (2) establish the role of bacterial surface chemistry on
   ZnO-NP effectiveness; (3) evaluate NP shape as a factor in the
   dose-response; and (4) evaluate layer-by-layer (LBL) ZnO-NP surface
   coatings on biofilm growth. ZnO-NPs inhibited bacterial growth in a
   shape-dependent manner not previously seen or predicted. Pyramid shaped
   particles were the most effective and contrary to previous work, larger
   particles were more effective than smaller particles. Differential
   susceptibility of pathogens may be related to their surface
   hydrophobicity. LBL ZnO-NO coatings reduced staphylococcal biofilm
   burden by >95\%.
   From the Clinical Editor: The use of medical implants is widespread.
   However, bacterial colonization remains a major concern. In this
   article, the authors investigated the use of zinc oxide nanoparticles
   (ZnO-NPs) to prevent bacterial infection. They showed in their
   experiments that ZnO-NPs significantly inhibited bacterial growth. This
   work may present a new alternative in using ZnO-NPs in medical devices.

Abstract = {{Lead-free piezoelectric nanowires (NWs) show strong potential in sensing
   and energy harvesting applications due to their flexibility and ability
   to convert mechanical energy to electric energy. Currently, most
   lead-free piezoelectric NWs are produced through low yield synthesis
   methods and result in low electromechanical coupling, which limit their
   efficiency as energy harvesters. In order to alleviate these issues, a
   scalable method is developed to synthesize perovskite type
   0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O-3-0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZTBCT) NWs with high
   piezoelectric coupling coefficient. The piezoelectric coupling
   coefficient of the BZT-BCT NWs is measured by a refined piezoresponse
   force microscopy (PFM) testing method and shows the highest reported
   coupling coefficient for lead-free piezoelectric nanowires of 90 +/- 5
   pm V-1. Flexible nanocomposites utilizing dispersed BZT-BCT NWs are
   fabricated to demonstrate an energy harvesting application with an open
   circuit voltage of up to 6.25 V and a power density of up to 2.25 mu W
   cm(-3). The high electromechanical coupling coefficient and high power
   density demonstrated with these lead-free NWs produced via a scalable
   synthesis method shows the potential for high performance NW-based
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-free organic phosphors can be an attractive smart optical sensing
   materials since, in such compounds, intersystem crossing (ISC) and the

   investigated how physicochemical properties of organic solvents affect

   rationally adapting the finding into phosphor-doped electrospun polymer
   fibers, we developed a new luminometric sensory platform and achieved
   selective detection of eight different common organic solvents. The

Abstract = {{Observations of the green and red-doublet emission lines have previously
   been realized for several comets. We present here a chemistry-emission
   coupled model to study the production and loss mechanisms of the O(S-1)
   and O(D-1) states, which are responsible for the emission lines of
   interest for comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The recent discovery of
   O-2 in significant abundance relative to water 3.800.85 within the coma
   of 67P has been taken into consideration for the first time in such
   models. We evaluate the effect of the presence of O-2 on the green to
   red-doublet emission intensity ratio, which is traditionally used to
   assess the CO2 abundance within cometary atmospheres. Model simulations,
   solving the continuity equation with transport, show that not taking O-2
   into account leads to an underestimation of the CO2 abundance within
   67P, with a relative error of about 25\%. This strongly suggests that
   the green to red-doublet emission intensity ratio alone is not a proper
   tool for determining the CO2 abundance, as previously suggested. Indeed,
   there is no compelling reason why O-2 would not be a common cometary
   volatile, making revision of earlier assessments regarding the CO2
   abundance in cometary atmospheres necessary. The large uncertainties of
   the CO2 photodissociation cross section imply that more studies are
   required in order to better constrain the O(S-1) and O(D-1) production
   through this mechanism. Space weather phenomena, such as powerful solar
   flares, could be used as tools for doing so, providing additional
   information on a good estimation of the O-2 abundance within cometary
   atmospheres.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic metal welding is used for joining lithium-ion batteries of
   electric vehicles. The monitoring of battery joining processes requires
   near-zero misdetection in order to prevent any battery joints with a low
   quality connection going into the downstream assembly. The conventional
   control chart techniques widely used in many process monitoring systems
   were designed based on a pre-specified false alarm rate. To ensure weld
   quality and reduce manual inspection at the same time, a near-zero
   misdetection rate is desired foremost while achieving a low false alarm
   rate. A monitoring algorithm targeting near-zero misdetection is
   developed in this article by integrating univariate control charts and
   the Mahalanobis distance approach. The proposed algorithm is capable of
   monitoring non-normal multivariate observations with flexible control
   limits to achieve a near-zero misdetection rate while keeping a low
   false alarm rate. By implementing this algorithm on the ultrasonic
   welding process of battery manufacturing, the developed algorithm proves
   to be effective in achieving near-zero misdetection in process
   monitoring to ensure battery weld quality. The developed algorithm also
   shows great potential for monitoring other processes that target at
   near-zero misdetection. (C) 2016 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

Abstract = {{A low triplet energy host material with thermally activated delayed
   fluorescence character was applied as the host material of a blue
   phosphorescent emitter and was compared with a high triplet energy host
   material. The low triplet energy host material had triplet energy lower
   than the triplet energy of the triplet emitter and singlet energy higher
   than the triplet energy of the triplet emitter. The low triplet energy
   host material performed as well as a high triplet energy host material
   in terms of quantum efficiency by recycling triplet excitons of the
   phosphorescent emitter via an up-conversion process, but performed
   better than high triplet energy host materials in terms of driving
   voltage. Therefore, the thermally activated delayed fluorescence type
   low triplet energy host material increased the power efficiency of the
   devices. An energy transfer process from the low triplet energy host to
   the triplet emitter through the conversion of triplet excitons into
   singlet excitons was proposed and confirmed as the mechanism of
   efficient light emission.}},

   Magnesium}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},

Abstract = {{A new model of electrodeposition and electrodissolution is developed and
   applied to the evolution of Mg deposits during anode cycling. The model
   captures Butler-Volmer kinetics, facet evolution, the spatially varying
   potential in the electrolyte, and the time-dependent electrolyte
   concentration. The model utilizes a diffuse interface approach,
   employing the phase field and smoothed boundary methods. Scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) images of magnesium deposited on a gold
   substrate show the formation of faceted deposits, often in the form of
   hexagonal prisms. Orientation-dependent reaction rate coefficients were
   parameterized using the experimental SEM images. Three-dimensional
   simulations of the growth of magnesium deposits yield deposit
   morphologies consistent with the experimental results. The simulations
   predict that the deposits become narrower and taller as the current
   density increases due to the depletion of the electrolyte concentration
   near the sides of the deposits. Increasing the distance between the
   deposits leads to increased depletion of the electrolyte surrounding the
   deposit. Two models relating the orientation-dependence of the
   deposition and dissolution reactions are presented. The morphology of
   the Mg deposit after one deposition-dissolution cycle is significantly
   different between the two orientation-dependence models, providing
   testable predictions that suggest the underlying physical mechanisms
   governing morphology evolution during deposition and dissolution. (C)

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a core/shell nanodimer of gold (core) and silver
   iodine (shell) as a dual-modal contrast-enhancing agent for biomarker
   targeted x-ray computed tomography (CT) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI)
   applications.
   Methods: The gold and silver iodine core/shell nanodimer (Au/AgICSD) was
   prepared by fusing together components of gold, silver, and iodine. The
   physicochemical properties of Au/AgICSD were then characterized using
   different optical and imaging techniques (e.g., HR-transmission electron
   microscope, scanning transmission electron microscope, x-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy,
   Z-potential, and UV-vis). The CT and PAI contrast-enhancing effects were
   tested and then compared with a clinically used CT contrast agent and Au
   nanoparticles. To confer biocompatibility and the capability for
   efficient biomarker targeting, the surface of the Au/AgICSD nanodimer
   was modified with the amphiphilic diblock polymer and then
   functionalized with transferrin for targeting transferrin receptor that
   is overexpressed in various cancer cells. Cytotoxicity of the prepared
   Au/AgICSD nanodimer was also tested with both normal and cancer cell
   lines.
   Results: The characterizations of prepared Au/AgI core/shell
   nanostructure confirmed the formation of Au/AgICSD nanodimers. Au/AgICSD
   nanodimer is stable in physiological conditions for in vivo
   applications. Au/AgICSD nanodimer exhibited higher contrast enhancement
   in both CT and PAI for dual-modality imaging. Moreover, transferrin
   functionalized Au/AgICSD nanodimer showed specific binding to the tumor
   cells that have a high level of expression of the transferrin receptor.
   Conclusions: The developed Au/AgICSD nanodimer can be used as a
   potential biomarker targeted dual-modal contrast agent for both or
   combined CT and PAI molecular imaging. (C) 2016 American Association of

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{4134-4144}},
Abstract = {{There continues to be a significant increase in the number and
   complexity of hydrophobic nanomaterials that are engineered for a
   variety of commercial purposes making human exposure a significant
   health concern. This study uses a combination of biophysical,
   biochemical and computational methods to probe potential mechanisms for
   uptake of C-60 nanoparticles into various compartments of living immune
   cells. Cultures of RAW 264.7 immortalized murine macrophage were used as
   a canonical model of immune-competent cells that are likely to provide
   the first line of defense following inhalation. Modes of entry studied
   were endocytosis/pinocytosis and passive permeation of cellular
   membranes. The evidence suggests marginal uptake of C-60 clusters is
   achieved through endocytosis/pinocytosis, and that passive diffusion
   into membranes provides a significant source of biologically-available
   nanomaterial. Computational modeling of both a single molecule and a
   small cluster of fullerenes predicts that low concentrations of
   fullerenes enter the membrane individually and produce limited
   perturbation; however, at higher concentrations the clusters in the
   membrane causes deformation of the membrane. These findings are
   bolstered by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of model membranes that
   reveal deformation of the cell membrane upon exposure to high
   concentrations of fullerenes. The atomistic and NMR models fail to
   explain escape of the particle out of biological membranes, but are
   limited to idealized systems that do not completely recapitulate the
   complexity of cell membranes. The surprising contribution of passive
   modes of cellular entry provides new avenues for toxicological research
   that go beyond the pharmacological inhibition of bulk transport systems
   such as pinocytosis.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption isotherms of naphthalene on three typical mesoporous
   adsorbents, mesosilicas MCM-41 and SBA-15, and mesocarbon CMK-3 were
   determined by column tests at 125 degrees C, with feed concentrations
   ranging from 7.63 x 10(-5) to 4.64 x 10(-2) mol m(-3) (1.88 to 1140
   ppm). The Langmuir model and constant-pattern wave propagation model
   were found to well fit the isotherms and the breakthrough curves,
   respectively. Regenerabilities of the mesoporous samples and a benchmark
   activated carbon (AC) were characterized based on thermogravimetric
   analysis (TGA). The results show mesoporosity significantly reduced the
   internal mass-transfer resistance, contributing to facile desorption and
   to fast adsorption kinetics shown by high overall mass-transfer rate
   coefficient following the order of: CMK-3 > SBA-15 > MCM-41.
   Micropore-mesopore coexisting structures present in CMK-3 and SBA-15
   facilitated the adsorption at very low concentrations due to
   micropore-filling, while greater surface hydrophobicity and micropore
   abundance on CMK-3 exhibited larger affinity for nonpolar naphthalene,
   rendering the highest adsorption capacity (1.014 mol m(-3)) among all
   sorbents including ACs. SBA-15 showed higher regenerability with a
   desorption temperature below 440 K, owing to the weaker binding and
   diffusion advantages contributed by the interconnectivity between
   primary mesopores.}},

Abstract = {{An improved coherent branching model for L-band radar remote sensing of
   soybean is proposed by taking into account the correlated scattering
   among scatterers. The novel feature of the analytical coherent model
   consists of conditional probability functions to eliminate the
   overlapping effects of branches in the former branching models.
   Backscattering coefficients are considered for a variety of scenarios
   over the full growth cycle for vegetation water content (VWC) and the
   complete drydown conditions for soil moisture. The results of the
   coherent model show that HH scattering has a significant difference up
   to 3 dB from that of the independent scattering when VWC is low, e.g.,
   0.2 kg/m(2). Forward model calculations are performed for the scattering
   from the soybean field for the full range of three axes of
   root-mean-square (RMS) height of bare soil, VWC, and soil moisture using
   the coherent model. The soybean volume scattering including the
   double-bounce term is combined with the back scattering of bare soil
   from the numerical Maxwell solutions that incorporates RMS height, soil
   permittivity, and correlation length, to form the forward model lookup
   table for the vegetated soil. The results are compared with data from 13
   soybean fields collected as part of the soil moisture active passive
   validation experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12). Time-series retrieval of soil
   moisture is also applied to the soybean fields by inverting the forward
   model lookup table. During the retrieval, the VWC is optimized with

Abstract = {{Because Rn-222 is a progeny of U-238, the relative abundance of uranium
   may be used to predict the areas that have the potential for high indoor
   radon concentration and therefore determine the best areas to conduct
   future surveys. Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping software was
   used to construct maps of South Dakota that included levels of uranium
   concentrations in soil and stream water and uranium deposits. Maps of
   existing populations and the types of land were also generated. Existing
   data about average indoor radon levels by county taken from a databank
   were included for consideration. Although the soil and stream data and
   existing recorded average indoor radon levels were sparse, it was
   determined that the most likely locations of elevated indoor radon would
   be in the northwest and southwest corners of the state. Indoor radon
   levels were only available for 9 out of 66 counties in South Dakota.
   This sparcity of data precluded a study of correlation of radon to
   geological features, but further motivates the need for more testing in
   the state. Only actual measurements should be used to determine levels
   of indoor radon because of the strong roles home construction and
   localized geology play in radon concentration. However, the data
   visualization method demonstrated here is potentially useful for
   directing resources relating to radon screening campaigns.}},

   and photoneutron generation from molybdenum vs. tungsten}},

Abstract = {{A new ``one-stage{''} approach for production of Mo-99 and other
   radioisotopes by means of an electron linear accelerator is described.
   It is based on using a molybdenum target both as a bremsstrahlung
   converter and as a radioisotope producing target for the production of
   Mo-99 via the photoneutron reaction Mo-100(gamma, n)Mo-99.
   Bremsstrahlung characteristics, such as bremsstrahlung efficiency,
   angular distribution, and energy deposition for molybdenum targets were
   obtained by means of the EGSnrc Monte Carlo simulation code system. As a
   result of our simulations, it is concluded that a 60 MeV electron beam
   incident on a thick Mo target will have greater bremsstrahlung
   efficiency than the same thickness (in units of r(0)) W target, for
   target thickness z > 1.84r(0), where r(0) is the electron range. A 50
   MeV electron beam incident on a Mo target will result in greater
   bremsstrahlung efficiency than the same thickness W target (in units of
   r(0)) for target thickness case: z >= 2.0r(0). It is shown for the
   one-stage approach with thicknesses of (1.84-2.0)r(0), that the
   Mo-99-production bremsstrahlung efficiency of a molybdenum target is
   greater by similar to 100\% at 30 MeV and by similar to 70\% at 60 MeV
   compared to the values for tungsten of the same thickness (in units of
   the appropriate r(0)) in the traditional two-stage approach (W converter
   and separate Mo-99 producing target). This advantage of the one-stage
   approach arises from the fact that the bremsstrahlung produced is
   attenuated only once from attenuation in the molybdenum
   converter/target. In the traditional, two-stage approach, the
   bremsstrahlung generated in the W-converter/target is attenuated both in
   the converter in the Mo-99-producing molybdenum target.
   The photoneutron production yield of molybdenum and tantalum (as a
   substitute for tungsten) target was calculated by means of the MCNP5
   transport code. On the basis of these data, the specific activity for
   the one-stage approach of three enriched Mo-100-targets of a 2 cm
   diameter and thicknesses of 1, 2, and 3 radiation lengths (RL) were
   calculated to be: 19.54 Ci/g, 23.05 Ci/g, and 21.23 Ci/g, respectively.
   These results were compared with the evaluation presented in by Diamond
   et al. {[}19] for the same diameter and thickness Mo-100-targets in a
   two-stage approach. The comparison demonstrates that for all thicknesses
   under consideration, the specific activities at equilibrium in the
   one-stage approach are substantially greater than those evaluated in
   Diamond et al. {[}19] for the two-stage approach. More specifically, the
   specific activities at equilibrium in the Mo converter/target approach
   are greater than those in the standard W converter/Mo target approach at
   Mo-100 target thicknesses of 1RL, 2RL, and 3RL by 28.9\%, 82.5\%, and
   80.1\%, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report the results of experimental and numerical-simulation studies
   of shielded radiography using narrowband MeV-energy X-rays from a
   compact all-laser-driven inverse-Compton-scattering X-ray light source.
   This recently developed X-ray light source is based on a laser-wakefield
   accelerator with ultra-high-field gradient (GeV/cm). We demonstrate
   experimentally high-quality radiographic imaging (image contrast of 0.4
   and signal-to-noise ratio of 2:1) of a target composed of 8-mm thick
   depleted uranium shielded by 80-mm thick steel, using a 6-MeV X-ray beam
   with a spread of 45\% (FWHM) and 10(7) photons in a single shot. The
   corresponding dose of the X-ray pulse measured in front of the target is
   similar to 100 nGy/pulse. Simulations performed using the Monte-Carlo
   code MCNPX accurately reproduce the experimental results. These
   simulations also demonstrate that the narrow bandwidth of the Compton
   X-ray source operating at 6 and 9 MeV leads to a reduction of deposited
   dose as compared to broadband bremsstrahlung sources with the same
   end-point energy. The X-ray beam's inherently low-divergence angle
   (similar to mrad) is advantageous and effective for interrogation at
   standoff distance. These results demonstrate significant benefits of
   all-laser driven Compton X-rays for shielded radiography. (C) 2015

Title = {{Characterization of the crosslinking kinetics of multi-arm poly(ethylene

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{2076-2085}},
Abstract = {{Tunable properties of multi-arm poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel,
   crosslinked by Michael-type addition, support diverse applications in
   tissue engineering. Bioactive modification of PEG is achieved by
   incorporating integrin binding sequences, like RGD, and crosslinking
   with tri-functional protease sensitive crosslinking peptide
   (GCYKNRGCYKNRCG), which compete for the same reactive groups in PEG.
   This competition leads to a narrow range of conditions that support
   sufficient crosslinking density to provide structural control. Kinetics
   of hydrogel formation plays an important role in defining the conditions
   to form hydrogels with desired mechanical and biological properties,
   which have not been fully characterized. In this study, we explored how
   increasing PEG functionality from 4 to 8-arms and the concentration of
   biological moieties, ranging from 0.5 mM to 3.75 mM, affected the
   kinetics of hydrogel formation, storage modulus, and swelling after the
   hydrogels were allowed to form for 15 or 60 minutes. Next, human bone
   marrow stromal cells were encapsulated and cultured in these modified
   hydrogels to investigate the combined effect of mechano-biological
   properties on phenotypes of encapsulated cells. While the molar
   concentration of the reactive functional groups (-vinyl sulfone) was
   identical in the conditions comparing 4 and 8-arm PEG, the 8-arm PEG
   formed faster, allowed a greater degree of modification, and was
   superior in three-dimensional culture. The degrees of swelling and
   storage modulus of 8-arm PEG were less affected by the modification
   compared to 4-arm PEG. These findings suggest that 8-arm PEG allows a
   more precise control of mechanical properties that could lead to a
   larger spectrum of tissue engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{The aerodynamic shape optimization of wings in transonic flow is an
   inherently challenging problem. In addition to the high computational
   cost of solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, there is
   a complex interdependence between the cross-sectional shape, wave drag,
   and viscous effects. Furthermore, it is necessary to perform multipoint
   optimizations to ensure good performance for a range of flight
   conditions. The choice of which flight conditions should be considered
   in a multipoint optimization and how many of these should be considered
   is still not well understood. This paper addresses this issue by solving
   a series of seven benchmark optimizations developed by the AIAA
   Aerodynamic Optimization Discussion Group. These optimization cases
   include a single-point optimization, four three-point optimizations, a
   nine-point optimization, and a five-point optimization. The
   optimizations consist in minimizing the weighted drag coefficient
   subject to lift, moment, thickness, and volume constraints. The
   optimizations were performed with respect to 768 shape design variables
   and an angle of attack for each flight condition. The single-point
   optimization was able to achieve an 8.1\% drag reduction relative to the
   initial design, but it exhibited poor off-design performance. All the
   optimized designs were compared using a contour plot of ML/cD to
   evaluate the wing performance over the complete transonic flight
   operating envelope. Each of the four three-point optimizations
   successfully mitigated the poor off-design performance of the
   single-point design. However, the three-point optimization with widely
   spaced Mach numbers yielded a much more complex ML/cD contour with two
   distinct local maxima. Finally, the five- and nine-point optimizations
   yielded similar performance and the most robust off-design performance.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{634-643}},
Abstract = {{Continuous power generation from energy harvesting systems is dependent
   on their mechanical strength as they convert wasted mechanical energy
   into useful electrical energy. Here, the first generation of high
   strength, fiber-based energy harvesters is developed through a simple,
   scalable and cost-effective process. To fabricate these light yet robust
   energy harvesting materials, vertically aligned ZnO nanowires are grown
   on the fibers' surface of a woven aramid fabric. The ZnO nanostructured
   interface is used as a functional unit as well as a reinforcement
   component. The power harvesting performance of these hybrid composites
   is demonstrated through direct vibration examination of a fabricated
   cantilever beam. The fabricated hybrid composite energy harvester beam
   produced a high open circuit voltage of similar to 125 mV root mean
   square (and similar to 0.4 V peak-to-peak) when subjected to a cyclic
   base acceleration of only 1g root mean square. Moreover, assessing the
   structural performance of these composites revealed significant increase
   in the elastic modulus and tensile strength of the composites by 34.3\%
   and 18.4\%, respectively. These results indicate that integrating ZnO
   nanowire arrays not only provides energy harvesting capability, but also
   enhances the mechanical properties of the composite. This methodology
   can be considered as the first development of a high strength material
   with embedded energy harvesting and thus demonstrates multifunctional
   materials with improved strength and functionality.}},

Title = {{Prediction Research of Red Tide Based on Improved FCM}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Red tides are caused by the combination effects of many marine elements.
   The complexity of the marine ecosystem makes it hard to find the
   relationship between marine elements and red tides. The algorithm of
   fuzzy c-means (FCM) can get clear classification of things and expresses
   the fuzzy state among different things. Therefore, a prediction
   algorithm of red tide based on improved FCM is proposed. In order to
   overcome the defect of FCM which is overdependent on the initial cluster
   centers and the objective function, this paper gains the initial cluster
   centers through the principle of regional minimum data density and the
   minimum mean distance. The feature weighted cluster center is added to
   the objective function. Finally, the improved FCM algorithm is applied
   in the prediction research of red tide, and the results show that the
   improved FCM algorithm has good denoising ability and high accuracy in
   the prediction of red tides.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Dopamine cell firing can encode errors in reward prediction, providing a
   learning signal to guide future behavior. Yet dopamine is also a key
   modulator of motivation, invigorating current behavior. Existing
   theories propose that fast (phasic) dopamine fluctuations support
   learning, whereas much slower (tonic) dopamine changes are involved in
   motivation. We examined dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens across
   multiple time scales, using complementary microdialysis and voltammetric
   methods during adaptive decision-making. We found that minute-by-minute
   dopamine levels covaried with reward rate and motivational vigor.
   Second-by-second dopamine release encoded an estimate of temporally
   discounted future reward (a value function). Changing dopamine
   immediately altered willingness to work and reinforced preceding action
   choices by encoding temporal-difference reward prediction errors. Our
   results indicate that dopamine conveys a single, rapidly evolving
   decision variable, the available reward for investment of effort, which
   is employed for both learning and motivational functions.}},

Abstract = {{Multichannel autofocus (MCA) is a subspace-based autofocus method for
   solving the defocusing problem in synthetic aperture radar. In addition
   to the one-dimensional (1D) defocusing assumption, MCA assumes that the
   perfectly focused image has a low-return region, which is naturally
   guaranteed by the spatially limited nature of the radar antenna
   footprint. In theory, MCA yields better or even perfect solutions
   compared to other autofocus methods. However, the authors have
   discovered that MCA is far more sensitive to violation of the 1D
   defocusing assumption compared to other methods; in fact, MCA is
   unsuitable for even fairly small data-collection angles. Fortunately,
   this problem can be solved if they reverse the order of two steps in the
   image formation process and apply MCA in a domain where the defocusing
   effect is one dimensional. The distorted version of the image, obtained
   by inverse Fourier transforming the polar-grid data without further
   interpolation, contains regions satisfying a low-return assumption, but
   the region of low return must be carefully specified for best
   performance. They present simulation results of the proposed method,
   reversed-step MCA, for various ranges of look angles and discuss the
   selection of low-return constraints.}},

Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{Persistent staphylococcal infections often involve surface-associated
   communities called biofilms. Staphylococcus aureus biofilm development
   is mediated by the co-ordinated production of the biofilm matrix, which
   can be composed of polysaccharides, extracellular DNA (eDNA) and
   proteins including amyloid fibers. The nature of the interactions
   between matrix components, and how these interactions contribute to the
   formation of matrix, remain unclear. Here we show that the presence of
   eDNA in S. aureus biofilms promotes the formation of amyloid fibers.
   Conditions or mutants that do not generate eDNA result in lack of
   amyloids during biofilm growth despite the amyloidogeneic subunits,
   phenol soluble modulin peptides, being produced. In vitro studies
   revealed that the presence of DNA promotes amyloid formation by PSM
   peptides. Thus, this work exposes a previously unacknowledged
   interaction between biofilm matrix components that furthers our
   understanding of functional amyloid formation and S. aureus biofilm
   biology.}},

Title = {{Evidence and implications of direct charge excitation as the dominant
   mechanism in plasmon-mediated photocatalysis}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Plasmonic metal nanoparticles enhance chemical reactions on their
   surface when illuminated with light of particular frequencies. It has
   been shown that these processes are driven by excitation of localized
   surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The interaction of LSPR with adsorbate
   orbitals can lead to the injection of energized charge carriers into the
   adsorbate, which can result in chemical transformations. The mechanism
   of the charge injection process (and role of LSPR) is not well
   understood. Here we shed light on the specifics of this mechanism by
   coupling optical characterization methods, mainly wavelength-dependent
   Stokes and anti-Stokes SERS, with kinetic analysis of photocatalytic
   reactions in an Ag nanocube-methylene blue plasmonic system. We propose
   that localized LSPR-induced electric fields result in a direct charge
   transfer within the molecule-adsorbate system. These observations
   provide a foundation for the development of plasmonic catalysts that can
   selectively activate targeted chemical bonds, since the mechanism allows
   for tuning plasmonic nanomaterials in such a way that illumination can
   selectively enhance desired chemical pathways.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are being developed to enhance tissue regeneration.
   Here we show that a hyperbranched polymer with high miRNA-binding
   affinity and negligible cytotoxicity can self-assemble into nano-sized
   polyplexes with a `double-shell' miRNA distribution and high
   transfection efficiency. These polyplexes are encapsulated in
   biodegradable microspheres to enable controllable two-stage (polyplexes
   and miRNA) delivery. The microspheres are attached to cell-free
   nanofibrous polymer scaffolds that spatially control the release of
   miR-26a. This technology is used to regenerate critical-sized bone
   defects in osteoporotic mice by targeting Gsk-3b to activate the
   osteoblastic activity of endogenous stem cells, thus addressing a
   critical challenge in regenerative medicine of achieving cell-free
   scaffold-based miRNA therapy for tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{A novel conjugated polymer, PVBT, having a D-A type alternating
   configuration is synthesized for organic photovoltaic application. It
   exhibits a bimodal-shaped absorption because of intramolecular charge
   transfer. Comparison of absorption intensity both in the long and the
   short wavelength region indicates decent chain planarity of PVBT.
   Organic photovoltaic devices made of PVBT exhibit better performance
   compared to identical devices from PVTT having a similar chemical
   structure due to a deeper HOMO energy level and a lower band-gap of
   PVBT. Additive assisted annealing further improves the device
   performance, and film morphology analysis reveals the importance of
   nano-dimensional phase separation to suppress inner-domain
   recombination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Polycondensation Reactions}},
Journal = {{ACS MACRO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{74-77}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Catalyst-transfer polycondensation (CTP) is a relatively new method for
   synthesizing conjugated polymers in a chain growth fashion using
   transition metal catalysis. Recent research has focused on screening
   catalysts to broaden the monomer scope. In this effort, small molecule
   reactions have played an important role. Specifically, when selective
   difunctionalization occurs, even with limiting quantities of reaction
   partner, it suggests an associative intermediate similar to CTP. Several
   new chain-growth polymerizations have been discovered using this
   approach. We report herein an attempt to use this method to develop
   chain-growth conditions for synthesizing poly(2,5-bis(hexyloxy)phenylene
   ethynylene) via Sonogashira cross-coupling. Hundreds of small molecule
   experiments were performed and selective difunctionalization was
   observed with a Buchwald-type precatalyst. Unexpectedly, these same
   reaction conditions led to a step-growth polymerization. Further
   investigation revealed that the product ratios in the small molecule
   reactions were dictated by reactivity differences rather than an
   associative intermediate. The lessons learned from these studies have
   broad implications on other small molecule reactions being used to
   identify new catalysts for CTP.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of nanostructured particles in high-temperature flames is
   important both for the control of emissions from combustion devices and
   for the synthesis of high-value chemicals for a variety of applications.
   The physiochemical processes that lead to the production of fine
   particles in turbulent flames are highly sensitive to the flow physics
   and, in particular, the history of thermochemical compositions and
   turbulent features they encounter. Consequently, it is possible to
   change the characteristic size, structure, composition, and yield of the
   fine particles by altering the flow configuration. This review describes
   the complex multiscale interactions among turbulent fluid flow,
   gas-phase chemical reactions, and solid-phase particle evolution. The
   focus is on modeling the generation of soot particles, an unwanted
   pollutant from automobile and aircraft engines, as well as metal oxides,
   a class of high-value chemicals sought for specialized applications,
   including emissions control. Issues arising due to the numerical methods
   used to approximate the particle number density function, the modeling
   of turbulence-chemistry interactions, and model validation are also
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{112-122}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A robust data assimilation scheme is presented for a wave model to
   predict evolving nonlinear ocean waves. The Fourier coefficients of the
   surface elevation and the free surface velocity potential are chosen for
   state variables and are propagated in time by solving numerically a set
   of nonlinear evolution equations using a pseudo-spectral method. The
   numerical solutions are then updated with noise corrupted measurements
   of the surface elevation with the aid of an explicit Kalman filter for
   which the time evolution of the error covariance matrix is found
   explicitly by solving analytically the linearized wave prediction model.
   After presenting an error analysis for this explicit data assimilation
   scheme, numerical simulations of the integrated nonlinear wave
   prediction model for long-crested waves of varying wave steepness are
   performed by using synthetic data with different noise characteristics.
   It is shown that the estimated surface wave fields agree well with the
   true states, and the present data assimilation scheme based on the
   explicit Kalman filter improves considerably the computational
   efficiency and stability, in comparison with a standard Kalman filter
   for which the error covariance matrix is found numerically.}},

Abstract = {{Metal nanoparticles are garnering considerable attention owing to their
   high potential for use in various applications in the material,
   electronics, and energy industries. Recent research efforts have focused
   on the biosynthesis of metal nanomaterials using microorganisms rather
   than traditional chemical synthesis methods. Microorganisms have evolved
   to possess molecular machineries for detoxifying heavy metals, mainly by
   employing metal-binding proteins and peptides. Biosynthesis of diverse
   metal nanoparticles has recently been demonstrated using such heavy
   metal detoxification systems in microorganisms, which provides several
   advantages over the traditional chemical synthesis methods. First, metal
   nanoparticles can be synthesized at mild temperatures, such as at room
   temperature, with less energy input. Second, no toxic chemicals or
   reagents are needed, and thus the process is environmentally friendly.
   Third, diverse metal nanoparticles, including those that have never been
   chemically synthesized, can be biosynthesized. Here, we review the
   strategies for the biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles using
   microorganisms, and provide future prospects.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{471-481}},
Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have attracted great interest in the field
   of regenerative medicine, particularly in bone regeneration. Osteogenic
   differentiation from MSCs is regulated by various environmental factors
   including hormones, growth factors, chemicals and physical cues from
   biomaterials. We present the use of electroactive degradable copolymers
   to guide the osteogenic differentiation from bone marrow derived MSCs
   (BMSCs). The biodegradable conductive copolymers based on polylactide
   and tunable contents of the aniline oligomer were synthesized by ring
   opening polymerization and free radical polymerization, and subsequent
   functionalization with the aniline tetramer. Electroactive nanofibrous
   scaffolds were created via a thermally induced phase separation
   technique. The cell culture of BMSCs and MC3T3-E1 cells on electroactive
   copolymers showed that these copolymers were cytocompatible and the
   proliferation for both cells was significantly enhanced. Osteogenic
   differentiation from BMSCs on the electroactive copolymers was promoted
   compared to polylactide in terms of gene expression and von Kossa
   staining. Furthermore, protein adsorption on the electroactive copolymer
   surface was greatly increased, and this may contribute to the enhanced
   proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs. This is the first report
   about degradable electroactive polymers directing osteogenic
   differentiation from BMSCs and the results indicated that electroactive
   degradable polymers have great potential for application in bone
   regeneration.}},

Title = {{Development of an endoluminal intestinal attachment for a clinically
   applicable distraction enterogenesis device}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{101-106}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Previous methods of distraction enterogenesis have relied upon
   blind-ending intestinal segments or transmural device fixation,
   requiring multiple operations and potential bowel injury. We
   hypothesized that using a novel attachment would allow reversible device
   coupling to the luminal bowel surface, achieving effective endoluminal
   distraction.
   Methods: A telescopic hydraulic device was designed with latex balloon
   attachments covered with high-friction mesh and a dilating fenestrated
   elastic mask (DFM attachment), allowing mesh-to-mucosa contact only with
   inflation. Yorkshire pigs underwent jejunal Roux-en-Y limb creation and
   device placement via jejunostomy. Devices underwent 3 cycles of balloon
   inflation and hydraulic extension/retraction per day for 7 days and then
   explanted and studied for efficacy.
   Results: DFM attachment allowed reversible, high-strength endoluminal
   coupling without tissue injury or reduction in bowel perfusion. After 7
   day implant, distracted bowel achieved a 44 +/- 2\% increase in length
   vs. fed, nondistracted bowel, corresponding to a gain of 7.1 +/- 0.3 cm.
   Distracted bowel demonstrated increased epithelial cell proliferation
   vs. control bowel. Attachment sites demonstrated villus flattening,
   increased crypt depth, thicker muscularis mucosa, and unchanged
   muscularis propria thickness vs. control.
   Conclusion: Novel high-strength, reversible attachments enabled fully
   endoluminal distraction enterogenesis, achieving length gains comparable
   to open surgical techniques. This approach may allow development of
   clinically applicable technology for SBS treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{353-359}},
Abstract = {{An optofluidic FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) laser is
   formed by putting FRET pairs inside a microcavity acting as a gain
   medium. This integration of an optofluidic laser and the FRET mechanism
   provides novel research frontiers, including sensitive biochemical
   analysis and novel photonic devices, such as on-chip coherent light
   sources and bio-tunable lasers. Here, we investigated an optofluidic
   FRET laser using quantum dots (QDs) as FRET donors. We achieved lasing
   from Cy5 as the acceptor in a QD-Cy5 pair upon excitation at 450 nm,
   where Cy5 has negligible absorption by itself. The threshold was
   approximately 14 mu J mm(-2). The demonstrated capability of QDs as
   donors in the FRET laser greatly improves the versatility of optofluidic
   laser operation due to the broad and large absorption cross section of
   the QDs in the blue and UV spectral regions. The excitation efficiency
   of the acceptor molecules through a FRET channel was also analyzed,
   showing that the energy transfer rate and the non-radiative Auger
   recombination rate of QDs play a significant role in FRET laser
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical junctionless transistors with a gate-all-around (GAA) structure
   based on Ge/Si core/shell nano-wires epitaxially grown and integrated on
   a < 111 > Si substrate were fabricated and analyzed. Because of
   efficient gate coupling in the nanowire-GAA transistor structure and the
   high density one-dimensional hole gas formed in the Ge nanowire core,
   excellent P-type transistor behaviors with I-on of 750 mu A/mu m were
   obtained at a moderate gate length of 544 nm with minimal short-channel
   effects. The experimental data can be quantitatively modeled by a GAA
   junctionless transistor model with few fitting parameters, suggesting
   the nanowire transistors can be fabricated reliably without introducing
   additional factors that can degrade device performance. Devices with
   different gate lengths were readily obtained by tuning the thickness of
   an etching mask film. Analysis of the histogram of different devices
   yielded a single dominate peak in device parameter distribution,
   indicating excellent uniformity and high confidence of single nanowire
   operation. Using two vertical nanowire junctionless transistors, a
   PMOS-logic inverter with near rail-to-rail output voltage was
   demonstrated, and device matching in the logic can be conveniently
   obtained by controlling the number of nanowires employed in different
   devices rather than modifying device geometry. These studies show that
   junctionless transistors based on vertical Ge/Si core/shell nanowires
   can be fabricated in a controlled fashion with excellent performance and
   may be used in future hybrid, high-performance circuits where bottom-up
   grown nanowire devices with different functionalities can be directly
   integrated with an existing Si platform.}},

Abstract = {{Memristor, which had been predicted a long time ago (Chua, L. O. IEEE

   expected to open a new era for nonvolatile memory storage, neuromorphic

   breakthroughs were made for memristive phenomena and transistors with
   single-layer MoS2 (Sangwan, V. K.; et al. Nat. Nanotechnol. 2015, 10,

Abstract = {{The ability to tune the molecular interaction electronically can have
   profound impact on wide-ranging scientific frontiers in catalysis,
   chemical and biological sensor development, and the understanding of key
   biological processes. Despite that electrochemistry is routinely used to
   probe redox reactions involving loss or gain of electrons, electrical
   probing and tuning of the weaker noncovalent interactions, such as
   molecular physisorption, have been challenging, primarily due to the
   inability to change the work function of conventional metal electrodes.
   To this end, we report electrical probing and tuning of the noncovalent
   physisorption of polar molecules on graphene surface by using graphene
   nanoelectronic heterodyne sensors. Temperature-dependent molecular
   desorptions for six different polar molecules were measured in real-time
   to study the desorption kinetics and extract the binding affinities.
   More importantly, we demonstrate electrical tuning of molecule graphene
   binding kinetics through electrostatic gating of graphene; the molecular
   desorption can be slowed down nearly three times within a gate voltage
   range of 15 V. Our results provide insight into small molecule
   nanomaterial interaction dynamics and signify the ability to
   electrically tailor interactions, which can lead to rational designs of
   complex chemical processes for catalysis and drug discovery.}},

Abstract = {{Suppression of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of an elastically mounted
   circular cylinder in a steady flow is studied experimentally using
   localized surface roughness, called Passive Turbulence Control (PTC).
   PTC consists of two roughness strips with thickness on the order of the
   boundary layer thickness and placed parallel to the cylinder axis
   symmetrically with respect to the flow. The range of Reynolds number (3
   x 10(4) <= Re <= 1.2 x 10(5)) considered covers primarily the Transition
   to Shear Layer3, high-lift, flow regime. For the smooth cylinder, the
   broad synchronization range and higher peak amplitude in the upper
   branch and unstable oscillations in the lower branch are characteristic
   of VIV at higher Reynolds numbers and distinctive from those of lower
   Reynolds numbers. From the PTC-cylinder results with systematic
   variation of the PTC location, one strong-suppression zone and two
   weak-suppression zones are identified based on the location of the PTC.
   These zones are part of the Map that established the relation between
   PTC and Flow-Induced Motions in previous work. In the strong suppression
   zone, reduction of 30-80\% is achieved while in the weak suppression
   zones reduction of less than 30\% is achieved. Broad field-of-view flow
   visualization shows that smooth cylinder vortex structures change with
   PTC and between zones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Second best toll pricing within the framework of bounded rationality}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{74-90}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The network design problem is usually formulated as a bi-level program,
   assuming the user equilibrium is attained in the lower level program.
   Given boundedly rational route choice behavior, the lower-level program
   is replaced with the boundedly rational user equilibria (BRUE). The
   network design problem with boundedly rational route choice behavior is
   understudied due to non-uniqueness of the BRUE. In this study, thus, we
   mainly focus on boundedly rational toll pricing (BR-TP) with affine link
   cost functions. The topological properties of the lower level BRUE set
   are first explored. As the BRUE solution is generally non-unique, urban
   planners cannot predict exactly which equilibrium flow pattern the
   transportation network will operate after a planning strategy is
   implemented. Due to the risk caused by uncertainty of people's reaction,
   two extreme scenarios are considered: the traffic flow patterns with
   either the minimum system travel cost or the maximum, which is the
   ``risk-prone{''} (BR-TP-RP) or the ``risk-averse{''} (BR-TP-RA) scenario
   respectively. The upper level BR-TP is to find an optimal toll
   minimizing the total system travel cost, while the lower level is to
   find the best or the worst scenario. Accordingly BR-TP can be formulated
   as either a min -min or a min -max program. Solution existence is
   discussed based on the topological properties of the BRUE and algorithms
   are proposed. Two examples are accompanied to illustrate the proposed
   methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A conflict-based path-generation heuristic for evacuation planning}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{136-150}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Evacuation planning and scheduling is a critical aspect of disaster
   management and national security applications. This paper proposes a
   conflict-based path-generation approach for evacuation planning. Its key
   idea is to decompose the evacuation planning problem into a master and a
   subproblem. The subproblem generates new evacuation paths for each
   evacuated area, while the master problem optimizes the flow of evacuees
   and produce an evacuation plan. Each new path is generated to remedy
   conflicts in the evacuation flows and adds new columns and a new row in
   the master problem. The algorithm is applied to a set of large-scale
   evacuation scenarios ranging from the Hawkesbury-Nepean flood plain
   (West Sydney, Australia) which require evacuating in the order of 70,000
   persons, to the New Orleans metropolitan area and its 1,000,000
   residents. Experiments illustrate the scalability of the approach which
   is able to produce evacuation for scenarios with more than 1200 nodes,
   while a direct Mixed Integer Programming formulation becomes intractable
   for instances with more than 5 nodes. With this approach, realistic
   evacuations scenarios can be solved near-optimally in reasonable time,
   supporting both evacuation planning in strategic, tactical, and
   operational environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{61-68}},

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio ad hoc networks, the nodes exhibit autonomous
   behavior and selfishly search for the available channels to make
   spectrum selection decisions. A natural competition among cognitive
   users arises that may result is chaos and serious degradation in
   spectrum utilization. In this competitive and hostile environment, game
   theoretic model can ease this rivalry and autonomously assist in
   creating a subdued environment. We introduce a repeated game to
   alleviate the spectrum allocation problem and facilitate the cognitive
   radio users to make spectrum selection decision simultaneously or
   asynchronously. In contrast to sequential games, the proposed
   simultaneous move multi-stage game model is appropriate for practical
   applications where paucity of central spectrum management resources is
   common. In order to avoid the conflicts arising from coinciding
   concurrent decisions, we incorporate learning via history statistics to
   attain a stable and efficient equilibrium point. Every player computes
   the feasibility of playing a strategy from the action of the opponents
   in the previous iterations by incorporating the proposed learning rule.
   This learning process assists in decision making for the next iteration
   and the Nash equilibrium is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional, full core transport modeling with pin-resolved detail
   for reactor dynamic simulation is important for some multi-physics
   reactor applications. However, it can be computationally intensive due
   to the difficulty in maintaining accuracy while minimizing the number of
   time steps. A recently proposed Transient Multi-Level (TML) methodology
   overcomes this difficulty by use multi-level transient solvers to
   capture the physical phenomenal in different time domains and thus
   maximize the numerical accuracy and computational efficiency. One major
   problem with the TML method is the negative flux/precursor number
   density generated using large time steps for the MOC solver, which is
   due to the Backward Euler discretization scheme. In this paper, the
   stability issue of Backward Euler discretization is first investigated
   using the Point Kinetics Equations (PKEs), and the predicted maximum
   allowed time step for SPERT test 60 case is shown to be less than 10 ms.
   To overcome this difficulty, linear and exponential transformations are
   investigated using the PKEs. The linear transformation is shown to
   increase the maximum time step by a factor of 2, and the exponential
   transformation is shown to increase the maximum time step by a factor of
   5, as well as provide unconditionally stability above a specified
   threshold. The two sets of transformations are then applied to TML
   scheme in the MPACT code, and the numerical results presented show good
   agreement for standard, linear transformed, and exponential transformed
   maximum time step between the PKEs model and the MPACT whole core
   transport solution for three different cases, including a pin cell case,
   a 3D SPERT assembly case and a row of assemblies ({''}striped assembly
   case{''}) from the SPERT model. Finally, the successful whole transient
   execution of the stripe assembly case shows the ability of the
   exponential transformation method to use 10 ms and 20 ms time steps,
   which all failed using the standard method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The impact of the approximations in the ``two-steps{''} procedure used
   in the current generation of nodal simulators for core transient
   calculations is assessed by using a higher order solution obtained from
   a direct, whole core; transient transport calculation. A control rod

   uses the two-steps procedure and DeCART which provides the higher order
   solution. DeCART is used as lattice code to provide the homogenized
   cross sections and kinetics parameters to PARCS. The approximations made
   by using (1) the homogenized few-group cross sections and kinetic
   parameters generated at the assembly level, (2) an effective delayed
   neutrons fraction, (3) an effective fuel temperature and (4) the
   few-group formulation are investigated in terms of global and local core
   power behavior. The results presented in the paper show that the current
   two-steps procedure produces sufficiently accurate transient results
   with respect to the direct whole core calculation solution, provided
   that its parameters are carefully generated using the prescriptions

Abstract = {{The method of characteristics (MOC) neutron transport modeling
   requirements of very thin CRUD and burnable absorber layers on
   pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel rods are investigated. Ray tracing
   parameters, including spacing size and number of angles, and mesh
   refinement studies are performed for two-dimensional assembly
   simulations using the DeCART code. It is found that the presence of a 10
   mu m thick Integral Fuel Burnable Absorber (IFBA) layer within the
   lattice model requires a ray spacing that is approximately five times
   smaller than modeling a lattice without IFBA. The modeling of a CRUD
   layer necessitates less stringent requirements, due to the fact that the
   boron-10 concentration in a CRUD layer is at least one order of
   magnitude lower than what is typically found in IFBA layers. Three
   dimensional CRUD distributions and compositions computed by the CRUD
   chemistry code MAMBA are extracted and utilized. The reactivity effects
   of radial and azimuthal mesh refinement, including homogenization
   strategies of the CRUD layer with the coolant, are investigated.
   Additionally, the reactivity effect of including the CRUD structure
   porosity is discussed. A fresh fuel lattice with 1300 ppm is also
   compared with a reduced boron concentration of 0 ppm to assess the
   reactivity response of the system to changes in the reactor environment.

Abstract = {{Internal Model Control (IMC) has a great appeal for automotive
   powertrain control in reducing the control design and calibration
   effort. Motivated by its success in several automotive applications,
   this work investigates the design of nonlinear IMC for wastegate control
   of a turbocharged gasoline engine. The IMC design for linear
   time-invariant (LTI) systems is extended to nonlinear systems. To
   leverage the available tools for LTI IMC design, the quasi-linear
   parameter-varying (quasi-LPV) models are explored. IMC design through
   transfer function inverse of the quasi-LPV model is ruled out due to
   parameter variability. A new approach for nonlinear inversion, referred
   to as the structured quasi-LPV model inverse, is developed and
   validated. A fourth-order nonlinear model which sufficiently describes
   the dynamic behavior of the turbocharged engine is used as the design
   model in the IMC structure. The controller based on structured quasi-LPV
   model inverse is designed to achieve boost-pressure tracking. Finally,
   simulations on a validated high-fidelity model are carried out to show
   the feasibility of the proposed IMC. Its closed-loop performances are
   compared with a well-tuned PI controller with extensive feedforward and
   anti-windup built in. Robustness of the nonlinear IMC design is analyzed
   using simulations. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   {[}PhSiO1.5](10) via F- catalyzed rearrangement of {[}PhSiO1.5](n) n =

   rearrangement of all starting materials. The recovered starting
   materials can be re-equilibrated using catalytic F- to generate similar
   yields in second batches. These yields arise because {[}PhSiO1.5](10)
   exhibits higher solubility and better energy stabilization (10 kcal
   mol(-1) theory) in CH2Cl2 compared to {[}PhSiO1.5](8) or
   {[}PhSiO1.5](12). Reaction intermediates were identified using time
   dependent F-19 NMR and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry eventually
   equilibrating to form the 8 : 10 : 12 cages in a 1 : 3 : 1.3 equilibrium
   in CH2Cl2. Experimental results coupled with modeling using the Gamess

   of reaction for interconversion of the model intermediates
   {[}HSiO1.5](x) determined computationally, were used to select the most

   activation and cleavage of a T-8 cage corner by F- attachment, followed
   by the corners stepwise removal as {[}i. e. RSi(OH)(3)], followed
   thereafter by reinsertion forming {[}RSiO1.5](9)-OH followed by,
   insertion of another corner to form {[}RSiO1.5](10)-(OH)(2) and finally
   condensation to give {[}RSiO1.5](10). The most enthalpically favorable

   frequency (TOF) of 3.51 s(-1) at an overpotential of only 0.15 V vs. Pt.
   Trends in activity are further analyzed. It is found that (a) a decrease
   in overpotential correlates strongly with the electron withdrawing
   strength of the PNP amine substituent, and (b) aliphatic substituents
   give comparatively higher TOFs than aromatic ones. An EC-type mechanism
   is shown to proceed by initial reduction of the Fe-II metal center and
   proposed formation of an Fe-III hydride intermediate. Analogous cobalt

Abstract = {{Hydrogel scaffolds are used in tissue engineering as a delivery vehicle
   for regenerative growth factors. Spatiotemporal patterns of growth
   factor signaling are critical for tissue regeneration, yet most
   scaffolds afford limited control of growth factor release, especially
   after implantation. We previously found that acoustic droplet
   vaporization can control growth factor release from a fibrin scaffold
   doped with a perfluorocarbon emulsion. This study investigates
   properties of the acoustically responsive scaffold (ARS) critical for
   further translation. At 2.5 MHz, acoustic droplet vaporization and
   inertial cavitation thresholds ranged from 1.5 to 3.0 MPa and from 2.0
   to 7.0 MPa peak rarefactional pressure, respectively, for ARSs of
   varying composition. Viability of C3H/10T1/2 cells, encapsulated in the
   ARS, did not decrease significantly for pressures below 4 MPa. ARSs with
   perfluorohexane emulsions displayed higher stability versus those with
   perfluoropentane emulsions, while surrogate payload release was minimal
   without ultrasound. These results enable the selection of ARS
   compositions and acoustic parameters needed for optimized

Title = {{Endothelial sprouting and network formation in collagen- and

Abstract = {{A modular tissue engineering approach may have advantages over current
   therapies in providing rapid and sustained revascularization of ischemic
   tissue. In this study, modular protein microbeads were prepared from
   pure fibrin (FIB) and collagen-fibrin composites (COL-FIB) using a
   simple water-in-oil emulsification technique. Human endothelial cells
   and fibroblasts were embedded directly in the microbead matrix. The
   resulting microbeads were generally spheroidal with a diameter of
   100-200 mu m. Cell viability was high (75-80\% viable) in microbeads,
   but was marginally lower than in bulk hydrogels of corresponding
   composition (85-90\% viable). Cell proliferation was significantly
   greater in COL-FIB microbeads after two weeks in culture, compared to
   pure FIB microbeads. Upon embedding of microbeads in a surrounding
   fibrin hydrogel, endothelial cell networks formed inside the microbead
   matrix and extended into the surrounding matrix. The number of vessel
   segments, average segment length, and number of branch points was higher
   in FIB samples, compared to COL-FIB samples, resulting in significantly
   longer total vessel networks. Anastomosis of vessel networks from
   adjacent microbeads was also observed. These studies demonstrate that
   primitive vessel networks can be formed by modular protein microbeads
   containing embedded endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Such microbeads
   may find utility as prevascularized tissue modules that can be delivered
   minimally invasively as a therapy to restore blood flow to ischemic
   tissues.
   Statement of significance
   Vascularization is critically important for tissue engineering and
   regenerative medicine, and materials that support and/or promote
   neovascularization are of value both for translational applications and
   for mechanistic studies and discovery-based research. Therefore, we
   fabricated small modular microbeads formulated from pure fibrin (FIB)
   and collagen-fibrin (COL-FIB) containing endothelial cells and
   supportive fibroblasts. We explored how cells encapsulated within these
   materials form microvessel-like networks both within and outside of the
   microbeads when embedded in larger 3D matrices. FIB microbeads were
   found to initiate more extensive sprouting into the surrounding ECM in
   vitro. These results represent an important step towards our goal of
   developing injectable biomaterial modules containing preformed vascular
   units that can rapidly restore vascularization to an ischemic tissue in
   vivo. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Traffic injuries have become a major health-related issue to school-aged
   children. To study this type of injury with numerical simulations, a
   finite element model was developed to represent the full body of a
   10-year-old (YO) child. The model has been validated against test data
   at both body-part and full-body levels in previous studies. Representing
   only the average 10-YO child, this model did not include
   subject-specific attributes, such as the variations in size and shape
   among different children. In this paper, a new modeling approach was
   used to morph this baseline model to a subject-specific model, based on
   anthropometric data collected from pediatric subjects. This
   mesh-morphing method was then used to rapidly morph the baseline mesh
   into the subject-specific geometry while maintaining a good mesh
   quality. The morphed model was subsequently applied to simulate a
   real-world motor vehicle crash accident. A lung injury observed in the
   accident was well captured by the subject-specific model. The findings
   of this study demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed morphing
   approach to develop subject-specific human models, and confirm their
   capability in prediction of traffic injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are not easily
   treated, and many catheters (e.g., hemodialysis catheters) are not
   easily replaced. Biofilms (the source of infection) on catheter surfaces
   are notoriously difficult to eradicate. We have recently demonstrated
   that modest elevations of temperature lead to increased staphylococcal
   susceptibility to vancomycin and significantly soften the biofilm
   matrix. In this study, using a combination of microbiological,
   computational, and experimental studies, we demonstrate the efficacy,
   feasibility, and safety of using heat as an adjuvant treatment for
   infected hemodialysis catheters. Specifically, we show that treating
   with heat in the presence of antibiotics led to additive killing of
   Staphylococcus epidermidis with similar trends seen for Staphylococcus
   aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The magnitude of temperature elevation
   required is relatively modest (45-50 degrees C) and similar to that used
   as an adjuvant to traditional cancer therapy. Using a custom-designed
   benchtop model of a hemodialysis catheter, positioned with tip in the
   human vena cava as well as computational fluid dynamic simulations, we
   demonstrate that these temperature elevations are likely achievable in
   situ with minimal increased in overall blood temperature.}},

Abstract = {{In the current work, numerical simulations are used to evaluate the
   effects of detailed reaction chemistry of different primary reference
   fuel (PRF) blends of iso-octane and n-heptane on heat release in
   one-dimensional engine simulations. A simplified slider-crank model was
   used to represent the engine cycle. The contributions of specific
   reaction classes to ignition and heat release were quantified. Maps of
   ignition phasing and heat release were created as a function of pressure
   and temperature to indicate the change in reactivity (defined by the
   first and second stages of ignition) as a function of state conditions
   as well as the fraction of heat release associated with the two stages
   of ignition. For the conditions studied, the reactivity of the second
   stage of ignition always increased with increasing temperature, i.e. the
   phasing of autoignition advanced with increasing temperature, whereas
   the reactivity of the first stage of ignition exhibited negative
   temperature dependence where increasing temperature delayed the first
   stage of ignition and decreased the heat release at the first stage of
   ignition for some conditions. The results show low-temperature chemistry
   radicals like C-7 RO2 species are not uniquely indicative of
   low-temperature heat release, but they are formed at earlier times,
   higher rates and higher concentrations with PRF blends with higher
   fractions of n-heptane. A modified approach to the Livengood-Wu integral
   is presented to capture the integrated effects of the compression stroke
   on the potential for using the first stage of ignition to distribute
   heat release. The results of the modified ignition integral analysis are
   presented as a function of engine speed and fuel/air preheat temperature
   and demonstrate the utility of the approach to design and interpret
   fueling strategies of fuel blends. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Pace mapping (PM) is used to identify the origin of
   ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). For intramural VAs, the site of origin
   often cannot be reached and therefore PM is less accurate.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess the value of single-
   and dual-site pace maps to differentiate intramural from nonintramural
   VAs.
   METHODS In 18 consecutive patients with idiopathic intramural VAs, pace
   mapping was performed at 2 breakthrough sites in adjacent anatomic
   structures. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms of the 2 pace maps were
   averaged in MATLAB and compared (correlation coefficient {[}CC]) with
   the targeted VA. Dual-site pace mapping was performed in a control group
   of 18 patients with nonintramural VAs at the sites of earliest
   electrical activation and a breakthrough site in an adjacent anatomic
   location.
   RESULTS Dual-site pace maps had a higher CC than did best single-site
   pace maps (0.87 +/- 0.1 vs 0.81 +/- 0.16; P =.02) in patients with
   intramural VAs. At the site of origin, single-site pace maps had a
   higher CC than did dual-site pace maps obtained from adjacent anatomic
   locations (0.93 +/- 0.04 vs 0.89 +/- 0.05; P =.0004) in patients with
   nonintramural VAs. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
   and negative predictive value of dual-site pace maps for identifying an
   intramural VA were 89\%, 82\%, 84\%, 88\%, and 86\%, respectively.
   Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis
   revealed that a CC cutoff value of <= 0.86 for a single-site pace map
   best differentiated intramural from nonintramural VAs.
   CONCLUSION A higher CC value for a dual-site pace map obtained from the
   earliest breakthrough site as well as a CC cutoff value of <= 0.86 for a
   single-site pace map obtained from the site of earliest electrical
   activation can best differentiate intramural from nonintramural VAs.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) technology has drawn increasing amounts
   of attention in the last decade. As the world's largest automotive
   market, China has recently made the electrification of transportation
   central to its national strategic plan. Because of the unique nature of
   the vertically regulated power industry, China's massive deployment of
   PEVs has to face unique challenges that may not be encountered by any
   other country/region. Therefore, a comprehensive coordinated PEV
   charging scheme is urgently needed to facilitate the smooth grid
   integration of PEVs at all levels (e.g., transmission systems,
   distribution systems, and charging stations). This paper presents
   detailed mathematical modeling of a novel hierarchical framework for
   coordinated PEV charging at multiple timescales (i.e., day-ahead and
   real-time). The proposed three-level (e.g., provincial level, municipal
   level, and charging station level) PEV charging strategy jointly
   optimizes system load profile and charging costs while satisfying
   customer charging requirements. The interrelationships between various
   levels in terms of energy transaction and information exchange are
   clearly identified. Case studies on Guangdong Province, China, are
   carried out and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   proposed hierarchical control framework in reducing system peak demand
   and charging costs.}},

Journal = {{JOM}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Zn1-xCoxAl2O4 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) spinel
   nanoparticles were synthesized by a liquid-feed flame spray pyrolysis
   (LF-FSP) method by combusting metallorganic precursor solutions to
   produce nanopowders with precise composition control. The precursor
   solutions were aerosolized into a methane/ oxygen flame where it was
   combusted in an oxygen-rich environment to result in nanopowders at a
   single step. The nanopowders were analyzed by x-ray diffraction, Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, colorimetry, field emission scanning
   electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and BET
   (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) N-2 adsorption. Results show formation of
   spherical nanopowders with specific surface areas of 42 m(2)/g to 50
   m(2)/g, which correspond to average particle sizes of 26 nm to 31 nm.
   Single-phase materials were obtained with a high control of composition,
   which indicates that LF-FSP is an excellent method to produce
   mixed-metal oxides for applications in which powder homogeneity is
   crucial. The products were evaluated for ceramic pigment application,
   where the ratio of Zn to Co was gradually changed to observe the color
   change in the structure with the increase of cobalt concentration. The
   resulting pigments were calcined at 1200 degrees C, which aimed to
   identify the color stability after a high-temperature process, whereby
   the colors were measured using the color space CIE L{*}a{*}b{*} under
   standardized light, D65. Finally, the powders were tested for ceramic
   decoration using transparent glazes and ceramic bodies. The application
   was carried out at 1250 degrees C to evaluate the color performance
   after a decoration process.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorite (F)-pyrochlore (P)-fluorite (F) phase transitions of Gd2Zr2O7
   were investigated from 573 K to 1873 K (300 A degrees C to 1600 A

   Raman spectra. The low-temperature F phase can stably exist below 1523 K
   (1250 A degrees C) and the F-P transition occurs at 1523 K to 1573 K
   (1250 A degrees C to 1300 A degrees C). The ordering process of P phase
   forms at 1573 K to 1773 K (1300 A degrees C to 1500 A degrees C) and the
   ordering degree increases with increasing sintering temperature and heat
   preservation period. High-temperature phase transition from P to F
   occurs between 1773 K and 1823 K (1300 A degrees C and 1550 A degrees
   C). IR spectra of samples with different ordering degrees show an
   interesting shift at 510 cm(-1). Raman spectra show that only the A(1g)
   mode displays a significant change between F and P phases. This ordering
   degree and phase transition temperature studies would allow a more
   targeted experimental optimization of Gd2Zr2O7 to use in nuclear waste
   host, thermal barrier coatings, and solid oxide fuel cells. (C) The

Abstract = {{We describe first results from a micro-analytical subsystem that
   integrates a detector comprising a polymer-coated micro-optofluidic ring
   resonator (mu OFRR) chip with a microfabricated separation module
   capable of performing thermally modulated comprehensive two-dimensional
   gas chromatographic separations (mu GC x mu GC) of volatile organic
   compound (VOC) mixtures. The 2 x 2 cm mu OFRR chip consists of a hollow,
   contoured SiOx cylinder (250 mu m i.d.; 1.2 mu m wall thickness) grown
   from a Si substrate, and integrated optical and fluidic interconnection
   features. By coupling to a 1550 nm tunable laser and photodetector via
   an optical fiber taper, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonances were
   generated within the mu OFRR wall, and shifts in the WGM wavelength
   caused by transient sorption of eluting vapors into the PDMS film lining
   the mu OFRR cylinder were monitored. Isothermal separations of a simple
   alkane mixture using a PDMS coated 1st-dimension (1D) mu column and an
   OV-215-coated 2nd-dimension (2D) mu column confirmed that efficient mu
   GC x mu GC-mu OFRR analyses could be performed and that responses were
   dominated by film-swelling. Subsequent tests with more diverse VOC
   mixtures demonstrated that the modulated peak width and the VOC
   sensitivity were inversely proportional to the vapor pressure of the
   analyte. Modulated peaks as narrow as 120 ms and limits of detection in
   the low-ng range were achieved. Structured contour plots generated with
   the mu OFRR and a reference FID were comparable.}},

Title = {{Tolerance induction using nanoparticles bearing HY peptides in bone
   marrow transplantation}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Allogeneic cell therapies have either proven effective or have great
   potential in numerous applications, though the required systemic,
   life-long immunosuppression presents significant health risks. Inducing
   tolerance to allogeneic cells offers the potential to reduce or
   eliminate chronic immunosuppression. Herein, we investigated
   antigen-loaded nanoparticles for their ability to promote transplant
   tolerance in the minor histocompatibility antigen sex-mismatched C57BL/6
   model of bone marrow transplantation. In this model, the peptide
   antigens Dby and Uty mediate rejection of male bone marrow transplants
   by female CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, and we investigated the
   action of nanoparticles on these T cell subsets. Antigens were coupled
   to or encapsulated within poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) nanoparticles
   with an approximate diameter of 500 nm. Delivery of the CD4-encoded Dby
   epitope either coupled to or encapsulated within PLG particles prevented
   transplant rejection, promoted donor-host chimerism, and suppressed
   proliferative and IFN-gamma responses in tolerized recipients.
   Nanoparticles modified with the Uty peptide did not induce tolerance.
   The dosing regimen was investigated with Dby coupled particles, and a
   single dose delivered the day after bone marrow transplant was
   sufficient for tolerance induction. The engraftment of cells was
   significantly affected by PD-1/PDL-1 costimluation, as blockade of PD-1
   reduced engraftment by similar to 50\%. In contrast, blockade of
   regulatory T cells did not impact the level of chimerism. The delivery
   of antigen on PLG nanoparticles promoted long-term engraftment of bone
   marrow in a model with a minor antigen mismatch in the absence of
   immunosuppression, and this represents a promising platform for
   developing a translatable, donor-specific tolerance strategy. (c) 2015

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{701-722}},
Abstract = {{Silicon has been considered as one of the most promising anode material
   alternates for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, because of its
   high theoretical capacity, environmental friendliness, high safety, low
   cost, etc. Nevertheless, silicon-based anode materials (especially bulk
   silicon) suffer from severe capacity fading resulting from their low
   intrinsic electrical conductivity and great volume variation during
   lithiation/delithiation processes. To address this challenge, a few
   special constructions from nanostructures to anchored, flexible,
   sandwich, core-shell, porous and even integrated structures, have been
   well designed and fabricated to effectively improve the cycling
   performance of silicon-based anodes. In view of the fast development of
   silicon-based anode materials, we summarize their recent progress in
   structural design principles, preparation methods, morphological
   characteristics and electrochemical performance by highlighting the
   material structure. We also point out the associated problems and
   challenges faced by these anodes and introduce some feasible strategies
   to further boost their electrochemical performance. Furthermore, we give
   a few suggestions relating to the developing trends to better mature
   their practical applications in next-generation lithium-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-precision manufacturing (UPM) machines are used to fabricate and
   measure complex parts having micrometer-level features and
   nanometer-level tolerances/surface finishes. Therefore, random vibration
   of the machine due to ground excitations and residual vibration stemming
   from onboard disturbances must be mitigated using vibration isolation
   systems. A long-standing rule of thumb in vibration isolation system
   design is to locate the isolators in such a way that the vibration modes
   of the isolated machine are decoupled. However, prior work by the
   authors has demonstrated that coupling vibration modes of
   passively-isolated UPM machines could provide conditions for drastic
   reduction of residual vibrations compared to decoupling. The authors'
   analysis was based on the restrictive assumption that the isolated
   machine was modally damped. The key contribution of this paper is in
   investigating the effect of mode coupling on the residual vibrations of
   UPM machines with non-proportional (NP) damping which is more realistic
   than modal damping. It also analyzes the effects of mode coupling on the
   reduction of ground vibrations (i.e., transmissibility). The analyses
   reveal that, even though NP damping changes the vibration behavior of
   the machine compared to modal damping, mode coupling still provides
   ample opportunities to reduce residual vibration and transmissibility.
   Guidelines for properly designing a UPM machine to best exploit mode
   coupling for vibration reduction are provided and validated through
   simulations and experiments. Up to 40\% reduction in residual vibration
   and 50\% reduction in transmissibility are demonstrated. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a local and global function model in the liver based
   on regional and organ function measurements to support individualized
   adaptive radiation therapy (RT).
   Methods and Materials: A local and global model for liver function was
   developed to include both functional volume and the effect of functional
   variation of subunits. Adopting the assumption of parallel architecture
   in the liver, the global function was composed of a sum of local
   function probabilities of subunits, varying between 0 and 1. The model
   was fit to 59 datasets of liver regional and organ function measures
   from 23 patients obtained before, during, and 1 month after RT. The
   local function probabilities of subunits were modeled by a sigmoid
   function in relating to MRI-derived portal venous perfusion values. The
   global function was fitted to a logarithm of an indocyanine green
   retention rate at 15 minutes (an overall liver function measure).
   Cross-validation was performed by leave-m-out tests. The model was
   further evaluated by fitting to the data divided according to whether
   the patients had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or not.
   Results: The liver function model showed that (1) a perfusion value of
   68.6 mL/(100 g.min) yielded a local function probability of 0.5; (2) the
   probability reached 0.9 at a perfusion value of 98 mL/(100 g.min); and
   (3) at a probability of 0.03 {[}corresponding perfusion of 38 mL/(100
   g.min)] or lower, the contribution to global function was lost.
   Cross-validations showed that the model parameters were stable. The
   model fitted to the data from the patients with HCC indicated that the
   same amount of portal venous perfusion was translated into less local
   function probability than in the patients with non-HCC tumors.
   Conclusions: The developed liver function model could provide a means to
   better assess individual and regional dose-responses of hepatic
   functions, and provide guidance for individualized treatment planning of
   RT. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   System Design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{During the early stage design of large-scale engineering systems, design
   teams are challenged to balance a complex set of considerations. The
   established structured approaches for optimizing complex system designs
   offer strategies for achieving optimal solutions, but in practice
   suboptimal system-level results are often reached due to factors such as
   satisficing, ill-defined problems, or other project constraints. Twelve
   subsystem and system-level practitioners at a large aerospace
   organization were interviewed to understand the ways in which they
   integrate subsystems in their own work. Responses showed subsystem team
   members often presented conservative, worst-case scenarios to other
   subsystems when negotiating a tradeoff as a way of hedging against their
   own future needs. This practice of biased information passing, referred
   to informally by the practitioners as adding ``margins,{''} is modeled
   in this paper with a series of optimization simulations. Three
   ``bias{''} conditions were tested: no bias, a constant bias, and a bias
   which decreases with time. Results from the simulations show that biased
   information passing negatively affects both the number of iterations
   needed and the Pareto optimality of system-level solutions. Results are
   also compared to the interview responses and highlight several themes
   with respect to complex system design practice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a triangular shell heat transfer element that is

   This paper considers a 3-node linear element and a 6-node quadratic
   element. The element formulation is verified against a converged
   continuum heat transfer model for a thick steel plate exposed to a
   concentrated heat flux, a thick steel pipe exposed to a concentrated
   heat flux, and a concrete slab exposed to a localized fire. The
   verification studies demonstrate that the linear and quadratic elements
   consistently converge to the continuum model and require a fraction of
   the computational cost. The verification study involving the concrete
   slab exposed to a localized fire demonstrates that the formulation can
   readily handle steep temperature gradients as well as

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},

Abstract = {{Steel moment frame (MF) is one of the most prevalent and well researched
   steel seismic force resisting systems worldwide. However, efficiency and
   feasibility of using MF diminishes for large spans. In this paper, a
   recently developed steel seismic force resisting system, named
   buckling-restrained knee-braced truss moment frame (BRKBTMF), is
   suggested as a better alternative system. The BRKBTMF uses
   buckling-restrained knee-braces with open web trusses. In this paper, a
   four-story prototype office building was designed using both MF and
   BRKBTMF systems. Performance of the prototype building with different
   span lengths was systematically studied. The results show that BRKBTMF
   uses less structural steel, yet it performs better with lower structural
   damage, repair costs, and probability of collapse as compared with the
   MF for all span lengths and under all earthquake intensities considered.
   Hence, it is concluded that BRKBTMF is a viable and effective
   alternative seismic force resisting system for long-span applications.

Abstract = {{The combination of both very high brightness and deep blue emission from
   phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLED) is required for
   both display and lighting applications, yet so far has not been
   reported. A source of this difficulty is the absence of electron/exciton
   blocking layers (EBL) that are compatible with the high triplet energy
   of the deep blue dopant and the high frontier orbital energies of hosts
   needed to transport charge. Here, we show that N-heterocyclic carbene
   (NHC) Ir(III) complexes can serve as both deep blue emitters and
   efficient hole-conducting EBLs. The NHC EBLs enable very high brightness
   (>7,800 cd m(-2)) operation, while achieving deep blue emission with
   colour coordinates of {[}0.16, 0.09], suitable for most demanding
   display applications. We find that both the facial and the meridional
   isomers of the dopant have high efficiencies that arise from the unusual
   properties of the NHC ligand-that is, the complexes possess a strong
   metal-ligand bond that destabilizes the non-radiative metal-centred
   ligand-field states. Our results represent an advance in blue-emitting
   PHOLED architectures and materials combinations that meet the
   requirements of many critical illumination applications.}},

   battery}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{168-180}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Early detection of an internal short circuit (ISC) in lithium ion
   batteries has become a crucial task for battery management, as ISC is
   believed to be the root cause of several large format lithium ion
   battery fire accidents. In this paper, a scheme of on-line detection of
   ISC is proposed, and the online ISC detection problem is addressed from
   a model parameterization and parameter estimation perspective. Using a
   3D electrochemical-thermal-ISC coupled model, we explore the correlation
   between the measured voltage, current, and temperature data and the ISC
   status. It is identified that the abnormal depletion in the
   state-of-charge (SOC) and excessive heat generation associated with ISC
   affect the voltage and temperature responses, and that the correlation
   can be captured by a properly parameterized phenomenological model. The
   ISC detection is then recast as a parameter estimation problem, for
   which a model-based estimation algorithm is proposed and evaluated. It
   is shown that the estimation algorithm can track the parameter
   variations in real-time, thereby making it feasible to track ISC
   incubation status or to detect instantaneously triggered ISC. Moreover,
   it is observed that the recorded temperature profile is not affected by
   the location where the ISC occurs, due to the oval shape of the
   temperature distribution caused by anisotropic heat conduction of the
   battery core. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can detect the ISC,
   regardless of its physical location within the battery. (C) 2015

Title = {{Strain relaxation and resonance of carbon nanotube forests under
   electrostatic loading}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{250-258}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Electrostatic loading is widely used for sensing and actuation in
   miniaturized electromechanical systems, yet classical designs involve
   geometric patterning of solid materials such as silicon and metal films.
   Conductive nanoporous materials for electrostatics may enable
   engineering of new functionalities arising from their compliance,
   internal surface forces, and high surface area. Toward this end, we
   investigate the response of vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT)
   ``forests{''} to DC and AC electrostatic loads. First, the tensile
   strain-stress characteristics of patterned CNT forests was determined in
   a non-contact manner by cyclic DC electrostatic loading, revealing an
   increase of the effective Young's modulus with sequential load cycling.
   Next, we observed resonance can be excited by AC electrostatic loading,
   and that the resonance frequency increases with sequential sweeps of the
   AC load frequency. Both the DC and AC measurements indicate that
   residual stress that arises during CNT growth is relaxed upon
   electrostatic loading, causing stiffening of the structure. This study
   shows for the first time that CNT forests can function as bulk
   electrostatic elements, and their intrinsic low stiffness and quality
   factor may be suitable for development of wide bandwidth
   micro-resonators and adsorption-based sensors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Quantifying performance and effects of load carriage during a
   challenging balancing task using an array of wireless inertial sensors}},
Journal = {{GAIT \& POSTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{65-69}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We utilize an array of wireless inertial measurement units (IMUs) to
   measure the movements of subjects (n = 30) traversing an outdoor balance
   beam (zigzag and sloping) as quickly as possible both with and without
   load (20.5 kg). Our objectives are: (1) to use IMU array data to
   calculate metrics that quantify performance (speed and stability) and
   (2) to investigate the effects of load on performance. We hypothesize
   that added load significantly decreases subject speed yet results in
   increased stability of subject movements. We propose and evaluate five
   performance metrics: (1) time to cross beam (less time = more speed),
   (2) percentage of total time spent in double support (more double
   support time = more stable), (3) stride duration (longer stride duration
   = more stable), (4) ratio of sacrum M-L to A-P acceleration (lower ratio
   = less lateral balance corrections = more stable), and (5) M-L torso
   range of motion (smaller range of motion = less balance corrections =
   more stable). We find that the total time to cross the beam increases
   with load (t = 4.85, p < 0.001). Stability metrics also change
   significantly with load, all indicating increased stability. In
   particular, double support time increases (t = 6.04, p < 0.001), stride
   duration increases (t = 3.436, p = 0.002), the ratio of sacrum
   acceleration RMS decreases (t = -5.56, p < 0.001), and the M-L torso
   lean range of motion decreases (t = -2.82, p = 0.009). Overall, the IMU
   array successfully measures subject movement and gait parameters that
   reveal the trade-off between speed and stability in this highly dynamic
   balance task. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An efficient framework for the elasto-plastic reliability assessment of
   uncertain wind excited systems}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{69-78}},
Abstract = {{In this paper a method to efficiently evaluate the reliability of
   elastic-perfectly plastic structures is proposed. The method is based on
   combining dynamic shakedown theory with Subset Simulation. In
   particular, focus is on describing the shakedown behavior of uncertain
   elasto-plastic systems driven by stochastic wind loads. The ability of
   the structure to shakedown is assumed as a limit state separating
   plastic collapse from a safe, if not elastic, state of the structure.
   The limit state is therefore evaluated in terms of a probabilistic load
   multiplier estimated through solving a series of linear programming
   problems posed in terms of the responses of the underlying linear
   elastic model and self-stress distribution. The efficiency of the
   proposed procedure is guaranteed by the simplicity of the mathematical
   programming problem, the underlying structural model solved at each
   iteration, and die efficiency of Subset Simulation. The rigor of the
   approach is assured by the dynamic shakedown theory. The applicability
   of the framework is illustrated on a steel frame example. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper develops a numerical micromechanics fracture model based on

   inhomogeneities, such as fiber clustering and variations of the fiber
   coating thickness, on the stress-strain response and the crack
   development are investigated. Furthermore, FEM models of multi-layer
   cross-ply laminates are created including thousands of explicitly
   modeled fibers and fiber coatings. Crack density predictions are
   compared with well established analytical models by Laws and Dvorak
   {[}1] and Nairn {[}2]. An eight layer FEM model is used to predict
   damage propagation within each layer. The Numerical prediction of the

Abstract = {{Large efforts are currently being made toward improving internal
   combustion engine efficiency without degrading overall performance. To
   this end, advanced combustion strategies that require in-cylinder
   fuel/air mixtures to be prepared with unprecedented care and exactness
   are being implemented. Spray-guided stratified-charge operation is an
   example of one such strategy that offers high efficiency under
   light-load operation but requires precise fuel injector and combustion
   chamber design to ensure robust engine performance. Understanding the
   mixture formation processes aids in the success of such strategies and
   is therefore an important goal for internal combustion engine research.
   Direct visualization via optical diagnostics remains one of the most
   powerful tools for gaining insight into in-cylinder mixing processes,
   such as liquid fuel spray atomization. Although substantial efforts have
   been made over the last few decades to develop and implement liquid fuel
   spray diagnostics in the challenging in-cylinder environment, such
   techniques have been almost exclusively two-dimensional or too complex
   to be used regularly in design practices. Only now are practical,
   commercially available three-dimensional visualization technologies
   beginning to mature to a level for which they can be adapted to perform
   in-cylinder diagnostics. In this study, the three-dimensional fuel spray
   structure and its variations are visualized by a single plenoptic camera
   in an optically accessible spark-ignition direct-injection engine. The
   engine is operated under a variety of conditions relevant to
   conventional homogeneous-charge and spray-guided stratified-charge
   engine strategies. The spray and flow field interaction under different
   bulk flow conditions as well as engine speeds are clearly discernable in
   the instantaneous three-dimensional spray images, establishing the
   imaging technique as a viable and unique new tool for complex
   three-dimensional engine in-cylinder processes research.}},

Abstract = {{Ester hydrogenolysis is a key step in the production of alcohols and new
   catalysts are being sought to improve the performance and sustainability
   of this process. Research described in this paper investigated the use
   of Cu, Mo2C, and Mo2N-based catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of ethyl
   formate at 105-150 degrees C and 30 bar H-2. The high surface area
   Mo2C-based catalysts were more active and selective to methanol than the
   Mo2N-based catalysts. The deposition of nanoscale Cu and/or Pd particles
   onto the Mo2C or Mo2N resulted in significant enhancements in the
   methanol selectivities. The methanol selectivities varied with the
   acidity or basicity of the support suggesting some degree of cooperation
   between the Cu or Pd particles and the support. Temporal variations in
   rates for the Cu/Mo2C catalyst were consistent with first order kinetics
   with regard to ethyl formate and the activation energy was 44 kJ/mol.
   The best performance was achieved over a Pd-Cu/Mo2C catalyst; this
   material outperformed, by a significant margin, the oxide supported Cu
   catalysts. Given their high activities and selectivities, the Mo2C
   supported catalysts are attractive candidates for ester hydrogenolysis,
   including the intermediate step during the low temperature, cascade
   hydrogenation of CO and CO2 to methanol. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Supercritical water gasification of phenol using a Ru/CeO2 catalyst}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Phenols are typical aromatic pollutants and major byproducts of
   non-catalytic gasification and liquefaction processes. In this work,
   Ru/CeO2 was prepared and used to catalyze phenol gasification in
   supercritical water. The catalyst improves carbon efficiency by about
   90\% at the conditions employed: 0.5 g Ru/CeO2/g phenol catalyst loading
   at 550 degrees C with a water density of 0.0979 g/cm(3) and a 5 wt\%
   loading of phenol relative to water. This represents a more than 10-fold
   enhancement of carbon efficiency compared to the noncatalytic case, with
   CH4 as the major gaseous product. GC-MS results show suppressed
   formation of dimers, such as dibenzofuran and polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs), which may be caused by the hydrogenation activity
   of Ru/CeO2. Kinetic modeling of the gasification process gives an
   activation energy of 84.24 +/- 22 kJ/mol and an frequency factor (InA)
   of 12.5 +/- 2.9 for gaseous product formation, compared to 60 +/- 17
   kJ/mol and 7.53 +/- 2.7 for char formation. Ru/CeO2 is stable in
   supercritical water at temperatures up to 550 degrees C, suggesting that
   a Ru/CeO2 supercritical water gasification system may be a promising
   method for treating phenols. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Reducing airport gate blockage in passenger aviation: Models and
   analysis}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{189-199}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Commercial flights are typically assigned to an arrival gate at their
   destination station (airport) prior to their departure from their origin
   station. Although the gate is scheduled to be available when the flight
   arrives, this is not always the case in practice. Due to variability in
   departure and flight times, the arriving flight might arrive early, the
   previous flight departing from the gate might depart late, or both. When
   a flight arrives at its scheduled gate but has to wait because the
   preceding aircraft is still occupying that gate, we refer to this as
   gate blockage. Gate blockage can have many negative impacts, including
   passenger delays, missed connections, and increased fuel burn. Our
   research is focused on incorporating the inherent stochasticity of the
   system into the planning process to reduce the prevalence and impact of
   gate blockage. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to
   assign flights to gates so as to minimize the expected impact of gate
   blockage. We use historical data to predict delay distributions and
   conduct experiments to assess both the computational tractability of our
   approach and its potential for improvement in solution quality over
   existing approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The two-stage injection processes of three fatty acid esters, methyl

   with that of fossil diesel using a high-pressure diesel engine common
   rail injection system. The injection characteristics studied included
   injector inlet pressure characteristics, and rate and quantity of fuel
   mass injected per cycle. The effects of fuel properties and injection
   dwell time between the pilot and main injection events were also
   considered. Differences in the fuel properties of diesel and fatty acid
   esters caused modest changes in the main injection quantities and fuel
   pressure fluctuation characteristics after the end of injection, and the
   changes were affected by different injection pressures. The injection
   dwell time was also found to influence the injector inlet pressure
   characteristics at the start of the main injection event and thus the
   amount of fuel injected during main injection was slightly changed. (C)

Abstract = {{Flow Induced Motions (FIM) of a single, rigid, circular cylinder on
   end-springs are investigated for Reynolds number 30,000 < Re < 110,000.
   Passive Turbulence Control (FTC) in the form of roughness strips is
   applied to enhance FIM and increase the efficiency of the VIVACE (Vortex
   Induced Vibration for Aquatic Clean Energy) converter in harnessing
   marine hydrokinetic energy. Numerical simulations are performed using a
   solver for two-dimensional Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
   equations, which is developed based on OpenFOAM using a finite-volume
   discretization method. The results are in excellent agreement with
   experiments conducted in the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory (MRELab)
   at the University of Michigan. Amplitude and frequency are predicted
   correctly in the initial and upper VIV branches, in VIV-to-galloping
   transition, and in galloping. The 2S (S = Single) vortex pattern is
   observed in the initial VIV branch and the 2P + 2S (P = Pair) in the
   upper branch for 30,000 <= Re <= 80,000. Transition from VIV to
   galloping initiates at Re = 90,000 with a P + 2S + P + S pattern.
   Maximum amplitude of 3.5D (D = Diameters) is achieved and more than
   seven vortices per cycle are observed in fully developed galloping. With
   PTC, the VIVACE converter can harness hydrokinetic energy from currents
   or tides over the entire range of FIM synchronization. Energy conversion
   efficiency reaches 37\% in simulations and 28\% in experiments. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{High-performance microporous titania-silica (Tio(2)-SiO2) nanocomposites
   with different TiO2 loadings of 0-100 wt\% were synthesized using a
   sol-gel method and evaluated for ultra-deep oxidative desulfurization
   (ODS) of dibenzothiophene (DBT) using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as
   oxidant. The prepared catalysts were characterized by the N-2
   adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), high resolution transmission electron
   microscopy (HR-TEM) and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption
   (NH3-TPD), and the ODS performances were evaluated in a batch reactor.
   The effects of titanium loading, calcination temperature, and reaction
   temperature on the catalyst performance were examined. The activity
   varied significantly with the amount of titanium in the TiO2-SiO2
   nanocomposite with a nearly constant turnover frequency (TOF) of about
   24.6 h(-1). The TiO2-SiO2 nanocomposite containing 50 wt\% titania
   loading (TS-50) with the highest total acidity was an excellent catalyst
   capable of removing more than 98\% of DBT to less than 10 ppmw, after 20
   min. DBT was oxidized to DBT-sulfone (DBTO2), a species with higher
   polarity that could be subsequently adsorbed on the TS-50 and therefore,
   the nanocomposite acts as both a catalyst and adsorbent simultaneously.
   The catalysts could be easily regenerated by calcination at 873 K. An
   empirical kinetic model was employed to interpret the reaction rate
   data; the apparent activation energy was 43.8 kJ/mol. Density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations revealed that DBT and TBHP reactants and DBTO2
   product were more strongly adsorbed on (001) surface of
   beta-cristobalite silica than on (101) surface of anatase titania. The
   adsorption energy of DBTO2 was larger than DBT on both surfaces. (C)

Title = {{Effects of alumina phases as nickel supports on deep reactive adsorption
   of (4,6-dimethyl) dibenzothiophene: Comparison between gamma, delta, and
   theta-alumina}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{gamma-, delta-, and theta-phases of alumina were prepared by treating
   high purity boehmite at 873, 1173, and 1273 K, respectively, in air for
   6 h. Alumina-supported nickel adsorbents were then prepared by
   ultrasonic-aided incipient wetness impregnation of Ni(NO3)(2) over the
   three alumina phases with the same nickel loading per nm(support)(2) .
   The samples were characterized by ICP-AES, XRD, FTIR, N-2
   adsorption-desorption, NH3-TPD, H-2-TPR, SEM, and HR-TEM. The specific
   performances of alumina supports and the adsorbents containing nickel
   were evaluated for reactive adsorption desulfurization (RADS) of
   dibenzothiophene (DBT) and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) at
   473 K and atmospheric pressure. It was found that physicochemical
   properties of the alumina supports affected the dispersion and
   reducibility of nickel and thus, the specific RADS performance of the
   adsorbents, which followed the order of Ni/theta-alumina similar to
   Ni/delta-alumina>Ni/gamma-alumina. However, the nickel adsorbents
   exhibited nearly constant turnover frequencies (TOF) of about 112 and 89
   h(-1) for RADS of DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, respectively. Furthermore, a
   coupled TPO-FTIR analysis of the spent adsorbent revealed that sulfur
   and coke were present on the surface of nickel adsorbent which were
   considered to be the major sources of the adsorbents deactivation. (C)

Abstract = {{Wireless sensors operating in harsh environments have the potential to
   be error-prone. This paper presents a distributive model-based diagnosis
   algorithm that identifies non-linear sensor faults. The diagnosis
   algorithm has advantages over existing fault diagnosis methods such as
   centralized model-based and distributive model-free methods. An
   algorithm is presented for detecting common non-linearity faults without
   using reference sensors. The study introduces a model-based fault
   diagnosis framework that is implemented within a pair of wireless
   sensors. The detection of sensor nonlinearities is shown to be
   equivalent to solving the largest empty rectangle (LER) problem, given a
   set of features extracted from an analysis of sensor outputs. A
   low-complexity algorithm that gives an approximate solution to the LER
   problem is proposed for embedment in resource constrained wireless
   sensors. By solving the LER problem, sensors corrupted by non-linearity
   faults can be isolated and identified. Extensive analysis evaluates the
   performance of the proposed algorithm through simulation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{It remains a challenge to develop electroactive and elastic biomaterials
   to mimic the elasticity of soft tissue and to regulate the cell behavior
   during tissue regeneration. We designed and synthesized a series of
   novel electroactive and biodegradable polyurethane-urea (PUU) copolymers
   with elastomeric property by combining the properties of polyurethanes
   and conducting polymers. The electroactive PUU copolymers were
   synthesized from amine capped aniline trimer (ACAT), dimethylol
   propionic acid (DMPA), polylactide, and hexamethylene diisocyanate. The
   electroactivity of the PUU copolymers were studied by UV-vis
   spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Elasticity and Young's modulus were
   tailored by the polylactide segment length and ACAT content.
   Hydrophilicity of the copolymer films was tuned by changing DMPA content
   and doping of the copolymer. Cytotoxicity of the PUU copolymers was
   evaluated by mouse C2C12 myoblast cells. The myogenic differentiation of
   C2C12 myoblasts on copolymer films was also studied by analyzing the
   morphology of myotubes and relative gene expression during myogenic
   differentiation. The chemical structure, thermal properties, surface
   morphology, and processability of the PUU copolymers were characterized
   by NMR, FT-IR, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric
   analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), and solubility testing, respectively. Those
   biodegradable electroactive elastic PUU copolymers are promising
   materials for repair of soft tissues such as skeletal muscle, cardiac
   muscle, and nerve.}},

   structures with sizes determined by the respective precursor
   functionalities. Owing to their monomer diversity and synthetic
   accessibility, sequence-specific oligopeptoids bearing dynamic covalent
   pendant groups were employed as precursors for molecular ladder
   fabrication. The generated structures were characterized using
   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and gel

Abstract = {{Cement stabilization of arsenic-bearing wastes is recommended to limit
   arsenic release from wastes following disposal. Such stabilization has
   been demonstrated to reduce the arsenic concentration in the Toxicity
   Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), which regulates landfill
   disposal of arsenic waste. However, few studies have evaluated leaching
   from actual wastes under conditions similar to ultimate disposal
   environments. In this study, land disposal in areas where flooding is
   likely was simulated to test arsenic release from cement stabilized
   arsenic-bearing iron oxide wastes. After 406 days submersed in
   chemically simulated rainwater, <0.4\% of total arsenic was leached,
   which was comparable to the amount leached during the TCLP (<0.3\%).
   Short-term (18 h) modified TCLP tests (pH 3-12) found that cement
   stabilization lowered arsenic leaching at high pH, but increased
   leaching at pH <4.2 compared to non-stabilized wastes. Presenting the
   first characterization of cement stabilized waste using mu XRF, these
   results revealed the majority of arsenic in cement stabilized waste
   remained associated with iron. This distribution of arsenic differed
   from previous observations of calcium-arsenic solid phases when arsenic
   salts were stabilized with cement, illustrating that the initial waste
   form influences the stabilized form. Overall, cement stabilization is
   effective for arsenic-bearing wastes when acidic conditions can be
   avoided. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) is a kind of High Performance
   Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC) with a low fiber
   volume content of 2\%. The unique properties of tensile strain hardening
   behavior and tight multiple cracks ensure that ECC can meet the
   stringent requirements of resiliency and durability of concrete
   infrastructures. While there are strong initiatives for the adoption of
   ECC in China, wider applications will require localization of material
   ingredients. In this paper, ECCs with local ingredients, including
   domestic PVA fibers, fly ash and crumb rubber, were developed under the
   guidance of micromechanics model for ECC. The fiber/matrix interface
   parameters and matrix parameters from single fiber pullout test and
   fracture toughness test respectively, were obtained for the tailoring of
   domestic ECC. The experimental results indicated that cost-effective
   ductile ECCs can be designed successfully using local material
   ingredients. These composites show an ultimate tensile strength of 4-5
   MPa and tensile strain capacity of 3-6\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Simultaneous distribution between the deflection angle and the lateral
   displacement of fast charged particles traversing through matter is
   derived by applying numerical inverse Fourier transforms on the Fourier
   spectral density solved analytically under the Moliere theory of
   multiple scattering, taking account of ionization loss. Our results show
   the simultaneous Gaussian distribution at the region of both small
   deflection angle and lateral displacement, though they show the
   characteristic contour patterns of probability density specific to the
   single and the double scatterings at the regions of large deflection
   angle and/or lateral displacement. The influences of ionization loss on
   the distribution are also investigated. An exact simultaneous
   distribution is derived under the fixed energy condition based on a
   well-known model of screened single scattering, which indicates the
   limit of validity of the Moliere theory applied to the simultaneous
   distribution. The simultaneous distribution will be valuable for
   improving the accuracy and the efficiency of experimental analyses and
   simulation studies relating to charged particle transports.}},

Abstract = {{Published estimates of methane emissions from atmospheric data (top-down
   approaches) exceed those from source-based inventories (bottom-up
   approaches), leading to conflicting claims about the climate
   implications of fuel switching from coal or petroleum to natural gas.
   Based on data from a coordinated campaign in the Barnett Shale oil and
   gas-producing region of Texas, we find that top-down and bottom-up
   estimates of both total and fossil methane emissions agree within
   statistical confidence intervals (relative differences are 10\% for
   fossil methane and 0.1\% for total methane). We reduced uncertainty in
   top-down estimates by using repeated mass balance measurements, as well
   as ethane as a fingerprint for source attribution. Similarly, our
   bottom-up estimate incorporates a more complete count of facilities than
   past inventories, which omitted a significant number of major sources,
   and more effectively accounts for the influence of large emission
   sources using a statistical estimator that integrates observations from
   multiple ground-based measurement datasets. Two percent of oil and gas
   facilities in the Barnett accounts for half of methane emissions at any
   given time, and high-emitting facilities appear to be spatiotemporally
   variable. Measured oil and gas methane emissions are 90\% larger than
   estimates based on the US Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse
   Gas Inventory and correspond to 1.5\% of natural gas production. This
   rate of methane loss increases the 20-y climate impacts of natural gas
   consumed in the region by roughly 50\%.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPHOTONICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{The spectrum filtering behavior of the slit nanoresonator array
   structure is based on the coupling between the slit resonance and the
   Wood's anomaly of grating array, and therefore has angle dependence,
   which is not desirable for some applications. To achieve an
   angle-insensitive spectrum filter, such a coupling should be disrupted.
   We show that reducing the period of the slit array helps decouple these
   two resonances. Additionally, by enhancing the light confinement inside
   the slits through either shrinking the slit width or filling the slits
   with a high-index medium, a narrow transmission peak is maintained at a
   small period so that an angle-insensitive spectrum filter is achieved.

Title = {{Comparative analyses of plasma probe diagnostics techniques}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{The subject of this paper is a comparative analysis of the plasma
   parameters inferred from the classical Langmuir probe procedure, from
   different theories of the ion current to the probe, and from measured
   electron energy distribution function (EEDF) obtained by double
   differentiation of the probe characteristic. We concluded that the
   plasma parameters inferred from the classical Langmuir procedure can be
   subjected to significant inaccuracy due to the non-Maxwellian EEDF,
   uncertainty of locating the plasma potential, and the arbitrariness of
   the ion current approximation. The plasma densities derived from the ion
   part of the probe characteristics diverge by as much as an order of
   magnitude from the density calculated according to Langmuir procedure or
   calculated as corresponding integral of the measured EEDF. The electron
   temperature extracted from the ion part is always subjected to
   uncertainty. Such inaccuracy is attributed to modification of the EEDF
   for fast electrons due to inelastic electron collisions, and to
   deficiencies in the existing ion current theories; i.e., unrealistic
   assumptions about Maxwellian EEDFs, underestimation of the ion
   collisions and the ion ambipolar drift, and discounting deformation of
   the one-dimensional structure of the region perturbed by the probe. We
   concluded that EEDF measurement is the single reliable probe diagnostics
   for the basic research and industrial applications of highly
   non-equilibrium gas discharge plasmas. Examples of EEDF measurements
   point up importance of examining the probe current derivatives in real
   time and reiterate significance of the equipment technical
   characteristics, such as high energy resolution and wide dynamic range.

   the aluminum reduction cells. Another type is new. It is related to the
   destabilizing effect of the Lorentz force formed by the azimuthal

Abstract = {{As anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions acidify the oceans,
   calcifiers generally are expected to be negatively affected. However,
   using data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder, we show that
   coccolithophore occurrence in the North Atlantic increased from similar
   to 2 to more than 20\% from 1965 through 2010. We used random forest
   models to examine more than 20 possible environmental drivers of this
   change, finding that CO2 and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation were
   the best predictors, leading us to hypothesize that higher CO2 levels
   might be encouraging growth. A compilation of 41 independent laboratory
   studies supports our hypothesis. Our study shows a long-term basin-scale
   increase in coccolithophores and suggests that increasing CO2 and
   temperature have accelerated the growth of a phytoplankton group that is
   important for carbon cycling.}},

Abstract = {{Radiative transfer of energy at the nanometre length scale is of great
   importance to a variety of technologies including heat-assisted magnetic
   recording(1), near-field thermophotovoltaics(2) and lithography(3).
   Although experimental advances have enabled elucidation of near-field
   radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as 20-30 nanometres (refs 4-6),
   quantitative analysis in the extreme near field (less than 10
   nanometres) has been greatly limited by experimental challenges.
   Moreover, the results of pioneering measurements(7,8) differed from
   theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. Here we use
   custom-fabricated scanning probes with embedded thermocouples(9,10), in
   conjunction with new microdevices capable of periodic temperature
   modulation, to measure radiative heat transfer down to gaps as small as
   two nanometres. For our experiments we deposited suitably chosen metal
   or dielectric layers on the scanning probes and microdevices, enabling
   direct study of extreme near-field radiation between silica-silica,
   silicon nitride-silicon nitride and gold-gold surfaces to reveal marked,
   gap-size-dependent enhancements of radiative heat transfer. Furthermore,
   our state-of-the-art calculations of radiative heat transfer, performed
   within the theoretical framework of fluctuational electrodynamics, are
   in excellent agreement with our experimental results, providing
   unambiguous evidence that confirms the validity of this theory(11-13)
   for modelling radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as a few
   nanometres. This work lays the foundations required for the rational
   design of novel technologies that leverage nanoscale radiative heat
   transfer.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents wavelength configurable on-chip solid-state ring
   lasers fabricated by a single-mask standard lithography. The single-and
   coupled-ring resonator hosts were fabricated on a fused-silica wafer and
   filled with 3,3'-Diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide (CY3), Rhodamine 6G
   (R6G), and 3,3'-Diethylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (CY5)-doped polymer as
   the reconfigurable gain media. The recorded lasing threshold was similar
   to 220 nJ/mm(2) per pulse for the single-ring resonator laser with R6G,
   marking the lowest threshold shown by solid-state dye-doped polymer
   lasers fabricated with a standard lithography process on a chip. A
   single-mode lasing from a coupled-ring resonator system with the lasing
   threshold of similar to 360 nJ/mm(2) per pulse was also demonstrated
   through the Vernier effect. The renewability of the dye-doped polymer
   was examined by removing and redepositing the dye-doped polymer on the
   same resonator hosts for multiple cycles. We recorded consistent
   emissions from the devices for all trials, suggesting the feasibility of
   employing this technology for numerous photonic and biochemical sensing
   applications that entail for sustainable, reconfigurable, and low lasing
   threshold coherent light sources on a chip.}},

Title = {{Long-term effects of multiply pulsed dielectric barrier discharges in
   air on thin water layers over tissue: stationary and random streamers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Tissue covered by thin liquid layers treated by atmospheric pressure
   plasmas for biomedical applications ultimately requires a reproducible
   protocol for human healthcare. The desired outcomes of wet tissue
   treatment by dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) depend on the plasma
   dose which determines the integral fluence of radicals, ions, electric
   fields and UV/VUV photons incident onto the tissue. These fluences are
   controlled by power, frequency and treatment time. To first order, these
   parameters determine the energy deposition (J cm(-2)) onto the tissue.
   However, energy deposition may not be the only parameter that determines
   the fluences of reactants to the underlying tissue. In this paper, we
   report on a computational investigation of multipulse DBDs interacting
   with wet tissue. The DBDs were simulated for 100 pulses at different
   repetition rates and liquid thicknesses followed by 10 s or more of
   afterglow. Two schemes were investigated-stationary and random. In the
   stationary scheme, the DBD plasma streamer continues to strike at the
   same location on the liquid layer, whereas in the random scheme the
   plasma streamer strikes at random locations on the liquid layer. These
   differences in streamer locations strongly affect the spatial
   distribution of solvated species such as OHaq and H2O2aq ('aq'
   represents an aqueous species), which have high rates of solvation. The
   spatial distribution of species such as NOaq, which have low rates of
   solvation, are less affected by the location of the streamer due to the
   remediating effects of diffusion in the air. The end result is that
   fluences to the tissue are sensitive to the spatial location of the
   streamer due to the ensuing reactions in the liquid between species that
   have low and high rates of solvation. These reactions can be controlled
   not only through location of the streamer, but also by repetition rate
   and thickness of the liquid layer.}},

Abstract = {{Anew ``2D/1D{''} equation is proposed to approximate the 3D linear
   Boltzmann equation. The approximate 2D/1D equation preserves the exact
   transport physics in the radial directions x and y but employs diffusion
   physics in the axial direction z. The 2D/1D equation can be
   systematically discretized, yielding accurate simulation methods for 3D
   reactor core problems. The resulting 2D/1D solutions are more accurate
   than 3D diffusion solutions, and are less expensive to calculate than
   standard 3D transport solutions. In this paper, we (i) show that the
   simplest 2D/1D equation has certain desirable properties, (ii)
   systematically discretize this equation, (iii) derive stable iteration
   schemes for solving the discrete system of equations, and (iv) give
   numerical results for simple problems that confirm the theoretical
   predictions of accuracy and iterative stability. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{A modified Monte Carlo ``Local Importance Function Transform{''} method}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{295}},
Pages = {{625-631}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The Local Importance Function Transform (LIFT) method uses an
   approximation of the contributon transport problem to bias a forward
   Monte-Carlo (MC) source-detector simulation (Turner, 1996; Turner and
   Larsen, 1997a,b). Local (cell-based) biasing parameters are calculated
   from an inexpensive deterministic adjoint solution and used to modify
   the physics of the forward transport simulation. In this paper, we
   develop a new expression for the LIFT biasing parameter, which depends
   on a cell-average adjoint current-to-scalar flux (J{*}/phi{*}) ratio.
   This biasing parameter differs significantly from the original
   expression, which uses adjoint cell-edge scalar fluxes to construct a
   finite difference estimate of the flux derivative; the resulting
   (original LIFT) biasing parameters exhibit spikes in magnitude at
   material discontinuities, causing the method to lose efficiency in
   problems with high spatial heterogeneity. The new J{*}/phi{*}
   expression, while more expensive to obtain, generates biasing parameters
   that vary smoothly across the spatial domain. The result is an
   improvement in simulation efficiency. A representative test problem has
   been developed and analyzed to demonstrate the advantage of the updated
   biasing parameter expression with regards to solution figure of merit
   (FOM). For reference, the two variants of the LIFT method are compared
   to a similar variance reduction method developed by Depinay (1997) and
   Depinay et al. (2006), as well as MC with deterministic adjoint weight
   windows (WW). (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from diesel passenger cars
   during real-world driving is one of the major technical challenges
   facing diesel auto manufacturers. Three main technologies are available
   for this purpose: exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), lean-burn NOx traps
   (LNT), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Seventy-three Euro 6
   diesel passenger cars (8 EGR only, 40 LNT, and 25 SCR) were tested on a
   chassis dynamometer over both the European type-approval cycle (NEDC,
   cold engine start) and the more realistic Worldwide harmonized
   light-duty test cycle (WLTC version 2.0, hot start) between 2012 and
   2015. Most vehicles met the legislative limit of 0.08 g/km of NOx over
   NEDC (average emission factors by technology: EGR-only 0.07 g/km, LNT
   0.04 g/km, and SCR 0.05 g/km), but the average emission factors rose
   dramatically over WLTC (EGR-only 0.17 g/km, LNT 0.21 g/km, and SCR 0.13
   g/km). Five LNT-equipped vehicles exhibited very poor performance over
   the WLTC, emitting 7-15 times the regulated limit. These results
   illustrate how diesel NOx emissions are not properly controlled under
   the current, NEDC-based homologation framework. The upcoming
   real-driving emissions (RDE) regulation, which mandates an additional
   on-road emissions test for EU type approvals, could be a step in the
   right direction to address this problem.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are conducted to examine lattice defect
   formation in a hexagonal boron nitride lattice by high-energy xenon ion
   impact. This work seeks to characterize the production of defects which
   occur under ion irradiation. Lattice defect formation is first examined
   in single-layer hexagonal boron nitride. Energetic xenon ions over a
   range of 10 eV-10 keV are used to randomly impact the central lattice at
   an angle of 90 degrees (orthogonal to the lattice basal plane). The
   resulting defects are analyzed for 5000 ion impacts, and results are
   reported for average single and double vacancy formation per impact. A
   similar study is conducted for a many-layer hexagonal boron nitride
   lattice, to assess the influence of additional layers in the formation
   of point defects as a function of incident ion energy. Ion impacts at
   both 900 and 45 are examined. The defects formed in the top layer of the
   many-layer lattice are qualitatively similar to the single layer
   results, but the presence of the bulk lattice is found to reduce the
   single vacancy probability in the top-most layer. Point defects are
   prominent in the lattice sub-layers with increasing ion energy.
   Orthogonal ion impacts are found to cause the most damage, as measured
   by the number of vacancy defects produced; the number of vacancies
   increases linearly with energy, while the number of defects in the
   oblique impact configuration reaches an asymptotic limit with increasing
   energy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Whether human cancer follows a hierarchical or stochastic model of
   differentiation is controversial. Furthermore, the factors that regulate
   cancer stem-like cell (CSC) differentiation potential are largely
   unknown. We used a novel microfluidic single-cell culture method to
   directly observe the differentiation capacity of four heterogeneous
   ovarian cancer cell populations defined by the expression of the CSC
   markers aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and CD133(+/-). We evaluated 3,692
   progeny from 2,833 cells. We found that only ALDH(+)CD133(+) cells could
   generate all four ALDH(+/-) CD133(+/-) cell populations and identified a
   clear branched differentiation hierarchy. We also observed a single
   putative stochastic event Within the hierarchy of cells, bone
   morphologenetic protein 2 (BMP2) is preferentially expressed in
   ALDH(-)CD133(-) cells. BMP2 promotes ALDH(+)CD133(+) cell expansion
   while suppressing the proliferation of ALDH(-)CD133(-) cells. As such,
   BMP2 suppressed bulk cancer cell growth in vitro but increased tumor
   initiation rates, tumor growth, and chemotherapy resistance in vivo
   whereas BMP2 knockdown reduced CSC numbers, in vivo growth, and
   chemoresistance. These data suggest a hierarchical differentiation
   pattern in which BMP2 acts as a feedback mechanism promoting ovarian CSC
   expansion and suppressing progenitor proliferation. These results
   explain why BMP2 suppresses growth in vitro and promotes growth in vivo.
   Together, our results support BMP2 as a therapeutic target in ovarian
   cancer.}},

Title = {{Use of explosives to investigate liquefaction resistance of aged sand
   deposits}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{199}},
Pages = {{140-147}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Current methods of predicting liquefaction potential were largely
   developed using data from relatively young deposits or deposits that
   have been frequently disturbed (i.e., areas of high seismicity). While
   engineers recognize that these prediction methods are overly
   conservative for assessing liquefaction potential in geologically aged
   deposits, there is no widely accepted method for quantitatively
   accounting for age in these assessments. Because a major disturbance,
   such as an earthquake or explosion that causes liquefaction, resets a
   deposit's ``geological age,{''} data from explosive compaction projects
   in aged deposits are used herein to provide information about both the
   aged and fresh deposits. A recent explosive compaction project performed
   in Griffin, IN, as well as four other explosive compaction projects, is
   used to develop an aging correction relationship for liquefaction
   resistance. Using a log-linear trend frequently proposed in previous
   studies, the method proposed herein predicts an approximate 20\% gain in
   liquefaction resistance per time log cycle. The proposed relationship
   can be used directly if the time since deposition or last disturbance is
   known or in conjunction with the measured-to-estimated-velocity-ratio
   (MEVR) relationship proposed by Andrus et al. if the deposit's age is
   unknown. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering is often referred to as a three-pronged discipline,

   Herein we focus on reviewing advances in controlled release of drugs
   from tissue engineering platforms. This review addresses advances in
   hydrogels and porous scaffolds that are synthesized from natural
   materials and synthetic polymers for the purposes of controlled release
   in tissue engineering. We pay special attention to efforts to reduce the
   burst release effect and to provide sustained and long-term release.
   Finally, novel approaches to controlled release are described, including
   devices that allow for pulsatile and sequential delivery. In addition to
   recent advances, limitations of current approaches and areas of further
   research are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Controlled release strategies for modulating immune responses to promote
   tissue regeneration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{219}},
Pages = {{155-166}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Advances in the field of tissue engineering have enhanced the potential
   of regenerative medicine, yet the efficacy of these strategies remains
   incomplete, and is limited by the innate and adaptive immune responses.
   The immune response associated with injury or disease combined with that
   mounted to biomaterials, transplanted cells, proteins, and gene
   therapies vectors can contribute to the inability to fully restore
   tissue function. Blocking immune responses such as with
   anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive agents are either ineffective, as
   the immune response contributes significantly to regeneration, or have
   significant side effects. This review describes targeted strategies to
   modulate the immune response in order to limit tissue damage following
   injury, promote an anti-inflammatory environment that leads to
   regeneration, and induce antigen (Ag)-specific tolerance that can target
   degenerative diseases that destroy tissues and promote engraftment of
   transplanted cells. Focusing on targeted immuno-modulation, we describe
   local delivery techniques to sites of inflammation as well as systemic
   approaches that preferentially target subsets of immune populations. (C)

Abstract = {{The bronze polymorph of titanium dioxide, known as TiO2(B), has
   promising photochemical and electronic properties for potential
   applications in Li-ion batteries, photocatalysis, chemical sensing, and
   solar cells. In contrast to previous studies performed with powder
   samples, which often suffer from impurities and lattice water, here we
   report Raman spectra from highly crystalline TiO2(B) films epitaxially
   grown on Si substrates with a thin SrTiO3 buffer layer. The reduced
   background from the Si substrate significantly benefits acquisition of
   polarization-dependent Raman spectra collected from the high-quality
   thin films, which are compared to nano-powder results reported in the
   literature. The experimental spectra were compared with density
   functional theory calculations to analyze the atomic displacements
   associated with each Raman-active vibrational mode. These results
   provide a standard reference for further investigation of the
   crystallinity, structure, composition, and properties of TiO2(B)
   materials with Raman spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that dissociated human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are
   intrinsically programmed to form lumens. PSCs form two-cell cysts with a
   shared apical domain within 20 hr of plating; these cysts collapse to
   form monolayers after 5 days. Expression of pluripotency markers is
   maintained throughout this time. In two-cell cysts, an apical domain,
   marked by EZRIN and atypical PKCz, is surrounded by apically targeted
   organelles (early endosomes and Golgi). Molecularly, actin
   polymerization, regulated by ARP2/3 and mammalian diaphanous-related
   formin 1 (MDIA), promotes lumen formation, whereas actin contraction,
   mediated by MYOSIN-II, inhibits this process. Finally, we show that
   lumenal shape can be manipulated in bioengineered micro-wells. Since
   lumen formation is an indispensable step in early mammalian development,
   this system can provide a powerful model for investigation of this
   process in a controlled environment. Overall, our data establish that
   lumenogenesis is a fundamental cell biological property of human PSCs.}},

Abstract = {{Wafer-scale CMOS active pixel sensors (APSs) have been developed
   recently for x-ray imaging applications. The small pixel pitch and low
   noise are very promising properties for medical imaging applications
   such as digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). In this work, we evaluated
   experimentally and through modeling the imaging properties of a 50 mu m
   pixel pitch CMOS APS x-ray detector named DynAMITe (Dynamic Range
   Adjustable for Medical Imaging Technology). A modified cascaded system
   model was developed for CMOS APS x-ray detectors by taking into account
   the device nonlinear signal and noise properties. The imaging properties
   such as modulation transfer function (MTF), noise power spectrum (NPS),
   and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) were extracted from both
   measurements and the nonlinear cascaded system analysis. The results
   show that the DynAMITe x-ray detector achieves a high spatial resolution
   of 10 mm(-1) and a DQE of around 0.5 at spatial frequencies <1 mm(-1).
   In addition, the modeling results were used to calculate the image
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNRi) of microcalcifications at various mean
   glandular dose (MGD). For an average breast (5 cm thickness, 50\%
   glandular fraction), 165 mu m microcalcifications can be distinguished
   at a MGD of 27\% lower than the clinical value (similar to 1.3 mGy). To
   detect 100 mu m microcalcifications, further optimizations of the CMOS
   APS x-ray detector, image aquisition geometry and image reconstruction
   techniques should be considered.}},

Title = {{Assessing compositional variability and migration of natural gas in the
   Antrim Shale in the Michigan Basin using noble gas geochemistry}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{417}},
Pages = {{356-370}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{This study uses stable noble gases' (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) volume
   fractions and isotopic ratios from Antrim Shale natural gas to assess
   compositional variability and vertical fluid migration within this
   reservoir, in addition to distinguishing between the presence of
   thermogenic versus biogenic methane. R/Ra values, where R is the
   measured He-3/He-4 ratio and Ra is the atmospheric value of 1.384 +/-
   0.013 x 10(-6), vary from 0.01 to 0.34 suggesting a largely dominant
   crustal He-4 component with minor atmospheric and mantle contributions.
   Crustal Ne-21, Ar-40 and Xe-136 contributions are also present but the
   atmospheric component is largely dominant for these gases. Crustal
   contributions for Ne-21, Ar-40 and Xe-136 vary between 1.1\% and 12.5\%,
   between 0.7\% and 19\% and between 0.1\% and 2.7\%, respectively. A few
   samples present higher than atmospheric Ne-20/Ne-22 ratios pointing to
   the presence of a small mantle Ne component. High horizontal and
   vertical variability of noble gas signatures in the Antrim Shale are
   observed. These are mainly due to variable noble gas input from deep
   brines and, to a smaller extent, variable in-situ production within
   different layers of the Antrim Shale, in particular, the Lachine and
   Norwood members. Estimated He-4 ages, considering external He-4 input
   for Antrim Shale water, vary between 0.9 ka and 238.2 ka and match well
   for most samples with the timing of the major Wisconsin glaciation,
   suggesting that Antrim Shale water was influenced by glaciation-induced
   recharge. Consistency between measured and predicted Ar-40/Ar-36 ratios
   assuming Ar release temperatures >= 250 degrees C supports a thermogenic
   origin for most of the methane in these samples. This thermogenic
   methane is likely to originate at greater depths, either from the deeper
   portion of the Antrim Shale in the central portion of the Michigan Basin
   or from deeper formations given that the thermal maturity of the Antrim
   Shale in the study area is rather low. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Secretome identification of immune cell factors mediating metastatic

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Metastatic cell homing is a complex process mediated in part by
   diffusible factors secreted from immune cells found at a pre-metastatic
   niche. We report on connecting secretomics and TRanscriptional Activity
   CEll aRray (TRACER) data to identify functional paracrine interactions
   between immune cells and metastatic cells as novel mediators of homing.
   Metastatic breast cancer mouse models were used to generate a diseased
   splenocyte conditioned media (D-SCM) containing immune cell secreted
   factors. MDA-MB-231 metastatic cell activity including cell invasion,
   migration, transendothelial migration, and proliferation were increased
   in D-SCM relative to control media. Our D-SCM secretome analysis yielded
   144 secreted factor candidates that contribute to increased metastatic
   cell activity. The functional mediators of homing were identified using
   MetaCore software to determine interactions between the immune cell
   secretome and the TRACER-identified active transcription factors within
   metastatic cells. Among the 5 candidate homing factors identified,
   haptoglobin was selected and validated in vitro and in vivo as a key
   mediator of homing. Our studies demonstrate a novel systems biology
   approach to identify functional signaling factors associated with a
   cellular phenotype, which provides an enabling tool that complements
   large-scale protein identification provided by proteomics.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{48}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Recent advancements in the synthesis of anisotropic macromolecules and
   nanoparticles have spurred an immense interest in theoretical and
   computational studies of self-assembly. The cornerstone of such studies
   is the role of shape in self-assembly and in inducing complex order. The
   problem of identifying different types of order that can emerge in such
   systems can, however, be challenging. Here, we revisit the problem of
   quantifying orientational order in systems of building blocks with
   non-trivial rotational symmetries. We first propose a systematic way of
   constructing orientational coordinates for such symmetric building
   blocks. We call the arising tensorial coordinates strong orientational
   coordinates (SOCs) as they fully and exclusively specify the orientation
   of a symmetric object. We then use SOCs to describe and quantify local
   and global orientational order, and spatiotemporal orientational
   correlations in systems of symmetric building blocks. The SOCs and the
   orientational order parameters developed in this work are not only
   useful in performing and analyzing computer simulations of symmetric
   molecules or particles, but can also be utilized for the efficient
   storage of rotational information in long trajectories of evolving
   many-body systems.}},

   Produce Live Births in a Mouse Infertility Model}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{The gonadotoxic effects of chemotherapy and radiation may result in
   premature ovarian failure in premenopausal oncology patients. Although
   autotransplantation of ovarian tissue has led to successful live births,
   reintroduction of latent malignant cells inducing relapse is a
   significant concern. In this report, we investigated the design of
   biomaterial grafts for transplantation of isolated ovarian follicles as
   a means to preserve fertility. Primordial and primary ovarian follicles
   from young female mice were extracted and encapsulated into biomaterials
   for subsequent transplantation into adult mice. Among the formulations
   tested, aggregated follicles encapsulated within fibrin had enhanced
   survival and integration with the host tissue following transplantation
   relative to the fibrin-alginate and fibrin-collagen composites. All mice
   transplanted with fibrin-encapsulated follicles resumed cycling, and
   live births were achieved only for follicles transplanted within
   VEGF-loaded fibrin beads. The extent to which these procedures reduce
   the presence of metastatic breast cancer cells among the isolated
   follicles was evaluated, with significantly reduced numbers of cancer
   cells present relative to intact ovaries. This ability to obtain live
   births by transplanting isolated primordial and primary follicles, while
   also reducing the risk of re-seeding disease relative to ovarian tissue
   transplantation, may ultimately provide a means to preserve fertility in
   premenopausal oncology patients.}},

   solution}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{47}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents a systematic evaluation of current crowding and
   spreading resistance in thin film contacts, based on the exact field
   solution that contains very large contrasts in dimensions and
   resistivity. It is found that current crowding becomes more severe as
   the interface specific contact resistivity decreases, the resistivity
   ratio of the contact electrode to the thin film decreases, or the
   thickness of either the contact or the thin film decreases. The current
   transfer length L-T from our exact field solution is compared to that of
   transmission line model (TLM), L-TLM = (rho(c)/rho(sh))(1/2), where
   rho(c) is the interface specific contact resistivity, and rho(sh) is the
   sheet resistance of the thin film under contact. It is found that, if
   rho(c) is small, L-T is bounded by the smaller of the two
   dimensions-thin film thickness and contact size. As rho(c) increases,
   L-T increases, but saturates at a constant value, determined by the
   smaller of the two dimensions-contact size and L-TLM. The total contact
   resistance is decomposed into three components: the interface resistance
   due to rho(c), the spreading resistance due to current crowding, and the
   resistance due to the contact electrode. Unambiguously identified, each
   component is explicitly evaluated and compared in detail.}},

   improved conversion processes. This review collects information
   pertinent to the behavior of microalgae biomolecules (e.g., proteins,
   polysaccharides, lipids, chlorophyll) and their hydrothermal
   decomposition products (e.g., amino acids, sugars, fatty acids) in high
   temperature water (HTW). We report on studies involving individual
   compounds and their mixtures. The mixture systems are particularly
   important as they move closer to mimicking the true chemistry of HTL of
   microalgae by providing opportunities for interactions between different
   molecules that would be present during HTL. Throughout this review, we
   highlight gaps in the understanding of different chemical reactions that

Abstract = {{Indirect absorption plays an important role in the transparency of
   transparent conducting oxides. We provide a detailed first-principles
   study of phonon- and charged-impurity-assisted free-carrier absorption,
   with the example of SnO2. The dominant phonon modes contributing to the
   electron-phonon coupling are identified and used to assess the validity
   of the Frohlich model. We find that phonon-assisted indirect absorption
   dominates if the ionized dopant concentration is below 10(20) cm(-3) and
   that phonon emission dominates this process. We also discuss subtle but
   important issues relating to the calculation of optical transition
   matrix elements.}},

Abstract = {{We report a pulse width modulation (PWM) buck converter that is able to
   achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >80\% in light loads
   (<100 mu A) for implantable biomedical systems. In order to achieve a
   high PCE for the given light loads, the buck converter adaptively
   reconfigures the size of power PMOS and NMOS transistors and their gate
   drivers in accordance with load currents, while operating at a fixed
   frequency of 1 MHz. The buck converter employs the analog-digital hybrid
   control scheme for coarse/fine adjustment of power transistors. The
   coarse digital control generates an approximate duty cycle necessary for
   driving a given load and selects an appropriate width of power
   transistors to minimize redundant power dissipation. The fine analog
   control provides the final tuning of the duty cycle to compensate for
   the error from the coarse digital control. The mode switching between
   the analog and digital controls is accomplished by a mode arbiter which
   estimates the average of duty cycles for the given load condition from
   limit cycle oscillations (LCO) induced by coarse adjustment. The
   fabricated buck converter achieved a peak efficiency of 86.3\% at 1.4 mA
   and > 80\% efficiency for a wide range of load conditions from 45 mu A
   to 4.1 mA, while generating 1 V output from 2.5-3.3 V supply. The
   converter occupies 0.375 mm(2) in 0.18 mu m CMOS processes and requires
   two external components: 1.2 mu F capacitor and 6.8 mu H inductor.}},

Abstract = {{Supporting strong, resilient, and integrated critical infrastructure is
   vital to upholding the U.S. economy and its national security. Arguably,
   no sector of the economy could exist without the reliable and
   predictable networks on which it depends. To date, the research on
   interdependent infrastructure has concentrated on describing the sources
   of the dependencies and developing models for predicting performance and
   cascading disruptions after a hazardous event. However, these models
   fail to capture the perspective of the operators of these networks and
   how competing, independent objectives lead to suboptimal investment
   decisions and hence suboptimal network performance. Rather than focus on
   how interdependent infrastructures operate and possibly fail, we take
   the perspective of their operators and ask why they make the decisions
   that they do. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how strategic
   interdependencies may impact performance of coupled systems by shifting
   investments away from what is collectively best toward decisions that
   are more myopic and optimal from the perspective of a single
   infrastructure. Through our model, we make inferences on the level of
   investments networks make, relate this to performance, and provide
   policy recommendations on how to promote reliable infrastructure.}},

   (MESSENGER) magnetometer data was surveyed between 0.3 and 0.7 AU from 6
   June 2007 to 23 March 2011 for low-frequency wave (LFW) storms, when the
   magnetometer was sampling at a rate of at least 2 s(-1). A total of
   12,197 LFW events were identified, of which 5506 lasted 10 min or
   longer. The events have a high degree of polarization, are circularly
   polarized, with wave vectors nearly aligned or antialigned with the
   interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) at frequencies in the vicinity of
   the proton cyclotron frequency. These events are observed about 6\% of
   the time, preferentially associated with radially directed inward or
   outward IMF. Their occurrence rate and median duration do not change
   much with R, where R is the heliocentric radial distance. For a
   narrow-frequency window in the solar wind frame, left-handed storms in
   the spacecraft frame have a power drop off that is roughly proportional
   to R-3 which is consistent with a source close the Sun, while
   right-handed storms have a power drop off roughly proportional R-1 which
   is not consistent with a source close to the Sun. The power in the
   left-handed LFW storms is on average greater than the right-handed ones
   by a factor of 3. In the solar wind frame, the wave frequency decreases
   from 0.13 to 0.04 Hz moving from 0.3 to 0.7 AU, but the frequency
   normalized by the local proton cyclotron frequency does not change much
   with the running median varying from 0.35 to 0.5. The normalized
   frequency band widths of the wave power spectra increase slightly with
   R, possibly associated with energy dissipation.}},

Abstract = {{The degree to which solar wind driving may affect Saturn's magnetosphere
   is not yet fully understood. We present observations that suggest that
   under some conditions the solar wind does govern the character of the
   plasma sheet in Saturn's outer magnetosphere. On 16 September 2006, the
   Cassini spacecraft, at a radial distance of 37 R-s near local midnight,
   observed a sunward flowing ion population for similar to 5 h, which was
   accompanied by enhanced Saturn Kilometric Radiation emissions. We
   interpret this beam as the outflow from a long-lasting episode of
   Dungey-type reconnection, i.e., reconnection of previously open flux
   containing magnetosheath material. The beam occurred in the middle of a
   several-day interval of SKR activity and enhanced lobe magnetic field
   strength, apparently caused by the arrival of a solar wind compression
   region with significantly higher than average dynamic pressure. The
   arrival of the high-pressure solar wind also marked a change in the
   composition of the plasma-sheet plasma, from water-group-dominated
   material clearly of inner-magnetosphere origin to material dominated by
   light-ion composition, consistent with captured magnetosheath plasma.
   This event suggests that under the influence of prolonged high solar
   wind dynamic pressure, the tail plasma sheet, which normally consists of
   inner-magnetospheric plasma, is eroded away by ongoing reconnection that
   then involves open lobe field lines. This process removes open magnetic
   flux from the lobes and creates a more Earth-like, Dungey-style outer
   plasma sheet dominantly of solar wind origin. This behavior is
   potentially a recurrent phenomenon driven by repeating high-pressure
   streams (corotating interaction regions) in the solar wind, which also
   drive geomagnetic storms at Earth.}},

   However, the ability to study and compare the cell autonomous regulation
   and response of adipocytes from different fat depots has been hampered
   by the difficulty of inducing preadipocytes isolated from the visceral
   depot to differentiate into mature adipocytes in culture. Here, we
   present an easily created 3-dimensional (3D) culture system that can be
   used to differentiate preadipocytes from the visceral depot as robustly
   as those from the sc depot. The cells differentiated in these 3D
   collagen gels are mature adipocytes that retain depot-specific
   characteristics, as determined by imaging, gene expression, and
   functional assays. This 3D culture system therefore allows for study of
   the development and function of adipocytes from both depots in vitro and
   may ultimately lead to a greater understanding of site-specific
   functional differences of adipose tissues to metabolic dysregulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider an inventory system with increasing concave
   ordering cost and average cost optimization criterion. The demand
   process is modeled as a Brownian motion. Porteus (1971) studied a
   discrete-time version of this problem and under the strong condition
   that the demand distribution belongs to the class of densities that are
   finite convolutions of uniform and/or exponential densities (note that
   normal density does not belong to this class), an optimal control policy
   is a generalized (s, 5) policy consisting of a sequence of (s(i), S-i).
   Using a lower bound approach, we show that an optimal control policy for
   the Brownian inventory model is determined by a single pair (s, S).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze a tollbooth tandem queueing problem with an
   infinite number of servers. A customer starts service immediately upon
   arrival but cannot leave the system before all customers who arrived
   before him/her have left, i.e. customers depart the system in the same
   order as they arrive. Distributions of the total number of customers in
   the system, the number of departure-delayed customers in the system, and
   the number of customers in service at time t are obtained in closed
   form. Distributions of the sojourn times and departure delays of
   customers are also obtained explicitly. Both transient and steady state
   solutions are derived first for Poisson arrivals, and then extended to
   cases with batch Poisson and nonstationary Poisson arrival processes.
   Finally, we report several stochastic ordering results on how system
   performance measures are affected by arrival and service processes.}},

   mice. Spikes were robustly induced by 60 nW light power, and fast
   population oscillations were induced at the microwatt range. To
   demonstrate the spatiotemporal precision of parallel stimulation and
   recording, we achieved independent control of distinct cells similar to
   50 mu m apart and of differential somato-dendritic compartments of

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we provide some reflections on how to define and
   understand the concept of terrorism risk in a professional risk
   assessment context. As a basis for this discussion we introduce a set of
   criteria that we believe should apply to any conceptualization of
   terrorism risk. These criteria are based on both criteria used in other
   areas of risk analysis and our experience with terrorism risk analysis.
   That is, these criteria offer our perspective. We show that several of
   the suggested perspectives and definitions have weaknesses in relation
   to these criteria. A main problem identified is the idea that terrorism
   risk can be conceptualized as a function of probability and consequence,
   not as a function of the interactions between adaptive individuals and
   organizations. We argue that perspectives based solely on probability
   and consequence should be used cautiously or not at all because they
   fail to reflect the essential features of the concept of terrorism risk,
   the threats and attacks, their consequences, and the uncertainties, all
   in the context of adaptation by the adversaries. These three elements
   should in our view constitute the main pillars of the terrorism risk
   concept. From this concept we can develop methods for assessing the risk
   by identifying a set of threats, attacks, and consequence measures
   associated with the possible outcome scenarios together with a
   description of the uncertainties and interactions between the
   adversaries.}},

Abstract = {{In situ-forming implants are a promising platform used for the release
   of therapeutic agents. Significant changes in behavior occur when the
   implants are used in vivo relative to implants formed in vitro. To
   understand how the injection site effects implant behavior,
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) implants were examined after injection in
   the subcutaneous space of a Sprague-Dawley rat model to determine how
   the environment altered implant erosion, degradation, swelling,
   microstructure, and mock drug release. Changes in implant microstructure
   occurred over time for implants formed in vivo, where it was observed
   that the porosity was lost over the course of 5 days. Implants formed in
   vivo had a significantly greater burst release (p < 0.05) relative to
   implants formed in vitro. However, during the diffusion period of
   release, implants formed in vitro had a significantly higher daily
   release (2.1\%/day, p < 0.05), which correlated to changes in implant
   microstructure. Additionally, implants formed in vitro had a two-fold
   increase in the first-order degradation kinetics relative to the
   implants formed in vivo. These findings suggest that the changes in
   implant behavior occur as a result of changes in the implant
   microstructure induced by the external environment. (C) 2015 Wiley

Title = {{Properties of microplasmas excited by microwaves for VUV photon sources}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Microplasma sources typically take advantage of pd (pressure x size)
   scaling by increasing pressure to operate at dimensions as small as tens
   of microns. In many applications, low pressure operation is desirable,
   which makes miniaturization difficult. In this paper, the
   characteristics of low pressure microplasma sources excited by microwave
   power are discussed based on results from experimental and computational
   studies. The intended application is production of VUV radiation for
   chemical analysis, and so emphasis in this study is on the production of
   resonant excited states of rare gases and radiation transport. The
   systems of interest operate at a few to 10 Torr in Ar and He/Ar mixtures
   with cavity dimensions of hundreds of microns to 1 mm. Power deposition
   is a few watts which produces fractional ionization of about 0.1\%. We
   found that production of VUV radiation from argon microplasmas at 104.8
   nm and 106.7 nm saturates as a function of power deposition due to a
   quasi-equilibrium that is established between the electron temperature
   (that is not terribly sensitive to power deposition) and the population
   of the Ar(4s) manifold.}},

   these models to a particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo (PIC/MC) code, using a 1D
   test problem. The tests are performed in neon and nitrogen at standard
   temperature and pressure, over a wide range of reduced electric fields.
   For the fluid models, transport data generated by a multi-term Boltzmann

   predictions and address some of the practical aspects when using these

Abstract = {{A simple method to cryopreserve adherent monolayers of neuronal cells is
   currently not available, but the development of this technique could
   facilitate numerous applications in the field of biomedical engineering,
   cell line development, and drug screening. However, complex tissues of
   some exceptional animals survive freezing in nature. These animals are
   known to accumulate several small molecular weight solutes prior to
   freezing. Following a similar strategy, we investigated the effects of
   osmolytes such as trehalose, proline, and sucrose as additives to the
   traditional cryoprotectant dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) in modulating the
   cryopreservation outcome of mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells.
   Neuro-2a cells adhered to cell culture plates were incubated for 24 h at
   varying concentrations of trehalose, proline, sucrose and combinations
   of these compounds. Cells were cryopreserved for 24 h and cell viability
   post-freezing and thawing was quantified by trypan blue exclusion assay.
   On average, only 13.5\% of adherent cells survived freezing in the
   presence of 10\% Me2SO alone (control). Pre-incubation of cells with
   medium containing both trehalose and praline severely decreased cell
   proliferation, but increased cell recovery to about 53\% of control.
   Furthermore, characterization using Raman microspectroscopy revealed
   that the addition of both trehalose and praline to 10\% Me2SO
   substantially increased the size, and altered the nature, of ice
   crystals formed during freezing. Our results suggest that pre-incubation
   of Neuro-2a cells with trehalose and praline in combination provides
   cell protection along with alterations of ice structure in order to
   increase cell survival post-freezing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Eco-driving at signalized intersections has significant potential for
   energy saving. In this paper, we focus on eco-departure operations of
   connected vehicles equipped with an internal combustion engine and a
   step-gear automatic transmission. A Bolza-type optimal control problem
   (OCP) is formulated to minimize engine fuel consumption. Due to the
   discrete gear ratio, this OCP is a nonlinear mixed-integer problem,
   which is challenging to handle by most existing optimization methods.
   The Legendre pseudospectral method combining the knotting technique is
   employed to convert it into a multistage interconnected nonlinear
   programming problem, which then solves the optimal engine torque and
   transmission gear position. The fuel-saving benefit of the optimized
   eco-departing operation is validated by a passenger car with a
   five-speed transmission. For real-time implementation, a near-optimal
   departing strategy is proposed to quickly determine the behavior of the
   engine and transmission. When a string of vehicles are departing from an
   intersection, the acceleration of the leading vehicle(s) should be
   considered to control the following vehicles. This issue is also
   addressed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Matched field processing (MFP) is an established technique for source
   localization in known multipath acoustic environments. Unfortunately, in
   many situations, particularly those involving high frequency signals,
   imperfect knowledge of the actual propagation environment prevents
   accurate propagation modeling and source localization via MFP fails. For
   beamforming applications, this actual-to-model mismatch problem was
   mitigated through a frequency downshift, made possible by a nonlinear
   array-signal-processing technique called frequency difference
   beamforming {[}Abadi, Song, and Dowling (2012). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 132,
   3018-3029]. Here, this technique is extended to conventional (Bartlett)
   MFP using simulations and measurements from the 2011 Kauai Acoustic
   Communications MURI experiment (KAM11) to produce ambiguity surfaces at
   frequencies well below the signal bandwidth where the detrimental
   effects of mismatch are reduced. Both the simulation and experimental
   results suggest that frequency difference MFP can be more robust against
   environmental mismatch than conventional MFP. In particular, signals of
   frequency 11.2 kHz-32.8 kHz were broadcast 3 km through a 106-m-deep
   shallow ocean sound channel to a sparse 16-element vertical receiving
   array. Frequency difference MFP unambiguously localized the source in
   several experimental data sets with average peak-to-side-lobe ratio of
   0.9 dB, average absolutevalue range error of 170 m, and average
   absolute-value depth error of 10 m. (C) 2015 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {{The immersed boundary method was utilised to numerically investigate the
   flow-induced vibrations (FIV) of two elastically mounted side-by-side
   circular cylinders in a uniform flow with low Reynolds numbers. Six
   distinct near-wake patterns were observed; the irregular (IR) pattern,
   the in-phase synchronized (IS) pattern, the anti-phase synchronized (AS)
   pattern, the biased anti-phase synchronized (BAS) pattern, the
   out-of-phase flip-flopping (OFF) pattern, and the hybrid (HB) pattern. A
   detailed analysis on the asymmetric vibration and symmetry hysteresis
   phenomena was conducted by focusing on the near-wake patterns and the
   interaction between the cylinders. Results show that the asymmetric
   vibrations of the cylinders are closely related with the stably biased
   gap flow and the resulting narrow-wide near-wake pattern. While the
   symmetry hysteresis is caused by the coexistence of two distinct
   near-wake patterns - the IS and the BAS patterns. The transition
   processes of BAS to IS and IS to BAS were illustrated by using the
   long-time histories of the lift coefficients, the combined lift
   coefficient and the phase differences of lift and displacement. Results
   on hydrodynamic forces and the vibration responses show that the HB
   pattern is a combination of IS, OFF and AS patterns with a very long
   period. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gas embolotherapy is achieved by locally vaporizing microdroplets
   through acoustic droplet vaporization, which results in bubbles that are
   large enough to occlude blood flow directed to tumors. Endothelial
   cells, lining blood vessels, can be affected by these vaporization
   events, resulting in cell injury and cell death. An idealized monolayer
   of endothelial cells was subjected to acoustic droplet vaporization
   using a 3.5-MHz transducer and dodecafluoropentane droplets. Treatments
   included insonation pressures that varied from 2 to 8 MPa
   (rarefactional) and pulse lengths that varied from 4 to 16 input cycles.
   The bubble cloud generated was directly dependent on pressure, but not
   on pulse length. Cellular damage increased with increasing bubble cloud
   size, but was limited to the bubble cloud area. These results suggest
   that vaporization near the endothelium may impact the vessel wall, an
   effect that could be either deleterious or beneficial depending on the
   intended overall therapeutic application. (C) 2015 World Federation for

Abstract = {{Robust electric conduction under stretching motions is a key element in
   upcoming wearable electronic devices but is fundamentally very difficult
   to achieve because percolation pathways in conductive media are subject
   to collapse upon stretching. Here, we report that this fundamental
   challenge can be overcome by using a parameter uniquely available in
   textiles, namely a weaving structure. A textile structure alternately
   interwoven with inelastic and elastic yarns, achieved via a tricot
   weave, possesses excellent elasticity (strain up to 200\%) in diagonal
   directions. When this textile is coated with conductive nanomaterials,
   proper textile engineering allows the textile to obtain an unprecedented
   7-fold conductivity increase, with conductivity reaching 33,0005 cm(-1),
   even at 130\% strain, due to enhanced interyarn contacts. The observed
   stretching conductivity can be described well using a modified 3D
   percolation theory that reflects the weaving effect and is also utilized
   for stretchable electronic interconnects and supercapacitors with high
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Central auditory circuits are influenced by the somatosensory system, a
   relationship that may underlie tinnitus generation. In the guinea pig
   dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), pairing spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5)
   stimulation with tones at specific intervals and orders facilitated or
   suppressed subsequent tone-evoked neural responses, reflecting spike
   timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Furthermore, after noise-induced
   tinnitus, bimodal responses in DCN were shifted from Hebbian to
   anti-Hebbian timing rules with less discrete temporal windows,
   suggesting a role for bimodal plasticity in tinnitus. Here, we aimed to
   determine if multisensory STDP principles like those in DCN also exist
   in primary auditory cortex (A1), and whether they change following
   noise-induced tinnitus. Tone-evoked and spontaneous neural responses
   were recorded before and 15 min after bimodal stimulation in which the
   intervals and orders of auditory-somatosensory stimuli were randomized.
   Tone-evoked and spontaneous firing rates were influenced by the interval
   and order of the bimodal stimuli, and in sham-controls Hebbian-like
   timing rules predominated as was seen in DCN. In noise-exposed animals
   with and without tinnitus, timing rules shifted away from those found in
   sham-controls to more anti-Hebbian rules. Only those animals with
   evidence of tinnitus showed increased spontaneous firing rates, a
   purported neurophysiological correlate of tinnitus in A1. Together,
   these findings suggest that bimodal plasticity is also evident in A1
   following noise damage and may have implications for tinnitus generation
   and therapeutic intervention across the central auditory circuit.}},

Title = {{Influence of morphological disorder on in- and out-of-plane charge
   transport in conjugated polymer films}},

Abstract = {{Thin films of the conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) of
   different morphological structures were fabricated using both
   conventional spin-casting and the matrix-assisted pulsed laser
   evaporation (MAPLE). Films deposited by MAPLE exhibit inhomogeneous
   morphologies comprised globular subfeatures with dimensions of the order
   of 100 nm. We show that whereas the in-plane carrier mobilities of
   MAPLE-deposited films (8.3 x 10(-3) cm(2)/V/s) are comparable with those
   of spin-cast analogs (5.5 x 10(-3) cm(2)/V/s), the out-of-plane
   mobilities are an order of magnitude lower (4.1 x 10(-4) cm(2)/V/s
   versus 2.7 x 10(-3) cm(2)/V/s). Both in- and out-of-plane carrier
   transport characteristics of MAPLE-deposited films indicate a broad
   density of states and high carrier trap concentration. Optical
   absorbance spectroscopy not only corroborates a high degree of energetic
   disorder in MAPLE-deposited films, but also suggests that the P3HT
   chains possess average conjugation lengths comparable with spin-cast
   counterparts. Our findings, rationalized in terms of the Gaussian
   Disorder Model, describing carrier transport in an environment
   characterized by both positional and energetic disorder, provide
   important perspectives on the extent to which disorder impacts
   mechanisms of charge transport in conjugated polymers.}},

Title = {{Suppressing molecular motions for enhanced room-temperature
   phosphorescence of metal-free organic materials}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Metal-free organic phosphorescent materials are attractive alternatives
   to the predominantly used organometallic phosphors but are generally
   dimmer and are relatively rare, as, without heavy-metal atoms,
   spin-orbit coupling is less efficient and phosphorescence usually cannot
   compete with radiationless relaxation processes. Here we present a
   general design rule and a method to effectively reduce radiationless
   transitions and hence greatly enhance phosphorescence efficiency of
   metal-free organic materials in a variety of amorphous polymer matrices,
   based on the restriction of molecular motions in the proximity of
   embedded phosphors. Covalent cross-linking between phosphors and polymer
   matrices via Diels-Alder click chemistry is devised as a method. A sharp
   increase in phosphorescence quantum efficiency is observed in a variety
   of polymer matrices with this method, which is ca. two to five times
   higher than that of phosphor-doped polymer systems having no such
   covalent linkage.}},

Abstract = {{Analogous to the thiol-ene and phosphane-ene polymerizations,
   radical-mediated iodo-ene reactions are described here that proceed via
   alternating propagation and chain transfer (i.e., APT) reactions between
   perfluoroiodide- and vinyl-bearing monomers. The thermal polymerization
   of a diiodo/tetraene formulation yielded a cross-linked, homogeneous
   polymer that was approximately seven times as radiopaque as aluminum
   owing to its high iodine content. Visible-light photopolymerizations of
   model iodo-ene monomers were monitored using mid-IR spectroscopy,
   revealing that the perfluoroiodide functional group consumption exceeded
   that of the vinyl, a discrepancy that decreased with increasing
   irradiation intensities and hence polymerization rates. The functional
   group conversions in resin formulations with a large initial
   perfluoroiodide excess exacerbated secondary side reactions that led to
   off-stoichiometric functional group consumption; nevertheless,
   photopolymerization of resin formulations with excess vinyl
   stoichiometry proceeded according to the ideal APT mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular-targeted carrier (VTC) interaction with human plasma is known
   to reduce targeted adhesion efficiency in vitro. However, the role of
   plasma proteins on the adhesion efficiency of VTCs in laboratory animals
   remains unknown. Here, in vitro blood flow assays are used to explore
   the effects of plasma from mouse, rabbit, and porcine on VTC adhesion.
   Porcine blood exhibited a strong negative plasma effect on VTC adhesion
   while no significant plasma effect was found with rabbit and mouse
   blood. A brush density poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on VTCs was effective
   at improving adhesion of microsized, but not nanosized, VTCs in porcine
   blood. Overall, the results suggest that porcine models, as opposed to
   mouse, can serve as better models in preclinical research for predicting
   the in vivo functionality of VTCs for use in humans. These
   considerations hold great importance for the design of various

   locomotion}},
Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This research proposes a new approach for the control of metameric robot
   locomotion via phase coordination. Unlike previous studies where global
   wave-like rules were pre-specified to construct the actuation sequence
   of segments, this phase coordination method generates robot locomotion
   by assigning the actuation phase differences between adjacent segments
   without any global prerequisite rules. To effectively coordinate the
   phase differences, different symmetry properties are introduced.
   Optimization is then carried out on various symmetrically coordinated
   phase-difference patterns to maximize the average steady-state velocity
   of the robot. It is shown that the maximum average velocity is always
   achieved when the reflectional symmetry is included in the
   phase-difference pattern, and the identical-phase-difference (IPD)
   pattern is preferred for implementation because it reduces the number of
   independent phase variables to only one without significant loss in
   locomotion performance. Extensive analytical investigations on the IPD
   pattern reveal the relationship between the average locomotion velocity
   and some important parameters. Theoretical findings on the relationship
   between the average velocity and the phase difference in the IPD pattern
   are verified via experimental investigations on an 8-segment
   earthworm-like metameric robot prototype. Finally, this paper reveals an
   interesting result that the optimized phase-difference pattern can
   naturally generate peristalsis waves in metameric robot locomotion
   without global prerequisite wave-like rules.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate phase stability in the Zr-O system from first principles,
   focusing in particular on the finite temperature stability of the newly

   vibrational excitations. Phonon calculations within the quasi-harmonic
   approximation predict that delta'-ZrO is stable to at least 1500 K.
   Quasi-harmonic phonon calculations also predict an alpha- to beta-ZrO2
   transition temperature of 1440 K. Stiff Zr-O bonds are responsible for a
   low vibrational entropy in the delta'-ZrO phase compared to competing
   oxides in the Zr-O binary, resulting in a reduction in its stability
   relative to ZrO1/2 and ZrO2 with increasing temperature. The calculated
   thermodynamic properties are relevant to understanding oxidation
   mechanisms of Zr-based alloys. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general method of incorporating CALPHAD-based free
   energies into a phase field model. While CALPHAD-based free energy
   descriptions provide realistic energetics of alloys, their formulations
   may pose numerical difficulties for phase field simulations.
   Specifically, the free energies of mixing for different phases may not
   necessarily be defined over the same concentration ranges, and their
   derivatives may exhibit highly nonlinear behavior. The method presented
   approximates the free energies of mixing using piecewise functions to
   eliminate the aforementioned characteristics while largely retaining the
   free energy values and the first and second derivative information,
   which affect the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of the system. The
   method is verified by planar interface simulations of the
   alpha-zirconium/delta-hydride system. The phase fractions and
   compositions obtained from the phase field simulations are compared to
   the values calculated from the common tangent construction on the
   original free energies. The results indicate a high degree of accuracy.

Abstract = {{Remanent bubble nuclei generated by primary cavitation collapse can
   limit the efficiency of histotripsy soft-tissue fractionation. When
   these residual bubbles persist from one histotripsy pulse to the next,
   they can seed the repetitive nucleation of cavitation bubbles at a
   discrete set of sites within the focal volume. This effect-referred to
   as cavitation memory-manifests in inefficient lesion formation, because
   certain sites within the focal volume are overtreated whereas others
   remain undertreated. Although the cavitation memory effect can be
   passively mitigated by using a low pulse repetition frequency (PRF) that
   affords remanent nuclei sufficient time for dissolution between
   successive pulses, this low PRF also results in slow lesion production.
   As such, it would be highly desirable to maintain the high per-pulse
   efficiency associated with low pulse rates when much higher PRFs are
   utilized. In this vein, we have developed a strategy for the active
   removal of the remanent bubble nuclei following primary cavitation
   collapse, using low-amplitude ultrasound sequences (termed
   bubble-removal sequences) to stimulate the aggregation and subsequent
   coalescence of these bubbles. In this study, bubble-removal sequences
   were incorporated in high-PRF histotripsy treatment (100 Hz) of a red
   blood cell tissue-mimicking phantom that allows for the visualization of
   lesion development in real time. A series of reference treatments were
   also conducted at the low PRF of 1 Hz to provide a point of comparison
   for which cavitation memory effects are minimal. It was found that
   bubble-removal sequences as short as 1 ms are capable of maintaining the
   efficacious lesion development characteristics associated with the low
   PRF of 1 Hz when the much higher pulse rate of 100 Hz is used. These
   results were then extended to the treatment of a large volume within the
   tissue phantom, and optimal bubble-removal sequences identified for the
   single-focal-spot case were utilized to homogenize a 10 x 10 mm region
   at high rate.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy fractionates soft tissue by well-controlled acoustic
   cavitation using microsecond-long, high-intensity ultrasound pulses. The
   feasibility of using histotripsy as a noninvasive, drug-free, and
   image-guided thrombolysis method has been shown previously. A new
   histotripsy approach, termed microtripsy, has recently been investigated
   for the thrombolysis application to improve treatment accuracy and avoid
   potential vessel damage. In this study, we investigated the effects of
   pulse repetition frequency (PRF) on microtripsy thrombolysis.
   Microtripsy thrombolysis treatments using different PRFs (5, 50, and 100
   Hz) and doses (20, 50, and 100 pulses) were performed on blood clots in
   an in vitro vessel flow model. To quantitatively evaluate the
   microtripsy thrombolysis effect, the location of focal cavitation, the
   incident rate of pre-focal cavitation on the vessel wall, the size and
   location of the resulting flow channel, and the generated clot debris
   particles were measured. The results demonstrated that focal cavitation
   was always well confined in the vessel lumen without contacting the
   vessel wall for all PRFs. Pre-focal cavitation on the front vessel wall
   was never observed at 5Hz PRF, but occasionally observed at PRFs of 50
   Hz (1.2\%) and 100 Hz (5.4\%). However, the observed pre-focal
   cavitation was weak and did not significantly affect the focal
   cavitation. Results further demonstrated that, although the extent of
   clot fractionation per pulse was the highest at 5 Hz PRF at the
   beginning of treatment (<20 pulses), 100 Hz PRF generated the largest
   flow channels with a much shorter treatment time. Finally, results
   showed fewer large debris particles were generated at a higher PRF.
   Overall, the results of this study suggest that a higher PRF (50 or 100
   Hz) may be a better choice for microtripsy thrombolysis to use
   clinically due to the larger resulting flow channel, shorter treatment
   time, and smaller debris particles.}},

Title = {{A study of active learning methods for named entity recognition in
   clinical text}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{11-18}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Named entity recognition (NER), a sequential labeling task,
   is one of the fundamental tasks for building clinical natural language
   processing (NLP) systems. Machine learning (ML) based approaches can
   achieve good performance, but they often require large amounts of
   annotated samples, which are expensive to build due to the requirement
   of domain experts in annotation. Active learning (AL), a sample
   selection approach integrated with supervised ML, aims to minimize the
   annotation cost while maximizing the performance of ML-based models. In
   this study, our goal was to develop and evaluate both existing and new
   AL methods for a clinical NER task to identify concepts of medical
   problems, treatments, and lab tests from the clinical notes.
   Methods: Using the annotated NER corpus from the 2010 i2b2/VA NLP
   challenge that contained 349 clinical documents with 20,423 unique
   sentences, we simulated AL experiments using a number of existing and
   novel algorithms in three different categories including
   uncertainty-based, diversity-based, and baseline sampling strategies.
   They were compared with the passive learning that uses random sampling.
   Learning curves that plot performance of the NER model against the
   estimated annotation cost (based on number of sentences or words in the
   training set) were generated to evaluate different active learning and
   the passive learning methods and the area under the learning curve (ALC)
   score was computed.
   Results: Based on the learning curves of F-measure vs. number of
   sentences, uncertainty sampling algorithms outperformed all other
   methods in ALC. Most diversity-based methods also performed better than
   random sampling in ALC. To achieve an F-measure of 0.80, the best method
   based on uncertainty sampling could save 66\% annotations in sentences,
   as compared to random sampling. For the learning curves of F-measure vs.
   number of words, uncertainty sampling methods again outperformed all
   other methods in ALC. To achieve 0.80 in F-measure, in comparison to
   random sampling, the best uncertainty based method saved 42\%
   annotations in words. But the best diversity based method reduced only
   7\% annotation effort.
   Conclusion: In the simulated setting, AL methods, particularly
   uncertainty-sampling based approaches, seemed to significantly save
   annotation cost for the clinical NER task. The actual benefit of active
   learning in clinical NER should be further evaluated in a real-time
   setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Brillouin dynamic gratings have applications ranging from sensing to
   slow and stored light. When transform-limited pump pulses are used, the
   grating strength and the efficiency of light storage and retrieval are a
   periodic function of pulse area and can be zero for areas that are an
   integer multiple of pi. In this paper the dependence of the dynamic
   grating strength and retrieval efficiency on pulse area is investigated
   for chirped pulses. It is found that the presence of chirp relaxes the
   requirement imposed on the pulse area that it be an odd multiple of pi/2
   for maximum efficiency. Analytical results are presented for the
   dependence of grating strength on the pulse area for both chirped and
   unchirped pulses. A comparison is made with the analogous process of
   adiabatic rapid passage in two-level atomic systems. (C) 2015 Optical

Title = {{Independent Component Analysis of Gait-Related Movement Artifact
   Recorded using EEG Electrodes during Treadmill Walking}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{There has been a recent surge in the use of electroencephalography (EEG)
   as a tool for mobile brain imaging due to its portability and fine time
   resolution. When EEG is combined with independent component analysis
   (ICA) and source localization techniques, it can model electrocortical
   activity as arising from temporally independent signals located in
   spatially distinct cortical areas. However, for mobile tasks, it is not
   clear how movement artifacts influence ICA and source localization. We
   devised a novel method to collect pure movement artifact data (devoid of
   any electrophysiological signals) with a 256-channel EEG system. We
   first blocked true electrocortical activity using a silicone swim cap.
   Over the silicone layer, we placed a simulated scalp with electrical
   properties similar to real human scalp. We collected EEG movement
   artifact signals from ten healthy, young subjects wearing this setup as
   they walked on a treadmill at speeds from 0.4-1.6 m/s. We performed ICA
   and dipole fitting on the EEG movement artifact data to quantify how
   accurately these methods would identify the artifact signals as non
   neural. ICA and dipole fitting accurately localized 99\% of the
   independent components in non-neural locations or lacked dipolar
   characteristics. The remaining 1\% of sources had locations within the
   brain volume and low residual variances, but had topographical maps,
   power spectra, time courses, and event related spectral perturbations
   typical of non neural sources. Caution should be exercised when
   interpreting ICA for data that includes semi-periodic artifacts
   including artifact arising from human walking. Alternative methods are
   needed for the identification and separation of movement artifact in
   mobile EEG signals, especially methods that can be performed in real
   time. Separating true brain signals from motion artifact could clear the
   way for EEG brain computer interfaces for assistance during mobile
   activities, such as walking.}},

   measurements and the analysis method developed to interpret them provide
   an important step toward the possibility of observing self-similarity
   under such conditions, as well as a general platform for performing and
   analyzing hydrodynamic instability experiments. A key feature of these
   experiments is that the shock is sustained sufficiently long that this
   nonlinear behavior occurs without decay of the shock velocity or other
   hydrodynamic properties of the system, which facilitates analysis and
   allows the results to be used in the study of analytic models. Published

Title = {{Assessing the Dosimetric Accuracy of Magnetic Resonance-Generated
   Synthetic CT Images for Focal Brain VMAT Radiation Therapy}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the dosimetric accuracy
   of synthetic CT (MRCT) volumes generated from magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) data for focal brain radiation therapy.
   Methods and Materials: A study was conducted in 12 patients with gliomas
   who underwent both MR and CT imaging as part of their simulation for
   external beam treatment planning. MRCT volumes were generated from MR
   images. Patients' clinical treatment planning directives were used to
   create 12 individual volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans,
   which were then optimized 10 times on each of their respective CT and
   MRCT-derived electron density maps. Dose metrics derived from
   optimization criteria, as well as monitor units and gamma analyses, were
   evaluated to quantify differences between the imaging modalities.
   Results: Mean differences between planning target volume (PTV) doses on
   MRCT and CT plans across all patients were 0.0\% (range: -0.1 to 0.2\%)
   for D-95\%; 0.0\% (-0.7 to 0.6\%) for D-5\%; and -0.2\% (-1.0 to 0.2\%)
   for D-max. MRCT plans showed no significant changes in monitor units
   (-0.4\%) compared to CT plans. Organs at risk (OARs) had average Dmax
   differences of 0.0 Gy (-2.2 to 1.9 Gy) over 85 structures across all 12
   patients, with no significant differences when calculated doses
   approached planning constraints.
   Conclusions: Focal brain VMAT plans optimized on MRCT images show
   excellent dosimetric agreement with standard CT-optimized plans. PTVs
   show equivalent coverage, and OARs do not show any overdose. These
   results indicate that MRI-derived synthetic CT volumes can be used to
   support treatment planning of most patients treated for intracranial
   lesions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impact of Parameterized Physical Processes on Simulated Tropical Cyclone
   Characteristics in the Community Atmosphere Model}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{9857-9872}},

Abstract = {{This study advances the understanding of how parameterized physical
   processes affect the development of tropical cyclones (TCs) in the
   Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) using the Reed-Jablonowski TC test
   case. It examines the impact of changes in 24 parameters across multiple
   physical parameterization schemes that represent convection, turbulence,
   precipitation, and cloud processes. The one-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity
   analysis method quantifies the relative influence of each parameter on
   TC simulations and identifies which parameters affect six different TC
   characteristics: intensity, precipitation, longwave cloud radiative
   forcing (LWCF), shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCF), cloud liquid
   water path (LWP), and ice water path (IWP). It is shown that TC
   intensity is mainly sensitive to the parcel fractional mass entrainment
   rate (dmpdz) in deep convection. A decrease in this parameter can lead
   to a change in simulated intensity from a tropical depression to a
   category-4 storm. Precipitation and SWCF are strongly affected by three
   parameters in deep convection: tau (time scale for consumption rate of
   convective available potential energy), dmpdz, and C0\_ocn
   (precipitation coefficient). Changes in physical parameters generally do
   not affect LWCF much. In contrast, LWP and IWP are very sensitive to
   changes in C0\_ocn. The changes can be as large as 10 (5) times the
   control mean value for LWP (IWP). Further examination of the response
   functions for the subset of most sensitive parameters reveals nonlinear
   relationships between parameters and most output variables, suggesting
   that linear perturbation analysis may produce misleading results when
   applied to strongly nonlinear systems.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum dots (QDs) show promise as the absorber in nanostructured thin
   film solar cells, but achieving high device efficiencies requires
   surface treatments to minimize interfacial recombination. In this work,
   lead sulfide (PbS) QDs are grown on a mesoporous TiO2 film with a
   crystalline TiO2 surface, versus one coated with an amorphous TiO2 layer
   by atomic layer deposition (ALD). These mesoporous TiO2 films sensitized
   with PbS QDs are characterized by X-ray and electron diffraction, as
   well as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in order to link XAS
   features with structural distortions in the PbS QDs. The XAS features
   are further analyzed with quantum simulations to probe the geometric and
   electronic structure of the PbS QD-TiO2 interface. We show that the
   anatase TiO2 surface structure induces PbS bond angle distortions, which
   increases the energy gap of the PbS QDs at the interface.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle speed trajectory significantly impacts fuel consumption and
   greenhouse gas emissions, especially for trips on signalized arterials.
   Although a large amount of research has been conducted aiming at
   providing optimal speed advisory to drivers, impacts from queues at
   intersections are not considered. Ignoring the constraints induced by
   queues could result in suboptimal or infeasible solutions. In this
   study, a multi-stage optimal control formulation is proposed to obtain
   the optimal vehicle trajectory on signalized arterials, where both
   vehicle queue and traffic light status are considered. To facilitate the
   real-time update of the optimal speed trajectory, a constrained
   optimization model is proposed as an approximation approach, which can
   be solved much quicker. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed optimal control model and the solution efficiency of the
   proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an optimization model based on vehicle travel patterns to
   capture public charging demand and select the locations of public
   charging stations to maximize the amount of vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT)
   being electrified. The formulated model is applied to Beijing, China as
   a case study using vehicle trajectory data of 11,880 taxis over a period
   of three weeks. The mathematical problem is formulated in GAMS modeling
   environment and Cplex optimizer is used to find the optimal solutions.
   Formulating mathematical model properly, input data transformation, and
   Cplex option adjustment are considered for accommodating large-scale
   data. We show that, compared to the 40 existing public charging
   stations, the 40 optimal ones selected by the model can increase
   electrified fleet VMT by 59\% and 88\% for slow and fast charging,
   respectively. Charging demand for the taxi fleet concentrates in the
   inner city. When the total number of charging stations increase, the
   locations of the optimal stations expand outward from the inner city.
   While more charging stations increase the electrified fleet VMT, the
   marginal gain diminishes quicldy regardless of charging speed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Systemic inflammatory disorders resulting from infection, trauma,
   surgery, and severe disease conditions pose serious threats to human
   health leading to organ dysfunction, organ failure, and mortality. The
   highly complex and dynamic nature of the immune system experiencing
   acute inflammation makes immunomodulatory therapy blocking
   pro-inflammatory cytokines very challenging. Successful therapy requires
   the ability to determine appropriate anti-cytokine drugs to be delivered
   at a right dose in a timely manner. Label-free micro- and
   nano-biosensors hold the potential to overcome the current challenges,
   enabling cytokine-targeted treatments to be tailored according to the
   immune status of an individual host with their unique cytokine biomarker
   detection capabilities. This review studies the recent progress in
   label-free cytokine biosensors, summarizes their performances and
   potential merits, and discusses future directions for their advancements
   to meet challenges towards personalized anti-cytoldne drug delivery. (C)

Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The handling of constraints in systems subject to variable time-delay is
   a challenging problem. It is particularly relevant to Network Control
   Systems (NCSs) in which a control system is remotely located with
   respect to the plant to be controlled. In this paper, we develop
   reference governors for controlling constrained systems subject to
   variable delays with a particular focus on the application to NCSs. In
   the proposed approach, which neither exploits nor depends on any
   explicit synchronization between the plant and the governor, the
   closed-loop dynamics are modeled by a sampled data system, for which
   input delays result in additive disturbances with magnitude proportional
   to the input rate of change. We first develop a network reference
   governor (netRG) that guarantees constraint enforcement and finite-time
   convergence for variable time-delay shorter than the sampling period.
   Then, we extend the network reference governor to the case of output
   feedback. Finally, we consider the case of long and potentially
   unbounded delay. The netRG is evaluated in a case study of orientation
   control of a spacecraft with a flexible appendage. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Gleason score is a highly prognostic factor for prostate cancer
   describing the microscopic architecture of the tumor tissue. The
   standard procedure for evaluating Gleason scores, namely biopsy, is to
   remove prostate tissue for observation under microscope. Currently,
   biopsies are guided by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). Due to the low
   sensitivity of TRUS to prostate cancer (PCa), non-guided and saturated
   biopsies are frequently employed, unavoidably causing pain, damage to
   the normal prostate tissues and other complications. More importantly,
   due to the limited number of biopsy cores, current procedure could
   either miss early stage small tumors or undersample aggressive cancers.
   Photoacoustic (PA) measurement has the unique capability of evaluating
   tissue microscopic architecture information at ultrasonic resolution. By
   frequency domain analysis of the broadband PA signal, namely PA spectral
   analysis (PASA), the microscopic architecture within the assessed tissue
   can be quantified. This study investigates the feasibility of evaluating
   Gleason scores by PASA. Simulations with the classic Gleason patterns
   and experiment measurements from human PCa tissues have demonstrated
   strong correlation between the PASA parameters and the Gleason scores.

Abstract = {{Coordination polymers (CPs) have recently emerged as a promising class
   of high energy materials useful for the synthesis of tailored energetic
   materials. CPs have shown potential to improve energetic performance
   relative to conventional organic energetic materials with regard to

   a variety of energetic linkers have been applied, and success has been
   achieved across a number of structure classes including nitrogen-rich
   heterocycles and azides. Here, the current progress in the field of
   energetic CPs, both from the standpoint of structure and properties, is
   reviewed, and a perspective on current challenges and promising future
   directions for the field are delineated. Inasmuch as structure/function
   relationships have been elucidated for CPs with particular applications
   in mind, these are discussed as well as shortcomings in experimental
   work required to firmly establish predictive principles within the realm

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate loss mechanisms in piezoelectric-on-silica
   bulk acoustic wave resonators, including those resulting from
   thermoelastic damping (TED), surface roughness, and supporting tethers.
   Alternate resonator designs, piezoelectric materials, and fabrication
   processes are demonstrated to empirically test these loss mechanisms.
   Quality factors (Qs) in the order of similar to 16 000 at a center
   frequency of 5 MHz have been consistently measured for aluminum nitride
   (AlN)-on-silica coupled-ring resonators. It is shown that neither TED
   nor surface losses are the dominant sources of loss for AlN-on-silica
   resonators in the megahertz regime. Instead, it is suggested that charge
   redistribution loss resulting from non-uniform strain across the
   piezoelectric layer is the dominant loss mechanism, with a charge
   redistribution Q of similar to 38 000 at 5 MHz for AlN-on-silica
   devices. When all loss mechanisms are considered, the total Q is
   estimated to be 25 000, a value comparable to the measured results of
   the piezoelectric-on-silica resonators of this paper. {[}2015-0004]}},

Abstract = {{On 11-12 September 2013, portions of northern Colorado experienced flash
   flooding as a result of high rain rates accumulating over 180 mm of rain
   in 6 h. From 0400 to 0700 UTC 12 September a mesovortex was observed
   traveling northwestward toward the city of Boulder, Colorado, with
   enhanced upslope flow on its north side and localized deep convection.
   Although the mesovortex was observed in an area common for lee vortex
   formation, namely that associated with the Denver Cyclone, it is shown
   via ARW model simulations that the mesovortex intensified through the
   release of latent heat, similar to the processes leading to mesoscale
   convective vortices, rather than by dry topographic-flow dynamics. High
   rates of cloud water condensation at relatively low altitudes led to a
   strong vertical gradient in latent heating, resulting in a near-surface
   positive potential vorticity anomaly. Reducing the contribution of cloud
   water condensation to latent heating by 50\% resulted in no mesovortex
   development in the model and a substantial decrease in precipitation. On
   the other hand, removing the topographical forcing in the model did not
   inhibit the mesovortex formation, confirming the secondary role of
   topography. The mesovortex enhanced upslope winds and convection, and
   was thus a key feature in the generation of intense precipitation over
   Boulder. The ability to forecast the development of these mesovortices
   and their subsequent environmental and hydrological effects could be
   critical for decision-makers and the public, given their association
   with high rainfall rates.}},

Abstract = {{A mode transformer based on the quasi-vertical taper is designed to
   enable high coupling efficiency for interboard-level optical
   interconnects involving single-mode polymer waveguides and standard
   single-mode fibers. A triangular region fabricated above the waveguide
   is adopted to adiabatically transform the mode from the fiber into the
   polymer waveguide. The effects of the geometrical parameters of the
   taper, including width, height, tip width, etc., on the coupling
   efficiency are numerically investigated. Based on this, a quasi-vertical
   taper for the polymer rib waveguide system is designed, fabricated, and
   characterized. Coupling losses of 1.79 +/- 0.30 and 2.23 +/- 0.31 dB per
   coupler for the quasi-TM and quasi-TE mode, respectively, are measured
   across the optical communication C and L bands (1535 to 1610 nm).
   Low-cost packaging, leading to widespread utilization of polymeric
   photonic devices, is envisioned for optical interconnect applications.

Abstract = {{The following manuscript presents a novel approach for creating lattice
   based models of Sb-doped Si directly from atom probe reconstructions for
   the purposes of improving information on dopant positioning and directly
   informing quantum mechanics based materials modeling approaches.
   Sophisticated crystallographic analysis techniques are used to detect
   latent crystal structure within the atom probe reconstructions with
   unprecedented accuracy. A distortion correction algorithm is then
   developed to precisely calibrate the detected crystal structure to the
   theoretically known diamond cubic lattice. The reconstructed atoms are
   then positioned on their most likely lattice positions. Simulations are
   then used to determine the accuracy of such an approach and show that
   improvements to short-range order measurements are possible for noise
   levels and detector efficiencies comparable with experimentally
   collected atom probe data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the principles and mechanism of a fuel-optimal
   strategy in cruising scenarios, i.e., the pulse and glide (PnG)
   operation, for road vehicles equipped with a step-gear transmission. In
   the PnG strategy, the control of the engine and the transmission
   determines the fuel-saving performance, and it is obtained by solving an
   optimal control problem (OCP). Due to a discrete gear ratio, strong
   nonlinear engine fuel characteristics, and different dynamics in the
   pulse/glide mode, the OCP is a switching nonlinear mixed-integer
   problem. This challenging problem is converted by a knotting technique
   and the Legendre pseudospectral method to a nonlinear programming
   problem, which then solves the optimal engine torque and transmission
   gear position. The optimization results show the significant fuel saving
   of the PnG operation as compared with the constant-speed cruising
   strategy. The underlying fuel-saving mechanism of the PnGstrategy is
   explained graphically. For a real-time implementation, a near-optimal
   practical rule that enables a driver and/or an automatic control system
   to fast select gear positions and engine torque profile is proposed with
   only slightly deteriorated fuel saving.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the relation between stress and deformation of
   a fibrous material that is subjected to a constant fiber creation rate

   show such behavior in certain highly collagenous tissue. The
   investigation focuses on two different constitutive hypotheses: (a)
   fibers that reassemble in an undeformed state and (b) fibers that
   reassemble in a pre-strained state that is equal to the strain state of
   the surrounding matrix. The matrix component of the material is treated
   as isotropic and hyperelastic, and its mechanical properties remain
   constant in time. Separate processes of step displacement and step load
   are considered. In each case, an initial state of homeostasis is
   disrupted by the step input. The system then evolves to a new state of
   homeostasis that can be predicted in advance. The approach to this new
   homeostasis requires the consideration of a Volterra-type integral
   equation.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of waste materials are, typically, believed to
   be more variable than natural soils; however, detailed investigations
   into the variability of these materials is generally unavailable. The
   shear wave velocity and its variation with depth and laterally for five
   different waste types has been measured and analyzed at 26 locations.
   Shear wave velocity measurements were performed using the multichannel
   analysis of surface waves (MASW) and microtremor analysis method (MAM)
   techniques. Statistical analyses were performed for these locations as
   well as locations available in the literature. Waste types tested
   include municipal solid waste (MSW) in Subtitle D landfills in Michigan,
   MSW in a bioreactor landfill, MSW incineration ash, hazardous waste,
   construction and demolition waste, and municipal water treatment sludge.
   An empirical shear wave velocity model with depth is calibrated for each
   of the various waste types. Spatial variability of shear wave velocity
   is quantified using the coefficient of variation (COY) as a function of
   depth. The COY of the shear wave velocity of these waste types was found
   to be similar to values reported in the literature for soil and rock
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{Delamination detection is challenging but vital to ensuring the safety
   of an increasing number of structures utilizing laminated composites.
   Laminated composites manufactured with nanocomposite matrices show
   incredible potential for enhanced material properties including
   electrical conductivity which can be leveraged for conductivity-based
   damage identification. Advances in nanotechnology also enable the
   development of materials engineered at micro-scales for specific
   macro-scale applications. This research capitalizes on that approach by
   exploring how micro-scale manipulation of nanofillers can bolster
   structural-scale damage identification. An equivalent resistor network
   model is developed to predict nanocomposite conductivity as a function
   of filler alignment. Next, electrical impedance tomography is employed
   to locate delamination damage. It is found that aligning nanofillers at
   an angle through the thickness of a plate markedly enhances sensitivity
   to delamination damage. This demonstrates that powerful insights can be
   gleaned from the micro-scale tailoring approach to material design to
   radically enhance structural-scale damage identification.}},

Abstract = {{To study the behavior of noble gas atoms (He, Ne and Ar) in bulk
   tungsten, new DFT-based potentials for W-He, W-Ne and W-Ar interactions
   were developed by fitting the results obtained from density functional
   theory calculations. The new potentials adopt the embedded atom method
   (EAM) formalism, and the ``s-band model{''} is used to describe the
   many-body interactions between each of the noble gas atoms and its
   neighboring W atoms. These potentials reproduce the formation energies
   of point defects and the migration barriers of single noble gas atoms.
   The simulations using these potentials successfully predict that the
   tetrahedral interstitial site is more stable than the octahedral
   interstitial site for X (= He, Ne or Ar) interstitials. Based on these
   new potentials, the binding interactions of a single X atom with the X-n
   and X-n-Vacancy clusters and the diffusion properties of X-n clusters in
   bulk W were studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The
   present results indicate that the binding energies obtained using the
   new potentials are good in agreement with the results of DFT
   calculations. The migration energies of the clusters increase with both
   the increase in the atomic radius of noble gases and the increase in the
   size of the clusters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   specimens produced by focused ion beam milling. These results are
   compared with previous electron microscopy examination of 3 mm disks

   specimen with a much higher dose specimen, both derived from a single
   reactor assembly, it has been demonstrated that the coupled
   microstructural and microchemical evolution of dislocation loops and

Title = {{High-Fidelity Hydrodynamic Shape Optimization of a 3-D Hydrofoil}},

Abstract = {{With recent advances in high-performance computing, computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) modeling has become an integral part in the engineering
   analysis and even in the design process of marine vessels and
   propulsors. In aircraft wing design, CFD has been integrated with
   numerical optimization and adjoint methods to enable high-fidelity
   aerodynamic shape optimization with respect to large numbers of design
   variables. There is a potential to use some of these techniques for
   maritime applications, but there are new challenges that need to be
   addressed to realize that potential. This work presents a solution to
   some of those challenges by developing a CFD-based hydrodynamic shape
   optimization tool that considers cavitation and a wide range of
   operating conditions. A previously developed three-dimensional
   compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver is extended
   to solve for nearly incompressible flows, using a low-speed
   preconditioner. An efficient gradient-based optimizer and the adjoint
   method are used to carry out the optimization. The modified CFD solver
   is validated and verified for a tapered NACA 0009 hydrofoil. The need
   for a large number of design variables is demonstrated by comparing the
   optimized solution obtained using different number of shape design
   variables. The results showed that at least 200 design variables are
   needed to get a converged optimal solution for the hydrofoil considered.
   The need for a high-fidelity hydrodynamic optimization tool is also
   demonstrated by comparing RANS-based optimization with Euler-based
   optimization. The results show that at high lift coefficient (C-L)
   values, the Euler-based optimization leads to a geometry that cannot
   meet the required lift at the same angle of attack as the original foil
   due to inability of the Euler solver to predict viscous effects.
   Single-point optimization studies are conducted for various target C-L
   values and compared with the geometry and performance of the original
   NACA 0009 hydrofoil, as well as with the results from a multipoint
   optimization study. A total of 210 design variables are used in the
   optimization studies. The optimized foil is found to have a much lower
   negative suction peak, and hence delayed cavitation inception, in
   addition to higher efficiency, compared to the original foil at the
   design C-L value. The results show significantly different optimal
   geometry for each C-L, which means an active morphing capability was
   needed to achieve the best possible performance for all conditions. For
   the single-point optimization, using the highest C-L as the design
   point, the optimized foil yielded the best performance at the design
   point, but the performance degraded at the off-design C-L points
   compared to the nnultipoint design. In particular, the foil optimized
   for the highest C-L showed inferior performance even compared to the
   original foil at the lowest C-L condition. On the other hand, the
   multipoint optimized hydrofoil was found to perform better than the
   original NAGA 0009 hydrofoil over the entire operation profile, where
   the overall efficiency weighted by the probability of operation at each
   C-L, is improved by 14.4\%. For the multipoint optimized foil, the
   geometry remains fixed throughout the operation profile and the overall
   efficiency was only 1.5\% lower than the hypothetical actively morphed
   foil with the optimal geometry at each C-L.
   The new methodology presented herein has the potential to improve the
   design of hydrodynamic lifting surfaces such as propulsors, hydrofoils,
   and hulls.}},

Abstract = {{The inverse Langevin function is an integral component to network models
   of rubber elasticity with networks assembled using non-Gaussian
   descriptions of chain statistics. The non-invertibility of the inverse
   Langevin often requires the implementation of approximations. A variety
   of approximant forms have been proposed, including series, rational, and
   trigonometric divided domain functions. In this work, we develop an
   error-minimizing framework for determining inverse Langevin
   approximants. This method can be generalized to approximants of
   arbitrary form, and the approximants produced through the proposed
   framework represent the error-minimized forms of the particular base
   function. We applied the error-minimizing approach to Pad, approximants,
   reducing the average and maximum relative errors admitted by the forms
   of the approximants. The error-minimization technique was extended to
   improve standard Pad, approximants by way of understanding the error
   admitted by the specific approximant and using error-correcting
   functions to minimize the residual relative error. Tailored approximants
   can also be constructed by appreciating the evaluation domain of the
   application implementing the inverse Langevin function. Using a
   non-Gaussian, eight-chain network model of rubber elasticity, we show
   how specifying locations of zero error and reducing the minimization
   domain can shrink the associated error of the approximant and eliminate
   numerical discontinuities in stress calculations at small deformations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a thermal analysis of a semi-active
   battery/supercapacitor (SC) hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which
   is used in electric vehicles (EVs), at subzero temperatures. In subzero
   temperature environments, EVs suffer a dramatic driving range loss due
   to the energy and power capability reduction of LiFePO4 batteries, as
   well as severe battery degradation due to Li plating. This will increase
   the system operation cost because the battery pack needs to be changed
   frequently. Based on a novel degradation model of LiFePO4 batteries,
   which is validated over a wide temperature range, a near-optimal energy
   management strategy of the HESS for on-line use is proposed using the
   dynamic programming (DP) approach, which minimizes the operation cost
   (the electricity and the battery fade costs) over a typical China Bus
   Drive Cycle (CBDC). The convective heating method is integrated into the
   DP process. Finally, the required heating of the HESS at subzero
   temperatures over multi-CBDC is analyzed by evaluating the system
   operation cost. Simulation results show that the heating process becomes
   increasingly necessary with increased driving range, battery price, and
   heating efficiency, as well as decreasing environment temperature. (C)

Journal = {{BONE}},

Abstract = {{The collagen cross-link profile of bone, associated with bone strength
   and fracture toughness, is tightly regulated (affecting cross-link
   quantity, type, lysine hydroxylation and maturity) and may contribute to
   the improvements in bone quality during exercise. We hypothesized that
   1) exercise promotes mature cross-link formation, 2) increased mature
   cross-linking is accompanied by shifts in lysine hydroxylation, and 3)
   these changes in collagen cross-link profile have positive effects on
   mechanical properties. Growing male C57Bl6 mice were treated with 30
   min/day of running exercise, 350 mg/kg/day beta-aminopropionitrile
   (BAPN) injected subcutaneously to inhibit enzymatic collagen
   cross-linking, or both exercise and BAPN, from 5 to 8 weeks of age. Bone
   collagen cross-linking profile, mechanical properties, morphology, and
   mineralization were measured from the tibiae. Cross-link measures,
   including immature, pyridinoline, pyrrole and pentosidine cross-links,
   ratios reflecting cross-link maturity and hydroxylation, and
   mineralization were tested for their importance to mechanical properties
   across 8 week groups through correlation analyses and step-wise linear
   regressions.
   BAPN treatment significantly reduced lysylpyridinoline, pyrrole,
   hydroxylysinorleucine, and total mature collagen cross-linking,
   resulting in decreased bone elastic modulus and increased yield strain
   despite a marginal increase in TMD. Exercise caused a shift toward
   pyridinoline cross-linking, with increased hydroxylysylpyridinoline and
   decreased pyrrole cross-linking resulting in total mature cross-linking
   and estimated tissue level mechanical properties matching sedentary
   control levels. Exercise superimposed on BAPN treatment increased total
   mature cross-linking from BAPN to control levels, but did so by
   increasing pyridinoline, not pyrrole, cross-links. Exercise also
   counteracted the BAPN effects on modulus and strain, without a change in
   TMD. Pyrrole cross-linking was the strongest correlate of modulus (r =
   0.470, p < 0.01) and yield strain (r = -0.467, p < 0.01). Cross-links
   with similar levels of telopeptide lysine hydroxylation to pyrrole
   (lysylpyridinoline and hydroxylysinorleucine) also correlated with
   modulus and strain to a lesser extent. In conclusion, exercise in
   growing mice promotes pyridinoline collagen cross-linking in bone, the
   resulting increase in total mature cross-linking is sufficient to
   counteract the mechanical effects of concurrent cross-link inhibition,
   and this responsiveness to loading is a potential means by which
   exercise might improve bone quality in diseased or otherwise compromised
   bone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},
