Abstract = {{We derive an exact, simple relation between the average number of
   clusters and the wrapping probabilities for two-dimensional percolation.
   The relation holds for periodic lattices of any size. It generalizes a
   classical result of Sykes and Essam, and it can be used to find exact or
   very accurate approximations of the critical density. The criterion that
   follows is related to the criterion used by Scullard and Jacobsen to
   find precise approximate thresholds, and our work provides a different
   perspective on their approach.}},

Abstract = {{Release testing of parental controlled release microspheres is an
   essential step in controlling quality and predicting the duration of
   efficacy. In the first of a two-part study, we examined the effect of
   various incubation media on release from leuprolide-loaded PLGA
   microspheres to understand the influence of external pH, plasticization,
   and buffer type on mechanism of accelerated release. PLGA 50/50
   microspheres encapsulating similar to 5\% w/w leuprolide were prepared
   by the double emulsion-solvent evaporation method with or without
   gelatin or by the self-healing encapsulation method. The microspheres
   were incubated at 37 degrees C up to 56 days in various media: pH 5.5,
   6.5, and 7.4 phosphate buffered-saline (PBS) containing 0.02\% Tween 80;
   pH 7.4 PBS containing 1.0\% triethyl citrate (PBStc); and pH 7.4 HEPES
   buffered-saline containing 0.02\% Tween 80 (all media contained 0.02\%
   sodium azide). The recovered release media and microspheres were
   examined for released drug, polymer molecular weight (Mw), water uptake,
   mass loss, and BODIPY (green-fluorescent dye) diffusion coefficient in
   PLGA. After the initial burst release, release of leuprolide from
   acid-capped PLGA microspheres appeared to be controlled initially by
   erosion and then by a second mechanism after day 21, which likely
   consists of a combination of peptide desorption and/or water-mediated
   breakage of pore connections. PBStc and acidic buffers accelerated
   degradation of PLGA and pore-network development and increased BODIPY
   diffusion coefficient, resulting in faster release. Release of
   leuprolide from the end-capped PLGA showed similar trends as found with
   acid capped PLGA but with a longer lag time before release. These data
   provide a baseline mechanistic signature of in vitro release of
   leuprolide for future comparison with corresponding in vivo performance,
   and in turn could lead to future development of rational in vitro-in
   vivo correlations. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate assessment of erosion rates remains an elusive problem because
   soil loss is strongly nonunique with respect to the main drivers. In
   addressing the mechanistic causes of erosion responses, we discriminate
   between macroscale effects of external factors-long studied and referred
   to as ``geomorphic external variability{''}, and microscale effects,
   introduced as ``geomorphic internal variability.{''} The latter source
   of erosion variations represents the knowledge gap, an overlooked but
   vital element of geomorphic response, significantly impacting the low
   predictability skill of deterministic models at field-catchment scales.
   This is corroborated with experiments using a comprehensive physical
   model that dynamically updates the soil mass and particle composition.
   As complete knowledge of microscale conditions for arbitrary location
   and time is infeasible, we propose that new predictive frameworks of
   soil erosion should embed stochastic components in deterministic
   assessments of external and internal types of geomorphic variability.}},

Abstract = {{Into an extended Voorn-Overbeek (EVO) free energy model of
   polyelectrolyte (PE) complexation and phase behavior, we incorporate
   three classes of short-ranged electrostatic effects, namely counterion
   association dissociation, cross-chain ion pairing (IP), and charge
   regulation by treating each as a reversible chemical reaction leading to
   a corresponding law of mass action in a self-consistent fashion. The
   importance of each reaction is controlled by a corresponding chemistry
   dependent standard free energy input parameter. Our model also accounts
   for Born (or ion solvation) energy using a linear mixing rule for the
   effective dielectric constant. In monophasic systems, the proposed model
   can qualitatively explain the observed shifts in acidity and basicity
   observed in potentiometric titration of weak PEs in the presence of salt
   and oppositely charged PEs in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle.
   We demonstrate how a competition between counterion condensation (CC)
   and IP alone can explain the complex coacervation of strongly charged
   PEs as well as the existence of a critical salt concentration. Binodal
   diagrams predicted in our model are also affected by long-ranged
   electrostatics and are most sensitive to IP strength both for weak and
   strong PEs. The extent of IP increases in the dense phase at the expense
   of reduced CC upon coacervation consistent with counter release view of
   complex coacervation. We compare binodal diagrams predicted by our model
   against experimental data for both weakly and strongly dissociating
   polyions pairs and find a plausible parameter set that leads to an
   acceptable and partial agreement with experiments in the two cases,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The name ``plume{''} has been given to a variety of plasma structures in
   the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere. Some plumes (such as the
   plasmasphere plume) represent elevated plasma density, while other
   plumes (such as the equatorial F region plume) represent low-density
   regions. Despite these differences these structures are either directly
   related or connected in the causal chain of plasma redistribution
   throughout the system. This short review defines how plumes appear in
   different measurements in different regions and describes how plumes can
   be used to understand magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. The story of
   the plume family helps describe the emerging conceptual framework of the
   flow of high-density-low-latitude ionospheric plasma into the
   magnetosphere and clearly shows that strong two-way coupling between
   ionospheric and magnetospheric dynamics occurs not only in the
   high-latitude auroral zone and polar cap but also through the
   plasmasphere. The paper briefly reviews, highlights and synthesizes
   previous studies that have contributed to this new understanding.}},

Abstract = {{New approaches in molecular nanoscopy are greatly desired for
   interrogation of biological, organic, and inorganic objects with sizes
   below the diffraction limit. Our current work investigates emergent
   monolayer-protected gold quantum dots (nanoclusters, NCs) composed of 25
   Au atoms by utilizing two photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF) near-field
   scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) at single NC concentrations. Here, we
   demonstrate an approach to synthesize and isolate single NCs on solid
   glass substrates. Subsequent investigation of the NCs using TPEF NSOM
   reveals that, even when they are separated by distances of several tens
   of nanometers, we can excite and interrogate single NCs individually.
   Interestingly, we observe an enhanced two-photon absorption (TPA) cross
   section for single Au-25 NCs that can be attributed to few atom local
   field effects and to local field-induced microscopic cascading,
   indicating their potential for use in ultrasensitive sensing, disease
   diagnostics, cancer cell therapy, and molecular computers. Finally, we
   report room-temperature aperture based TPEF NSOM imaging of these NCs
   for the first time at 30 nm point resolution, which is a similar to
   5-fold improvement compared to the previous best result for the same
   technique. This report unveils the unique combination of an unusually
   large TPA cross section and the high photostability of Au NCs to
   (non-destructively) investigate stable isolated single NCs using TPEF
   NSOM. This is the first reported optical study of monolayer-protected
   single quantum clusters, opening some very promising opportunities in
   spectroscopy of nanosized objects, bioimaging, ultrasensitive sensing,
   molecular computers, and high density data storage.}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( AF) by fast rotors in
   the left atrium ( LA) or at the pulmonary veins ( PVs) is not fully
   understood. This review describes the role of the heterogeneous
   distribution of transmembrane currents in the PVs and LA junction (
   PV-LAJ) in the localization of rotors in the PVs. Experimentally
   observed heterogeneities in I-K1, I-Ks, I-Kr, I-to, and I-CaL in the
   PV-LAJ were incorporated into models of human atrial kinetics to
   simulate various conditions and investigate rotor drifting mechanisms.
   Spatial gradients in the currents resulted in shorter action potential
   duration, less negative minimum diastolic potential, slower upstroke and
   conduction velocity for rotors in the PV region than in the LA. Rotors
   under such conditions drifted toward the PV and stabilized at the less
   excitable region. Our simulations suggest that I-K1 heterogeneity is
   dominant in determining the drift direction through its impact on the
   excitability gradient. These results provide a novel framework for
   understanding the complex dynamics of rotors in AF.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally believed that Voyager 1 (V1) is now in interstellar
   space, having crossed the heliopause at a heliocentric distance of
   121.58 au in late August of 2012. Here we use recently published spectra
   of energetic neutral hydrogen, and the magnetic field and energetic
   particles directly measured by V1 to find the average pressure in the
   inner heliosheath (termination shock to 122 au). This pressure turns out
   to be surprisingly large, (3.57 +/- 0.71) x 10(-12) dyn cm(-2), and is
   completely dominated by pressures of pickup ions (PUIs), created in the
   inner heliosheath, and their suprathermal tails (43\%), and PUIs and
   their tails that are produced upstream of the termination shock and
   enter the heliosheath (46\%). We compute the total particle pressure in
   the outer heliosheath near the heliopause from distribution functions of
   the interstellar plasma and locally created PUIs using profiles of
   proton density, proton temperature, and neutral hydrogen density from
   model 2 in Zank et al., and find it to be at most 7.7 x 10(-13) dyn
   cm(-2). Balancing pressure across the heliopause, thus requires an
   unusually large magnetic pressure (2.8 x 10(-12) dyn cm(-2)). The
   resulting strength and 1 sigma uncertainty of the draped magnetic field
   in the outer heliosheath near the heliopause is 0.839 +/- 0.106 nT. The
   3 sigma lower limit field strength (0.52 nT) is greater than the field
   of similar to 0.43 +/- 0.02 nT measured by V1, implying that there is
   less than 1\% probability that V1 is measuring the interstellar draped
   field.}},

Title = {{A NEW 3D MULTI-FLUID MODEL: A STUDY OF KINETIC EFFECTS AND VARIATIONS OF
   PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN THE COMETARY COMA}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{Physics-based numerical coma models are desirable whether to interpret
   the spacecraft observations of the inner coma or to compare with the
   ground-based observations of the outer coma. In this work, we develop a
   multineutral-fluid model based on the BATS-R-US code of the University
   of Michigan, which is capable of computing both the inner and outer coma
   and simulating time-variable phenomena. It treats H2O, OH, H-2, O, and H
   as separate fluids and each fluid has its own velocity and temperature,
   with collisions coupling all fluids together. The self-consistent
   collisional interactions decrease the velocity differences,
   re-distribute the excess energy deposited by chemical reactions among
   all species, and account for the varying heating efficiency under
   various physical conditions. Recognizing that the fluid approach has
   limitations in capturing all of the correct physics for certain
   applications, especially for very low density environment, we applied
   our multi-fluid coma model to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko at various
   heliocentric distances and demonstrated that it yields comparable
   results to the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) model, which is
   based on a kinetic approach that is valid under these conditions.
   Therefore, our model may be a powerful alternative to the particle-based
   model, especially for some computationally intensive simulations. In
   addition, by running the model with several combinations of production
   rates and heliocentric distances, we characterize the cometary H2O
   expansion speeds and demonstrate the nonlinear dependencies of
   production rate and heliocentric distance. Our results are also compared
   to previous modeling work and remote observations, which serve as
   further validation of our model.}},

Abstract = {{RNA carries the genetic instructions for many viruses to replicate in
   their host cells. The photochemical reactions that take place in RNA and
   affect viral infectivity in natural and engineered environments,
   however, remain poorly understood. We exposed RNA oligomer segments from
   the genome of bacteriophage MS2 to UV254, simulated sunlight, and
   singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and analyzed the oligomer reaction kinetics with
   reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and quantitative
   matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
   mass spectrometry (MS). Following UV254 exposure, quantitative
   MALDI-TOF-MS detected significantly more RNA modifications than did
   RT-qPCR, suggesting that certain chemical modifications in the RNA were
   not detected by the reverse transcriptase enzyme. In contrast,
   MALDI-TOF-MS tracked as much O-1(2)-induced RNA damage as RT-qPCR. After
   5 h of simulated sunlight exposure (5100 J/m(2) UVB and 1.2 x 10(5)
   J/m(2) UVA), neither MALDI-TOF-MS nor RT-qPCR detected significant
   decreases in the oligomer concentrations. High-resolution electrospray
   ionization (ESI)-Orbitrap MS analyses identified pyrimidine
   photohydrates as the major UV254 products, which likely contributed to
   the discrepancy between the MS- and RT-qPCR-based results. Reactions
   between RNA oligomers and O-1(2) resulted in an unidentified major
   product with a mass change of +6 Da. These results shed light on the
   photochemical reactions that take place in RNA and suggest that the
   analytical techniques used to detect RNA reactivity could bias the
   observed reaction kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{We present a high angular tolerant structural coloration based on strong
   interference effects in a nanocavity patterned at a subwavelength scale
   on a flexible substrate. The structural colors, fabricated over a large
   area by nanoimprint lithography, feature a non-iridescent performance
   over a wide angle of incidence up to 60 degrees, which is of great
   importance to various applications, such as imaging sensors and colored
   display systems. In addition to the non-iridescence, the transmissive
   colors of the proposed structure, simply consisting of triple layers,
   can be tuned with ease by altering a duty cycle of nanostructures, thus
   enabling the creation of individual RGB colors in a pixel unit via a
   facile one-step approach. Moreover, it is confirmed that their
   performances remain unchanged to the 10 mm bending radius condition, and
   the encapsulation effects of a polymer material on their optical
   properties are investigated for practical usage. The presented strategy
   could provide a new avenue for achieving improved efficiency and desired
   functionality, thereby opening the door to many potential applications,
   including anti-counterfeit tagging, imaging sensor systems, and color
   e-paper displays. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Device architectures based on the two-dimensional material graphene can
   be used for sensing of electromagnetic and particle radiation. The
   sensing mechanism may be direct, by absorbance of radiation by the
   graphene or the immediately adjacent material, and indirect, via the
   field effect principle, whereby the change in conductivity within a
   semiconducting absorber substrate induces electric field change at
   graphene. Here, we report on a graphene field effect transistor (GFET)
   sensitive to heavy charged particle radiation (a particles) at MeV
   energies by use of the indirect sensing mechanism. Both the continuous
   and discrete changes of graphene are observed, and the latter are
   attributed to single a particle interactions with the GFET. While this
   study provides the basis for understanding of the irradiation effects,
   it also opens prospects for the use of GFETs as heavy charged particle
   detectors. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Smallpox holds a unique position in the history of medicine. It was the
   first disease for which a vaccine was developed and remains the only
   human disease eradicated by vaccination. Although there have been claims
   of smallpox in Egypt, India, and China dating back millennia {[}1-4],
   the timescale of emergence of the causative agent, variola virus (VARV),
   and how it evolved in the context of increasingly widespread
   immunization, have proven controversial {[}4-9]. In particular, some
   molecular-clock-based studies have suggested that key events in VARV
   evolution only occurred during the last two centuries {[}4-6] and hence
   in apparent conflict with anecdotal historical reports, although it is
   difficult to distinguish smallpox from other pustular rashes by
   description alone. To address these issues, we captured, sequenced, and
   reconstructed a draft genome of an ancient strain of VARV, sampled from
   a Lithuanian child mummy dating between 1643 and 1665 and close to the
   time of several documented European epidemics {[}1, 2, 10]. When
   compared to vaccinia virus, this archival strain contained the same
   pattern of gene degradation as 20th century VARVs, indicating that such
   loss of gene function had occurred before ca. 1650. Strikingly, the
   mummy sequence fell basal to all currently sequenced strains of VARV on
   phylogenetic trees. Molecular-clock analyses revealed a strong
   clock-like structure and that the timescale of smallpox evolution is
   more recent than often supposed, with the diversification of major viral
   lineages only occurring within the 18th and 19th centuries, concomitant
   with the development of modern vaccination.}},

Title = {{Macrophages Enhance Migration in Inflammatory Breast Cancer Cells via
   RhoC GTPase Signaling}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most lethal form of breast
   cancer. All IBC patients have lymph node involvement and one-third of
   patients already have distant metastasis at diagnosis. This propensity
   for metastasis is a hallmark of IBC distinguishing it from less lethal
   non-inflammatory breast cancers (nIBC). Genetic profiling studies have
   been conducted to differentiate IBC from nIBC, but no IBC
   cancer-cell-specific gene signature has been identified. We hypothesized
   that a tumorextrinsic factor, notably tumor-associated macrophages,
   promotes and contributes to IBC's extreme metastatic phenotype. To this
   end, we studied the effect of macrophage-conditioned media (MCM) on IBC.
   We show that two IBC cell lines are hyper-responsive to MCM as compared
   to normal-like breast and aggressive nIBC cell lines. We further
   interrogated IBC's hyper-responsiveness to MCM using a microfluidic
   migration device, which permits individual cell migration path tracing.
   We found the MCM ``primes{''} the IBC cells' cellular machinery to
   become extremely migratory in response to a chemoattractant. We
   determined that interleukins -6, -8, and -10 within the MCM are
   sufficient to stimulate this enhanced IBC migration effect, and that the
   known metastatic oncogene, RhoC GTPase, is necessary for the enhanced
   migration response.}},

Abstract = {{The Magnetospheric Multiscale mission (MMS) consists of four identical
   spacecraft forming a closely separated (10km) and nearly regular
   tetrahedron. This configuration enables the decoupling of spatial and
   temporal variations and allows the calculation of the spatial gradients
   of plasma and electromagnetic field quantities. We make full use of the
   well cross-calibrated MMS magnetometers and fast plasma instruments
   measurements to calculate both the magnetic and plasma forces in flux
   transfer events (FTEs) and evaluate the relative contributions of
   different forces to the magnetopause momentum variation. This analysis
   demonstrates that some but not all FTEs, consistent with previous
   studies, are indeed force-free structures in which the magnetic pressure
   force balances the magnetic curvature force. Furthermore, we contrast
   these events with FTE events that have non-force-free signatures.}},

Abstract = {{The FORCAsT canopy exchange model was used to investigate the underlying
   mechanisms governing foliage emissions of methanol and acetaldehyde, two
   short chain oxygenated volatile organic compounds ubiquitous in the
   troposphere and known to have strong biogenic sources, at a northern
   mid-latitude forest site. The explicit representation of the vegetation
   canopy within the model allowed us to test the hypothesis that stomatal
   conductance regulates emissions of these compounds to an extent that its
   influence is observable at the ecosystem scale, a process not currently
   considered in regional-or global-scale atmospheric chemistry models.
   We found that FORCAsT could only reproduce the magnitude and diurnal
   profiles of methanol and acetaldehyde fluxes measured at the top of the
   forest canopy at Harvard Forest if light-dependent emissions were
   introduced to the model. With the inclusion of such emissions, FORCAsT
   was able to successfully simulate the observed bidirectional exchange of
   methanol and acetaldehyde. Although we found evidence that stomatal
   conductance influences methanol fluxes and concentrations at scales
   beyond the leaf level, particularly at dawn and dusk, we were able to
   adequately capture ecosystem exchange without the addition of stomatal
   control to the standard parameterisations of foliage emissions,
   suggesting that ecosystem fluxes can be well enough represented by the
   emissions models currently used.}},

Abstract = {{Wire mesh sensors (WMS) are state of the art devices that allow high
   resolution (in space and time) measurement of 2D void fraction
   distribution over a wide range of two-phase flow regimes, from bubbly to
   annular. Data using WMS have been recorded at the Helmholtz-Zentrum
   Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) (Lucas et al., 2010; Beyer et al., 2008;
   Prasser et al., 2003) for a wide combination of superficial gas and
   liquid velocities, providing an excellent database for advances in
   two-phase flow modeling.
   In two-phase flow, the interfacial area plays an integral role in
   coupling the mass, momentum and energy transport equations of the liquid
   and gas phase. While current models used in best-estimate
   thermal-hydraulic codes (e.g. RELAP5, TRACE, TRACG, etc.) are still
   based on algebraic correlations for the estimation of the interfacial
   area in different flow regimes, interfacial area transport equations
   (IATE) have been proposed to predict the dynamic propagation in space
   and time of interfacial area (Ishii and Hibiki, 2010). IATE models are
   still under development and the HZDR WMS experimental data provide an
   excellent basis for the validation and further advance of these models.
   The current paper is focused on the uncertainty analysis of algorithms
   used to reconstruct interfacial area densities from the void-fraction
   voxel data measured using WMS and their application towards validation
   efforts of two-group IATE models.
   In previous research efforts, a surface triangularization algorithm has
   been developed in order to estimate the surface area of individual
   bubbles recorded with the WMS, and estimate the interfacial area in the
   given flow condition. In the present paper, synthetically generated
   bubbles are used to assess the algorithm's accuracy. As the interfacial
   area of the synthetic bubbles are defined by user inputs, the error
   introduced by the algorithm can be quantitatively obtained. The accuracy
   of interfacial area measurements is characterized for different bubbles
   sizes and shapes, and for different WMS acquisition frequencies. It is
   found that while convex shapes are successfully analyzed by the
   reconstruction algorithm, some difficulties are faced with bubbles
   presenting internal cavities.
   Utilizing the experimental HZDR database, the performance of the current
   two-group IATE model is evaluated. While the qualitative propagation of
   interfacial area is predicted sufficiently well, there is a discrepancy
   in magnitude between the model's prediction and the experimental
   results. Overall, the study suggests that differences exist in the
   incidence of interaction mechanisms between small and large diameter
   pipes and further efforts are needed in order to extend the range of
   validity of current IATE models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Cubic spinel Li1+xTi2O4 is a promising electrode material because it
   exhibits a high lithium diffusivity and undergoes minimal changes in
   lattice parameters during lithiation and delithiation, thereby ensuring
   favorable cyclability. The present work is a multiphysics and multiscale
   study of Li1+xTi2O4 that combines first-principles computations of
   thermodynamic and kinetic properties with continuum scale modeling of
   lithiationdelithiation kinetics. Density functional theory calculations
   and statistical mechanics methods are used to calculate lattice
   parameters, elastic coefficients, thermodynamic potentials, migration
   barriers, and Li diffusion coefficients. These computations were
   performed at a temperature of 800 K to magnify the kinetic effects.
   These quantities then inform a phase field framework to model the
   coupled chemo-mechanical evolution of electrode particles. Several case
   studies accounting for either homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation
   are considered to explore the temporal evolution of maximum principal
   stress values, which serve to indicate stress localization and the
   potential for crack initiation, during lithiation and delithiation.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A grand challenge in material science is to understand the correlation
   between intrinsic properties and defect dynamics. Radiation tolerant
   materials are in great demand for safe operation and advancement of
   nuclear and aerospace systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely
   on microstructural and nanoscale features to mitigate radiation damage,
   this study demonstrates enhancement of radiation tolerance with the
   suppression of void formation by two orders magnitude at elevated
   temperatures in equiatomic single-phase concentrated solid solution
   alloys, and more importantly, reveals its controlling mechanism through
   a detailed analysis of the depth distribution of defect clusters and an
   atomistic computer simulation. The enhanced swelling resistance is
   attributed to the tailored interstitial defect cluster motion in the
   alloys from a long-range one-dimensional mode to a short-range
   three-dimensional mode, which leads to enhanced point defect
   recombination. The results suggest design criteria for next generation
   radiation tolerant structural alloys.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{751-758}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Electricity trade among power grids leads to difficulties in measuring
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emission factors of purchased electricity.
   Traditional methods assume either electricity purchased from a grid is
   entirely produced locally (Boundary I) or imported electricity is
   entirely produced by the exporting grid (Boundary II) (in fact a blend
   of electricity produced by many grids). Both methods ignore the fact
   that electricity can be indirectly traded between grids. Failing to
   capture such indirect electricity trade can underestimate or
   overestimate GHG emissions of purchased electricity in interconnected
   grid networks, potentially leading to incorrectly accounting for the
   effects of emission reduction policies involving purchased electricity.
   We propose a ``Boundary III{''} framework to account for emissions both
   directly and indirectly caused by purchased electricity in
   interconnected gird networks. We use three case studies on a national
   grid network, an Eurasian Continent grid network, and North Europe grid
   network to demonstrate the proposed Boundary III emission factors. We
   found that the difference on GHG emissions of purchased electricity
   estimated using different emission factors can be considerably large. We
   suggest to standardize the choice of different emission factors based on
   how interconnected the local grid is with other grids. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we aim to design the optimal sensor collaboration
   strategy for the estimation of time-varying parameters, where
   collaboration refers to the act of sharing measurements with neighboring
   sensors prior to transmission to a fusion center. We begin by addressing
   the sensor collaboration problem for the estimation of uncorrelated
   parameters. We show that the resulting collaboration problem can be
   transformed into a special nonconvex optimization problem, where a
   difference of convex functions carries all the nonconvexity. This
   specific problem structure enables the use of a convex-concave procedure
   to obtain a near-optimal solution. When the parameters of interest are
   temporally correlated, a penalized version of the convex-concave
   procedure becomes well suited for designing the optimal collaboration
   scheme. In order to improve computational efficiency, we further propose
   a fast algorithm that scales gracefully with problem size via the
   alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical results are
   provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and the impact
   of parameter correlation and temporal dynamics of sensor networks on
   estimation performance.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive gas pulse (RGP) sputtering approach was used to prepare TiN
   thin films through periodically changing the N-2/Ar gas flow ratio. The
   obtained RGP-TiN film possessed a hybrid architecture containing
   compositionally graded and multilayered structures, composed of hcp
   Ti-phase and fcc TiN-phase sublayers. Meanwhile, the RGP-TiN film
   exhibited a composition-oscillation along the film thickness direction,
   where the Ti-phase sublayer had a compositional gradient and the
   TiN-phase retained a constant stoichiometric ratio of Ti:N approximate
   to 1. The film modulation ratio lambda (the thicknesses ratio of the Ti
   and TiN-phase sublayer) can be effectively tuned by controlling the
   undulation behavior of the N-2 partial flow rate. Detailed analysis
   showed that this hybrid structure originated from a periodic transition
   of the film growth mode during the reactive sputtering process. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that longwave (LW) spectral fluxes have
   unique merit in climate studies. Using Atmospheric Infrared Sounder
   (AIRS) radiances as a case study, this study presents an algorithm to
   derive the entire LW clear-sky spectral fluxes from spaceborne
   hyperspectral observations. No other auxiliary observations are needed
   in the algorithm. A clear-sky scene is identified using a three-step
   detection method. The identified clear-sky scenes are then categorized
   into different sub-scene types using information about precipitable
   water, lapse rate and surface temperature inferred from the AIRS
   radiances at six selected channels. A previously established algorithm
   is then used to invert AIRS radiances to spectral fluxes over the entire
   LW spectrum at 10 cm 1 spectral interval. Accuracy of the algorithms is
   evaluated against collocated Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy
   System (CERES) observations. For nadir-view observations, the mean
   difference between outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) derived by this
   algorithm and the collocated CERES OLR is 1.52 Wm(-2) with a standard
   deviation of 2.46 Wm(-2). When the algorithm is extended for viewing
   zenith angle up to 45 degrees, the performance is comparable to that for
   nadir-view results.}},

Abstract = {{Here, a simple zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle sizing is reported for
   aramid fibers that simultaneously provides interfacial reinforcement and
   UV absorption to develop improved fiber-reinforced composites. Through a
   one-step nanoparticle deposition, the modified aramid fiber showed an
   increase in interfacial shear strength of 18.9\% with the addition of
   ZnO nanoparticles when tested by single-fiber pullout. The aramid fibers
   were then treated with a hydrolysis process common to aramid fibers to
   oxidize the surface and elucidate the importance of oxygen functional
   groups at the interface. These oxidized fibers proved to further enhance
   the interface between the fiber surface and nanoparticle, leading to a
   33.3\% increase relative to the bare fiber. Additionally, due to the
   absorption properties of ZnO, the retainment of mechanical properties of
   coated fibers was determined after exposure to an artificial UV light
   source. After 24 h of exposure, fibers coated with ZnO nanoparticles
   retained 25\% more tensile strength and 21\% more modulus than uncoated
   bare fibers. This work shows that ZnO nanoparticles may serve as a
   novel, yet simple, multifunctional fiber sizing with which to increase
   the interfacial strength of aramid fiber composites and improve the
   resistance to UV irradiation, enabling stronger and more-durable
   structural fiber composites.}},

Abstract = {{Rapidly evolving fields of biomedical, energy, and (opto) electronic
   devices bring forward the need for deformable conductors with constantly
   rising benchmarks for mechanical properties and electronic conductivity.
   The search for conductors with improved strength and strain have
   inspired the multiple studies of nanocomposites and amorphous metals.
   However, finding conductors that defy the boundaries of classical
   materials and exhibit simultaneously high strength, toughness, and fast
   charge transport while enabling their scalable production, remains a
   difficult materials engineering challenge. Here, composites made from
   aramid nanofibers (ANFs) and gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) that offer a
   new toolset for engineering high strength flexible conductors are
   described. ANFs are derived from Kevlar macrofibers and retain their
   strong mechanical properties and temperature resilience. Au NPs are
   infiltrated into a porous, free-standing aramid matrix, becoming aligned
   on ANFs, which reduces the charge percolation threshold and facilitates
   charge transport. Further thermal annealing at 300 degrees C results in
   the Au-ANF composites with an electrical conductivity of 1.25 x 10(4) S
   cm(-1) combined with a tensile strength of 96 MPa, a Young's modulus of
   5.29 GPa, and a toughness of 1.3 MJ m(-3). These para-meters exceed
   those of most of the composite materials, and are comparable to those of
   amorphous metals but have no volume limitations. The plasmonic optical
   frequencies characteristic for constituent NPs are present in the
   composites with ANFs enabling plasmon-based optoelectronic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Single-phase samples of the solid-solution series FeSb2-xInxSe4 (0 <= x
   <= 0.25) were synthesized using solid-state reaction of the elements to
   probe the effect of electronic structure engineering on the magnetic
   behavior of the p-type semiconductor, FeSb2Se4. Powder X-ray diffraction
   data suggest that all samples are isostructural with FeSb2Se4. Rietveld
   refinements of the distribution of In atoms at various metal positions
   indicate a preferential substitution of Sb at the M1(4i) position within
   the magnetic layer A for In concentration up to x = 0.1. FeSb2-xInxSe4
   compositions with higher In content show the distribution of In atoms at
   all metal positions, except for the M3(2d), which is fully occupied by
   Fe atoms. Interestingly, the ordering of Fe atoms within the crystal
   structure of FeSb2-xInxSe4 remains essentially unaffected by the degree
   of substitution (x values) and is comparable to the distribution of Fe
   atoms reported in FeSb2Se4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms
   the oxidation states of various metal atoms In(+3), Sb(+3), Fe(+2) in
   the structure. Electronic transport properties indicate p-type
   semiconducting behavior for all samples. The electrical conductivity
   above 300 K first increases with In content, reaches the maximum value
   for x = 0.1, then decreases with further increase in In content. A
   reverse trend is observed for the thermopower. All samples show
   drastically low thermal conductivity with room temperature values
   ranging from 0.45 Wm(-1) K-1 for x = 0 to 0.27 Wm(-1) K-1 for the sample
   with x = 0.25. Magnetic susceptibility data suggest ferromagnetic-like
   behavior from 2-300 K for all samples. The magnitude of the magnetic
   susceptibility rapidly increases with In content, reaches a maximum for
   x = 0.1, and marginally decreases with further increase in In
   concentration. The observed surprising change in the magnetic and
   electronic behavior of samples with high In content (x > 0.1) is
   rationalized using the concept of antiferromagnetic scattering of charge
   carriers at the interfaces between overlapping bound magnetic polarons
   from adjacent layers A and B.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method of modeling nanoparticle (NP) hydrophobicity using
   coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG MD) simulations, and apply this to
   the interaction of lipids with nanoparticles. To model at a
   coarse-grained level the wettability or hydrophobicity of a given
   material, we choose the MARTINI coarse-grained force field, and
   determine through simulation the contact angles of MARTINI water
   droplets residing on flat regular surfaces composed of various MARTINI
   bead types (C1, C2, etc.). Each surface is composed of a single bead
   type in each of three crystallographic symmetries (FCC, BCC, and HCP).
   While this method lumps together several atoms (for example, one cerium
   and two oxygen of CeO2) into a single CG bead, we can still capture the
   overall hydrophobicity of the actual material by choosing the MARTINI
   bead type that gives the best fit of the contact angle to that of the
   actual material, as determined by either experimental or all-atom
   simulations. For different MARTINI bead types, the macroscopic contact
   angle is obtained by extrapolating the microscopic contact angles of
   droplets of eight different sizes (containing N-w = 3224-22978 water
   molecules) to infinite droplet size. For each droplet, the contact angle
   was computed from a best fit of a circular curve to the droplet
   interface extrapolated to the first layer of the surface. We then
   examine how small nanoparticles of differing wettability interact with
   MARTINI dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine (DPPC) lipids and SP-C peptides
   (a component of lung surfactant). The DPPC shows a transition from tails
   coating the nanoparticle to a hemimicelle coating the water-wet NP, as
   the contact angle of a water droplet on the surface is lowered below
   similar to 60 degrees. The results are relevant to developing a taxonomy
   describing the potential nanotoxicity of nanoparticle interactions with
   components in the lung.}},

Abstract = {{Frank-Kasper (F-K) and quasicrystal phases were originally identified in
   metal alloys and only sporadically reported in soft materials. These
   unconventional sphere-packing schemes open up possibilities to design
   materials with different properties. The challenge in soft materials is
   how to correlate complex phases built from spheres with the tunable
   parameters of chemical composition and molecular architecture. Here, we
   report a complete sequence of various highly ordered mesophases by the
   self-assembly of specifically designed and synthesized giant
   surfactants, which are conjugates of hydrophilic polyhedral oligomeric
   silsesquioxane cages tethered with hydrophobic polystyrene tails. We
   show that the occurrence of these mesophases results from nanophase
   separation between the heads and tails and thus is critically dependent
   on molecular geometry. Variations in molecular geometry achieved by
   changing the number of tails from one to four not only shift
   compositional phase boundaries but also stabilize F-K and quasicrystal
   phases in regions where simple phases of spheroidal micelles are
   typically observed. These complex self-assembled nanostructures have
   been identified by combining X-ray scattering techniques and real-space
   electron microscopy images. Brownian dynamics simulations based on a
   simplified molecular model confirm the architecture-induced sequence of
   phases. Our results demonstrate the critical role of molecular
   architecture in dictating the formation of supramolecular crystals with
   ``soft{''} spheroidal motifs and provide guidelines to the design of
   unconventional self-assembled nanostructures.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Investigations of invisibility cloaks have been led by rigorous theories
   and such cloak structures, in general, require extreme material
   parameters. Consequently, it is challenging to realize them,
   particularly in the full visible region. Due to the insensitivity of
   human eyes to the polarization and phase of light, cloaking a large
   object in the full visible region has been recently realized by a
   simplified theory. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a device concept
   where a large object can be concealed in a cloak structure and at the
   same time any images can be projected through it by utilizing a
   distinctively different approach; the cloaking via one polarization and
   the image projection via the other orthogonal polarization. Our device
   structure consists of commercially available optical components such as
   polarizers and mirrors, and therefore, provides a significant further
   step towards practical application scenarios such as transparent devices
   and see-through displays.}},

Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{We present the theoretical and experimental results for the electronic
   and optical properties of atomically thin (1 and 2 monolayers) GaN
   quantum wells with AlN barriers. Strong quantum confinement increases
   the gap of GaN to as high as 5.44 eV and enables light emission in the
   deep-UV range. Luminescence occurs from the heavy and light hole bands
   of GaN yielding E perpendicular to c polarized light emission. Strong
   confinement also increases the exciton binding energy up to 230 meV,
   preventing a thermal dissociation of excitons at room temperature.
   However, we did not observe excitons experimentally due to high excited
   free-carrier concentrations. Monolayer-thick GaN wells also exhibit a
   large electron-hole wave function overlap and negligible Stark shift,
   which is expected to enhance the radiative recombination efficiency. Our
   results indicate that atomically thin GaN/AlN heterostructures are
   promising for efficient deep-UV optoelectronic devices. Published by AIP

   and thermal power generation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Utilizing the full solar spectrum is desirable to enhance the conversion
   efficiency of a solar power generator. In practice, this can be achieved
   through spectral splitting between multiple converters in parallel.
   However, it is unclear which wavelength bands should be directed to each
   converter in order to maximize the efficiency. We developed a model of
   an ideal hybrid solar converter which utilizes both a single-junction
   photovoltaic cell and a thermal engine. We determined the limiting
   efficiencies of this hybrid strategy and the corresponding optimum
   spectral bandwidth directed to the photovoltaic cell. This optimum width
   is inversely proportional to the thermal engine efficiency and scales
   with the bandgap of the photovoltaic cell. This bandwidth was also
   obtained analytically through an entropy minimization scheme and matches
   well with our model. We show that the maximum efficiency of the system
   occurs when it minimizes the spectral entropy generation. This concept
   can be extended to capture generalized non-idealities to increase the
   usefulness of this technique for a range of full solar spectrum
   utilization technologies. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{An exothermic neutron capture reaction can be used to uniquely identify
   neutrons in particle detectors. With the use of a capture-gated
   coincidence technique, the sequence of scatter events that lead to
   neutron thermalization prior to the neutron capture can also be used to
   measure neutron energy. We report on the measurement of thermalization
   light yield via a time-of-flight technique in a polyvinyl toluene-based
   scintillator EJ-290 within a heterogeneous composite detector that also
   includes Li-6-doped glass scintillator. The thermalization light output
   exhibits a strong correlation with neutron energy because of the
   preference for near-complete energy deposition prior to the
   Li-6(n,t)He-4 neutron capture reaction. The nonproportionality of the
   light yield from nuclear recoils contributes to the observed broadening
   of the distribution of thermalization light output. The nonproportional
   dependence of the scintillation light output in the EJ-290 scintillator
   as a function of proton recoil energy has been characterized in the
   range of 0.3-14.1 MeV via the Birks parametrization through a
   combination of time-of-flight measurement and previously conducted
   measurements with monoenergetic neutron sources.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{The phonovoltaic cell harvests optical phonons like a photovoltaic
   harvests photons, that is, a nonequilibrium (hot) population of optical
   phonons (at temperature T-p,T-O) more energetic than the band gap
   produces electron-hole pairs in a p-n junction, which separates these
   pairs to produce power. A phonovoltaic material requires an optical
   phonon mode more energetic than its band gap and much more energetic
   than the thermal energy (E-p,E-O > Delta E-e,E-g >> k(B)T), which
   relaxes by generating electrons and power (at rate (gamma) over
   dot(e-p)) rather than acoustic phonons and heat (at rate (gamma) over
   dot(p-p)). Graphene (h-C) is the most promising material candidate: when
   its band gap is tuned to its optical phonon energy without greatly
   reducing the electron-phonon (e-p) coupling, it reaches a substantial
   figure of merit {[}Z(pV) = Delta E-e,E-g(gamma) over
   dot(e-p)/E-p,E-O((gamma) over dot(e-p) + (gamma) over dot(p-p))
   approximate to 0.8]. A simple tight-binding (TB) model presented here
   predicts that lifting the sublattice symmetry of graphene in order to
   open a band gap proscribes the e-p interaction at the band edge, such
   that (gamma) over dot(e-p) -> 0 as Delta E-e,E-g -> E-p,E-O. However, ab
   initio (DFT-LDA) simulations of layered h-C/BN and substitutional h-C:
   BN show that the e-p coupling remains substantial in these asymmetric
   crystals. Indeed, h-C: BN achieves a high figure of merit (Z(pV)
   approximate to 0.6). At 300 K and for a Carnot limit of 0.5 (T-p,T-O =
   600 K), a h-C: BN phonovoltaic can reach an efficiency of eta(pV)
   approximate to 0.2, double the thermoelectric efficiency (ZT approximate
   to 1) under similar conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing demand for miniature autonomous sensors requires low cost

   We report on the deposition of GaAs nanowires on polycrystalline

   devices on dissimilar materials. Undoped, Si-doped, and Be-doped
   nanowires were grown at T-s = 400 degrees C on oxide (indium tin oxide)
   and metallic (platinum and titanium) films. Be-doping is shown to
   significantly reduce the nanowire diameter and improve the nanowire
   aspect ratio to 50:1. Photoluminescence measurements of Be-doped
   nanowires are 1-2 orders of magnitude stronger than undoped and Si-doped
   nanowires and have a thermal activation energy of 14 meV, which is
   comparable to nanowires grown on crystalline substrates. Electrical
   measurements confirm that the metal-semiconductor junction is Ohmic.

   mode numbers can be matched to a desired resonance frequency through

   and then used to determine the motional resistance for each mode. The
   resulting equation provides the basis for comparing performance between
   modes using motional resistance and quality factor. As a demonstration
   of the approach, a quality factor model that has been previously
   validated experimentally is introduced. Numerical results for silicon

   motional resistance and higher quality factor when the resonators under

Abstract = {{The role of ZnS shell on the photo-physical properties within CuInS2/ZnS
   quantum dots (QDs) is carefully studied in optoelectronic devices.
   Linearly increasing voltage technique has been employed to investigate
   the charge carrier dynamics of both CuInS2 and CuInS2/ZnS QDs films.
   This study shows that charge carriers follow a similar behavior of
   monomolecular recombination in this film, with their charge transfer
   rate correlates to the increase of applied voltage. It turns out that
   the ZnS shell could affect the carrier diffusion process through
   depressing the trapping states and would build up a potential barrier.}},

Abstract = {{Multiplex immunoassays are rapidly increasing in popularity due to the
   offered advantages of increased throughput and decreased sample volume
   requirements. However, a major weakness inherent to multiplex enzyme
   linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) is generation of false signals
   through reagent-driven cross-talk. Typically, multiplex platforms
   necessitate bath application of antibody cocktails, increasing
   probability of nonspecific antibody binding, especially when
   multiplexing large numbers of analytes. Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS)
   exploiting the phase separating polymers poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) and
   dextran (DEX) have been used to compartmentalize antibodies and prevent
   cross-talk in multliplex, plate-based ELISA. However, the resulting
   protocol is tedious and lengthy, and requires too many user steps to be
   practical for widespread use. Here, we report an improved,
   user-friendly, cross-talk-free multiplex ELISA method in which
   dehydrated arrays of colocalized capture and detection antibodies in DEX
   are prepared on multiwell plates. Addition of a PEG-based sample buffer
   rehydrates antibody/DEX droplets for analysis. In this report, we
   demonstrate rehydrated ATPS components for multiplex ELISA retain the
   ability to compartmentalize antibodies and prevent cross-talk, while
   analytes in sample buffer partition into rehydrated DEX droplets for
   analysis. Utility of this method was demonstrated through successful
   quantitative analysis of five inflammatory cytokines in
   lipopolysaccharide-stimulated ThP-1 cell culture supernatant.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the environmental impacts associated with hydraulic fracturing
   of unconventional gas wells are tied to the large volumes of water that
   such operations require. Efforts to develop nonaqueous alternatives have
   focused on carbon dioxide as a tunable working fluid even though the
   full environmental and production impacts of a switch away from water
   have yet to be quantified. Here we report on a life cycle analysis of
   using either water or CO2 for gas production in the Marcellus shale. The
   results show that CO2-based fluids, as currently conceived, could reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions by 400\% (with sequestration credit) and water
   consumption by 80\% when compared to conventional water-based fluids.
   These benefits are offset by a 44\% increase in net energy use when
   compared to slickwater fracturing as well as logistical barriers
   resulting from the need to move and store large volumes of CO2. Scenario
   analyses explore the outlook for CO2, which under best-case conditions
   could eventually reduce life cycle energy, water, and greenhouse gas
   (GHG) burdens associated with fracturing. To achieve these benefits, it
   will be necessary to reduce CO2 sourcing and transport burdens and to
   realize opportunities for improved energy recovery, averted water
   quality impacts, and carbon storage.}},

Abstract = {{Algae-derived biocrude oil is a possible renewable energy alternative to
   fossil fuel based crude oil. Outdoor cultivation in raceway ponds is
   estimated to provide a better return on energy invested than closed
   photobioreactor systems. However, in these open systems, algal crops are
   subjected to environmental variation in temperature and irradiance, as
   well as biotic invasions which can cause costly crop instabilities. In
   this paper, we used an experimental approach to investigate the ability
   of species richness to maximize and stabilize biocrude production in the
   face of weekly temperature fluctuations between 17 and 27 degrees C,
   relative to a constant-temperature control. We hypothesized that species
   richness would lead to higher mean biocrude production and greater
   stability of biocrude production over time in the variable temperature
   environment. Counter to our hypothesis, species richness tended to cause
   a decline in mean biocrude production, regardless of environmental
   temperature variation. However, biodiversity did have stabilizing
   effects on biocrude production over time in the variable temperature
   environment and not in the constant temperature environment. Altogether,
   our results suggest that when the most productive and stable monoculture
   is unknown, inoculating raceway ponds with a diverse mixture of algae
   will tend to ensure stable harvests over time.}},

Title = {{Chemically induced oxidative stress affects ASH neuronal function and
   behavior in C-elegans}},
Journal = {{Scientific Reports}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Oxidative stress (OS) impact on a single neuron's function in vivo
   remains obscure. Using C. elegans as a model organism, we report the
   effect of paraquat (PQ)-induced OS on wild type worms on the function of
   the ASH polymodal neuron. By calcium (Ca2+) imaging, we quantified ASH
   activation upon stimulus delivery. PQ-treated worms displayed higher
   maximum depolarization (peak of the Ca2+ transients) compared to
   untreated animals. PQ had a similar effect on the ASH neuron response
   time (rising slope of the Ca2+ transients), except in very young worms.
   OS effect on ASH was partially abolished in vitamin C-treated worms. We
   performed octanol and osmotic avoidance tests, to investigate the OS
   effect on ASH-dependent behaviors. PQ-treated worms have enhanced
   avoidance behavior compared to untreated ones, suggesting that elevated
   ASH Ca2+ transients result in enhanced ASH-mediated behavior. The above
   findings suggest a possible hormetic effect of PQ, as a factor inducing
   mild oxidative stress. We also quantified locomotion parameters
   (velocity, bending amplitude), which are not mediated by ASH activation.
   Bending amplitude did not differ significantly between treated and
   untreated worms; velocity in older adults decreased. The differential
   effect of OS on behavioral patterns may mirror a selective impact on the
   organism's neurons.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of flow topologies within the flames representing the
   corrugated flamelets, thin reaction zones, and broken reaction zone
   regimes of premixed turbulent combustion are investigated using direct
   numerical simulation data of statistically planar turbulent H-2-air

   diminishing influence of dilatation rate with increasing Karlovitz
   number has significant influences on the statistical behaviors of the
   first, second, and third invariants (i.e., P, Q, and R) of the velocity
   gradient tensor. These differences are reflected in the distributions of
   the flow topologies within the flames considered in this analysis. This
   has important consequences for those topologies that make dominant
   contributions to the scalar-turbulence interaction and vortex-stretching
   terms in the scalar dissipation rate and enstrophy transport equations,
   respectively. Detailed physical explanations are provided for the
   observed regime dependences of the flow topologies and their

   Using scanning electron microscopy-digital image correlation, full-field
   strain maps at the microscale were obtained during shape memory cycling.
   It was found that the strains induced by detwinning were quite
   heterogeneous at the microscale, and could display a large degree of
   similarity with thermo-mechanical cycling that tended to increase as
   cycling progressed. Residual strain concentrated at locations where
   strain accumulation from detwinning and plasticity were significant,
   indicating that martensitic detwinning and the associated plasticity
   that occurs with it is spatially correlated to the subsequent
   accumulation of residual strain at the microscale.}},

   pyrolysis of centimeter-scale pine wood particles at 520 degrees C The
   experiments were conducted in a vertical tube furnace and the yields and
   compositions of bio-oil were measured. We found that torrefaction at 225
   degrees C and 250 degrees C for 15, 25 and 35 min had little effect on
   the pyrolysis products. However, when wood was torrefied at 275 degrees
   C and 300 degrees C, significant char formation and transformation
   occurred. During the pyrolysis processes, lower weight loss rate and
   higher char fraction were observed for wood torrefied at 275 degrees C
   and 300 degrees C, but the center temperature profiles were not
   affected. Conversion time for pyrolysis was also not affected by the
   torrefaction conditions. Pyrolysis yields of liquid, gas and char were
   calculated and found to be affected by the torrefaction conditions.
   GC/MS analysis of bio-oil obtained from torrefied wood shows that the
   add content decreases with increasing torrefaction intensity, implying
   improvement of bio-oil quality. Further, phenol content increases and
   guaiacols content decreases with the increase of torrefaction intensity.
   On the other hand, no novel species were detected and the overall effect
   of torrefaction was less remarkable than anticipated for the
   temperatures tested. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Morphology-dependent load transfer governs the strength and failure

Abstract = {{The outstanding properties of individual carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have
   motivated interest in CNT fibers and yarns for composite materials,
   high-strength conductors and multifunctional textiles. However, despite
   advances in manufacturing, the strength of CNT yarns remains 10-100 fold
   less than individual CNTs. In light of the complex, multi-scale load
   transfer in CNT yarns, a hierarchical model taking into consideration
   the morphology-dependent mechanics is necessary to understand this
   limitation. We present a coupled analytical and finite element model of
   three-dimensional morphology and the full tensile behavior of CNT yarns.
   By incorporating load-induced changes in morphology, simulations of
   yarns in tension show different load paths such as fracture-type or
   stick-slip failure depending on the waviness and number density of CNTs.
   The strength of untwisted pristine CNT yarns is shown to be limited to <
   10\% of the intrinsic CNT strength, even at practical limits to CNT
   packing density and alignment. Load-induced changes in CNT morphology
   are verified by tensile testing of CNT yarns along with in-situ X-ray
   scattering. In addition, the nominal structure of the yarn is shown to
   strongly influence the improvement in strength achieved by densified
   and/or cross-linking, and a sublinear relationship between CNT contact
   enhancement and yarn strength is predicted. Thus, this work provides a
   means to investigate the complex load transfer mechanisms in CNT yarns
   and other assemblies, to further study their process-structure-property
   relationships, and to understand potential property limits. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a spatiotemporal decomposition for the detection of
   moving targets in multi-antenna synthetic aperture radar (SAR). As a
   high-resolution radar imaging modality, SAR detects and localizes
   nonmoving targets accurately, giving it an advantage over
   lower-resolution ground-moving target indication (GMTI) radars. Moving
   target detection is more challenging due to target smearing and masking
   by clutter. Space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is often used to
   remove the stationary clutter and enhance the moving targets. In this
   work, it is shown that the performance of STAP can be improved by
   modeling the clutter covariance as a space versus time Kronecker product
   with low-rank factors. Based on this model, a low-rank Kronecker product
   covariance estimation algorithm is proposed, and a novel separable
   clutter cancelation filter based on the Kronecker covariance estimate is
   introduced. The proposed method provides orders of magnitude reduction
   in the required number of training samples as well as improved
   robustness to corruption of the training data. Simulation results and
   experiments using the Gotcha SAR GMTI challenge dataset are presented
   that confirm the advantages of our approach relative to existing
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Barium titanate nanofibers were uniaxially aligned by electrospinning
   onto a rotating copper wire drum and alignment was maintained during
   calcination of the fibers. Two methods for maintaining alignment during

   method to remove the aligned fibers from the mandrel followed by
   calcination. The carbon tape removal method led to the formation of
   shorter aligned nanowires while the peeling off method resulted in
   longer nanofibers. Additionally, the effects of calcination temperature
   and time on crystal structure were also examined. The degree of
   tetragonality in the barium titanate nanofibers increased at higher
   calcination temperatures and times. Piezoelectricity was confirmed in
   the nanofibers calcined using piezoeresponse force microscopy, yielding
   a d(33) value of 15.5 pm/V. Using the methods presented here, large

Abstract = {{Solar energy is a fast growing energy source and has allowed the
   development of efficient, affordable, and easy-to-install photovoltaic
   systems over the years. Solar energy stakeholders are, however,
   concerned with sudden deterioration of photovoltaic systems'
   performance. Thus, effective change-point detection in solar panel
   performance analysis is essential for better harnessing solar energy and
   making photovoltaic systems more efficient. In particular, this study
   focuses on retrospectively identifying the time points of abrupt
   changes. Because the power generations from the solar panels are
   affected by a wide variety of factors, it is very difficult, if not
   impossible, to find a parametric model to detect abrupt changes in the
   power generation. We present a nonparametric detection method based on
   thresholded least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The
   proposed method has low computational complexity and is able to
   accurately detect performance changes while being robust against false
   detection under noisy signals. The performance of the proposed method in
   detection of abrupt changes is evaluated and compared with
   state-of-the-art methods through extensive simulations and a case study
   using data collected from four solar energy facilities. We demonstrate
   that the proposed method is superior to benchmark methods. The proposed
   method will help solar energy stakeholders in several aspects including
   operations planning, maintenance scheduling, warranty underwriting, and
   cost-benefit analysis. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to develop an automated model to extract temporal
   features from DCE-MRI in head-andneck (HN) cancers to localize
   significant tumor subvolumes having low blood volume (LBV) for
   predicting local and regional failure after chemoradiation therapy.
   Temporal features were extracted from time-intensity curves to build
   classification model for differentiating voxels with LBV from those with
   high BV. Support vector machine (SVM) classification was trained on the
   extracted features for voxel classification. Subvolumes with LBV were
   then assembled from the classified voxels with LBV. The model was
   trained and validated on independent datasets created from 456 873 DCE
   curves. The resultant subvolumes were compared to ones derived by a
   2-step method via pharmacokinetic modeling of blood volume, and
   evaluated for classification accuracy and volumetric similarity by DSC.
   The proposed model achieved an average voxel-level classification
   accuracy and DSC of 82\% and 0.72, respectively. Also, the model showed
   tolerance on different acquisition parameters of DCE-MRI. The model
   could be directly used for outcome prediction and therapy assessment in
   radiation therapy of HN cancers, or even supporting boost target
   definition in adaptive clinical trials with further validation. The
   model is fully automatable, extendable, and scalable to extract temporal
   features of DCE-MRI in other tumors.}},

Abstract = {{We study the Minimum Latency Submodular Cover (MLSC) problem, which
   consists of a metric (V, d) with source r is an element of V and m
   monotone submodular functions f(1), f(2), ... , f(m) : 2(V) -> {[} 0,
   1]. The goal is to find a path originating at r that minimizes the total
   ``cover time{''} of all functions. This generalizes well-studied
   problems, such as Submodular Ranking {[} Azar and Gamzu 2011] and the
   Group Steiner Tree {[} Garg et al. 2000]. We give a polynomial time
   O(log 1/epsilon . log(2+delta) vertical bar V vertical
   bar)-approximation algorithm for MLSC, where epsilon > 0 is the smallest
   non-zero marginal increase of any \{f(i)\}(i=1)(m) and delta > 0 is any
   constant. We also consider the Latency Covering Steiner Tree (LCST)
   problem, which is the special case of MLSC where the f(i)s are
   multi-coverage functions. This is a common generalization of the Latency
   Group Steiner Tree {[}Gupta et al. 2010; Chakrabarty and Swamy 2011] and
   Generalized Min-sum Set Cover {[} Azar et al. 2009; Bansal et al. 2010]
   problems. We obtain an O(log(2) vertical bar V vertical
   bar)-approximation algorithm for LCST. Finally, we study a natural
   stochastic extension of the Submodular Ranking problem and obtain an
   adaptive algorithm with an O(log 1/epsilon)-approximation ratio, which
   is best possible. This result also generalizes some previously studied
   stochastic optimization problems, such as Stochastic Set Cover
   {[}Goemans and Vondrak 2006] and Shared Filter Evaluation {[}Munagala et
   al. 2007; Liu et al. 2008].}},

   designed to achieve a functional performance with gradually variable
   properties in one or more directions. The effects of different metal
   alloys, composite fibers, and different aspect ratios and angular
   velocities on the free vibration analysis of FML beams are studied. The
   effects of different angular velocities and different aspect ratios of
   rotating and non-rotating hybrid composite beams are also investigated.
   Finally, the effects of different angular velocities and different

Abstract = {{The magnetospheric cusp is a funnel-shaped region where shocked solar
   wind plasma is able to enter the high-latitude magnetosphere via the
   process of magnetic reconnection. The plasma observations include
   various cusp signatures such as ion energy dispersions and diamagnetic
   effects. We present an overview analysis of cusp plasma observations at
   the Saturnian magnetosphere from the Cassini spacecraft era. A
   comparison of the observations is made as well as classification into
   groups due to varying characteristics. The locations of the reconnection
   site are calculated and shown to vary along the subsolar magnetopause.
   We show the first in situ evidence for lobe reconnection that occurred
   at nearly the same time as dayside reconnection for one of the cusp
   crossings. Evidence for ``bursty{''} and more ``continuous{''}
   reconnection signatures is observed at different cusp events. The events
   are compared to solar wind propagation models, and it is shown that
   magnetic reconnection and plasma injection into the cusp can occur for a
   variety of upstream conditions. These are important results because they
   show that Saturn's magnetospheric interaction with the solar wind and
   the resulting cusp signatures are dynamic and that plasma injection in
   the cusp occurs due to a variety of solar wind conditions. Furthermore,
   reconnection can proceed at a variety of locations along the
   magnetopause.}},

Abstract = {{Dubins planners provide minimum-length planar paths between waypoints
   for turning constrained vehicles. For a no-thrust or glider aircraft,
   Dubins paths have been extrapolated to three dimensions by augmenting
   the planar path with a constant flight-path angle in each path segment.
   Best-glide flight maximizes the horizontal distance traveled per unit
   altitude loss, but steeper flight-path angles result in a maximum
   heading change per unit altitude loss. This paper investigates
   combinations of bank and flight-path angles yielding maximum ranges for
   gliding Dubins trajectories. Starting from the extrema flight-path
   angles usually applied in the literature, it is shown that the maximum
   range along each flight radial from an initial point (that is, the
   footprint) is obtained at a maximum glidepath angle for a given turn
   radius. This result is applied in a novel three-dimensional
   maximum-range Dubins path. Threedimensional Dubins examples with
   different heading constraints are presented. The impact of constraining
   solutions to a single pair of turning bank and flight-path angles is
   analyzed.}},

Title = {{Life Cycle Assessment of Offshore Wind Farm Siting Effects of Locational
   Factors, Lake Depth, and Distance from Shore}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{According to previous studies, the life cycle energy intensity of an
   offshore wind farm (OWF) varies between 0.03 and 0.13 megawatt-hours
   (MWh) of primary energy for each MWh of electricity generated. The
   variation in these life cycle energy intensity studies, after
   normalizing for capacity factor and life span, is significantly affected
   by OWF location because of geographical properties, namely, wind speed
   and water depth. To improve OWF siting, this study investigates how an
   OWF's distance from shore and geographical location impacts its
   environmental benefit. A process-based life cycle assessment is
   conducted to compare 20 OWF siting scenarios in Michigan's Great Lakes
   for their cumulative fossil energy demand, global warming potential, and
   acidification potential. Each scenario (four lake locations at five
   offshore distances) has unique foundation, transmission, installation,
   and operational requirements based on site characteristics. The results
   demonstrate that the cumulative environmental burden from an OWF is most
   significantly affected by (1) water depth, (2) distance from shore, and
   (3) distance to power grid, in descending order of importance, if all
   other site-relevant variables are held constant. The results also show
   that when OWFs are sited further offshore, the benefit of increased wind
   energy generation does not necessarily outweigh the increase in negative
   environmental impacts. This suggests that siting OWF nearer to shore may
   result in a better life cycle environmental performance. Finally, we
   demonstrate how much an OWF's environmental burdens can be reduced if
   the OWF system is either recycled, transported a shorter distance, or
   manufactured in a region with a high degree of renewable energy on the
   grid.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fully synthesizable low power interconnect bus for

   minimizes the required chip real estate with low input/output pad count

   drain-based solution, the bus can be fully synthesizable. Low power is
   achieved by obviating a need for local oscillators in member nodes.
   Also, aggressive power gating allows low-power standby mode with only 53
   gates powered on. An integrated wakeup scheme is compatible with a power
   management unit that has nW standby mode. A 3-module system including
   the bus is fabricated in a 180 nm process. The entire system consumes 8
   nW in standby mode, and the bus achieves 17.5 pJ/bit/chip.}},

Title = {{Scenario Discovery with Multiple Criteria: An Evaluation of the Robust

Abstract = {{There is increasing concern over deep uncertainty in the risk analysis
   field as probabilistic models of uncertainty cannot always be
   confidently determined or agreed upon for many of our most pressing
   contemporary risk challenges. This is particularly true in the climate
   change adaptation field, and has prompted the development of a number of
   frameworks aiming to characterize system vulnerabilities and identify
   robust alternatives. One such methodology is robust decision making
   (RDM), which uses simulation models to assess how strategies perform
   over many plausible conditions and then identifies and characterizes
   those where the strategy fails in a process termed scenario discovery.
   While many of the problems to which RDM has been applied are
   characterized by multiple objectives, research to date has provided
   little insight into how treatment of multiple criteria impacts the
   failure scenarios identified. In this research, we compare different
   methods for incorporating multiple objectives into the scenario
   discovery process to evaluate how they impact the resulting failure
   scenarios. We use the Lake Tana basin in Ethiopia as a case study, where
   climatic and environmental uncertainties could impact multiple planned
   water infrastructure projects, and find that failure scenarios may vary
   depending on the method used to aggregate multiple criteria. Common
   methods used to convert multiple attributes into a single utility score
   can obscure connections between failure scenarios and system
   performance, limiting the information provided to support decision
   making. Applying scenario discovery over each performance metric
   separately provides more nuanced information regarding the relative
   sensitivity of the objectives to different uncertain parameters, leading
   to clearer insights on measures that could be taken to improve system
   robustness and areas where additional research might prove useful.}},

Abstract = {{The detection efficiency of electrostatic collection radon monitors is
   influenced by the humidity of the air in the collection cell. This is
   due to the recombination of positively charged Po-218 with OH- ions,
   whose concentration depends on humidity. A novel design of an
   electrostatic collection cell, in which the air pressure in the cell is
   less than the atmospheric pressure, is proposed to eliminate the impact
   of humidity. As a result of the lower air pressure, the drift velocity
   of the positively charged Po-218 in the electric field increases, so the
   collection time decreases. A model predicting the collection efficiency
   of positively charged Po-218 in this kind of electrostatic collection
   cell is presented. Based on the model, if the air pressure in the cell
   is sufficiently low, the collection efficiency will be approximately a
   constant and the dependency of the collection efficiency of the
   positively charged Po-218 upon the water vapor concentration can be
   ignored. This approach can be applied to develop a new radon monitor.}},

Title = {{Support vector machine classification of arterial volume-weighted
   arterial spin tagging images}},
Journal = {{Brain and Behavior}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: In recent years,machine-learning techniques have gained
   growing popularity in medical image analysis. Temporal brain-state
   classification is one of the major applications of machine-learning
   techniques in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain data.
   This article explores the use of support vector machine (SVM)
   classification technique with motor-visual activation paradigm to
   perform brain-state classification into activation and rest with an
   emphasis on different acquisition techniques.
   Methods: Images were acquired using a recently developed variant of
   traditional pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling technique called
   arterial volume-weighted arterial spin tagging (AVAST). The
   classification scheme is also performed on images acquired using blood
   oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) and traditional perfusion-weighted
   arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques for comparison.
   Results: The AVAST technique outperforms traditional pseudocontinuous
   ASL, achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of BOLD
   contrast images.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that AVAST has superior
   signal-to-noise ratio and improved temporal resolution as compared with
   traditional perfusion-weighted ASL and reduced sensitivity to scanner
   drift as compared with BOLD. Owing to these characteristics, AVAST lends
   itself as an ideal choice for dynamic fMRI and real-time neurofeedback
   experiments with sustained activation periods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents innovative back-channel wireless communication
   techniques for ultra-low power (ULP) devices. The concept of embedded
   back-channel communication is proposed to enable a variety of new
   applications by inter-connecting heterogeneous ULP devices through
   existing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based WiFi
   (IEEE 802.11a/g/n/ac) networks. The proposed back-channel communication
   allows ULP devices to decode messages embedded in WiFi OFDM packets even
   if these ULP devices are incapable of demodulating OFDM. The proposed
   back-channel signaling has unique properties that are easily detectable
   by non-WiFi ULP receivers consuming sub-mW of active power. The proposed
   scheme eliminates the need for specialized transmitter hardware or
   dedicated channel resources for embedded back-channel signal
   transmission. Instead, carefully sequenced data bit streams will
   generate back-channel messages from already-deployed WiFi infrastructure
   without any hardware modification. This paper demonstrates that WiFi
   OFDM back-channel communication is feasible in various modulation
   formats, such as pulse position modulation, pulse phase shift keying, or
   frequency shift keying. Systematic algorithms are unveiled to create
   back-channel messages in various modulation formats from a WiFi standard
   compliant datapath. Comprehensive bit error rate performance analysis of
   various WiFi back-channel communication schemes is derived and validated
   in realistic multi-path frequency selective fading channels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an energy-autonomous wireless communication system
   for ultra-small Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. In the proposed
   system, all necessary components, including the battery,
   energy-harvesting solar cells, and the RF antenna, are fully integrated
   within a millimeter-scale form factor. Designing an energy-optimized
   wireless communication system for such a miniaturized platform is
   challenging because of unique system constraints imposed by the
   ultra-small system dimension. The proposed system targets orders of
   magnitude improvement in wireless communication energy efficiency
   through a comprehensive system-level analysis that jointly optimizes
   various system parameters, such as node dimension, modulation scheme,
   synchronization protocol, RF/analog/digital circuit specifications,
   carrier frequency, and a miniaturized 3-D antenna. We propose a new
   protocol and modulation schemes that are specifically designed for
   energy-scarce ultrasmall IoT nodes. These new schemes exploit abundant
   signal processing resources on gateway devices to simplify design for
   energy-scarce ultra-small sensor nodes. The proposed dynamic link
   adaptation guarantees that the ultra-small IoT node always operates in
   the most energy efficient mode for a given operating scenario. The
   outcome is a truly energy-optimized wireless communication system to
   enable various classes of new applications, such as implanted smart-dust

Abstract = {{An object-based evaluation method using a pattern recognition algorithm
   (i.e., classification trees) is applied to the simulated orographic
   precipitation for idealized experimental setups using the National
   Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model (CAM)
   with the finite volume (FV) and the Eulerian spectral transform
   dynamical cores with varying resolutions. Daily simulations were
   analyzed and three different types of precipitation features were
   identified by the classification tree algorithm. The statistical
   characteristics of these features (i.e., maximum value, mean value, and
   variance) were calculated to quantify the difference between the
   dynamical cores and changing resolutions. Even with the simple and
   smooth topography in the idealized setups, complexity in the
   precipitation fields simulated by the models develops quickly. The
   classification tree algorithm using objective thresholding successfully
   detected different types of precipitation features even as the
   complexity of the precipitation field increased. The results show that
   the complexity and the bias introduced in small-scale phenomena due to
   the spectral transform method of CAM Eulerian spectral dynamical core is
   prominent, and is an important reason for its dissimilarity from the FV
   dynamical core. The resolvable scales, both in horizontal and vertical
   dimensions, have significant effect on the simulation of precipitation.
   The results of this study also suggest that an efficient and informative
   study about the biases produced by GCMs should involve daily (or even
   hourly) output (rather than monthly mean) analysis over local scales.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we review a series of studies that we initiated to
   examine mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in the
   hope that these injuries, and their sequelae, can be better prevented.
   First, using the earliest in vitro model of a simulated single-leg jump
   landing or pivot cut with realistic knee loading rates and trans-knee
   muscle forces, we identified the worst-case dynamic knee loading that
   causes the greatest peak ACL strain: Combined knee compression, flexion,
   and internal tibial rotation. We also identified morphologic factors
   that help explain individual susceptibility to ACL injury. Second, using
   the above knee loading, we introduced a possible paradigm shift in ACL
   research by demonstrating that the human ACL can fail by a sudden
   rupture in response to repeated sub-maximal knee loading. If that load
   is repeated often enough over a short time interval, the failure tended
   to occur proximally, as observed clinically. Third, we emphasize the
   value of a physical exam of the hip by demonstrating how limited
   internal axial rotation at the hip both increases the susceptibility to
   ACL injury in professional athletes, and also increases peak ACL strain
   during simulated pivot landings, thereby further increasing the risk of
   ACL fatigue failure. When training at-risk athletes, particularly
   females with their smaller ACL cross-sections, rationing the number and
   intensity of worst-case knee loading cycles, such that ligament
   degradation is within the ACL's ability to remodel, should decrease the
   risk for ACL rupture due to ligament fatigue failure.(c) 2016

Abstract = {{This work focuses on pollution control in the trans-boundary area of
   Taihu Basin. Considering the unique characteristics of the river network
   in the study area, a new methodology of pollution control is proposed
   aiming at improving the water quality in the trans-boundary area and
   reducing conflicts between up and downstream regions. Based on
   monitoring data and statistical analysis, important trans-boundary cross
   sections identified by the regional government were selected as
   important areas for consideration in developing management objectives;
   using a 1-D mathematicmodel and an effective weight evaluation model,
   the trans-boundary effective control scope (TECS) of the study area was
   identified as the scope for pollutant control; the acceptable pollution
   load was then estimated using an established model targeting
   bi-directional flow. The results suggest that the water environmental
   capacity for chemical oxygen demand (COD), in order to guarantee
   reaching the target water quality standard in the TECS, is 160,806
   t/year, and amounts to 16,098 t/year, 3493 t/year, and 39,768 t/year for
   ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus, respectively.
   Our study method and results have been incorporated into the local
   government management project, and have been proven to be useful in
   designing a pollution control strategy and management policy.}},

Title = {{Modified Nanoemulsions with Iron Oxide for Magnetic Resonance Imaging}},
Journal = {{NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A nanoemulsion (NE) is a surfactant-based, oil-in-water, nanoscale,
   high-energy emulsion with a mean droplet diameter of 400-600 nm. When
   mixed with antigen and applied nasally, a NE acts as a mucosal adjuvant
   and induces mucosal immune responses. One possible mechanism for the
   adjuvant effect of this material is that it augments antigen uptake and
   distribution to lymphoid tissues, where the immune response is
   generated. Biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticles have been used as a
   unique imaging approach to study the dynamics of cells or molecular
   migration. To study the uptake of NEs and track them in vivo, iron oxide
   nanoparticles were synthesized and dispersed in soybean oil to make iron
   oxide-modified NEs. Our results show that iron oxide nanoparticles can
   be stabilized in the oil phase of the nanoemulsion at a concentration of
   30 mu g/L and the iron oxide-modified NEs have a mean diameter of 521
   nm. In vitro experiments demonstrated that iron oxide-modified NEs can
   affect uptake by TC-1 cells (a murine epithelial cell line) and reduce
   the intensity of magnetic resonance (MR) images by shortening the T2
   time. Most importantly, in vivo studies demonstrated that iron
   oxide-modified NE could be detected in mouse nasal septum by both
   transmission electron microscopy and MR imaging. Altogether these
   experiments demonstrate that iron oxide-modified NE is a unique tool
   that can be used to study uptake and distribution of NEs after nasal
   application.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years, water ice and salts capable of melting this ice
   and producing liquid saline water (brine) have been detected on Mars.
   Moreover, indirect evidence for brine has been found in multiple areas
   of the planet. Here, we simulate full diurnal cycles of temperature and
   atmospheric water vapor content at the Phoenix landing site for the
   first time and show experimentally that, in spite of the low Mars-like
   chamber temperature, brine forms minutes after the ground temperature
   exceeds the eutectic temperature of salts in contact with water ice.
   Moreover, we show that the brine stays liquid for most of the diurnal
   cycle when enough water ice is available to compensate for evaporation.
   This is predicted to occur seasonally in areas of the polar region where
   the temperature exceeds the eutectic value and frost or snow is
   deposited on saline soils, or where water ice and salts coexist in the
   shallow subsurface. This is important because the existence of liquid
   water is a key requirement for habitability.}},

Title = {{POEM: Minimizing Energy Consumption for WiFi Tethering Service}},
Journal = {{IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3785-3797}},

Abstract = {{Despite the rapidly increasing number of public WiFi hotspots, their
   coverage is still limited to indoor and office/business environments.
   WiFi tethering is thus a useful and economic means of providing
   on-the-go mobile users' Internet connection. One of the main problems of
   WiFi tethering is the excessive power consumption of mobile access
   points (APs), or tethered smartphones. Since the power-saving mechanism,
   defined and deployed in the IEEE 802.11 standard, is intended for
   clients only, the WiFi interface of a mobile AP never enters the sleep
   mode. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective system, called
   power-efficient mobile (POEM), which reduces energy consumption of a
   mobile AP by allowing its WiFi interface to sleep even during data
   transfer. The POEM exploits the inherent bandwidth asymmetry between the
   WiFi and the WWAN interfaces of a mobile AP by buffering the data
   packets received via the WWAN interface at the mobile AP, thereby
   allowing the WiFi interface to enter the sleep mode. Compared with the
   other power-saving solutions for WiFi tethering, the POEM is able to
   handle various types of applications, such as video steaming and file
   download, designed to support legacy clients (i.e., clients without
   POEM), and is also efficient in reducing the clients' energy
   consumption. We have implemented and conducted an extensive evaluation
   of the POEM's effectiveness in an android/linux-based test bed. Our
   experimental results show that the POEM can allow the WiFi interface of
   a mobile AP to sleep for up to 90\% of the total transfer time without
   significantly affecting system throughput or end-to-end delay.}},

Abstract = {{In Compton imaging, iterative methods provide good performance but are
   usually computationally intensive. Thus, direct inverse algorithms such
   as filtered back-projection (FBP) are preferable when computation time
   is limited. The conventional FBP method assumes that the point spread
   function of a back-projection image is isotropic and invariant to
   incident direction, as required by frequency spectrum analysis. However,
   most of the time this assumption is not true because the detector
   geometry is rarely uniform. Therefore the conventional FBP reconstructed
   image is biased. To solve the geometry non-uniformity problem, this
   paper proposes an unbiased FBP algorithm that groups Compton events
   having the same Compton rings using a system matrix decomposition
   strategy. The proposed method produces more isotropic resolution, and
   preserves the capability to use frequency spectrum analysis. The
   algorithm has been applied to data from a 3D position-sensitive detector
   array with 4 crystals and a digital readout system. The resulting images
   had more isotropic resolution than standard FBP.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the effects of urban aerosols on a mesoscale
   convective system (MCS) in the central Great Plains with the Weather
   Research and Forecasting Model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem). Urban
   emissions from Kansas City, Missouri, were scaled by factors of 0.5,
   1.0, and 2.0 to investigate the impact of urban aerosol load on MCS
   propagation and strength. The first half of the storm development is
   characterized by a stationary front to the north of Kansas City (phase
   I; 1800 UTC 26 May-0600 UTC 27 May), which develops into a squall line
   south of the urban area (phase II; 0600-1800 UTC 27 May). During phase
   I, doubling urban emissions shifts the precipitation accumulation, with
   enhancement downwind of the storm propagation and suppression upwind.
   During phase II, a squall line develops in the baseline and doubled
   emissions scenarios but not when emissions are halved. These changes in
   MCS propagation and strength are a function of cold pool strength, which
   is determined by microphysical processes and directly influenced by
   aerosol load. Overall, changes in urban emissions drive changes in cloud
   microphysics, which trigger large-scale changes in storm morphology and
   precipitation patterns. These results show that urban emissions can play
   an important role in mesoscale weather systems.}},

Title = {{Effects of the precursor electron bunch on quasi-phase matched direct
   laser acceleration}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Direct laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons can be achieved by
   utilizing the axial field of a well-guided, radially polarized laser
   pulse in a density-modulated plasma waveguide. When a laser pulse of a
   few terawatt (TW) peak power is applied, however, the laser
   ponderomotive force perturbs plasma electrons to concentrate in the
   center, such that the generated electrostatic fields can significantly
   defocus the externally injected electron witness bunch and considerably
   deteriorate the acceleration efficiency. To improve the performance of
   DLA, a leading electron bunch, which acts as a precursor, can be
   introduced in DLA to effectively confine the witness bunch.
   Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations have been conducted to
   demonstrate that the transverse properties of the witness bunch can be
   significantly improved when a precursor bunch is used. Selected bunch
   transverse sizes, bunch charges, and axial separation from the witness
   bunch have been assigned to the precursor in a series of DLA
   simulations. Since a favorable ion-focusing force is provided by the
   precursor, the transverse properties of witness bunch can be maintained
   when a relatively high-power (similar to 2 TW) laser pulse is used in
   DLA, and an improved overall acceleration efficiency can be achieved.

Abstract = {{The effective scaling of positron-electron pair production by direct,

   found to be consistent with the Bethe-Heitler mechanism, where the
   number of positrons emitted into a 1 steradian cone angle from the
   target rear was found to be proportional to Z(2). The unexpectedly low

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Discrete helical modes have been experimentally observed from implosion
   to explosion in cylindrical, axially magnetized ultrathin foils (B-z =
   0.2 - 2.0 T) using visible self-emission and laser shadowgraphy. The
   striation angle of the helices, phi, was found to increase during the
   implosion and decrease during the explosion, despite the large azimuthal
   magnetic field (>40 T). These helical striations are interpreted as
   discrete, non-axisymmetric eigenmodes that persist from implosion to
   explosion, obeying the simple relation phi = m/kR, where m, k, and R are
   the azimuthal mode number, axial wavenumber, and radius, respectively.
   Experimentally, we found that (a) there is only one, or at the most two,
   dominant unstable eigenmode, (b) there does not appear to be a sharp
   threshold on the axial magnetic field for the emergence of the
   non-axisymmetric helical modes, and (c) higher axial magnetic fields
   yield higher azimuthal modes. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of carbon nanotube (CNT) networks and analogous materials
   comprising filamentary nanostructures are governed by the intrinsic
   filament properties and their hierarchical organization and
   interconnection. As a result, direct knowledge of the collective
   dynamics of CNT synthesis and self-organization is essential to
   engineering improved CNT materials for applications such as membranes
   and thermal interfaces. Here, we use real-time environmental
   transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) to observe nucleation and
   self-organization of CNTs into vertically aligned forests. Upon
   introduction of the carbon source, we observe a large scatter in the
   onset of nucleation of individual CNTs and the ensuing growth rates.
   Experiments performed at different temperatures and catalyst particle
   densities show the critical role of CNT density on the dynamics of
   self-organization; low-density CNT nucleation results in the CNTs
   becoming pinned to the substrate and forming random networks, whereas
   higher density CNT nucleation results in self-organization of the CNTs
   into bundles that are oriented perpendicular to the substrate. We also
   find that mechanical coupling between growing CNTs alters their growth
   trajectory and shape, causing significant deformations, buckling, and
   defects in the CNT walls. Therefore, it appears that CNT CNT coupling
   not only is critical for self-organization but also directly influences
   CNT quality and likely the resulting properties of the forest. Our
   findings show that control of the time-distributed kinetics of CNT
   nucleation and bundle formation are critical to manufacturing
   well-organized CNT assemblies and that E-TEM can be a powerful tool to
   investigate the mesoscale dynamics of CNT networks.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{125}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Teeth are key to understanding the feeding ecology of both extant and
   extinct vertebrates. Recent studies have highlighted the previously
   unrecognized complexity of dinosaur dentitions and how specific tooth
   tissues and tooth shapes differ between taxa with different diets.
   However, it is unknown how the ultrastructure of these tooth tissues
   contributes to the differences in feeding style between taxa. In this
   study, we use third harmonic generation microscopy and scanning electron
   microscopy to examine the ultrastructure of the dentine in herbivorous
   and carnivorous dinosaurs to understand how the structure of this tissue
   contributes to the overall utility of the tooth. Morphometric analyses
   of dentinal tubule diameter, density and branching rates reveal a strong
   signal for dietary preferences, with herbivorous saurischian and
   ornithischian dinosaurs consistently having higher dentinal tubule
   density than their carnivorous relatives. We hypothesize that this
   relates to the hardness of the dentine, where herbivorous taxa have
   dentine that is more resistant to breakage and wear at the
   dentine-enamel junction than carnivorous taxa. This study advocates the
   detailed study of dentine and the use of advanced microscopy techniques
   to understand the evolution of dentition and feeding ecology in extinct
   vertebrates.}},

   processing of materials. It is remarkable that ultrafast lasers with 20
   to 600 femtosecond pulse duration can have such a dramatic impact on
   materials. As we learn more about the fundamental mechanisms that drive
   the ultrafast laser-material response, even more applications are

Abstract = {{Topology optimization is traditionally framed in a static and
   deterministic setting notwithstanding the uncertain dynamic nature of
   many problems. This paper presents a new data-driven simulation-based
   framework for the effective topology optimization of uncertain and
   dynamic wind-excited tall buildings. The performance of the system is
   described through probabilistic performance integrals that encapsulate
   state-of-the-art performance-based design driven by climatological,
   aerodynamic and fragility data sets for describing the site-specific
   hazard, aerodynamic response and damage susceptibility of the system. To
   solve the resulting probabilistic topology optimization problem, a
   sequential optimization strategy is developed that is based on solving a
   series of high quality approximate sub-problems. A suite of case studies
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) has been widely used to
   design engineering products with minimum cost function while meeting
   reliability constraints. Although uncertainties, such as aleatory
   uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty, have been well considered in
   RBDO, they are mainly considered for model input parameters. Model
   uncertainty, i.e., the uncertainty of model bias indicating the inherent
   model inadequacy for representing the real physical system, is typically
   overlooked in RBDO. This paper addresses model uncertainty approximation
   in a product design space and further integrates the model uncertainty
   into RBDO. In particular, a copula-based bias modeling approach is
   proposed and results are demonstrated by two vehicle design problems.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing by layerwise photopolymerization, commonly called
   stereolithography (SLA), is attractive due to its high resolution and
   diversity of materials chemistry. However, traditional SLA methods are
   restricted to planar substrates and planar layers that are perpendicular
   to a single-axis build direction. Here, we present a robotic system that
   is capable of maskless layerwise photopolymerization on curved surfaces,
   enabling production of large-area conformal patterns and the
   construction of conformal freeform objects. The system comprises an
   industrial six-axis robot and a custom-built maskless projector end
   effector. Use of the system involves creating a mesh representation of
   the freeform substrate, generation of a triangulated toolpath with
   curved layers that represents the target object to be printed, precision
   mounting of the substrate in the robot workspace, and robotic
   photopatterning of the target object by coordinated motion of the robot
   and substrate. We demonstrate printing of conformal photopatterns on
   spheres of various sizes, and construction of miniature
   three-dimensional objects on spheres without requiring support features.
   Improvement of the motion accuracy and development of freeform toolpaths
   would enable construction of polymer objects that surpass the size and
   support structure constraints imparted by traditional SLA systems.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{CONSPECTUS: Catalyst-transfer polycondensation (CTP) has emerged as a
   useful living, chain-growth polymerization method for synthesizing
   conjugated (hetero)arene-based polymers with targetable molecular
   weights, narrow dispersities, and controllable copolymer sequences all
   properties that significantly influence their performance in devices.
   Over the past decade, several phosphine- and carbene-ligated Ni- and
   Pd-based precatalysts have been shown to be effective in CTP. One
   current limitation is that these traditional CTP catalysts lead to
   nonliving, non-chain-growth behavior when complex monomer scaffolds are
   utilized. Because these monomers are often found in the
   highest-performing materials, there is a significant need to identify
   alternative CTP catalysts. Recent mechanistic insight into CTP has laid
   the foundation for designing new catalysts to expand the CTP monomer
   scope. Building off this insight, we have designed and implemented model
   systems to identify effective catalysts by understanding their
   underlying mechanistic behaviors and systematically modifying catalyst
   structures to improve their chain-growth behavior. In this Account, we
   describe how each catalyst parameter the ancillary ligand(s), reactive
   ligand(s), and transition metal-influences CTP. As an example, ancillary
   ligands often dictate the turnover-limiting step of the catalytic cycle,
   and perhaps more importantly, they can be used to promote the formation
   of the key intermediate (a metal arene associative complex) and its
   subsequent reactivity. The fidelity of this intermediate is central to
   the mechanism for the living, chain-growth polymerization. Reactive
   ligands, on the other hand, can be used to improve catalyst solubility
   and accelerate initiation. Additional advantages of the reactive ligand
   include providing access points for postpolymerization modification and
   synthesizing polymers directly off surfaces. While the most frequently
   used CTP catalysts contain nickel, palladium-based catalysts exhibit a
   higher functional group tolerance and broader substrate scope (e.g.,
   monomers with boron, magnesium, tin, and gold transmetalating agents).
   Overall, we anticipate that applying the tools and lessons detailed in
   this Account to other monomers should facilitate a better
   ``matchmaking{''} process that will lead to new catalyst-transfer
   polycondensations.}},

Abstract = {{Polymerizing electron-deficient arenes in a controlled, chain-growth
   fashion remains a significant challenge despite a decade of research on
   catalyst-transfer polycondensation. The prevailing hypothesis is that
   the chain-growth mechanism stalls at a strongly associated metal-polymer
   a. complex, preventing catalyst turnover. To evaluate this hypothesis,
   we performed mechanistic studies using thiazole derivatives and
   identified approaches to improve their chain growth polymerization.
   These studies revealed a surprisingly high barrier for chain-walking
   toward the reactive C-X bond. In addition, a competitive pathway
   involving chain-transfer to monomer was identified. This pathway is
   facilitated by ancillary ligand dissociation and N-coordination to the
   incoming monomer. We found that this chain-transfer pathway can be
   attenuated by using a rigid ancillary ligand, leading to an improved
   polymerization. Combined, these studies provide mechanistic insight into
   the challenges associated with electron deficient monomers as well as
   ways to improve their living, chain-growth polymerization. Our
   mechanistic studies also revealed an unexpected radical anion-mediated
   oligomerization in the absence of catalyst, as well as a surprising
   oxidative addition into the thiazole C-S bond in a model system.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-chamber model for the combustion instabilities manifested in a
   gas turbine model combustor was developed. The proposed model was used
   to explain the dependencies of instability frequency on burner geometry
   and other flow parameters, some of which could not be reconciled with
   previous models. The new model was built upon the Helmholtz analysis of
   two connected resonators. The instability frequency as well as the
   complex pressure ratio between two chambers were predicted by solving
   ordinary differential equations. To assess the assumptions and
   predictions of the proposed model, the spectra and magnitude of the
   oscillations of pressure, heat release rate, and velocity were measured
   for four different operating conditions: rich (R1), lean (L1),
   stoichiometric (S1), and reduced flow rate (R2) with a kilohertz laser
   diagnostic system. These measurements reconfirmed that the instability
   is of Helmholtz type. A global equivalence ratio that is consistently
   greater than unity was identified to be an enabling factor for
   combustion instability. This is also in agreement with the predictions
   made by the proposed model. Furthermore, the model was shown to be able
   to predict the right trend of instability frequency when multiple
   parameters were changed. It is concluded that the current model is an
   improvement over previous models, because the acoustic coupling between
   different chambers of the burner was considered. (C) 2016 The Combustion

Abstract = {{Objective/Background: Several risk factors have been identified in type
   B aortic dissection (TBAD), namely tear size, location, patency and
   number, and false lumen (FL) location. However, the individual impact of
   each of these factors is poorly understood. The impact of these factors
   was investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
   Methods: Fourteen idealized models of chronic TBAD were created of
   different shapes (straight vs. curved vessels), different number of
   proximal and distal tears, tear size (4, 10, and 20 mm diameter) and
   shape (circular or elliptical), FL location (inner or outer arch),
   treated (stented), and untreated. All models had identical length,
   relative size of true lumen (TL) and FL, and inlet (flow) and outlet
   (pressure) boundary conditions. Using validated CFD tools, inlet mean
   pressure (MP), pulse pressure (PP), TL and FL pressures, velocities, and
   flows were computed for each model..
   Results: AD increased PP and MP relative to undissected aorta. Curvature
   did not change pressure and flow ratio between TL and FL. Inner
   curvature FL showed slightly larger pressures and tear velocities.
   Larger tears decreased hemodynamic differences between TL and FL. The
   combination of proximal and distal tear size determines the overall
   hemodynamics: larger proximal tears increased FL PP by up to 76\%.
   Conversely, larger distal tears decreased FL PP and MP. Large proximal
   and distal tears decreased tear velocity (by up to 65\%) and increased
   FL flow (up to 12 times). Proximal tear stenting resulted in a 54\%
   reduction of PP. Conversely, distal occlusion tear increased FL PP and
   MP by 144\% and 7\%, respectively.
   Conclusion: Unfavorable hemodynamic conditions such as larger FL
   pressure occur when distal tear is small or absent, proximal tears are
   large, and FL is at the inner curvature, in agreement with previous
   clinical studies. CFD analysis is a powerful tool to understand the
   interplay between anatomy and hemodynamics in TBAD. (C) 2016 European

Title = {{Effects of needle inner surface topography on friction and biopsy length}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{412-418}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The effects of inner surface topography on friction force and the
   coefficient of friction between an inner surface of needle and tissue
   phantom during needle insertion and on biopsy length are examined using
   polished, and unpolished needles. In this paper, the inner surfaces of
   the needles are altered by magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF), and the
   needle inner surfaces were smoothed from 0.43 to 0.02 mu m Sa (referred
   to as the smoothly polished needle) or 0.26 mu m Sa (referred to as the
   roughly polished needle). With polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a
   tissue-mimicking phantom material, the smoothly polished needle results
   in the smallest inner friction force (0.0024 N/mm), the smallest
   coefficient of friction (0.35), and the longest biopsy length (34.3 mm).
   The roughly polished needle produces the largest inner friction force
   (0.0041 N/mm), the largest coefficient of friction (0.56), and the
   shortest biopsy length (30.5 mm). Although the inner surface roughness
   of the roughly polished needle is lower than that of the unpolished
   needle, the inner friction force and coefficient of friction are larger
   than those of the unpolished needle. This may be caused by the ridges
   and grooves in the circumferential direction of the roughly polished
   needle made with MAF. Based on the surface topography data, the ratchet
   mechanism is utilized to calculate the coefficient of friction. The
   results suggest a higher coefficient of friction in the roughly polished
   needle. The biopsy tests also show the shortest biopsy sample is
   extracted using the roughly polished needles, which exhibit the greatest
   inner friction force.}},

Abstract = {{Coke quality has a critical role in the steelmaking industry. The aim of
   this study is to examine the complex relationships between various
   conventional coal analyses using coke making index ``free swelling index
   (FSI){''}. Random forest (RF) associated with variable importance
   measurements (VIMs), which is a new powerful statistical data mining
   approach, is utilized in this study to analyze a high-dimensional
   database (3961 samples) to rank variables, and to develop an accurate
   FSI predictive model based on the most important variables. VIMs was
   performed on various types of analyses which indicated that volatile
   matter, carbon, moisture (coal rank parameters) and organic sulfur are
   the most effective coal properties for the prediction of FSI. These
   variables have been used as an input set of RF model for the FSI
   modeling and prediction. Results of FSI model indicated that RF can
   provide a satisfactory prediction of FSI with the correlation of
   determination R-2 = 0.96 and mean square error of 0.16 from laboratory
   FSIs (which is smaller than the interval unit of FSI; 0.5). Based on
   this result, RF can be used to rank and select effective variables by
   evaluating nonlinear relationships among parameters. Moreover, it can be
   further employed as a non-parametric reliable predictive method for
   modeling, controlling, and optimizing complex variables; which to our
   knowledge has never been utilized in the fuel and energy sectors. (C)

Abstract = {{Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a technique that has been featured
   only sporadically in atmospheric science literature. This paper aims to
   demonstrate the utility of AMR for simulating atmospheric flows. Several
   test cases are implemented in a 2D shallow-water model on the sphere
   using the Chombo-AMR dynamical core. This high-order finite-volume model
   implements adaptive refinement in both space and time on a cubed-sphere
   grid using a mapped-multiblock mesh technique. The tests consist of the
   passive advection of a tracer around moving vortices, a steady-state
   geostrophic flow, an unsteady solid-body rotation, a gravity wave
   impinging on a mountain, and the interaction of binary vortices. Both
   static and dynamic refinements are analyzed to determine the strengths
   and weaknesses of AMR in both complex flows with small-scale features
   and large-scale smooth flows. The different test cases required
   different AMR criteria, such as vorticity or height-gradient based
   thresholds, in order to achieve the best accuracy for cost. The
   simulations show that the model can accurately resolve key local
   features without requiring global high-resolution grids. The adaptive
   grids are able to track features of interest reliably without inducing
   noise or visible distortions at the coarse-fine interfaces. Furthermore,
   the AMR grids keep any degradations of the large-scale smooth flows to a
   minimum.}},

Abstract = {{In previous works, a model was developed for the transition of an epoxy
   liquid to a cured solid as a result of the continuous formation of solid
   epoxy networks by crosslinking. The model accounts for volume decrease
   during crosslinking, thermal expansion due to heat generation,
   deformation and stress generation. The networks were assumed to be
   linear thermo-elastic isotropic solids, material properties were deduced
   from the literature, and the model was used to determine the stresses
   generated by curing in a number of examples. The purpose of the present
   work is to revisit the ideas on which this model is based and
   incorporate them into a general framework within the context of
   continuum mechanics. This will show the assumptions that have been made
   in the existing model because of the lack of experimental results and
   also provide a proper framework for extending the model as new
   experimental results are obtained. Each network is now assumed to be a
   nonlinear thermo-viscoelastic solid with its own properties. The
   assumption of small deformations is introduced to lead to a simplified
   model that is linear in the strains.}},

   for Photoacoustic Imaging of Live Cancer Cells}},

Abstract = {{Detection and imaging of single cancer cells is critical for cancer
   diagnosis and understanding of cellular dynamics. Photoacoustic imaging
   (PAI) provides a potential tool for the study of cancer cell dynamics,
   but faces the challenge that most cancer cells lack sufficient
   endogenous contrast. Here, a type of colloidal gold nanoparticles
   (AuNPs) are physically fabricated and are precisely functionalized with
   quantitative amounts of functional ligands (i.e., polyethyleneglycol
   (PEG) and (Arginine(R)-Glycine(G)-Aspartic(D)) 4 (RGD) peptides) to
   serve as an exogenous contrast agent for PAI of single cells. The
   functionalized AuNPs, with a fixed number of PEG but different RGD
   densities, are delivered into human prostate cancer cells. Radioactivity
   and photoacoustic analyses show that, although cellular uptake
   efficiency of the AuNPs linearly increases along with RGD density,
   photoacoustic signal generation efficiency does not and only maximize at
   a moderate RGD density. The functionalization of the AuNPs is in turn
   optimized based on the experimental finding, and single cancer cells are
   imaged using a custom photoacoustic microscopy with high-resolution. The
   quantitatively functionalized AuNPs together with the high-resolution
   PAI system provide a unique platform for the detection and imaging of

Abstract = {{Wireless power transfer for implantable systems must harvest very low
   power levels due to low incident power on human tissues and a small
   receiver coil size. This work proposes resonant current-mode charging to
   reduce minimum harvestable input power and increase power efficiency at
   low input power levels. Avoiding rectification and voltage regulation
   from conventional voltage-mode methods, this work resonates an LC tank
   for multiple cycles to build up energy, then directly charges a battery
   with inductor current. A prototype is fabricated in 0.18 mu m CMOS
   technology. Minimum harvestable input power is 600 nW and maximum power
   efficiency is 67.6\% at 4.2 mu W input power. Power transmission through
   bovine tissue is measured to have negligible efficiency loss, making
   this technique amenable to implantable applications.}},

Abstract = {{Parallel coils at both the transmitter and receiver can be used to offer
   more control over the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system, and this
   implementation has potential to improve the performance in high-field
   MRI. A new MSE-based EXcitation Pattern (MSE-EXP) design for image
   reconstruction in parallel transmit and receive SENSitivity Encoding
   (pTxRx SENSE) MRI is presented in this paper to maximize the performance
   of an MRI using an array of transmit and receive coils. In the the
   small-tip-angle regime, we derive theoretically effective excitation
   patterns for fully-sampled k-space data (with no SNR assumption) and for
   under-sampled k-space data under both low and high SNR assumptions. The
   proposed MSE-EXP-encoded pTxRx SENSE MRI has two main advantages for
   high-field MRI, one is the specific absorption rate (SAR) management
   through prespecification of the global SAR regulatory limit in the
   excitation pattern design weight constraint and an another is the
   imaging acceleration by effective reduction of aliasing artifacts,
   particularly for advanced image reconstruction in highly under-sampled
   pTxRx SENSE MRI in the high-SNR regime. Numerical experiments
   demonstrate that reconstruction accuracy in pTxRx SENSE MRI is
   significantly improved by the proposed MSE-EXP design, but our study
   also identifies several practical challenges associated with generation
   of the proposed MSE-EXP.}},

Abstract = {{High electrical conductivity and large accessible surface area, which
   are required for ideal electrode materials of energy conversion and
   storage devices, are opposed to each other in current materials. It is a
   long-term goal to solve this issue. Herein, we report highly conductive
   porous Naembedded carbon (Na@C) nanowalls with large surface areas,
   which have been synthesized by an invented reaction of CO with liquid
   Na. Their electrical conductivities are 2 orders of magnitude larger
   than highly conductive 3D graphene. Furthermore, almost all their
   surface areas are accessible for electrolyte ions. These unique
   properties make them ideal electrode materials for energy devices, which
   significantly surpass expensive Pt. Consequently, the dye-sensitized
   solar cells (DSSCs) with the Na@C counter electrode has reached a high
   power conversion efficiency of 11.03\%. The Na@C also exhibited
   excellent performance for supercapacitors, leading to high capacitance
   of 145 F g(-1) at current density of 1 A g(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Optimal conditions for blood collection for circulating
   tumor DNA (ctDNA) are still being developed. Although both Strecic and
   EDTA tubes are commonly used, their ability to stabilize ctDNA as a
   function of time and temperature post-collection has not been thoroughly
   studied. Additionally, the potential utility of CellSave tubes (commonly
   used for circulating tumor cell) for ctDNA measurements has not been
   studied.
   Design and methods: Blood was collected into Streck, EDTA, and CellSave
   tubes from ten patients with metastatic breast cancer enrolled in the
   MI-ONCOSEQ tumor sequencing program at the University of Michigan and
   kept either on ice or at room temperature until plasma isolation. Plasma
   was processed after 2, 6, and 48 h post-collection. We used droplet
   digital PCR (ddPCR) to quantify plasma ctDNA and wild-type DNA for six
   patients who had tumor tissue mutations represented in commercially
   available ddPCR assays.
   Results: ctDNA abundance was similar and stable for up to 6 h in all
   tube types, and there was no effect of storage temperature on the yield
   for Streck and EDTA tubes. After 48 h, however, one out of four patients
   with detectable ctDNA showed a 50\% decline in ctDNA in the EDTA tube,
   and three out of six patients showed a 2-3-fold increase in wild-type
   DNA in the EDTA tube.
   Conclusions: Strecic, EDTA, and CellSave tubes showed similar
   performance in preserving ctDNA for up to 6 h before plasma isolation.
   Streck and CellSave tubes more consistently stabilized ctDNA and
   wild-type DNA at 48 h than EDTA tubes. (C) 2016 The Canadian Society of

Abstract = {{The phase field method is proven to be a powerful tool in computational
   fracture mechanics in that it can predict crack nucleation and
   branching, in some cases, without explicitly tracking the crack path.
   However, in such applications as hydraulic fracturing or leakage, it is
   necessary or beneficial to have the crack geometry available. This paper
   presents a variational method to identify the crack path from phase
   field approaches to fracture. The method is proven to be successful not
   only for a simple curved crack but also for multiple and branched
   cracks. The algorithm employs the non-maximum suppression technique, a
   procedure borrowed from the image processing field, to detect a bounding
   area which covers the ridge of the phase field profile. After that, it
   is continued with the step to determine a cubic spline to represent the
   crack path and to improve it via a constrained optimization process. To
   demonstrate the performance of our method, we provide the results with
   three sets of representative examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An amorphous indium-tin-zinc-oxide thin-film transistor (a-ITZO
   TFT)-based voltage-mode active pixel sensor (V-APS) is discussed, for
   the first time, in this paper. The a-ITZO TFT shows superior electrical
   characteristics, including a high field-effect mobility (mu(EFF) > 30
   cm(2)/V . s), a steep subthreshold slope (SS < 200 mV/decade), and a low
   OFF-current (I-OFF < 10(-14) A), that are suitable for applications such
   as X-ray imagers. The proposed V-APS is based on the top-illuminated
   organic photodiode (OPD) or amorphous silicon p(+)-i-n(+) photodiode
   (a-Si p(+)-i-n(+) PD). Simulation results indicate that, in contrast
   with common source V-APS, source follower (SF) V-APS is more desirable
   for X-ray imagers due to its better linearity property. The OPD or the
   a-Si p(+)-i-n(+) PD does not affect the voltage gain of SF V-APS. But
   the PDs have different influences on charge-to-voltage conversion gain.
   The impact of PD capacitances and dark saturation currents on detectable
   quantities of electrons is also investigated. The influence of the TFT
   threshold voltage shift on circuit performance, sensitivity, and noise
   analysis of SF V-APS is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{High-performance control of induction machines in electric drives
   requires accurate knowledge of the machine parameters. While parameters
   have traditionally been identified using the standard no-load and
   locked-rotor tests, performing the locked-rotor test as prescribed in
   the IEEE standard requires special test equipment, and is difficult to
   implement with an inverter due to the low voltages involved. This paper
   presents a new method for induction machine parameter identification,
   including core loss conductance, which is based on fitting steady-state
   experimental data to the stator current locus for various slip
   frequencies in the stator flux linkage reference-frame. Numerical
   analysis confirms the accuracy of the method, while experimental results
   demonstrate its ability to characterize an induction machine over a
   range of flux levels which include magnetic saturation. Finally, it is
   shown that model-based predictions of the steady-state machine behavior
   computed using the parameter estimates provided by the proposed
   technique are more accurate than those obtained using the IEEE standard,
   when compared to measurements of the power factor, three-phase input
   power, and RMS line current.}},

Abstract = {{By performing stability analysis on an optimal runway schedule, this
   paper derives a method to determine whether an optimized landing
   sequence of aircraft remains optimal after an arbitrary number of
   aircraft in that sequence are delayed by an arbitrary amount of time. We
   consider the problem of scheduling aircraft landing on a single runway
   with the objective of maximizing throughput under changing external
   conditions such as delays caused by weather. Instead of optimizing the
   schedule every time delays occur, stability criteria allow for fast
   evaluation of whether schedules remain optimal. This paper develops a
   method to compute stability regions for a set of schedules. Sensitivity
   analysis of the linear programming relaxation and a nonlinear
   relationship between the delay of individual aircraft and the incurred
   cost change for all landing sequences yield the stability information.
   Furthermore, the properties of a first-come-first-serve policy are
   studied by giving sufficient conditions and a heuristic condition for
   the optimality of first-come-first-serve sequences. The given results
   are shown to be also applicable to landing sequences obtained through
   local neighborhood search, sequences that obey a position shift
   constraint, and subsequences of landing sequences as used in a rolling
   horizon approach.}},

Abstract = {{Cavitation plays a significant role in the efficacy of stone comminution
   during shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). Although cavitation on the surface
   of urinary stones helps to improve fragmentation, cavitation bubbles
   along the propagation path may shield or block subsequent shockwaves
   (SWs) and potentially induce collateral tissue damage. Previous in vitro
   work has shown that applying low-amplitude acoustic waves after each SW
   can force bubbles to consolidate and enhance SWL efficacy. In this
   study, the feasibility of applying acoustic bubble coalescence (ABC) in
   vivo was tested. Model stones were percutaneously implanted and treated
   with 2500 lithotripsy SWs at 120 SW/minute with or without ABC.
   Comparing the results of stone comminution, a significant improvement
   was observed in the stone fragmentation process when ABC was used.
   Without ABC, only 25\% of the mass of the stone was fragmented to
   particles <2mm in size. With ABC, 75\% of the mass was fragmented to
   particles <2mm in size. These results suggest that ABC can reduce the
   shielding effect of residual bubble nuclei, resulting in a more
   efficient SWL treatment.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed acoustically activated nanodroplets (NDs) using an
   amphiphilic triblock copolymer, which self-assembles and encapsulates
   different perfluorocarbons including perfluoropentane (PFP) and
   perfluorohexane (PFH). Applying histotripsy pulses (i.e., short, high
   pressure, ultrasound pulses) to solutions of PFP- and PFH-NDs generated
   bubble clouds at a significantly reduced acoustic pressure compared to
   the cavitation pressure observed for histotripsy treatment alone. In
   this report, we summarize the results of combining histotripsy at low
   frequency (345 and 500 kHz) with PFP-NDs and PFH-NDs on the ablation of
   PC-3 and C4-2B prostate cancer cells. Using custom built histotripsy
   transducers coupled to a microscope and a high speed recording camera,
   we imaged the generation of a cavitation bubble cloud in response to
   different ultrasound regimes in solution and in tissue-mimicking gel
   phantoms. We quantified the associated ablation of individual cancer
   cells and 3D spheroids suspended in solution and embedded in tissue
   phantoms to compare the ablative capacity of PFP-NDs and PFH-NDs.
   Results show that histotripsy pulses at high acoustic pressure (26.2
   MPa) ablated 80\% of prostate cancer spheroids embedded in
   tissue-mimicking gel phantoms. In comparison, combining histotripsy
   pulses at a dramatically lower acoustic pressure (12.8 MPa) with PFP-NDs
   and PFH-NDs caused an ablation of 40\% and 80\% of the tumor spheroid
   volumes, respectively. These results show the potential of acoustically
   activated NDs as an image-guided ablative therapy for solid tumors and
   highlight the higher ablative capacity of PFH-NDs, which correlates with
   the boiling point of the encapsulated PFH and the stability of the
   formed bubble cloud.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of electromagnetic and particle irradiation on
   twodimensional materials (2DMs) are discussed in this review. Radiation
   creates defects that impact the structure and electronic performance of
   materials. Determining the impact of these defects is important for
   developing 2DM-based devices for use in high-radiation environments,
   such as space or nuclear reactors. As such, most experimental studies
   have been focused on determining total ionizing dose damage to 2DMs and
   devices. Total dose experiments using X-rays, gamma rays, electrons,
   protons, and heavy ions are summarized in this review. We briefly
   discuss the possibility of investigating single event effects in 2DMs
   based on initial ion beam irradiation experiments and the development of
   2DM-based integrated circuits. Additionally, beneficial uses of
   irradiation such as ion implantation to dope materials or electron-beam
   and helium-beam etching to shape materials have begun to be used on 2DMs
   and are reviewed as well. For non-ionizing radiation, such as low-energy
   photons, we review the literature on 2DM-based photo-detection from
   terahertz to UV. The majority of photo-detecting devices operate in the
   visible and UV range, and for this reason they are the focus of this
   review. However, we review the progress in developing 2DMs for detecting
   infrared and terahertz radiation. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{We study the scheduling of multiple tasks under varying processing costs

   has a due date, and a non-completion penalty cost is incurred if the
   task is not completely processed before its due date. We assume that the
   task arrival process is stochastic and the processing rate is
   capacitated. Our work is motivated by both traditional and emerging
   application domains, such as construction industry and freelance
   consulting industry. We establish the optimality of Shorter Slack time
   and Longer remaining Processing time (SSLP) principle that determines
   the priority among active tasks. Based on the derived structural
   properties, we also propose an effective cost-balancing heuristic policy
   and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed policy through extensive
   numerical experiments. We believe our results provide operators/managers
   valuable insights on how to devise effective service scheduling policies

Abstract = {{Mechanosensation is an important process in biological fluid-structure
   interaction. To understand the biophysics underlying mechanosensation,
   it is essential to quantify the correlation between membrane
   deformation, membrane tension, external fluid shear stress, and
   conformation of mechanosensitive (MS) channels. Smoothed dissipative
   particle dynamics (SDPD) simulations of vesicle/cell in three types of
   flow configurations are conducted to calculate the tension in lipid
   membrane due to fluid shear stress from the surrounding viscous flow. In
   combination with a simple continuum model for an MS channel, SDPD
   simulation results suggest that shearing adhered vesicles/cells is more
   effective to induce membrane tension sufficient to stretch MS channels
   open than a free shear flow or a constrictive channel flow. In addition,
   we incorporate the bilayer-cytoskeletal interaction in a two-component
   model to probe the effects of a cytoskeletal network on the gating of MS

Abstract = {{Because commercial aircraft are built with thin-walled structures, their
   structural performance is well modeled using shell-element meshes.
   However, creating these meshes for the full aircraft configuration can
   be challenging and presents a bottleneck in the design process,
   especially in a configuration-level design space. This paper presents an
   algorithm that automatically creates unstructured quadrilateral meshes
   for the full airframe based on just the description of the desired
   structural members. The approach consists in representing each node in
   the mesh as a linear combination of points on the geometry so that the
   structural mesh morphs as the geometry changes, as it would, for
   example, in aerostructural optimization. The algorithm divides the
   aircraft skin into 4-sided domains based on the underlying B-spline
   representation of the geometry. It meshes each domain independently
   using an algorithm based on constrained Delaunay triangulation, triangle
   merging and splitting to obtain a quadrilateral mesh, and elliptical
   smoothing. Examples of full-configuration structural meshes are
   provided, and a mesh convergence study is performed to show that element
   quality is maintained as the structural mesh is refined. The algorithm
   is available as part of the open-source aircraft geometry tool suite,

Abstract = {{This paper considers gain-scheduled control within a passive systems
   framework. Inspired by the passivity theorem and linear parameter
   varying systems theory, a very strictly passive gain-scheduled
   controller is introduced. The proposed gain-scheduled controller is used
   in tandem with an actuator saturation prevention technique. The actuator
   saturation prevention technique does not violate the passive properties
   of the controller, can account for feedforward control, and can have
   variable saturation limits. Scheduling signals are bounded and square
   integrable on finite time intervals. They have no restrictions on their
   derivatives, can be nonlinear, and can be functions of system states,
   exogenous signals, or time. The controller is applied to a trajectory
   tracking problem of a two-link flexible manipulator's heavy payload. The
   proposed controller is compared to two other gain-scheduling paradigms
   through experimentation. The theoretical and experimental results of
   this paper show that the proposed control architecture with a fixed
   number of integrating states is able to have improved stability
   properties over a traditional linear parameter varying controller
   without compromising performance. In addition, the proposed controller
   is able to asymptotically track a trajectory while avoiding actuator
   saturation.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid powertrain technologies must be applied to sports utility
   vehicles (SUV) and light trucks (LT) in the near future tomeet the new
   corporate average fuel economy standards. For SUV and LT, multimode
   hybrid powertrains using multiple planetary gears (PGs) help to deliver
   the required torque while achieving better fuel economy. Compared with
   single and double PG systems, three-PG system can providemore design
   flexibility. However, it is not practical to search through all possible
   three-PG designs using exhaustive search methods because of the enormous
   size of the design space. In this paper, a rapid structure optimization
   method is proposed. Fuel-saving (FS) modes and high launching
   performance (HLP) modes are first identified through normalized
   efficiency analysis and maximum output torque analysis. Then, a
   constrained optimization problem is defined to limit the mode candidates
   (FS and HLP modes). Following this approach, the design space is reduced
   by a factor of 1000. Three clutch designs are obtained from the designs
   with fewer clutches (one or two) by using the design-extension
   technique. Finally, a case study demonstrates how the proposed method is
   applied to the optimal design of three-PG hybrids.}},

Abstract = {{The portion of clock power in system is rapidly increasing with the
   continuous increasing of clock frequency and clock resources. Last two
   decades, a great research attention has been paid to minimizing the
   clock power. Recently, it is shown that the structure of resonant clock
   networks is very effective in saving power since it can store electric
   energy to the inserted inductors rather than dissipate. On the other
   side, it has been known that dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) is
   one of the most effectively and widely used power reduction techniques.
   However, so far no works have addressed the design methodology problem
   of synthesizing resonant clock networks that are able to operate under
   the designs with DVFS capability even though the problem is potentially
   very important to maximize the synergy effect on saving power. In this
   context, this paper proposes a comprehensive solution to the problem.
   Precisely, we propose a two-phase synthesis algorithm: 1) formulating
   the problem of inductor allocation, placement, and adjustable-sizing to
   support DVFS into a weighted set cover problem with the objective of
   minimizing total area of inductors and 2) followed by performing the
   task of resizing of adjustable driving buffers to support the switch of
   driving strength according to the clock frequencies by DVFS. Through
   experiments with benchmark circuits, it is shown that for designs with
   DVFS using 1 and 3 GHz, our algorithm synthesizes resonant clock
   networks with 25.9\% less power on the execution of the clock frequency,
   which is not supported by resonant clocking in the previous no-DVFS
   aware resonant clock synthesis algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, issues concerning micro-discharge energy generation and
   micro-tool electrode manufacture in traditional micro-electrical
   discharge machining (EDM) are discussed, and a new electrostatic
   field-induced electrolyte jet (E-Jet) micro-electrical machining method

   volatile way to remove material from a substrate, and because it happens
   on such a small scale it is difficult to distinguish the principal
   machining mechanism of this new discharge process. This paper
   investigates the machining mechanism by examining the topology and
   composition constitution of the machined surface obtained using NaCl
   solution and deionized water as the E-jet solution in positive-polarity
   and negative-polarity machining after both single and prolonged
   discharges. Different material removal mechanisms under different
   polarities and discharge times have been disclosed, and conclusions
   concerning the E-Jet EDM control conditions have been drawn.}},

Abstract = {{The mucociliary clearance in the bronchial tree is the main mechanism by
   which the lungs clear themselves of deposited particulate matter. In
   this work, a macroscopic model of the clearance mechanism is proposed.
   Lubrication theory is applied for thin films with both surface tension
   effects and a moving wall boundary. The flow field is computed by the
   use of a finite-volume scheme on an unstructured grid that replicates a
   bronchial bifurcation. The carina in bronchial bifurcations is of
   special interest because it is a location of increased deposition of
   inhaled particles. In this study, the mucus flow is computed for
   different values of the surface tension. It is found that a minimal
   surface tension is necessary for efficiently removing the mucus while
   maintaining the mucus film thickness at physiological levels.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear piecewise restoring force in hydrokinetic power conversion

Abstract = {{Flow Induced Motions (FIMs) of a single, rigid, circular cylinder with
   piecewise continuous restoring force are investigated for Reynolds
   number 24,000 <= Re <= 120,000 with damping, and different piecewise
   functions as parameters. Selective roughness is applied to enhance FIM
   and increase the hydrokinetic energy captured by the VIVACE (Vortex
   Induced Vibration for Aquatic Clean Energy) Converter at higher Reynolds
   numbers. The second generation of virtual spring-damping system Vck,
   developed in the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory (MRELab), enables
   embedded computer-controlled change of viscous-damping and
   spring-stiffness for fast and precise oscillator modeling. Experimental
   results for amplitude response, frequency response, energy harvesting,
   and efficiency are presented and discussed. All experiments were
   conducted in the Low Turbulence Free Surface Water (LTFSW) Channel of
   the MRELab of the University of Michigan. The main conclusions are: (1)
   The nonlinear piecewise spring Converter can harness energy from flows
   as slow as 0.275 m/s with no upper limit. (2) In galloping, the
   nonlinear spring Converter has up to 76\% better performance than its
   linear spring counterpart. (3) The FIM response is predominantly
   periodic for all nonlinear spring functions used. (4) Optimal power
   harnessing is achieved by changing the nonlinear piecewise spring
   function and the linear viscous damping. (5) VIVACE exhibits local
   maxima in power conversion at the end of the upper branch in VIV and the
   highest velocity reached in galloping. (6) The efficiency optima though
   are at the beginning of the VIV initial branch and at the beginning of
   galloping.}},

Abstract = {{In the past few decades, analysis of heart sound signals (i.e. the
   phonocardiogram or PCG), especially for automated heart sound
   segmentation and classification, has been widely studied and has been
   reported to have the potential value to detect pathology accurately in
   clinical applications. However, comparative analyses of algorithms in
   the literature have been hindered by the lack of high-quality,
   rigorously validated, and standardized open databases of heart sound
   recordings. This paper describes a public heart sound database,
   assembled for an international competition, the PhysioNet/Computing in
   Cardiology (CinC) Challenge 2016. The archive comprises nine different
   heart sound databases sourced from multiple research groups around the
   world. It includes 2435 heart sound recordings in total collected from
   1297 healthy subjects and patients with a variety of conditions,
   including heart valve disease and coronary artery disease. The
   recordings were collected from a variety of clinical or nonclinical
   (such as in-home visits) environments and equipment. The length of
   recording varied from several seconds to several minutes. This article
   reports detailed information about the subjects/patients including
   demographics (number, age, gender), recordings (number, location, state
   and time length), associated synchronously recorded signals, sampling
   frequency and sensor type used. We also provide a brief summary of the
   commonly used heart sound segmentation and classification methods,
   including open source code provided concurrently for the Challenge. A
   description of the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016, including the main
   aims, the training and test sets, the hand corrected annotations for
   different heart sound states, the scoring mechanism, and associated open
   source code are provided. In addition, several potential benefits from
   the public heart sound database are discussed.}},

Title = {{In vitro and in vivo assessment of controlled release and degradation of

Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporally controlled release of growth factors (GFs) is critical
   for regenerative processes such as angiogenesis. A common strategy is to
   encapsulate the GF within hydrogels, with release being controlled via
   diffusion and/or gel degradation (i.e., hydrolysis and/or proteolysis).
   However, simple encapsulation strategies do not provide spatial or
   temporal control of GF delivery, especially non-invasive, on-demand
   controlled release post implantation. We previously demonstrated that
   fibrin hydrogels, which are widely used in tissue engineering and GF
   delivery applications, can be doped with perfluorocarbon emulsion, thus
   yielding an acoustically responsive scaffold (ARS) that can be modulated
   with focused ultrasound, specifically via a mechanism termed acoustic
   droplet vaporization. This study investigates the impact of ARS and
   ultrasound properties on controlled release of a surrogate payload
   (i.e., fluorescently-labeled dextran) and fibrin degradation in vitro
   and in vivo. Ultrasound exposure (2.5 MHz, peak rarefactional pressure:
   8 MPa, spatial peak time average intensity: 86.4 mW/cm(2)), generated up
   to 7.7 and 21.7-fold increases in dextran release from the ARSs in vitro
   and in vivo, respectively. Ultrasound also induced morphological changes
   in the ARS. Surprisingly, up to 2.9-fold greater blood vessel density
   was observed in ARSs compared to fibrin when implanted subcutaneously,
   even without delivery of pro-angiogenic GFs. The results demonstrate the
   potential utility of ARSs in generating controlled release for tissue
   regeneration.
   Statement of Significance
   Simple encapsulation of a molecular payload within a conventional
   hydrogel scaffold does not provide spatial or temporal control of
   payload release. Yet, spatiotemporally controlled release of bioactive
   payloads is critical for tissue regeneration, which often utilizes
   hydrogel scaffolds to facilitate processes such as angiogenesis. This
   work investigates the design and performance (both in vitro and in vivo)
   of hydrogel scaffolds where release of a fluorescent payload is
   non-invasively and spatiotemporally-controlled using focused ultrasound.
   We also quantitatively characterize the degradation and vascularization
   of the scaffolds. Our results may be of interest to groups working on
   controlled release strategies for implants, especially within the field
   of tissue engineering. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Title = {{Stretchable degradable and electroactive shape memory copolymers with
   tunable recovery temperature enhance myogenic differentiation}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{234-244}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Development of flexible degradable electroactive shape memory polymers
   (ESMPs) with tunable switching temperature (around body temperature) for
   tissue engineering is still a challenge. Here we designed and
   synthesized a series of shape memory copolymers with electroactivity,
   super stretchability and tunable recovery temperature based on
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) with different molecular weight and
   conductive amino capped aniline trimer, and demonstrated their potential
   to enhance myogenic differentiation from C2C12 myoblast cells. We
   characterized the copolymers by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FT-IR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance CH NMR), cyclic voltammetry
   (CV), ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), shape memory test, tensile test and in vitro
   enzymatic degradation study. The electroactive biodegradable shape
   memory copolymers showed great elasticity, tunable recovery temperature
   around 37 degrees C, and good shape memory properties. Furthermore,
   proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts were investigated
   on electroactive copolymers films, and they greatly enhanced the
   proliferation, myotube formation and related myogenic differentiation
   genes expression of C2C12 myoblasts compared to the pure PCL with
   molecular weight of 80,000. Our study suggests that these electroactive,
   highly stretchable, biodegradable shape memory polymers with tunable
   recovery temperature near the body temperature have great potential in
   skeletal muscle tissue engineering application.
   Statement of Significance
   Conducting polymers can regulate cell behavior such cell adhesion,
   proliferation, and differentiation with or without electrical
   stimulation. Therefore, they have great potential for electrical signal
   sensitive tissue regeneration. Although conducting biomaterials with
   degradability have been developed, highly stretchable and electroactive
   degradable copolymers for soft tissue engineering have been rarely
   reported. On the other hand, shape memory polymers (SMPs) have been
   widely used in biomedical fields. However, SMPs based on polyesters
   usually are biologically inert. This work reported the design of super
   stretchable electroactive degradable SMPs based on polycaprolactone and
   aniline trimer with tunable recovery temperature around body
   temperature. These flexible electroactive SMPs facilitated the
   proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells compared with
   polycaprolactone, indicating that they are excellent scaffolding
   biomaterials in tissue engineering to repair skeletal muscle and
   possibly other tissues. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

   Both sensitivity analysis formulations make use of the same iterative

   an analogous coupling strategy. The fully coupled aeroelastic analysis
   formulation is first verified to effectively perform performance
   predictions of a four-bladed rotor in forward flight started impulsively

   intensities and phase-averaged velocity magnitudes have been obtained in
   the downstream region of the fan to represent the basic flow features
   for each defined case. An array of microphones was used to measure the
   acoustic emissions created by the axial fan. A beamforming technique has
   been used to properly represent the fan acoustic emissions from the
   recorded acoustic data. Self-noise signatures of the propagated sound,
   corresponding to the defined cases, have been obtained in the range of
   200-8000 Hz. Acoustic data and their links to 1) the physics of the
   flows, 2) aerodynamic loading, and 3) fan rotational speed are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Polynomial basis functions are the ubiquitous workhorse of high-order
   finite element methods, but their generality comes at a price of high
   computational cost and fragility in the face of underresolution. In this
   paper, a method is presented for constructing a posteriori tailored,
   generally nonpolynomial, basis functions for approximating a solution
   and computing outputs of a system of equations. This method is similar
   to solution-based adaptation, in which elements of the computational
   mesh are sized and oriented based on characteristics of the solution.
   The method takes advantage of existing infrastructure in high-order
   methods: the reference-to-global mapping used in constructing curved
   elements. By optimizing this mapping, elements are warped to make them
   ideally suited for representing a target solution or computing a scalar
   output from the solution. Guidelines on generating a good initial guess
   and choosing a generalized set of optimization parameters are provided
   to minimize tuning time and to introduce automation into the process.
   For scalar advection-diffusion and Navier-Stokes problems, it is shown
   that warped elements can offer significant accuracy benefits without
   increasing the degrees of freedom in the system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a two-step linear solution scheme to find an
   optimum metallic microstructure satisfying performance needs and
   manufacturability constraints. The microstructure is quantified using
   the orientation distribution function, which determines the volume
   densities of crystals that make up the polycrystal microstructure. The
   orientation distribution function of polycrystalline alloys is
   represented in a discrete form using finite elements, and the
   volume-averaged properties are computed. The first step of the solution
   approach identifies the orientation distribution functions that lead to
   the set of optimal engineering properties using linear programming. This
   step leads to multiple solutions, of which only a few can be
   manufactured using traditional processing routes such as rolling and
   forging. In the second step, textures from a given process are
   represented in a space of reduced basis coefficients called the process
   plane. This step involves generation of orthogonal basis functions for
   representing spatial variations of the orientation distribution
   functions during a given process using proper orthogonal decomposition.
   Multiple orientation distribution function solutions in step one are
   then projected onto these basis functions to identify which of the
   optimal textures are feasible through a given manufacturing process.
   This feasibility is determined with two approaches. The first approach
   finds the closest match to the orientation distribution function
   solutions in the material plane, whereas the second approach finds the
   closest match to a desired set of properties instead of the orientation
   distribution functions. The method is explained through an example of
   vibration tuning of a galfenol alloy, with the primary objective of
   maximizing the yield strength.}},

Title = {{Integrating Natural Language Processing and Spatial Reasoning for
   Utility Compliance Checking}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Underground utility incidents, such as utility conflicts and utility
   strikes, result in time and cost overruns in construction projects,
   property damages, environmental pollution, personnel injuries, and
   fatalities. A main cause of recurrent utility incidents is the
   noncompliance with the spatial configurations between utilities and
   their surroundings. Utility specifications usually contain textual
   descriptions of the spatial configurations. However, detection of
   spatial defects, according to the textual descriptions, is difficult and
   time consuming. This deficiency is because of the lack of spatial
   cognition in many rule-checking systems to process massive amounts of
   data. This study aims to automate utility compliance checking by
   integrating natural language processing (NLP) and spatial reasoning. NLP
   algorithm translates the textual descriptions of spatial configurations
   into computer-processable spatial rules. Spatial reasoning executes the
   extracted spatial rules following a logical order in a geographical
   information system (GIS) to identify noncompliance. The intellectual
   contribution of this study is twofold. First, complex spatial rules are
   retrieved automatically from textual data with their hierarchies
   classified, which provides the inputs and indicates the sequence of rule
   execution in spatial reasoning. Second, semantic spatial relations are
   modeled on the basis of their metric and topological implications,
   enabling the automatic execution of multiple spatial rules. Experiments
   were conducted to test this framework. The average precision, recall,
   and combination of the two (F-measure) achieved by the NLP algorithm for
   extracting spatial rules are 87.88\%, 79.09\%, and 83.25\%,
   respectively. In addition, the spatial reasoning mechanism also was
   found to be a powerful tool for compliance checking under various
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive model for the index void ratios emax and emin of sands
   is presented. It is based on a large set of previously published sand
   properties as well as tests on 25 new materials including glass spheres
   and two types of rice. The new model uses the index void ratios of
   perfectly uniform spherical glass beads as baselines to which factors
   accounting for the three most influential intrinsic soil properties are
   applied. The three properties are particles roundness, R, sphericity, S,
   and the coefficient of uniformity, Cu. The following three factors led
   to the new model's improvement over previous such efforts: (1)use of
   sands spanning a wide range of R, S, and Cu values; (2)consideration of
   the combined and coupled effects of R, S, and Cu; and (3)utilization of
   a recently developed computational geometry method on digital images to
   obtain precise values of R and S for large, statistically reliable
   numbers of particles.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of the increase in ductility in bulk metallic glass matrix
   composites over monolithic bulk metallic glasses is to date little
   understood, primarily because the interplay between dislocations in the
   crystalline phase and shear bands in the glass could neither be imaged
   nor modelled in a validated way. To overcome this roadblock, we show
   that shear bands can be imaged in three dimensions by atom probe
   tomography from density variations in the reconstructed atomic density,
   which density-functional theory suggests being a local-work function
   effect. Imaging of near-interface shear bands in Ti48Zr20V12Cu5Be15 bulk
   metallic glass matrix composite permits measurement of their
   composition, thickness, branching and interactions with the dendrite
   interface. These results confirm that shear bands here nucleate from
   stress concentrations in the glass due to intense, localized plastic
   deformation in the dendrites rather than intrinsic structural
   inhomogeneities.
   Lay description Bulk metallic glass matrix composites combine the
   structure and properties of two different phases: a metallic glass phase
   and a crystalline phase, making them both strong and ductile. How can we
   better design these materials so they deform without breaking is the key
   question of this paper, which we address by imaging locally the regions
   where the material has deformed. Because of the complex arrangement of
   the two phases, we use an imaging technique (atom probe tomography) that
   provides 3D spatial information and we are able to reveal local
   deformation at the atomic scale, which we support and confirm using
   modelling.}},

Abstract = {{Localization of deformation, a precursor to failure in solids, is a
   crucial and hence widely studied problem in solid mechanics. The
   continuum modeling approach of this phenomenon studies conditions on the
   constitutive laws leading to the loss of ellipticity in the governing
   equations, a property that allows for discontinuous equilibrium
   solutions. Micro-mechanics models and nonlinear homogenization theories
   help us understand the origins of this behavior and it is thought that a
   loss of macroscopic (homogenized) ellipticity results in localized
   deformation patterns. Although this is the case in many engineering
   applications, it raises an interesting question: is there always a
   localized deformation pattern appearing in solids losing macroscopic
   ellipticity when loaded past their critical state?
   In the interest of relative simplicity and analytical tractability, the
   present work answers this question in the restrictive framework of a
   layered, nonlinear (hyperelastic) solid in plane strain and more
   specifically under axial compression along the lamination direction. The
   key to the answer is found in the homogenized post-bifurcated solution
   of the problem, which for certain materials is supercritical (increasing
   force and displacement), leading to post-bifurcated equilibrium paths in
   these composites that show no localization of deformation for
   macroscopic strain well above the one corresponding to loss of
   ellipticity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-Recently developed acoustic tweezing cytometry uses
   ultrasound-responsive targeted microbubbles for biomechanical
   stimulation of live cells at the subcellular level. The purpose of this
   research was to estimate the viscoelastic characteristics of cells from
   the displacements of cell-bound microbubbles in response to ultrasound
   pulses on acoustic tweezing cytometry.
   Methods-Microbubbles were bound to NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and ATDC5 cells
   through an integrin-cytoskeleton linkage. The evolution of microbubble
   behaviors under irradiation by ultrasound pulses was captured by a
   high-speed camera and tracked by a customized algorithm. The total
   damping constant, stiffness, and rigidity of the cells were estimated by
   fitting the measured temporal displacement profiles to a KelvinVoigt-
   based model.
   Results-The mean maximum displacement of the microbubbles attached to
   NIH/3T3 fibroblasts was much greater than that for ATDC5 cells. The mean
   fitted damping constant and stiffness +/- SD for ATDC5 cells were 28.16
   +/- 7.08 mg/s and 0.5041 +/- 0.1381 mN/m, respectively, and the values
   for NIH/3T3 fibroblasts were 13.12 +/- 4.23 mg/s and 0.2591 +/- 0.0715
   mN/m. The rigidity for ATDC5 cells was 331.46 +/- 106.50 MPa, whereas
   that for NIH/3T3 fibroblasts was 117.92 +/- 34.83 MPa.
   Conclusions-The Arg-Gly-Asp-integrin-cytoskeleton system of NIH/3T3
   fibroblasts appears to be softer than that of ATDC5 cells. The rigidity
   of ATDC5 cells was significantly greater than that of NIH/3T3
   fibroblasts at the 95\% confidence level. This strategy provides a novel
   way to determine the viscoelastic properties of the live cells.}},

Abstract = {{Most current photoacoustic imaging (PAI) systems employ piezoelectric
   transducers to receive photoacoustic signals, which requires coupling
   medium to facilitate photoacoustic wave propagation and are not favored
   in many applications. Here, we report an all-optical non-contact PAI
   system based on a commercial heterodyne interferometer working at 1550
   nm. The interferometer remotely detects ultrasound-induced surface
   vibration and does not involve any physical contact with the sample. The
   theoretically predicated and experimentally measured noise equivalent
   detection limits of the optical sensor are about 4.5 and 810 Pa over 1.2
   MHz bandwidth. Using a raster-scan PAI system equipped with the
   non-contact design, stereotactic boundaries of an artificial tumor in a
   pig brain were accurately delineated. The non-contact design also
   enables the tomographic PAI of biological tissue samples in a
   non-invasive manner. The preliminary results and analyses reveal that
   the heterodyne interferometer-based non-contact PAI system holds good
   potential in biomedical imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Most server-grade systems provide Chipkill-Correct error protection at
   the expense of power and performance. In this paper we present a low
   overhead solution to improving the reliability of commodity DRAM systems
   with no change in the existing memory architecture. Specifically, we
   propose five erasure and error correction (E-ECC) schemes that provide
   at least Chipkill-Correct protection for x4 (Schemes 1, 2 and 3), x8
   (Scheme 4) and x16 (Scheme 5) DRAM systems. All schemes have superior
   error correction performance due to the use of strong symbol-based
   codes. Synthesis results in 28 nm node show that the decoding latency of
   these codes is negligible compared to the DRAM access latency. In
   addition, we make use of erasure codes to extend the lifetime of the
   DRAM systems. Specifically, once a chip is marked faulty due to
   persistent errors, all E-ECC schemes correct erasures due to that faulty
   chip and also correct an additional random error in a second chip.
   Evaluation with SPEC2006 workloads show that compared to x4
   Chipkill-Correct schemes, Scheme 5 has the highest IPC improvement (mean
   of 7 percent) and Scheme 4 has the largest power reduction (mean of 18
   percent) and the largest increase in energy efficiency (mean of 25
   percent).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, state estimation of a single degree of freedom flexible
   cable-actuated system governed by nonlinear equations of motion is
   considered. State estimation formulations are developed in discrete time
   using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an unscented Kalman filter
   (UKF). Measurements of the payload acceleration and either the angular
   position of one or both winches are obtained by an accelerometer mounted
   on the payload and angular winch encoders. These sensors are relatively
   small and inexpensive, and allow for operation in many different
   environments. This is an improvement over current estimation techniques
   for cable-actuated systems that typically rely on a position
   measurements of the payload that are obtained by large and expensive
   sensors that often only operate in a particular environment (e.g.,
   motion capture system, GPS receiver). An EKF and UKF are implemented to
   estimate the states of the system using a nonlinear dynamic model. A
   proportional-derivative-based controller from the literature is used for
   control. Estimation of the tension in each cable is also performed,
   which demonstrates that additional sensors (e.g., load cells) are not
   needed to obtain an accurate estimate of the cable tensions.
   Consideration of sensors with different sampling rates is also included
   in the EKF and UKF formulations. Simulation results using the EKF and
   UKF along with the proportional-derivative controller in discrete time
   are presented. (C) 2016 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to provide a model that is an extension of
   classic scheduling problems for a tandem queueing system by including
   customer impatience. In such scenarios, the server(s) must balance
   abandonments from each phase of service with the need to prioritize
   higher reward customers. This presents an interesting challenge since
   the trade-off between the cost of abandonments and revenue maximization
   is not at all clear. As a result of customer abandonments, traditional
   solution techniques are not available. In particular, uniformization is
   not possible since the transition rates are unbounded. We do our
   analysis in continuous time, using the continuous-time Markov decision
   process framework to discern simple relationships of the value functions
   depending on the starting state. We then use sample path arguments to
   analyze the structure of the optimal policy. We provide conditions under
   which an optimal policy is nonidling and never splits servers (except to
   avoid idling). We then consider the single-server model as a proxy for
   the decision problem when there are more customers at each station than
   there are servers. In this case, we provide conditions under which it is
   optimal to prioritize each station.}},

Abstract = {{Motor responses to unexpected external perturbations require the
   adjustment of the motor commands driving the ongoing activity.
   Strategies can be learned with practice to compensate for these
   unpredictable perturbations (e.g., externally induced slips and trips).
   It has been hypothesized that response improvements reflect the
   adaptation of motor commands through updates of an internal model. This
   hypothesis may be nuanced when a pre-existing motor response could be
   used. In that case, since a relatively adequate response is known, only
   the timing of the command needs to be determined. If so, then it could
   be inferred that the timing of movement initiation and the specific
   sequence of motor commands can be dissociated. Previously, we quantified
   the benefits of cuing vs. learning on recovery motor responses resulting
   from a trip induced by the abrupt stop of one side of a split belt
   treadmill. Trip occurrence was randomized within a series of strides.
   Two groups of young adults participated to two distinct experiments
   (learning, cuing). In the learning experiment, trip recovery improved
   progressively from the 4th to the 8th trial to reach an ``adapted
   response{''}. In the cuing experiment, trip recovery was immediate (from
   1st trial). Expanding from these results, the aim of the present work
   was to differentiate the processes underlying the generation of motor
   compensation strategies in response to an external perturbation under
   time uncertainty. A supplementary analysis revealed that ``cued{''}
   responses were kinematically similar to the ``adapted response{''} and
   remained invariant regardless of cue lead time (250, 500 ms before trip)
   and application location of the cue (arm, trunk, lower leg). It is
   posited that all responses (cued and non-cued) are the expression of a
   pre-existing motor program derived from life experiences. Here, the cue
   significantly reduces time uncertainty and adaptation consists primarily
   in resolving time uncertainty based on the trial-by-trial learning of
   the stochastic property of trip occurrence in order to reduce the
   response delay. Hence, response time delay and motor program parameters
   appear to stem from two distinct processes.}},

Title = {{Long-Lasting Changes in Muscle Twitch Force During Simulated Work While
   Standing or Walking}},
Journal = {{HUMAN FACTORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1117-1127}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-lasting
   effects of prolonged standing work on a hard floor or floor mat and
   slow-pace walking on muscle twitch force (MTF) elicited by electrical
   stimulation.
   Background: Prolonged standing work may alter lower-leg muscle function,
   which can be quantified by changes in the MTF amplitude and duration
   related to muscle fatigue. Ergonomic interventions have been proposed to
   mitigate fatigue and discomfort; however, their influences remain
   controversial.
   Method: Ten men and eight women simulated standing work in 320-min
   experiments with three conditions: standing on a hard floor or an
   antifatigue mat and walking on a treadmill, each including three seated
   rest breaks. MTF in the gastrocnemius-soleus muscles was evaluated
   through changes in signal amplitude and duration.
   Results: The significant decrease of MTF amplitude and an increase of
   duration after standing work on a hard floor and on a mat persisted
   beyond 1 hr postwork. During walking, significant MTF metrics changes
   appeared 30 min postwork. MTF amplitude decrease was not significant
   after the first 110 min in any of the conditions; however, MTF duration
   was significantly higher than baseline in the standing conditions.
   Conclusion: Similar long-lasting weakening of MTF was induced by
   standing on a hard floor and on an antifatigue mat. However, walking
   partially attenuated this phenomenon.
   Application: Mostly static standing is likely to contribute to
   alterations of MTF in lower-leg muscles and potentially to
   musculoskeletal disorders regardless of the flooring characteristics.
   Occupational activities including slow-pace walking may reduce such
   deterioration in muscle function.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the stability issue of economic model
   predictive control (EMPC) for constrained nonlinear systems and propose
   a new contractive constraint formulation of nonlinear EMPC schemes. This
   formulation is one of Lyapunov-based approaches in which the contractive
   function chosen a priori can be used as a Lyapunov function. Some
   conditions are given to guarantee recursive feasibility and asymptotic
   stability of the EMPC. Moreover, we analyze the transient economic
   performance of the EMPC closed-loop system in some finite-time
   intervals. The proposed EMPC scheme is applied to a chemical reactor
   model to illustrate its utility and benefits. Copyright (c) 2016 John

   ignition (HCCI) regime, before returning to spark-ignition (SI)
   combustion. To enable multimode operation in the HEV, the supervisory
   control strategy has to maintain the battery's state-of-charge while
   accounting for the SI/HCCI combustion mode switch. In this study four

   consumption minimization strategy by the mode switching decision. (C)

Abstract = {{Atomic scale study of the character and motion of dislocations in Al2Cu
   will provide in-sights into understanding the superior mechanical
   properties of Al-Al2Cu alloys. Using atomistic simulations, we studied
   seven potential slip systems (110)< 001 >, (010)< 001 >, (310)< 001 >,
   (010)< 100 >, (110)< 1 (1) over bar0 >, (110)1/2 < 1 (1) over bar1 > and
   (112)1/2 <(11) over bar1 > in Al2Cu with body centered tetragonal
   structure. We found that three edge dislocations with Burgers vector <
   001 > on glide planes (110), (010), and (310), show an extended core and
   are predicted to be glissile at room and moderate temperatures. Other
   four edge dislocations associated with slip systems (010)< 100 >, (110)<
   1 (1) over bar0 >, (110)1/2 < 1 (1) over bar1 > and (112)1/2 <(11) over

   >, and 1/2 <(11) over bar1 > show a condensed core, and exhibit
   significantly higher Peierls barrier for glide at room temperature.
   Furthermore, the interaction of dislocation dipole associated with slip
   system (110)< 001 > results in the climb of the extended-core
   dislocation at room temperature through three stages: the extended core
   condenses, the leading partial dislocation climbs accompanying the
   creation of vacancies (resulting in a non-planar core), and the two
   partials with non-planar core collectively glide on the neighboring slip
   planes associated with atomic shuffles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper provides closed-form expressions for the process zone lengths
   and load-displacement responses of cohesive zone modeling, for the
   popular mode I double cantilever beam (DCB) test, the mode II end
   notched flexure (ENF) test and the mixed-mode I/II bending (MMB) test of
   composite materials. By incorporating traction-separation laws that
   consist of only one quasi-brittle softening segment, the problems are
   formulated and analytically solved for homogenous material or mid-plane
   symmetric laminates within the framework of classical lamination theory
   (CLT). The solutions of the MMB test are obtained by the superposition
   method. Having been known as depending on the mode mixity, the material
   and interfacial fracture properties, the process zone length is found as
   a system parameter that is also influenced by the specimen geometry,
   including the thickness and the crack length, especially for mode II.
   Based on the parametric studies and the comparison against finite

Abstract = {{We present a method for the quantitative comparison of two surfaces,
   applicable to temporal and/or spatial extent in one or two dimensions.
   Often surface comparisons are simply overlaid graphs of results from
   different methodologies that are qualitative at best; it is the purpose
   of this work to facilitate quantitative evaluation. The surfaces can be
   analytical, numerical, and/or experimental, and the result returned by
   the method, termed surface similarity parameter or normalized error, has
   been normalized so that its value lies between zero and one. When the
   parameter has a value of zero, the surfaces are in perfect agreement,
   whereas a value of one is indicative of perfect disagreement. To provide
   insight regarding the magnitude of the parameter, several canonical
   cases are presented, followed by results from breaking water wave
   experimental measurements with numerical simulations, and by a
   comparison of a prescribed, periodic, square-wave surface profile with
   the subsequent manufactured surface.}},

Abstract = {{Infinite horizon optimization (IHO) problems present a number of
   challenges for their solution, most notably, the inclusion of an

   its solution by solving increasingly longer finite horizon truncations

   novel transformation that reduces the infinite dimensional IHO problem
   into an equivalent one dimensional optimization problem, i.e.,
   minimizing a Holder continuous objective function with known parameters
   over a closed and bounded interval of the real line. We exploit the
   characteristics of the transformed problem in one dimension and
   introduce an algorithm with a graphical implementation for solving the
   underlying infinite dimensional optimization problem.}},

Title = {{Tracing Multiple Solution Branches for Nonlinear Ordinary Differential

Abstract = {{Nonlinear differential and integral equations often have multiple
   solution branches. Reliable sofware to find all roots of a system of
   polynomial equations, as generated by standard discretizations for
   differential equations with polynomial nonlinearity, are now widely
   available. It is now feasible to pursue a global, all-branches attack on
   differential and integral equations. Unfortunately, both the number of
   solutions and computational cost grow exponentially fast with N, the
   number of degrees of freedom. And what if the nonlinearity is not
   polynomial? And how to continue from small-N to large N? Here, we show
   that Chebyshev and Fourier Petrov-Galerkin methods are
   ``N-minimizing{''}, but especially with exploitation of
   cryptoperiodicity, parity and other symmetries, basis recombination, and
   unconventional Gegenbauer polynomial Petrov-Galerkin weights. We also
   show that Chebyshev-Pad, technology is efficient at
   ``polynomializing{''} transcendental nonlinearity. If the small-N
   solution is sufficiently accurate, continuation to larger N is a simple
   matter of initializing Newton's iteration for large N with the solution
   for small N ({''}modal persistence{''}). When this fails, we introduce
   Newton-DISH: a Degree-Increasing Spectral Homotopy which is slower but
   more resilient. The major limitation is that present-day all-branches
   polynomial system solvers are limited, due to both operation count and
   memory storage, to rather modest N, typically 4-20, which we dub . If
   the interesting branches can be resolved at least crudely by degrees of
   freedom, then the solutions can be refined to high accuracy by DISH.
   However, solution branches that demand for even a poor approximation lie
   outside the scope of the strategy described here. Our theme is not that
   the ``all-roots{''} strategy is universally applicable, but rather that
   its domain of usefulness is greatly expanded by using spectral methods
   in lieu of low order finite differences and finite elements. We
   demonstrate the power of the polynomial-solver and Chebyshev partnership
   by finding a hitherto unsuspected second branch (smooth and real-valued)
   of the Sag-Haselgrove nonlinear integral equation, which has been
   studied for more than half a century.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding alloying effects on the irradiation response of structural
   materials is pivotal in nuclear engineering. To systematically explore
   the effects of Fe concentration on the irradiation-induced defect
   evolution and hardening in face-centered cubic Ni-Fe binary solid
   solution alloys, single crystalline Ni-xFe (x = 0-60 at\%) alloys have
   been grown and irradiated with 1.5 MeV Ni ions. The irradiations have
   been performed over a wide range of fluences from 3 x 10(13) to 3 x
   10(16) cm(-2) at room temperature. Ion channeling technique has shown
   reduced damage accumulation with increasing Fe concentration in the low
   fluence regime, which is consistent to the results from molecular
   dynamic simulations. No irradiation-induced compositional segregation
   was observed in atom probe tomography within the detection limit, even
   in the samples irradiated with high fluence Ni ions. Transmission
   electron microscopy analyses have further demonstrated that the defect
   size significantly decreases with increasing Fe concentration,
   indicating a delay in defect evolution. Furthermore, irradiation induced
   hardening has been measured by nanoindentation tests. Ni and the Ni-Fe
   alloys have largely different initial hardness, but they all follow a
   similar trend for the increase of hardness as a function of irradiation
   fluence. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Single dose of bisphosphonate preserves gains in bone mass following

   model}},
Journal = {{BONE}},

Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{79-85}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sclerostin antibody has demonstrated a bone-forming effect in
   pre-clinical models of osteogenesis imperfecta, where mutations in
   collagen or collagen-associated proteins often result in high bone
   fragility in pediatric patients. Cessation studies in osteoporotic
   patients have demonstrated that sclerostin antibody, like intermittent
   PTH treatment, requires sequential anti-resorptive therapy to preserve
   the anabolic effects in adult populations. However, the persistence of
   anabolic gains from either drug has not been explored clinically in 01,
   or in any animal model. To determine whether cessation of sclerostin
   antibody therapy in a growing OI skeleton requires sequential
   anti-resorptive treatment to preserve anabolic gains in bone mass, we
   treated 3 week old Brtl/+ and wild type mice for 5 weeks with SclAb, and
   then withdrew treatment for an additional 6 weeks. Trabecular bone loss
   was evident following cessation, but was preserved in a dose-dependent
   manner with single administration of pamidronate at the time of
   cessation. In vivo longitudinal near-infrared optical imaging of
   cathepsin K activation in the proximal tibia suggests an anti-resorptive
   effect of both SclAb and pamidronate which is reversed after three weeks
   of cessation. Cortical bone was considerably less susceptible to
   cessation effects, and showed no structural or functional deficits in
   the absence of pamidronate during this cessation period. In conclusion,
   while SclAb induces a considerable anabolic gain in the rapidly growing
   Brtl+ murine model of 01, a single sequential dose of antiresorptive
   drug is required to maintain bone mass at trabecular sites for 6 weeks
   following cessation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. We combined implantation of multi-channel templated agarose
   scaffolds with growth factor gene delivery to examine whether this
   combinatorial treatment can enhance peripheral axonal regeneration
   through long sciatic nerve gaps. Approach. 15 mm long scaffolds were
   templated into highly organized, strictly linear channels, mimicking the
   linear organization of natural nerves into fascicles of related
   function. Scaffolds were filled with syngeneic bone marrow stromal cells
   (MSCs) secreting the growth factor brain derived neurotrophic factor
   (BDNF), and lentiviral vectors expressing BDNF were injected into the
   sciatic nerve segment distal to the scaffold implantation site. Main
   results. Twelve weeks after injury, scaffolds supported highly linear
   regeneration of host axons across the 15 mm lesion gap. The
   incorporation of BDNF-secreting cells into scaffolds significantly
   increased axonal regeneration, and additional injection of viral vectors
   expressing BDNF into the distal segment of the transected nerve
   significantly enhanced axonal regeneration beyond the lesion.
   Significance. Combinatorial treatment with multichannel bioengineered
   scaffolds and distal growth factor delivery significantly improves
   peripheral nerve repair, rivaling the gold standard of autografts.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{88-96}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Here we describe development of a silicone rubber/stainless steel mesh
   cage implant system, much like that used to assess biocompatibility of
   biomaterials {[}1], for easy removal of injectable polymer micro spheres
   in vivo. The sterile cage has a type 316 stainless steel mesh size (38
   gm) large enough for cell penetration and free fluid flow in vivo but
   small enough for microsphere retention, and a silicone rubber shell for
   injection of the microspheres. Two model drugs, the poorly soluble
   steroid, triamcinolone acetonide, and the highly water-soluble
   luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) peptide superagonist,
   leuprolide, were encapsulated in PLGA microspheres large enough (63-90
   mu m) to be restrained' by the cage implant in vivo. The in vitro
   release from both formulations was followed by ultra performance liquid
   chromatography (UPLC) with and without the cage in a standard release
   media, PBS pH 7.4 + 0.02\% Tween 80 0.05\% sodium azide, at 37 degrees
   C. Pharmacokinetics (PM) in rats was assessed after SC injection or SC
   in-cage implantation of microspheres with plasma analysis by LC-MS/MS or
   EIA. Tr-A and leuprolide in vitro release was largely unaffected after
   the initial, burst irrespective of the cage or test tube incubation
   vessel and release was much slower than observed in vivo for both drugs.
   Moreover, Tr-A and leuprolide pharmacokinetics with and without the cage
   were highly similar during the 2-3 week release duration before a
   significant inflammatory response was caused by the cage implant. Hence,
   the PM-validated cage implant provides a simple means to recover and
   evaluate the microsphere drug carriers in vivo during a time window of
   at least a few weeks in order to characterize the polymer microsphere
   release and erosion behavior in vivo. This approach may facilitate
   development of mechanism-based in vitro/in vivo correlations and enable
   development of more accurate and useful in vitro release tests. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In a network of interdependent users, the expenditure in security
   measures by an entity affects not only herself, but also other users
   interacting with her. As a result, users' efforts toward security can be
   viewed as a public good; the optimal provision of which in a system of
   self-interested entities requires the design of appropriate incentives
   through an external mechanism. In this paper, we propose the notion of
   exit equilibrium to study users' voluntary participation in such
   incentive mechanisms. We show a fundamental result that, due to the
   non-excludable nature of security, there exists no reliable mechanism,
   which can incentivize socially optimal investments, while ensuring
   voluntary participation and maintaining a weakly balanced budget, for
   all instances of security games. To further illustrate this result, we
   analyze the performance of two well-known incentive mechanisms, namely
   the Pivotal (VCG) and Externality mechanisms, in security games. We
   illustrate how, given a mechanism, stable coalitions of participating
   users may emerge, leading to an improved, yet sub-optimal security
   status. We further extend the impossibility result to risk-averse users,
   and discuss its implications on the viability of using cyber-insurance
   contracts to improve the state of cyber security.}},

Abstract = {{A consistent ``2D/1D{''} neutron transport method is derived from the 3D
   Boltzmann transport equation, to calculate fuel-pin-resolved neutron
   fluxes for realistic full-core Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) problems.
   The 2D/1D method employs the Method of Characteristics to discretize the
   radial variables and a lower order transport solution to discretize the
   axial variable. This paper describes the theory of the 2D/1D method and
   its implementation in the MPACT code, which has become the whole-core
   deterministic neutron transport solver for the Consortium for Advanced
   Simulations of Light Water Reactors (CASL) core simulator VERA-CS.
   Several applications have been performed on both leadership-class and
   industry-class computing clusters. Results are presented for whole-core
   solutions of the Watts Bar Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 and compared to
   both continuous-energy Monte Carlo results and plant data. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{He atoms tend to cluster and precipitate into bubbles that prefer to
   grow in the grain boundaries, resulting in high temperature He
   embrittlement with significantly degraded material properties. This is a
   major bottleneck in employing Ni-based alloys for applications such as
   molten salt reactors (MSRs). This paper focuses on understanding how the
   local grain boundary structure interacts with He atoms and how the local
   atomistic environment in the grain boundary influences the binding
   energy of He defects. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have
   investigated the trapping capability of the Ni Sigma 3(1 (1) over
   bar2){[}110] grain boundary to He defects (HeN) and to He-vacancy
   defects (HeNVM). The two defects in the Ni grain boundary exhibit
   geometries with high symmetry. The binding energy of an interstitial He
   atom to HeNVM defects is found to be generally larger in pure Ni than
   that in the grain boundary. We compared the binding energy of HeN
   defects to the Ni vacancy and to the Ni grain boundary, finding that the
   Ni vacancy possesses a higher trapping strength to HeN. We also found
   that the binding strength of HeN to the grain boundary is stronger than
   that of HeNVM to the grain boundary. The He-vacancy ratio in HeNVM
   defects does not significantly affect the binding energy in the grain
   boundary plane. The current work will provide insight in understanding
   the experimentally observed He bubble formation in Ni-based alloys and
   bridge atomic scale events and damage with macroscopic failure.}},

Abstract = {{The paper intends to present a design of a double-blade mixer for the
   purpose of reinforce concrete mixing quality. The result of comparison
   experiment on mixing quality of three different types of concrete with
   the use of different mixers shows that mixing quality of the concrete
   using a double-blade mixer is better than that of using ordinary biaxial
   mixer. The compressive strength of C20 with filling rate of 31\% is
   improved by 14.8\% and that of C30 by 14.2\%. Moreover, the compressive
   strength of roller compacted concrete is increased by 13.7\%. The
   double-blade mixer used in macrostructure and SEM of the concrete could
   provide good binding to both the aggregates and the cement paste with
   few cracks between them which would form crushing destruction of its
   aggregate instead of interface. Furthermore, the double-blade mixer
   could provide faster uniform mixing at macro- and microscales, reinforce
   concrete microstructure and improve its compressive strength.}},

Abstract = {{The role of crack initiation and short crack growth on fatigue life in
   the very high cycle fatigue regime (VHCF) is investigated for three heat
   treatments of the wrought magnesium alloy WE43. As-received (T5) WE43
   with a relatively fine grain size was solution treated and aged to
   produce precipitation strengthened coarse-grained microstructures in the
   underaged and peak-aged (T6) conditions. Ultrasonic axial fatigue tests
   with a cyclic frequency of 20 kHz were conducted using smooth specimens.
   Heat treatment was shown to have a strong effect on fatigue strength,
   with the fine-grained, strain hardened T5 condition exhibiting much
   higher values than the coarse-grained conditions. No significant
   difference in fatigue strength was observed between the underaged and
   peak-aged microstructures of equivalent grain size. Crack initiation and
   short crack growth behaviors in each condition were investigated to
   determine if one of these behaviors dominated the VHCF lives. It was
   found that average short crack growth rates for the three conditions
   were similar and had no clear dependence on microstructural condition.
   Crack initiation was shown to occur through cyclic slip deformation in
   particularly large and favorably oriented grains in each condition.
   Subsurface crack initiation was observed at low stresses and high
   lifetimes in the coarse-grained conditions, but not in the fine grained
   T5 condition. Crack growth rates in vacuum were investigated using a
   unique combination of ultrasonic fatigue instrumentation and scanning
   electron microscopy (UFSEM) in order to simulate subsurface crack
   propagation. Environment was shown to have a significant effect on crack
   growth rate, with rates in vacuum nearly two orders of magnitude lower
   than in laboratory air. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Chronic in vivo stability assessment of carbon fiber microelectrode
   arrays}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Individual carbon fiber microelectrodes can record unit
   activity in both acute and semi-chronic (similar to 1 month) implants.
   Additionally, new methods have been developed to insert a 16 channel
   array of carbon fiber microelectrodes. Before assessing the in vivo
   long-term viability of these arrays, accelerated soak tests were carried
   out to determine the most stable site coating material. Next, a
   multi-animal, multi-month, chronic implantation study was carried out
   with carbon fiber microelectrode arrays and silicon electrodes.
   Approach. Carbon fibers were first functionalized with one of two
   different formulations of PEDOT and subjected to accelerated aging in a
   heated water bath. After determining the best PEDOT formula to use,
   carbon fiber arrays were chronically implanted in rat motor cortex. Some
   rodents were also implanted with a single silicon electrode, while
   others received both. At the end of the study a subset of animals were
   perfused and the brain tissue sliced. Tissue sections were stained for
   astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. The local reactive responses were
   assessed using qualitative and quantitative methods. Main results.
   Electrophysiology recordings showed the carbon fibers detecting unit
   activity for at least 3 months with average amplitudes of similar to 200
   mu V. Histology analysis showed the carbon fiber arrays with a minimal
   to non-existent glial scarring response with no adverse effects on
   neuronal density. Silicon electrodes showed large glial scarring that
   impacted neuronal counts. Significance. This study has validated the use
   of carbon fiber microelectrode arrays as a chronic neural recording
   technology. These electrodes have demonstrated the ability to detect
   single units with high amplitude over 3 months, and show the potential
   to record for even longer periods. In addition, the minimal reactive
   response should hold stable indefinitely, as any response by the immune
   system may reach a steady state after 12 weeks.}},

Title = {{Likely frost events at Gale crater: Analysis from MSL/REMS measurements}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{280}},
Pages = {{93-102}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We provide indirect evidence for the formation of frost at the surface
   of Gale crater by analyzing the highest confidence data from
   simultaneous measurements of relative humidity and ground temperature
   during the first 1000 sols of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission.
   We find that except for sol 44, frost events could have occurred only
   between sols 400 and 710, corresponding to the most humid and coldest
   time of the year (from early fall to late winter). In particular,
   measurements at Dingo Gap during sols 529-535, at an unnamed place
   during sols 554-560, at Kimberley during sols 609-617 and at an unnamed
   place during sols 673-676 showed the largest likelihood of the
   occurrence of frost events. At these four locations, the terrain is
   composed of fine-grained and loosely packed material with thermal
   inertia values of similar to 200 SI units, much lower than the 365 +/-
   50 SI units value found at the landing ellipse. This is important
   because terrains with exceptionally low thermal inertia favor the
   formation of frost by lowering minimum daily ground temperatures. An
   order-of-magnitude calculation to determine the thickness of the frost
   layer at these four locations results in values of tenths of pm, while
   the precipitable water content is a few pr-mu m. Therefore, surface
   frost events can have important implications for the local water cycle
   at Gale crater. In addition, frost is the most likely type of water that
   can be temporarily found in bulk amounts on the surface of Mars at low
   latitudes and therefore can cause weathering, influencing the geology of
   Gale crater. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We report a novel fabrication and multiple high resolution
   characterizations of Cu2ZnSnSe4 solar cells. The fabrication is based on
   nanoparticle precursor production by liquid-phase pulsed laser ablation
   (LPPLA), electrophoretic deposition of precursor thin film under ambient
   condition, and selenization. Columnar grain boundaries are studied using
   spatially mapped Raman spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy for
   their compositional and electrical properties. We observe high
   electrical conductivity near columnar grain boundaries, and propose poor
   Cu composition as the cause of the enhancement of the collection of
   minority carriers. We also study horizontal grain boundaries using
   cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
   Combining with the device I-V and quantum efficiency, we suggest that
   the horizontal grain boundaries act as barriers to the transportation of
   minority carriers. CZTSe cells with efficiencies of 4.77\% and 2.20\%
   are compared. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{936-959}},

Abstract = {{Flow Induced Motions (FIMs) of a single, rigid, circular cylinder with
   end-springs are investigated for Reynolds number 30,000 <= Re <= 120,000
   with mass ratio, damping, and stiffness as parameters. Selective
   roughness is applied to enhance FIM and increase the hydrokinetic energy
   captured by the VIVACE (Vortex Induced Vibration for Aquatic Clean
   Energy) Converter at higher Reynolds numbers. The second generation of
   virtual spring-damping system Vck, recently developed in the Marine
   Renewable Energy Laboratory (MRELab), enables embedded
   computer-controlled change of viscous-damping and spring stiffness for
   fast and precise oscillator modeling. Experimental results for amplitude
   response, frequency response, energy harvesting, and efficiency are
   presented and discussed. All experiments were conducted in the Low
   Turbulence Free Surface Water (LTFSW) Channel of the MRELab of the
   University of Michigan. The main conclusions are: (1) The oscillator can
   harness energy from flows as slow as 0.3946 m/s with no upper limit. (2)
   Increasing the spring stiffness, shifts the VIV synchronization range to
   higher flow velocities, resulting in reduced gap between VIV and
   galloping, where the harnessed power drops. (3) In galloping, the
   harnessed power increases with the mass ratio. (4) Local optima in
   energy conversion efficiency appear at the beginning of the VIV upper
   branch and at the beginning of galloping. (5) Local optima in power
   appear at the end VIV upper branch and at the beginning of galloping.

Abstract = {{Titanium (Ti) alloys are one of the most appropriate metals for
   bio-medical applications, specifically in making implants. However, the
   high difference between the stiffness of the Ti alloys and compact bone
   results in stress shielding of the bone and stress concentration at the
   implant, both of which are undesirable and could result in implant
   failure. One method to reduce the stiffness of a dense implants and
   avoid the stress shielding is adding porosity to the structure. This
   however results in considerable reduction in the toughness of the
   structure, which is also undesirable for the long-term success of
   implants. In this work, we study a new method for independently tuning
   the stiffness and toughness of the material by adding various polymers
   to the additively manufactured porous Ti structures. Porous Ti samples
   with two levels of porosity are fabricated through additive
   manufacturing. Three different types of thermoplastic polymers are
   utilized to fill the pores and make the titanium-polymer composite
   parts. Compression simulations and tests. are performed on both porous
   and composite specimens to compare the mechanical behavior of these
   structures. Various finite element simulations are conducted on
   different structures and the results are verified with experiments.
   Simulation results and experimental findings indicate that filling
   porous Ti with thermoplastic polymers leads to an increase in the
   toughness of the structure. The percentage increase of the toughness is
   assessed as a function of the polymer toughness and the level of
   porosity in various samples. Our results pave the way for designing
   polymer-composite structures with independently tunable stiffness and
   toughness for being employed in a broad range of applications. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a combined inductive and capacitive wireless power
   transfer (WPT) system with LC-compensated topology for electric vehicle
   charging application. The circuit topology is a combination of the
   LCC-compensated inductive power transfer (IPT) system and the
   LCLC-compensated capacitive power transfer (CPT) system. The working
   principle of the combined circuit topology is analyzed in detail,
   providing the relationship between the circuit parameters and the system
   power. The design of the inductive and capacitive coupling is
   implemented by the finite-element analysis. The equivalent circuit model
   of the coupling plates is derived. A 3.0-kW WPT system is designed and
   implemented as an example of combined inductive and capacitive coupling.
   The inductive coupler size is 300 mm x 300 mm and the capacitive coupler
   is 610 mm x 610 mm. The air-gap distance is 150 mm for both couplers.
   The output power of the combined system is the sum of the IPT and CPT
   system. The prototype has achieved 2.84-kW output power with 94.5\%
   efficiency at 1-MHz switching frequency, and performs better under
   misalignment than the IPT System. This demonstrates that the

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a four-plate compact capacitive coupler and its

   maintain a large coupling capacitance, and they are of different sizes
   to maintain the coupling between the primary and secondary sides. The
   circuit model of the coupler is presented, considering all six coupling
   capacitors. The LCL compensation topology is used to resonate with the
   coupler and provide high voltage on the plates to transfer high power.
   The circuit-model of the coupler is simplified to design the parameters
   of the compensation circuit. Finite-element analysis is employed to
   simulate the coupling capacitance and design the dimensions of the
   coupler. The circuit performance is simulated in LTspice to design the

Abstract = {{We present an interesting phenomenon, ``atomic force masking{''}, which
   is the deposition of a few-nanometer-thick gold film on ultrathin
   low-molecular-weight (LMW) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) engineered on a
   polycrystalline gold thin film, and demonstrated the formation of hot
   spot based on SERS. The essential principle of this atomic force masking
   phenomenon is that an LMW PDMS layer on a single crystalline grain of
   gold thin film would repel gold atoms approaching this region during a
   second cycle of evaporation, whereas new nucleation and growth of gold
   atoms would occur on LMW PDMS deposited on grain boundary regions. The
   nanostructure formed by the atomic force masking, denoted here as ``hot
   spots on grain boundaries{''} (HOGs), which is consistent with
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation, and the mechanism of
   atomic force masking were investigated by carrying out systematic
   experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were made
   to carefully explain the related fundamental physics. Also, to highlight
   the manufacturing advantages of the proposed method, we demonstrated the

Title = {{Mechanism-Based Development of a Low-Potential, Soluble, and Cyclable
   Multielectron Anolyte for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries}},

Abstract = {{The development of nonaqueous redox flow a batteries (NRFBs) has been
   impeded by a lack of electroactive compounds (anolytes and catholytes)
   with the necessary combination of (1) redox potentials that exceed the
   potential limits of water, (2) high solubility in nonaqueous media, and
   (3) high stability toward electrochemical cycling. In addition, ideal
   materials would maintain all three of these properties over multiple
   electron transfer events, thereby providing a proportional increase in
   storage capacity. This paper describes the mechanism-based design of a
   new class of metal coordination complexes (MCCs) as anolytes for NRFBs.
   The tridentate bipyridylimino isoindoline (BPI) ligands of these
   complexes were designed to enable multielectron redox events. These
   molecules were optimized using a combination of systematic variation of
   the BPI ligand and the metal center along with mechanistic
   investigations of the decomposition pathways that occur during
   electrochemical cycling. Ultimately, these studies led to the
   identification of nickel BPI complexes that could undergo stable
   charge-discharge cycling (<5\% capacity loss over 200 cycles) as well as
   a derivative that possesses the previously unprecedented combination of
   high solubility (>700 mM in CH3CN), multiple electron transfers at low
   redox potentials (-1.7 and 1.9 V versus Ag/Ag+), and high stability in
   the charged state for days at high concentration. Overall, the studies
   described herein have enabled the identification of a promising anolyte
   candidate for NRFBs and have also provided key insights into chemical
   design principles for future classes of MCC-based anolytes.}},

Abstract = {{The self-assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) is essential for emerging
   dispersion-based energy-conscious technologies. Of particular interest
   are micro- and macro scale self-organizing superstructures that can
   bridge 2D/3D processing scales. Here we report the spontaneous assembly
   of CdTe NPs within an aqueous microdroplet suspended in soybean oil. The
   gradual diffusion of the water into the surrounding medium results in
   shrinking of the microdroplet, and a concomitant formation of branched
   assemblies from CdTe NPs that evolve in size from similar to 50 mu m to
   similar to 1000 mu m. The fractal dimension of NP assemblies increases
   from similar to 1.7 to similar to 1.9 during the assembly process. We
   found that constituents of the soybean oil enter the aqueous solution
   across the microdroplet interface and affect NP assembly. The obtained
   NP dendrites can be further altered morphologically by illumination with
   light that results in the disassembly of the NP dendrites. The use of
   this microheterogeneous dispersion platform with partially soluble
   hydrophilic and hydrophobic solvents highlights the sensitivity of the
   NP assembly process to environment and presents an opportunity to
   explore droplet-confined NP assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Pine Island Glacier has undergone several major iceberg calving events
   over the past decades. These typically occurred when a rift at the
   heavily fractured shear margin propagated across the width of the ice
   shelf. This type of calving is common on polar ice shelves, with no
   clear connection to ocean-ice dynamic forcing. In contrast, we report on
   the recent development of multiple rifts initiating from basal crevasses
   in the center of the ice shelf, resulted in calving further upglacier
   than previously observed. Coincident with rift formation was the sudden
   disintegration of the ice melange that filled the northern shear margin,
   resulting in ice sheet detachment from this margin. Examination of ice
   velocity suggests that this internal rifting resulted from the
   combination of a change in ice shelf stress regime caused by
   disintegration of the melange and intensified melting within basal
   crevasses, both of which may be linked to ocean forcing.}},

Abstract = {{Enabling ultra-high energy density rechargeable Li batteries would have
   widespread impact on society. However the critical challenges of Li
   metal anodes (most notably cycle life and safety) remain unsolved. This
   is attributed to the evolution of Li metal morphology during cycling,
   which leads to dendrite growth and surface pitting. Herein, we present a
   comprehensive understanding of the voltage variations observed during Li
   metal cycling, which is directly correlated to morphology evolution
   through the use of operando video microscopy. A custom-designed
   visualization cell was developed to enable operando synchronized
   observation of Li metal electrode morphology and electrochemical
   behavior during cycling. A mechanistic understanding of the complex
   behavior of these electrodes is gained through correlation with
   continuum-scale modeling, which provides insight into the dominant
   surface kinetics. This work provides a detailed explanation of (1) when
   dendrite nucleation occurs, (2) how those dendrites evolve as a function
   of time, (3) when surface pitting occurs during Li electrodissolution,
   (4) kinetic parameters that dictate overpotential as the electrode
   morphology evolves, and (5) how this understanding can be applied to
   evaluate electrode performance in a variety of electrolytes. The results
   provide detailed insight into the interplay between morphology and the
   dominant electrochemical processes occurring on the Li electrode surface
   through an improved understanding of changes in cell voltage, which
   represents a powerful new platform for analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Alloying of two metals is commonly used to create nanomaterials with
   unique physical and chemical properties. The ability to synthesize
   well-mixed bimetallic alloy nanoparticles, however, is often limited by
   the intrinsic immiscibility of metals. To overcome this issue, extreme
   synthesis conditions, using high energy gamma radiation or very high
   temperatures, have been employed to trap metal atoms of immiscible
   metals in well-mixed alloy nanostructures. Herein, we demonstrate a more
   benign synthesis strategy for creating well-mixed bimetallic
   nanoparticles of immiscible metals. We demonstrate a formation of Ag-Pt
   bimetallic nanoparticles through the visible-light mediated reduction of
   a hollow bimetallic oxide precursor containing Ag and Pt oxide. We
   exploit the optical properties of Ag by using visible light to excite
   surface plasmon resonance to drive the reduction of the Pt oxide thereby
   destabilizing the bimetallic precursor. Under the influence of resonant
   light the hollow bimetallic precursor restructures forming well-mixed
   Ag-Pt alloy nanoparticles.}},

Title = {{Energetics of vacancy segregation to {[}100] symmetric tilt grain
   boundaries in bcc tungsten}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{The harsh irradiation environment poses serious threat to the structural
   integrity of leading candidate for plasma-facing materials, tungsten
   (W), in future nuclear fusion reactors. It is thus essential to
   understand the radiation-induced segregation of native defects and
   impurities to defect sinks, such as grain boundaries (GBs), by
   quantifying the segregation energetics. In this work, molecular statics
   simulations of a range of equilibrium and metastable {[}100] symmetric
   tilt GBs are carried out to explore the energetics of vacancy
   segregation. We show that the low-angle GBs have larger absorption
   length scales over their high-angle counterparts. Vacancy sites that are
   energetically unfavorable for segregation are found in all GBs. The
   magnitudes of minimum segregation energies for the equilibrium GBs vary
   from -2.61 eV to -0.76 eV depending on the GB character, while those for
   the metastable GB states tend to be much lower. The significance of
   vacancy delocalization in decreasing the vacancy segregation energies
   and facilitating GB migration has been discussed. Metrics such as GB
   energy and local stress are used to interpret the simulation results,
   and correlations between them have been established. This study
   contributes to the possible application of polycrystalline W under
   irradiation in advanced nuclear fusion reactors.}},

Title = {{Visualizing epithelial expression of EGFR in vivo with distal scanning
   side-viewing confocal endomicroscope}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Confocal endomicroscopy is an emerging imaging technology that has
   recently been introduced into the clinic to instantaneously collect
   ``optical biopsies{''} in vivo with histology-like quality. Here, we
   demonstrate a fast scanner located in the distal end of a side-viewing
   instrument using a compact lens assembly with numerical aperture of 0.5
   to achieve a working distance of 100 mu m and field-of-view of 300 x 400
   mu m(2). The microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror was designed
   based on the principle of parametric resonance and images at 5 frames
   per second. The instrument has a 4.2 mm outer diameter and 3 cm rigid
   length, and can pass through the biopsy channel of a medical endoscope.
   We achieved real time optical sections of NIR fluorescence with 0.87 mu
   m lateral resolution, and were able to visualize in vivo binding of a
   Cy5.5-labeled peptide specific for EGFR to the cell surface of
   pre-cancerous colonocytes within the epithelium of dysplastic crypts in
   mouse colon. By performing targeted imaging with endomicroscopy, we can
   visualize molecular expression patterns in vivo that provide a
   biological basis for disease detection.}},

   gap is only 29 meV higher in energy, which explains the strong near-edge
   absorption. Our calculations verify the anisotropy of the absorption
   onset and explain the range (4.4-5.0 eV) of experimentally reported

   indicate that intrinsic light emission in the deep-ultra-violet (UV)

Title = {{Plasma formation in diode pumped alkali lasers sustained in Cs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{In diode pumped alkali lasers (DPALs), lasing action occurs on the
   resonant lines of alkali atoms following pumping by broadband
   semiconductor lasers. The goal is to convert the efficient but usually
   poor optical quality of inexpensive diode lasers into the high optical
   quality of atomic vapor lasers. Resonant excitation of alkali vapor
   leads to plasma formation through the excitation transfer from the P-2
   states to upper lying states, which then are photoionized by the pump
   and intracavity radiation. A first principles global model was developed
   to investigate the operation of the He/Cs DPAL system and the
   consequences of plasma formation on the efficiency of the laser. Over a
   range of pump powers, cell temperatures, excitation frequency, and mole
   fraction of the collision mixing agent (N-2 or C2H6), we found that
   sufficient plasma formation can occur that the Cs vapor is depleted.
   Although N-2 is not a favored collisional mixing agent due to large
   rates of quenching of the P-2 states, we found a range of pump
   parameters where laser oscillation may occur. The poor performance of
   N-2 buffered systems may be explained in part by plasma formation. We
   found that during the operation of the DPAL system with N-2 as the
   collisional mixing agent, plasma formation is in excess of 10(14)-10(15)
   cm(-3), which can degrade laser output intensity by both depletion of
   the neutral vapor and electron collisional mixing of the laser levels.

Title = {{A highly efficient, stable, durable, and recyclable filter fabricated by
   femtosecond laser drilling of a titanium foil for oil-water separation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{It has been a long standing challenge to efficiently separate oil and
   water since prehistoric times, and now it has become even more desirable
   in oily wastewater purification and oil spill cleanup. Here we introduce
   a super oil-water separation filter with superhydrophilicity and
   underwater superoleophobicity, fabricated using femtosecond laser
   micro-hole drilling of a titanium foil. Such a simply-made filter,
   without any modification, can achieve a separation efficiency exceeding
   99\% in eight typical oil-water mixtures. It remains highly efficient
   after 40 cycles of recycling and after suffering erosion by corrosive
   media. Furthermore, the used filter, polluted with oil, could be
   recovered by ultraviolet illumination. The flux of filtered water is
   tunable by simply selecting the aperture of the microhole or the spacing
   between adjacent microholes. Such advanced functionality is due to
   roughness and the TiO2 layers on the ablated surface during fabrication.
   With superhydrophilic and superoleophobic surfaces, this oil-water filer
   is also suitable for applications in anti-fouling, anti-smudge,
   anti-fog, and self-cleaning.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS}},

Volume = {{832}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{We present a multi-spacecraft approach to test the predictions of recent
   studies on the effect of solar wind expansion on the radial spectral,
   variance, and local 3D anisotropies of the turbulence. We found that on
   small scales (5000-10,000 km) the power levels of the B-trace structure
   functions do not depend on the sampling direction with respect to the
   radial suggesting that on this scale the effect of expansion is small
   possibly due to fast turbulent timescales. On larger scales (110-135
   R-E), the fluctuations of the radial magnetic field component are
   reduced by similar to 20\% compared to the transverse (perpendicular to
   radial) ones, which could be due to expansion confining the fluctuations
   into the plane perpendicular to radial. For the local 3D spectral
   anisotropy, the B-trace structure functions showed dependence on the
   sampling direction with respect to radial. The anisotropy in the
   perpendicular plane is reduced when the increments are taken
   perpendicular with respect to radial, which could be an effect of
   expansion.}},

Title = {{Determination of the essential activity elements of an asbestos

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{414-426}},

Abstract = {{Asbestos is now known to be extremely carcinogenic. Nevertheless, there
   has been a lack of research related to the asbestos management system in
   the event of a disaster. Therefore, the objective of this study is to
   determine the essential activity elements of asbestos management system
   and their priorities when disasters occur, in order to respond to the
   potential for asbestos damage during a disaster. As a starter, it
   extracted 44 activity elements of asbestos management system against
   disaster through literature review. It then selected 4 essential
   elements in rough classification, 11 in intermediate classification and
   25 in detailed classification via delphi method, and quantified weighted
   values of the essential activity elements and their priority by using
   fuzzy analytic hierarchy process technique. `Prevention activity' in the
   rough classification, `law and system improvement' in intermediate
   classification, and `related law and legal system improvement' in the
   detailed classification took the highest priority in each classification
   with weighted values standing at 0.63, 0.447 and 0.371, respectively.
   This is a significant study because it quantified the essential elements
   in asbestos management system by using delphi method and fuzzy analytic
   hierarchy process technique when there was no quantified asbestos
   management system anywhere in the world. The essential activity elements
   identified in the paper could help decision-makers select an appropriate
   disaster management system (e.g, supply chain management). Also, each
   quantified factor could provide a new direction for disaster management,
   and allow for a comprehensive management plan that considers the issue
   of asbestos. Finally, the weighted value of essential activity elements
   determined in this study will be an effective indicator for assessing
   any asbestos management system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Shear-coupled grain boundary (GB), migration is an efficacious
   plasticity mechanism in nanocrystalline materials. However, the
   atomistic aspects of this kind of GB motion have received far less
   attention in bcc metals than that in fcc ones. In this work, we have
   investigated the shear-coupled migration (SCM) of Sigma 13{[}100]01 (5)
   over bar) and Sigma 85{[}100]07 (6) over bar) GBs in bcc tungsten using
   atomistic simulations. We demonstrate that the SCM of the two GBs
   proceeds via the collective glide of GB dislocations along the < 100 >
   and < 111 > directions, respectively. The magnitudes of the GB migration
   depend on system lateral dimension, temperature and GB dislocation
   character. Nudged elastic band calculations in combination with the
   dynamic simulations give the elementary processes of the SCM and show
   that the shear strength and thermal resistance of the < 100 > mode GB is
   much higher than the < 111 > one, consistent with the fact that the <
   100 > dislocations are much more difficult to glide than the 1/2 < 111 >
   dislocations. This conclusion is further supported by the simulation
   results of GB random walk behavior under the free boundary condition.
   The present results demonstrate that the atomistic SCM process is
   fundamentally related to the character of GB dislocations. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In the present work, numerical simulations were conducted for a typical
   end-to-side distal graft anastomosis to assess the effects of inducing
   secondary flow, which is believed to remove unfavourable flow
   environment. Simulations were carried out for four models, generated
   based on two main features of `out-of-plane helicity' and `spiral ridge'
   in the grafts as well as their combination. Following a qualitative
   comparison against in vitro data, various mean flow and hemodynamic
   parameters were compared and the results showed that helicity is
   significantly more effective in inducing swirling flow in comparison to
   a spiral ridge, while their combination could be even more effective. In
   addition, the induced swirling flow was generally found to be increasing
   the wall shear stress and reducing the flow stagnation and particle
   residence time within the anastomotic region and the host artery, which
   may be beneficial to the graft longevity and patency rates. Finally, a
   parametric study on the spiral ridge geometrical features was conducted,
   which showed that the ridge height and the number of spiral ridges have
   significant effects on inducing swirling flow, and revealed the
   potential of improving the efficiency of such designs.}},

Abstract = {{The Magnetospheric Multiscale mission (MMS) targets the characterization
   of fine-scale current structures in the Earth's tail and magnetopause.
   The high speed of these structures, when traversing one of the MMS
   spacecraft, creates magnetic field signatures that cross the sensitive
   frequency bands of both search coil and fluxgate magnetometers. Higher
   data quality for analysis of these events can be achieved by combining
   data from both instrument types and using the frequency bands with best
   sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio from both sensors. This can be
   achieved by a model-based frequency compensation approach which requires
   the precise knowledge of instrument gain and phase properties. We
   discuss relevant aspects of the instrument design and the ground
   calibration activities, describe the model development and explain the
   application on in-flight data. Finally, we show the precision of this
   method by comparison of in-flight data. It confirms unity gain and a
   time difference of less than 100 mu s between the different magnetometer
   instruments.}},

Abstract = {{The equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is known to be an
   important source of interannual variability in the middle-and
   high-latitude stratosphere. The influence of the QBO on the
   stratospheric polar vortex in particular has been extensively studied.
   However, the impact of the QBO on the winds of the midlatitude
   mesosphere is much less clear. We have applied 13 years (2002-2014) of
   data from the Saskatoon Super Dual Auroral Radar Network HF radar to
   show that there is a strong QBO signature in the midlatitude mesospheric
   zonal winds during the late winter months. We find that the Saskatoon
   mesospheric winds are related to the winds of the equatorial QBO at 50
   hPa such that the westerly mesospheric winds strengthen when QBO is
   easterly, and vice versa. We also consider the situation in the late
   winter Saskatoon stratosphere using the European Centre for Medium-Range
   Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim reanalysis data set. We find that the
   Saskatoon stratospheric winds between 7 hPa and 70 hPa weaken when the
   equatorial QBO at 50 hPa is easterly, and vice versa. We speculate that
   gravity wave filtering from the QBO-modulated stratospheric winds and
   subsequent opposite momentum deposition in the mesosphere plays a major
   role in the appearance of the QBO signature in the late winter Saskatoon
   mesospheric winds, thereby coupling the equatorial stratosphere and the
   midlatitude mesosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Charge-carrier mobilities in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) organic
   thin-film transistors (OTFTs) increase 5-fold when OTFTs composed of
   P3HT films on trichloro (1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorooctyl) silane (FTS)
   monolayers supported on SiO2 dielectric substrates (P3HT/FTS/SiO2/Si)
   are subjected to supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) processing. In
   contrast, carrier mobilities in P3HT/octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)/SiO2
   OTFTs processed using scCO(2) are comparable to mobilities measured in
   as-cast P3HT/OTS/SiO2/Si devices. Topographical images of the free and
   buried interfaces of P3HT films reveal that scCO(2) selectively alters
   the P3HT morphology near the buried P3HT/FTS-SiO2 interface; identical
   processing has negligible effects at the P3HT/OTS-SiO2 interface. A
   combination of spectroscopic ellipsometry and grazing-incidence Xray
   diffraction experiments indicate insignificant change in the orientation
   distribution of the intermolecular pi-pi stacking direction of P3HT/FTS
   with scCO(2) processing. The improved mobilities are instead correlated
   with enhanced in-plane orientation of the conjugated chain backbone of
   P3HT after scCO(2) annealing. These findings suggest a strong dependence
   of polymer processing on the nature of polymer/substrate interface and
   the important role of backbone orientation toward dictating charge
   transport of OTFTs.}},

Abstract = {{Ion implantation is a versatile technique to tailor the surface
   properties of polymers in a controlled manner. In the present study,
   samples of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) have been implanted with
   400 keV silver (Ag+) ion beam to various ion fluences ranging from 5 x
   10(13) to 5 x 10(15) ions/cm(2). The effect of Ag+ ion-induced disorder
   on morphological, chemical and optical properties of PMMA is analyzed
   using Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.
   Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of pristine and implanted PMMA
   is measured using four probe apparatus. The AFM images revealed the
   growth of nano-sized grainy structures and hillocks above the surface of
   implanted PMMA. The FTIR spectra confirmed the modifications in chemical
   structure of PMMA along with the formation of -C=C- carbon contents. The
   refractive index, extinction coefficient and photoconductivity of
   implanted PMMA have been found to increase as a function of ion fluence.
   Simultaneously, indirect optical band gap is reduced from 3.13 to 0.81
   eV at a relatively high fluence (5 x 10(15) ions/cm(2)). A linear

Abstract = {{The nuclear envelope (NE) in lower eukaryotes such as
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe undergoes large morphology changes during
   closed mitosis. However, which physical parameters are important in
   governing the shape evolution of the NE, and how defects in the dividing
   chromosomes/microtubules are reflected in those parameters, are
   fundamental questions that remain unresolved. In this study, we show
   that improper separation of chromosomes in genetically deficient cells
   leads to membrane tethering or asymmetric division in contrast to the
   formation of two equal-sized daughter nuclei in wild-type cells. We
   hypothesize that the poleward force is transmitted to the nuclear
   membrane through its physical contact with the separated sister
   chromatids at the two spindle poles. A theoretical model is developed to
   predict the morphology evolution of the NE where key factors such as the
   work done by the poleward force and bending and surface energies stored
   in the membrane have been taken into account. Interestingly, the
   predicted phase diagram, summarizing the dependence of nuclear shape on
   the size of the load transmission regions, and the pole-to-pole distance
   versus surface area relationship all quantitatively agree well with our
   experimental observatiOns, suggesting that this model captures the
   essential physics involved in closed mitosis.}},

Abstract = {{Mars Science Laboratory's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) investigation
   has measured all of the stable isotopes of the heavy noble gases krypton
   and xenon in the martian atmosphere, in situ, from the Curiosity Rover
   at Gale Crater, Mars. Previous knowledge of martian atmospheric krypton
   and xenon isotope ratios has been based upon a combination of the Viking
   mission's krypton and xenon detections and measurements of noble gas
   isotope ratios in martian meteorites. However, the meteorite
   measurements reveal an impure mixture of atmospheric, mantle, and
   spallation contributions. The xenon and krypton isotopic measurements
   reported here include the complete set of stable isotopes, unmeasured by
   Viking. The new results generally agree with Mars meteorite measurements
   but also provide a unique opportunity to identify various
   non-atmospheric heavy noble gas components in the meteorites. Kr
   isotopic measurements define a solar-like atmospheric composition, but
   deviating from the solar wind pattern at Kr-80 and Kr-82 in a manner
   consistent with contributions originating from neutron capture in Br.
   The Xe measurements suggest an intriguing possibility that isotopes
   lighter than Xe-132 have been enriched to varying degrees by spallation
   and neutron capture products degassed to the atmosphere from the
   regolith, and a model is constructed to explore this possibility. Such a
   spallation component, however, is not apparent in atmospheric Xe trapped
   in the glassy phases of martian meteorites. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The current study presents an experimental validation of jet aviation
   fuel surrogates formulated using a surrogate model-optimizer. Two
   surrogate fuel mixtures are used to emulate a practical Jet-A (POSF
   4658) considering a series of physical and chemical processes in diesel
   engines. The surrogate mixtures consist of:
   n-dodecane/isocetane/methylcyclohexane (MCH)/toluene
   0.3844/0.1484/0.2336/0.2336 on a molar basis (referred to as UM I), and
   n-dodecane/isocetane/decalin/toluene 0.2897/0.1424/0.3188/0.2491 on a
   molar basis (referred to as UM II). In the present study, a modified
   Cooperative Fuels Research (CFR) Octane Rating engine and an optically
   accessible, constant-volume spray combustion chamber are employed to
   investigate how the chemical and physical properties of these jet fuel
   surrogate mixtures affect the fundamental ignition behavior as compared
   to the targeted full boiling range Jet-A fuel (POSF 4658). The
   observations of ignition behavior include critical compression ratio and
   critical equivalence ratio, and \% low temperature heat release, which
   are assessed using the motored engine (CFR), while physical and chemical
   ignition delays are measured using a modified Cetane Rating (CID 510)
   instrument under a wide range of air temperatures and oxygen dilution
   levels.
   The measured derived cetane number (DCN) for UM I shows a reasonably
   good match with the practical Jet-A fuel (POSF 4658), while gas-phase
   oxidation behavior is less, well-matched in the modified CFR engine. In
   contrast, although the measured DCN of UM II revealed a lower value than
   the estimated value using a surrogate optimizer, the ignition behavior
   is relatively well match with that of the target Jet-A in the modified
   CFR engine. The similarities in physical and chemical ignition delays as
   compared with the target Jet-A support the effectiveness of the UM II
   surrogate, while in contrast, the UM I surrogate only matched the
   chemical ignition delay. This is attributed to the importance of the
   surrogate component decalin, which improved the physical properties as
   compared to MCH, while the other three components were the same for the
   two surrogates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Linearly-polarized magnetic dipole (MD) scattering as intense as
   Rayleigh scattering is reported in transparent garnet crystals and fused

   Radiation patterns in quartz show the strongest optical magnetization
   relative to electric polarization ever reported. As shown in an
   accompanying paper, quantitative agreement is achieved with a
   strong-field, fully-quantized theory of magneto-electric (M-E)
   interactions in molecular media. The conclusion is reached that magnetic
   torque enables 2-photon resonance in an EH{*} process that excites
   molecular librations and accounts for the observed upper limit on
   magnetization. Second-order M-E dynamics can also account for
   unpolarized scattering from high-frequency librations previously
   ascribed to first-order collision-induced or third-order, all-electric

Abstract = {{A fully quantized analysis is presented on the origin of induced
   magnetic dipole (MD) scattering in two-level diatomic molecules. The
   interaction is driven by dual optical fields, E and H{*}, and is
   universally allowed in dielectric optical materials, including
   centrosymmetric media. Leading terms of the interaction are shown to be
   quadratic and cubic with respect to the intensity, predicting an upper
   limit for the induced magnetic dipole scattering intensity (I-MD
   proportional to m(2)) that is equal to the electric dipole scattering
   (I-ED proportional to p(2)). The optical dynamics proceed by first
   establishing an electric polarization in the system. Then the magnetic
   field exerts torque on the orbital angular momentum of the excited
   state, mediating an exchange of orbital and rotational angular momenta
   that enhances the magnetic moment. The magneto-electric interaction also
   accounts for second-order, unpolarized scattering from high-frequency
   librations previously ascribed to third-order, all-electric processes.

Abstract = {{We report the use of planar ring-shaped phononic crystals (PnCs) as
   anchor boundaries of very-high-frequency band piezoelectric-on-silicon
   Lamb mode resonators for the purpose of enhancing their quality factor
   (Q). Here, we exploit the acoustic bandgap associated with the PnC
   anchoring boundaries to reduce acoustic energy leakage out of the
   micromechanical resonator. The proposed approach provides greater
   mechanical robustness (by merit of interlocking the cells in a matrix)
   and the possibility of electrical routing through the PnC cells. We
   experimentally show enhancements in Q by a factor of three using the
   proposed approach of hybridizing planar ring-shaped PnCs with
   micromechanical resonators. The effect of these PnCs on resonator Q is
   further corroborated by their effects in suppressing transmission when
   incorporated into a delay line. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{We report AlGaN nanowire light emitting diodes (LEDs) operating in the
   ultraviolet-C band. The LED structures are grown by molecular beam
   epitaxy on Si substrate. It is found that with the use of the
   n(+)-GaN/Al/p(+)-AlGaN tunnel junction (TJ), the device resistance is
   reduced by one order of magnitude, and the light output power is
   increased by two orders of magnitude, compared to AlGaN nanowire LEDs
   without TJ. For unpackaged TJ ultraviolet LEDs emitting at 242 nm, a
   maximum output power of 0.37 mW is measured, with a peak external
   quantum efficiency up to 0.012\%. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The coupling of charge carrier motion and pseudospin via chirality for
   massless Dirac fermions in monolayer graphene has generated dramatic
   consequences, such as the unusual quantum Hall effect and Klein
   tunneling. In bilayer graphene, charge carriers are massive Dirac
   fermions with a finite density of states at zero energy. Because of
   their non-relativistic nature, massive Dirac fermions can provide an
   even better test bed with which to clarify the importance of chirality
   in transport measurement than massless Dirac fermions in monolayer
   graphene. Here, we report an electronic cloaking effect as a
   manifestation of chirality by probing phase coherent transport in
   chemical-vapor-deposited bilayer graphene. Conductance oscillations with
   different periodicities were observed on extremely narrow bilayer
   graphene heterojunctions through electrostatic gating. Using a Fourier
   analysis technique, we identified the origin of each individual
   interference pattern. Importantly, the electron waves on the two sides
   of the potential barrier can be coupled through the evanescent waves
   inside the barrier, making the confined states underneath the barrier
   invisible to electrons. These findings provide direct evidence for the
   electronic cloaking effect and hold promise for the realization of
   pseudospintronics based on bilayer graphene.}},

Title = {{Controlling Rayleigh-Taylor Instabilities in Magnetically Driven Solid
   Metal Shells by Means of a Dynamic Screw Pinch}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Magnetically driven implosions of solid metal shells are an effective
   vehicle to compress materials to extreme pressures and densities.
   Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (RTI) are ubiquitous, yet typically
   undesired features in all such experiments where solid materials are
   rapidly accelerated to high velocities. In cylindrical shells
   ({''}liners{''}), the magnetic field driving the implosion can
   exacerbate the RTI. We suggest an approach to implode solid metal liners
   enabling a remarkable reduction in the growth of magnetized RTI (MRTI)
   by employing a magnetic drive with a tilted, dynamic polarization,
   forming a dynamic screw pinch. Our calculations, based on a
   self-consistent analytic framework, demonstrate that the cumulative
   growth of the most deleterious MRTI modes may be reduced by as much as 1
   to 2 orders of magnitude. One key application of this technique is to
   generate increasingly stable, higher-performance implosions of solid
   metal liners to achieve fusion {[}M.R. Gomez et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
   113, 155003 (2014)]. We weigh the potentially dramatic benefits of the
   solid liner dynamic screw pinch against the experimental tradeoffs
   required to achieve the desired drive field history and identify
   promising designs for future experimental and computational studies.}},

Abstract = {{For certain classes of relativistic plasma problems, performing
   numerical calculations in a Lorentz boosted frame can be even more
   advantageous for gridded momentum-space-time (e.g., Vlasov) problems
   than has been demonstrated for position space-time problems and result
   in a potential reduction in the number of calculations needed by a
   factor similar to gamma(6)(b). In this study, the Lorentz boosted frame
   technique was applied to the problem of warm wave-breaking limits of
   plasma waves with relativistic phase velocity. The numerical results are
   consistent with analytic conclusions. By appropriate normalization and
   for sufficiently warm plasma, the dynamics for the Vlasov equation in
   different Lorentz frames were found to be independent of gamma(p).}},

Abstract = {{Mg/O-2 cells employing a MgCl2/AlCl3/DME (MACC/DME) electrolyte are
   cycled and compared to cells with modified Grignard electrolytes,
   showing that performance of magnesium/oxygen batteries depends strongly
   on electrolyte composition. Discharge capacity is far greater for
   MACC/DME-based cells, while rechargeability in these systems is severely
   limited. The Mg/O-2-MACC/DME discharge product comprises a mixture of
   Mg(ClO4)(2) and MgCl2, with the latter likely formed from slow
   decomposition of the former. The presence of Cl in these compounds
   suggests that the electrolyte participates in the cell reaction or
   reacts readily with the initial electrochemical products. A rate study
   suggests that O-2 diffusion in the electrolyte limits discharge
   capacities at higher currents. Formation of an insulating product film
   on the positive electrodes of Mg/O-2-MACC/DME cells following deep
   discharge increases cell impedance substantially and likely explains the
   poor rechargeability. An additional impedance rise consistent with film
   formation on the Mg negative electrode suggests the presence of
   detrimental O-2 crossover. Minimizing O-2 crossover and bypassing charge
   transfer through the discharge product would improve battery
   performance.}},

Title = {{Associative and Entanglement Contributions to the Solution Rheology of a

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{8313-8321}},

Abstract = {{We report the viscosity of semidilute solutions of a bacterially
   synthesized polysaccharide a partially deacetylated
   poly-N-acetylglucosamine as measured by micro-rheology. This polymer,
   commonly called polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), is
   synthesized by Staphylococcal strains; it is a principal component of
   the biofilms of these bacteria. We show that the concentration-dependent
   viscosity of PIA at a pH in which it is associated can be predicted
   using the Heo-Larson equation for entangled polymers {[}J. Rheol. 2005,
   49 (5), 1117-1128], if the molecular parameters of the equation are
   measured in its associated state. This agreement is consistent with PIA
   adopting a concentration-dependent scaling of the viscosity that is
   dominated by entanglements and intermolecular associations, as described
   in the theory of Rubinstein and Semenov {[}Macromolecules 2001, 34 (4),
   1058-1068]. The zero-shear specific viscosity, eta(sp), measured in the
   concentration range, c(PIA) = 0.1-13 wt \%, scales as eta(sp) similar to
   c(PIA)(1.27 +/- 0.15) up to an entanglement concentration, c(e) = 3.2
   wt,. \%, after which lisp eta(sp) similar to c(PIA)(4.25 +/- 0.30) In
   the presence of urea, a known disruptor of associations, these scaling
   shifts to eta(sp) similar to c(PIA)(1.02 +/- 0.2) and eta(sp) similar to
   c(PIA)(2.57 +/- 0.6), respectively; no shift in c(e) is observed. The
   urea effect is consistent with an associative contribution to viscosity
   in the aqueous solution case. The invariance of c(e) suggests that the
   rheology of this polymer solvent system also includes an entanglement
   contribution. With independent estimates of the PIA weight-average molar
   mass, M-w, entanglement molecular weight, M-e, hydrodynamic radius, R-H,
   and excluded volume, nu, we use the Heo-Larson equation to predict
   eta(sp) as a function of c(PIA). With the use of parameters from the
   associated state particularly the hydrodynamic radius we find good
   agreement between the model and data for aqueous PIA solutions. This
   study offers a means to predict the rheology of associating
   polysaccharides using correlations for nonassociating polymers adjusted
   with minimal a priori data from their associated state.}},

   demonstrated that low doses of IR intrinsically activated NF kappa B in
   resistant MEC cell lines. Moreover, resistance was significantly
   enhanced in IR-sensitive cell lines when NF kappa B pathway was
   stimulated. Pharmacological inhibition of the IKK-beta/I kappa B
   alpha/NF kappa B axis, using a single dose of FDA-approved Emetine, led
   to a striking sensitization of MEC cells to IR and a reduction in cancer
   stem cells. We achieved a major step towards better understanding the
   basic mechanisms involved in IR-adaptive resistance in MEC cell lines

Abstract = {{Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) are
   miscible with each other, and their glass transition temperatures differ
   a lot. With this feature, we tried to design a triple-shape memory
   material by simply blending them together. After carefully examining the
   glass transition broadness and the tensile behavior of various PCL/PVC
   blends, PCL-30\% (the weight fraction of PCL was 30\%) was picked out as
   the best candidate. It fulfills two criterions that it has a wide glass
   transition range and it has no strain or stress induced crystallization.
   Subsequent triple-shape memory procedure proves that it could function
   as an effective shape memory blend. The structure was studied by
   SAXS/WAXS and nano-scale periodic structure was found, which was
   composed of crystalline and amorphous PCL regions of 4.7 nm and 8.4 nm
   respectively. Such periodic domains would orient along the stretch
   direction, but it kept stable and could restore to its original state
   after the stress was released. Dichromic FTIR discerned the orientation
   of PCL chains at low temperature and PVC chains at high temperature. It
   can be concluded that both the nano-scale PCL crystalline structures and
   physical entanglements served as the fixed phase, while the amorphous
   PVC and PCL regions played as the reversible phase at high and low
   switch temperatures respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Syngas, the mixture of CO and H-2, is a key feedstock to produce
   methanol and liquid fuels in industry, yet limited success has been made
   to develop clean syngas production using renewable solar energy. We
   demonstrated that syngas with a benchmark turnover number of 1330 and a
   desirable CO/H-2 ratio of 1: 2 could be attained from
   photoelectrochemical CO2 and H2O reduction in an aqueous medium by
   exploiting the synergistic co-catalytic effect between Cu and ZnO. The
   CO/H-2 ratio in the syngas products was tuned in a large range between
   2: 1 and 1: 4 with a total unity Faradaic efficiency. Moreover, a high
   Faradaic efficiency of 70\% for CO was acheived at underpotential of 180
   mV, which is the lowest potential ever reported in an aqueous
   photoelectrochemical cell. It was found that the combination of Cu and
   ZnO offered complementary chemical properties that lead to special
   reaction channels not seen in Cu, or ZnO alone.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{80-91}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)
   discretization for unsteady simulations of convection-dominated flows on
   mapped deforming domains. Mesh deformation is achieved through an
   arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian transformation with an analytical mapping.
   We present details of this transformation applied to the HDG system of
   equations, with focus on the auxiliary gradient equation, viscous
   stabilization, and output calculation. We discuss conditions under which
   optimal unsteady output convergence rates can be attained, and we show
   that both HDG and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) achieve these rates in
   advection-dominated flows. Results for scalar advection-diffusion and
   the Euler equations verify the implementation of the mesh motion mapping
   for both discretizations, show that HDG and DG yield similar results on
   a given mesh, and demonstrate differences in output convergence rates
   depending on the choice of HDG viscous stabilization. We note that such
   similar results bode well for HDG, which has fewer globally-coupled
   degrees of freedom compared to DG. A simulation of the unsteady
   compressible Navier-Stokes equations demonstrates again very similar
   results for HDG and DG and illustrates a pitfall of using steady-state
   adapted meshes for accurate unsteady simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This work presents an optospectroscopic characterization technique for
   soft tissue microstructure using site-matched confocal Raman
   microspectroscopy and polarized light microscopy. Using the technique,
   the microstructure of soft tissue samples is directly observed by
   polarized light microscopy during loading while spatially correlated
   spectroscopic information is extracted from the same plane, verifying
   the orientation and arrangement of the collagen fibers. Results show the
   response and orientation of the collagen fiber arrangement in its native
   state as well as during tensile and compressive loadings in a porcine
   sclera model. An example is also given showing how the data can be used
   with a finite element program to estimate the strain in individual
   collagen fibers. The measurements demonstrate features that indicate
   microstructural reorganization and damage of the sclera's collagen fiber
   arrangement under loading. The site-matched confocal Raman
   microspectroscopic characterization of the tissue provides a qualitative
   measure to relate the change in fibrillar arrangement with possible
   chemical damage to the collagen microstructure. Tests and analyses
   presented here can potentially be used to determine the stress-strain
   behavior, and fiber reorganization of the collagen microstructure in

Abstract = {{Infrared observations of the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko were
   carried out from 2015 July to September, i.e. around perihelion (2015
   August 13), with the high-resolution channel of the Visible and Infrared
   Thermal Imaging Spectrometer instrument onboard Rosetta. We present the
   analysis of fluorescence emission lines of H2O, CO2, (CO2)-C-13, OCS,
   and CH4 detected in limb sounding with the field of view at 2.7-5 km
   from the comet centre. Measurements are sampling outgassing from the
   illuminated Southern hemisphere, as revealed by H2O and CO2 raster maps,
   which show anisotropic distributions, aligned along the projected
   rotation axis. An abrupt increase of water production is observed 6 d
   after perihelion. In the meantime, CO2, CH4, and OCS abundances relative
   to water increased by a factor of 2 to reach mean values of 32, 0.47,
   and 0.18 per cent, respectively, averaging post-perihelion data. We
   interpret these changes as resulting from the erosion of volatile-poor
   surface layers. Sustained dust ablation due to the sublimation of water
   ice maintained volatile-rich layers near the surface until at least the
   end of the considered period, as expected for low thermal inertia
   surface layers. The large abundance measured for CO2 should be
   representative of the 67P nucleus original composition, and indicates
   that 67P is a CO2-rich comet. Comparison with abundance ratios measured
   in the Northern hemisphere shows that seasons play an important role in
   comet outgassing. The low CO2/H2O values measured above the illuminated
   Northern hemisphere are not original, but the result of the
   devolatilization of the uppermost layers.}},

Abstract = {{Several sulphur-bearing species have already been observed in different
   families of comets. However, the knowledge on the minor sulphur species
   is still limited. The comet's sulphur inventory is closely linked to the
   pre-solar cloud and holds important clues to the degree of reprocessing
   of the material in the solar nebula and during comet accretion. Sulphur
   in pre-solar clouds is highly depleted, which is quite puzzling as the
   S/O ratio in the diffuse interstellar medium is cosmic. This work
   focuses on the abundance of the previously known species H2S, OCS, SO,
   S-2, SO2 and CS2 in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko measured
   by Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis/Double
   Focusing Mass Spectrometer between equinox and perihelion 2015.
   Furthermore, we present the first detection of S-3, S-4, CH3SH and C2H6S
   in a comet, and we determine the elemental abundance of S/O in the bulk
   ice of (1.47 +/- 0.05) x 10(-2). We show that SO is present in the coma
   originating from the nucleus, but not CS in the case of 67P, and for the
   first time establish that S-2 is present in a volatile and a refractory
   phase. The derived total elemental sulphur abundance of 67P is in
   agreement with solar photospheric elemental abundances and shows no
   sulphur depletion as reported for dense interstellar clouds. Also the
   presence of S-2 at heliocentric distances larger than 3 au indicates
   that sulphur-bearing species have been processed by radiolysis in the
   pre-solar cloud and that at least some of the ice from this cloud has
   survived in comets up the present.}},

Abstract = {{We analyse the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis
   (ROSINA) - the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer data between 2014
   August and 2016 February to examine the effect of seasonal variations on
   the four major species within the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
   (H2O, CO2, CO, and O-2), resulting from the tilt in the orientation of
   the comet's spin axis. Using a numerical data inversion, we derive the
   non-uniform activity distribution at the surface of the nucleus for
   these species, suggesting that the activity distribution at the surface
   of the nucleus has not significantly been changed and that the
   differences observed in the coma are solely due to the variations in
   illumination conditions. A three-dimensional Direct Simulation Monte
   Carlo model is applied where the boundary conditions are computed with a
   coupling of the surface activity distributions and the local
   illumination. The model is able to reproduce the evolution of the
   densities observed by ROSINA including the changes happening at equinox.
   While O-2 stays correlated with H2O as it was before equinox, CO2 and
   CO, which had a poor correlation with respect to H2O pre-equinox, also
   became well correlated with H2O post-equinox. The integration of the
   densities from the model along the line of sight results in column
   densities directly comparable to the VIRTIS-H observations. Also, the
   evolution of the volatiles' production rates is derived from the coma
   model showing a steepening in the production rate curves after equinox.
   The model/data comparison suggests that the seasonal effects result in
   the Northern hemisphere of 67P's nucleus being more processed with a
   layered structure while the Southern hemisphere constantly exposes new
   material.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the evolution of the water production of comet
   67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the Rosetta mission (2014 June-2016
   May) based on in situ and remote sensing measurements made by Rosetta
   instruments, Earth-based telescopes and through the development of an
   empirical coma model. The derivation of the empirical model is described
   and the model is then applied to detrend spacecraft position effects
   from the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis
   (ROSINA) data. The inter-comparison of the instrument data sets shows a
   high level of consistency and provides insights into the water and dust
   production. We examine different phases of the orbit, including the
   early mission (beyond 3.5 au) where the ROSINA water production does not
   show the expected increase with decreasing heliocentric distance. A
   second important phase is the period around the inbound equinox, where
   the peak water production makes a dramatic transition from northern to
   southern latitudes. During this transition, the water distribution is
   complex, but is driven by rotation and active areas in the north and
   south. Finally, we consider the perihelion period, where there may be
   evidence of time dependence in the water production rate. The peak water
   production, as measured by ROSINA, occurs 18-22 d after perihelion at
   3.5 +/- 0.5 x 10(28) water molecules s(-1). We show that the water
   production is highly correlated with ground-based dust measurements,
   possibly indicating that several dust parameters are constant during the
   observed period. Using estimates of the dust/gas ratio, we use our
   measured water production rate to calculate a uniform surface loss of
   2-4 m during the current perihelion passage.}},

Abstract = {{The Rosetta Plasma Consortium MAGnetometer (RPC-MAG) has detected
   signatures of diamagnetic regions associated with comet
   67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko at distances from 30 to 400 km at different
   heliocentric distances, which is larger than what has been predicted by
   numerical simulations of the cometary plasam environment. The physical
   mechanism behind these diamagnetic regions is still unknown. In this
   work, we use our newly developed multifluid plasma-neutral model to
   explore a possible physical mechanism that might create such regions.
   The model solves the governing multifluid magnetohydrodynamic equations
   for cometary and solar wind ions and electrons, and the Euler equations
   for the neutral gas fluid. We find that a local increase of electron
   thermal pressure is capable of generating many of the observed features
   of the diamagnetic regions observed by RPC-MAG. The simulation results
   show that a magnetic field-free region is formed and the recovery phase
   of the magnetic field magnitude is faster than the declining phase.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation is presented of the dust scattering in the coma of
   67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for the dates of 2015 February 28, March 15
   and April 27. A comparison of the morphology of dust continuum maps at
   1.1 mu m and gas emission shows that for the above dates the spatial
   distribution of the dust is strongly correlated with H2O but not with
   CO2 emission. For April 27, the radial profile on the illuminated side
   of the nucleus in the inner coma agrees well with the direct simulation
   Monte Carlo (DSMC) calculations as the dust is accelerating and flows
   outwards distribution of the dust is narrower than the broader emission
   of the gas. Af. values are 1.13 m for 2015 February 28, 2.02 m for April
   27, while local values for March 15 are 2.3-5.3 m, depending on the
   nucleus illumination. In the inner coma, the spectral reflectivity from
   0.35 to 3.5 mu m displays a red slope with a change at around 1 mu m.
   From 0.35 to 0.8 mu m, the values range from 9 to 12 +/- 1 per cent per
   100 nm both on the sunlit side and on the dark side. From 1 to 2.5 mu m,
   the values are 1.7 +/- 0.2 per cent per 100 nm on the sunlit side and 3
   +/- 1 per cent per 100 nm on the dark side. For the August 26 jet, no
   significant increase of the colour gradient with distance from the
   nucleus could be observed, nor any significant difference detected
   between the jet and the background coma.}},

Abstract = {{This work is a part of a more global effort aimed at understanding and
   interpreting in situ and remote sensing data acquired by instruments on
   board Rosetta. This study aims at deriving the dust mass source rate and
   the location of the dust jet source observed by Rosetta VIRTIS-M on 2015
   April 12. The analysis is performed by means of the coupled kinetic
   modelling of gas and dust in the coma of comet
   67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which were used for calculating the coma
   brightness as it would be seen from the Rosetta spacecraft. The dust
   mass production rate and a possible location of the jet origin needed to
   explain the Rosetta VIRTIS-M dust brightness image were inferred by
   comparing the calculated brightness with VIRTIS-M data. Our analysis
   suggests that the dust mass production rate needed to maintain the
   observed jet is about 1.9 kg s(-1). According to our analysis, the
   location of the observed jet surface footprint is outside of the nucleus
   area characterized by the highest gas production rate, which suggests
   that gas and dust source rates are not necessarily proportional to each
   other across the entire nucleus surface. The inferred location of the
   possible jet origin is consistent with that of the observed active pits.
   In this paper, we show that the jet intensity is variable in time, and
   has a lifetime of at least 10 h.}},

   Forecasting Flutter Using Gust Responses}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Forecasting bifurcations is a significant challenge and an important
   need in several applications. Most of the existing forecasting
   approaches focus on bifurcations in nonoscillating systems. However,
   subcritical and supercritical flutter (Hopf) bifurcations are very
   common in a variety of systems, especially fluid-structural systems.
   This paper presents a unique approach to forecast (nonlinear) flutter
   based on observations of the system only in the prebifurcation regime.
   The proposed method is based on exploiting the phenomenon of critical
   slowing down (CSD) in oscillating systems near certain bifurcations.
   Techniques are introduced to enhance the prediction accuracy for cases
   of low-frequency oscillations and large-dimensional dynamical systems.
   The method is applied to an aeroelastic system responding to gust loads.
   Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the
   method in predicting the postbifurcation regime accurately in both
   supercritical and subcritical cases.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we establish a mathematical framework that allows us to
   optimize the speed profile and select the optimal gears for heavy-duty

   idea is to solve the analogous boundary value problem (BVP) analytically
   for a simple scenario (linear damped system with quadratic elevation
   profile) and use this result to initialize a numerical continuation
   algorithm. Then, the numerical algorithm is used to investigate how the
   optimal solution changes with parameters. In particular, we gradually
   introduce nonlinearities (air resistance and engine saturation),
   implement different elevation profiles, and incorporate external
   perturbations (headwind and traffic). This approach enables real-time
   optimization in dynamic traffic conditions, therefore may be implemented
   on-board.}},

Abstract = {{Jellyfish have become a topic of interest of many marine scientists and
   managers alike due to their conspicuous socio-economic and environmental
   impacts. However, our knowledge about their ``everyday life{''} remains
   limited. While electronic tags (transmitters and loggers) have been
   extensively used to study marine vertebrates for the past 50 years,
   tagging is still in its infancy for marine invertebrates and jellyfish
   in particular. Progress has been hampered by the difficulty and limited
   knowledge of attaching tags to soft-bodied animals. We argue that there
   is huge potential to use tagging to gather basic information on the
   ecology and behaviour of these species. Here, we give an overview of
   what has been learned so far by deploying tags on jellyfish, and why
   tagging is an appropriate method to study their behaviour and ecology.
   We then describe different tagging techniques, their advantages,
   disadvantages and challenges, and the steps to ensure future successful
   jellyfish tagging studies.}},

Abstract = {{We study a worst-case approach to measure the sensitivity to model
   misspecification in the performance analysis of stochastic systems. The
   situation of interest is when only minimal parametric information is
   available on the form of the true model. Under this setting, we post
   optimization programs that compute the worst-case performance measures,
   subject to constraints on the amount of model misspecification measured
   by Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our main contribution is the development
   of infinitesimal approximations for these programs, resulting in
   asymptotic expansions of their optimal values as the divergence shrinks
   to zero. The coefficients of these expansions can be computed via
   simulation, and are mathematically derived from the representation of
   the worst-case models as changes of measure that satisfy a well-defined
   class of functional fixed-point equations.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced oxidation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in
   wastewater produces transformation products (TPs) that are often more
   biodegradable than the parent compounds. Secondary effluent from a
   wastewater treatment plant was treated using UV-based advanced oxidation
   (LPUV/H2O2 and MPUV/NO3) followed by biological aerated filtration
   (BAF), and different APIs and their transformation products were
   monitored. The advanced oxidation processes degraded the APIs by 55-87\%
   (LPUV/H2O2) and 58-95\% (MPUV/NO3), while minor loss of APIs was
   achieved in the downstream BAF system. Eleven TPs were detected
   following oxidation of carbamazepine (5) and iopromide (6); three key
   TPs were biodegraded in the BAF system. The other TPs remained
   relatively constant in the BAF. The decrease in UV absorbance (UVA(254))
   of the effluent in the BAF system was linearly correlated to the
   degradation of the APIs (for the MPUV/NO3-BAF), and can be applied to
   monitor the biotransformation of APIs in biological-based systems.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{8986-9000}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An approach to adaptively measure runoff water quality dynamics is
   introduced, focusing specifically on characterizing the timing and
   magnitude of urban pollutographs. Rather than relying on a static
   schedule or flow-weighted sampling, which can miss important water
   quality dynamics if parameterized inadequately, novel Internet-enabled
   sensor nodes are used to autonomously adapt their measurement frequency
   to real-time weather forecasts and hydrologic conditions. This dynamic
   approach has the potential to significantly improve the use of
   constrained experimental resources, such as automated grab samplers,
   which continue to provide a strong alternative to sampling water quality
   dynamics when in situ sensors are not available. Compared to
   conventional flow-weighted or time-weighted sampling schemes, which rely
   on preset thresholds, a major benefit of the approach is the ability to
   dynamically adapt to features of an underlying hydrologic signal. A 28
   km(2) urban watershed was studied to characterize concentrations of
   total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus. Water quality samples
   were autonomously triggered in response to features in the underlying
   hydrograph and real-time weather forecasts. The study watershed did not
   exhibit a strong first flush and intraevent concentration variability
   was driven by flow acceleration, wherein the largest loadings of TSS and
   total phosphorus corresponded with the steepest rising limbs of the
   storm hydrograph. The scalability of the proposed method is discussed in
   the context of larger sensor network deployments, as well the potential
   to improving control of urban water quality.}},

Abstract = {{Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) is an active,
   bistatic remote sensing technique operating at L-band frequencies.
   GNSS-R signals scattered from a rough ocean surface are known to
   interact with longer surface waves than traditional scatterometery and
   altimetry signals. A revised forward model for GNSS-R measurements is
   presented which assumes an ocean surface wave spectrum that is forced by
   other sources than just the local near-surface winds. The model is
   motivated by recent spaceborne GNSS-R observations that indicate a
   strong scattering dependence on significant wave height, even after
   controlling for local wind speed. This behavior is not well represented
   by the most commonly used GNSS-R scattering model, which features a
   one-to-one relationship between wind speed and the mean-square-slope of
   the ocean surface. The revised forward model incorporates a third
   generation wave model that is skillful at representing long waves, an
   anchored spectral tail model, and a GNSS-R electromagnetic scattering
   model. In comparisons with the spaceborne measurements, the new model is
   much better able to reproduce the empirical behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Adults perform better than juveniles in food-seeking tasks. Using the
   nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to probe the neural mechanisms
   underlying behavioral maturation, we found that adults and juveniles
   require different combinations of sensory neurons to generate
   age-specific food-seeking behavior. We first show that adults and
   juveniles differ in their response to and preference for food-associated
   odors, and we analyze genetic mutants to map the neuronal circuits
   required for those behavioral responses. We developed a novel device to
   trap juveniles and record their neuronal activity. Activity measurements
   revealed that adult and juvenile AWA sensory neurons respond to the
   addition of diacetyl stimulus, whereas AWB, ASK, and AWC sensory neurons
   encode its removal specifically in adults. Further, we show that
   reducing neurotransmission from the additional AWB, ASK, and AWC sensory
   neurons transforms odor preferences from an adult to a juvenile-like
   state. We also show that AWB and ASK neurons drive behavioral changes
   exclusively in adults, providing more evidence that age-specific
   circuits drive age-specific behavior. Collectively, our results show
   that an odor-evoked sensory code is modified during the
   juvenile-to-adult transition in animal development to drive
   age-appropriate behavior. We suggest that this altered sensory code
   specifically enables adults to extract additional stimulus features and
   generate robust behavior.}},

Abstract = {{As compared to short-term forecasting (e.g., 1 day), it is often
   challenging to accurately forecast the volume of precipitation in a
   medium-term horizon (e.g., 1 week). As a result, fluctuations in water
   inflow can trigger generation shortage and electricity price spikes in a
   power system with major or predominant hydro resources. In this paper,
   we study a two-stage robust scheduling approach for a hydrothermal power
   system. We consider water inflow uncertainty and employ a vector
   autoregressive (VAR) model to represent its seasonality and accordingly
   construct an uncertainty set in the robust optimization approach. We
   design a Benders' decomposition algorithm to solve this problem. Results
   are presented for the proposed approach on a real-world case study.}},

Abstract = {{States of the electromagnetic field confined near a periodically
   corrugated surface of a perfect conductor, spoof surface plasmon
   polaritons (SSPP), are approached systematically based on the developed
   adaptation of the mode matching technique to the transfer matrix
   formalism. Within this approach, in the approximation of narrow grooves,
   systems with arbitrary transversal structure can be investigated
   straightforwardly, thus lifting the restrictions of the effective medium
   description and usual implementations of mode matching. A compact
   expression for the SSPP coupling parameter accounting for the effect of
   higher Bloch modes is found. The results of the general analysis are
   applied for studying the effect of dielectric environment on SSPP
   spectra. It is shown that the effective SSPP plasma frequency is
   unaffected by the dielectric constant of the medium outside of the
   grooves and the main effect of sufficiently wide dielectric slabs
   covering the corrugated surface is described by simple rescaling of the
   maximal value of the Bloch wavenumber and the coupling parameter.
   Additionally, in the case of a thin dielectric layer, it is shown that
   SSPP are sensitive to variation of the thickness of the layer on the
   sub-wavelength scale.}},

Title = {{Self-locking degree-4 vertex origami structures}},

Abstract = {{A generic degree-4 vertex (4-vertex) origami possesses one continuous
   degree-of-freedom for rigid folding, and this folding process can be
   stopped when two of its facets bind together. Such facet-binding will
   induce self-locking so that the overall structure stays at a
   pre-specified configuration without additional locking elements or
   actuators. Self-locking offers many promising properties, such as
   programmable deformation ranges and piecewise stiffness jumps, that
   could significantly advance many adaptive structural systems. However,
   despite its excellent potential, the origami self-locking features have
   not been well studied, understood, and used. To advance the state of the
   art, this research conducts a comprehensive investigation on the
   principles of achieving and harnessing self-locking in 4-vertex origami
   structures. Especially, for the first time, this study expands the
   4-vertex structure construction from single-component to dual-component
   designs and investigates their self-locking behaviours. By exploiting
   various tessellation designs, this research discovers that the
   dual-component designs offer the origami structures with extraordinary
   attributes that the single-component structures do not have, which
   include the existence of flat-folded locking planes, programmable
   locking points and deformability. Finally, proof-of-concept experiments
   investigate how self-locking can effectively induce piecewise stiffness
   jumps. The results of this research provide new scientific knowledge and
   a systematic framework for the design, analysis and utilization of
   self-locking origami structures for many potential engineering
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Strongly conducting or magnetized obstacles in a flowing plasma generate
   structures called Alfven wings, which mediate momentum transfer between
   the obstacle and the plasma. Nonconducting obstacles such as airless
   planetary bodies can generate such structures, which, however, have so
   far been seen only in sub-Alfvenic regime. A novel statistical analysis
   of simultaneous measurements made by two ARTEMIS satellites, one in the
   solar wind upstream of the Moon and one in the downstream wake, and
   comparison of the data with results of a three-dimensional hybrid model
   of the interaction reveal that the perturbed plasma downstream of the
   Moon generates Alfven wings in super-Alfvenic solar wind. In the wake
   region, magnetic field lines bulge toward the Moon and the plasma flows
   are significantly perturbed. We use the simulation to show that some of
   the observed bends of the field result from field-aligned currents. The
   perturbations in the wake thus arise from a combination of compressional
   and Alfvenic perturbations. Because of the super-Alfvenic background
   flow of the solar wind, the two Alfven wings fold back to form a small
   intersection angle. The currents that form the Alfven wing in the wake
   are driven by both plasma flow deceleration and a gradient of plasma
   pressure, positive down the wake from the region just downstream of the
   Moon. Such Alfven wing structures, caused by pressure gradients in the
   wake and the resulting plasma slowdown, should exist downstream of any
   nonconducting body in a super-Alfvenic plasma flow.}},

Abstract = {{The main phase of the 17 March 2013 storm had excellent coverage from
   ground-based instruments and from low-and high-altitude spacecraft,
   allowing for evaluation of the relations between major storm time
   phenomena that are often considered separately. The shock impact with
   its concurrent southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) immediately
   drove dramatic poleward expansion of the poleward boundary of the
   auroral oval (implying strong nightside reconnection), strong auroral
   activity, and strong penetrating midlatitude convection and ionospheric
   currents. This was followed by periods of southward IMF driving of
   electric fields that were at first relatively smooth as often employed
   in storm modeling but then became extremely bursty and structured
   associated with equatorward extending auroral streamers. The auroral
   oval did not expand much further poleward during these two latter
   periods, suggesting a lower overall nightside reconnection rate than
   that during the first period and approximate balance with dayside
   reconnection. Characteristics of these three modes of driving were
   reflected in horizontal and field-aligned currents. Equatorward
   expansion of the auroral oval occurred predominantly during the
   structured convection mode, when electric fields became extremely
   bursty. The period of this third mode also approximately corresponded to
   the time of largest equatorward motion of the ionospheric trough, of
   apparent transport of high total electron content (TEC) features into
   the auroral oval from the polar cap, and of largest earthward injection
   of ions and electrons into the ring current. The enhanced responses of
   the aurora, currents, TEC, and the ring current indicate a common
   driving of all these storm time features during the bursty convection
   mode period.}},

Abstract = {{Foams are a common material for high-energy-density physics experiments
   because of low, tunable densities, and being machinable. Simulating
   these experiments can be difficult because the equation of state is
   largely unknown for shocked foams. The focus of this experiment was to
   develop an x-ray scattering platform for measuring the equation of state
   of shocked foams on OMEGA EP. The foam used in this experiment is
   resorcinol formaldehyde with an initial density of 0.34 g/cm3. One

Abstract = {{An optical microscope is described that reveals contrast in the Mueller
   matrix images of a thin, transparent, or semi-transparent specimen
   located within an anisotropic object plane (anisotropic filter). The
   specimen changes the anisotropy of the filter and thereby produces
   contrast within the Mueller matrix images. Here we use an anisotropic
   filter composed of a semi-transparent, nanostructured thin film with
   sub-wavelength thickness placed within the object plane. The sample is
   illuminated as in common optical microscopy but the light is modulated
   in its polarization using combinations of linear polarizers and phase
   plate (compensator) to control and analyze the state of polarization.
   Direct generalized ellipsometry data analysis approaches permit
   extraction of fundamental Mueller matrix object plane images dispensing
   with the need of Fourier expansion methods. Generalized ellipsometry
   model approaches are used for quantitative image analyses. These images
   are obtained from sets of multiple images obtained under various
   polarizer, analyzer, and compensator settings. Up to 16 independent
   Mueller matrix images can be obtained, while our current setup is
   limited to 11 images normalized by the unpolarized intensity. We
   demonstrate the anisotropic contrast optical microscope by measuring
   lithographically defined micro-patterned anisotropic filters, and we
   quantify the adsorption of an organic self-assembled monolayer film onto
   the anisotropic filter. Comparison with an isotropic glass slide
   demonstrates the image enhancement obtained by our method over
   microscopy without the use of an anisotropic filter. In our current
   instrument, we estimate the limit of detection for organic volumetric
   mass within the object plane of approximate to 49 fg within approximate
   to 7 x 7 mu m(2) object surface area. Compared to a quartz crystal
   microbalance with dissipation instrumentation, where contemporary limits
   require a total load of approximate to 500 pg for detection, the
   instrumentation demonstrated here improves sensitivity to a total mass
   required for detection by 4 orders of magnitude. We detail the design
   and operation principles of the anisotropic contrast optical microscope,
   and we present further applications to the detection of nanoparticles,
   to novel approaches for imaging chromatography and to new contrast
   modalities for observations on living cells. Published by AIP

Title = {{Dynamic simulations show repeated narrowing maximizes DNA linearization

Abstract = {{This paper uses computer simulations to reveal unprecedented details
   about linearization of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inside dynamic
   nanochannels that can be repeatedly widened and narrowed. We first
   analyze the effect of rate of channel narrowing on DNA linearization
   dynamics. Quick (similar to 0.1 s) narrowing of nanoscale channels
   results in rapid overstretching of the semi-flexible chain followed by a
   slower (similar to 0.1-10 s) relaxation to an equilibrium extension. Two
   phenomena that induce linearization during channel narrowing, namely,
   elongational-flow and confinement, occur simultaneously, regardless of
   narrowing speed. Interestingly, although elongational flow is a minimum
   at the mid-point of the channel and increases towards the two ends,
   neither the linearization dynamics nor the degree of DNA extension
   varies significantly with the center-of-mass of the polymer projected on
   the channel axis. We also noticed that there was a significant
   difference in time to reach the equilibrium length, as well as the
   degree of DNA linearization at short times, depending on the initial
   conformation of the biopolymer. Based on these observations, we tested a
   novel linearization protocol where the channels are narrowed and widened
   repeatedly, allowing DNA to explore multiple conformations. Repeated
   narrowing and widening, something uniquely enabled by the elastomeric
   nanochannels, significantly decrease the time to reach the
   equilibrium-level of stretch when performed within periods comparable to
   the chain relaxation time and more effectively untangle chains into more
   linearized biopolymers. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Quasiperiodic similar to 1 h fluctuations have been recently reported by
   numerous instruments on board the Cassini spacecraft. The interpretation
   of the sources of these fluctuations has remained elusive to date. Here
   we provide an explanation for the origin of these fluctuations using
   magnetometer observations. We find that magnetic field fluctuations at
   high northern latitudes are Alfvenic, with small amplitudes (similar to
   0.4 nT), and are concentrated in wave packets similar to those observed
   in Kleindienst et al. (2009). The wave packets recur periodically at the
   northern magnetic oscillation period. We use a magnetospheric box model
   to provide an interpretation of the wave periods. Our model results
   suggest that the observed magnetic fluctuations are second harmonic
   Alfven waves standing between the northern and southern ionospheres in
   Saturn's outer magnetosphere.}},

Title = {{The Safety Attitudes of Senior Managers in the Chinese Coal Industry}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Senior managers' attitudes towards safety are very
   important regarding the safety practices in an organization. The study
   is to describe the current situation of senior managers' attitudes
   towards safety in the Chinese coal industry. Method: We evaluated the
   changing trends as well as the reasons for these changes in the Chinese
   coal industry in 2009 and in 2014 with 168 senior manager samples from
   large Chinese state-owned coal enterprises. Evaluations of 15 safety
   concepts were performed by means of a questionnaire. Results and
   Conclusions: Results indicate that, in 2014, three concepts were at a
   very high level (mean > 4.5), and six were at a relatively high level
   (4.5 > mean > 4.0). Analyses of changing trends revealed that nine
   concepts improved significantly, while four greatly declined in 2014
   compared to those in 2009. The data reported here suggest that the
   reasons for the significant improvement with respect to the nine
   concepts include the improvement in social and legal environments, the
   improvement of the culture of social safety, workers' safety demands
   being met, and scientific and technical advances in the coal industry.
   The decline of the four concepts seemed to be caused by a poor awareness
   of managers in the coal industry that safety creates economic benefits,
   insufficient information on safety, inadequate attention to the
   development of a safety culture and safety management methods, and
   safety organizations and workers' unions not playing their role
   effectively. Practical Applications: We therefore recommend
   strengthening the evidence that safety creates economic benefits,
   providing incentives for employees to encourage their participation in
   safety management, and paying more attention to the prevention of
   accidents in coal mines via safety organizations and unions. These
   results can provide guidelines for workers, industrialists, and
   government regarding occupational safety in the whole coal industry.}},

Abstract = {{The authors present a nanofabrication technology capable of producing
   arrays of transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures that are

   (TP). Using this NASE+TP method, the authors have demonstrated
   production of WSe2/MoS2 heterostructure arrays with a high uniformity in
   feature thicknesses (relative standard deviation <12\%). The authors
   have also created photodiode devices based on such WSe2/MoS2
   heterostructures, which exhibit significantly enhanced degrees of
   current rectification as well as photovoltaic responses in comparison
   with pure WSe2 devices. Such results indicate that a sizable built-in
   potential is formed at the pristine WSe2/MoS2 interface. This work
   advances the top-down approaches for manufacturing high-quality
   functional heterostructures based on emerging layered semiconductors.

Title = {{Nanofluidic flow assisted assembly of dispersed plasmonic nanostructures

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The authors present a method for assembling plasmonic nanostructures
   into already-sealed shallow nanochannel-based nanofluidic sensor
   structures. This method is termed as nanofluidic-flow-assisted-assembly
   (NFAA). NFAA utilizes nanofluidic flows with large shear rate and stress
   to deposit high-areal-density, well-dispersed plasmonic nanoparticles
   (NPs) into shallow nanochannel sensing areas. In particular, in a NFAA
   process, the nano/microfluidic structures are first patterned into a Si
   or SiO2 substrate and permanently sealed with fused quartz coverslips
   using plasma sealing. Afterward, a colloidal solution of plasmonic NPs
   is driven into the shallow nanochannel structures. In the shallow
   nanochannel areas, the large shear rate and stress of the nanofluidic
   colloidal solution flow results in the deposition of well-dispersed NPs
   and effectively prevents undesirable aggregation of NPs. Using NFAA, the
   authors have demonstrated the deposition of well-dispersed Au NPs with
   various areal densities (10(2)-10(4) mu m(-2)) into shallow
   nanochannels. The light absorbance peak of NFAA-coated Au NPs exhibits
   the narrower full-width-at-half-maximum than that of the Au NPs directly
   deposited from a colloidal solution, further indicating that NFAA can
   result in the higher degree of dispersion of high-density NPs. The
   authors also demonstrated that the additional nanoscale anchoring
   structures prepatterned in a shallow nanochannel, in combination with
   NFAA processes, can enable selective deposition of functional
   nanoparticles around designated locations. This work provides a
   nanofabrication scheme for introducing functional nanostructures into
   already-sealed nanofluidic structures. This method could be further
   generalized to enable integration of various electrically/optically
   active nanoscale components into permanently sealed nano/microfluidic
   structures and therefore address the incompatibility among the
   fabrication routes of these device structures. (C) 2016 American Vacuum

Journal = {{SENSORS}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Tesla turbine and its applications in power generation and fluid flow
   were demonstrated by Nicholas Tesla in 1913. However, its real-world
   implementations were limited by the difficulty to maintain laminar flow
   between rotor disks, transient efficiencies during rotor acceleration,
   and the lack of other applications that fully utilize the continuous
   flow outputs. All of the aforementioned limits of Tesla turbines can be
   addressed by scaling to the microfluidic flow regime. Demonstrated here
   is a microscale Tesla pump designed and fabricated using a Digital Light
   Processing (DLP) based 3D printer with 43 mu m lateral and 30 mu m
   thickness resolutions. The miniaturized pump is characterized by low
   Reynolds number of 1000 and a flow rate of up to 12.6 mL/min at 1200
   rpm, unloaded. It is capable of driving a mixer network to generate
   microfluidic gradient. The continuous, laminar flow from Tesla turbines
   is well-suited to the needs of flow-sensitive microfluidics, where the
   integrated pump will enable numerous compact lab-on-a-chip applications.}},

Abstract = {{Body-worn inertial sensors have enabled motion capture outside of the

   number of times certain motion gestures occur. The application presented
   involves tracking baseball throws and volleyball serves, which are
   common overhead movements that can lead to shoulder and elbow overuse
   injuries. Eleven subjects are recruited to collect training, testing,

Journal = {{AMERICAN MINERALOGIST}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2443-2451}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We have calibrated the infrared (IR) method for determining CO2
   concentrations in apatite with absolute concentrations obtained through
   nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). IR data were obtained on
   double-polished apatite wafers using polarized transmission IR
   spectroscopy. Due to the various sites and orientations of CO32- in
   apatite, the IR spectra are complicated and do not have the same shape
   in different apatite samples. Hence, simple peak heights are not used to
   characterize CO2 concentrations in apatite. The total absorbance
   (A(total)) was derived using the integrated area under the curves in a
   given polarized spectral region. Then A(total) is calculated as A(E//c)
   + 2A(E perpendicular to c). The calibration has been carried out for two
   wavenumber regions, one with high sensitivity and the other applicable
   to apatite with high CO2 concentrations. The first calibration is for
   the fundamental asymmetric CO32- stretching at wavenumbers of 1600-1300
   cm(-1), and the CO2 concentration in parts per million can be obtained
   as (0.0756 +/- 0.0036) A(total)/d where d is sample thickness in
   centimeters. The fundamental stretching bands are strong and hence
   sensitive for measuring low CO2 concentrations in apatite, down to parts
   per million level. The second calibration is for the CO32- bands at
   wavenumbers of 2650-2350 cm(-1), and the CO2 concentration in parts per
   million is (9.3 +/- 0.6) A(total)/d where d is sample thickness in
   centimeters. These bands are weak and hence are useful for measuring
   high CO2 concentrations in apatite without preparation of super-thin
   wafers. The anisotropy is significant. The difference between A(E//c)
   and A(E perpendicular to c) can reach a factor of 2.73. Hence, for high
   accuracy, it is best to use polarized IR to determine CO2 concentrations
   in apatite. For rough estimation, unpolarized IR spectra may be used by
   estimating A(total) = 3A(unpol), where A(unpol) is the integrated
   absorbance from unpolarized spectra.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the advantages, state-of-the-art, and current challenges
   in the field of adaptive composite marine propulsors and turbines are
   reviewed. Adaptive composites are used in numerous marine technologies,
   including propulsive devices and control surfaces for marine vessels,
   offshore platforms, unmanned surface and underwater vehicles, and
   renewable energy harvesting devices. In the past, most marine propulsors
   and turbines have been designed as rigid bodies, simplifying the design
   and analysis process; however, this can lead to significant performance
   decay when operating in off-design conditions or in spatially or
   temporally varying flows. With recent advances in computational
   modeling, materials research, and manufacturing, it is possible to take
   advantage of the flexibility and anisotropic properties of composites to
   enable passive morphing capabilities to delay cavitation and improve
   overall energy efficiency, agility, and dynamic stability. Moreover,
   active materials can be embedded inside composites to enable energy
   harvesting, in situ health and condition monitoring, mitigation and
   control of flow-induced vibrations, and further enhancements of system
   performance. However, care is needed in the design and testing of
   adaptive composite marine propulsors and turbines to account for the
   inherent load-dependent deformations and to avoid potential material
   failures and hydroelastic instabilities (resonance, parametric
   excitations, divergence, flutter, buffeting, etc.). Here, we provide a
   summary of recent progress in the modeling, design, and optimization of
   adaptive composite marine propulsors and turbines, followed by a
   discussion of current challenges and future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltenes are the most polar molecules in crude oil and are
   responsible for a large number of deposition and fouling problems in the
   oil industry. The mechanisms by which asphaltenes deposit have not been
   fully elucidated, and the goal of this investigation is to reveal the
   underlying physics of the asphaltene deposition process. A new
   deposition apparatus was designed and constructed to investigate
   asphaltene deposition. The apparatus consists of a packed bed of
   stainless steel beads over which a mixture of oil and heptane is passed
   at a specified flow rate and run-time. The asphaltene deposition rate
   and the mass of deposit can be obtained along the packed bed. The
   dependency of the asphaltene deposition rate on concentration of
   unstable asphaltenes and on fluid flow velocity was studied.
   Experimental results show that a mass-transfer limited deposition model
   can explain the asphaltene deposition of nanometer-sized unstable
   asphaltenes in the viscous flow regime. This investigation sheds light
   on the asphaltene deposition process and provides a new tool that can be
   used to study asphaltene deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSCs) are adult multipotent cells,
   which have the potential to differentiate into cell types of mesodermal
   origin, namely osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. Due to their
   accessibility and expansion potential, BMSCs have historically held
   therapeutic promise in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine
   applications. More recently, it has been demonstrated that not only can
   bone marrow stromal stem cells directly participate in tissue
   regeneration, but they also have the capacity to migrate to distant
   sites of tissue injury, where they can participate in tissue repair
   either directly through their differentiation or indirectly through
   paracrine mechanisms. Additionally, they can elicit various
   immunomodulatory signals, which can attenuate the inflammatory and
   immune responses. As such, bone marrow stromal stem cells have been
   explored clinically for treatment of a wide variety of different
   conditions including bone defects, graft-vs.-host disease,
   cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, neurological
   diseases, and liver and kidney diseases. This review provides an
   overview of current clinical applications of bone marrow stromal stem
   cells and discusses their therapeutic properties, while also addressing
   limitations of their use. PubMed, Ovid, and Google Scholar online
   databases were searched using several keywords, including ``stem
   cells{''}, ``tissue engineering{''}, tissue regeneration{''} and
   ``clinical trials{''}. Additionally, Clinical trials.gov was used to
   locate completed clinical trials using bone marrow derived stem cells.}},

Pages = {{1301-1315}},

Abstract = {{We propose a rheological model for ideal thixotropy, defined as a
   reversible time-dependent shear-thinning viscous response, in both shear
   rate-controlled (RC Model) and stress-controlled (SC Model) forms. The
   model introduces a spectrum of structure parameters that collectively
   relaxes as a stretched exponential. It retains time-invariance symmetry
   with only a stretching exponent beta as an additional model parameter
   relative to conventional single-structure-parameter models. The kinetic
   equations are nonlinear in both the structure parameters and the flow
   parameters of strain rate or stress. We demonstrate that introducing
   multiple structure parameters can successfully capture the
   stretched-exponential and nonmonotonic evolution of stress or shear rate
   in general step tests; and using nonlinear kinetic equations can explain
   the relaxation time's dependence on both the initial and final values of
   shear rate or stress in step tests. We present rheological data for a
   fumed silica dispersion in a number of shear histories including steady
   state, step shear rate, step stress, shear-rate ramp, and stress ramp. A
   systematic way to parameterize the models is provided. Both models fit
   experimental data well although the SC Model provides better agreement
   with the measurements. The ideal thixotropic models can be combined with
   existing methods that incorporate viscoelasticity so as to extend their
   validity into the region of low shear rates. (C) 2016 The Society of

Abstract = {{Purpose: To demonstrate that MR sequences can detect individual
   histotripsy bubble clouds formed inside intact tissues.
   Methods: A line-scan and an EPI sequence were sensitized to histotripsy
   by inserting a bipolar gradient whose lobes bracketed the lifespan of a
   histotripsy bubble cloud. Using a 7 Tesla, small-bore scanner, these
   sequences monitored histotripsy clouds formed in an agar phantom and in
   vitro porcine liver and brain. The bipolar gradients were adjusted to
   apply phase with k-space frequencies of 10, 300 or 400 cm(-1). Acoustic
   pressure amplitude was also varied. Cavitation was simultaneously
   monitored using a passive cavitation detection system.
   Results: Each image captured local signal loss specific to an individual
   bubble cloud. In the agar phantom, this signal loss appeared only when
   the transducer output exceeded the cavitation threshold pressure. In
   tissues, bubble clouds were immediately detected when the gradients
   created phase with k-space frequencies of 300 and 400 cm(-1). When the
   gradients created phase with a k-space frequency of 10 cm(-1),
   individual bubble clouds were not detectable until many acoustic pulses
   had been applied to the tissue.
   Conclusion: Cavitation-sensitive MR-sequences can detect single
   histotripsy bubble clouds formed in biologic tissue. Detection is
   influenced by the sensitizing gradients and treatment history. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Source-separated human urine was collected from six public events to
   study the impact of urine processing and storage on bacterial community
   composition and viability. Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a
   complex community of bacteria in fresh urine that differed across
   collection events. Despite the harsh chemical conditions of stored urine
   (pH > 9 and total ammonia nitrogen > 4000 mg N/L), bacteria consistently
   grew to 5 +/- 2 X10(8) cells/mL. Storing hydrolyzed urine for any amount
   of time significantly reduced the number of operational taxonomic units
   (OTUs) to 130 +/- 70, increased Pielou evenness to 0.60 +/- 0.06, and
   produced communities dominated by Clostridiales and Lactobacillales.
   After 80 days of storage, all six urine samples from different starting
   materials converged to these characteristics. Urine pasteurization or
   struvite precipitation did not change the microbial community, even when
   pasteurized urine was stored for an additional 70 days. Pasteurization
   decreased metabolic activity by 50 +/- 10\% and additional storage after
   pasteurization did not lead to recovery of metabolic activity.
   Urine-derived fertilizers consistently contained 16S rRNA genes
   belonging to Tissierella, Erysipelothrix, Atopostipes, Bacteroides, and
   many Clostridiales OTUs; additional experiments must determine whether
   pathogenic species are present, responsible for observed metabolic
   activity, or regrow when applied.}},

   achieving a similar amplitude level near the resonance frequency.
   Furthermore, the bandwidth of the nonlinear resonator is independent of

Abstract = {{It is necessary to develop an efficient optimization technique to
   perform optimum designs which have given design spaces, discrete design
   values and several design goals. As optimization techniques, direct
   search method and stochastic search method are widely used in designing
   of ship structures. The merit of the direct search method is to search
   the optimum points rapidly by considering the search direction, step
   size and convergence limit. And the merit of the stochastic search
   method is to obtain the global optimum points well by spreading points
   randomly entire the design spaces. In this paper, Pareto Strategy (PS)
   multi-objective function method is developed by considering the search
   direction based on Pareto optimal points, the step size, the convergence
   limit and the random number generation. The success points between just
   before and current Pareto optimal points are considered. PS method can
   also apply to the single objective function problems, and can consider
   the discrete design variables such as plate thickness, longitudinal
   space, web height and web space. The optimum design results are compared
   with existing Random Search (RS) multi-objective function method and
   Evolutionary Strategy (ES) multi-objective function method by performing
   the optimum designs of double bottom structure and double hull tanker
   which have discrete design values. Its superiority and effectiveness are
   shown by comparing the optimum results with those of RS method and ES
   method. Copyright (C) 2016 Society of Naval Architects of Korea.

Title = {{Nanoelectronic Heterodyne Sensor: A New Electronic Sensing Paradigm}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2578-2586}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{CONSPECTUS: Nanoelectronic devices based on nanomaterials such as
   nanowires, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and other 2D nanomaterials offer
   extremely large surface to -volume ratios, high carrier mobility, low
   power consumption, and high compatibility for integration with modern
   electronic technologies. These distinct advantages promise great
   potential for nanoelectronic devices as next generation chemical and
   biological sensors. Currently, majority of existing nanoelectronic
   sensors are direct current (DC) sensors, which rely ubiquitously on
   detection of conductance change associated with molecular adsorption.
   However, despite the simplicity of the conventional DC sensing
   technology, it also has severe limitations such as the Debye screening
   effect in ionic solutions, and the speed-sensitivity trade-off for the
   detection of charge-neutral molecules. Hence, the development of
   nanoelectronic sensors calls for new sensing platform technologies that
   can truly showcase the advantages of electronic sensors. In this
   Account, we will summarize recent efforts from our group on the
   development of a new electronic sensing paradigm, the nanoelectronic
   heterodyne sensors. Unlike conventional charge-detection based sensors,
   the heterodyne sensor explores the frequency mixing response between
   molecular dipoles and a nanoscale transistor. As an example, we first
   discuss the capability of heterodyne sensing in gas sensing applications
   by using graphene devices. Rapid (down to 0.1 s) and sensitive (down to
   1 ppb) detection of a wide range of vapor analytes is achieved,
   representing orders of magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art
   nanoelectronic sensors. Furthermore, the heterodyne sensing technique
   enables electrical probing and tuning of the noncovalent physisorption
   of polar molecules on graphene surface for the first time. These results
   provide insight into small molecule-nanomaterial interaction dynamics
   and signify the ability to electrically tailor interactions, which can
   lead to rational designs of complex chemical processes for catalysis and
   drug discovery. Finally, we discuss the application of heterodyne
   sensing in solution for chemical and biological sensors by using carbon
   nanotube devices. The fundamental ionic screening effect can be
   mitigated by operating carbon nanotube field effect transistor as a
   heterodyne biosensor. Electrical detection of streptavidin binding to
   biotin in 100 mM buffer solution can be achieved at a frequency beyond 1
   MHz. The results should promise a new biosensing platform for
   point-of-care detection, where biosensors functioning directly in
   physiologically relevant condition are desired.}},

Abstract = {{The immobilization of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to surfaces,
   enabling their utilization in biosensor and antibacterial/antifouling
   coating applications, is typically performed using rigid, solid support
   materials such as glass or gold and may require lengthy, temperamental
   protocols. Here, we employ a hydrogel immobilization platform to afford
   facile fabrication and surface functionalization while offering improved
   biocompatibility for evaluating the influence of linker length, surface
   density, and AMP conjugation site on retained peptide activity. Rapid,
   interfacial photo-polymerization using the radical-mediated thiol-ene
   addition mechanism was used to generate cross-linked, polymeric coatings
   bearing residual thiol moieties on prefabricated poly(ethylene glycol)
   (PEG)-based hydrogel supports. The photo-polymerized coatings were 60 mu
   m thick and contained 0.55 nmol of unreacted free thiols, corresponding
   to a concentration of 410 mu M, for use as cecropin A (CPA)
   immobilization handles via thiol-maleimide conjugation, where the
   CPA-bound maleimide moiety was localized at either the carboxyl terminus
   or midsequence between Ala(22) and Gly(23). Surface presentation of the
   thiol handles was controlled by varying the thiolated PEG monomer
   (PEGSH) used in the photo-polymerizable formulation. Bactericidal
   activity of CPA functionalized hydrogels against E. coli K235 indicated
   that CPA immobilized at the carboxyl terminus killed 94 +/- 6\% of the
   inoculated pathogens when coatings were prepared with high molecular
   weight PEGSH and 99 +/- 1\% when prepared with low molecular weight
   PEGSH. E. coli cell death demonstrated a stronger dependence on peptide
   concentration than PEG linker length or degree of thiol
   functionalization, with activity ranging from 34 +/- 13\% to 99 +/- 1\%
   bacterial cells killed as the prefunctionalization thiol concentration
   in the coatings was increased from 90 to 990 mu M. Finally, the
   immobilization site on the surface-bound CPA strongly affected
   antibacterial activity; when midsequence modified CPA was bound to a
   hydrogel coating bearing 990 mu M thiol, only 20 +/- 4\% of the E. coli
   population was killed.}},

Abstract = {{Microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) are a preferred cell source for
   autologous revascularization strategies, since they can be harvested and
   propagated from small tissue biopsies. Biomaterials-based strategies for
   therapeutic delivery of cells are aimed at tailoring the cellular micro
   environment to enhance the delivery, engraftment, and tissue specific
   function of transplanted cells. In the present study, we investigated a
   modular tissue engineering approach to therapeutic revascularization
   using fibrin-based microtissues containing embedded human MVEC and human
   fibroblasts-Cell 300 pm Vessel Network (FB). Microtissues were formed
   using a water-in-oil emulsion process that produced populations of
   spheroidal tissue modules with a diameter of 100-200 mu m. The formation
   of MVEC sprouts within a fibrin matrix over 7 days in culture was
   dependent on the presence of FB, with the most robust sprouting
   occurring at a 1:3 MVEC:FB ratio. Cell viability in microtissues was
   high (>90\%) and significant FB cell proliferation was observed over
   time in culture. Robust sprouting from microtissues was evident, with
   larger vessels developing over time and FB acting as pericyte-like cells
   by enveloping endothelial tubes. These neovessels were shown to form an
   interconnected vascular plexus over 14 days of culture when microtissues
   were embedded in a surrounding fibrin hydrogel. Vessel networks
   exhibited branching and inosculation of sprouts from adjacent
   microtissues, resulting in MVEC-lined capillaries with hollow lumens.
   Microtissues maintained in suspension culture aggregated to form larger
   tissue masses (1-2 mm in diameter) over 7 days. Vessels formed within
   microtissue aggregates at a 1:1 MVEC:FB ratio were small and diffuse,
   whereas the 1:3 MVEC:FB ratio produced large and highly interconnected
   vessels by day 14. This study highlights the utility of human MVEC as a
   cell source for revascularization strategies, and suggests that the
   ratio of endothelial to support cells can be used to tailor vessel
   characteristics. The modular microtissue format may allow minimally
   invasive delivery of populations of prevascularized microtissues for
   therapeutic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Solar-tracking concentrators can potentially lead to low-cost
   photovoltaic modules that minimize the use of costly semiconductor
   materials by improving optical collection and coupling. However, solar
   concentrators and accompanying trackers have proven to be expensive,
   bulky, and heavy, thereby resulting in increased balance-of-system
   costs. Here we demonstrate a lightweight and low-profile, and
   potentially low-cost planar solar-tracking concentrator based on the
   ancient Japanese art of origami. The tightly packed hexagonal
   concentrator and tracker arrays are fabricated by cutting and folding
   thin reflecting sheets that capture and direct concentrated light onto a

Abstract = {{Feedback-driven online homework systems provide students with a
   comprehensive set of practice questions that can accompany and enhance
   other instructional resources. However, the available e-homework systems
   do not contain content that aligns well with our course objectives,
   provide too few questions in key areas, and use assessment format(s)
   that do not match the ones used on our exams. Motivated to create our
   own questions, we used this gap as an opportunity to engage students in
   constructing and reviewing course-aligned content within a commercial
   e-homework platform. The students successfully generated approximately
   1,000 largely open-ended organic chemistry questions, some with
   mechanistic and structural drawing capabilities, by modifying old exam
   questions. The students' questions spanned a variety of cognitive levels
   that skewed, as intended, toward skill-building. According to our
   assessment scheme, 75\% of the questions were evaluated to be of the
   highest quality. As a consequence, we advocate that collaborating with
   undergraduate students in a ``teaching team{''} can be a broadly useful
   way for instructors to generate. high-quality instructional materials
   aligned with their course content.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{Electron-filtering compound buffer layers (EF-CBLs) improve charge
   extraction in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) by blending an
   electron-conducting fullerene with a wide energy gap exciton-blocking
   molecule. It is found that devices with EF-CBLs with high glass
   transition temperatures and a low crystallization rate produce highly
   stable morphologies and devices. The most stable OPVs employ 1:1
   2,2,2-(1,3,5-benzenetriyl tris-{[}1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole] TPBi:C-70
   buffers that lose <20\% of their initial power conversion efficiency of
   6.6 +/- 0.6\% after 2700 h under continuous simulated AM1.5G
   illumination, and show no significant degradation after 100 days of
   outdoor aging. When exposed to 100-sun (100 kW m(-2)) concentrated solar
   illumination for 5 h, their power conversion efficiencies decrease by
   <8\%. Moreover, it is found that the reliability of the devices
   employing stable EF-CBLs has either reduced or no dependence on
   operating temperature up to 130 degrees C compared with BPhen:C-60
   devices whose fill factors show thermally activated degradation. The
   robustness of TPBi:C-70 devices under extreme aging conditions including
   outdoor exposure, high temperature, and concentrated illumination is
   promising for the future of OPV as a stable solar cell technology.}},

Abstract = {{Solid tumors develop as 3D tissue constructs. As tumors grow larger,
   spatial gradients of nutrients and oxygen and inadequate diffusive
   supply to cells distant from vasculature develops. Hypoxia initiates
   signaling and transcriptional alterations to promote survival of cancer
   cells and generation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that have self-renewal
   and tumor-initiation capabilities. Both hypoxia and CSCs are associated
   with resistance to therapies and tumor relapse. This study demonstrates
   that 3D cancer cell models, known as tumor spheroids, generated with a
   polymeric aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) technology capture these
   important biological processes. Similar to solid tumors, spheroids of
   triple negative breast cancer cells deposit major extracellular matrix
   proteins. The molecular analysis establishes presence of hypoxic cells
   in the core region and expression of CSC gene and protein markers
   including CD24, CD133, and Nanog. Importantly, these spheroids resist
   treatment with chemotherapy drugs. A combination treatment approach
   using a hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, and a chemotherapy drug,
   doxorubicin, successfully targets drug resistant spheroids. This study
   demonstrates that ATPS spheroids recapitulate important biological and
   functional properties of solid tumors and provide a unique model for
   studies in cancer research.}},

   concrete subjected to various pullout rates}},
Journal = {{CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fiber-matrix bond properties are typically evaluated using a
   single-fiber pullout test. Such tests for ultra-high performance
   concrete (UHPC) are few in the literature and, in particular, those that
   focus on high pullout rates are exceedingly rare. In this research
   program, different types of high-strength steel fibers (twisted,
   straight and hooked) are embedded in two UHPC matrices with varying
   amounts of glass powder, which is a key ingredient of UPHC. The
   specimens are subjected to loading rates ranging from 0.018 mm/s
   (representing quasi-static loading) to 1800 mm/s (representing impact
   loading). Experimental results show that the pullout response of all of
   the fiber types exhibit progressively increasing rate sensitivity as the
   pullout speed increases and becomes significant during impact loading.
   It is most prominent in the smooth and twisted fibers and least in the
   hooked fibers. Additionally, scanning electron microscope studies are
   presented and used to explain the mechanism of rate enhancement from a
   microscopic perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A corner preserving algorithm for realistic DEM soil particle generation}},
Journal = {{GRANULAR MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An efficient particle clump generation algorithm for use in discrete
   element methods (DEMs) was developed to simulate actual particles in a
   granular specimen. The algorithm requires many fewer circles than
   existing methods, particularly for angular particles. The procedure is a
   logical extension of a computational method for determining the classic
   Wadell particle roundness in which circles are fitted to the corners of
   particles. Hence, the new method perfectly preserves the location, size
   and shape of particle corners and is appropriately termed the corner
   preserving algorithm. The remaining perimeter of the particle, which
   includes concave and flat sections, is fitted with non-corner circles.
   Unlike earlier methods, the corner preserving algorithm requires only a
   single control parameter to generate the circles. This parameter is the
   ratio of the clump area to the original particle area, AR. An algorithm
   seeks a corresponding optimum clump roughness that achieves the
   user-prescribed AR. The method can easily be incorporated in existing
   soil particle characterization systems in which binary images or even
   images of particle assemblies are produced. Examples illustrate the
   simplicity and advantages of the corner preserving algorithm for DEM
   clump generation.}},

Abstract = {{Propagation of terahertz (THz) wave utilizing spoof surface plasmon
   polariton (SSPP) earned a great deal of attention due to the ability of
   SSPP modes to guide THz waves at very low dispersion. We present an
   investigation of the SSPP beam splitter, one of the key elements of many
   optical setups. In contrast with conventional free space
   implementations, in the case of the SSPP beam splitter, one can no
   longer disregard scattering of incoming wave back into the input
   channels. Thus, SSPP implementations must take into consideration both
   the splitting ratio and the backscattering as important parameters
   characterizing the beam splitter. Three different designs representing
   different approaches to solving the problem of the relation between
   these parameters are investigated. The mathematical formalism to study
   the dispersion diagrams is proposed. The frequency dependence of
   splitting ratio, scattering parameters, and backscattering for each beam
   splitter is investigated. Finally, by employing one of the proposed beam
   splitter, a controllable filter is designed and analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Laminar natural convection heat transfer in a differentially heated
   cavity with two thin porous fins attached to the hot wall and bottom
   insulated surface was studied numerically for various pertinent
   parameters. Such parameters include Richardson number, Darcy number,
   thermal conductivity ratio, and location of the porous fin. The left
   wall of the cavity is assumed to be uniformly heated while the right
   wall is kept at a lower temperature. In addition, the horizontal walls
   of the cavity were considered insulated. Furthermore, the governing
   transport equations within the porous media were written according to
   the volume-average theory. The governing equations are solved using a
   finite element formulation based on the Galerkin method of weighted
   residuals. The results of this investigation showed that the presence of
   a horizontal porous fin increases the average Nusselt number when
   compared with the differentially heated cavity for various Richardson
   numbers and thermal conductivity ratios. However, a vertical porous fin
   attached to the bottom insulated surface exhibited a lower average
   Nusselt number than the no-fin case. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Predicting the Impact of Scientific Concepts Using Full-Text Features}},

Abstract = {{New scientific concepts, interpreted broadly, are continuously
   introduced in the literature, but relatively few concepts have a
   long-term impact on society. The identification of such concepts is a
   challenging prediction task that would help multiple parties-including
   researchers and the general public-focus their attention within the vast
   scientific literature. In this paper we present a system that predicts
   the future impact of a scientific concept, represented as a technical
   term, based on the information available from recently published
   research articles. We analyze the usefulness of rich features derived
   from the full-text of the articles through a variety of approaches,
   including rhetorical sentence analysis, information extraction, and
   time-series analysis. The results from two large-scale experiments with
   3.8 million full-text articles and 48 million metadata records support
   the conclusion that full-text features are significantly more useful for
   prediction than metadata-only features and that the most accurate
   predictions result from combining the metadata and full-text features.
   Surprisingly, these results hold even when the metadata features are
   available for a much larger number of documents than are available for
   the full-text features.}},

Title = {{A scintillator-based approach to monitor secondary neutron production
   during proton therapy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{5915-5924}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The primary objective of this work is to measure the secondary
   neutron field produced by an uncollimated proton pencil beam impinging
   on different tissue-equivalent phantom materials using organic
   scintillation detectors. Additionally, the Monte Carlo code MCNPX-PoliMi
   was used to simulate the detector response for comparison to the
   measured data. Comparison of the measured and simulated data will
   validate this approach for monitoring secondary neutron dose during
   proton therapy.
   Methods: Proton beams of 155- and 200-MeV were used to irradiate a
   variety of phantom materials and secondary particles were detected using
   organic liquid scintillators. These detectors are sensitive to fast
   neutrons and gamma rays: pulse shape discrimination was used to classify
   each detected pulse as either a neutron or a gamma ray. The McNPx-PoliMi
   code was used to simulate the secondary neutron field produced during
   proton irradiation of the same tissue-equivalent phantom materials.
   Results: An experiment was performed at the Loma Linda University
   Medical Center proton therapy research beam line and corresponding
   models were created using the MCNPX-PoliMi code. The authors' analysis
   showed agreement between the simulations and the measurements. The
   simulated detector response can be used to validate the simulations of
   neutron and gamma doses on a particular beam line with or without a
   phantom.
   Conclusions: The authors have demonstrated a method of monitoring the
   neutron component of the secondary radiation field produced by
   therapeutic protons. The method relies on direct detection of secondary
   neutrons and gamma rays using organic scintillation detectors. These
   detectors are sensitive over the full range of biologically relevant
   neutron energies above 0.5 MeV and allow effective discrimination
   between neutron and photon dose. Because the detector system is
   portable, the described system could be used in the future to evaluate
   secondary neutron and gamma doses on various clinical beam lines for
   commissioning and prospective data collection in pediatric patients
   treated with proton therapy. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists

Abstract = {{Despite their different chemistries, novel energy-storage systems, e.g.,
   Li-air, Li-S, all-solid-state Li batteries, etc., face one critical
   challenge of forming a conductive and stable interface between Li metal
   and a solid electrolyte. An accurate understanding of the formation
   mechanism and the exact structure and chemistry of the rarely existing
   benign interfaces, such as the Li cubic-Li7-3xAlxLa3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO)
   interface, is crucial for enabling the use of Li metal anodes. Due to
   spatial confinement and structural and chemical complications, current
   investigations are largely limited to theoretical calculations. Here,
   through an in situ formation of Li-c-LLZO interfaces inside an
   aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, we
   successfully reveal the interfacial chemical and structural progression.
   Upon contact with Li metal, the LLZO surface is reduced, which is
   accompanied by the simultaneous implantation of Li+, resulting in a
   tetragonal-like LLZO interphase that stabilizes at an extremely small
   thickness of around five unit cells. This interphase effectively
   prevented further interfacial reactions without compromising the ionic
   conductivity. Although the cubic-to-tetragonal transition is typically
   undesired during LLZO synthesis, the similar structural change was found
   to be the likely key to the observed benign interface. These insights
   provide a new perspective for designing Li-solid electrolyte interfaces
   that can enable the use of Li metal anodes in next-generation batteries.}},

Abstract = {{The electromechanical properties of an acoustic wave propagating in a
   piezoelectric media can be tuned by modulation of the resistivity of the
   piezoelectric material. This is readily available in piezoelectric
   semiconductor materials, wherein acoustic phonons and charge carriers
   can interact. In this work, we employ epitaxially grown AlGaN/GaN
   heterostructures in bulk acoustic wave resonators with Schottky
   interdigitated transducers biased in the depletion region to study the
   interaction between piezoelectric strain and depletion charges. By
   modulating the impedance of the depletion layer upon application of DC
   voltages, we tune the acoustic properties of bulk-mode resonators and
   show significant Q enhancement as the result of a depletion force added
   to the piezoelectric actuation force. Furthermore, we compare the
   performance of such resonators with pure GaN piezoelectric resonators
   that have the same geometry but with the AlGaN layer removed. When
   integrated with AlGaN/GaN HEMTs (located on the acoustic cavity or next
   to the resonator), such resonators can be used as frequency references
   in oscillator circuits in radio frequency (RF) blocks or utilized in
   harsh environment sensing applications. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH

Abstract = {{Little is known about the factors that regulate the asymmetric division
   of cancer stem-like cells (CSC). Here, we demonstrate that EGFL6, a stem
   cell regulatory factor expressed in ovarian tumor cells and vasculature,
   regulates ALDH(+) ovarian CSC. EGFL6 signaled at least in part via the
   oncoprotein SHP2 with concomitant activation of ERK. EGFL6 signaling
   promoted the migration and asymmetric division of ALDH(+) ovarian CSC.
   As such, EGFL6 increased not only tumor growth but also metastasis.
   Silencing of EGFL6 or SHP2 limited numbers of ALDH(+) cells and reduced
   tumor growth, supporting a critical role for EGFL6/SHP2 in ALDH(+) cell
   maintenance. Notably, systemic administration of an EGFL6-neutralizing
   antibody we generated restricted tumor growth and metastasis,
   specifically blocking ovarian cancer cell recruitment to the ovary.
   Together, our results offer a preclinical proof of concept for EGFL6 as
   a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian cancer.}},

Abstract = {{AimsTo study the effect of the recombinant human bone morphogenetic
   protein 2 (rhBMP-2) on sinus volumetric and histometric changes after
   sinus floor augmentation compared to a conventional approach of
   non-biologic bone grafting materials.
   Materials and methodsAn electronic search of 4 databases (January
   1990-February 2015), including PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science
   and Cochrane Central, and a hand search of peer-reviewed journals for
   relevant articles were performed. Human clinical trials with data on
   comparison of sinus volumetric and/or histometric outcomes with and
   without the use of rhBMP-2 in sinus grafting procedures, with 10
   augmentation sites in each study group, and with a follow-up period of
   at least 6months, were included. Random-effects meta-analyses were
   performed to analyze weighted mean difference (WMD) and confidence
   interval (CI) for the recorded variables according to PRISMA guidelines.
   ResultsSix randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The
   results of the meta-analyses showed that the WMD of vertical bone height
   gain was -0.14mm (95\% CI=-1.91 to 1.62mm, P=0.87), the WMD of bone
   density was -142.42mg/cm(3) (95\% CI=-310.62-25.78mg/cm(3), P=0.10), the
   WMD of the percentage of vital bone was -4.59\% (95\% CI=-11.73-2.56\%,
   P=0.21), and the WMD of the percentage of residual bone grafting
   materials was -9.90\% (95\% CI=-26.38-6.58\%, P=0.21). The comparison of
   implant survival rate presented an overall risk ratio of 1.00 (95\%
   CI=0.94-1.07). The two approaches (conventional bone grafting compared
   to BMPs) demonstrated comparable effectiveness for both clinical and
   histomorphometric measures.
   ConclusionsThis systematic review revealed that the use of rhBMP-2 in
   maxillary sinus floor augmentation achieved similar clinical and
   histometric outcomes when compared to conventional sinus grafting
   procedures after a healing period of 6-9months. However, previous
   studies showed the morbidity and other patient-reported outcomes were
   improved in rhBMP-2 approaches as compared to bone autograft procedures
   (both intraoral and extraoral bone harvesting because no donor site is
   required). Long-term studies are required to determine the cost-benefit
   of sinus floor augmentation procedures for patients requiring implant
   reconstruction.}},

Volume = {{311}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel spline, named B++ Splines (Boundary Plus Plus Splines), is
   developed to address the expression of a trimmed NURBS patch in an
   analytic form, which is a central idea of surface representation. The
   presented method converts each trimmed NURBS patch into a B++ spline
   patch that incorporates of specific boundary points as the boundary
   presentation. Emphasis is placed on the construction of a new analytic
   formula of a trimmed NURBS patch defined by the boundary points at the
   trimming curves and a group of enriched control points. B++ spline basis
   functions are linearly independent, build a partition of unity and
   satisfy the Kronecker delta property. Each B++ spline basis function is
   a linear combination of the basis functions of the trimmed NURBS patch.
   These properties allow imposing the Dirichlet boundary conditions
   strongly at the boundary of the trimmed patch without the necessity of
   modifying the basis functions of the trimmed patch. Isogeometric
   analysis using B++ splines for two-dimensional elastic solids is also
   proposed. Several numerical examples are used to demonstrate the
   reliability of the presented method. The numerical example for the patch
   test illustrates that the B++ spline patch passes the standard patch
   test. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{311}},
Pages = {{556-575}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{We consider solid state phase transformations that are caused by free
   energy densities with domains of non-convexity in strain-composition
   space; we refer to the non-convex domains as mechano-chemical spinodals.
   The non-convexity with respect to composition and strain causes
   segregation into phases with different crystal structures. We work on an
   existing model that couples the classical Cahn-Hilliard model with
   Toupin's theory of gradient elasticity at finite strains. Both systems
   are represented by fourth-order, nonlinear, partial differential
   equations. The goal of this work is to develop unconditionally stable,
   second order accurate time-integration schemes, motivated by the need to
   carry out large scale computations of dynamically evolving
   microstructures in three dimensions. We also introduce reduced
   formulations naturally derived from these proposed schemes for faster
   computations that are still second-order accurate. Although our method
   is developed and analyzed here for a specific class of mechano-chemical
   problems, one can readily apply the same method to develop
   unconditionally stable, second-order accurate schemes for any problems
   for which free energy density functions are multivariate polynomials of
   solution components and component gradients. Apart from an analysis and
   construction of methods, we present a suite of numerical results that
   demonstrate the schemes in action. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Given that sustainable energy production and advanced wastewater
   treatment for producing clean water are two major challenges faced by
   modern society, microalgae make a desirable treatment alternative by
   providing a renewable biomass feedstock for biofuel production, while
   treating wastewater as a growth medium. Micro-algae have been known to
   be resilient to the toxic contaminants of highly concentrated organic
   wastewater (e.g., organic nitrogen, phosphorus, and salinity) and are
   excellent at sorbing heavy metals and emerging contaminants. Economic
   and environmental advantages associated with massive algae culturing in
   wastewater constitute a driving force to promote its utilization as a
   feedstock for biofuels. However, there are still many challenges to be
   resolved which have impeded the development of algal biofuel technology
   at a commercial scale. This review provides an overview of an integrated
   approach using microalgae for wastewater treatment, CO2 utilization, and
   biofuel production. The main goal of this article is to promote research
   in algae technologies by outlining critical needs along the integrated
   process train, including cultivation, harvesting, and biofuel
   production. Various aspects associated with design challenges of
   microalgae production are described and current developments in algae
   cultivation and pretreatment of algal biomass for biofuel production are
   also discussed. Furthermore, synergistic coupling of the use of
   microalgae for advanced wastewater treatment and biofuel production is
   highlighted in a sustainability context using life cycle analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We present a near-field radio system for a millimeter-scale wireless
   smart sensor node that is implantable through a 14-gauge syringe needle.
   The proposed system integrates a radio system on chip and a magnetic
   antenna on a glass substrate within a total dimension of 1 x 1 x 10
   mm(3). We demonstrate energy-efficient active near-field wireless
   communication between the millimeter-scale sensor node and a base
   station device through an RF energy-absorbing tissue. The wireless
   transceiver, digital baseband controller, wakeup controller, on-chip
   baseband timer, sleep timer, and MBUS controller are all integrated on
   the SoC to form a millimeter-scale sensor node, together with a 1 x 8
   mm(2) magnetic antenna fabricated with a 1.5-mu m-thickness gold on a
   100 mu m-thickness glass substrate. An asymmetric link is established
   pairing the sensor antenna with a codesigned 11x11 cm(2) base station
   antenna to achieve a link distance of up to 50 cm for sensor
   transmission and 20 cm for sensor reception. The transmitter consumes a
   43.5 mu W average power at 2 kb/s, while the receiver power consumption
   is 36 mu W with a -54 dBm sensitivity at 100 kb/s. When powered by a
   1x2.2 mm(2) thin-film battery (2 mu Ah, 4.1 V), the designed system has
   a two week expected lifetime without battery recharging when the system
   wakes up and transmits and receives 16 b data every 10 min.}},

Abstract = {{A 320 GHz fully integrated terahertz imaging system is reported. The
   system is composed of a phase-locked high-power transmitter and a
   coherent high-sensitivity subharmonic-mixing receiver, which are
   fabricated using a 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology (f(T)/f(max) = 220/280
   GHz). To enhance the imaging sensitivity, a heterodyne coherent
   detection scheme is utilized. To obtain frequency coherency, fully
   integrated phase-locked loops are implemented on both the transmitter
   and receiver chips. According to the measurement results, consuming a
   total dc power of 605 mW, the transmitter chip achieves a peak radiated
   power of 2 mW and a peak EIRP of 21.1 dBm. The receiver chip achieves an
   equivalent incoherent responsivity of more than 7.26 MV/W and a
   sensitivity of 70.1 pW under an integration bandwidth of 1 kHz, with a
   total dc power consumption of 117 mW. The achieved sensitivity with this
   proposed coherent imaging transceiver is around ten times better
   compared with other state-of-the-art incoherent imagers. To the best of
   our knowledge, this paper demonstrates the first fully integrated
   coherent terahertz imaging transceiver on silicon.}},

Abstract = {{A series of M/Mo2C (M = Cu, Pd, Co and Fe) were synthesized and
   evaluated for CO2 hydrogenation at 135-200 degrees C in liquid
   1,4-dioxane solvent. The Mo2C served as both a support and a co-catalyst
   for CO2 hydrogenation, exhibiting turnover frequencies of 0.6 x 10(-4)
   and 20 x 10(-4) s(-1) at 135 and 200 degrees C, respectively. Methanol
   was the major product at 135 degrees C, while CH3OH, C2H5OH, and C2+
   hydrocarbons were produced at 200 degrees C. The addition of Cu and Pd
   onto the high surface area Mo2C enhanced the production of CH3OH, while
   Co and Fe enhanced the production of C2+ hydrocarbons. Results for CO2,
   CO, and CH3OH hydrogenation experiments suggested that CO2 was the
   primary source for CH3OH while CO was the intermediate to hydrocarbons
   during CO2 hydrogenation. Characterization of the spent M/Mo2C catalysts
   revealed very little change in the surface and bulk chemistries and
   structures, indicating their stability in the liquid environment. (C)

Abstract = {{This article seeks to reduce the stiffness of NiTi parts from a
   nonporous state to that of human bone by introducing porosity. Compact
   bone stiffness is between 12 and 20GPa while the currently used bone
   implant materials are several times stiffer. While very stiff implants
   and/or fixation hardware can temporarily immobilize healing bone, it
   also causes stress shielding of the surrounding bone and commonly
   results in stress concentrations at the implant or immobilization
   hardware's fixation site(s). Together these processes can lead to
   implant or fixation hardware and/or the surrounding bone's failure.
   Porous NiTi can be used to reduce the stiffness of metallic implants
   while also providing necessary stabilization or immobilization of the
   patient's reconstructed anatomy. In this work, mechanical behavior of
   porous NiTi with different levels of porosity is simulated to show the
   relation between the stiffness and porosity level. Then porous
   structures are fabricated through additive manufacturing to validate the
   simulation results. The results indicate that stiffness can be reduced
   from the bulk value of 69GPa to as low as 20.5GPa for 58\% porosity. The
   simulation shows that it is possible to achieve a wide range of desired
   stiffness by adjusting the level of porosity.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we fabricated and characterized two kinds of Al-doped
   Li6.2La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) powders with the modified sol-gel synthesis and
   solid-state processing, respectively. Moreover, the two kinds of LLZO
   powders were compared in detail examining the powder size and processing
   window for the cubic phase. In the case of the sol-gel synthesis, the
   processed powder exhibited a pure cubic phase with little secondary
   phases such as Li-deficient pyrochlore or LaAlO3 at calcination
   temperatures above 900 degrees C and a mixed phase of cubic and
   tetragonal structure at 800 degrees C. However, in the solid-state
   processed powder, the tetragonal phase was converted to a cubic one at a
   temperature of 1000 degrees C. When the amount of Li addition was
   varied, sol-gel synthesized LLZO powder also had a much wider range for
   cubic phases than that of the solid-state processed one. The sol-gel
   LLZO powder with a Li addition of 7.13 mol. showed an average grain size
   of 429 nm and a specific BET surface area of 5.34 m(2)/g. The formation
   of the cubic phase with few secondary ones was sensitive to Al doping
   amount. The results of this study suggest that the sol-gel process is
   the more optimum method for obtaining the cubic phase of LLZO powder for
   highly dense and conductive solid electrolyte ceramics.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional numerical simulations are applied to model radiative
   heat transfer in a dispersed particle phase exhibiting preferential
   concentration typical of a turbulent, particle-laden flow environment.
   The dispersed phase is composed of micron-sized nickel particles, and
   the carrier phase is non-participating. The simulations are performed
   for a snapshot of the particle field using the Monte Carlo Ray Tracing
   method, and the spectral dependence of the optical properties is
   considered. Interaction between the particles and radiation is modeled
   by projecting the particle locations onto an Eulerian mesh. Results show
   that the optically thin approximation results in errors in predicted
   particle heat transfer of up to 35\% at some locations in the particle
   field. Oxidation is shown to change the absorption efficiency of the
   particles significantly, while consideration of non spherical particle
   shapes results in relatively small changes in the predicted optical
   properties of the particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microstress in reaction-bonded silicon carbide (RBSiC) has been measured
   using piezo-Raman spectroscopy. Compressive microstresses as high as 2
   GPa exist in the silicon phase and tensile microstresses as high as 2.3
   GPa exist in the SiC phase of RBSiC. This is much larger than expected
   for thermoelastic microstress from coefficient of thermal expansion
   mismatch would provide. Instead the microstresses arise from the
   crystallization of liquid silicon. During the reaction bonding process,
   not all of the silicon reacts to form SiC and there is liquid free
   silicon. The phase transformation of the free silicon from liquid to
   solid has a large volume expansion, which results in large residual
   microstress within the silicon and SiC phases of RBSiC.}},

Abstract = {{Spheroids present a biologically relevant three-dimensional model of
   avascular tumors and a unique tool for discovery of anticancer drugs.
   Despite being used in research laboratories for several decades,
   spheroids are not routinely used in the mainstream drug discovery
   pipeline primarily due to the difficulty of mass-producing uniformly
   sized spheroids and intense labor involved in handling, drug treatment,
   and analyzing spheroids. We overcome this barrier using a polymeric
   aqueous two-phase microtechnology to robotically microprint spheroids of
   well-defined size in standard 384-microwell plates. We use different
   cancer cells and show that resulting spheroids grow over time and
   display characteristic features of solid tumors. We demonstrate the
   feasibility of robotic, high-throughput screening of 25 standard
   chemotherapeutics and molecular inhibitors against tumor spheroids of
   three different cancer cell lines. This screening uses over 7000
   spheroids to elicit high quality dose-dependent drug responses from
   spheroids. To quantitatively compare performance of different drugs, we
   employ a multiparametric scoring system using half-maximum inhibitory
   concentration (IC50), maximum inhibition (E-max), and area under the
   dose response curve (AUC) to take into account both potency and efficacy
   parameters. This approach allows us to identify several compounds that
   effectively inhibit growth of spheroids and compromise cellular
   viability, and distinguish them from moderately effective and
   ineffective drugs. Using protein expression analysis, we demonstrate
   that spheroids generated with the aqueous two-phase microtechnology
   reliably resolve molecular targets of drug compounds. Incorporating this
   low-cost and convenient-to-use tumor spheroid technology in preclinical
   drug discovery will make compound screening with realistic tumor models
   a routine laboratory technique prior to expensive and tedious animal
   tests to dramatically improve testing throughput and efficiency and
   reduce costs of drug discovery.}},

   in piezoresistive nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Carbon nanofiller-modified composites have incredible potential for
   self-sensing, structural health monitoring (SHM), and damage
   identification because they are piezoresistive. This means that
   conductivity changes can be monitored to detect mechanical perturbations
   such as damage and strain. Recently, considerable research effort has
   been dedicated to understanding the effect of strain on nanocomposite
   conductivity. However, from a SHM perspective, it is more desirable to
   know the strain state giving rise to an observed conductivity change.
   Therefore, we herein develop an inverse relation for nanocomposite
   piezoresistivity. That is, given a conductivity change, we seek to
   determine the underlying strain state of the nanocomposite. This is done
   by formulating an inverse problem wherein we seek the strain state that
   minimizes the difference between the observed conductivity and the
   conductivity predicted by a piezoresistivity model. This approach is
   verified through simulations by making use of a piezoresistivity model
   published in the literature. Our results show that strains can indeed be
   reconstructed from known conductivity changes. When coupled with
   conductivity-based SHM such as electrical impedance tomography, these
   results have the potential to provide unprecedented insight into the
   mechanical response of nanofiller-modified materials and structures.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-phase (DP) steels offer an outstanding combination of strength and
   formability as a result of their microstructure, in which a hard
   martensitic or bainitic phase is dispersed in a soft ferritic matrix. DP
   steels have a high ultimate tensile strength combined with a low initial
   yielding stress. The yield strength of DP steels is further increased by
   the paint baking, also called bake hardening (BH), process. In the
   current research, the effect of BH parameters, namely pre-strain, baking
   temperature, and holding time, on yield strength increment of DP steels
   with different martensite volume fractions is investigated. DP steels
   with 20 and 30\% martensite volume fraction are pre-strained up to 5\%,
   then they are baked at 100, 170, and 300 degrees C for various times.
   The results show that maximum yield strength is obtained as optimum
   values of BH parameters are applied. It is also found that at high
   values of baking temperature and holding time, martensite tempering
   effects prevail and yield strength increment decreases. The results also
   indicate that the increment of pre-strain enhances the Luders band and
   decreases the yield strength increment.}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbine upscaling is motivated by the fact that larger machines can
   achieve lower levelized cost of energy. However, there are several
   fundamental issues with the design of such turbines, and there is little
   public data available for large wind turbine studies. To address this
   need, we develop a 20 MW common research wind turbine design that is
   available to the public. Multidisciplinary design optimization is used
   to define the aeroservoelastic design of the rotor and tower subject to
   the following constraints: blade-tower clearance, structural stresses,
   modal frequencies, tip-speed and fatigue damage at several sections of
   the tower and blade. For the blade, the design variables include blade
   length, twist and chord distribution, structural thicknesses
   distribution and rotor speed at the rated. The tower design variables
   are the height, and the diameter distribution in the vertical direction.
   For the other components, mass models are employed to capture their
   dynamic interactions. The associated cost of these components is
   obtained by using cost models. The design objective is to minimize the
   levelized cost of energy. The results of this research show the
   feasibility of a 20 MW wind turbine and provide a model with the
   corresponding data for wind energy researchers to use in the
   investigation of different aspects of wind turbine design and upscaling.

Abstract = {{Islet transplantation is a potential cure for diabetic patients, however
   this procedure is not widely adopted due to the high rate of graft
   failure. Islet encapsulation within hydrogels is employed to provide a
   three-dimensional microenvironment conducive to survival of transplanted
   islets to extend graft function. Herein, we present a novel
   macroencapsulation device, composed of PEG hydrogel, that combines
   encapsulation with lithography techniques to generate
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molds. PEG solutions are mixed with islets,
   which are then cast into PDMS molds for subsequent crosslinking. The
   molds can also be employed to provide complex architectures, such as
   microchannels that may allow vascular ingrowth through pre-defined
   regions of the hydrogel. PDMS molds allowed for the formation of stable
   gels with encapsulation of islets, and in complex architectures.
   Hydrogel devices with a thickness of 600mm containing 500 islets
   promoted normoglycemia within 12 days following transplantation into the
   epididymal fat pad, which was sustained over the two-month period of
   study until removal of the device. The inclusion of microchannels, which
   had a similar minimum distance between islets and the hydrogel surface,
   similarly promoted normoglycemia. A glucose challenge test indicated
   hydrogel devices achieved normoglycemia 90 min post-dextrose injections,
   similar to control mice with native pancreata. Histochemical staining
   revealed that transplanted islets, identified as insulin positive, were
   viable and isolated from host tissue at 8 weeks post-transplantation,
   yet devices with microchannels had tissue and vascular ingrowth within
   the channels. Taken together, these results demonstrate a system for
   creating non-degradable hydrogels with complex geometries for
   encapsulating islets capable of restoring normoglycemia, which may
   expand islet transplantation as a treatment option for diabetic
   patients. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Alterations of RNA sequences and structures, such as those from editing
   and alternative splicing, result in two or more RNA transcripts from a
   DNA template. It was thought that in yeast, RNA editing only occurs in
   tRNAs. Here, we found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae have all 12 types of
   RNA-DNA sequence differences (RDDs) in the mRNA. We showed these
   sequence differences are propagated to proteins, as we identified
   peptides encoded by the RNA sequences in addition to those by the DNA
   sequences at RDD sites. RDDs are significantly enriched at regions with
   R-loops. A screen of yeast mutants showed that RDD formation is affected
   by mutations in genes regulating R-loops. Loss-of-function mutations in
   ribonuclease H, senataxin, and topoisomerase I that resolve RNA-DNA
   hybrids lead to increases in RDD frequency. Our results demonstrate that
   RDD is a conserved process that diversifies transcriptomes and proteomes
   and provide a mechanistic link between R-loops and RDDs.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer matrices with excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability
   and other features are highly demanded for the effective utilization
   within nanocomposites. Here, we fabricate free-standing aramid nanofiber
   films via spin coating of an aramid nanofiber/dimethyl sulfoxide
   solution. Compared with traditional film fabrication methods, this
   process is time-saving and also able to easily tune the thickness of the
   films. The resultant films show greatly improved stretchability than
   that of Kevlar threads and relatively high mechanical strength.
   Typically, these films with a thickness of 5.5 A mu m show an ultimate
   strength of 182 MPa with an ultimate tensile strain of 10.5\%. We also
   apply a finite element modeling to simulate the strain and strength
   distributions of the films under uniaxial tension, and the results of
   the simulation are in accordance with the experimental data.
   Furthermore, the aramid nanofiber films exhibit outstanding
   thermostability (decomposition at similar to 550 A degrees C under N-2
   atmosphere and similar to 500 A degrees C in air) and chemical
   inertness, which would endure acid and alkali. The simple method
   demonstrated here provides an important way to prepare high-performance
   aramid nanofiber films for designing new composite systems.}},

Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{13585-13611}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a statistical steganalysis framework to attack
   quantization index modulation (QIM) based steganography. The
   quantization process is generally modeled as an additive noise channel.
   The proposed method exploits the fact that plainquantization
   (quantization without message embedding) decreases local-randomness (or
   increases local-correlation) in the resulting quantized image. Moreover,
   QIM-stego image exhibits relatively higher level of local-randomness
   than the corresponding quantized-cover, though both are obtained using
   same set of parameters. The local-randomness (or interblock correlation)
   of the test-image is used to capture traces left behind by quantization.
   A parametric model is developed to characterize channel-dependent
   local-randomness. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework is used
   to estimate parameters of the distribution of local-randomness mask.
   Distributions of parameters, estimated from the quantized-cover and the
   QIM-stego images, are used to characterize quantization with and without
   message embedding. To investigate variations in the estimated parameters
   as a function of frequency, inter-(variations within each channel(or
   subband)) and intra-channel (across all channels), joint-channel
   modeling and single-channel modeling, respectively, is considered. For
   each approach, a set of parametric detectors based on generalized
   likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is used to distinguish between the
   cover-and the stego-images. To improve detection accuracy, decisions
   from both detectors are fused to generate the final stego-detection
   decision. Effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated using a
   dataset consisting of over 35000 test-images obtained from 880
   uncompressed natural images. Experimental results show that the proposed
   scheme can successfully detect QIMstego images with very low false
   rates. In addition, performance comparison with existing
   state-of-the-art also shows that the proposed method performs
   significantly superior than the selected methods.}},

Abstract = {{The progression of a disease may be affected by many risk factors, such
   as gender, age, and current disease state. Such information is collected
   and made publically available by published clinical studies, yet
   combining this information into a disease model remains a challenge.
   This paper extends the previously published maximum likelihood
   estimation technique to estimate model parameters from indirect
   secondary data. Such information is available in the scientific
   literature so the modeler can access more data when estimating model
   parameters. The extension to the estimation procedure allows model
   transitions that depend on different sets of covariates for which
   secondary data are available. This extension uses a Markov model with
   transition probabilities stored in multi-dimensional tables accessed by
   covariate values. The paper uses a set of cases, including a case of
   cardiovascular disease in diabetes. The cases demonstrate the proposed
   method with various model variations. To help cope with model
   multiplicity, a selection method is demonstrated for picking a preferred
   model according to likelihood and structure criteria.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{189-199}},

Abstract = {{Operation at low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (<1 mg/L) in
   wastewater treatment could save utilities significantly by reducing
   aeration energy costs. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of
   low DO on pharmaceutical biotransformations during treatment. DO
   concentration can impact pharmaceutical biotransformation rates during
   wastewater treatment both directly and indirectly: directly by acting as
   a limiting substrate that slows the activity of the microorganisms
   involved in biotransformation; and indirectly by shaping the microbial
   community and selecting for a community that performs pharmaceutical
   biotransformation faster (or slower). In this study, nitrifying
   bioreactors were operated at low (similar to 0.3 mg/L) and high (>4
   mg/L) DO concentrations to understand how DO growth conditions impacted
   microbial community structure. Short-term batch experiments using the
   biomass from the parent reactors were performed under low and high DO
   conditions to understand how DO concentration impacts microbial
   physiology. Although the low DO parent biomass had a lower specific
   activity with respect to ammonia oxidation than the high DO parent
   reactor biomass, it had faster biotransformation rates of ibuprofen,
   sulfamethoxazole, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, acetaminophen, and atenolol
   in high DO batch conditions. This was likely because the low DO reactor
   had a 2x higher biomass concentration, was enriched for ammonia
   oxidizers (4x higher concentration), and harbored a more diverse
   microbial community (3x more unique taxa) as compared to the high DO
   parent reactor. Overall, the results show that there can be indirect
   benefits from low DO operation over high DO operation that support
   pharmaceutical biotransformation during wastewater treatment. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Goal: We extend a classic signal processing algorithm, the lock-in
   amplifier, to two dimensions to extract the signal in patterned images.
   Methods: The algorithm was evaluated using simulated image data and
   experimental microscopy images to determine the fluorescence signal of
   fluorescently labeled proteins adsorbed on surfaces patterned with
   chemical vapor deposition. Results: The algorithm was capable of
   retrieving the signal with a signal-to-noise ratio as low as -20 dB.
   Optimal parameters were determined for the pattern design. Conclusion:
   The lock-in algorithm is a powerful technique for 1/f noise removal.
   Significance: The methodology holds promise not only for the measurement
   of adsorption events on patterned surfaces but in all situations where a
   signal has to be extracted from a noisy background in two or more
   dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a safety-based route planner that exploits
   vehicle-to-cloud-to-vehicle (V2C2V) connectivity. Time and road risk
   index (RRI) are considered as metrics to be balanced based on user
   preference. To evaluate road segment risk, a road and accident database
   from the highway safety information system is mined with a hybrid neural
   network model to predict RRI. Real-time factors such as time of day, day
   of the week, and weather are included as correction factors to the
   static RRI prediction. With real-time RRI and expected travel time,
   route planning is formulated as a multiobjective network flow problem
   and further reduced to a mixed-integer programming problem. A V2C2V
   implementation of our safety-based route planning approach is proposed
   to facilitate access to real-time information and computing resources. A
   real-world case study, route planning through the city of Columbus,
   Ohio, is presented. Several scenarios illustrate how the ``best{''}
   route can be adjusted to favor time versus safety metrics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of bilevel image similarity, including new
   objective metrics intended to quantify similarity consistent with human
   perception, and a subjective experiment to obtain ground truth for
   judging the performance of the objective similarity metrics. The focus
   is on scenic bilevel images, which are complex, natural or hand-drawn
   images, such as landscapes or portraits. The ground truth was obtained
   from ratings by 77 subjects of 44 distorted versions of seven scenic
   images, using a modified version of the SDSCE testing methodology. Based
   on hypotheses about human perception of bilevel images, several new
   metrics are proposed that outperform existing ones in the sense of
   attaining significantly higher Pearson and Spearman-rank correlation
   coefficients with respect to the ground truth from the subjective
   experiment. The new metrics include adjusted percentage error, bilevel
   local direction, and connected components comparison. Combinations of
   these metrics are also proposed, which exploit their complementarity to
   attain even better performance. These metrics and the ground truth are
   then used to assess the relative severity of various kinds of distortion
   and the performance of several lossy bilevel compression methods.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the problem of reliable decentralized fault prognosis of

   available to the coordinator due to possible failures or communication
   losses of at most n-k local prognosers. We propose the notion of
   k-reliable decentralized prognoser in order to address this reliability
   issue. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
   k-reliable decentralized prognoser, which predicts faults prior to their
   occurrences, is presented. This condition is termed as k-reliable
   coprognosability. A polynomial-time algorithm for the verification of
   k-reliable coprognosability is presented. We also demonstrate how to
   compute the k-reliable reactive bound prior to any occurrence of faults.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid advancement of sensing and computing technology and the
   wide adoption of mobile computing, the construction industry has faced a
   rise in the amount of information and data generated during the
   lifecycle of the construction project. To deal with a large variety of
   project data and information to support efficient and effective decision
   making, visualization, information modeling, and simulation (VIMS) has
   become critical in the development of capital facilities and
   infrastructures. The objective of this paper is to identify and
   investigate grand challenges in VIMS for the construction industry, to
   assist the academic and industry communities in establishing a future
   research agenda to solve VIMS challenges. In particular, 17 VIMS grand
   challenges were identified by an expert task force in the VIMS committee
   of the ASCE Computing and Information Technology Division, and then VIMS
   experts in the civil and construction areas from both academia and
   industry participated in a survey to assess the identified challenges,
   examine the relative importance of the identified challenges, and
   investigate current practices and future directions of VIMS. The survey
   results indicate that several knowledge gaps regarding VIMS challenges
   between academia and industry still exist, and it is the contention of
   this research that these particular gaps need to be addressed in future
   research. These research directions apply to technical issues and
   sociological/cultural/organizational issues in VIMS challenges. The
   major contribution of this paper is its claim that the provision of
   shared views on VIMS challenges lays a firm foundation in which
   collaborative actions between academia and industry can take place,
   which will, in turn, advance VIMS for the construction industry. By
   incorporating the whole project lifecycle, not only project execution
   but also planning, operation, and maintenance, the analysis provides
   meaningful hints for VIMS challenges in architecture, engineering, and
   facility management industries.}},

Abstract = {{The buildings sector accounts for nearly 41\% of the United States'
   primary energy usage. Various lifecycle analysis (LCA)-based tools are
   available for facilitating sustainable material selection and energy
   usage estimation, especially during the material production and
   construction phases of a building. However, for the use and maintenance
   phase, there is a lack of a comprehensive framework that can monitor and
   quantify the effects of various factors such as building system and
   material deterioration and dynamic occupant behavior patterns on the
   energy consumption. This research propose a lifecycle energy monitoring
   framework that couples LCA and energy simulation analysis using a system
   dynamics modeling framework to enable a distributed simulation platform
   that can monitor and control the energy requirements during all phases
   of a building's lifecycle. Experimental results indicate that the
   proposed framework can help understand the optimal maintenance and
   replacement period of major building materials, thereby providing
   options for limiting the overall energy usage and environmental impacts
   from a building during its entire lifecycle.}},

Abstract = {{The use of computational geometry methods for determining soil roundness

   distributions of particle roundness and sphericity were presented for
   three soils with vastly different particle shapes. Values of R and S
   obtained from images of three-dimensional assemblies were almost
   indistinguishable from values obtained using images of detached
   particles showing their largest projected areas. Mean R values were also

Title = {{Simulation-Based Assessment of Workers' Muscle Fatigue and Its Impact on
   Construction Operations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Construction workers are frequently exposed to excessive physical
   demands due to repetitive lifting and material handling while performing
   tasks. Consequently, many construction workers suffer from a significant
   level of muscle fatigue that may negatively impact a project's
   performance. Thus, evaluating the level of muscle fatigue prior to work
   and implementing appropriate interventions to reduce physical demands
   will help to prevent adverse effects of workers' fatigue on construction
   operations. Even though several research efforts have suggested
   methodologies to evaluate muscle fatigue, the extent to which workers'
   muscle fatigue would affect construction performance has not yet been
   fully studied. To address this issue, a simulation-based framework is
   proposed to estimate physical demands and corresponding muscle fatigue,
   and thus to quantitatively evaluate the impact of muscle fatigue during
   construction operations. Specifically, physical demands from a planned
   operation modeled using discrete event simulation (DES) are estimated
   through biomechanical analyses. Then, the proposed dynamic fatigue
   models estimate the level of muscle fatigue of each worker as a function
   of the estimated physical demands. Workers' strategies to mitigate
   muscle fatigue, such as taking voluntary rests, are, in turn, modeled in
   the DES to understand how muscle fatigue affects time and cost
   performance of the planned operation. As a proof of concept, a case
   study on masonry work was performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the
   proposed framework, describing the need for taking into account muscle
   fatigue for operational planning due to possible excessive physical
   demands. The results from the case study indicate that excessive
   physical demands beyond workers' capabilities result in reduction of
   time and cost performance. The proposed framework helps to better
   understand workers' response to physical demands by adding workers'
   capabilities as changing variables into traditional DES approaches,
   enabling pro-active management of human resources. Ultimately, the
   framework, which combines conventional interests on optimized operations
   in terms of time and cost with those of ergonomics, provides
   opportunities to take into account both workers' health and work
   performance in early design stages.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Indirect methods used for solving optimal-control problems, when
   combined with proper initialization and homotopy approaches, remain
   attractive for space trajectory optimization, as they are able to
   achieve fast convergence to a solution of the necessary conditions. In
   this paper, the extended logarithmic-smoothing technique is revisited
   and integrated with an indirect method to efficiently generate
   minimum-fuel time-fixed low-thrust rendezvous trajectories. This
   approach is considered for three cases, in which equations of motion are
   expressed in terms of Cartesian, spherical, and modified equinoctial
   coordinates. In addition, the paper addresses the calculation of the
   Jacobian matrix of the constraints via an implementation of the
   state-transition-matrix approach, which avoids the discontinuities of
   the control along the trajectory. The application of the method to two
   interplanetary missions from Earth to Mars and to asteroid Dionysus is
   demonstrated. It is shown that, by exploiting the state transition
   matrix and the homotopy method, the optimal-control problem becomes

Title = {{Understanding Dispute Resolution in the Middle East Region from
   Perspectives of Different Stakeholders}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The construction industry in the Middle East (ME) is witnessing
   continuous growth that attracts international contractors and investors
   to its large-scale projects. However, this growth is accompanied by an
   inevitable increase in claims and disputes, which consequently leads to
   significant delays and additional costs to the project. Alternative
   dispute resolution (ADR) methods are often used to address these
   conflicts, but different issues and backgrounds of stakeholders in the
   ME affect which ADR is used if any. In light of this, the main aim of
   this study is to explore dispute causes and resolution practices in the
   ME as perceived by the different stakeholders involved. Based on
   extensive literature review, a comprehensive questionnaire survey was
   conducted involving 177 professionals from different sectors of the ME
   construction industry. The responses were analyzed from three distinct
   perspectives, namely contractors, owners, and claim advisors. Findings
   revealed that contractual causes are the most common disputes in the ME
   region, and traditional resolution methods are continually practiced
   despite the recognized need for new alternatives. This research provides
   professionals in Middle Eastern and foreign countries with invaluable
   insights into construction claims' types and dispute resolution (DR)
   systems in the region. Moreover, it allows the various construction
   stakeholders to understand and take into consideration the perceptions
   of others when applying risk and dispute prevention techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a thermodynamics-based mean-value engine model that
   predicts the temperature and pressure at the end of each discrete
   combustion phase, the peak temperature and pressure, and the indicated
   mean effective pressure. The model has sensitivities to the engine
   speed, the main and pilot injection quantities and timings, and the
   temperature and pressure conditions in the intake and exhaust manifolds.
   Mathematical relationships are established between the input variables
   and the output variables through the thermodynamic principles of the
   modified ideal-gas-limited pressure cycle. Modifications to the
   ideal-gas cycle include the pilot combustion stage, the effective
   compression ratio based on the fuel injection timing and start of
   combustion, the effect of the constant-volume burn ratio on combustion,
   and the exhaust valve opening timing. The model is also augmented with
   empirical correlations for the ignition delay, the constant-volume burn
   ratio, and the heat transfer in order to improve the fidelity of the
   model. It is validated using test data from a Ford 6.7 l diesel engine.
   Unlike most data-regression-based mean-value engine models, the model
   presented in this paper does not sacrifice essential details of the
   underlying physics while providing a computationally efficient
   simulation tool.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the analytical modeling of orthogonal spiral
   structures (OSS), a promising option for small-scale energy harvesting
   applications. This unique multi-beam structure is analyzed using a
   distributed parameter approach with Euler-Bernoulli assumptions. First,
   an aluminum substrate is evaluated to determine if the proposed design
   can be used to capture vibration energy in the desired frequency range
   using a twelve beam OSS. Finite element calculations are used to
   validate the analytical model. This model is then modified to include
   the electromechanical effects of a piezoelectric layer added to the
   aluminum substrate. Lastly, the effects of the beam width and the number
   of beams is analyzed for a particular surface area of the OSS. Results
   show that increasing the number of beams causes a reduction in the first
   natural frequency. From those results, it is possible to conclude that
   OSS can be used as an alternative to current energy harvesting systems
   for MEMS applications, allowing the capture of environmental energy in
   the frequency range of common mechanical systems.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular-targeted nanocarriers are an attractive option for the
   treatment of a number of cardiovascular diseases, as they allow for more
   specific delivery and increased efficacy of many small molecule drugs.
   However, immune clearance, limited cellular uptake, and particle-cell
   dynamics in blood flow can hinder nanocarrier efficacy in many
   applications. This review aims to investigate successful strategies for
   the use of vascular-targeted nanocarriers in the treatment of
   cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. In particular, the
   review will highlight strategies employed for actively targeting the
   components of the atherosclerotic plaque, including endothelial cells,
   macrophages, and platelets and passive targeting via endothelial
   permeability, as well as design specifications (such as size, shape, and
   density) aimed at enhancing the ability of nanocarriers to reach the

Abstract = {{Precipitate free zones (PFZs) are commonly believed to be controlled by

   the PFZ around primary carbides (Nb, Ti)C is also influenced by stress
   field in alloy 725, which is a nickel base alloy hardened by gamma{''}
   precipitates. Finite element simulation suggests that the interaction
   energy between the local stress induced by primary carbides and the
   transformation strain of gamma{''} cause a bias in their nucleation.
   These observations show that in addition to diffusion, internal stress
   can significantly influence the nucleation of precipitates around sinks.

Abstract = {{The phase equilibria between thermal barrier coating (TBC) materials and
   calcium magnesium-aluminosilicate melts (CMAS, representing deposits
   formed when siliceous debris is ingested into modern turbine engines),

   the influence of the deposit and thermal barrier oxide compositions on
   the melt solubility limits and reaction product constitution. Model
   deposit compositions with SiO2 to CaO ratios from 1.4 to 4.7 and with or
   without MgO were reacted with yttria- and gadolinia-zirconia thermal
   barrier oxides ranging from pure ZrO2 to the pure yttria and gadolinia.
   The reactions formed various crystalline silicate phases; rare
   earth-calcium-silicate apatite and zircon (ZrSiO4) were observed most
   frequently. Following the reactions, the residual melts were depleted in
   SiO2 and generally enriched in CaO, MgO, and Al2O3. The implications of
   the anticipated changes in the melt viscosity and the cation
   partitioning between the melt and various solid solution phases on the
   efficacy of degradation-mitigating crystallization reactions are
   discussed. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The increasing demand for cleaner combustion and reduced greenhouse gas
   emissions motivates research on the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels and
   their surrogates. Accurate detailed chemical kinetic models are an
   important prerequisite for high fidelity reacting flow simulations
   capable of improving combustor design and operation. The development of
   such models for many new fuel components and/or surrogate molecules is
   greatly facilitated by the application of reaction classes and rate
   rules. Accurate and versatile rate rules are desirable to improve the
   predictive accuracy of kinetic models. A major contribution in the
   literature is the recent work by Bugler et al. (2015), which has
   significantly improved rate rules and thermochemical parameters used in
   kinetic modeling of alkanes. In the present study, it is demonstrated
   that rate rules can be used and consistently optimized for a set of
   normal alkanes including n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, and
   n-undecane, thereby improving the predictive accuracy for all the
   considered fuels. A Bayesian framework is applied in the calibration of
   the rate rules. The optimized rate rules are subsequently applied to
   generate a mechanism for n-dodecane, which was not part of the training
   set for the optimized rate rules. The developed mechanism shows accurate
   predictions compared with published well-validated mechanisms for a wide
   range of conditions. (C) 2016 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{The challenge to mitigate real-world emissions from vehicles calls for
   powerful in-use compliance supervision. The remote on-board diagnostic
   (OBD) approach, with wireless data communications, is one of the
   promising next-generation monitoring methods. We collected
   second-by-second profiles of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxides
   (NOX) emissions, driving conditions and engine performance for three
   conventional diesel and three hybrid diesel buses participating in a
   remote OBD pilot program in Nanjing, China. Our results showed that the
   average CO2 emissions for conventional diesel and hybrid diesel buses
   were 816 83 g km(-1) and 627 54 g km(-1), respectively, under a typical
   driving pattern. An operating mode binning analysis indicated that CO2
   emissions reduction by series-parallel hybrid technology was largely
   because of the significant benefits of the technology under the modes of
   low speed and low power demand. However, significantly higher CO2
   emissions were observed for conventional diesel buses during rush hours,
   higher than 1200 g km(-1). The OBD data suggested no improvement in NOX
   emission reduction for hybrid buses compared with conventional buses;
   both were approximately 12 g km(-1) because of poor performance of the
   selective catalyst reduction (SCR) systems in the real world.
   Speed-dependent functions for real-world CO2 and NOX emissions were also
   constructed. The CO2 emissions of hybrid buses were much less sensitive
   to the average speed than conventional buses. If the average speed
   decreased from 20 km h(-1) to 10 km h(-1), the estimated CO2 emission
   factor for conventional buses would be increased by 34\%. Such a change
   in speed would increase NOX emissions for conventional and hybrid buses
   by 38\% and 56\%, respectively. This paper demonstrates the useful
   features of the remote OBD system and can inform policy makers how to
   take advantage of these features in monitoring in-use vehicles. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Through-the-wall radar imaging systems are utilized for mapping
   buildings' interiors and detecting static and moving objects hidden
   behind the walls. The current techniques rely on large linear antenna
   arrays with directional radiation pattern for obtaining high cross-range
   resolution, and their imaging capability is limited by the low array
   processing gain and field of view. This paper introduces a new technique
   for through-the-wall radar imaging in which the linear array is replaced
   by a dense 2-D synthetic array formed by an ad hoc network of moving
   transceivers with omnidirectional antennas. Applying this method enables
   imaging of building interiors from outside or inside with 360. field of
   view. As receivers move, the direct and reflected signals from a
   stationary transmitter are sampled at different positions within the
   roaming domain, and by combining such signal samples using an
   appropriate beam-forming technique, a large and dense array is
   synthesized to provide an accurate radar map of the buildings' interiors
   and hidden objects in all directions. To increase the system dynamic
   range, the direct signals between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx)
   antennas are reduced, utilizing orthogonal polarizations for Tx and Rx.
   To improve the range resolution and reduce the background noise, a new
   method based on the generalized pencil of function method is proposed.
   This method can accurately detect the locations of the reflecting points
   within the image which, in combination with the standard back-projection
   focusing, provides high-quality radar images. A finite-element method
   for a simple building structure and ray tracing for a large 3-D building
   structure are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the diverse traffic demands of different applications, emerging
   WLAN standards have been incorporating a variety of channel widths
   ranging from 5 to 160 MHz. The coexistence of variable-width channels
   imposes a new challenge to the 802.11 protocols, since the 802.11 MAC is
   agnostic of, and thus incapable of, adapting to the PHY-layer spectrum
   heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we uncover the cause and
   effect of variable-width channel coexistence, and develop a MAC-layer
   scheme, called Fine-grained Spectrum Sharing (FSS), that solves the
   general problem of fair and efficient spectrum sharing among users with
   heterogeneous channel-widths. Instead of deeming its spectrum band as an
   atomic block, an FSS user divides the spectrum into chunks, and adapts
   its chunk usage on a per-packet basis. FSS's spectrum adaptation is
   driven by a decentralized optimization framework. It preserves the
   802.11 CSMA/CA primitives while allowing users to contend for each
   spectrum chunk, and can opportunistically split a wide-band channel or
   bond multiple (discontiguous) chunks to ensure fair and efficient access
   to available spectrum. In making such adaptation decisions, it balances
   the benefit from discontiguous chunks and the cost of guardband - a
   unique tradeoff in WLANs with heterogeneous channel-widths. Our in-depth
   evaluation demonstrates that FSS can improve throughput by multiple
   folds, while maintaining fairness of spectrum sharing for heterogeneous
   WLANs.}},

Title = {{Effect of the Maximum Dose on White Matter Fiber Bundles Using

Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Previous efforts to decrease neurocognitive effects of
   radiation focused on sparing isolated cortical structures. We
   hypothesize that understanding temporal, spatial, and dosimetric
   patterns of radiation damage to whole-brain white matter (WM) after
   partial-brain irradiation might also be important. Therefore, we carried
   out a study to develop the methodology to assess radiation therapy
   (RT)-induced damage to whole-brain WM bundles.
   Methods and Materials: An atlas-based, automated WM tractography
   analysis was implemented to quantify longitudinal changes in indices of
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 major WM fibers in 33 patients with
   predominantly low-grade or benign brain tumors treated by RT. Six DTI
   scans per patient were performed from before RT to 18 months after RT.
   The DTI indices and planned doses (maximum and mean doses) were mapped
   onto profiles of each of 22 WM bundles. A multivariate linear regression
   was performed to determine the main dose effect as well as the influence
   of other clinical factors on longitudinal percentage changes in axial
   diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) from before RT.
   Results: Among 22 fiber bundles, AD or RD changes in 12 bundles were
   affected significantly by doses (P<.05), as the effect was progressive
   over time. In 9 elongated tracts, decreased AD or RD was significantly
   related to maximum doses received, consistent with a serial structure.
   In individual bundles, AD changes were up to 11.5\% at the maximum dose
   locations 18 months after RT. The dose effect on WM was greater in older
   female patients than younger male patients.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates for the first time that the maximum
   dose to the elongated WM bundles causes post-RT damage in WM. Validation
   and correlative studies are necessary to determine the ability and
   impact of sparing these bundles on preserving neurocognitive function
   after RT. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Grid-to-rod fretting (GTRF) wear is a major cause of fuel leaks.
   Understanding its mechanism is crucial for improving the reliability of
   nuclear reactors. In this paper we present a three-dimensional,
   finite-element based approach, which reveals how the wear rate depends
   on the size of the gap between the grid and the fuel rod, and on the
   frequency of the excitation force. We show that these two factors affect
   the dynamic vibration of the rod, which leads to three different
   regimes: harmonic, period-doubling and chaotic. The wear rate in the
   harmonic regime is significantly larger than that in the other two
   regimes, and reaches a maximum when the excitation frequency is close to
   the resonant frequency of the system, which is dependent on the gap
   size. We introduce the concept of a critical gap size that gives the
   maximum wear rate, and we identify the properties and values of this
   critical gap size. A wear map is developed as a result of a large number
   of parametric studies. This map shows quantitatively the wear rate as a
   function of the gap size and excitation frequency, and will be a
   valuable tool for the design and optimization of the fuel assembly to
   reduce the risk of fuel leaks caused by GTRF. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{With increasing concerns regarding occupational safety and health,
   managing excessive physical workloads of workers is critical to prevent
   workers' fatigue, injuries, errors, or accidents at physically demanding
   workplaces such as construction. In this regard, heart rate (HR) is an
   effective physiological indicator of workers' physical demands.
   Currently, off-the-shelf wearable activity trackers (e.g.,
   wristband-type) can monitor a worker's HR with its embedded
   photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor. However, PPG signals can be highly
   affected by signal noises resulted from user's movements, and thus the
   exact HR extraction from a wristband-type PPG may not be sufficiently
   accurate during intensive construction tasks. In this paper, we
   investigate the accuracy of a PPG sensor embedded in a wristband-type
   tracker to see if it can be used for construction. Through field data
   collection from seven construction workers, we conduct a comparative HR
   analysis between a PPG sensor and an electro-cardiography (ECG) sensor
   in a chest strap used as ground truth. The results show that a PPG-based
   HR sensor in a wristband-type activity tracker has a potential for
   practicable HR monitoring of construction workers with 4.79\% of
   mean-average-percentage-error (MAPE) and 0.85 of correlation coefficient
   for whole datasets (4.44\%, 4.52\%, and 533\% of MAPEs and 0.89, 0.70,
   and 0.61 of correlation coefficients during light works with <90 bpm of
   HRs, moderate works with 90-110 bpm of HRs, and heavy works with >110
   bpm of HRs, respectively). Because there is still room for improvement
   of the accuracy, particularly during heavy works, we also investigate
   the factors affecting the accuracy of HR monitoring using inequality
   statistics. From this secondary investigation, we found the major
   sources of error including noises from motion artifacts. With advanced
   noise-cancellation techniques, it is expected that that field HR
   monitoring using wearable activity trackers can be used to evaluate
   worker's physical demands from diverse construction tasks in a
   non-intrusive and affordable way. As a result, our work will help manage
   excessive workloads (e.g., flexing work/rest plans) so that a worker can
   sustain his/her given tasks during working time in a safer and healthier
   way. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   resistant alloy, and 0.007\%/ dpa in T91. In T91, resistance was due to
   suppression of void nucleation. Swelling resistance was greatest in T92,
   with a low density (similar to 1 x 10(20) m(-3)) of small voids that had
   not grown appreciably, indicating suppression of nucleation and growth.
   Additional heats of T91 indicated that alloy composition was not the
   determining factor of swelling resistance. Carbon and chromium-rich M2X
   precipitates formed at 250 dpa and were correlated with decreased
   nucleation in T91 and T92, but did not affect void growth in HT9.
   Dislocation and G-phase microstructure evolution was analyzed up to 650
   dpa in HT9. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the following two deterministic inventory optimization
   problems with non-stationary demands. Submodular joint replenishment
   problem. This involves multiple item types and a single retailer who
   faces demands over a finite planning horizon of T periods. In each time
   period, any subset of item-types can be ordered incurring a joint
   ordering cost which is submodular. Moreover, items can be held in
   inventory while incurring a holding cost. The objective is to find a
   sequence of orders that satisfies all demands and minimizes the total
   ordering and holding costs. Inventory routing problem. This involves a
   single depot that stocks items, and multiple retailer locations facing
   demands over a finite planning horizon of T periods. In each time
   period, any subset of locations can be visited using a vehicle
   originating from the depot. There is also cost incurred for holding
   items at any retailer. The objective here is to satisfy all demands
   while minimizing the sum of routing and holding costs. We present a
   unified approach that yields -factor approximation algorithms for both
   problems when the holding costs are polynomial functions. A special case
   is the classic linear holding cost model, wherein this is the first
   sub-logarithmic approximation ratio for either problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the level of model fidelity needed in order for
   a model predictive control (MPC)-based obstacle avoidance algorithm to
   be able to safely and quickly avoid obstacles even when the vehicle is
   close to its dynamic limits. The context of this work is large
   autonomous ground vehicles that manoeuvre at high speed within unknown,
   unstructured, flat environments and have significant vehicle
   dynamics-related constraints. Five different representations of vehicle
   dynamics models are considered: four variations of the two
   degrees-of-freedom (DoF) representation as lower fidelity models and a
   fourteen DoF representation with combined-slip Magic Formula tyre model
   as a higher fidelity model. It is concluded that the two DoF
   representation that accounts for tyre nonlinearities and longitudinal
   load transfer is necessary for the MPC-based obstacle avoidance
   algorithm in order to operate the vehicle at its limits within an
   environment that includes large obstacles. For less challenging
   environments, however, the two DoF representation with linear tyre model
   and constant axle loads is sufficient.}},

Abstract = {{The classification between a sequence of highly variable combustion
   events that have an underlying deterministic pattern and a sequence of
   combustion events with similar level of variability but random
   characteristics is important for control of combustion phasing. In the
   case of high cyclic variation (CV) with underlying deterministic
   patterns, it is possible to apply closed-loop combustion control on a
   cyclic-basis with a fixed mean value, such as injection timing in
   homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) or spark timing in spark
   ignition (SI) applications, to contract the CV. In the case of a random
   distribution, the high CV can be avoided by shifting operating
   conditions away from the unstable region via advancing or retarding the
   injection timing or the spark timing in the mean-sense. Therefore, the
   focus of this paper is on the various methods of computing CA50 for
   analyzing and classifying cycle-to-cycle variability. The assumptions
   made to establish fast and possibly online methods can alter the
   distribution of the calculated parameters from cycle-to-cycle, possibly
   leading to incorrect pattern interpretation and improper control action.
   Finally, we apply a statistical technique named ``permutation
   entropy{''} for the first time on classifying combustion patterns in
   HCCI and SI engine for varying operating conditions. Then, the various
   fast methods for computing CA50 feed the two statistical methods,
   permutation and the Shannon entropy, and their differences and
   similarities are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of scrap fluorescent lamps in China has increased greatly
   in recent years, and the improper disposal of mercury-containing waste
   has posed a major risk to residents' health. This paper describes
   research based on a sample from China to investigate the disposal and
   willingness to pay for scrap fluorescent lamps in households. We
   estimated that 4.19 million scrap fluorescent lamps are generated from
   households in Beijing per year. Most residents cannot recycle due to a
   lack of recycling facilities, and 34.7 kg scrap mercury is out of
   control. We found that 68.6\% of Beijing residents are willing to pay
   extra fees to dispose of scrap fluorescent lamps safely, and the average
   value is 1.98 CNY/lamp, which is twice the value of the subsidiary
   standard that the government gives to treatment plants. We found that
   the length of residence period, cognition of hazardous waste and the
   understanding of extended producer responsibility (EPR) are the dominant
   factors that affect residents' payment decisions. Governmental
   departments should consider establishing a special fund to ensure the
   safe disposal of household scrap fluorescent lamps by installing
   recycling facilities in communities and by subsidizing recycling
   enterprises. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a notion of finite abstractions that can be used
   to synthesize robust controllers for dynamical systems from temporal
   logic specifications. These finite abstractions, equipped with certain
   robustness margins, provide a unified approach to various issues
   commonly encountered in implementing control systems, such as inter
   sample behaviors of a sampled-data system, effects of imperfect state
   measurements and unmodeled dynamics. The main results of this paper
   demonstrate that the robustness margins can effectively account for the
   mismatches between a control system and its finite abstractions used for
   control synthesis. The quantitative nature of the robustness margins
   also makes it possible to study the trade-offs between the performance
   of controllers and their robustness against various types of adversaries
   (e.g., delays, measurement errors, or modeling uncertainties). We use a
   simple adaptive cruise control (ACC) example to illustrate such
   robustness-performance trade-offs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present work, a recently developed solid state joining technique,
   Friction self-piercing riveting (F-SPR), has been applied for joining
   high strength aluminum alloy AA7075-T6 to magnesium alloy AZ31B. The
   process was performed on a specially designed machine where the spindle
   can achieve the motion of sudden stop. Effects of rivet rotating rate
   and punch speed on axial plunge force, torque, joint microstructure and
   quality have been analyzed systematically. During F-SPR, higher rotating
   rate and slower punch speed can reduce axial force and torque, which
   correspondingly results in a slightly smaller interlock between rivet
   leg and joined materials. Improved local flowability of both aluminum
   and magnesium alloys under a higher rotating speed results in a thicker
   aluminum layer surrounding the rivet leg, where formation of Al-Mg
   intermetallics was observed. Equivalent joint strength obtained in this
   study are higher than the yield strength of the AZ31 Mg alloy. One of
   the tensile failure modes is the rivet fracture, which is due to local
   softening of rivet leg from frictional heat. Other two failure modes
   include rivet pullout and shear through of bottom sheet. (C) 2016

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{188}},
Pages = {{8-12}},

Abstract = {{Prior published papers has been reanalyzed in this retrospective study
   of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) coerced into forming amyloids through
   assays using both light scattering and Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence.
   The published datasets were extracted and analyzed by a sigmoidal
   time-dependent model, which yields two time constants which allow
   comparison between various concentration levels of protein in solution,
   denaturing temperature, some other additives and the presence of
   mechanical agitation, however that was accomplished. Shorter aggregation
   times are observed with increased protein concentration in solution and
   increased denaturing temperature. The presence of agitation seems to
   have a large influence and future efforts should be clear to identify
   the type of agitation if standards are to be developed. Finally
   comparing scattering and ThT fluorescence, as indicators, it appears
   that scattering occurs at an earlier time point relative to ThT
   fluorescence linked with beta sheet formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We have studied strong exciton-plasmon coupling in the films of Ag
   nanoislands as well as in the layer-by-layer (LBL) deposited films of Au
   nanoparticles (NPs) coated with highly concentrated rhodamine 6G (R6G)
   dye. Their absorbance and the reflectance spectra featured the peaks or
   dips, which were not characteristic of dye or NPs/nanoislands taken
   separately. The positions of the spectral maxima (or minima) in the
   dye-doped films, plotted against those in pristine Ag nanoislands films,
   resulted in the dispersion curves comprised of three branches. They
   could be described by the analytical model based on the Hamiltonian
   accounting for the unperturbed energies of the surface plasmon (SP)
   resonance, the two bands composing the absorption spectrum of R6G dye,
   and the exciton-plasmon coupling energy.. Its value was larger in Ag
   nanoislands films deposited on hyperbolic metamaterials (0.221 eV) than
   on glass (0.165 eV). The minimal gap between the upper and the lower
   branches was equal to approximate to 3 Delta. The dispersion curves in
   the Au NPs LBL films could be described with the Hamiltonian equation at
   relatively small dye concentrations. At larger concentrations of R6G
   molecules, the spectral peaks shifted and became more pronounced. The
   corresponding dispersion curve could not be described in terms of the
   existing model, indicating the need for further theoretical studies. (C)

Abstract = {{The current knowledge concerning mercury dry deposition is reviewed,
   including dry-deposition algorithms used in chemical transport models
   (CTMs) and at monitoring sites and related deposition calculations,
   measurement methods and studies for quantifying dry deposition of
   gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) and particulate bound mercury (PBM), and
   measurement studies of litterfall and throughfall mercury. Measured
   median GOM plus PBM dry deposition in Asia (10.7 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)) is
   almost double that in North America (6.1 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)) due to the
   higher anthropogenic emissions in Asia. The measured mean GOM plus PBM
   dry deposition in Asia (22.7 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)), however, is less than
   that in North America (30.8 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)). The variations between
   the median and mean values reflect the influences that single extreme
   measurements can have on the mean of a data set. Measured median
   litterfall and throughfall mercury are, respectively, 34.8 and 49.0 mu g
   m(-2) yr(-1) in Asia, 12.8 and 16.3 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) in Europe, and
   11.9 and 7.0 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) in North America. The corresponding
   measured mean litterfall and throughfall mercury are, respectively, 42.8
   and 43.5 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) in Asia, 14.2 and 19.0 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) in
   Europe, and 12.9 and 9.3 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) in North America. The much
   higher litterfall mercury than GOM plus PBM dry deposition suggests the
   important contribution of gaseous elemental mercy (GEM) to mercury dry
   deposition to vegetated canopies. Over all the regions, including the
   Amazon, dry deposition, estimated as the sum of litterfall and
   throughfall minus open-field wet deposition, is more dominant than wet
   deposition for Hg deposition. Regardless of the measurement or modelling
   method used, a factor of 2 or larger uncertainties in GOM plus PBM dry
   deposition need to be kept in mind when using these numbers for mercury
   impact studies.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{The no-enclave percolation (NEP) model introduced recently by Sheinman
   et al. can be mapped to a problem of holes within a standard percolation
   backbone, and numerical measurements of such holes give the same
   size-distribution exponent tau = 1.82(1) as found for the NEP model. An
   argument is given that t = 1 + d(B)/2 approximate to 1.822 for backbone
   holes, where d(B) is the backbone dimension. On the other hand, a model
   of simple holes within a percolation cluster yields tau = 1 + d(f)/2
   187/96 approximate to 1.948, where d(f) is the fractal dimension of the
   cluster, and this value is consistent with the experimental results of
   gel collapse of Sheinman et al., which give tau = 1.91(6). This suggests
   that the gel clusters are of the universality class of percolation
   cluster holes. Both models give a discontinuous maximum hole size at
   p(c), signifying explosive percolation behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The simultaneous realization of high efficiency, stable spectra, high
   color rendering index (CRI), and low-efficiency roll-off in a
   fluorescent white organic light-emitting diode (WOLED) still remains a
   big challenge. Here, we demonstrate high-performance conventional
   fluorescent-dopant-based WOLEDs by strategic management of singlet and
   triplet excitons within an efficient emissive zone. This design consists
   of two separated red/green sub-EMLs with ultralow doping concentration
   and a sandwiched sub-EML doped with red and green fluorescent dyes at a
   relatively high concentration, which can harness all electrogenerated
   excitons and reduce the energy loss to the utmost extent. Accordingly,
   the resulting WOLED realizes an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of
   18.2\% with a maximum power efficiency of 44.6 lm W-1. At the practical
   luminance of 1000 cd m(-2) for the lighting source, the EQE still
   remains as high as 16.2\% with a CRI of 82 and stable color spectra. A
   comprehensive understanding of the device working mechanism is performed
   to guide design of efficient and stable fluorescent WOLEDs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{42}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Atmospheric pressure plasmas have shown great promise for the treatment
   of wounds and cancerous tumors. In these applications, the sample is
   usually covered by a thin layer of a biological liquid. The reactive
   oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) generated by the plasma activate and
   are processed by the liquid before the plasma produced activation
   reaches the tissue. The synergy between the plasma and the liquid,
   including evaporation and the solvation of ions and neutrals, is
   critical to understanding the outcome of plasma treatment. The
   atmospheric pressure plasma sources used in these procedures are
   typically repetitively pulsed. The processes activated by the plasma
   sources have multiple timescales-from a few ns during the discharge
   pulse to many minutes for reactions in the liquid. In this paper we
   discuss results from a computational investigation of plasma-liquid
   interactions and liquid phase chemistry using a global model with the
   goal of addressing this large dynamic range in timescales. In modeling
   air plasmas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge over liquid
   covered tissue, 5000 voltage pulses were simulated, followed by 5 min of
   afterglow. Due to the accumulation of long-lived species such as ozone
   and NxOy, the gas phase dynamics of the 5000th discharge pulse are
   different from those of the first pulse, particularly with regards to
   the negative ions. The consequences of applied voltage, gas flow, pulse
   repetition frequency, and the presence of organic molecules in the
   liquid on the gas and liquid reactive species are discussed.}},

   introducing generic degree-four vertices}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Origami-based design holds promise for developing new mechanical
   metamaterials whose overall kinematic and mechanical properties can be
   programmed using purely geometric criteria. In this article, we
   demonstrate that the deformation of a generic degree-four vertex (
   4-vertex) origami cell is a combination of contracting, shearing,
   bending, and facet-binding. The last three deformation mechanisms are
   missing in the current rigid-origami metamaterial investigations, which
   focus mainly on conventional Miura-ori patterns. We show that these
   mechanisms provide the 4-vertex origami sheets and blocks with new
   deformation patterns as well as extraordinary kinematical and mechanical
   properties, including self-locking, tridirectional negative Poisson's
   ratios, flipping of stiffness profiles, and emerging shearing stiffness.
   This study reveals that the 4-vertex cells offer a better platform and
   greater design space for developing origami-based mechanical
   metamaterials than the conventional Miura-ori cell.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Using matrix elasticity and cyclic stretch have been investigated for
   inducing mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) differentiation towards the
   smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage but not in combination. We hypothesized
   that combining lineage-specific stiffness with cyclic stretch would
   result in a significantly increased expression of SMC markers, compared
   to non-stretched controls. First, we generated dense collagen type I
   sheets by mechanically compressing collagen hydrogels. Atomic force
   microscopy revealed a nanoscale stiffness range known to support
   myogenic differentiation. Further characterization revealed
   viscoelasticity and stable biomechanical properties under cyclic stretch
   with >99\% viable adherent human MSC. MSCs on collagen sheets
   demonstrated a significantly increased mRNA but not protein expression
   of SMC markers, compared to on culture flasks. However, cyclic stretch
   of MSCs on collagen sheets significantly increased both mRNA and protein
   expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, transgelin, and calponin versus
   plastic and non-stretched sheets. Thus, lineage-specific stiffness and
   cyclic stretch can be applied together for inducing MSC differentiation
   towards SMCs without the addition of recombinant growth factors or other
   soluble factors. This represents a novel stimulation method for
   modulating the phenotype of MSCs towards SMCs that could easily be
   incorporated into currently available methodologies to obtain a more
   targeted control of MSC phenotype.}},

Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{The Interacting Particle Representation Model (IPRM) of homogeneous
   turbulence incorporates information about the morphology of turbulent
   structures within the confines of a one-point model. In the original
   formulation {[}Kassinos and Reynolds, Center for Turbulence Research:
   Annual Research Briefs, 31-51 (1996)], the IPRM was developed in a
   Lagrangian setting by evolving second moments of velocity conditional on
   a given gradient vector. In the presentwork, the IPRMis reformulated in
   an Eulerian framework, and evolution equations are developed for the
   marginal probability density functions (PDFs). Eulerian methods avoid
   the issues associated with statistical estimators used by Lagrangian
   approaches, such as slow convergence. A specific emphasis of this work
   is to use the IPRM to examine the long time evolution of homogeneous
   turbulence. We first describe the derivation of the marginal PDF in
   spherical coordinates, which reduces the number of independent variables
   and the cost associated with Eulerian simulations of PDF models. Next, a
   numerical method based on radial basis functions over a spherical domain
   is adapted to the IPRM. Finally, results obtained with the new Eulerian
   solutionmethod are thoroughly analyzed. The sensitivity of the Eulerian
   simulations to parameters of the numerical scheme, such as the size of
   the time step and the shape parameter of the radial basis functions, is
   examined. A comparison between Eulerian and Lagrangian simulations is
   performed to discern the capabilities of each of the methods. Finally, a
   linear stability analysis based on the eigenvalues of the discrete
   differential operators is carried out for both the new Eulerian solution
   method and the original Lagrangian approach.}},

Abstract = {{Differentiation of solvents having similar physicochemical properties,
   such as ethanol and methanol, is an important issue of interest.
   However, without performing chemical analyses, discrimination between
   methanol and ethanol is highly challenging due to their similarity in
   chemical structure as well as properties. Here, we present a novel type
   of alcohol and water sensor based on the subtle differences in
   interaction among solvent analytes, fluorescent organic molecules, and a
   mesoporous `silica gel substrate. A gradual change in the chemical
   structure of the fluorescent diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives
   alters their interaction with the substrate and solvent analyte, which
   creates a distinct intermolecular aggregation of `the DPP derivatives on
   the silica gel substrate depending on the solvent environment and
   produces a change in the fluorescence color and intensity as a sensory
   signal. The devised sensor device, which is fabricated with simple
   drop-casting of the DPP derivative solutions onto a silica gel
   substrate, exhibited a completely reversible fluorescence signal change
   with large fluorescence signal contrast, which allows selective solvent
   detection by simple optical observation with the naked eye under UV
   light. Superior selectivity of the alcohol and water sensor system,
   which can clearly distinguish among ethanol, methanol,- ethylene glycol,
   and' water, is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of arsenic from drinking water sources produces
   arsenic-bearing wastes, which are disposed of in a variety of ways.
   Several disposal options involve anaerobic environments, including
   mixing arsenic waste with cow dung, landfills, anaerobic digesters, and
   pond sediments. Though poorly understood, the production of gaseous
   arsenic species in these environments can be a primary goal (cow dung
   mixing) or an unintended consequence (anaerobic digesters). Once formed,
   these gaseous arsenic species are readily diluted in the atmosphere.
   Arsenic volatilization can be mediated by the enzyme arsenite
   S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (ArsM) or through the enzymes
   involved in methanogenesis. In this study, methanogenic mesocosms with
   arsenic-bearing ferric iron waste from an electrocoagulation drinking
   water treatment system were used to evaluate the role of methanogenesis
   in arsenic volatilization using methanogen inhibitors. Arsenic
   volatilization was highest in methanogenic mesocosms, but represented
   <0.02\% of the total arsenic added. 16S rRNA cDNA sequencing, qPCR of
   mcrA transcripts, and functional gene array-based analysis of arsM
   expression, revealed that arsenic volatilization correlated with
   methanogenic activity. Aqueous arsenic concentrations increased in all
   mesocosms, indicating that unintended contamination may result from
   disposal in anaerobic environments. This highlights that more research
   is needed before recommending anaerobic disposal intended to promote
   arsenic volatilization.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a fully automated portable 2-dimensional (2-D) gas
   chromatography (GC x GC) device, which had a dimension of 60 cm x 50 cm
   x 10 cm and weight less than 5 kg. The device incorporated a
   micropreconcentrator/injector, commercial columns, micro-Deans switches,
   microthermal injectors, microphotoionization detectors, data acquisition
   cards, and power supplies, as well as computer control and user
   interface. It employed multiple channels (4 channels) in the second
   dimension (D-2) to increase the D-2 separation time (up to 32 s) and
   hence D-2 peak capacity. In addition, a nondestructive flow-through
   vapor detector was installed at the end of the D-1 column to monitor the
   eluent from D-1 and assist in reconstructing D-1 elution peaks. With the
   information obtained jointly from the D-1 and D-2 detectors, D-1 elution
   peaks could be reconstructed with significantly improved D-1 resolution.
   In this Article, we first discuss the details of the system operating
   principle and the algorithm to reconstruct D-1 elution peaks, followed
   by the description and characterization of each component. Finally, 2-D
   separation of 50 analytes, including alkane (C-6-C-12), alkene, alcohol,
   aldehyde, ketone, cycloalkane, and aromatic hydrocarbon, in 14 min is
   demonstrated, showing the peak capacity of 430-530 and the peak capacity
   production of 40-80/min.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is used to study carrier energy relaxation
   following thermionic emission at the junction of two van der Waals
   bonded single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). An energy-dependent
   transmission probability gives rise to energy filtering at the junction,
   which is predicted to increase the average electron transport energy by
   as much as 0.115 eV, leading to an effective Seebeck coefficient of 386
   mu V/K. MC results predict a long energy relaxation length (similar to 8
   mu m) for hot electrons crossing the junction into the barrier SWCNT.
   For SWCNTs of optimal length, an analytical transport model is used to
   show that thermionic cooling can outweigh parasitic heat conduction due
   to high SWCNT thermal conductivity, leading to a significant cooling
   capacity (2.4 x 10(6) W/cm(2)). Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{By exploiting the guided resonance of a photonic hypercrystal-a periodic
   structure that combines the properties of hyperbolic materials and
   photonic crystals-we numerically demonstrate a perfect absorber
   consisting of a photonic hypercrystal slab, a dielectric spacer, and a
   back reflector. The guided resonance of the photonic hypercrystal slab
   creates a field enhancement and confinement within a deep subwavelength
   thickness; therefore, the ultrathin photonic hypercrystal slab serves as
   a two-dimensional resonator that can be treated accurately as a
   metasurface. We show that the perfect absorber is equivalent to a
   metasurface Salisbury screen, where the metasurface formed by the
   photonic hypercrystal slab provides the appropriate electric sheet
   conductivity required for critical coupling. We also present examples of
   combining the perfect absorber with graphene to make optical modulators
   and to improve the absorption in graphene photodetectors.}},

   transition}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Scrutinizing distinct solid/liquid (s/l) and solid/solid (s/s) phase
   transitions (passive transitions) for large change in bulk (and
   homogenous) thermal conductivity, we find the s/l semiconductor/metal
   (S/M) transition produces the largest dimensionless thermal conductivity
   switch (TCS) figure of merit Z(TCS) (change in thermal conductivity
   divided by smaller conductivity). At melting temperature, the solid
   phonon and liquid molecular thermal conductivities are comparable and
   generally small, so the TCS requires localized electron solid and
   delocalized electron liquid states. For cyclic phase reversibility, the
   congruent phase transition (no change in composition) is as important as
   the thermal transport. We identify XSb and XAs (X = Al, Cd, Ga, In, Zn)
   and describe atomic-structural metrics for large Z(TCS), then show the
   superiority of S/M phonon-to electron-dominated transport melting
   transition. We use existing experimental results and theoretical and ab
   initio calculations of the related properties for both phases (including
   the Kubo-Greenwood and Bridgman formulations of liquid conductivities).
   The 5p orbital of Sb contributes to the semiconductor behavior in the
   solid-phase band gap and upon disorder and bond-length changes in the
   liquid phase this changes to metallic, creating the large contrast in
   thermal conductivity. The charge density distribution, electronic
   localization function, and electron density of states are used to mark
   this S/M transition. For optimal TCS, we examine the elemental selection
   from the transition, basic, and semimetals and semiconductor groups. For
   CdSb, addition of residual Ag suppresses the bipolar conductivity and
   its Z(TCS) is over 7, and for Zn3Sb2 it is expected to be over 14, based
   on the structure and transport properties of the better-known
   beta-Zn4Sb3. This is the highest Z(TCS) identified. In addition to the
   metallic melting, the high Z(TCS) is due to the electron-poor nature of
   II-V semiconductors, leading to the significantly low phonon
   conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling fuel consumption of light-duty passenger vehicles has created
   substantial concerns due to the uncertainty from real-world operating
   conditions. Macao is world-renowned for its tourism industry and high
   population density. An empirical model is developed to estimate
   real-world fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for
   gasoline-powered light-duty passenger vehicles in Macao by considering
   local fleet configuration and operating conditions. Thanks to
   increasingly stringent fuel consumption limits in vehicle manufacturing
   countries, estimated type-approval fuel consumption for light-duty
   passenger vehicles in Macao by model year was reduced from 7.4 L/100 km
   in 1995 to 5.9 L/100 km in 2012, although a significant upsizing trend
   has considerably offset potential energy-saving benefit. However, lower
   driving speed and the air-conditioning usage tend to raise fleet-average
   fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission factors, which are
   estimated to be 10.1 L/100 km and 240 Mon in 2010. Fleet-total fuel
   consumption and carbon dioxide emissions are modeled through registered
   vehicle population-based and link-level traffic demand approaches and
   the results satisfactorily coincide with the historical record of fuel
   sales in Macao. Temporal and spatial variations in fuel consumption and
   carbon dioxide emissions from light-duty passenger vehicles further
   highlight the importance of effective traffic management in congested
   areas of Macao. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Moisture transport properties in concrete have been shown to have great
   implications on the freeze-thaw (F-T) durability. In this paper, the
   slow process of gradual air void filling in air-entrained concrete under
   continuous wet exposure is further explored based on Fagerlund's work.
   The concomitant effect on the air-void properties is quantified by a
   geometrical model, where the change in specific surface and void spacing
   is computed due to gradual void saturation of different size classes
   based on the linear traverse method. This information, when combined
   with the measured secondary rate of water absorption, is able to predict
   the time to reach a critical saturation level gauged by the threshold
   void spacing, as exemplified by an air-entrained 0.45 water-cement (w/c)
   ratio concrete mix. Air void characteristics (air content and the size
   distribution), the important factors in controlling internal frost
   durability, are simulated using an S-shaped curve and their effect on
   the critical time is investigated by this geometrical model. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) is a widely used technique for
   lithium-ion battery state-of-health (SOH) evaluation. The effectiveness
   and robustness of ICA for single cell diagnostics have been reported in
   many published work. In this study, we extend the ICA based SOH
   monitoring approach from single cells to battery modules, which consist
   of battery cells with various aging conditions. In order to achieve
   on-board implementation, an IC peak tracking approach based on the ICA
   principles is proposed. Analytical, numerical and experimental results
   are presented to demonstrate the utility of the IC peak tracking
   framework on multi-cell battery SOH monitoring and the effects of cell
   non-uniformity on the proposed method. Results show that the methods
   developed for single cell capacity estimation can also be used for a
   module or pack that has parallel-connected cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The energy and environmental benefits of electric vehicles (EVs) are
   highly dependent on individual driving patterns. To characterize
   individual driving patterns in Beijing, a populated megacity in East
   Asian, GPS-based travel data from 459 private passenger vehicles were
   gathered covering nearly 17,000 sampling days in 2013-2015. The data
   were analyzed using a statistical model to produce 0.5 h, 4 h, 8 h and
   daily individual trip chain distributions, which were used to evaluate
   customer acceptance for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) based on
   inconvenience thresholds and to assess the energy consumption for
   plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). The mean daily distances travelled on weekdays
   and weekends in Beijing were found to be 44.6 km and 51.4 km
   respectively. In Beijing the mean habitual travel distance (40.4 km) is
   modest, the random component of travel distance is lower, and the
   fraction of habitual travel is higher than for cities in the U.S. and in
   Germany. These factors make EV deployment in Beijing more favorable than
   in the U.S. or Germany. We show that the estimated acceptance rate for
   BEVs is very sensitive to the predetermined inconvenience threshold
   level. The abundant public transportation alternatives and traffic
   management in Beijing are factors which reduce the inconvenience of BEVs
   and may make them acceptable without substantially increased cost for
   larger battery capacity. PHEVs with all-electric ranges of 50 km
   (PHEV50) have an ensemble utility factor (UF) and equivalent gasoline
   consumption estimated to be 0.55 and 4.39 L/100 km. However, for 50\% of
   vehicle owners PHEV50s would have a UF of 0.94 and equivalent gasoline
   consumption of 3.03 L/100 km. Our results show that attention to
   heterogeneity among individuals instead of analysis at the ensemble
   level is essential to understanding the real-world acceptance and
   benefits of EVs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We treat the statistical inference problems in which one needs to detect
   the correct signal model among multiple hypotheses and estimate a
   parameter simultaneously using as small number of samples as possible.
   Conventional methods treat the detection and estimation subproblems
   separately, ignoring the intrinsic coupling between them. However, a
   joint detection and estimation problem should be solved to maximize the
   overall performance. We address the sample size concern through a
   sequential and Bayesian setup. Specifically, we seek the optimum triplet
   of stopping time, detector, and estimator(s) that minimizes the number
   of samples subject to a constraint on the combined detection and
   estimation cost. A general framework for optimum sequential joint
   detection and estimation is developed. The resulting optimum detector
   and estimator(s) are strongly coupled with each other, proving that the
   separate treatment is strictly suboptimum. The theoretical results
   derived for a quite general model are then applied to several problems
   with linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) models, including dynamic spectrum
   access in cognitive radio, and state estimation in smart grid with
   topological uncertainty. Numerical results corroborate the superior
   overall detection and estimation performance of the proposed schemes
   over the conventional methods that handle the subproblems separately.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{182}},
Pages = {{754-760}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study was shown that random forest (RF) can be used as a
   sensible new data mining tool for variable importance measurements
   (VIMs) through various coal properties for prediction of coke quality
   (Free Swelling Index (FSI)). The VIMs of RF within coal analyses
   (proximate, ultimate, and petrographic analyses) were applied for the
   selection of the best predictors of FSI over a wide range of Kentucky
   coal samples. VIMs assisted by Pearson correlation through proximate,
   ultimate, and petrographic analyses indicated that volatile matter,
   carbon, vitrinite, and R-max (coal rank parameters) are the most
   effective variables for the prediction of FSI. These important
   predictors have been used as inputs of RF model for the FSI prediction.
   Outputs in the testing stage of the model indicated that RF can predict
   FSI quite satisfactorily; the R-2 was 0.93 and mean square error from
   actual FSIs was 0.15 (had less than interval unit of FSI; 0.5).
   According to the result, by providing nonlinear inter-dependence
   approximation among parameters for variable selection and also
   non-parametric predictive model RF can potentially be further employed
   as a reliable and accurate technique for the determination of complex
   relationship through fuel and energy investigations. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Electronically-Controlled Beam-Steering through Vanadium Dioxide
   Metasurfaces}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Engineered metamaterials offer unique functionalities for manipulating
   the spectral and spatial properties of electromagnetic waves in
   unconventional ways. Here, we report a novel approach for making
   reconfigurable metasurfaces capable of deflecting electromagnetic waves
   in an electronically controllable fashion. This is accomplished by
   tilting the phase front of waves through a two-dimensional array of
   resonant metasurface unit-cells with electronically-controlled
   phase-change materials embedded inside. Such metasurfaces can be placed
   at the output facet of any electromagnetic radiation source to deflect
   electromagnetic waves at a desired frequency, ranging from
   millimeter-wave to far-infrared frequencies. Our design does not use any
   mechanical elements, external light sources, or reflectarrays, creating,
   for the first time, a highly robust and fully-integrated beam-steering
   device solution. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept beam-steering
   metasurface optimized for operation at 100 GHz, offering up to 44
   degrees beam deflection in both horizontal and vertical directions.
   Dynamic control of electromagnetic wave propagation direction through
   this unique platform could be transformative for various imaging,
   sensing, and communication applications, among others.}},

Abstract = {{We report observations of low-frequency waves at 1 au by the magnetic
   field instrument on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE/MAG) and show
   evidence that they arise due to newborn interstellar pickup He+.
   Twenty-five events are studied. They possess the generally predicted
   attributes: spacecraft-frame frequencies slightly greater than the He+
   cyclotron frequency, left-hand polarization in the spacecraft frame, and
   transverse fluctuations with minimum variance directions that are
   quasi-parallel to the mean magnetic field. Their occurrence spans the
   first 18 years of ACE operations, with no more than 3 such observations
   in any given year. Thus, the events are relatively rare. As with past
   observations by the Ulysses and Voyager spacecraft, we argue that the
   waves are seen only when the background turbulence is sufficiently weak
   as to allow for the slow accumulation of wave energy over many hours.}},

Abstract = {{The research presented herein involves a performance-based design method
   for a tall hybrid coupled wall (HCW) system. For this study, HCW
   structures were designed with a performance-based plastic design (PBPD)
   method. This approach directly accounts for inelastic structural
   behavior and considers design lateral force distribution at ultimate
   limit state. The design concept uses a pre-selected target drift and
   yield mechanism as key performance limit states. The yield mechanism
   consists of shear yielding in the coupling beams and flexural yielding
   of reinforced concrete walls at the bases. HCW structures with varying
   heights and coupling ratios (CRs) were designed and subjected to a
   series of nonlinear dynamic analyses. The results indicated that the CR
   strongly influences the response of the structure. The structures could
   also be under-designed when the inelastic distribution of lateral forces
   owing to higher modes was not properly considered. Finally, a design
   method to account for higher mode effects within the PBPD framework was
   presented. The method was validated using the results from nonlinear
   analyses. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Application of Random Forest (RF) via variable, importance measurements
   (VIMs) and prediction is a new data mining model, not yet wide spread in
   the applied science and engineering fields. In this study, the VIMs
   (proximate and ultimate analysis, petrography) processed by RF models
   were used for the prediction of Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) based
   on a wide range of Kentucky coal samples. VIMs, coupled with Pearson
   correlation, through various analyses indicated that total sulfur,
   liptinite, and vitrinite maximum reflectance (R-max) are the most
   importance variables for the prediction of HGI. These effective
   predictors have been used as inputs for the prediction of HGI by a RF
   model. Results indicated that the RF model can model HGI quite
   satisfactorily when the R-2 = 0.90 and 99\% of predicted HGls had less
   than 4 HGI unit error in the testing stage. According to the result, by
   providing nonlinear VIMs as well as an accurate prediction model, RF can
   be further employed as a reliable and accurate technique for the
   evaluation of complex relationships in coal processing investigations.

   specific assumptions for the axial force to preclude its measurement.
   Our analysis indicates that measuring gradients in filament curvature is
   necessary to accurately determine alpha when axial force is not
   measured. CBR experiments were performed on five silicone oils (0.35 Pa
   s < mu < 10 Pa s), three sample volumes, and three strains to evaluate
   the operating range of the differential analysis and compare its
   performance to that of a standard integral method from literature. We
   investigate the role of filament asymmetry, caused mainly by gravity, on
   the performance of the differential method for the range of conditions
   studied. Experimental and analytical details for resolving gradients of
   curvature are also given.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the effects of temperature dependence of the electrical and
   thermal conductivities on Joule heating of a one-dimensional conductor
   by solving the coupled non-linear steady state electrical and thermal
   conduction equations. The spatial temperature distribution and the
   maximum temperature and its location within the conductor are evaluated
   for four cases: (i) constant electrical conductivity and linear
   temperature dependence of thermal conductivity, (ii) linear temperature
   dependence of both electrical and thermal conductivities, (iii) the
   Wiedemann-Franz relation for metals, and (iv) polynomial fits to
   measured data for carbon nanotube fibers and for copper. For (i) and
   (ii), it is found that there are conditions under which no steady state
   solution exists, which may indicate the possibility of thermal runaway.
   For (i), analytical solutions are constructed, from which explicit
   expressions for the parameter bounds for the existence of steady state
   solutions are obtained. The shifting of these bounds due to the
   introduction of linear temperature dependence of electrical conductivity
   (case (ii)) is studied numerically. These results may provide guidance
   in the design of circuits and devices in which the effects of coupled
   thermal and electrical conduction are important. Published by AIP

Abstract = {{In cancer biology, there has been a recent effort to understand tumor
   formation in the context of the tissue microenvironment. In particular,
   recent progress has explored the mechanisms behind how changes in the
   cell-extracellular matrix ensemble influence progression of the disease.
   The extensive use of in vitro tissue culture models in simulant matrix
   has proven effective at studying such interactions, but modalities for
   non-invasively quantifying aspects of these systems are scant. We
   present the novel application of an imaging technique, Inverse
   Spectroscopic Optical Coherence Tomography, for the non-destructive
   measurement of in vitro biological samples during matrix remodeling. Our
   findings indicate that the nanoscale-sensitive mass density correlation
   shape factor D of cancer cells increases in response to a more
   crosslinked matrix. We present a facile technique for the non-invasive,
   quantitative study of the micro- and nano-scale structure of the
   extracellular matrix and its host cells.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated basic mechanisms of concrete corrosion by studying
   wollastonite in aqueous environments. This well-defined crystalline
   mineral is well-suited as a model system of calcium silicate phases, the
   main constituent of this important building material. A detailed
   peak-shape analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) signals recorded for
   wollastonite powders exposed to water allowed monitoring of dramatic
   changes in particle shape as a result of the so-called metal proton
   exchange reaction (MPER). Since these experiments were carried out for
   well-defined particles with known orientation, state-of-the art
   calculations using density functional theory (DFT) could be employed to
   more precisely study this behavior, which previously has not attracted
   much attention. The free energies of the different crystalline surfaces
   of wollastonite are strongly affected when brought into contact with
   water, thus providing a strong driving force for changes in particle
   shape. A more detailed analysis of the corresponding Wulff constructions
   reveals, however, that a quantitative description of these phenomena
   also requires a detailed analysis of the kinetics. Implications for
   concrete corrosion will be discussed, and strategies for its prevention
   will be outlined.}},

Abstract = {{We present COMPASS, a COmputational Model to Predict the development of

   changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores over 24-months
   using standardized data. In the present study, we conducted three
   additional analyses beyond the DREAM challenge question to improve the
   clinical contribution of our approach, including: (1) adding
   pre-validated baseline cognitive composite scores of ADNI-MEM and
   ADNI-EF, (2) identifying subjects with significant declines in MMSE
   scores, and (3) incorporating SNPs of top 10 genes connected to APOE
   identified from functional-relationship network. For (1) above, we
   significantly improved predictive accuracy, especially for the Mild
   Cognitive Impairment (MCI) group. For (2), we achieved an area under ROC
   of 0.814 in predicting significant MMSE decline: our model has 100\%
   precision at 5\% recall, and 91\% accuracy at 10\% recall. For (3),
   ``genetic only{''} model has Pearson's correlation of 0.15 to predict
   progression in the MCI group. Even though addition of this limited
   genetic model to COMPASS did not improve prediction of progression of
   MCI group, the predictive ability of SNP information extended beyond
   well-known APOE allele.}},

Abstract = {{Cirrus clouds in the tropical tropopause play a key role in regulating
   the moisture entering the stratosphere through their dehydrating effect.
   Low ice number concentrations (<200 L-1) and high supersaturations
   (150-160 \%) have been observed in these clouds. Different mechanisms
   have been proposed to explain these low ice number concentrations,
   including the inhibition of homogeneous freezing by the deposition of
   water vapour onto pre-existing ice crystals, heterogeneous ice formation
   on glassy organic aerosol ice nuclei (IN), and limiting the formation of
   ice number from high-frequency gravity waves. In this study, we examined
   the effect from three different representations of updraft velocities,
   the effect from pre-existing ice crystals, the effect from different
   water vapour deposition coefficients (alpha = 0.1 or 1), and the effect
   of 0.1\% of the total secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles acting
   as IN. Model-simulated ice crystal numbers are compared against an
   aircraft observational dataset.
   Including the effect from water vapour deposition on preexisting ice
   particles can effectively reduce simulated incloud ice number
   concentrations for all model setups. A larger water vapour deposition
   coefficient (alpha = 1) can also efficiently reduce ice number
   concentrations at temperatures below 205 K, but less so at higher
   temperatures. SOA acting as IN is most effective at reducing ice number
   concentrations when the effective updraft velocities are moderate
   (similar to 0.05-0.2 m s(-1)). However, the effects of including SOA as
   IN and using (alpha = 1) are diminished when the effect from
   pre-existing ice is included.
   When a grid-resolved large-scale updraft velocity (<0.1 m s(-1)) is
   used, the ice nucleation parameterization with homogeneous freezing only
   or with both homogeneous freezing and heterogeneous nucleation is able
   to generate low ice number concentrations in good agreement with
   observations for temperatures below 205K as long as the pre-existing ice
   effect is included. For the moderate updraft velocity (similar to
   0.05-0.2 m s(-1)), simulated ice number concentrations in good agreement
   with observations at temperatures below 205K can be achieved if effects
   from pre-existing ice, a larger water vapour deposition coefficient
   (alpha = 1), and SOA IN are all included. Using the sub-grid-scale
   turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)-based updraft velocity (similar to 0-2 m
   s(-1)) always overestimates the ice number concentrations at
   temperatures below 205 K but compares well with observations at
   temperatures above 205 K when the pre-existing ice effect is included.}},

Abstract = {{Using several-mJ energy pulses from a high-repetition rate (1/2 kHz),
   ultrashort (35 fs) pulsed laser interacting with a similar to 10 mu m
   diameter stream of free-flowing heavy water (D2O), we demonstrate a
   2.45MeV neutron flux of 10(5)/s. Operating at high intensity (of order
   10 19 W/cm(2)), laser pulse energy is efficiently absorbed in the
   pre-plasma, generating energetic deuterons. These collide with deuterium
   nuclei in both the bulk target and the large volume of low density D2O
   vapor surrounding the target to generate neutrons through d(d,n)(3) He
   reactions. The neutron flux, as measured by a calibrated neutron bubble
   detector, increases as the laser pulse energy is increased from 6 mJ to
   12 mJ. A quantitative comparison between the measured flux and the
   results derived from 2D-particle-in-cell simulations shows comparable
   neutron fluxes for laser characteristics similar to the experiment. The
   simulations reveal that there are two groups of deuterons. Forward
   moving deuterons generate deuterium-deuterium fusion reactions in the
   D2O stream and act as a point source of neutrons, while backward moving
   deuterons propagate through the low-density D2O vapor filled chamber and
   yield a volumetric source of neutrons. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The standard method for specifying target responses for human
   surrogates, such as crash test dummies and human computational models,
   involves developing a corridor based on the distribution of a set of
   empirical mechanical responses. These responses are commonly normalized
   to account for the effects of subject body shape, size, and mass on
   impact response. Limitations of this method arise from the normalization
   techniques, which are based on the assumptions that human geometry
   linearly scales with size and in some cases, on simple mechanical
   models. To address these limitations, a new method was developed for
   corridor generation that applies principal component (PC) analysis to
   align response histories. Rather than use normalization techniques to
   account for the effects of subject size on impact response, linear
   regression models are used to model the relationship between PC features
   and subject characteristics. Corridors are generated using Monte Carlo
   simulation based on estimated distributions of PC features for each PC.
   This method is applied to pelvis impact force data from a recent series
   of lateral impact tests to develop corridor bounds for a group of
   signals associated with a particular subject size. Comparing to the two
   most common methods for response normalization, the corridors generated
   by the new method are narrower and better retain the features in signals
   that are related to subject size and body shape. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Smoothing spline analysis of variance models: A new tool for the

Abstract = {{Cyclic biomechanical data are commonplace in orthopedic, rehabilitation,
   and sports research, where the goal is to understand and compare
   biomechanical differences between experimental conditions and/or subject
   populations. A common approach to analyzing cyclic biomechanical data
   involves averaging the biomechanical signals across cycle replications,
   and then comparing mean differences at specific points of the cycle.
   This pointwise analysis approach ignores the functional nature of the
   data, which can hinder one's ability to find subtle differences between
   experimental conditions and/or subject populations. To overcome this
   limitation, we propose using mixed-effects smoothing spline analysis of
   variance (SSANOVA) to analyze differences in cyclic biomechanical data.
   The SSANOVA framework makes it possible to decompose the estimated
   function into the portion that is common across groups (Le., the average
   cycle, AC) and the portion that differs across groups (i.e., the
   contrast cycle, CC). By partitioning the signal in such a manner, we can
   obtain estimates, of the CC differences (CCDs), which are the functions
   directly describing group differences in the cyclic biomechanical data.
   Using both simulated and experimental data, we illustrate the benefits
   of using SSANOVA models to analyze differences in noisy biomechanical
   (gait) signals collected from multiple locations (joints) of subjects
   participating in different experimental conditions. Using Bayesian
   confidence intervals, the SSANOVA results can be used in clinical and
   research settings to reliably quantify biomechanical differences between
   experimental conditions and/or subject populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Dynamic Weight-Shifting for Improved Maneuverability and Rollover
   Prevention in High-Speed Mobile Manipulators}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Mobile manipulators have reduced maneuverability and risk rolling over
   when operated at high speeds. One of the main contributing factors is
   the higher center of gravity (CG) due to the manipulator arm. This paper
   proposes a new dynamic weight-shifting method that uses the manipulator
   arm on the mobile robot to improve maneuverability and reduce rollover
   risk. A control law is developed such that the manipulator arm keeps a
   low CG and the contribution of the reaction moments from its inertia is
   small in comparison to the reaction moments due to gravity. A linear
   dynamic model is used to analyze the effect of the arm design (link
   length, mass, etc.) on the roll dynamics. A higher fidelity nonlinear
   simulation is used to evaluate roll reduction and the impact on handling
   dynamics. Last, the dynamic weight-shifting method is implemented in
   hardware. With regard to reducing rollover risk, simulation results from
   the nonlinear model (NLM) show a 29\% reduction in wheel normal load
   transfer by using the proposed method. In terms of improving
   maneuverability, experimental results with hardware demonstrate a 13\%
   increase in lateral acceleration when using dynamic weight-shifting. By
   reducing the vehicle's roll motion, dynamic weight-shifting can increase
   safe operating speeds and maneuverability.}},

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{B}},

Abstract = {{The Algebraic Structure-based Model (ASBM) is an engineering model of
   turbulence that incorporates information about the morphology of
   turbulent structures, and thus characterizes additional turbulence
   information beyond what is provided solely by the Reynolds stresses. In
   this work, a new formulation of the ASBM is developed that exhibits
   three defining characteristics. The first is a near-wall correction
   segregated from the homogeneous component of the model, which allows for
   a new paradigm for model development and comparison. The second
   characteristic is a set of fully-explicit equations that replace the
   original implicit formulation and make evident the highly nonlinear
   nature of the model. Finally, the last defining characteristic is based
   on the coupling of the ASBM with turbulent transport equations that
   provide the required turbulent scales. Using arguments of consistency,
   stability, and accuracy we arrive at a model that uses transport
   equations for k and is an element of. The resulting model is simpler to
   implement, more robust, and amenable to further development. The
   analysis of the new ASBM formulation is carried out by computing
   fully-developed channel, pipe and squared duct flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   the combination of recent advances in electronics, photonics and
   nanotechnology, these miniature devices may integrate with solid-state
   platforms, achieving superior performance. This paper reviews recent
   modelling efforts on quantum tunnelling, ultrafast electron emission and
   transport, and electrical contact resistance. Unsolved problems and
   challenges in these areas are addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that low-energy ion heating occurs in the
   magnetosphere due to strong equatorial noise emission. Observations from
   the Van Allen Probes Helium Oxygen Proton Electron (HOPE) instrument
   recently determined that there was a depletion in the 1-10 eV ion
   population in the postmidnight sector of Earth during quiet times at L <
   3. The diurnal variation of equatorially mirroring 1-10 eV H+ ions at 2
   < L < 3 is connected with similar diurnal variation in the electric
   field component of plasma waves ranging between 150 and 600 Hz.
   Measurements from the Van Allen Probes Electric and Magnetic Field
   Instrument Suite and Integrated Science (EMFISIS) data set are used to
   analyze waves of this frequency in near-Earth space. However, when we
   examine the polarization of the waves in the 150 to 600 Hz range in the
   equatorial plane, the majority are right-hand polarized plasmaspheric
   hiss waves. The 1-10 eV H+ equatorially mirroring population does not
   interact with right-hand waves, despite a strong statistical
   relationship suggesting that the two are linked. We present evidence
   supporting the relationship, both in our own work and the literature,
   but we ultimately conclude that the 1-10 eV H+ heating is not related to
   the strong enhancement of 150 to 600 Hz waves.}},

Title = {{On the links between the radio flux and magnetodisk distortions at

Volume = {{121}},

Abstract = {{Using measurements of the Galileo magnetometer and plasma wave
   instrument, it is shown that the flux of the Jovian auroral radio
   emissions is correlated with the azimuthal component of the magnetic
   field (B-phi) measured in the plasma disk, the situations of large
   magnetic twist of the disk (large Delta B-phi, the difference between
   the measured and the model field) corresponding to enhanced radio
   intensities (frequency>300 kHz). For the four orbits discussed here
   (three in the postmidnight and one in the premidnight sector),
   representing similar to 44 days of observations, from 25 to 85 Jovian
   radius in the magnetodisk, the radio intensity observed during periods
   of small radial current (Delta B-phi< 1 nT) is typically a factor of 5
   to 10 smaller than that observed at large radial current (Delta B-phi>
   5-6 nT). It is proposed that these variations are the direct
   consequences of enhanced magnetosphere/ionosphere coupling current
   systems linked to episodes of larger outward mass outflows in the disk,
   resulting in larger parallel currents and, thus, in enhanced auroral
   activity. The application of Hill's model shows that the observed
   variations of B-phi can be explained by increasing the mass outflow rate
   from similar to 150 kg/s (quiet periods) to more than 2 t/s
   ({''}energetic{''} events), for Pedersen conductance ranging from 0.1 to
   1 S. This is consistent with the canonical values given in the
   literature. It is estimated that these modulations of the mass flow
   rates lead to variations of the power dissipated in the disk from
   similar to 10(14) to 10(15) W due to the torque exerted by the magnetic
   coupling with Jupiter's ionosphere, with a conversion rate into the
   power radiated by the radio waves of the order of 10(-6).}},

Abstract = {{We study the proton-to-electron temperature ratio (T-p/T-e) in the
   plasma sheet (PS) of the Earth's magnetotail using 5 years of Cluster
   observations (2001-2005). The PS intervals are searched within a region
   defined with -19 < X <= -7 R-E and vertical bar Y vertical bar < 15 R-E
   (GSM) under the condition vertical bar B-X vertical bar <= 10 nT. One
   hundred sixty PS crossings are identified. We find an average value of <
   T-p/T-e> similar to 6.0. However, in many PS intervals T-p/T-e varies
   over a wide range from a few units to several tens of units. In 86 PS
   intervals the T-p/T-e decreases below 3.5. Generally, the decreases of
   T-p/T-e are due to some increase of T-e while T-p either decreases or
   remains unchanged. In the majority of these intervals the T-p/T-e drops
   are observed during magnetotail dipolarizations. A superposed epoch
   analysis applied to these events shows that the minimum value of T-p/T-e
   is observed after the dipolarization onset during the ``turbulent
   phase{''} of dipolarization, when a number of transient B-Z pulses are
   reduced, but the value of B-Z is still large and an intensification of
   wave activity is observed. The T-p/T-e drops, and associated increases
   of Te often coincide either with bursts of broadband electrostatic
   emissions, which may include electron cyclotron harmonics, or with
   broadband electromagnetic emission in a frequency range from proton
   plasma frequency (f(pp)) up to the electron gyrofrequency (f(ce)). These
   findings show that the wave activity developing in the current sheet
   after dipolarization onset may play a role in the additional electron
   heating and the associated T-p/T-e decrease.}},

   caused by the 2015 St. Patrick's Day storm. While significant GIC
   activity in the high-latitude regions due to storm time substorm
   activity is shown for this event, enhanced GIC activity was also
   measured at two equatorial stations in the American and Southeast Asian
   sectors. This equatorial GIC activity is closely examined, and it is
   shown that it is present both during the arrival of the interplanetary
   shock at the storm sudden commencement (SSC) in Southeast Asia and
   during the main phase of the storm similar to 10 h later in South
   America. The SSC caused magnetic field variations at the equator in
   Southeast Asia that were twice the magnitude of those observed only a
   few degrees to the north, strongly indicating that the equatorial
   electrojet (EEJ) played a significant role. The large equatorial
   magnetic field variations measured in South America are also examined,
   and the coincident solar wind data are used to investigate the causes of
   the sudden changes in the EEJ similar to 10 h into the storm. From this
   analysis it is concluded that sudden magnetopause current increases due
   to increases in the solar wind dynamic pressure, and the sudden changes
   in the resultant magnetospheric and ionospheric current systems, are the
   primary drivers of equatorial GICs.}},

Abstract = {{In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac, a Category 1 hurricane at landfall,
   caused extensive power outages in Louisiana. The storm brought high
   winds, storm surge, and flooding to Louisiana, and power outages were
   widespread and prolonged. Hourly power outage data for the state of
   Louisiana were collected during the storm and analyzed. This analysis
   included correlation of hourly power outage figures by zip code with
   storm conditions including wind, rainfall, and storm surge using a
   nonparametric ensemble data mining approach. Results were analyzed to
   understand how correlation of power outages with storm conditions
   differed geographically within the state. This analysis provided insight
   on how rainfall and storm surge, along with wind, contribute to power
   outages in hurricanes. By conducting a longitudinal study of outages at
   the zip code level, we were able to gain insight into the causal drivers
   of power outages during hurricanes. Our analysis showed that the
   statistical importance of storm characteristic covariates to power
   outages varies geographically. For Hurricane Isaac, wind speed,
   precipitation, and previous outages generally had high importance,
   whereas storm surge had lower importance, even in zip codes that
   experienced significant surge. The results of this analysis can inform
   the development of power outage forecasting models, which often focus
   strictly on wind-related covariates. Our study of Hurricane Isaac
   indicates that inclusion of other covariates, particularly
   precipitation, may improve model accuracy and robustness across a range
   of storm conditions and geography.}},

Abstract = {{The Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) was created in 2000 to
   allow researchers to remotely run simulations and explore the results
   through online tools. Since that time, over 10,000 simulations have been
   conducted at CCMC through their runs-on-request service. Many of those
   simulations have been event studies using global magnetohydrodynamic
   (MHD) models of the magnetosphere. All of these simulations are
   available to the general public to explore and utilize. Many of these
   simulations have had virtual satellites flown through the model to
   extract the simulation results at the satellite location as a function
   of time. This study used 662 of these magnetospheric simulations, with a
   total of 2503 satellite traces, to statistically compare the magnetic
   field simulated by models to the satellite data. Ratings for each
   satellite trace were created by comparing the root-mean-square error of
   the trace with all of the other traces for the given satellite and
   magnetic field component. The 1-5 ratings, with 5 being the best quality
   run, are termed stars. From these star ratings, a few conclusions were
   made: (1) Simulations tend to have a lower rating for higher levels of
   activity; (2) there was a clear bias in the B-z component of the
   simulations at geosynchronous orbit, implying that the models were
   challenged in simulating the inner magnetospheric dynamics correctly;
   and (3) the highest performing model included a coupled ring current
   model, which was about 0.15 stars better on average than the same model
   without the ring current model coupling.}},

Abstract = {{Abrupt transitions from slow to fast solar wind represent a concern for
   the space weather forecasting community. They may cause geomagnetic
   storms that can eventually affect systems in orbit and on the ground.
   Therefore, the probability distribution function (PDF) model was
   improved to predict enhancements in the solar wind speed. New
   probability distribution functions allow for the prediction of the peak
   amplitude and the time to the peak while providing an interval of
   uncertainty on the prediction. It was found that 60\% of the positive
   predictions were correct, while 91\% of the negative predictions were
   correct, and 20\% to 33\% of the peaks in the speed were found by the
   model. This represents a considerable improvement upon the first version
   of the PDF model. A direct comparison with the Wang-Sheeley-Arge model
   shows that the PDF model is quite similar, except that it leads to fewer
   false positive predictions and misses fewer events, especially when the
   peak reaches very high speeds.}},

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a useful way to
   accelerate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As acceleration
   becomes more aggressive, an increasingly larger number of receive coils
   are required to separate the slices, which significantly increases the
   computational burden. We propose a coil compression method that works
   with concentric ring non-Cartesian SMS imaging and should work with
   Cartesian SMS as well. We evaluate the method on fMRI scans of several
   subjects and compare it to standard coil compression methods.
   Methods: The proposed method uses a slice-separation k-space kernel to
   simultaneously compress coil data into a set of virtual coils. Five
   subjects were scanned using both non-SMS fMRI and SMS fMRI with three
   simultaneous slices. The SMS fMRI scans were processed using the
   proposed method, along with other conventional methods. Code is
   available at https://github.com/alcu/sms.
   Results: The proposed method maintained functional activation with a
   fewer number of virtual coils than standard SMS coil compression
   methods. Compression of non-SMS fMRI maintained activation with a
   slightly lower number of virtual coils than the proposed method, but
   does not have the acceleration advantages of SMS fMRI.
   Conclusion: The proposed method is a practical way to compress and
   reconstruct concentric ring SMS data and improves the preservation of
   functional activation over standard coil compression methods in fMRI.

Volume = {{76}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Develop a method for rapid three-dimensional inner-volume (IV),
   or reduced field-of-view, steady-state imaging.
   Methods: Tailored radiofrequency pulses for exciting a three-dimensional
   IV were designed using a recently proposed algorithm and used in three
   different sequences: spoiled gradient echo, balanced steady-state free
   precession, and ``small-tip fast recovery{''} (STFR) which uses a
   ``tip-up{''} RF pulse after the readout to fast recover spins to the
   longitudinal axis. The inner-and outer-volume (OV) steady-state signals
   were analyzed. To demonstrate the potential utility of the proposed
   method, segmented stack-of-spirals reduced field-of-view images in a
   volunteer were acquired.
   Results: For a given three-dimensional IV excitation pulse, STFR can
   achieve higher IV/OV signal ratio compared with spoiled gradient echo
   and balanced steady-state free precession. For spoiled gradient echo and
   balanced steady-state free precession, this ratio is significantly lower
   than that produced by a single IV excitation. For STFR, this ratio
   exceeds that produced by a single IV excitation, due to partial OV
   saturation produced by the nonspatially selective tip-up pulse. Reduced
   FOV STFR stack-of-spirals imaging with 2-fold under-sampling in both x-y
   and z is demonstrated.
   Conclusion: STFR provides an effective mechanism for OV suppression in
   steady-state IV imaging. The recently proposed joint pulse design method
   can be used in the STFR sequence to achieve fast reduced field-of-view
   imaging. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide ice is abundant on the Martian surface and plays an
   important role in the planet's energy budget due to its high
   reflectivity and seasonal variation. Here we adapt the terrestrial Snow,
   Ice, and Aerosol Radiation (SNICAR) model to simulate CO2 snow albedo
   across the ultraviolet, visible, and near-IR spectra (0.2-5.0 mu m). We
   apply recent laboratory-derived refractive indices of CO2 ice, which
   produce higher broadband CO2 snow albedo (0.93-0.98) than previously
   estimated. Compared with H2O snow, we find that CO2 snow albedo is much
   higher in the near-IR spectrum, less dependent on ice grain size, less
   dependent on solar zenith angle, and more susceptible to darkening from
   dust. A mass concentration of 0.01\% Martian dust reduces visible and
   near-IR CO2 snow albedos by about 60\% and 35\%, respectively. The
   presence of small amounts of H2O snow on top of CO2 snow can
   substantially decrease the surface albedo. Whereas 2.5cm of H2O snow can
   completely mask the impact of underlying CO2 ice or the surface, roughly
   twice as much overlying CO2 snow is required to mask underlying H2O
   snow. Similarly, a 10\% mixing ratio of H2O ice embedded in CO2 snow
   decreases broadband albedo by 0.18, while 10\% CO2 ice elevates H2O snow
   broadband albedo by 0.10. We also present comparisons between
   hemispherical albedo produced by SNICAR and observations of directional
   reflectance of Martian polar ice caps. While imperfect, this best fit
   analysis provides general ranges of physical parameters in different
   Martian environments that produce reasonable model-observation
   agreement.}},

Abstract = {{The detection of methane in the atmosphere of Mars was first reported in
   2004. Since then a number of independent observations of methane have
   been reported, all showing temporal variability. Up until recently, the
   origin of methane was attributed to sources either indigenous to Mars or
   exogenous, where methane is a UV degradation byproduct of organics
   falling on to the surface. Most recently, a new hypothesis has been
   proposed that argues that the appearance and variation of methane are
   correlated with specific meteor events at Mars. Indeed, extraplanetary
   material can be brought to a planet when it passes through a meteoroid
   stream left behind by cometary bodies orbiting the Sun. This occurs
   repeatedly at specific times in a planet's year as streams tend to be
   fairly stable in space. In this paper, we revisit this latest hypothesis
   by carrying out a complete analysis of all available data on Mars
   atmospheric methane, including the very recent data not previously
   published, together with all published predicted meteor events for Mars.
   Whether we consider the collection of individual data points and
   predicted meteor events, whether we apply statistical analysis, or
   whether we consider different time spans between high methane
   measurements and the occurrence of meteor events, we find no compelling
   evidence for any correlation between atmospheric methane and predicted
   meteor events.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy is a non-invasive ultrasonic ablation method that uses
   cavitation to mechanically fractionate tissue into acellular debris.
   With a sufficient number of pulses, histotripsy can completely
   fractionate tissue into a liquid-appearing homogenate with no cellular
   structures. The location, shape and size of lesion formation closely
   match those of the cavitation cloud. Previous work has led to the
   hypothesis that the rapid expansion and collapse of histotripsy bubbles
   fractionate tissue by inducing large stress and strain on the tissue
   structures immediately adjacent to the bubbles. In the work described
   here, the histotripsy bulk tissue fractionation process is visualized at
   the cellular level for the first time using a custom-built 2-MHz
   transducer incorporated into a microscope stage. A layer of breast
   cancer cells were cultured within an optically transparent fibrin-based
   gel phantom to mimic cells inside a 3-D extracellular matrix. To test
   the hypothesis, the cellular response to single and multiple histotripsy
   pulses was investigated using high-speed optical imaging. Bubbles were
   always generated in the extracellular space, and significant cell
   displacement/deformation was observed for cells directly adjacent to the
   bubble during both bubble expansion and collapse. The largest
   displacements were observed during collapse for cells immediately
   adjacent to the bubble, with cells moving more than 150-300 mu m in less
   than 100 mu s. Cells often underwent multiple large deformations (>150\%
   strain) over multiple pulses, resulting in the bisection of cells
   multiple times before complete removal. To provide theoretical support
   to the experimental observations, a numerical simulation was conducted
   using a single-bubble model, which indicated that histotripsy exerts the
   largest strains and cell displacements in the regions immediately
   adjacent to the bubble. The experimental and simulation results support
   our hypothesis, which helps to explain the formation of the sharp
   lesions formed in histotripsy therapy localized to the regions directly
   exposed to the bubbles. (C) 2016 World Federation for Ultrasound in

Abstract = {{Water loss in low permeability reservoirs during hydraulic fracturing
   well completions typically results in a decrease in natural gas
   production due to capillary trapping near the fractures. Shale gas
   reservoirs, however, have shown a trend of improved gas production with
   increased loss of completion fluids to the shale. This nonintuitive
   relationship between water imbibition and enhanced gas production in
   shale gas reservoirs is explored here through investigation of shale
   wettability alteration after exposure to two surfactants, one cationic
   and one anionic, commonly used in hydraulic fracturing fluids.
   Wettability alteration of samples from two unconventional natural gas
   reservoirs, the Marcellus and Collingwood shales, was examined in this
   study. In addition to individual surfactant solutions, 1:1 mixtures of
   cationic and anionic surfactants were examined at concentrations above
   and below critical micelle concentration levels. This study provides
   deeper understanding of adsorption mechanisms of cationic, anionic, and
   mixed ionic surfactants on the Marcellus and Collingwood reservoirs.
   Mixed surfactants were observed to alter wettability of shale from
   intermediate water-wet to more oil-wet and lower the capillary pressure
   and interfacial tension between gas and liquid phases at very low
   concentration (<0.45mM). Such a reduction in capillary pressure may
   reduce capillary trapping of natural gas by imbibed treatment water and
   may help explain why natural gas production in the Marcellus and
   Collingwood has been observed to increase even after water is lost to
   the reservoir during shut-in periods.}},

Title = {{Removal of Radium from Synthetic Shale Gas Brines by Ion Exchange Resin}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Rapid development of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas production
   from shale reservoirs presents a significant challenge related to the
   management of the high-salinity wastewaters that return to the surface.
   In addition to high total dissolved solids (TDS), shale gas-produced
   brines typically contain elevated concentrations of radium (Ra), which
   must be treated properly to prevent contamination of surface waters and
   allow for safe disposal or reuse of produced water. Treatment strategies
   that isolate radium in the lowest volume waste streams would be
   desirable to reduce disposal cost and generate useful treatment
   by-products. The present study evaluates the potential of a commercial
   strong acid cation exchange resin for removing Ra2+ from high-TDS brines
   using fixed-bed column reactors. Column reactors were operated with
   varying brine chemistries and salinities in an effort to find optimal
   conditions for Ra2+ removal through ion exchange. To overcome competing
   divalent cations present in the brine for exchange sites, the chelating
   agent, EDTA, was used to form stable complexes predominantly with the
   higher concentration Ca2+, Mg2+, and Sr2+ divalent cations, while
   isolating the much lower concentration Ra2+ species. Results showed that
   Ra2+ removal by the resin strongly depended on the TDS concentration and
   could be improved with careful selection of EDTA concentration. This
   strategy of metal chelation coupled with ion exchange resins may be
   effective in enhancing Ra2+ removal and reducing the generation and
   disposal cost if volume reduction of low-level radioactive solid waste
   can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:To test the null hypothesis that six factors representing
   potential fascial and muscular failure sites contribute equally to the
   presence and size of a cystocele: two vaginal attachment factors (apical
   support and paravaginal defects), two vaginal wall factors (vaginal
   length and width), and two levator ani factors (hiatus size and levator
   ani defects).METHODS:Thirty women with anterior-predominant prolapse
   (women in a case group) and 30 women in a control group underwent
   three-dimensional stress magnetic resonance imaging. The location of the
   anterior vaginal wall at maximal Valsalva was identified with the
   modified Pelvic Inclination Coordinate System and the six factors
   measured. Analysis included repeated-measure analysis of variance,
   logistic regression, and stepwise linear regression.RESULTS:We
   identified a collinear triad consisting of apical location, paravaginal
   location, and hiatus size that were not only the strongest predictors of
   cystocele size, but were also highly correlated with one another
   (r=0.84-0.89, P<.001) for the presence and size of the prolapse.
   Together they explain up to 83\% of the variation in cystocele size.
   Among the less significant vaginal factors, vaginal length explained
   19\% of the variation in cystocele size, but no significant difference
   in vaginal width existed. Women in the case group were more likely to
   have abnormalities in collinear triad factors (up to 80\%) than vaginal
   wall factors (up to 23.3\%). Combining the strongest collinear triad
   with the vaginal factors, the model explained 92.5\% of the variation in
   cystocele size.CONCLUSION:Apical location, paravaginal location, and
   hiatus size are highly correlated and are strong predictors of cystocele
   presence and size.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Major Depressive Disorder(MDD) and anxiety disorders often
   co-occur, with poorer treatment response and long-term outcomes.
   However, little is known about the shared and distinct neural mechanisms
   of comorbid MDD and anxiety (MDD+Anx). This study examined how MDD and
   MDD+Anx differentially impact cognitive control.
   Methods: Eighteen MDD, 29 MDD+Anx, and 54 healthy controls (HC)
   completed the Parametric Go/No-Go (PGNG) during fMRI, including Target,
   Commission, and Rejection trials.
   Results: MDD+Anx had more activation in the anterior dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate during Rejections, and
   inferior parietal lobule during correct Targets than MDD and HC. During
   Rejections HC had greater activation in a number of cognitive control
   regions compared to MDD; in the posterior cingulate compared to MDD+Anx;
   and in the fusiform gyrus compared to all MDD. During Commissions HC had
   greater activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus than all MDD. MDD
   had more activation in the mid-cingulate, inferior parietal lobule, and
   superior temporal gyrus than MDD+Anx during Commissions.
   Conclusions: Despite similar performance, MDD and MDD+Anx showed
   distinct differences in neural mechanisms of cognitive control in
   relation to each other, as well as some shared differences in relation
   to HC. The results were consistent with our hypothesis of hypervigilance
   in MDD+Anx within the cognitive control network, but inconsistent with
   our hypothesis that there would be greater engagement of salience and
   emotion network regions. Comorbidity of depression and anxiety may cause
   increased heterogeneity in study samples, requiring further specificity
   in detection and measurement of intermediate phenotypes and treatment
   Targets.}},

Abstract = {{Spaceborne radiometry plays a major role in weather and climate science
   and applications. Intercalibrating different radiometers has become an
   indispensable task for diagnosing instrument performance and integrating
   constellation data to extend the observational record. Because
   intercalibration affects both base radiance data and downstream science
   products, it is critical to examine intercalibration performance. In
   this study, we use constellation radiometer data from the Global
   Precipitation Measurement mission to detect and characterize a
   pronounced variability in intercalibration stability with a similar to
   40day periodicity. A regional dependence of the calibration is also
   found. The variability is related to geophysical parameters including
   water vapor, surface wind speed, and sea surface temperature. It is
   found that the variability is caused by periodic variations in the local
   times and locations of the overlap regions between spacecraft. An
   analytical orbit model is developed for calculating the period of
   oscillation and agrees well with observation. Calibration errors show
   nonlinear and nonmonotonic dependences on geophysical parameters and
   brightness temperature, which cannot be removed by simple linear
   regression. The variability affects both base radiance calibration
   accuracy and retrieved science data products.}},

Abstract = {{Implosions of planar wire arrays were performed on the Michigan
   Accelerator for Inductive Z-pinch Experiments, a linear transformer
   driver (LTD) at the University of Michigan. These experiments were
   characterized by lower than expected peak currents and significantly
   longer rise-times compared to studies performed on higher impedance
   machines. A circuit analysis showed that the load inductance has a
   significant impact on the current output due to the comparatively low
   impedance of the driver; the long risetimes were also attributed to high
   variability in LTD switch closing times. A circuit model accounting for
   these effects was employed to measure changes in load inductance as a
   function of time to determine plasma pinch timing and calculate a
   minimum effective current-carrying radius. These calculations showed
   good agreement with available shadowgraphy and x-ray diode measurements.

Abstract = {{In this research, we generated helical instability modes using unseeded
   and kink-seeded, non-imploding liner-plasmas at the 1 MA Linear
   Transformer Driver facility at the University of Michigan in order to
   determine the effects of externally applied, axial magnetic fields. In
   order to minimize the coupling of sausage and helical modes to the
   magneto Rayleigh-Taylor instability, the 400 nm-thick aluminum liners
   were placed directly around straight-cylindrical (unseeded) or
   threaded-cylindrical (kink-seeded) support structures to prevent
   implosion. The evolution of the instabilities was imaged using a
   combination of laser shadowgraphy and visible self-emission, collected
   by a 12-frame fast intensified CCD camera. With no axial magnetic field,
   the unseeded liners developed an azimuthally correlated m = 0 sausage
   instability (m is the azimuthal mode number). Applying a small external
   axial magnetic field of 1.1 T (compared to peak azimuthal field of 30 T)
   generated a smaller amplitude, helically oriented instability structure
   that is interpreted as an m = +2 helical mode. The kink-seeded liners
   showed highly developed helical structures growing at the seeded
   wavelength of lambda = 1.27 mm. It was found that the direction of the
   axial magnetic field played an important role in determining the overall
   stabilization effects; modes with helices spiraling in the opposite
   direction of the global magnetic field showed the strongest
   stabilization. Finally, the Weis-Zhang analytic theory {[}Weis et al.,
   Phys. Plasmas 22, 032706 (2015)] is used to calculate sausage and
   helical growth rates for experimental parameters in order to study the
   effects of axial magnetic fields. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Fabrication of NiTi through additive manufacturing: A review}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{630-663}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Nickel-titanium (NiTi) is an attractive alloy due to its unique
   functional properties (i.e., shape memory effect and superelasticity
   behaviors), low stiffness, biocompatibility, damping characteristics,
   and corrosion behavior. It is however a hard task to fabricate NiTi
   parts because of the high reactivity and high ductility of the alloy
   which results in difficulties in the processing and machining. These
   challenges altogether have limited the starting form of NiTi devices to
   simple geometries including rod, wire, bar, tube, sheet, and strip. In
   recent years, additive manufacturing (AM) techniques have been
   implemented for the direct production of complex NiTi such as
   lattice-based and hollow structures with the potential use in aerospace
   and medical applications. It worth noting that due to the relatively
   higher cost, AM is considered a supplement technique for the existing.
   This paper provides a comprehensive review of the publications related
   to the AM techniques of NiTi while highlighting current challenges and
   methods of solving them. To this end, the properties of conventionally
   fabricated NiTi are compared with those of AM fabricated alloys. The
   critical steps toward a successful manufacturing such as powder
   preparation, optimum laser parameters, and fabrication chamber
   conditions are explained. The microstructural characteristics and
   structural defects, the influencing factors on the transformation
   temperatures, and functional properties of NiTi are highlighted to
   provide and overview of the influencing factors and possible controlling
   methods. The mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance,
   compressive behaviors, fatigue characteristics, damping and shock
   absorption properties are also reported. A case study in the form of
   using AM as a promising technique to fabricate engineered porous NiTi
   for the purpose of creating a building block for medical applications is
   introduced. The paper concludes with a section that summarizes the main
   findings from the literature and outlines the trend for future research
   in the AM processing of NiTi. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Prototropic and solvatochromatic properties of fluorescein (FL) were
   employed to detect the presence of microenvironments in polyplexes
   consisting of polycationic polymer (POCP) and a fluorescein-conjugated
   RNA, the HIV-1 transactivation response element (TAR-FL). Results reveal
   new aspects of polyplex structure with respect to polyplex-bound RNA
   existing in the following local microenvironments: (a) RNA associated
   with the polyplex that experiences local pH changes in a manner
   dependent on POCP nitrogen to RNA phosphate ratio (N:P), (b) RNA
   experiencing relatively acidic local pH environment that remains
   constant in polyplexes formed after a charge-neutral ratio, and (c) RNA
   packed close enough to mediate fluorophore/fluorophore quenching. The
   magnitude of these changes observed as a function of POCP to nucleic
   acid N:P ratio is polymer dependent. Assessment of the different
   microenvironments can help elucidate the functional hierarchy of
   polyplex-bound oligonucleotides and additionally characterize POCPs

Abstract = {{Cholesterol reacted over 5 wt \% Pt/C, 5 wt \% Pd/C, and HZSM-5 in
   supercritical water at 400 degrees C. The major products with the Pt/C
   and Pd/C catalysts are cholesterobderived steroids, polynuclear aromatic
   compounds, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and gases (H-2, CH4, and C2H6),
   resulting from hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and cracking reactions.
   HZSM-5 favored initial dehydration of cholesterol to form
   cholesta-3,5-diene and then catalyzed further isomerization and cracking
   reactions. The presence of H-2 had little or no effect, except when the
   catalyst was absent, in which case added H-2 led to higher cholestadiene
   yields and lower cholesterol, conversion. Increasing the catalyst
   loading resulted in higher yields of lower Molecular weight products but

Abstract = {{In this paper, finite element analyses are employed to obtain the stress
   intensity factor solutions for similar and dissimilar welds in lap-shear
   specimens under pinned and clamped loading conditions. Analytical
   solutions for welds in lap-shear specimens under clamped loading
   conditions are then derived based on the energy release rate and the
   structural stress approaches. Both computational and analytical
   solutions indicate that the clamped loading reduces the stress intensity
   factor solutions for a given specimen geometry by about 7\% for similar
   welds and by about 20\% for dissimilar aluminum/steel and

Abstract = {{Cryopreservation and transplantation of ovarian tissue has proved to be
   a promising technique to safeguard fertility in cancer patients.
   However, with some types of cancer, there is a risk of transmitting
   malignant cells present in the cryopreserved tissue, so transplantation
   after disease remission is not advisable. To restore fertility in these
   patients, some research teams have been developing a transplantable
   artificial ovary, whose main goal is to mimic the natural organ. It
   should be composed of a matrix that encapsulates and protects follicles,
   as well as ovarian cells, which are necessary for follicle survival and
   development. This article reviews progress made in the creation of a
   transplantable artificial ovary and discusses future trends for its

Abstract = {{To accurately characterize shielded special nuclear materials (SNM)
   using passive gamma-ray spectroscopy measurement techniques, the
   effective atomic number and the thickness of shielding materials must be
   measured. Intervening materials between the source and detector may
   affect the estimated source isotopics (uranium enrichment and plutonium
   grade) for techniques which rely on raw count rates or photopeak ratios
   of gamma-ray lines separated in energy. Furthermore, knowledge of the
   surrounding materials can provide insight regarding the configuration of
   a device containing SNM. The described method was developed using
   spectra recorded using high energy resolution CdZnTe detectors, but can
   be expanded to any gamma-ray spectrometers with energy resolution of
   better than 1\% FWHM at 662 keV. The effective atomic number, Z, and
   mass thickness of the intervening shielding material are identified by
   comparing the relative attenuation of different gamma-ray lines and
   estimating the proportion of Compton scattering interactions to
   photoelectric absorptions within the shield. While characteristic
   K-alpha x-rays can be used to identify shielding materials made of high
   Z elements, this method can be applied to all shielding materials. This
   algorithm has adequately estimated the effective atomic number for
   shields made of iron, aluminum, and polyethylene surrounding uranium
   samples using experimental data. The mass thicknesses of shielding
   materials have been estimated with a standard error of less than 1.3
   g/cm(2) for iron shields up to 2.5 cm thick. The effective atomic number
   was accurately estimated to 26 +/- 5 for all iron thicknesses.}},

Abstract = {{Special nuclear material (SNM) monitoring often requires high resolution
   gamma-ray spectroscopy for material characterization. Portable systems
   and rapid deployment are also highly valued for some applications.
   Deployable gamma-ray imaging spectrometers using pixelated CdZnTe
   semiconductor detectors have become commercially available within the
   past three years to meet these requirements. CdZnTe systems have
   demonstrated room-temperature energy resolutions below 0.5\% FWHM at 662
   keV using single pixel events and below 0.7\% FWHM at 662 keV using all
   events. The systems are able to go from storage to measurement in less
   than two minutes. Special nuclear materials were measured at the Y-12
   National Security Complex and at the Device Assembly Facility at the
   Nevada National Security Site. The use of a CdZnTe system to measure
   uranium enrichment was demonstrated and uranium spectral features were
   compared to a commercially available high purity germanium (HPGe)
   spectrometer. The use of passive gamma-ray spectroscopy techniques to
   estimate plutonium grade using CdZnTe detectors was demonstrated for the

Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{3106-3113}},

Abstract = {{During each step of human walking, the swing foot passes close to the
   ground with a small but (usually) non-zero clearance. The foot can
   occasionally scuff against the ground, with some risk of stumbling or
   tripping. The risk might be mitigated simply by lifting the foot higher,
   but presumably at increased effort, of unknown amount. Perhaps the
   normally preferred ground clearance is a trade-off between competing
   costs, one for lifting the foot higher and one for scuffing it. We
   tested this by measuring the metabolic energy cost of lifting and
   scuffing the foot, treating these apparently dissimilar behaviors as
   part of a single continuum, where scuffing is a form of negative foot
   lift. We measured young, healthy adults (N=9) lifting or scuffing the
   foot by various amounts mid-swing during treadmill walking, and observed
   substantial costs, each well capable of doubling the net metabolic rate
   for normal walking (gross cost minus that for standing). In relative
   terms, the cost for scuffing increased over twice as steeply as that for
   lifting. That relative difference means that the expected value of cost,
   which takes into account movement variability, occurs at a non-zero mean
   clearance, approximately matching the preferred clearance we observed.
   Energy cost alone is only a lower bound on the overall disadvantages of
   inadvertent ground contact, but it is sufficient to show how human
   behavior may be determined not only by the separate costs of different
   trade-offs but also by movement variability, which can influence the
   average cost actually experienced in practice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a high-throughput method that relies upon a

   high-speed real-time imaging technology to describe the rate of
   coaggregation over time. The results of visual, microplate, and FlowCam
   (TM) aggregation scores for oral bacteria Streptococcus gordonii,
   Streptococcus oralis, and Actinomyces oris, whose ability to coaggregate
   are well characterized, are compared. Following mixing of all possible
   pairs, the top fraction of the supernatant was added to a microplate to
   quantify cell-density. Pairs were also passed through a flow cell within
   a FlowCam (TM) to quantify the rate of coaggregation of each pair.
   Results from both the microplate and FlowCam (TM) approaches correlated
   with corresponding visual coaggregation scores and microscopic
   observations. The microplate-based assay enables high-throughput
   screening, whereas the FlowCam (TM)-based assay validates and quantifies
   the extent that autoaggregation and coaggregation occur. Together these
   assays open the door for future in-depth studies of autoaggregation and
   coaggregation among large panels of test strains.}},

Abstract = {{The coarse-mesh finite difference (CMFD) method is one of the most
   widely used methods for accelerating the convergence of numerical
   transport solutions. However, in some situations, iterative methods
   using CMFD can become unstable and fail to converge. We present and
   evaluate three different modifications of the CMFD scheme that provide
   enhanced stability: multiple transport sweeps, artificial diffusion, and
   relaxing the flux update. We present the Fourier analysis on each of
   these schemes for an idealized problem to characterize the stability and
   rate of convergence for both fixed-source and fission source problems.
   Comparisons of the effectiveness of these methods are also performed
   numerically for a variety of benchmark boiling water reactor and
   pressurized water reactor problems using the Consortium for Advanced
   Simulation of Light Water Reactors neutronics code MPACT. We demonstrate
   a means of stabilizing CMFD by modifying the diffusion coefficient to
   make the iteration behave more like the partial-current CMFD (pCMFD)
   method, which is unconditionally stable, and show through a sequence of
   numerical experiments that the CMFD method performs similarly to the
   pCMFD method for the selected benchmark problems. We also show, both
   theoretically and experimentally, that modifying the diffusion
   coefficient in the CMFD equations is similar to underrelaxing the scalar
   flux update. The theoretical and experimental results show that many of
   the known techniques for stabilizing CMFD are fundamentally very closely
   related.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{829}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The origin and acceleration of the solar wind are still debated. In this
   paper,. we search for signatures of the source region and acceleration
   mechanism of the solar wind in the plasma properties measured in situ by
   the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft. Using the elemental
   abundances as a proxy for the source region and the differential
   velocity and ion temperature ratios as a proxy for the acceleration
   mechanism, we are able to identify signatures pointing toward possible
   source regions and acceleration mechanisms. We find that the fast solar
   wind in the ecliptic plane is the same as that observed from the polar
   regions and is consistent with wave acceleration and coronal-hole
   origin. We also find that the slow wind is composed of two components:
   one similar to the fast solar wind (with slower velocity) and the other
   likely originating from closed magnetic loops. Both components of the
   slow solar wind show signatures of wave acceleration. From these
   findings, we draw a scenario that envisions two types of wind, with
   different source regions and release mechanisms, but the same wave
   acceleration mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{THE CAPABILITIES OF modern medical devices continue to radically
   transform the treatment of acute conditions as well as the management of
   chronic long-term disease. As these technologies evolve, so also do the
   threats to the security and reliability of these devices. Over the past
   decade, there has been no shortage of headlines warning of pacemaker
   turned peacemaker, or insulin assassinations. Although these taglines
   are fictional (but not unimaginable), they capture the tenor of much of
   the medical device security reportage. While we strongly affirm the
   necessity of public awareness of these issues, we believe that hyperbole
   and/or mischaracterizations may lead to panic, desensitization, or
   perhaps worse, exploitation.
   Today, attention is turning to the dangers posed by the omnipresent
   cyber threat, as signaled with the long- awaited release on Oct. 2, 2014
   of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on the management of
   cybersecurity in medical devices, 7 and the more recent draft guidance
   of Postmarket Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices. 8
   Therefore, as the human body joins the illustrious Internet of Things,
   it is constructive to take pause and see how we got here. We hope this
   brief chronology of medical device and health IT security helps provide
   context for the current state of medical device security.}},

Abstract = {{While real-time sensor feeds have the potential to transform both
   environmental science and decision making, such data are rarely part of
   real-time workflows, analyses and modeling tool chains. Despite benefits
   ranging from detecting malfunctioning sensors to adaptive sampling, the
   limited number and complexity of existing real-time platforms across
   environmental domains pose a barrier to the adoption of real-time data.
   We present an architecture built upon 1) the increasing availability of
   new technologies to expose environmental sensors as web services, and 2)
   the merging of these services under recent innovations on the Internet
   of Things (IoT). By leveraging recent developments in the IoT arena, the
   environmental sciences stand to make significant gains in the use of
   real-time data. We describe a use case in the hydrologic sciences, where
   an adaptive sampling algorithm is successfully deployed to optimize the

Abstract = {{Biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is ubiquitous in the Earth's
   atmosphere, influencing climate and air quality. However, the historical
   trend of biogenic SOA is not well known. Here, we report for the first
   time the major isoprene- and monoterpene-derived SOA tracers preserved
   in an ice core from the Kamchatka Peninsula. Significant variations are
   recorded during the past 300 years with lower concentrations in the
   early-to-middle 19th century and higher concentrations in the
   preindustrial period and the present day. We discovered that isoprene
   SOA tracers were more abundant in the preindustrial period than the
   present day, while monoterpene SOA tracers stay almost unchanged. The
   causes of the observed variability are complex, depending on atmospheric
   circulation, changes in emissions, and other factors such as
   tropospheric oxidative capacity. Our data presents an unprecedented
   opportunity to shed light on the formation, evolution, and fate of
   atmospheric aerosols and to constrain the uncertainties associated with

Abstract = {{Part I of this study has identified two key parameters (tit ratio and
   characteristic heat input (Q) over cap) that dominate important
   through-thickness residual stress distribution characteristics, with
   which a residual stress profile estimation scheme has been developed for
   weld region, i.e., at weld centerline and weld toe. In Part II, we
   present an analytical model for achieving residual stress profile
   estimation for through thickness sections away from the weld region in
   seam welded pipe and vessel components. A curved beam bending theory
   based model is analytically constructed through an assembly of two
   parts: One is weld fusion zone region and the other is the rest of the
   component section along circumferential direction. The final assembly of
   the two parts leads to a closed form solution to both axial
   (longitudinal) and hoop (transverse) residual stress components as a
   function of circumferential angular position away from weld toe. The
   effectiveness of the full-field residual stress estimation scheme is
   demonstrated by comparing with finite element modeling results over a
   broad range of weld geometries and welding conditions. The present
   development should provide a consistent and effective means for
   estimating through-thickness residual stress profile as a continuous
   function of pipe geometry and welding heat input. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A recent comprehensive investigation into residual stress distributions
   in pipe and vessel longitudinal seam welds is presented in this paper,
   covering component wall thickness from 1/4{''} (6.35 mm) to 10{''} (254
   mm), component radius to wall thickness ratio from 2 to 20, and linear
   welding heat input from low (50 J/mm) to high (6000 J/mm). Through the
   use of a residual stress decomposition technique, two key parameters
   that govern through-thickness residual stress distributions in terms of
   their membrane and bending content have been identified. One is
   component radius to wall thickness ratio (r/t) and the other is a
   characteristic heat input density ((Q) over cap) having a unit of
   J/mm(3). With these two parameters, a unified functional form for
   estimating through-thickness residual stress profile in seam welded
   components is proposed in this paper (Part I) for supporting fitness for
   service assessment for crack-like flaws in weld region. A curved beam
   bending theory based model is introduced in Part II as a means of
   analytically describing through-thickness residual stress profile as a
   function of circumferential position away from the weld region until
   residual stresses become zero. The effectiveness of this proposed
   framework for achieving residual stress profile estimation within weld
   region (Part I) for longitudinal seam welds in pressure vessel and
   piping components has been confirmed by finite element residual stress
   analysis results on a large number of component configurations and
   different welding conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Polyvinyl chloride as a multimodal tissue-mimicking material with tuned
   mechanical and medical imaging properties}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The mechanical and imaging properties of polyvinyl chloride
   (PVC) can be adjusted to meet the needs of researchers as a
   tissue-mimicking material. For instance, the hardness can be adjusted by
   changing the ratio of softener to PVC polymer, mineral oil can be added
   for lubrication in needle insertion, and glass beads can be added to
   scatter acoustic energy similar to biological tissue. Through this
   research, the authors sought to develop a regression model to design
   formulations of PVC with targeted mechanical and multimodal medical
   imaging properties.
   Methods: The design of experiment was conducted by varying three
   factors-(1) the ratio of softener to PVC polymer, (2) the mass fraction
   of mineral oil, and (3) the mass fraction of glass beads-and measuring
   the mechanical properties (elastic modulus, hardness, viscoelastic
   relaxation time constant, and needle insertion friction force) and the
   medical imaging properties {[}speed of sound, acoustic attenuation
   coefficient, magnetic resonance imaging time constants T-1 and T-2, and
   the transmittance of the visible light at wavelengths of 695 nm
   (T-lambda 695) and 532 nm (T-lambda 532)] on twelve soft PVC samples. A
   regression model was built to describe the relationship between the
   mechanical and medical imaging properties and the values of the three
   composition factors of PVC. The model was validated by testing the
   properties of a PVC sample with a formulation distinct from the twelve
   samples.
   Results: The tested soft PVC had elastic moduli from 6 to 45 kPa,
   hardnesses from 5 to 50 Shore OOO-S, viscoelastic stress relaxation time
   constants from 114.1 to 191.9 s, friction forces of 18 gauge needle
   insertion from 0.005 to 0.086 N/mm, speeds of sound from 1393 to 1407
   m/s, acoustic attenuation coefficients from 0.38 to 0.61 (dB/cm)/MHz,
   T-1 relaxation times from 426.3 to 450.2 ms, T-2 relaxation times from
   21.5 to 28.4 ms, T-lambda 695 from 46.8\% to 92.6\%, and T-lambda 532
   from 41.1\% to 86.3\%. Statistically significant factors of each
   property were identified. The regression model relating the mechanical
   and medical imaging properties and their corresponding significant
   factors had a good fit. The validation tests showed a small discrepancy
   between the model predicted values and experimental data (all less than
   5\% except the needle insertion friction force).
   Conclusions: The regression model developed in this paper can be used to
   design soft PVC with targeted mechanical and medical imaging properties.

   graphene was often created using graphene oxide. In our approach, we
   functionalized a CVD graphene sheet and -COOH groups can be conjugated

Title = {{The consequences of air flow on the distribution of aqueous species
   during dielectric barrier discharge treatment of thin water layers}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The desired outcomes of wet tissue treatment by dielectric barrier
   discharges (DBDs) strongly depend on the integrated fluences of reactive
   species incident onto the tissue, which are determined by power,
   frequency and treatment time. The reactivity produced by such plasmas is
   often expected to be proportional to treatment time due to the
   accumulation of radicals in the liquid over the tissue. However, one of
   the typically uncontrolled parameters in DBD treatment of liquids and
   tissue is gas flow, which could affect the delivery of plasma produced
   radicals to the tissue. Gas flow can redistribute long-lived, plasma
   produced gas phase species prior to solvating in the liquid, while not
   greatly affecting the solvation of short-lived species. Gas flow can
   therefore potentially be a control mechanism for tailoring the fluences
   of reactive species to the tissue. In this paper, we report on a
   computational investigation of the consequences of gas flow on treatment
   of liquid layers covering tissue by atmospheric DBDs by up to 100
   pulses. We found that gas flow (through residence time of the gas) can
   control the production of gas phase species requiring many collisions to
   form, such as reactive nitrogen species (RNS). The resulting solvation
   of the RNS in turn controls the production of aqueous species such as
   NO3aq- and ONOOaq- (aq denotes an aqueous species). With the exception
   of O-3 and O-3aq, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are less sensitive to
   gas flow, and so OHaq and H2O2aq, are determined primarily by discharge
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Despite significant advances in 3D biomaterial printing, the potential
   of 3D printing for patient specific implants and tissue reconstruction
   has not been fully exploited. This is due in part to the lack of
   integration of image-based patient specific design with 3D biomaterial
   printing within a relevant regulatory framework, namely design control,
   required by the FDA. In this manuscript, we describe the integration of
   image-based, multiscale patient specific design with 3D biomaterial
   printing within a design control framework for clinical translation.
   Specifically, we define design inputs for patient specific implants and
   scaffolds, and utilize image-based patient specific design to achieve
   these design inputs. We then illustrate realization of these topology
   designed patient specific implants by laser sintering of
   polycaprolactone (PCL). Finally, we present initial results in large
   animal models using 3D printed PCL implants addressing two challenging
   problems in tissue reconstruction: 1) designing and 3D printing
   implantable devices to allow growth in pediatric airway applications and
   2) utilizing 3D printed scaffolds as foundations for prefabricated flaps
   to obtain vascularization and bone formation for large volume bone/soft
   tissue reconstruction. We illustrate these challenging problems as they
   need to be incorporated in design control, but as of yet there are few
   data to direct how growth and vascularization should be utilized in
   design control.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on an active SLAM framework for performing
   large-scale inspections with an underwater robot. We propose a path
   planning algorithm integrated with visual SLAM that plans loop-closure
   paths in order to decrease navigation uncertainty. While loop-closing
   revisit actions bound the robot's uncertainty, they also lead to
   redundant area coverage and increased path length. Our proposed
   opportunistic framework leverages sampling-based techniques and
   information filtering to plan revisit paths that are coverage efficient.
   We employ Gaussian process regression for modeling the prediction of
   camera registrations and use a two-step optimization procedure for
   selecting revisit actions. We show that the proposed method offers many
   benefits over existing solutions and good performance for bounding
   navigation uncertainty in long-term autonomous operations with hybrid
   simulation experiments and real-world field trials performed by an
   underwater inspection robot.}},

Abstract = {{A strong and broadband negative group delay (NGD) is demonstrated in a
   circular waveguide with an asymmetric cross-shaped slotted structure in
   the millimeter-wave region. For an input of 45 degrees linear
   polarization (relative to the orientation of the cross-shaped slots),
   the NGD fractional bandwidth is as high as 3.57\%, in which the optimal
   group advancement obtained is nearly 24 times greater than the delay
   traveling with the speed of light in vacuum. This further indicates a
   very high fractional advancement of 12.10\%. In addition, the NGD can be
   controlled by adjusting the polarization azimuthal angle of the incident
   pulse. The observed tunable NGD effect is attributed to the destructive
   cross interference between the two polarization eigenstates, which
   effectively reduces the released field energy at the observed
   polarization channel. A general theory is provided with excellent
   agreement in the experimental and simulation results.}},

   Water Quality}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Managers and regulators need to determine the feasibility of expanding
   aquaculture in freshwater and marine systems without endangering the
   environment or compromising water-quality goals. Models for various
   aquaculture operations and receiving water responses have been developed
   and applied by previous researchers. However, these models should be
   combined into a single, unified framework prior to management
   applications. This paper demonstrates for the first time how various
   submodels can be integrated and used to calculate the impacts of
   aquaculture on river water quality. A fish bioenergetics submodel
   simulates fish growth, production, and by-product nutrient loading as a
   function of fish numbers, feeding rate, food composition, and
   temperature. A receiving water submodel simulates water-quality impacts
   as a function of the aquaculture by-product nutrient loading and the
   physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the stream or
   river. The utility of the approach and proof of concept is demonstrated
   by examining the impacts of a hypothetical aquaculture operation on one
   of the United States' most renowned, high-quality recreational trout
   fisheries, the Au Sable River (Michigan). This framework is used to
   evaluate the water-quality impacts of alternative fish production levels
   and quantify how careful control of ration and low phosphorus-content
   feed can reduce by-product nutrient loads. The model can also calculate
   how wastewater treatment can be used to increase the probability of
   attaining compliance when conscientious aquaculture management practices
   alone are insufficient to meet water-quality goals. Issues related to
   model reliability and validation are discussed and recommendations for
   future research and development are suggested. (C) 2016 American Society

Abstract = {{Dynamic wireless power transfer (WPT) is a practical method to solve
   electric vehicle (EV) range anxiety and reduce the cost of on-board
   batteries. This paper presents a novel dynamic WPT system that combines
   the advantages of pads array and segmental long coils coupler. In the
   proposed circuit, several paralleled LCC reactive power compensation
   networks (RPCNs) in the primary side were excited by a sole inverter and
   the power distribution was realized automatically; an auxiliary LCC
   network was proposed to regulate current in the primary coil to minimize
   the electromagnetic interference (EMI) and reduce the system's power
   loss. A scaled-down prototype of a dynamic wireless charging system was
   developed to prove the validity of the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a continuous dynamic wireless power transfer system
   for electric vehicles that reduces power pulsations during the charging
   process. Multiple rectangular unipolar coils are used at the primary
   side as the transmitters, and another unipolar coil works as a receiver
   at the secondary side. The transmitters are placed closely together to
   reduce the variation of magnetic fields along the moving track of the
   receiver. This structure induces self-coupling between the adjacent
   transmitters. AnLCC-compensated circuit topology is utilized, and a
   compensation parameter design is provided which considers self-coupling
   between the primary coils. Finite-element analysis of the dynamic
   charging system is performed using Maxwell. The receiver size is
   optimized to reduce the variation of the coupling coefficient. A 1.4-kW
   dynamic charging prototype is constructed according to the designed coil
   structure and circuit parameters. There are six transmitters, each with
   dimensions 388 mmx400 mm, and one receiver with dimensions 485 mmx400
   mm. Experimental results show that the output power pulsation is within
   +/- 7.5\% in the dynamic charging process, and the maximum efficiency is
   89.78\%. If the edge effects of the transmitters are neglected, then the
   power pulsation is within +/- 2.9\%.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses the feasibility of using a single-span bridge as a
   weigh-in-motion (WIM) tool to quantify the gross vehicle weights (GVWs)
   of trucks inexpensively with a small number of sensors and without using
   axle detectors. Field testing was performed on an interstate without any
   lane closures. Four preweighed trucks with different axle configurations
   traveled over a bridge at three different speeds and in two separate
   lanes. Measured strain data were used to implement bridge
   weigh-in-motion (B-WIM) algorithms and calculate the corresponding
   velocities and GVWs. A comparison was made between calculated and actual
   measured static weights, and between the calculated and specified speeds
   of the trucks. In addition to field testing, a finite-element (FE) model
   of the tested bridge was created and calibrated based on the measured
   strains at different locations. This calibrated FE model enabled the
   acquisition of the influence values for the bridge at any location
   (influence surface). Ten different points were selected to calculate the
   influence surface values, and a comparison was made between calculated
   strains from the influence surface and the actual response of the bridge
   recorded by strain gauges. The comparison showed that the updated FE
   model was capable of providing the influence surface values at different
   locations. The validated influence surfaces were then used to simulate
   the passing of common types of trucks with various weights and axle
   configurations over the bridge. The measured GVWs based on simulated
   strain measurements provided by the FE model and validated influence
   surfaces verified the applied method. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES}},

Abstract = {{The current state of the national bridge infrastructure network
   highlights the need for solutions to mitigate the evolution of
   deterioration, but also the need to develop innovative solutions to
   evaluate conditions on regular intervals. Solutions to this evaluation
   challenge need to be cost-effective and not interrupt traffic, but also
   need to align with current assessment strategies for adoption. The
   concept of remote sensing applied to transportation infrastructure
   evaluation presents a viable option, as the tools are noninvasive and
   can be used to provide analogous information to that which is typically
   collected through standard evaluation practices. This paper presents the
   results of a field study focusing on the deployment of commercially
   available remote sensing technologies for evaluating in-service bridges.
   The selected remote sensing technologies were used on three concrete
   bridges in the State of Michigan to evaluate the capabilities of each
   technology and their ability to provide condition measurements
   comparable to those derived from traditional hands-on inspection
   practices typical for in-service bridges. Results from the field study
   highlight that these technologies do provide comparable and even more
   comprehensive condition measurements in a more efficient manner than
   standard practice, but also highlights the need for the fusion of
   measurement techniques to provide a more robust condition assessment.

   by monitoring the lowest symmetrical mode S-0 of a Lamb wave in the
   range of 142-458 MHz. We evaluated the response of the acoustic devices
   by monitoring the amplitude and phase of the wave during the application
   of various concentrations of glycerol on the device surface. In
   addition, we demonstrated a strong correlation between mass sensitivity
   and device operating frequency, as measured during the specific binding
   of biotinylated IgG on the neutravidin modified membrane. Importantly,
   our results indicate that a decisive parameter in choosing the optimum
   frequency is the nature of the final application. Lower operating
   frequencies (<200 MHz) appear to be more suitable for viscosity
   measurements, while higher ones (similar to 300 MHz) should be selected
   for biosensing applications.}},

Abstract = {{Human occupancy detection and localization are important in a variety of
   smart building applications including building security, assisted living
   monitors, and energy-efficient heating ventilation and air cooling and
   lighting. Current implementation of such systems is limited by
   motion-sensor technologies, e.g., passive infrared (PIR) and ultrasonic
   sensors, which substitute as occupancy detectors but ultimately suffer
   from an inability to detect stationary objects. Capacitive sensing can
   detect stationary objects, but the technology has almost exclusively
   been developed for short-range human detection and localization, e.g.,
   touch-screen human interfacing of smart devices. This paper presents a
   transmitter-receiver platform for research and development of capacitive
   sensing for long-range human occupancy detection and localization.
   During testing, the system revealed a detection range of 3.5 m, a
   typical room dimension in homes. Further, tests of a multitransmitter
   single-receiver system in a 3.2 m x 3.2 m space showed the system's
   potential for occupant localization. Ultimately, this system represents
   an alternative to PIR and ultrasonic motion sensors, and has the
   potential to increase smart building system implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The following problem is addressed: `Can one synthesize microstructure
   evolution over a large area given experimental movies measured over

   a small sample window. A Markov random field (MRF) algorithm is
   developed that uses this data to estimate the evolution of
   microstructure over a larger region. Unlike the standard microstructure
   reconstruction problem based on stationary images, the present algorithm
   is also able to reconstruct time-evolving phenomena such as grain
   growth. Such an algorithm would decrease the cost of full-scale
   microstructure measurements by coupling mathematical estimation with
   targeted small-scale spatiotemporal measurements. The grain size, shape
   and orientation distribution statistics of synthesized polycrystalline
   microstructures at different times are compared with the original movie
   to verify the method.}},

Journal = {{PLASMA PHYSICS AND CONTROLLED FUSION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Laser-wakefield accelerators (LWFAs) were proposed more than three
   decades ago, and while they promise to deliver compact, high energy
   particle accelerators, they will also provide the scientific community
   with novel light sources. In a LWFA, where an intense laser pulse
   focused onto a plasma forms an electromagnetic wave in its wake,
   electrons can be trapped and are now routinely accelerated to GeV
   energies. From terahertz radiation to gamma-rays, this article reviews
   light sources from relativistic electrons produced by LWFAs, and
   discusses their potential applications. Betatron motion, Compton
   scattering and undulators respectively produce x-rays or gamma-rays by
   oscillating relativistic electrons in the wakefield behind the laser
   pulse, a counter-propagating laser field, or a magnetic undulator. Other
   LWFA-based light sources include bremsstrahlung and terahertz radiation.
   We first evaluate the performance of each of these light sources, and
   compare them with more conventional approaches, including radio
   frequency accelerators or other laser-driven sources. We have then
   identified applications, which we discuss in details, in a broad range
   of fields: medical and biological applications, military, defense and
   industrial applications, and condensed matter and high energy density

Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{148}},
Pages = {{12-27}},

Abstract = {{Further increasing grain production and rural household income is a
   major challenge for rural development in China, and the current small
   scale of farming operations is an important factor limiting progress on
   both. The Chinese central government's recent approach to promoting
   rural development addresses the role of land rental markets in
   facilitating larger-scale farming operations. We use an agent-based
   model that represents livelihood decision-making of rural households to
   explore the effects of an alternative policy that subsidizes rural
   households that rent out their land-use rights for long terms in
   comparison with the current policy of subsidizing grain producers. The
   model is built upon our empirical analysis of social surveys and
   interviews in eight villages around Poyang Lake. We consider policy
   impacts in terms of economic performance and equality. The modeling
   results suggest that policy responses differ considerably between
   villages with poor, average, and good farmland resources, and the
   rental-subsidy policy is expected to be most effective at stimulating
   land rental markets in villages with average farmland resources. The
   rental subsidies are likely to move the agricultural system to a more
   productive state with more growth potential and less cost in most
   places. The rental-subsidy policy can also make every household in
   farmland-poor places better off and may be used to further address
   inequality in farmland resources. However, both policies show limited
   effects on increasing rural income, suggesting rural development will
   continue to depend on urbanization. We discuss how the government may
   use the rental subsidy as an instrument to facilitate urbanization to
   best benefit all rural households. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{25}},
Pages = {{3501-3514}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a novel method for structural damage assessment
   based on the electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique applied to
   composite structures. This method is based on a high-frequency
   excitation range in order to overcome the difficulties caused when the
   low vibration modes are excited. A structure made up of unidirectional
   carbon fiber pre-impregnated with resin-epoxy is excited using a chirp
   signal which varies the frequency in a wide range through the PZT (Lead
   Zirconate Titanate) patches. From the structural response signal, the
   Euclidean Distance (ED) is computed from each structural condition
   considering the pristine condition as a reference (baseline). The ED is
   used as input to the Simplified Fuzzy ARTMAP Network (SFAN) which is
   responsible for identifying various different structural conditions. It
   is shown that the robustness provided by SFAN allows the evaluation of
   the progress of structural damage even under critical conditions. The
   structural damage was simulated by loosening bolts in a structure.
   Furthermore, the repaired condition was also considered by retightening
   bolts. The paper discusses the advantages and drawbacks of the approach
   in light of the experimental results.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},

Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Concept generation techniques can help to support designers in
   generating multiple ideas during design tasks. However, differences in
   the ways these techniques guide idea generation are not well understood.
   This study investigated the qualities of concepts generated by beginning
   engineering designers using one of three different idea generation
   techniques. Working individually on an open-ended engineering design
   problem, 102 first year engineering students learned and applied one of
   three different ideation techniques-design heuristics, morphological
   analysis, or individual brainstorming (using brainstorming rules to
   generate ideas working alone)-to a given design problem. Using the
   consensual assessment technique, all concepts were rated for creativity,
   elaboration, and practicality, and all participants' concept sets were
   rated for quantity and diversity. The simplest technique, individual
   brainstorming, led to the most concepts within the short (25 minute)
   ideation session. All three techniques produced creative concepts
   averaging near the scale midpoint. The elaboration of the concepts was
   significantly higher with design heuristics and morphological analysis
   techniques, and the practicality was significantly higher using design
   heuristics. Controlling for number of concepts generated, there were no
   significant differences in diversity of solution sets across groups.
   These results demonstrate that the use of design heuristics does not
   limit the creativity of ideation outcomes, and helps students to develop
   more elaborate and practical ideas. Design heuristics show advantages in
   the initial idea generation phase for beginning engineering students.
   These findings point to specific strengths in different ideation
   techniques, and the value of exposing beginning designers to multiple
   techniques for idea generation.}},

Abstract = {{Developing offshore wind energy has become more and more serious
   worldwide in recent years. Many of the promising offshore wind farm
   locations are in cold regions that may have ice cover during wintertime.
   The challenge of possible ice loads on offshore wind turbines raises the
   demand of modeling capacity of dynamic wind turbine response under the
   joint action of ice, wind, wave, and current. The simulation software
   FAST is an open source computer-aided engineering (CAE) package
   maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In this paper, a
   new module of FAST for assessing the dynamic response of offshore wind
   turbines subjected to ice forcing is presented. In the ice module,
   several models are presented which involve both prescribed forcing and
   coupled response. For conditions in which the ice forcing is essentially
   decoupled from the structural response, ice forces are established from
   existing models for brittle and ductile ice failure. For conditions in
   which the ice failure and the structural response are coupled, such as
   lock-in conditions, a rate-dependent ice model is described, which is
   developed in conjunction with a new modularization framework for FAST.
   In this paper, analytical ice mechanics models are presented that
   incorporate ice floe forcing, deformation, and failure. For lower
   speeds, forces slowly build until the ice strength is reached and ice
   fails resulting in a quasi-static condition. For intermediate speeds,
   the ice failure can be coupled with the structural response and
   resulting in coinciding periods of the ice failure and the structural
   response. A third regime occurs at high speeds of encounter in which
   brittle fracturing of the ice feature occurs in a random pattern, which
   results in a random vibration excitation of the structure. An example
   wind turbine response is simulated under ice loading of each of the
   presented models. This module adds to FAST the capabilities for
   analyzing the response of wind turbines subjected to forces resulting
   from ice impact on the turbine support structure. The conditions
   considered in this module are specifically addressed in the
   International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 19906:
   2010 for arctic offshore structures design consideration. Special
   consideration of lock-in vibrations is required due to the detrimental
   effects of such response with regard to fatigue and foundation/soil
   response. The use of FAST for transient, time domain simulation with the
   new ice module is well suited for such analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The electron injection process into a plasma-based laser wakefield
   accelerator can be influenced by modifying the parameters of the driver
   pulse. We present an experimental study on the combined effect of the
   laser pulse duration, pulse shape, and frequency chirp on the electron
   injection and acceleration process and the associated radiation emission
   for two different gas types-a 97.5\% He and 2.5\% N-2 mixture and pure
   He. In general, the shortest pulse duration with minimal frequency chirp
   produced the highest energy electrons and the most charge. Pulses on the
   positive chirp side sustained electron injection and produced higher
   charge, but lower peak energy electrons, compared with negatively
   chirped pulses. A similar trend was observed for the radiant energy. The
   relationship between the radiant energy and the electron charge remained
   linear over a threefold change in the electron density and was
   independent of the drive pulse characteristics. X-ray spectra showed
   that ionization injection of electrons into the wakefield generally
   produced more photons than self-injection for all pulse
   durations/frequency chirp and had less of a spread in the number of
   photons around the peak x-ray energy.}},

Title = {{Impact of paper and cardboard suppression on OFMSW anaerobic digestion}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{100-105}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical-biological treatment plants treat municipal solid waste to
   recover recyclable materials, nutrients and energy. Waste paper and
   cardboard (WP), the second main compound in municipal solid waste
   (similar to 30\% in weight basis), is typically used for biogas
   generation. However, its recovery is gaining attention as it can be used
   to produce add-value products like bioethanol and residual derived fuel.
   Nevertheless, WP suppression or replacement will impact anaerobic
   digestion in terms of biogas production, process stability and digestate
   management. Two lab-scale reactors were used to assess the impact of WP
   in anaerobic digestion performance. A control reactor was only fed with
   biowaste (BioW), while a second reactor was fed with two different
   mixtures of BioW and WP, i.e. 85/15\% and 70/30\% (weight basis).
   Results indicate that either replacing half of the WP by BioW or
   removing half of the WP has little impact on the methane production.
   When removing half of the WP, methane production could be sustained by a
   larger waste biodegradability. The replacement of all WP by BioW
   increased the reactor methane production (similar to 37\%), while
   removing all WP would have reduced the methane production about 15\%.
   Finally, replacing WP loading rate by BioW led to a system less tolerant
   to instability periods and with poorer digestate quality. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This work presents a new method for designing and evaluating different
   fleet paradigms to determine an effective and cost efficient solution.
   The method requires the user to define a set of functions which must be
   carried out by the fleet, as well as a set of candidate vehicles or
   systems that can carry out these functions. These function and fleet
   models are then evaluated to determine their performance. All the data
   is then fed into a stochastic dynamic fleet operation model to identify
   the amount of vehicles or systems needed to complete each mission
   defined on a fixed time horizon. The output of the fleet operation model
   is then used by cost models to determine the cost of completing each
   fleet mission. The overall approach is demonstrated on a military fleet
   composed of two different types of vehicle: a conventional fleet and a
   fleet composed of modules. The method shows the potential for savings
   using a modular fleet for a hypothetical fleet mission profile; more
   work in this area is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{A wave-based analytical method is applied to study vibrations in simple

   described as waves propagating along uniform structural elements and
   being reflected and transmitted at structural discontinuities. Coupled
   in- and out-of-plane bending, axial, and torsional vibrations are
   studied based on classical vibration theories. Both free and forced
   vibrations are studied. Natural frequencies, modeshapes, as well as
   frequency responses due to various external excitations are obtained.
   The results obtained using the wave vibration approach are verified both
   experimentally and through comparison to results available in the
   literature. Good agreements have been reached. This study provides not
   only exact analytical solutions to complex vibration problems in spatial
   structures that have mostly been relying on numerical tools, but also a
   benchmark to existing numerical solutions.}},

   understanding the underlying flow structures and their implications on
   energy production. Experimental studies by Dabiri (J Renew Sustain
   Energy 3, 2011) suggest that VAWTs demand less stringent spacing
   requirements than their horizontal axis counterparts and additional
   benefits may be obtained by optimizing the placement and rotational
   direction of VAWTs. The flowfield of pairs of co-/counter-rotating VAWTs
   shows some similarities with pairs of cylinders in terms of wake
   structure and vortex shedding. When multiple VAWTs are placed in a
   column, the extent of the wake is seen to spread further downstream,
   irrespective of the direction of rotation of individual turbines.
   However, the aerodynamic interference between turbines gives rise to
   regions of excess momentum between the turbines which lead to
   significant power augmentations. Studies of VAWTs arranged in multiple
   columns show that the downstream columns can actually be more efficient
   than the leading column, a proposition that could lead to radical
   improvements in wind farm productivity.}},

Title = {{Self-healing supramolecular bioelastomers with shape memory property as
   a multifunctional platform for biomedical applications via modular
   assembly}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{18-31}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Mimicking native functional dynamics for traditional biomaterials such
   as thermoset elastomers is limited due to their lack of responsiveness
   to biological stimuli and difficulties to incorporate
   biofunctionalities. Furthermore, the mechanical fracture of traditional
   thermoset elastomers caused by irreversible covalent bond rupture would
   lead to their permanent loss of properties. To overcome these
   challenges, degradable self-healed supramolecular bioelastomers are
   designed by an elastic poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) backbone and
   multiple hydrogen-bonding ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy) grafts. These
   supramolecular elastic polymers ``exhibit efficient self-healing, rapid
   shape-memory abilities and highly tunable mechanical properties due to
   the dynamic supramolecular interactions, and perform a good
   biocompatibility in vitro and a mild host response in vivo. By combining
   modular approaches, these supramolecular bioelastomers have been further
   assembled into a multifunctional platform to expand their applications
   in different biomedical fields. These include a complex 3D scaffold with
   shape-memory capacity and anisotropic mechanical properties, a
   controllable drug delivery model via a layer-by-layer technique, a
   surface antibacterial composite by physical modification, and a spatial
   oriented cell co-culture system via incorporating different cell-laden
   self-healing films, demonstrating their potential as building blocks in
   a wide range of biomedical applications where dynamic properties and
   biological functions are desired. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This experimental study investigates the direct tensile behavior of
   ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHP-FRC) at strain
   rates ranging from 90 to 146/s. The tests are conducted using a recently
   developed impact testing system that uses suddenly released strain
   energy to generate an impact pulse. Three fiber types were considered, a
   twisted fiber and two other types of straight fibers. Specimen impact
   response was evaluated in terms of first cracking strength,
   post-cracking strength, energy absorption capacity and strain capacity.
   The test results indicate that specimens with twisted fibers generally
   exhibit somewhat better mechanical properties than specimens with
   straight fibers for the range of strain rates considered. All UHP-FRC
   series tested showed exceptional rate sensitivities in energy absorption
   capacity, generally becoming much more energy dissipative under
   increasing strain rates. This characteristic highlights the potential of
   UHP-FRC as a promising cement based material for impact- and
   blast-resistant applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Scanning stages are used for precise positioning in a variety of
   advanced manufacturing processes, and must deliver high
   accelerations/decelerations at motion reversals to achieve high
   throughput. The resulting inertial forces cause excessive motor heating
   and residual vibration of the stage, both of which must be mitigated to
   preserve positioning accuracy. A novel scanning stage, having a
   permanent magnet based device that actively provides assist forces to
   the motor to simultaneously reduce motor heating and residual vibration,
   is presented. The active assist device is optimally designed to be
   versatile, allowing it to provide adequate assist for scan trajectories
   involving the widest range of scan strokes/positions. A
   basis-spline-based method is proposed for optimal control of the device,
   to maximize the assist it provides for scan trajectories with varying
   scan strokes/positions. Experiments conducted with a prototype stage
   involving scanning trajectories commonly employed in silicon wafer
   processing are used to demonstrate up to 60\% and 34\% reductions in
   heat and vibration-induced errors, respectively, when compared to cases
   without the proposed active assist device. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Investigation into the disparate origin of CO2 and H2O outgassing for
   Comet 67/P}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{277}},
Pages = {{78-97}},

Abstract = {{We present an investigation of the emission intensity of CO2 and H2O and
   their distribution in the coma of 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko obtained by
   the VIRTIS-M imaging spectrometer on the Rosetta mission. We analyze 4
   data cubes from Feb. 28, and 7 data cubes from April 27, 2015. For both
   data sets the spacecraft was at a sufficiently large distance from the
   comet to allow images of the whole nucleus and the surrounding coma.
   We find that unlike water which has a reasonably predictable behavior
   and correlates well with the solar illumination, CO2 outgasses mostly in
   local regions or spots. Furthermore for the data on April 27, the CO2
   evolves almost exclusively from the southern hemisphere, a region of the
   comet that has not received solar illumination since the comet's last
   perihelion passage. Because CO2 and H2O have such disparate origins,
   deriving mixing ratios from local column density measurements cannot
   provide a meaningful measurement of the CO2/H2O ratio in the coma of the
   comet. We obtain total production rates of H2O and CO2 by integrating
   the band intensity in an annulus surrounding the nucleus and obtain
   pro-forma production rate CO2/H2O mixing ratios of similar to 5.0\% and
   similar to 2.5\% for Feb. 28 and April 27, respectively. Because of the
   highly variable nature of the CO2 evolution from the surface we do not
   believe that these numbers are diagnostic of the comet's bulk CO2/H2O
   composition. We believe that our investigation provides an explanation
   for the large observed variations reported in the literature for the
   CO2/H2O production rate ratios. Our mixing ratio maps indicate that,
   besides the difference in vapor pressure of the two gases, this ratio
   depends on the comet's rotational orientation combined with its complex
   geometric shape which can result in quite variable rates of erosion for
   different surface areas such as the northern and southern hemisphere.
   Our annulus measurement for the total water production for Feb. 28 at
   2.21AU from the Sun is 2.5 x 10(26) molecules/s while for April 27 at
   1.76 AU it is 4.65 x 10(26). We find that about 83\% of the H2O resides
   in the illuminated portion of our annulus and about 17\% on the night
   side. We also make an attempt to obtain the fraction of the H2O
   production coming from the highly active neck of the comet versus the
   rest of the illuminated surface from the pole-on view of Feb. 28 and
   estimate that about 60\% of the H2O derives from the neck area. A rough
   estimate of the water surface evaporation rate of the illuminated
   nucleus for April 27 yields about 5 x 10(19) molecules/s/m(2).
   Spatial radial profiles of H2O on April 27 on the illuminated side of
   the comet, extending from 1.78 to 6.47 km from the nucleus center, show
   that water follows model predictions quite well, with the gas
   accelerating as it expands into the coma. Our dayside radial profile
   allows us to make an empirical determination of the expansion velocity
   of water. On the night side the spatial profile of water follows 1/rho.
   The CO2 profiles do not exhibit any acceleration into the coma but are
   closely matched by a 1/rho profile. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{With the overall objective of minimizing cost, this research
   experimentally investigates the effects of variations in the mix
   constituents of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) on its short term
   compressive and tensile behavior. The experimental variables are four
   different quantities of silica fume, three different quantities of
   silica powder, three different cement types (White Cement Type I,
   Portland Type V, GGBS/Portland Type I blend) and three different fiber
   volume contents (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 \%) of straight, smooth, high
   strength steel fibers. Such low fiber volume fractions have been rarely
   investigated in the past and are selected in this work to broaden the
   knowledge base and promote lower material cost. Experimental results
   showed minor differences in mechanical behavior due to variations in the
   quantity of silica fume. Silica powder changes led to little difference
   in material behavior, suggesting that silica powder can be removed due
   to its high cost. UHPCs containing White Type I cement exhibited the
   best performance in almost all aspects of behavior including load
   carrying capacity, energy absorption capacity and multiple cracking
   behaviors, but carried the highest cost. Specimens containing the
   GGBS/Portland I binder showed lower performance, but at decreased cost.
   UHPC specimens containing 0.5 \% fibers exhibited some strain hardening
   behavior, which became more pronounced as the fiber volume fraction
   increased. The results suggest that fiber volume contents of 1.0 or 1.5
   \% could significantly reduce the chance for crack localization under
   dead load or working conditions, respectively, in structural
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{At conceptual design stage, beam element is extensively used to create
   the frame structure of automobile body, which can not only archive the
   accurate stiffness but also reduce much computational cost. However, the
   stress definition of beam element is very complex so that the stress
   sensitivity and optimization are difficult to analytically derive and
   numerically program. This paper presents an solution to this problem and
   an application in the lightweight optimization design of automobile
   frame. Firstly, maximal Von Mises stress of rectangular tube is
   calculated by using the superposition of stress, which is together
   induced by the axial force, bending moments, torsional moment and shear
   force. Secondly, the sensitivity of Von Mises Stress with respect to
   size design variables: breadth, height and thickness are derived,
   respectively. Thirdly, an optimal criterion is constructed by Lagrangian
   multiplier method to solve the frame optimization with stress
   constraints. Lastly, numerical example of car frame proves that the
   proposed method can guarantee the stress of each beam element almost
   fully reaches at the yielding stress.}},

Abstract = {{The use of LiCoPO4 as a Li-ion cathode material can enable high energy 5
   V batteries. However, LiCoPO4 shows limited cycle life and much less
   than theoretical energy density. In order to address these shortcomings,
   Fe, Cr and Si substituted-LiCoPO4 (Cr,Si-LiCo(0.9)FemPO(4)) was
   investigated as an improved LiCoPO4 based cathode material. Fe
   substitution greatly improves the cycle life and increases the energy
   density. Cr substitution further increases the energy density, cycle
   life and rate capability. Si substitution reduces the reactivity of the
   cathode with electrolyte thereby increasing cycle life. In combination,
   the substituents lead to a LiCoPO4 based cathode material with no
   capacity fade over 250 cycles in Li/Cr,Si-LiCo0,9Fe0.1PO4 half cells, a
   discharge capacity of 140 mAh g(-1), at C/3 at an average discharge
   voltage of 4.78 V giving an energy density of 670 Wh per kg of cathode.
   In graphite/Cr,Si-LiCo0.9Fe0.1PO4 full Li-ion cells, the cathode

Abstract = {{Non-aqueous redox flow batteries (NAqRFBs) have recently received
   considerable attention as promising high energy density, low cost
   grid-level energy storage technologies. Despite these attractive
   features, NAqRFBs are still at an early stage of development and
   innovative design techniques are necessary to improve performance and
   decrease costs. In this work, we investigate multi-electron transfer,
   common ion exchange NAqRFBs. Common ion systems decrease the supporting
   electrolyte requirement, which subsequently improves active material
   solubility and decreases electrolyte cost. Voltammetric and electrolytic
   techniques are used to study the electrochemical performance and
   chemical compatibility of model redox active materials, iron (II)
   tris(2,2'-bipyridine) tetrafluoroborate (Fe(bpy)(3)(BF4)(2)) and
   ferrocenylmethyl dimethyl ethyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate
   (Fc1N112-BF4). These results help disentangle complex cycling behavior
   observed in flow cell experiments. Further, a simple techno-economic
   model demonstrates the cost benefits of employing common ion exchange
   NAqRFBs, afforded by decreasing the salt and solvent contributions to
   total chemical cost. This study highlights two new concepts, common ion
   exchange and multi-electron transfer, for NAqRFBs through a
   demonstration flow cell employing model active species. In addition, the
   compatibility analysis developed for asymmetric chemistries can apply to
   other promising species, including organics, metal coordination
   complexes (MCCs) and mixed MCC/organic systems, enabling the design of
   low cost NAqRFBs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of propagating Bessel beams is typically limited to
   optical frequencies with bulky experimental setups. Recent works have
   demonstrated Bessel-beam generation at microwave and millimeter-wave
   frequencies utilizing low-profile, planar, leaky-wave antennas. These
   studies have assumed a single leaky mode in the antenna. In this work,
   the rigorous analysis of a planar Bessel-beam launcher supporting
   multiple modes is presented. By employing the mode-matching technique, a
   complete electromagnetic solution of the structure, its supported modes,
   and radiated fields is obtained. Additionally, a coupled system of two
   planar Bessel launchers is analyzed, and it is shown that the system can
   both transmit and receive Bessel beams. The energy-transfer
   characteristics of the coupled system are analyzed and discussed. An
   analysis of the coupled system's even and odd modes of operation show
   that efficient power transfer is possible, and that an odd mode is
   preferred since it yields higher field confinement and power-transfer
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The elasto-optic tensor elements p(12) and p(44) of glasses in the

   measured using Brillouin spectroscopy. Densities, refractive indices,

   the elasto-optic tensor elements based on a bond-polarizability
   approach, which was validated using first-principles calculations and
   then used to explain the compositional trends observed in the
   elasto-optic tensor elements. It was found that the shear elasto-optic
   element p(44) could be explained in terms of the average bond
   polarizability anisotropy, while the dilation response p(11) + 2p(12)
   involved also the bulk cell polarizability response to volume changes.}},

Abstract = {{Ethanol remains the most important alternative fuel for the
   transportation sector. This work presents new experimental data on
   ethanol ignition, including stable species measurements, obtained with
   the University of Michigan rapid compression facility. Ignition delay
   times were determined from pressure histories of ignition experiments
   with stoichiometric ethanol air-mixtures at pressures of,similar to 3-10
   atm. Temperatures (880-1150 K) were controlled by varying buffer gas
   composition (Ar, N-2, CO2). High-speed imaging was used to record
   chemiluminescence during the experiments, which showed homogeneous
   ignition events. The results for ignition delay time agreed well with
   trends on the basis of previous experimental measurements. Speciation
   experiments were performed using fast gas sampling and gas
   chromatography to identify and quantify ethanol and 11 stable
   intermediate species formed during the ignition delay period.
   Simulations were carried out using a chemical kinetic mechanism
   available in the literature, and the agreement with the experimental
   results for ignition delay time and the intermediate species measured
   was excellent for the majority of the conditions studied. From the
   simulation results, ethanol + HO2, was identified as an important
   reaction at the experimental conditions for both the ignition delay time
   and intermediate species measurements. Further studies to improve the
   accuracy of the rate coefficient for ethanol + HO2 would improve the
   predictive understanding of intermediate and low-temperature ethanol
   combustion.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) derived tissues often remain
   developmentally immature in vitro, and become more adult-like in their
   structure, cellular diversity and function following transplantation
   into immunocompromised mice. Previously we have demonstrated that
   hPSC-derived human lung organoids (HLOs) resembled human fetal lung
   tissue in vitro (Dye et al., 2015). Here we show that HLOs required a
   bioartificial microporous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffold
   niche for successful engraftment, long-term survival, and maturation of
   lung epithelium in vivo. Analysis of scaffold-grown transplanted tissue
   showed airway-like tissue with enhanced epithelial structure and
   organization compared to HLOs grown in vitro. By further comparing in
   vitro and in vivo grown HLOs with fetal and adult human lung tissue, we
   found that in vivo transplanted HLOs had improved cellular
   differentiation of secretory lineages that is reflective of differences
   between fetal and adult tissue, resulting in airway-like structures that
   were remarkably similar to the native adult human lung.}},

Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been shown to influence the global
   carbon sink by increasing the fraction of diffuse light, which increases
   photosynthesis over a greater fraction of the vegetated canopy. Between
   1995 and 2013, U.S. SO2 emissions declined by over 70\%, coinciding with
   observed AOD reductions of 3.0 +/- 0.6\% yr(-1) over the eastern U.S. In
   the Community Earth System Model (CESM), these trends cause diffuse
   light to decrease regionally by almost 0.6\% yr(-1), leading to declines
   in gross primary production (GPP) of 0.07\% yr(-1). Integrated over the
   analysis period and domain, this represents 0.5 Pg C of omitted GPP. A
   separate upscaling calculation that used published relationships between
   GPP and diffuse light agreed with the CESM model results within 20\%.
   The agreement between simulated and data-constrained upscaling results
   strongly suggests that anthropogenic sulfate trends have a small impact
   on carbon uptake in temperate forests due to scattered light.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical methods developed over the past two decades enable preparation
   of colloidal nanocrystals with uniform size and shape. These Brownian
   objects readily order into superlattices. Recently, the range of
   accessible inorganic cores and tunable surface chemistries dramatically
   increased, expanding the set of nanocrystal arrangements experimentally
   attainable. In this review, we discuss efforts to create next-generation
   materials via bottom-up organization of nanocrystals with preprogrammed
   functionality and self-assembly instructions. This process is often
   driven by both interparticle interactions and the influence of the
   assembly environment. The introduction provides the reader with a
   practical overview of nanocrystal synthesis, self-assembly, and
   superlattice characterization. We then summarize the theory of
   nanocrystal interactions and examine fundamental principles governing
   nanocrystal self-assembly from hard and soft particle perspectives
   borrowed from the comparatively established fields of micrometer
   colloids and block copolymer assembly. We outline the extensive catalog
   of superlattices prepared to date using hydrocarbon-capped nanocrystals
   with spherical, polyhedral, rod, plate, and branched inorganic core
   shapes, as well as those obtained by mixing combinations thereof. We
   also provide an overview of structural defects in nanocrystal
   superlattices. We then explore the unique possibilities offered by
   leveraging nontraditional surface chemistries and assembly environments
   to control superlattice structure and produce nonbulk assemblies. We end
   with a discussion of the unique optical, magnetic, electronic, and
   catalytic properties of ordered nanocrystal superlattices, and the
   coming advances required to make use of this new class of solids.}},

Abstract = {{Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes models represent the workhorse for
   studying turbulent flows in academia and in industry. Such single-point
   turbulence models have limitations in accounting for the influence of
   the nonlocal physics and flow history on turbulence evolution. In this
   context, we investigate the sensitivity inherent in such single-point
   models due to their characterization of the internal structure of
   homogeneous turbulent flows solely by the means of the Reynolds
   stresses. For a wide variety of mean flows under diverse conditions, we
   study the prediction intervals engendered due to this coarse-grained
   description. The nature of this variability and its dependence on
   parameters such as the mean flow topology, the initial Reynolds stress
   tensor, and the relative influence of linear contra nonlinear physics is
   identified, analyzed, and explicated.}},

Title = {{Atomically engineered ferroic layers yield a room - temperature
   magnetoelectric multiferroic}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},

Abstract = {{Materials that exhibit simultaneous order in their electric and magnetic
   ground states hold promise for use in next-generation memory devices in
   which electric fields control magnetism(1,2). Such materials are
   exceedingly rare, however, owing to competing requirements for
   displacive ferroelectricity and magnetism(3). Despite the recent
   identification of several new multiferroic materials and magnetoelectric
   coupling mechanisms(4-15), known single-phase multiferroics remain
   limited by antiferromagnetic or weak ferromagnetic alignments, by a lack
   of coupling between the order parameters, or by having properties that
   emerge only well below room temperature, precluding device
   applications(2). Here we present a methodology for constructing
   single-phase multiferroic materials in which ferroelectricity and strong
   magnetic ordering are coupled near room temperature. Starting with
   hexagonal LuFeO3-the geometric ferroelectric with the greatest known
   planar rumpling(16)-we introduce individual monolayers of FeO during
   growth to construct formula-unit-thick syntactic layers of ferrimagnetic
   LuFe2O4 (refs 17, 18) within the LuFeO3 matrix, that is,
   (LuFeO3)(m)/(LuFe2O4)(1) superlattices. The severe rumpling imposed by
   the neighbouring LuFeO3 drives the ferrimagnetic LuFe2O4 into a
   simultaneously ferroelectric state, while also reducing the LuFe2O4 spin
   frustration. This increases the magnetic transition temperature
   substantially-from 240 kelvin for LuFe2O4 (ref. 18) to 281 kelvin for
   (LuFeO3)(9)/(LuFe2O4)(1). Moreover, the ferroelectric order couples to
   the ferrimagnetism, enabling direct electric-field control of magnetism
   at 200 kelvin. Our results demonstrate a design methodology for creating
   higher-temperature magnetoelectric multiferroics by exploiting a
   combination of geometric frustration, lattice distortions and epitaxial
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemical' characteristics of several Keggin-type
   polyxometalates (POMs) in acetonitrile were investigated by cyclic
   voltammetry. The effects of three types of substitutions (countercation,
   heteroatom, and framework metal element) were investigated. The spectra
   for group IA or IIA POM salts showed three redox couples, with only
   slightly different peak positions (+/- 0.1 V). Lithium salts were
   selected for exploration of other TOM compositions in order to prevent
   H-2 evolution in electrocheihical experiments. CV spectra of
   heteroatom-exchanged POMs showed that the overall charge on the POM
   affects reduction potentials. Substitution of the framework metal atoms
   (Mo, W, and V) had the greatest effect On reduction potentials. The
   results of this study demonstrate that reduction potentials in water may
   provide a useful guide to relative reduction potentials for POMs

Abstract = {{The stimuli-responsive nature of molecular gels makes them appealing
   platforms, for sensing. The biggest challenge is identifying an
   appropriate: gelator for each specific chemical or biological target.
   Due to the similarities between crystallization and gel formation, we
   hypothesized that the tools Used to predict crystal morphologies could
   be useful for identifying gelators. Herein, we demonstrate that new
   gelators can be discovered by focusing on scaffolds with predicted high
   aspect ratio crystals. Using this morphology prediction method, we
   identified two promising molecular scaffolds containing lead atoms.
   Because solvent is largely ignored in morphology prediction but can play
   a major role in gelation, each scaffold needed to be structurally
   modified before six new Pb-containing gelators were discovered. One of
   these new gelators was,developed into a robust sensor capable of
   detecting lead at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency limit foR
   paint (5000 ppm).}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{We study the temperature-dependent electrical and optical properties of
   hybrid charge transfer excitons (HCTEs) at a
   ZnO/4,4'-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1'-biphenyl (CBP) organic/inorganic
   semiconductor heterojunction (OI-HJ). The electroluminescence spectrum
   of the HCTE formed by recombination of injected charge undergoes a
   hypsochromic shift from 1.65 +/- 0.01 eV to 2.05 +/- 0.01 eV with
   decreasing temperature from T = 300K to 30 K at a current density of J =
   100 mA cm(-2), and with increasing voltage from V = 1.5V to 4.5 V. We
   observe an external quantum efficiency of 6.0 +/- 0.2\% at a wavelength
   of 332 nm for excitons generated in CBP, indicating exciton to charge
   conversion via HCTEs. However, no HCTE photoluminescence is observed at
   temperatures as low as T = 25 K. A quantum mechanical model based on the
   coexistence of both free and trapped singlet HCTE states at the OI-HJ
   describes these observations. The free HCTE consists of a hole in CPB
   Coulombically bound with an energy of 9 meV to a delocalized electron in
   ZnO, and it is the precursor to photocurrent generation via CBP Frenkel
   excitons. The observed electroluminescence is due to electron injection
   into localized defect states at the ZnO surface that are bound to holes
   in CBP forming a trapped HCTE with binding energies of 60-430 meV and
   oscillator strength that is four orders of magnitude higher compared to
   the free HCTE.}},

Abstract = {{An unprecedented mode of reactivity of Zn4O-based metal-organic
   frameworks (MOFs) offers a straightforward and powerful approach to
   polymer-hybridized porous solids. The concept is illustrated with the
   production of MOF-5-polystyrene wherein polystyrene is grafted and
   uniformly distributed throughout MOF-5 crystals after heating in pure
   styrene for 4-24 h. The surface area and polystyrene content of the
   material can be fine-tuned by controlling the duration of heating
   styrene in the presence of MOF-5. Polystyrene grafting significantly
   alters the physical and chemical properties of pristine MOF-5, which is
   evident from the unique guest adsorption properties (solvatochromic dye
   uptake and improved CO2 capacity) as well as the dramatically improved
   hydrolytic stability of composite. Based on the fact that MOF-5 is the
   best studied member of the structure class, and has been produced at
   scale by industry, these findings can be directly leveraged for a range
   of current applications.}},

   This article summarises predictive horticultural models in the

   explanatory models. It encourages the use of statistical learning and
   nonlinear methods for future predictive models. Then it demonstrates how
   predictive models can be constructed using data for Royal Gala apples
   from orchards within New Zealand. For the eight years of data available
   the model has been shown to have a mean predictive error of 6.7\%. The
   best model was an ensemble of a linear model (GLM), a Bayesian additive
   regression tree (BART), and a boosted classification and regression tree
   (boosted CART). Statistical learning techniques present substantial

Abstract = {{We demonstrate through Brownian dynamics simulations a phase transition
   in plastic crystalline assemblies of Janus spheres through controlled
   pressure anisotropy. When the pressure in plane with hexagonally ordered
   layers is increased relative to that normal to the layers, a rapid
   first-order rotator-to-lamellar transition of Janus sphere orientation
   occurs at constant temperature. We show that the underlying mechanism
   closely follows the Maier-Saupe theory, originally developed for
   isotropic-to-nematic transition in positionally disordered materials but
   here applied to positionally ordered ones. Since the transition involves
   almost no translational diffusion or volume change, and occurs rapidly
   by particle rotation, the results should help guide the design of
   rapidly switchable colloidal crystals.}},

Abstract = {{The onset of distant organ metastasis from primary breast cancer marks
   the transition to a stage IV diagnosis. Standard imaging modalities
   often detect distant metastasis when the burden of disease is high,
   underscoring the need for improved methods of detection to allow for
   interventions that would impede disease progression. Here, microporous
   poly(e-caprolactone) scaffolds were developed that capture early
   metastatic cells and thus serve as a sentinel for early detection. These
   scaffolds were used to characterize the dynamic immune response to the
   implant spanning the acute and chronic foreign body response. The immune
   cell composition had stabilized at the scaffold after approximately 1
   month and changed dramatically within days to weeks after tumor
   inoculation, with CD11b(+)Gr1(hi)Ly6C(-) cells having the greatest
   increase in abundance. Implanted scaffolds recruited metastatic cancer
   cells that were inoculated into the mammary fat pad in vivo, which also
   significantly reduced tumor burden in the liver and brain. Additionally,
   cancer cells could be detected using a label-free imaging modality
   termed inverse spectroscopic optical coherence tomography, and we tested
   the hypothesis that subsequent removal of the primary tumor after early
   detection would enhance survival. Surgical removal of the primary tumor
   following cancer cell detection in the scaffold significantly improved
   disease-specific survival. The enhanced disease-specific survival was
   associated with a systemic reduction in the CD11b(+)Gr1(hi)Ly6C(-) cells
   as a consequence of the implant, which was further supported by Gr-1
   depletion studies. Implementation of the scaffold may provide diagnostic
   and therapeutic options for cancer patients in both the high-risk and
   adjuvant treatment settings. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{The reaction of methanimine (CH2NH) with the hydroperoxy (HO2) radical
   has been investigated by using a combination of ab initio and density
   functional theory (CCSD(T)/CBSB7//B3LYP+Dispersion/CBSB7) and master
   equation calculations based on transition state theory (TST).
   Variational TST was used to compute both canonical (CVTST) and
   microcanonical (mu VTST) rate constants for barrierless reactions. The
   title reaction starts with the reversible formation of a cyclic
   prereactive complex (PRC) that is bound by similar to 11 kcal/mol and
   contains hydrogen bonds to both nitrogen and oxygen. The reaction path
   for the entrance channel was investigated by a series of constrained
   optimizations, which showed that the reaction is barrierless (i.e., no
   intrinsic energy barrier along the path). However, the variations in the
   potential energy, vibrational frequencies, and rotational constants
   reveal that the two hydrogen bonds are formed sequentially, producing
   two reaction flux bottlenecks (i.e., two transition states) along the
   reaction path, which were modeled using W. H. Miller's unified TST
   approach. The rate constant computed for the formation of the PRC is
   pressure dependent and increases at lower temperatures. Under
   atmospheric conditions, the PRC dissociates rapidly and its lifetime is
   too short for it to undergo significant bimolecular reaction with other
   species. A small fraction isomerizes via a cyclic transition state and
   subsequent reactions lead to products normally expected from hydrogen
   abstraction reactions. The kinetics of the HO2 + CH2NH reaction system
   differs substantially from the analogous isoelectronic reaction systems
   involving C2H4 and CH2O, which have been the subjects of previous
   experimental and theoretical studies.}},

Title = {{An automated rat single pellet reaching system with high-speed video
   capture}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{271}},
Pages = {{119-127}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Single pellet reaching is an established task for studying
   fine motor control in which rats reach for, grasp, and eat food pellets
   in a stereotyped sequence. Most incarnations of this task require
   constant attention, limiting the number of animals that can be tested
   and the number of trials per session. Automated versions allow more
   interventions in more animals, but must be robust and reproducible.
   New method: Our system automatically delivers single reward pellets for
   rats to grasp with their forepaw. Reaches are detected using real-time
   computer vision, which triggers video acquisition from multiple angles
   using mirrors. This allows us to record high-speed (>300 frames per
   second) video, and trigger interventions (e.g., optogenetics) with high
   temporal precision. Individual video frames are triggered by digital
   pulses that can be synchronized with behavior, experimental
   interventions, or recording devices (e.g., electrophysiology). The
   system is housed within a soundproof chamber with integrated lighting
   and ventilation, allowing multiple skilled reaching systems in one room.
   Results: We show that rats acquire the automated task similarly to
   manual versions, that the task is robust, and can be synchronized with
   optogenetic interventions.
   Comparison with existing methods: Existing skilled reaching protocols
   require high levels of investigator involvement, or, if ad libitum, do
   not allow for integration of high-speed, synchronized data collection.
   Conclusion: This task will facilitate the study of motor learning and
   control by efficiently recording large numbers of skilled movements. It
   can be adapted for use with modern neurophysiology, which demands high
   temporal precision. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Saturn's moon Enceladus offers a unique opportunity in the search for
   life and habitable environments beyond Earth, a key theme of the
   National Research Council's 2013-2022 Decadal Survey. A plume of water
   vapor and ice spews from Enceladus's south polar region. Cassini data
   suggest that this plume, sourced by a liquid reservoir beneath the
   moon's icy crust, contain organics, salts, and water rock interaction
   derivatives. Thus, the ingredients for life as we know it liquid water,
   chemistry, and energy sources are available in Enceladus's subsurface
   ocean. We have only to sample the plumes to investigate this hidden
   ocean environment. We present a New Frontiers class, solar -powered
   Enceladus orbiter that would take advantage of this opportunity, Testing
   the Habitability of Enceladus's Ocean (THEO). Developed by the 2015 Jet
   Propulsion Laboratory Planetary Science Summer School student
   participants under the guidance of TeamX, this mission concept includes
   remote sensing and in situ analyses with a mass spectrometer, a sub -mm
   radiometer spectrome ter, a camera, and two magnetometers. These
   instruments were selected to address four key questions for ascertaining
   the habitability of Enceladus's ocean within the context of the moon's
   geological activity: (1) how are the plumes and ocean connected? (2) are
   the abiotic conditions of the ocean suitable for habitability? (3) how
   stable is the ocean environment? (4) is there evidence of biological
   processes? By taking advantage of the opportunity Enceladus's plumes
   offer, THEO represents a viable, solar -powered option for exploring a
   potentially habitable ocean world of the outer solar system. (C) 2016

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have become increasingly popular due to
   their high fuel economy performance. HEVs typically fall into three
   categories according to their powertrain configuration, namely serial,
   parallel, and power-split hybrid. All these configurations use small
   internal combustion engines (ICEs), which can suffer from high torque
   fluctuations detrimental for noise, vibration and harshness performance.
   This paper introduces a novel architecture of hybrid electric powertrain
   systems (patent pending) which suppresses torque fluctuations and
   carries out the functionality of hybrid driving. This new hybrid
   architecture conceptually lies between a serial and a power-split. The
   new system uses an ICE and two electric machines, including one with a
   rotating stator, and has the functionalities of existing hybrid
   powertrains, including transmission, boost, regenerative braking. The
   paper presents a model for this new powertrain, and a unique controller
   implemented in MATLAB Simulinlc. A specially designed ruled-based
   multi-state controller is included in the model to achieve control and
   enhance fuel economy. Results of drive cycle simulations show the
   systems performance including torque fluctuation suppression and great
   fuel economy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) currently sold are power-split HEVs
   that use single, double or occasionally even multiple planetary gear
   (PG) sets to connect their powertrain elements. Adding PG sets can
   provide more design flexibility; however, it also increases system
   complexity and cost. This paper presents a comparative study of hybrid
   powertrains with different numbers of PG sets, which we term
   configurations. The analysis of different configuration types is
   investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the qualitative
   analysis, the performances of operating modes for different
   configurations are compared, in terms of mode number, normalized
   efficiency, and maximum output torque. The quantitative approach
   compares the designs of different configurations; the fuel economy and
   acceleration performance of all superior designs are evaluated to make
   the comparison iconic. The results show that triple-PG hybrids do not
   have significant fuel economy improvement compared with double-PG
   hybrids, but they achieve a dramatic improvement in acceleration
   performance; this can be beneficial for sport utility vehicles (SUVs),
   light trucks, and buses. For cost consideration, it is suggested that
   passenger cars adopt double-PG hybrid powertrains. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Characterization and modeling of the thermal mechanics of lithium-ion
   battery cells}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {{633-646}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The thermal mechanics of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is explored with
   a focus on thermal swelling. Experiments show for the first time that
   the swelling shape of prismatic battery cells due to temperature
   variations is significantly different from that due to Li-ion
   intercalation in unconstrained conditions. In contrast to uniform and
   orthotropic Li-ion intercalation swelling in a direction perpendicular
   to electrodes, the nonuniform temperature distribution in the jellyroll
   and the gaps/voids between electrodes result in distinguishable
   different swelling shapes. A unique coupled thermal-structural analysis
   with a simple, but efficient 3-D finite numerical model is proposed to
   investigate the impact of temperature variations on the thermal
   behaviors of battery cells. Anisotropic heat conduction and temperature
   dependency of the coefficient of thermal expansion are taken into
   account and found to have an impact on temperature distribution and
   thermal expansion. Experimental validation of the proposed model clearly
   demonstrates that the coupled thermal-structural analysis with the
   proposed model can predict accurately the thermal swelling at
   unconstrained conditions. The solution at pack (constrained) conditions
   shows that the nonuniform temperature distribution of the jellyroll
   still plays a critical role for the thermal swelling shape, although the
   gaps/voids do not occur because of the constraints from spacers in the
   pack, suggesting that the estimation of core temperature is important.
   Such an accurate model, able to estimate cell thermal behavior, is
   beneficial to the design of Li-ion batteries, development of stress or
   strain sensors, optimum sensor placement, and thermal management of not
   only single battery cells but also battery packs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A novel phenomenological multi-physics model of Lithium-ion battery
   cells is developed for control and state estimation purposes. The model
   can capture electrical, thermal, and mechanical behaviors of battery
   cells under constrained conditions, e.g., battery pack conditions.
   Specifically, the proposed model predicts the core and surface
   temperatures and reaction force induced from the volume change of
   battery cells because of electrochemically- and thermally-induced
   swelling. Moreover, the model incorporates the influences of changes in
   preload and ambient temperature on the force considering severe
   environmental conditions electrified vehicles face. Intensive
   experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed multi-physics
   model accurately predicts the surface temperature and reaction force for
   a wide operational range of preload and ambient temperature. This high
   fidelity model can be useful for more accurate and robust state of
   charge estimation considering the complex dynamic behaviors of the
   battery cell. Furthermore, the inherent simplicity of the mechanical
   measurements offers distinct advantages to improve the existing power
   and thermal management strategies for battery management. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Mechanical behaviors of chopped, natural fiber composites with and

   using finite element analysis (FEA), with references to previously

   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of fracture surfaces from test
   specimens are analyzed, and correlations between numerically predicted
   behaviors and fracture paths, and fracture surface images are discussed.
   The FEA results reflect experimental trends well including the effects
   of fibers and the presence of voids. These have also been found to
   induce specific regions of stress concentration. Inspection of fracture
   surfaces reveals transition from ductile to brittle behavior at low
   strain rates, generally brittle failure modes, and little evidence of
   fibers stressed to their tensile limits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{429-436}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the susceptibility of cementitious materials to
   internal moisture condition by the autogenous deformation measurement in
   the 0.35 water-binder (wpb) ratio systems (paste, mortar and concrete).
   Autogenous shrinkage is obtained by separating the thermal effects from
   the measured total deformation using the maturity concept and the
   coefficient of thermal deformation (CTD). Three factors affecting the
   autogenous shrinkage are presented, that is the aggregate content, the
   partial replacement of portland cement with slag cement and of normal
   weight fine aggregate with lightweight aggregate (LWA). Autogenous
   shrinkage is clearly reduced by an increasing aggregate content and this
   effect is predicted by an improved Pickett's model using a
   time-dependent aggregate restraining factor. A binary cementitious
   system of portland cement and slag cement increases the autogenous
   shrinkage in the long term. Contribution of slag cement can be
   characterized by the difference in autogenous shrinkage between the
   binary system and the control system scaled down by the replacement
   ratio. The negative effect of slag cement can be neutralized by the
   incorporation of LWA as a partial sand replacement. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{321}},
Pages = {{947-964}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we perform a Fourier stability analysis of MC-CMFD, a
   hybrid Monte Carlo k-eigenvalue method that utilizes coarse mesh finite
   difference (CMFD) feedback. The MC-CMFD method is nonlinear and contains
   random statistical errors; both of these features are inconsistent with
   the direct application of a Fourier stability analysis. To accomplish
   this analysis, we first formulate a non-random iteration method that
   approximates MC-CMFD, by assuming an infinite number of Monte Carlo
   particles per cycle. Then we (i) linearize this method, and (ii)
   Fourier-analyze the linearized method to theoretically predict its
   convergence properties. Finally, we demonstrate by direct numerical
   simulations that the Fourier analysis of the linearized non-random
   method accurately predicts the stability and fission source convergence
   rate (during the inactive cycles) of the original nonlinear MC-CMFD
   method. We do this by comparing the predictions of the Fourier analysis
   to simulations that utilize (i) a high-fidelity SN-CMFD code (which has
   no random statistical errors), and (ii) a MC-CMFD code (which has random
   statistical errors). The Fourier analysis and our two test codes confirm
   that the MC-CMFD method is stable if the optical thickness of the coarse
   grid (in the low-order CMFD calculation) is sufficiently small. However,
   the spectral radius increases monotonically with the coarse grid size,
   and if the latter exceeds a critical value, the MC-CMFD method becomes
   unstable. We discuss some implications of our results for practical
   MC-CMFD simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{481-496}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{CFD simulations of reacting fuel sprays were conducted to identify
   temperature-dependent physical properties of the liquid fuel that should
   be emulated by diesel and jet fuel surrogates during compression ignited
   combustion. Using a validated CFD model for an n-dodecane spray under
   diesel-relevant conditions, six physical properties of the liquid phase
   fuel (density, vapor pressure, viscosity, surface tension, heat of
   vaporization, and specific heat capacity) were perturbed covering the
   minimum and maximum property range of hydrocarbons widely used in recent
   diesel and jet fuel surrogates. Liquid fuel density, viscosity, vapor
   pressure, and specific heat had significant impact on liquid penetration
   length, causing a 4-16\% change from the baseline n-dodecane case. The
   changes resulted from the liquid fuel's influence on various physical
   phenomena, including droplet breakup, air entrainment and evaporation.
   For ignition delay, specific heat and density effects were most
   significant, with up to 10\% changes from the baseline case. Specific
   heat perturbations affected the thermal energy necessary for fuel
   vaporization, hence local temperature development and mixture
   reactivity. Liquid density influenced the velocity of the fuel injection
   event, which modified turbulent mixing rates, low temperature heat
   release characteristics and the transition to high temperature ignition.
   The results of this study indicate that liquid density, specific heat,
   viscosity, and vapor pressure should be considered for surrogate
   development to properly capture the liquid penetration and ignition
   delay characteristics of the target fuel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All
