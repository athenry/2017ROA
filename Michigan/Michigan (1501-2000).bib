Abstract = {{We present a volumetric monitoring method to observe the morphological
   changes of aqueous two phase system (ATPS) droplets in a microfluidic
   system. Our method is based on time-lapse optical coherence tomography
   (OCT) which allows the study of the dynamics of ATPS droplets while
   visualizing their 3D structures and providing quantitative information
   on the droplets. In this study, we monitored the process of rehydration
   and deformation of an ATPS droplet in a microfluidic system and
   quantified the changes of its volume and velocity under both static and
   dynamic fluid conditions. Our results indicate that time-lapse OCT is a
   very promising tool to evaluate the unprecedented features of
   droplet-based microfluidics.}},

   possible ``which set in C2 is the most difficult to connect up?{''} This
   is an example of a max-min problem: find the set A E S2 such that the
   value of some minimization (covering) problem is as large as possible.
   In this article, we show that for certain covering problems that admit
   good deterministic online algorithms, we can give good algorithms for
   max-min optimization when the set system C2 is given by a p-system or
   knapsack constraints or both. This result is similar to results for
   constrained maximization of submodular functions. Although many natural
   covering problems are not even approximately submodular, we show that
   one can use properties of the online algorithm as a surrogate{''}for
   submodularity.
   Moreover, we give stronger connections between max-min optimization and
   two-stage robust optimization, and hence give improved algorithms for
   robust versions of various covering problems, for cases where the
   uncertainty sets are given by p-systems and knapsack constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral nanostructures from metals and semiconductors attract wide
   interest as components for polarization-enabled optoelectronic devices.
   Similarly to other fields of nanotechnology, graphene-based materials
   can greatly enrich physical and chemical phenomena associated with
   optical and electronic properties of chiral nanostructures and
   facilitate their applications in biology as well as other areas. Here,
   we report that covalent attachment of L/D-cysteine moieties to the edges
   of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) leads to their helical buckling due to
   chiral interactions at the ``crowded{''} edges. Circular dichroism (CD)
   spectra of the GQDs revealed bands at ca. 210-220 and 250-265 nm that
   changed their signs for different chirality of the cysteine edge
   ligands. The high-energy chiroptical peaks at 210-220 nm correspond to
   the hybridized molecular orbitals involving the chiral center of amino
   acids and atoms of graphene edges. Diverse experimental and modeling
   data, including density functional theory calculations of CD spectra
   with probabilistic distribution of GQD isomers, indicate that the band
   at 250-265 nm originates from the three-dimensional twisting of the
   graphene sheet and can be attributed to the chiral excitonic
   transitions. The positive and negative low-energy CD bands correspond to
   the left and right helicity of GQDs, respectively. Exposure of liver
   HepG2 cells to L/D-GQDs reveals their general biocompatibility and a
   noticeable difference in the toxicity of the stereoisomers. Molecular
   dynamics simulations demonstrated that D-GQDs have a stronger tendency
   to accumulate within the cellular membrane than L-GQDs. Emergence of
   nanoscale chirality in GQDs decorated with biomolecules is expected to
   be a general stereochemical phenomenon for flexible sheets of
   nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the effect of piezoelectric material on the flutter
   speed, vibration mode and frequency, and energy harvesting power and
   efficiency of a flexible flag in various fluids. We develop a fully
   coupled fluid-solid-electric model by combining the inviscid vortex
   sheet model with a linear electro-mechanical coupling model. A
   resistance only circuit and a resonant resistance-inductance (RL)
   circuit are considered. For a purely resistive circuit, an increased
   electro-mechanical coupling factor results in an increased flutter
   speed, vibration frequency, averaged electric power, and efficiency. A
   consistent optimal resistance is found that maximizes the flutter speed
   and the energy harvesting power. For a resonant RL circuit, by tuning
   the inductance to match the circuit frequency to the flag's vibration
   frequency, the flutter speed can be greatly decreased, and a larger
   averaged power and efficiency are obtained. We also consider a model
   scale setup with several commonly used commercial materials for
   operating in air and water. Typical ranges of dimensionless parameters
   are obtained for four types of material that span a wide range of solid
   density and rigidity values. We find that the resistance only circuit is
   more effective when the flag is placed in a lighter fluid (e.g., air),
   while the RL circuit is able to reduce the flutter speed when the flag
   is placed in a heavier fluid (e.g., water). (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Battery electric buses can reduce energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions in China's transportation system. On-road testing is necessary
   to evaluate these benefits compared to their diesel counterparts through
   life-cycle assessment for both the upstream fuel production and
   operation stages. Three electric buses from China are operated and
   charged in Macao under different air-conditioning, load, and speed
   settings. In the minimum load scenario, the two 12-m buses achieve
   138-175 kWh/100 km, and the 8-m bus achieves 79 kWh/100 km (system
   charging loss included). When air-conditioning and load are at their
   maximum values, the energy consumption increases by 21-27\%; however,
   air-conditioning usage exerts a greater impact than passenger load. The
   diesel bus on-road performance increases more significantly than the
   electric bus performance under low speeds, higher load, and
   air-conditioning use, while the electric bus energy and CO2 emission
   benefits increase. Across a wide range of conditions, the electric bus
   reduces petroleum use by 85-87\% compared to a diesel bus and achieves a
   32-46\% reduction in fossil fuel use and 19-35\% in CO2 emissions from a
   life-cycle perspective. A cleaner power grid and an increase in system
   charging efficiency (if better than 60 84\%) would enhance the future
   benefits of electric buses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a distributed multiuser system where individual entities
   possess observations or perceptions of one another, while the truth is
   only known to themselves and they might have an interest in withholding
   or distorting the truth. We ask the question whether it is possible for
   the system as a whole to arrive at the correct perceptions or assessment
   of all users, referred to as their reputation, by encouraging or
   incentivizing the users to participate in a collective effort without
   violating private information and self-interest. In this paper, we
   investigate this problem using a mechanism design theoretic approach. We
   introduce a number of utility models representing users' strategic
   behavior, each consisting of one or both of a truth element and an image
   element, reflecting the user's desire to obtain an accurate view of
   others and an inflated image of itself. For each model, we either design
   a mechanism that achieves the optimal performance (solution to the
   corresponding centralized problem), or present individually rational
   suboptimal solutions. In the latter case, we demonstrate that even when
   the centralized solution is not achievable, by using a simple
   punish-reward mechanism, not only does a user have the incentive to
   participate and provide information, but also that this information can
   improve the system performance.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new method for the joint design of k-space trajectory and
   RF pulse in 3D small-tip tailored excitation. Designing time-varying RF
   and gradient waveforms for a desired 3D target excitation pattern in MRI
   poses a non-linear, non-convex, constrained optimization problem with
   relatively large problem size that is difficult to solve directly.
   Existing joint pulse design approaches are therefore typically
   restricted to predefined trajectory types such as EPI or
   stack-of-spirals that intrinsically satisfy the gradient maximum and
   slew rate constraints and reduce the problem size (dimensionality)
   dramatically, but lead to suboptimal excitation accuracy for a given
   pulse duration. Here we use a 2nd-order B-spline basis that can be
   fitted to an arbitrary k-space trajectory, and allows the gradient
   constraints to be implemented efficiently. We show that this allows the
   joint optimization problem to be solved with quite general k-space
   trajectories. Starting from an arbitrary initial trajectory, we first
   approximate the trajectory using B-spline basis, and then optimize the
   corresponding coefficients. We evaluate our method in simulation using
   four different k-space initializations: stack-of-spirals, SPINS,
   KT-points, and a new method based on KT-points. In all cases, our
   approach leads to substantial improvement in excitation accuracy for a
   given pulse duration. We also validated our method for inner-volume
   excitation using phantom experiments. The computation is fast enough for
   online applications.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, carrying control signals on passing data packets has emerged
   as a promising direction for efficient control information transmission.
   With control messages carried on data payload, the extra air time needed
   for control packets like RTS/CTS is eliminated and thus channel
   utilization is improved. However, carrying control signals on the data
   payload of a packet requires the data packet to have a sufficiently
   large SNR, otherwise both the data packet and the control messages are
   lost. In this paper, we propose Hitchhike, a technique that utilizes the
   preamble field to carry controlmessages. Hitchhike completely decouples
   the control messages from the payload and therefore the superposition of
   (multiple) control messages has little adverse effect on the operation
   of the payload decoding. We implement and evaluate Hitchhike in the
   USRP2 platform with five nodes. Evaluation results demonstrate the
   feasibility and effectiveness of Hitchhike. Compared with the
   state-of-the-art, e.g., side-channel in 802.15.4, Hitchhike improves the
   detection accuracy of control messages by 40\% and reduces the data loss
   caused by control messages by 15\%.}},

Abstract = {{Filtering algorithms are the workhorse of spacecraft attitude
   estimation, but recent research has shown that the use of batch
   estimation techniques can result in higher accuracy per unit of
   computational cost. This paper presents an approach for singularity-free
   batch estimation of attitude in continuous time using B-Spline curves on
   unit-length quaternions. It extends existing theory of unit-length
   quaternion B-splines to general Lie groups and arbitrary B-spline order.
   It is shown how to use these curves for continuous-time batch estimation
   using Gauss-Newton or Levenberg-Marquardt, including efficient curve
   initialization, a parameter update step that preserves the Lie group
   constraint within an unconstrained optimization framework, and the
   derivation of Jacobians of the B-spline's value and its time derivatives
   with respect to an update of its parameters. For unit-length quaternion
   splines, the equations for angular velocity and angular acceleration are
   derived. An implementation of this algorithm is evaluated on two
   problems: spacecraft attitude estimation using a three-axis
   magnetometer, a sun sensor, and 1) a three-axis gyroscope, and 2) a
   continuous-time vehicle dynamics model based on Euler's equation. Its
   performance is compared against a standard multiplicative extended
   Kalman filter and a recently published batch attitude estimation
   algorithm. The results show that B-splines have equal or superior
   performance over all test cases and provide two key tuning parameters,
   the number of knots and the spline order, that an engineer can use to
   trade off accuracy and computational efficiency when choosing a spline
   representation for a given estimation problem.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical processes in high-energy electrode materials often
   involve diffusion of multiple species and solid-state phase
   transformations. Some of these phase transformations involve breaking
   and rearranging ionic bonds and are referred to as conversion reactions
   (e.g., the lithium and iron difluoride conversion reaction: 2Li(+) +
   2e(-) + FeF2 -> 2LiF + Fe). The phase transformations during conversion
   processes are governed by fundamental thermodynamics and kinetics in a
   similar manner to metallurgical systems. In this work, we developed a
   phase-field model that tracks atomic fractions of three constituent
   species to simulate the morphological evolution of different phases. The
   simulations demonstrate that conversion proceeds via a two-stage process
   consisting of lithiation and decomposition stages, whereas the
   reconversion process consists of a single-stage delithiation. This
   asymmetry in evolution paths of conversion and reconversion is likely
   responsible for the voltage hysteresis commonly observed during
   lithiation-delithiation cycling of conversion materials.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{While metal is the most common conducting constituent element in the
   fabrication of metamaterials, graphene provides another useful building
   block, that is, a truly two-dimensional conducting sheet whose
   conductivity can be controlled by doping. Here we report the
   experimental realization of a multilayer structure of alternating
   graphene and Al2O3 layers, a structure similar to the metal-dielectric
   multilayers commonly used in creating visible wavelength hyperbolic
   metamaterials. Chemical vapour deposited graphene rather than exfoliated
   or epitaxial graphene is used, because layer transfer methods are easily
   applied in fabrication. We employ a method of doping to increase the
   layer conductivity, and our analysis shows that the doped chemical
   vapour deposited graphene has good optical properties in the
   mid-infrared range. We therefore design the metamaterial for
   mid-infrared operation; our characterization with an infrared
   ellipsometer demonstrates that the metamaterial experiences an optical
   topological transition from elliptic to hyperbolic dispersion at a

Title = {{Multiscale deformations lead to high toughness and circularly polarized
   emission in helical nacre-like fibres}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Nacre-like composites have been investigated typically in the form of
   coatings or freestanding sheets. They demonstrated remarkable mechanical
   properties and are used as ultrastrong materials but macroscale fibres
   with nacre-like organization can improve mechanical properties even
   further. The fiber form or nacre can, simplify manufacturing and offer
   new functional properties unknown yet for other forms of biomimetic
   materials. Here we demonstrate that nacre-like fibres can be produced by
   shear-induced self-assembly of nanoplatelets. The synergy between two
   structural motifs-nanoscale brick-and-mortar stacking of platelets and
   microscale twisting of the fibres-gives rise to high stretchability
   (>400\%) and gravimetric toughness (640 J g(-1)). These unique
   mechanical properties originate from the multiscale deformation regime
   involving solid-state self-organization processes that lead to efficient
   energy dissipation. Incorporating luminescent CdTe nanowires into these
   fibres imparts the new property of mechanically tunable circularly
   polarized luminescence. The nacre-like fibres open a novel technological
   space for optomechanics of biomimetic composites, while their continuous
   spinning methodology makes scalable production realistic.}},

Title = {{Detuning and wave breaking during nonlinear surface wave focusing}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{215-223}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Using an energy focusing technique, several transient wave trains were
   generated in a two-dimensional wave flume to investigate their nonlinear
   evolution. By increasing the initial wave steepness (S-0), while all
   other parameters remained the same, non-breaking through breaking
   conditions were achieved. The experimental results demonstrated that the
   waves' initial steepness affected the focusing process significantly. As
   expected, the nonlinear effects on wave packets with a low initial
   steepness were very small. However, for cases with large initial
   steepness, nonlinearity increased causing the wave packet to focus and
   break prematurely, a ``detuning{''} process. As a result of the detuning
   process more than one breaker may occur, and more importantly when this
   ensues, energy loss was altered. It is found that for S-0 < 0.274, only
   one breaker occurred, and the energy loss increased with increased
   initial steepness. For larger steepness, two breakers occurred and the
   total energy loss remained nearly constant (similar to 17\%) as the
   initial steepness was increased. As the initial steepness was increased
   still further, a large plunging breaking was obtained with additional
   energy loss (4\%). These results suggest that the ``detuning{''} has a
   pronounced influence not only on the resulting wave field, but on the
   resulting energy loss. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The stability and profitability of the informal WEEE collector in
   developing countries: A case study of China}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{18-26}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Different attitudes and practices toward WEEE recovery and recycling are
   found in developed and developing countries. As the largest developing
   country in the world, China's WEEE is widely regarded as a valuable
   product, and the resources contained in it offer potential profit for
   informal collectors. Unlike the formal collectors, who are supported by
   the government, informal collectors can only rely on themselves.
   However, formal and informal collectors often comfortably coexist in
   developing countries and there are even cases of informal collectors
   dominating the market. Obsolete television (OW) in Beijing is employed
   as a case study. Questionnaire survey and multi-agent cost-benefit
   analysis are used to analyze the stability and profitability of the
   informal collector. The results show the following: (1) The factors of
   price, convenience and canonicity can affect consumers' motivations when
   selecting a collector, with price and convenience having the strongest
   impact. And informal collectors can better meet consumers' demands. (2)
   Stable cooperation within tier two collectors is formed by profit-driven
   individuals. The secondhand market can expand the profits of the
   first-tier collectors, while the remaining OW, which cannot be reused,
   is delivered to the middleman, ensuring that the first-tier collectors
   are not menaced from the ``rear{''}. (3) The informal backyard recycler
   expands the profit of the middleman. Meanwhile, the WEEE processing fund
   is mostly shared by collectors and intensifies the confusion of the
   recovery market. We then create a new fund system to improve the
   regulation of OTV recovery. To make formal collections work, we suggest
   that the government charges an extra 40 Yuan fund when consumers buy new
   TVs and distribute it to formal collectors in order to exclude the
   informal collectors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report the development, characterization, and validation of a peptide
   specific for the extracellular domain of HER2. This probe chemistry was
   developed for molecular imaging by using a structural model to select an
   optimal combination of amino acids that maximize the likelihood for
   unique hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with HER2 domain 3. The
   sequence KSPNPRF was identified and conjugated with either FITC or Cy5.5
   via a GGGSK linker using Fmoc-mediated solid-phase synthesis to
   demonstrate flexibility for this chemical structure to be labeled with
   different fluorophores. A scrambled sequence was developed for control
   by altering the conformationally rigid spacer and moving both
   hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids on the C-terminus. We validated
   peptide specificity for HER2 in knockdown and competition experiments
   using human colorectal cancer cells in vitro, and measured a binding
   affinity of k(d) = 21 nM and time constant of k = 0.14 min(-1) (7.14
   min). We used this peptide with either topical or intravenous
   administration in a preclinical model of colorectal cancer to
   demonstrate specific uptake in spontaneous adenomas and to show
   feasibility for real time in vivo imaging with near-infrared
   fluorescence. We used this peptide in immunofluorescence studies of
   human proximal colon specimens to evaluate specificity for sessile
   serrated and sporadic adenomas. Improved visualization can be used
   endoscopically to guide tissue biopsy and detect premalignant lesions
   that would otherwise be missed. Our peptide design for specificity to
   HER2 is promising for clinical translation in molecular imaging methods
   for early cancer detection.}},

   is about 53.2\% (1.19-2 GHz) and the gain variation in all directions of
   azimuth plane is less than 2 dB over the frequency band 1.2-1.9 GHz, and
   is increased to 2.8 dB at 2 GHz. The gain is almost constant over the

Abstract = {{A scalable parallel plane-wave time-domain (PWTD) algorithm for
   efficient and accurate analysis of transient scattering from

   communication patterns on very large numbers of processors by leveraging
   two mechanisms: 1) a hierarchical parallelization strategy to evenly
   distribute the computation and memory loads at all levels of the PWTD
   tree among processors and 2) a novel asynchronous communication scheme
   to reduce the cost and memory requirement of the communications between
   the processors. The efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm are
   demonstrated through its applications to the analysis of transient
   scattering from a perfect electrically conducting (PEC) sphere with a
   diameter of 70 wavelengths and a PEC square plate with a dimension of
   160 wavelengths. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is used to analyze
   transient fields scattered from realistic airplane and helicopter models

Abstract = {{We extend the 3-D numerical method of Maxwell's equation (NMM3D) for
   rough soil surface scattering from L-band to C-, X-, and Ku-bands. We
   illustrate the results for copolarization, cross-polarization, and
   polarization ratio (HH/VV). Copolarized and cross-polarized
   backscattering coefficients from NMM3D are analyzed for frequency
   dependence, incident angle dependence, and soil moisture dependence. We
   also cross compare results from analytical and empiricalmodels. The
   16x16 squared wavelength (lambda(2)) of rough surface is applied for
   NMM3D using 256 processors on NSF Extreme Science and Engineering
   Discovery Environment clusters. Polarization ratio, HH/VV, is studied to
   address the feature of dependence on frequency for same fields (same
   physical parameters for the model). HH/VV is shown useful to provide
   additional information to study land surface. Results from NMM3D are
   also validated with POLARSCAT measurement data-1. NMM3D shows good
   agreement with data and better performance while considering
   copolarization, cross-polarization, and polarization ratio (HH/VV)
   together. The key advancement in computation efficiency in this paper is
   the implementation of a physically based near-field precondition
   algorithm in NMM3D to accelerate parallel computation. With
   precondition, the computation time is faster by ten times for larger
   root-mean-square height.}},

Abstract = {{Subterahertz frequencies between 100 and 300 GHz remain an untapped
   portion of the frequency spectrum for many radar-and radiometer-based
   remote sensing applications. This can be attributed in part to the lack
   of knowledge of the phenomenology of signal interaction with terrain at
   these frequencies. This paper examines recently acquired polarimetric
   radar backscatter data of different types of surfaces using a newly
   constructed polarimetric instrumentation radar operating at 222 GHz. At
   this frequency bare surfaces such as asphalt and dirt are electrically
   rough with subsurface aggregate sizes comparable with the wavelength
   resulting in substantial volume and surface scattering. The data show
   strong backscatter responses from bare surfaces with angular dependence
   proportional to the cosine square of the incidence angle along with
   significant depolarization (between -8 and -4 dB). The data for
   vegetation-covered surfaces show weak dependence on incidence angle and
   appreciable depolarization (between -12 and -6 dB). Empirical models for
   bare and vegetation-covered surfaces are proposed.}},

Title = {{Boreal, Temperate, and Tropical Forests as Vicarious Calibration Sites

Abstract = {{We develop methods of using boreal, temperate, and tropical forests as
   vicarious calibration sites for spaceborne microwave radiometers. The
   extended sites and improved calibration techniques enable examining
   warm-scene performances as a complement to cold scenes over the ocean,
   providing information about scan-dependent biases, detecting and
   correcting possible calibration errors, and intercalibrating different
   radiometers. Specifically, this paper shows results as follows.
   Warm-scene calibration is expanded beyond previously utilized sites in
   the Amazon rainforest to include inland boreal and temperate forests, as
   well as forests in coastal and island regions. These additional sites
   increase the available warm-scene sample size by a factor of 30 compared
   with using Amazon rainforests alone, allowing more accurate and
   statistically robust calibration. In addition, their widespread
   near-global distribution enables near-continuous monitoring of
   radiometer performance, e.g., with a temporal resolution of almost once
   per day. Accurate warm-end vicarious calibration enables or enhances
   several new capabilities for radiometer characterization. Scan-dependent
   calibration biases that are present at the high end of a radiometer's
   dynamic range can, for the first time, be reliably detected and
   characterized. Using this method, we are able to detect the along-scan
   magnetic interference and edge-of-scan biases that are present in Global
   Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager (GMI) observations at warm
   brightness temperatures (TBs). Our techniques are able to detect and
   characterize very small calibration anomalies, e.g., a scandependent
   error in GMI with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.1 K. In general,
   scan-dependent performance and antenna pattern correction can be
   improved with better constraints at both the high and low ends of
   on-Earth observed TBs. Regional dependence and seasonal changes in the
   brightness and predictability of the forested calibration sites are
   detected and characterized. Calibration exhibits a dependence on
   latitude, most significantly at water vapor channels, where tropical
   regions are different from middle and high latitudinal regions. Although
   the root cause is still under investigation, its presence suggests that
   using limited sites could result in undesirable latitude-dependent
   calibration biases. The distribution of calibration sites shifts
   seasonally, which results from green-up of the vegetation canopy in
   summer and defoliation in winter, and from snow contamination.}},

Abstract = {{Increased tendon stiffness in response to mechanical loading is well
   established in young animals. Given that tendons stiffen with aging, we
   aimed to determine the effect of increased loading on tendons of old
   animals. We subjected 28-month-old mice to 10 weeks of uphill treadmill
   running; sedentary 8- and 28-month-old mice served as controls.
   Following training, plantaris tendon stiffness and modulus were reduced
   by approximately half, such that the values were not different from
   those of tendons from adult sedentary animals. The decrease in plantaris
   tendon stiffness was accompanied by a similar reduction in the levels of
   advanced glycation end-product protein adducts in tibialis anterior
   tendons of trained compared with sedentary old mice. In Achilles
   tendons, elevated mRNA levels for collagen type 1,
   matrix-metalloproteinase-8, and lysyl oxidase following training suggest
   that collagen turnover was likely also increased. The dramatic
   mechanical and structural changes induced by training occurred
   independent of changes in cell density or tendon morphology. Finally,
   Achilles tendon calcification was significantly reduced following
   exercise. These results demonstrate that, in response to exercise,
   tendons from old animals are capable of replacing damaged and
   dysfunctional components of extracellular matrix with tissue that is
   mechanically and structurally comparable to adult tissue. (c) 2015

Title = {{Balanced SSFP-Like Steady-State Imaging Using Small-Tip Fast Recovery
   With a Spectral Prewinding Pulse}},
Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{839-844}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Small-tip fast recovery (STFR) imaging has been proposed
   recently as a potential alternative to balanced steady-state free
   precession (bSSFP). STFR relies on a tailored ``tip-up{''}
   radio-frequency pulse to achieve comparable signal level as bSSFP, but
   with reduced banding artifacts and transient oscillations, and is
   compatible with magnetization-preparation pulses. Previous STFR
   implementations used twodimensional or three-dimensional pulses
   spatially tailored to the accumulated phase calculated from a B0 field
   map, making the steady-state STFR signal contain some T2{*} weighting.
   Here, we propose to replace the spatially tailored pulse with a recently
   introduced spectrally selective ``pre-winding{''} pulse that is
   precomputed to a target frequency range. The proposed
   ``spectral-STFR{''} sequence produces T2/T1-weighted images similar to
   bSSFP, but with reduced banding and potentially other benefits.
   Theory and Methods: We investigated the steady-state signal properties
   of spectral-STFR using simulations, and phantom and human volunteer
   experiments.
   Results: Our simulation and experimental results showed that the
   spectral-STFR sequence has similar signal level and tissue contrast as
   bSSFP, but has a wider passband and more consistent banding profiles
   across different tissues (e.g., less hyperintense signal at band edges
   for low flip angles). Care is needed in designing the spectral
   radio-frequency pulse to ensure that the small tip angle approximation
   holds during radio-frequency transmission.
   Conclusion: Spectral-STFR has similar tissue contrast as bSSFP but a
   wider passband and more consistent cerebrospinal fluid/brain tissue
   contrast across the passband. The spectral-STFR sequence is a potential
   alternative to bSSFP in some applications. Compared to a spatially
   tailored STFR sequence, spectral-STFR can be precomputed, is easier to
   implement in practice, and potentially has more uniform image contrast
   and minimal T2{*} weighting. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In a modern wireless communication system, signal amplification is
   critical for overcoming losses during multiple data
   transformations/processes and long-distance transmission. Common mode
   and differential mode are two fundamental amplification mechanisms, and
   they utilize totally different circuit configurations. In this paper, we
   report a new type of dual-gate graphene ambipolar device with capability
   of operating under both common and differential modes to realize signal
   amplification. The signal goes through two stages of modulation where
   the phase of signal can be individually modulated to be either in-phase
   or out-of-phase at two stages by exploiting the ambipolarity of
   graphene. As a result, both common and differential mode amplifications
   can be achieved within one single device, which is not possible in the
   conventional circuit configuration. In addition, a common-mode rejection
   ratio as high as 80 dB can be achieved, making it possible for low noise
   circuit application. These results open up new directions of
   graphene-based ambipolar electronics that greatly simplify the RF
   circuit complexity and the design of multifunction device operation.}},

   transplanted cells. TGF-beta 1 was delivered from layered scaffolds,
   with protein entrapped within an inner layer and outer layers designed
   for cell seeding and host tissue integration. Scaffolds were implanted
   into the epididymal fat pad, a site frequently used for cell
   transplantation. Expression of cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-12, and MCP-1
   were decreased by at least 40\% for scaffolds releasing TGF-beta 1
   relative to control scaffolds. This decrease in inflammatory cytokine
   production corresponded to a 60\% decrease in leukocyte infiltration.
   Transplantation of islets into diabetic mice on TGF-beta 1 scaffolds
   significantly improved the ability of syngeneic islets to control blood
   glucose levels within the first week of transplant and delayed rejection
   of allogeneic islets. Together, these studies emphasize the ability of
   localized TGF-beta 1 delivery to modulate the immune response to
   biomaterial implants and enhance cell function in cell-based therapies.

   should be taken in the implementation of the CBBO using the finite

   measures are used which can lead to mesh dependency. A method is
   proposed to enforce mesh objectivity for engineering strain,

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Interface management (IM) is an emerging construction management
   practice that industry finds necessary for megaprojects that have become
   more complex and global. Defined as the appropriate management of
   communications, relationships, and deliverables among stakeholders,
   effective IM is integral to project success. Yet, because it is an
   emerging discipline, IM implementation has varied widely across the
   industry. Furthermore, the effect of IM on project performance is still
   unclear. To address these gaps, the construction industry institute
   (CII) chartered a research team, to identify the current state of IM and
   to investigate the relationship between systematic IM and project
   performance. To accomplish this, the authors conducted structured
   interviews for 46 projects. The study results showed that IM practices
   are most often found in industrial projects, with dollar values of more
   than one billion. In addition, IM adoption is positively correlated with
   the project dollar value and number of interface stakeholders. In terms
   of performance, projects with systematic IM tend to have lower mean and
   less dispersed cost growth, compared with projects without systematic
   IM. These results contribute to an understanding of the potential
   benefits of IM and its appropriate application as it further develops
   and is used in practice. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   Projects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Extremely large, complex projects with numerous geographically
   distributed stakeholders experience substantial risks related to the
   interfaces among stakeholders. This is particularly true during project
   definition and design, where despite discrete deliverables across the
   interfaces, decisions require some iteration. Managing interfaces has
   become feasible with the advent of internet and electronic product and
   process-management systems to the extent that full-time
   interface-management (IM) positions exist in practice. However, IM lacks
   formal structure, integration with critical-path-method scheduling, and
   methods to identify high-risk interface points (IPs). Throughout this
   paper, a graph-based algorithm is developed to identify key IPs in the
   network of IPs in a capital project. Furthermore, a new approach is
   discussed to link the key IPs to the interface milestones to identify
   schedule-related risks and mitigate their adverse impact. The
   functionality of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated in an offshore
   model project. The contributions of this paper provide foundational
   material for further research in IM. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{The nature of defect clusters in Ni and Ni-50 Co-50 (NiCo) irradiated at
   room temperature with 2-16 MeV Ni ions is studied using asymptotic
   diffuse X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   Analysis of the scattering data provides separate size distributions for
   vacancy and interstitial type defect clusters, showing that both types
   of defect clusters have smaller sizes and higher densities in NiCo than
   in Ni. Diffuse scattering results show good quantitative agreement with
   TEM size distributions for cluster sizes greater than 2 nm in diameter,
   but we find that TEM under represents the number of defect clusters <= 2
   nm, which comprise the majority of vacancy clusters in NiCo.
   Interstitial dislocation loops and stacking fault tetrahedra are
   identified by TEM. Comparison of diffuse scattering lineshapes to those
   calculated for dislocation loops and SFI's indicates that most of the
   vacancy clusters are SFTs. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Self-ordered nanostructured films can be fabricated through an
   electrochemical oxidation process called anodization. These films, with
   features on the order of tens of nanometers, have potential applications
   ranging from solar cells to medical devices. The most widely examined
   anodic nanostructured film is nanoporous anodic alumina. Although
   several models have been developed to describe the growth and
   self-organization of nanoporous anodic alumina, none have captured the
   full range of observed behavior. Here, we present a multidimensional
   extension of a one-dimensional model of anodization, and its
   implementation utilizing the smoothed boundary and level set methods,
   which permit the simulation of a growing pore on a fixed, regular
   computational grid. The simulations capture much of the experimental
   behavior for a range of applied potentials and electrolyte pH values.
   Most importantly, the simulated pore geometry is shown to be insensitive
   to the electrolyte pH, as is observed experimentally but had not been
   captured in previous models. This improvement stems from the shift in
   the equilibrium concentration of adsorbed O2- and OH- species as the
   electrolyte pH changes. The absence of plastic flow in the model has
   been identified as a likely source of two primary differences between
   the simulation results and the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{To spatially control therapeutic gene delivery for potential tissue
   engineering applications, a biotin-avidin interaction strategy was
   applied to immobilize viral vectors on biomaterial scaffolds. Both
   adenoviral vectors and gelatin sponges were biotinylated and avidin was
   applied to link them in a virus-biotin-avidin-biotin-material (VBABM)
   arrangement. The tethered viral particles were stably maintained within
   scaffolds and SEM images illustrated that viral particles were evenly
   distributed in three-dimensional (3D) gelatin sponges. An in vivo study
   demonstrated that transgene expression was restricted to the implant
   sites only and transduction efficiency was improved using this
   conjugation method. For an orthotopic bone regeneration model,
   adenovirus encoding BMP-2 (AdBMP2) was immobilized to gelatin sponges
   before implanting into critical-sized bone defects in rat calvaria.
   Compared to gelatin sponges with AdBMP2 loaded in a freely suspended
   form, the VBABM method enhanced gene transfer and bone regeneration was
   significantly improved. These results suggest that biotin-avidin
   immobilization of viral vectors to biomaterial scaffolds may be an
   effective strategy to facilitate tissue regeneration. Copyright (c) 2013

Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{889-903}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for rapid generation of three-dimensional
   low-thrust trajectories that utilizes Fourier series for shaping the
   position vector. The generated trajectories are feasible with respect to
   the given thrust acceleration constraints. An objective function is
   defined representing the overall mission cost, i.e. minimum AV. Four
   missions from Earth to Mars, the near Earth asteroid 1989ML, comet
   Tempel 1 and asteroid Dionysus are considered for assessing the
   performance of the algorithm. The selected missions present a range of
   various difficulties with different levels of thrust acceleration
   constraints. The Fourier series technique is flexible in generating
   various shapes rather than using one global shape. The proposed method
   is capable of rapid generation of sub-optimal feasible trajectories that
   are totally different from and comparable to the solutions of the
   state-of-the-art three-dimensional shape-based methods. This feature is
   quite favorable at the preliminary stages of low-thrust mission designs
   where various trajectory alternatives are required. The results also
   show that the obtained trajectories can be used as initial guesses for
   high fidelity optimal control tools. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by

Abstract = {{Health information technology (IT) has opened exciting avenues for
   capturing, delivering and sharing data, and offers the potential to
   develop cost-effective, patient-focused applications. In recent years,
   there has been a proliferation of health IT applications such as
   outpatient portals. Rigorous evaluation is fundamental to ensure
   effectiveness and sustainability, as resistance to more widespread
   adoption of outpatient portals may be due to lack of user friendliness.
   Health IT applications that integrate with the existing electronic
   health record and present information in a condensed, user-friendly
   format could improve coordination of care and communication.
   Importantly, these applications should be developed systematically with
   appropriate methodological design and testing to ensure usefulness,
   adoption, and sustainability. Based on our prior work that identified
   numerous information needs and challenges of HCT, we developed an
   experimental prototype of a health IT tool, the BMT Roadmap. Our goal
   was to develop a tool that could be used in the real-world, daily
   practice of HCT patients and caregivers (users) in the inpatient
   setting. Herein, we examined the views, needs, and wants of users in the
   design and development process of the BMT Roadmap through user-centered
   Design Groups. Three important themes emerged: 1) perception of core
   features as beneficial (views), 2) alerting the design team to potential
   issues with the user interface (needs); and 3) providing a deeper
   understanding of the user experience in terms of wider psychosocial
   requirements (wants). These findings resulted in changes that led to an
   improved, functional BMT Roadmap product, which will be tested as an
   intervention in the pediatric HCT population in the fall of 2015
   (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02409121). (C) 2016 American Society for Blood

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{47-56}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) achieves extraordinary strength
   characteristics through optimization of the particle packing density of
   the cementitious matrix. The dense matrix also promotes exceptional
   durability properties and is arguably the biggest benefit of the
   material. A durable concrete enables structures to last longer, reduces
   the cost of maintenance and helps achieve a significantly more
   sustainable infrastructure. To assess the durability of UHPC, the
   performance of several non-proprietary blends are investigated by
   assessing the materials' resistance to freeze-thaw cycles, ingress of
   chlorides as well as the presence and distribution of air voids. The
   main experimental variables are cement type and the quantity of silica
   powder, which varies from 0\% to 25\% of the cement weight. All mixes
   displayed negligible chloride ion penetration and high resistance to
   freeze-thaw with mass loss well below the limit in over 60 cycles of
   freeze-thaw. Analysis of the test data indicates that the silica powder
   content has little influence on performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Constraining the source of mantle plumes}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{435}},
Pages = {{55-63}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{In order to link the geochemical signature of hot spot basalts to
   Earth's deep interior, it is first necessary to understand how plumes
   sample different regions of the mantle. Here, we investigate the
   relative amounts of deep and shallow mantle material that are entrained
   by an ascending plume and constrain its source region. The plumes are
   generated in a viscous syrup using an isolated heater for a range of
   Rayleigh numbers. The velocity fields are measured using stereoscopic
   Particle-Image Velocimetry, and the concept of the `vortex ring bubble'
   is used to provide an objective definition of the plume geometry. Using
   this plume geometry, the plume composition can be analysed in terms of
   the proportion of material that has been entrained from different
   depths. We show that the plume composition can be well described using a
   simple empirical relationship, which depends only on a single parameter,
   the sampling coefficient, s(c). High-s(c) plumes are composed of
   material which originated from very deep in the fluid domain, while
   low-s(c) plumes contain material entrained from a range of depths. The
   analysis is also used to show that the geometry of the plume can be
   described using a similarity solution, in agreement with previous
   studies. Finally, numerical simulations are used to vary both the
   Rayleigh number and viscosity contrast independently. The simulations
   allow us to predict the value of the sampling coefficient for mantle
   plumes; we find that as a plume reaches the lithosphere, 90\% of its
   composition has been derived from the lowermost 260-750 km in the
   mantle, and negligible amounts are derived from the shallow half of the
   lower mantle. This result implies that isotope geochemistry cannot
   provide direct information about this unsampled region, and that the
   various known geochemical reservoirs must lie in the deepest few hundred
   kilometres of the mantle. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background and study aims: To demonstrate the clinical use of
   amultimodal endoscope with a targeted fluorescently labeled peptide for
   quantitative detection of Barrett's neoplasia.
   Patients and methods: We studied 50 patients with Barrett's esophagus
   using a prototype multimodal endoscope with a fluorescently labeled
   peptide. Co-registered fluorescence and reflectance images were
   converted to ratios to correct for differences in distance and geometry
   over the image field of view. The ratio images were segmented using a
   unique threshold that maximized the variance between high and low
   intensities to localize regions of high grade dysplasia (HGD) and
   esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).
   Results: Early neoplasia (HGD and EAC) was identified with 94\%
   specificity and 96\% positive predictive value at a threshold of 1.49.
   The mean results for HGD and EAC were significantly greater than those
   for squamous/ Barrett's esophagus and low grade dysplasia by one-way
   analysis of variance (ANOVA). The receiver operator characteristic curve
   for detection of early neoplasia had an area under the curve of 0.884.
   No adverse events associated with the endoscope or peptide were found.
   Conclusion: A multimodal endoscope can quantify fluorescence images from
   targeted peptides to localize early Barrett's neoplasia.

Abstract = {{An important issue that has attracted the interest of academics and
   practitioners in both marketing and operations is, should pricing
   decisions be made by the firm or delegated to the salesforce? This
   problem has been addressed in the research literature based on the
   assumption that the exact risk aversion coefficients of the sales agents
   are known to the firm, which may not be true in most applications. In
   this paper, we study this problem but assuming that the risk aversion
   coefficients of agents are private information of the sales agents. For
   both centralized pricing and delegated pricing settings, the optimal
   compensation and pricing contracts are designed and the sensitivity
   analyses are conducted. An interesting finding is that the risk aversion
   and effort valuation have substitutable impacts on the pricing policy
   preference of the firm and the agents. Either strong risk aversion or
   high effort valuation can drive the firm and the agents to favor
   centralized pricing over delegated pricing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Because levator ani (LA) muscle injuries occur in approximately 13\% of
   all vaginal births, insights are needed to better prevent them. In Part
   I of this paper, we conducted an analysis of the bony and soft tissue
   factors contributing to the geometric ``capacity{''} of the maternal
   pelvis and pelvic floor to deliver a fetal head without incurring
   stretch injury of the maternal soft tissue. In Part II, we quantified
   the range in demand, represented by the variation in fetal head size and
   shape, placed on the maternal pelvic floor. In Part III, we analyzed the
   capacity-to-demand geometric ratio, g, in order to determine whether a
   mother can deliver a head of given size without stretch injury. The
   results of a Part I sensitivity analysis showed that initial soft tissue
   loop length (SL) had the greatest effect on maternal capacity, followed
   by the length of the soft tissue loop above the inferior pubic rami at
   ultimate crowning, then subpubic arch angle (SPAA) and head size, and
   finally the levator origin separation distance. We found the more caudal
   origin of the puborectal portion of the levator muscle helps to protect
   it from the stretch injuries commonly observed in the pubovisceral
   portion. Part II fetal head molding index (MI) and fetal head size
   revealed fetal head circumference values ranging from 253 to 351 mm,
   which would increase up to 11mm upon face presentation. The Part III
   capacity-demand analysis of g revealed that, based on geometry alone,
   the 10th percentile maternal capacity predicted injury for all head
   sizes, the 25th percentile maternal capacity could deliver half of all
   head sizes, while the 50th percentile maternal capacity could deliver a
   head of any size without injury. If ultrasound imaging could be
   operationalized to make measurements of ratio g, it might be used to
   usefully inform women on their level of risk for levator injury during
   vaginal birth.}},

Title = {{Gait Efficiency on an Uneven Surface Is Associated with Falls and Injury
   in Older Subjects with a Spectrum of Lower Limb Neuromuscular Function A
   Prospective Study}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to determine which gait
   measures on smooth and uneven surfaces predict falls and fall-related
   injuries in older subjects with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
   Design: Twenty-seven subjects (12 women) with a spectrum of peripheral
   nerve function ranging from normal to moderately severe diabetic
   peripheral neuropathy walked on smooth and uneven surfaces, with gait
   parameters determined by optoelectronic kinematic techniques. Falls and
   injuries were then determined prospectively over the following year.
   Results: Seventeen subjects (62.9\%) fell and 12 (44.4\%) sustained a
   fall-related injury. As compared with nonfallers, the subject group
   reporting any fall, as well as the subject group reporting fall-related
   injury, demonstrated decreased speed, greater step width (SW), shorter
   step length (SL), and greater SW-to-SL ratio (SW: SL) on both surfaces.
   Uneven surface SW: SL was the strongest predictor of falls (pseudo-r(2)
   = 0.65; P = 0.012) and remained so with inclusion of other relevant
   variables into the model. Post hoc analysis comparing injured with
   noninjured fallers showed no difference in any gait parameter.
   Conclusion: SW: SL on an uneven surface is the strongest predictor of
   falls and injuries in older subjects with a spectrum of peripheral
   neurologic function. Given the relationship between SW: SL and
   efficiency, older neuropathic patients at increased fall risk appear to
   sacrifice efficiency for stability on uneven surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Background aims. Cell-based therapies have made an impact on the
   treatment of osteoarthritis; however, the repair and regeneration of
   thick cartilage defects is an important and growing clinical problem.
   Next-generation therapies that combine cells with biomaterials may
   provide improved outcomes. We have developed modular microenvironments
   that mimic the composition of articular cartilage as a delivery system
   for consistently differentiated cells. Methods. Human bone marrow
   derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were embedded in modular microbeads
   consisting of agarose (AG) supplemented with 0\%, 10\% and 20\% collagen
   Type II (COL-II) using a water-in-oil emulsion technique. AG and
   AG/COL-II microbeads were characterized in terms of their structural
   integrity, size distribution and protein content. The viability of
   embedded MSC and their ability to differentiate into osteogenic,
   adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages over 3 weeks in culture were also
   assessed. Results. Microbeads made with <20\% COL-II were robust,
   generally spheroidal in shape and 80 +/- 10 pm in diameter. MSC
   viability in microbeads was consistently high over a week in culture,
   whereas viability in corresponding bulk hydrogels decreased with
   increasing COL-II content. Osteogenic differentiation of MSC was
   modestly supported in both AG and AG/COL-II microbeads, whereas
   adipogenic differentiation was strongly inhibited in COL-II containing
   microbeads. Chondrogenic differentiation of MSC was clearly promoted in
   microbeads containing COL-II, compared with pure AG matrices.
   Conclusions. Inclusion of collagen Type II in agarose matrices in
   microbead format can potentiate chondrogenic differentiation of human
   MSC. Such compositionally tailored microtissues may find utility for
   cell delivery in next generation cartilage repair therapies.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{The wavelength shift of single Bragg grating integrated into a waveguide
   in optical MEMS pressure sensors gives inaccurate result due to the
   cross sensitivity caused by multiple external factors including
   temperature. Novel dual waveguide Bragg gratings (WBGs)-based
   microelectromechanical system pressure sensors with silicon
   micromachined diaphragm are presented here. The sensor consists of a
   curved waveguide with two identical WBGs located on the diaphragm. When
   pressure is applied on the diaphragm, the pitch of the gratings changes,
   and hence, there is a shift in the corresponding Bragg wavelength. The
   effect of temperature is assumed to be the same for both the gratings.
   As temperature shifts the Bragg wavelength of the two gratings equally,
   the error due to the temperature change on pressure sensitivity is
   eliminated. This method of pressure measurement effectively cancels out
   the temperature sensitivity. Three different configurations of the
   sensor with circular, square, and rectangular diaphragms are designed
   and simulated using COMSOLMultiphysics. Pressure sensitivity for the
   circular diaphragm configuration is found to be 2.1 and 0.744 pm/Pa for
   the two gratings, which are higher than the square and rectangular
   diaphragm configuration. Hence, the circular diaphragm configuration is
   better suited for multiplexing. The temperature independent properties
   of the sensors as well as the adjustability of sensitivity and
   measurement range by means of altering the dimensions of the sensors are
   studied. The temperature sensitivity is the same for both the gratings
   and is found to be 11.6 ppm/degrees C. Using modulation techniques and
   suitable designs, these sensors find applications in remote distributed
   sensing.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation addresses concerns in micro-electrical discharge
   machining (EDM) such as high tool electrode preparation cost, tool
   electrode wear, and tool electrode compensation by proposing a new
   electrostatic field-induced electrolyte jet tool electrode. This method
   utilizes the theory that in a strong direct current electric field, the
   electrolyte at the capillary tube outlet can form a Taylor cone based on
   the balance of electric field force and surface tension. Coupled with
   the increase of electric field intensity, a very fine jet can eject from
   the tip of the Taylor cone, and this induced charge on the tip leads to
   a discharge to the workpiece which can remove debris from the workpiece
   surface. After the discharge, the induced charge at the tip is
   neutralized, leading to the surface tension outweighing the electric
   field force and the withdrawal of the fine jet. As a result, the cyclic
   pulse discharge process is generated. During the process, the tip of the
   fine jet serves as the tool electrode. This paper identifies this cyclic
   pulse electrolyte jet tool electrode generation and discharge process in
   action and tests the machining ability of this tool electrode on a
   silicon wafer. This electrolyte jet tool is also shown to have no wear
   or compensation issues, and the cost compared to conventional EDM is
   shown to be small.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of the impact of rail pressure and biodiesel fueling on
   exhaust particulate agglomerate morphology and primary particle (soot)
   nanostructure was conducted with a common-rail turbocharged direct
   injection diesel engine. The engine was operated at steady state on a
   dynamometer running at moderate speed with both low (30\%) and
   medium-high (60\%) fixed loads, and exhaust particulate was sampled for
   analysis. The fuels used were ultra-low sulfur diesel and its 20\% v/v
   blends with soybean methyl ester biodiesel. Fuel injection occurred in a
   single event around top dead center at three different injection
   pressures. Exhaust particulate samples were characterized with
   transmission electronic microscopy imaging, scanning mobility particle
   sizing, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray
   diffraction analysis. Particulate morphology and oxidative reactivity
   were found to vary significantly with both rail pressure and biodiesel
   blend level. Higher biodiesel content led to an increase in the primary
   particle size and oxidative reactivity but had no impact on nanoscale
   disorder in the as-received samples. For particulates generated with
   higher injection pressures, the initial oxidative reactivity increased,
   but there was no detectable correlation with primary particle size or
   nanoscale disorder.}},

   Consistent results were obtained on duplicate specimens using the two
   testing procedures. The cumulative size distribution of the air voids
   estimated from chord length measurement was satisfactorily represented
   by an S-shaped function from which the differential distribution can be

   Single Crystalline Ni and Ni Binary Alloys}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Energetic ions have been widely used to evaluate the irradiation
   tolerance of structural materials for nuclear power applications and to
   modify material properties. It is important to understand the defect
   production, annihilation and migration mechanisms during and after
   collision cascades. In this study, single crystalline pure nickel metal
   and single-phase concentrated solid solution alloys of 50\%Ni50\%Co
   (NiCo) and 50\%Ni50\%Fe (NiFe) without apparent preexisting defect sinks
   were employed to study defect dynamics under ion irradiation. Both
   cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy characterization (TEM)
   and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry channeling (RBS-C) spectra
   show that the range of radiation-induced defect clusters far exceed the
   theoretically predicted depth in all materials after high-dose
   irradiation. Defects in nickel migrate faster than in NiCo and NiFe.
   Both vacancy-type stacking fault tetrahedra (SFT) and interstitial loops
   coexist in the same region, which is consistent with molecular dynamics
   simulations. Kinetic activation relaxation technique (k-ART) simulations
   for nickel showed that small vacancy clusters, such as di-vacancies and
   tri-vacancies, created by collision cascades are highly mobile, even at
   room temperature. The slower migration of defects in the alloy along
   with more localized energy dissipation of the displacement cascade may
   lead to enhanced radiation tolerance.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Shape memory alloy (such as NiTi) cellular lattice structures are a new
   class of advanced materials with many potential applications. The cost
   of fabrication of these structures however is high. It is therefore
   necessary to develop modeling methods to predict the functional behavior
   of these alloys before fabrication. The main aim of the present study is
   to assess the effects of geometry, microstructural imperfections and
   material asymmetric response of dense shape memory alloys on the
   mechanical response of cellular structures. To this end, several
   cellular and dense NiTi samples are fabricated using a selective laser
   melting process. Both cellular and dense specimens were tested in
   compression in order to obtain their stress-strain response. For
   modeling purposes, a three -dimensional (3D) constitutive model based on
   microplane theory which is able to describe the material asymmetry was
   employed. Five finite element models based on unit cell and multi-cell
   methods were generated to predict the mechanical response of cellular
   lattices. The results show the considerable effects of the
   microstructural imperfections on the mechanical response of the cellular
   lattice structures. The asymmetric material response of the bulk
   material also affects the mechanical response of the corresponding
   cellular structure.}},

Abstract = {{Chebyshev and Legendre polynomial spectral methods are bedeviled by
   highly nonuniform grids. The separation between nearest neighbors of an
   N-point grid at the center of the interval is /2 larger than the spacing
   of a uniform grid with the same number of points. Quasi-Uniform Spectral
   Schemes (QUSS) redistribute grid points and choose basis functions in
   order to recover this factor of /2 as nearly as possible while retaining
   a high density of points near the endpoints to avoid the horrors of the
   Gibbs or Runge Phenomenon. Here, we introduce a systematic approach,
   dubbed mapped cosine bases, that embraces the widely used
   Kosloff/Tal-Ezer functions as a special case. The mapped cosine approach
   uses grid points x(j) that are the images of a uniform grid under the
   coordinate mapping x=inv(t). Here, we show how to generalize the
   well-known graphical construction of the Chebyshev grid using a circle
   to QUSS mappings using a generalized ellipse. This provides a way to
   visualize the maps and grids and the subtle differences between
   different mappings of the mapped cosine family. We illustrate and
   compare the Kosloff/Tal-Ezer map with two new maps that use elliptic
   integrals and Jacobian theta functions, respectively. We show that the
   elliptic integral grid is an asymptotic approximation to the usual grid
   for prolate spheroidal functions. This suggests the conjecture that one
   can obtain the benefits of a prolate basis without the complications of
   prolate functions by using mapped polynomials instead.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Interictal high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial
   EEG are a potential biomarker of epilepsy, but current automated HFO
   detectors require human review to remove artifacts. Our objective is to
   automatically redact false HFO detections, facilitating clinical use of
   interictal HFOs.
   Methods: Intracranial EEG data from 23 patients were processed with
   automated detectors of HFOs and artifacts. HFOs not concurrent with
   artifacts were labeled quality HFOs (qHFOs). Methods were validated by
   human review on a subset of 2000 events. The correlation of qHFO rates
   with the seizure onset zone (SOZ) was assessed via (1) a retrospective
   asymmetry measure and (2) a novel quasi-prospective algorithm to
   identify SOZ.
   Results: Human review estimated that less than 12\% of qHFOs are
   artifacts, whereas 78.5\% of redacted HFOs are artifacts. The qHFO rate
   was more correlated with SOZ (p = 0.020, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and
   resected volume (p = 0.0037) than baseline detections. Using qHFOs, our
   algorithm was able to determine SOZ in 60\% of the ILAE Class I
   patients, with all algorithmically-determined SOZs fully within the
   resected volumes.
   Conclusions: The algorithm reduced false-positive HFO detections,
   improving the precision of the HFO-biomarker.
   Significance: These methods provide a feasible strategy for HFO
   detection in real-time, continuous EEG with minimal human monitoring of
   data quality. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to reduce surface variation in face milling
   processes based on high-definition metrology (HDM) measurements. Our
   previous research has found and established the relations between
   surface variation patterns, cutting forces, and process variables. Based
   on the findings, this paper compares potential machining methods and
   finds that the approaches of varying feed rate and lateral cutter path
   planning are most feasible for surface variation control. By combining
   the two approaches, an algorithm is developed to reduce cutting force
   variation along the feed direction and circumferential direction,
   respectively, thereby reducing the surface variation. The varying feed
   method can effectively eliminate the surface variation along the feed
   direction, while the optimal cutter path approach balances the cutting
   loads on the cutter and contributes to reducing cutting force variation
   along feed direction. Case studies were conducted based on a cutting
   experiment to demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the
   surface flatness by 25\%. The cutter path adjustment algorithm was also
   implemented in an automotive engine plant leading to 15-25\% improvement
   in surface flatness.}},

Abstract = {{Energy filtering of charge carriers in a semiconducting matrix using
   atomically coherent nanostructures can lead to a significant improvement
   of the thermoelectric figure of merit of the resulting composite. In
   this work, several half-Heusler/full-Heusler (HH/FH) nanocomposites with
   general compositions Zr0.25Hf0.75Ni1+xSn1-ySby (0 <= x <= 0.15 and y =
   0.005, 0.01 and 0.025) were synthesized in order to investigate the
   behavior of extrinsic carriers at the HH/FH interfaces. Electronic
   transport data showed that energy filtering of carriers at the HH/FH
   interfaces in Zr0.25Hf0.75Ni1+xSn1-ySby samples strongly depends on the
   doping level (y value) as well as the energy levels occupied by impurity
   states in the samples. For example, it was found that carrier filtering
   at HH/FH interfaces is negligible in Zr0.25Hf0.75Ni1+xSn1-ySby (y=0.01
   and 0.025) composites where donor states originating from Sb dopant
   dominate electronic conduction. However, we observed a drastic decrease
   in the effective carrier density upon introduction of HH/FH interfaces
   for the mechanically alloyed Zr0.25Hf0.75Ni1+xSn0.995Sb0.005 samples
   where donor states from unintentional Fe impurities contribute the
   largest fraction of conduction electrons. This work demonstrates the
   ability to synergistically integrate the concepts of doping and energy
   filtering through nanostructuring for the optimization of electronic
   transport in semiconductors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the control problem for a shield tunneling
   machine under a rectification condition in order to attain the accuracy
   requirement. With the enormous size of the complicated construction
   environment, it is a challenging issue to regulate attitude with high
   precision for practical tunneling. The difficulty is attributed to two
   main factors: the uncertain load acting on the shield body which is
   unavailable in advance and nonlinear factors caused by the hydraulic
   actuators, such as saturation, hysteresis and time delay. To tackle
   these problems, we propose a double closed-loop control strategy. First,
   with the aid of the equivalent load, a dynamic model in the case of
   regulating attitude is established; second, an adaptive sliding mode
   controller is presented by means of a synthesizing gradient algorithm
   and variable structure technology, as well as the stabilities of overall
   system are performed in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory and
   LaSalle's invariant principle; lastly, a thrust controller is proposed
   to make the hydraulic cylinders track the desired thrust force
   trajectories where the saturation of the hydraulic actuators is
   considered. Numerical simulations verify that the proposed double
   closed-loop control structure is simple but effective, which yields a
   potential value for a practical shield tunneling machine subject to
   actuator saturation constraints.}},

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{989-994}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Iopromide is an X-ray and MRI contrast agent that is virtually
   non-biodegradable and persistent through typical wastewater treatment
   processes. This study determined whether molecular transformation of
   iopromide in a UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP) can result in
   biodegradable products. The experiments used iopromide labeled with
   carbon-14 on the aromatic ring to trace degradation of iopromide through
   UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation and subsequent biodegradation. The
   biotransformation assay tracked the formation of radiolabeled (CO2)-C-14
   which indicated full mineralization of the molecule. The results
   indicated that AOP formed biodegradable iopromide products. There was no
   C-14 released from the pre-AOP samples, but up to 20\% of all
   radiolabeled carbon transformed into (CO2)-C-14 over the course of 42
   days of biodegradation after iopromide was exposed to advanced oxidation
   (compared to 10\% transformation in inactivated post-AOP controls). In
   addition, the quantum yield of photolysis of iopromide was determined
   using low pressure (LP) and medium pressure (MP) mercury lamps as 0.069
   +/- 0.005 and 0.080 +/- 0.007 respectively. The difference in the
   quantum yields for the two UV sources was not statistically significant
   at the 95\% confidence interval (p = 0.08), which indicates the
   equivalency of using LP or MP UV sources for iopromide treatment. The
   reaction rate between iopromide and hydroxyl radicals was measured to be
   (2.5 +/- 0.2) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). These results indicate that direct
   photolysis is a dominant degradation pathway in UV/H2O2 AOP treatment of
   iopromide. Other iodinated contrast media may also become biodegradable
   after exposure to UV or UV/H2O2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{106-118}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We formulate and develop a control method for homogeneous charge
   compression ignition (HCCI) engines using model predictive control (MPC)
   and models learned from operational data. An HCCI engine is a highly
   efficient but complex combustion system that operates with a high fuel
   efficiency and reduced emissions compared to the present technology.
   HCCI control is a nonlinear, multi-input multi-output problem with state
   and actuator constraints which makes controller design a challenging
   task. In this paper, we propose an MPC approach where the constraints
   are elegantly included in the control problem along with optimality in
   control. We develop the engine models using experimental data so that
   the complexity and time involved in the modeling process can be reduced.
   An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used to capture the engine dynamic
   behavior and is used by the MPC controller to evaluate control actions.
   We also used a simplified quadratic programming making use of the
   convexity of the MPC problem so that the algorithm can be implemented on
   the engine control unit that is limited in memory. The working and
   effectiveness of the proposed MPC methodology has been analyzed in
   simulation using a nonlinear HCCI engine model. The controller tracks
   several reference signals taking into account the constraints defined by
   HCCI states, actuators and operational limits. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Although the traditional capacitated facility location model uses
   inflexible, limited capacities, facility managers often have many
   operational tools to extend capacity or to allow a facility to accept
   demands in excess of the capacity constraint for short periods of time.
   We present a mixed-integer program that captures these operational
   extensions. In particular, demands are not restricted by the capacity
   constraint, as we allow for unprocessed materials from one day to be
   held over in inventory and processed on a following day. We also
   consider demands at a daily level, which allows us to explicitly
   incorporate the daily variation in, and possibly correlated nature of,
   demands. Large problem instances, in terms of the number of demand
   nodes, candidate nodes, and number of days in the time horizon, are
   generated from United States census population data. We demonstrate
   that, in some instances, optimal locations identified by the new model
   differ from those of the traditional capacitated facility location
   problem and result in significant cost savings.}},

Title = {{Designing and Harnessing the Metastable States of a Modular
   Metastructure for Programmable Mechanical Properties Adaptation}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on periodic metamaterial systems have shown that
   remarkable properties adaptivity and versatility are often the products
   of exploiting internal, coexisting metastable states. Motivated by this
   concept, this research develops and explores a local-global design
   framework wherein macroscopic system-level properties are sought
   according to a strategic periodic constituent composition and assembly.
   To this end and taking inspiration from recent insights in studies of
   multiphase composite materials and cytoskeletal actin networks, this
   study develops adaptable metastable modules that are assembled into
   modular metastructures, such that the latter are invested with
   synergistic features due to the strategic module development and
   integration. Using this approach, it is seen that modularity creates an
   accessible pathway to exploit metastable states for programmable
   metastructure adaptivity, including a near-continuous variation of
   mechanical properties or stable topologies and adjustable hysteresis. A
   model is developed to understand the source of the synergistic
   characteristics, and theoretical findings are found to be in good
   agreement with experimental results. Important design-based questions
   are raised regarding the modular metastructure concept, and a genetic
   algorithm (GA) routine is developed to elucidate the sensitivities of
   the properties variation with respect to the statistics amongst
   assembled module design variables. To obtain target multifunctionality
   and adaptivity, the routine discovers that particular degrees and types
   of modular heterogeneity are required. Future realizations of modular
   metastructures are discussed to illustrate the extensibility of the
   design concept and broad application base.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of gemcitabine plus
   radiation therapy (RT) in this phase 1 study of patients with newly
   diagnosed malignant glioma (HGG).
   Patients and Methods: Between 2004 and 2012, 29 adults with HGG were
   enrolled. After any extent of resection, RT (60 Gy over 6 weeks) was
   given concurrent with escalating doses of weekly gemcitabine. Using a
   time-to-event continual reassessment method, 5 dose levels were
   evaluated starting at 500 mg/m(2) during the last 2 weeks of RT and
   advanced stepwise into earlier weeks. The primary objective was to
   determine the recommended phase 2 dose of gemcitabine plus RT. Secondary
   objectives included progression-free survival, overall survival (OS),
   and long-term toxicity.
   Results: Median follow-up was 38.1 months (range, 8.9-117.5 months); 24
   patients were evaluable for toxicity. After 2005 when standard practice
   changed, patients with World Health Organization grade 4 tumors were no
   longer enrolled. Median progression-free survival for 22 patients with
   grade 3 tumors was 26.0 months (95\% confidence interval {[} CI]
   15.6-inestimable), and OS was 48.5 months (95\% CI 26.8-inestimable). In
   4 IDH mutated, 1p/19q codeleted patients, no failures occurred, with all
   but 1 alive at time of last follow-up. Seven with IDH mutated,
   non-codeleted tumors with ATRX loss had intermediate OS of 73.5 months
   (95\% CI 32.8-inestimable). Six nonmutated, non-codeleted patients had a
   median OS of 26.5 months (95\% CI 25.4-inestimable). The recommended
   phase 2 dose of gemcitabine plus RT was 750 mg/m(2)/wk given the last 4
   weeks of RT. Dose reductions were most commonly due to grade 3
   neutropenia; no grade 4 or 5 toxicities were seen.
   Conclusions: Gemcitabine concurrent with RT is well-tolerated and yields
   promising outcomes, including in patients with adverse molecular
   features. It is a candidate for further study, particularly for
   poor-prognosis patient subgroups with HGG. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time monitoring of the spatiotemporal evolution of tissue
   temperature is important to ensure safe and effective treatment in
   thermal therapies including hyperthermia and thermal ablation.
   Ultrasound thermography has been proposed as a non-invasive technique
   for temperature measurement, and accurate calibration of the
   temperature-dependent ultrasound signal changes against temperature is
   required. Here we report a method that uses infrared thermography for
   calibration and validation of ultrasound thermography. Using phantoms
   and cardiac tissue specimens subjected to high-intensity focused
   ultrasound heating, we simultaneously acquired ultrasound and infrared
   imaging data from the same surface plane of a sample. The commonly used
   echo time shift-based method was chosen to compute ultrasound
   thermometry. We first correlated the ultrasound echo time shifts with
   infrared-measured temperatures for material-dependent calibration and
   found that the calibration coefficient was positive for fat-mimicking
   phantom (1.49 +/- 0.27) but negative for tissue-mimicking phantom (20.59
   +/- 0.08) and cardiac tissue (20.69 +/- 0.18 degrees C-mm/ns). We then
   obtained the estimation error of the ultrasound thermometry by comparing
   against the infrared-measured temperature and revealed that the error
   increased with decreased size of the heated region. Consistent with
   previous findings, the echo time shifts were no longer linearly
   dependent on temperature beyond 45 degrees C-50 degrees C in cardiac
   tissues. Unlike previous studies in which thermocouples or water bath
   techniques were used to evaluate the performance of ultrasound
   thermography, our results indicate that high-resolution infrared
   thermography is a useful tool that can be applied to evaluate and
   understand the limitations of ultrasound thermography methods. (C) 2016

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel solution strategy for Saint-Venant's problem
   based on Hamilton's formalism. Saint-Venant's problem focuses on
   helicoidal beams and its solution hinges upon the determination of the
   subspace of the system's Hamiltonian matrix associated with its null and
   pure imaginary eigenvalues. A projection approach is proposed that
   reduces the system Hamiltonian matrix to a matrix of size 12 x 12, whose
   eigenvalues are identical to the null and purely imaginary eigenvalues
   of the original system, with the same Jordan structure. A fundamental
   theoretical result is established: Saint-Venant's solutions exist
   because rigid-body motions create no strains. Indeed, the solvability
   conditions for the governing equations of the problem are satisfied
   because a matrix identity holds, which expresses the fact that rigid-
   body motions create no strains. Because it avoids the identification of
   the Jordan structure of the original system, the implementation of the
   proposed projection for large, realistic problems is straightforward.
   Closed-form solutions of the reduced problem are found and
   three-dimensional stress and strain fields can be recovered from the
   closed-form solution. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate
   the capabilities of the analysis. Predictions are compared to exact
   solutions of three-dimensional elasticity and three-dimensional FEM
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Developing energy harvesting platforms that are strongly sensitive to

   This research examines these two factors in new light toward the

   Through theory and experiments, it is found that the strategic
   exploitation of such characteristics promotes dramatic improvements in
   the average power that may be generated for the same excitation
   conditions. Examining the origin of these performance enhancements, it
   is seen that large compliance in the compressed axial suspensions
   facilitates a favorable redistribution of dynamic energy, which thereby

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated that the energetic vibrations of
   strategically designed negative stiffness inclusions may lead to large
   and adaptable damping in structural/material systems. Many researchers
   examine these features using models of bistable elements. From the
   viewpoint of system integration, bistable, negative stiffness elements
   often interface with positive stiffness elastic members. Under such
   conditions, the structural/material system may exhibit coexisting
   metastable states. In other words, the macroscopic displacement/strain
   remains fixed while the reaction force may vary due to internal change,
   similar to a phase transition. This coexistence of metastable states is
   not manifested in an individual (stand-alone) bistable element. Although
   the static and low frequency linear dynamics of structural/material
   systems possessing coexisting metastable states have been explored, much
   remains to be understood regarding the dynamics and energy dissipation
   characteristics of such systems when excited near resonance, where
   nonlinear dynamics are more easily activated and damping design is of
   greater importance. Thus, to effectively elucidate the enhanced
   versatility of damping properties afforded by exploiting negative
   stiffness inclusions in structural/material systems, this research
   investigates a mechanical module which leverages a coexistence of
   metastable states: an archetypal building block for system assembly. The
   studies employ analytical, numerical, and experimental findings to probe
   how near-resonant excitation can trigger multiple dynamic states, each
   resulting in distinct energy dissipation features. It is shown that, for
   lightly damped metastable mechanical modules, the effective energy
   dissipation may be varied across orders of magnitude via tailoring

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the electrical properties of DC sputtered
   amorphous In-Sn-Zn-O (a-ITZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) fabricated
   under various process conditions. Fabricated a-ITZO TFTs achieved a
   threshold voltage (V-T) of 1.0 V, subthreshold swing (SS) of 0.38 V/dec
   and field-effect mobility (mu(eff)) of around 30 cm(2)/V s. An
   analytical field-effect mobility model is proposed for a-ITZO TFTs with
   key parameters extracted using different methods. The impacts of a-ITZO
   channel thickness and oxygen gas flow ratio on device performance were
   evaluated. Finally, the a-ITZO TFT bias-temperature stress (BTS) induced
   electrical instability was studied. In comparison to amorphous
   In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) TFTs, improved electrical stability was observed for
   a-ITZO TFTs using exactly the same BTS conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Phase Change Material (PCM) has been widely used in recent years for
   thermal storage devices, and PCMfilled metal matrix has become one of
   the common configurations that provide both a high thermal capacity and
   a faster heating/cooling cycle. A thermal storage device having a shell
   and tube arrangement was investigated in this paper. The shell contains
   paraffin wax saturated in aluminum foam. Effect of the porosity of
   aluminum foams on the thermal behavior of the system was investigated by
   comparing two foams with different porosity (95\% and 77\%). Both
   experimental measurements and numerical simulation were performed in
   this study. In addition, direct observation of the
   melting/solidification process of the paraffin wax was also made through
   visualization method. Measurement results were presented and compared
   with the model predicted solution fields, and good agreements were
   found. Results showed that the use of conducting matrix with PCM
   material significantly reduced the time needed for an operating cycle,
   and that the metal foam with less porosity further shortened the cycle
   due to higher overall thermal conductivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the kinetics of colloidal lock and key particle assembly
   by modeling transitions between free, non-specifically and specifically
   (dumbbells) bound pairs to enable the rapid formation of specific pairs.
   We expand on a model introduced in a previous publication
   (Colon-Melendez et al., 2015) to account for the shape complementarity
   between the lock and the key particle. Specifically we develop a theory
   to predict free energy differences between specific and non-specific
   states based on the interaction potential between arbitrary surfaces and
   apply this to the interaction of a spherical key particle with the
   concave dimple surface. Our results show that a lock particle dimple
   slightly wider than the key particle radius results in optimal binding,
   but also show escape rates much smaller than those observed in
   experimental measurements described in the paper cited above. We assess
   the possible sources of error in experiments and in analysis, including
   spatial and temporal resolution of the confocal microscopy method used
   to measure kinetic coefficients, the polydispersity of the lock dimple
   size, and the sedimentation of the particles in a quasi-two-dimensional
   layer. We find that the largest sources of variation are in the limited
   temporal resolution of the experiments, which we account for in our
   theory, and in the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the experiment that
   leads to misidentification of non-specific pairs as specific ones.
   Accounting for these sources of variation results in very good
   quantitative agreement with experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a refinement to the existing nucleation algorithm
   for a coupled conserved-nonconserved phase field model. In the new
   method, which offers greater ease of implementation as compared to the
   existing approach, only the nonconserved order parameter is modified to
   seed supercritical nuclei ( thus termed order-parameter-only seeding).
   The order- parameter-only seeding method naturally satisfies the
   conservation law for the conserved order parameter. In addition, the
   implementation within a finite element framework is described. The
   evolution of a single nucleus is examined to ensure that the precipitate
   growth kinetics are not affected by the seeding method. We find that,
   after a brief initial transient period, order- parameter-only nucleation
   yields similar precipitate growth characteristics to that of the
   existing model. The kinetics of a phase transformation exhibiting
   concurrent nucleation and growth is analyzed in the form of the Avrami
   equation, and a statistical analysis is performed to determine if mesh
   and/or time adaptivity affects the simulation results. The statistical
   analysis indicates that the nucleation algorithm is amenable to adaptive
   meshing and adaptive time stepping. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   cell}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{303}},
Pages = {{86-96}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{The thermal swelling of rechargeable lithium-ion battery cells is
   investigated as a function of the charge state and the charge/discharge
   rate. The thermal swelling shows significant dependency on the state of
   charge and the charge rate. The thermal swelling follows a quadratic
   form at low temperatures, and shows linear characteristics with respect
   to temperature at high temperatures in free-swelling conditions.
   Moreover, the equivalent coefficient of thermal expansion is much larger
   than that of each electrode and host materials, suggesting that the
   separator and the complex shape of the cell play a critical role in
   thermal expansion. Based on the experimental characterization, a novel
   thermal swelling model is proposed. The model introduces an equivalent
   coefficient of thermal expansion for the cell and also considers the
   temperature distribution throughout the battery by using heat transfer
   theory. The comparison between the proposed model and experiments
   demonstrates that the model accurately predicts thermal swelling at a
   variety of charge/discharge rates during operation and relaxation
   periods. The model is relatively simple yet very accurate. Hence, it can
   be useful for battery management applied to prolong the cycle life of
   cells and packs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-miRNA (anti-miR) oligonucleotide drugs are being developed to
   inhibit overactive miRNAs linked to disease. To help facilitate the
   transition from concept to clinic, new research tools are required. Here
   we report a novel method-miRNA Polysome Shift Assay (miPSA)-for direct
   measurement of miRNA engagement by anti-miR, which is more robust than
   conventional pharmacodynamics using downstream target gene derepression.
   The method takes advantage of size differences between active and
   inhibited miRNA complexes. Active miRNAs bind target mRNAs in high
   molecular weight polysome complexes, while inhibited miRNAs are
   sterically blocked by anti-miRs from forming this interaction. These two
   states can be assessed by fractionating tissue or cell lysates using
   differential ultracentrifugation through sucrose gradients. Accordingly,
   anti-miR treatment causes a specific shift of cognate miRNA from heavy
   to light density fractions. The magnitude of this shift is
   dose-responsive and maintains a linear relationship with downstream
   target gene derepression while providing a substantially higher dynamic
   window for aiding drug discovery. In contrast, we found that the
   commonly used `RT-interference' approach, which assumes that inhibited
   miRNA is undetectable by RT-qPCR, can yield unreliable results that
   poorly reflect the binding stoichiometry of anti-miR to miRNA. We also
   demonstrate that the miPSA has additional utility in assessing anti-miR
   cross-reactivity with miRNAs sharing similar seed sequences.}},

   cross section for ocean wind observations, and its altimetric
   performance is not optimized. The differences observed between measured
   and DTU10 SSH can be attributed to limitations with the GPS-R instrument
   and the lack of precision orbit determination by the TDS-1 platform.
   These results represent the first observations of SSH by a spaceborne
   GPS-R instrument.}},

Title = {{Pore orientation effects on the kinetics of mesostructure loss in
   surfactant templated titania thin films}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2896-2905}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{The mesostructure loss kinetics are measured as a function of the
   orientation of micelles in 2D hexagonal close packed (HCP) columnar
   mesostructured titania thin films using in situ grazing incidence small
   angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). Complementary supporting information is
   provided by ex situ scanning electron microscopy. Pluronic surfactant
   P123 acts as the template to synthesize HCP structured titania thin
   films. When the glass substrates are modified with crosslinked P123, the
   micelles of the HCP mesophase align orthogonal to the films, whereas a
   mix of parallel and orthogonal alignment is found on unmodified glass.
   The rate of mesostructure loss of orthogonally oriented (o-HCP) thin
   films (similar to 60 nm thickness) prepared on modified substrate is
   consistently found to be less by a factor of 2.5 +/- 0.35 than that
   measured for mixed orientation HCP films on unmodified substrates. The
   activation energy for mesostructure loss is only slightly greater for
   films on modified glass (155 +/- 25 kJ mol(-1)) than on unmodified (128
   kJ mol(-1)), which implies that the rate difference stems from a greater
   activation entropy for mesostructure loss in o-HCP titania films. Nearly
   perfect orthogonal orientation of micelles on modified surfaces
   contributes to the lower rate of mesostructure loss by supporting the
   anisotropic stresses that develop within the films during annealing due
   to continuous curing, sintering and crystallization into the anatase
   phase during high temperature calcination (>450 degrees C). Because the
   film thickness dictates the propagation of orientation throughout the
   films and the degree of confinement, thicker (similar to 250 nm) films
   cast onto P123-modified substrates have a much lower activation energy
   for mesostructure loss (89 +/- 27 kJ mol(-1)) due to the mix of
   orientations found in the films. Thus, this kinetic study shows that
   thin P123-templated o-HCP titania films are not only better able to
   achieve good orthogonal alignment of the mesophase relative to thicker
   films or films on unmodified substrates, but that alignment of the
   mesophase in the films stabilizes the mesophase against
   thermally-induced mesostructure loss.}},

   surfaces: exact solution to time-dependent Schrodinger Equation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Laser-driven ultrafast electron emission offers the possibility of
   manipulation and control of coherent electron motion in ultrashort
   spatiotemporal scales. Here, an analytical solution is constructed for
   the highly nonlinear electron emission from a dc biased metal surface
   illuminated by a single frequency laser, by solving the time-dependent
   Schrodinger equation exactly. The solution is valid for arbitrary
   combinations of dc electric field, laser electric field, laser
   frequency, metal work function and Fermi level. Various emission
   mechanisms, such as multiphoton absorption or emission, optical or dc
   field emission, are all included in this single formulation. The
   transition between different emission processes is analyzed in detail.
   The time-dependent emission current reveals that intense current
   modulation may be possible even with a low intensity laser, by merely
   increasing the applied dc bias. The results provide insights into the
   electron pulse generation and manipulation for many novel applications
   based on ultrafast laser-induced electron emission.}},

Abstract = {{Extremophile archaeal organisms overcome problems of membrane
   permeability by producing lipids with structural elements that
   putatively improve membrane integrity compared to lipids from other life
   forms. Herein, we describe a series of lipids that mimic some key
   structural features of archaeal lipids, such as: 1) single tethering of
   lipid tails to create fully transmembrane tetraether lipids and 2) the
   incorporation of small rings into these tethered segments. We found that
   membranes formed from pure tetraether lipids leaked small ions at a rate
   that was about two orders of magnitude slower than common
   bilayer-forming lipids. Incorporation of cyclopentane rings into the
   tetraether lipids did not affect membrane leakage, whereas a cyclohexane
   ring reduced leakage by an additional 40\%. These results show that
   mimicking certain structural features of natural archaeal lipids results
   in improved membrane integrity, which may help overcome limitations of
   many current lipid-based technologies.}},

Title = {{Origins of enhanced thermoelectric power factor in topologically

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},

Abstract = {{In this research, we report the enhanced thermoelectric power factor in
   topologically insulating thin films of Bi0.64Sb1.36Te3 with a thickness
   of 6-200 nm. Measurements of scanning tunneling spectroscopy and
   electronic transport show that the Fermi level lies close to the valence
   band edge, and that the topological surface state (TSS) is electron
   dominated. We find that the Seebeck coefficient of the 6nm and 15 nm
   thick films is dominated by the valence band, while the TSS chiefly
   contributes to the electrical conductivity. In contrast, the electronic
   transport of the reference 200nm thick film behaves similar to bulk
   thermoelectric materials with low carrier concentration, implying the
   effect of the TSS on the electronic transport is merely prominent in the
   thin region. The conductivity of the 6 nm and 15nm thick film is
   obviously higher than that in the 200 nm thick film owing to the highly
   mobile TSS conduction channel. As a consequence of the enhanced
   electrical conductivity and the suppressed bipolar effect in transport
   properties for the 6nm thick film, an impressive power factor of about
   2.0 mW m(-1) K-2 is achieved at room temperature for this film. Further
   investigations of the electronic transport properties of TSS and

Abstract = {{The broadband Green's function with low wavenumber extraction (BBGFL) is
   applied to the calculations of band diagrams of two-dimensional (2D)
   periodic structures with dielectric scatterers. Periodic Green's
   functions of both the background and the scatterers are used to
   formulate the dual surface integral equations by approaching the surface
   of the scatterer from outside and inside the scatterer. The BBGFL are
   applied to both periodic Green's functions. By subtracting a low
   wavenumber component of the periodic Green's functions, the broadband
   part of the Green's functions converge with a small number of Bloch
   waves. The method of Moment (MoM) is applied to convert the surface
   integral equations to a matrix eigenvalue problem. Using the BBGFL, a
   linear eigenvalue problem is obtained with all the eigenmodes computed
   simultaneously giving the multiband results at a point in the Brillouin
   zone Numerical results are illustrated for the honeycomb structure. The
   results of the band diagrams are in good agreement with the planewave
   method and the Korringa Kohn Rostoker (KKR) method. By using the lowest
   band around the G point, the low frequency dispersion relations are
   calculated which also give the effective propagation constants and the
   effective permittivity in the low frequency limit. (C) 2016 Optical

Title = {{Image patch analysis of sunspots and active regions I. Intrinsic
   dimension and correlation analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPACE WEATHER AND SPACE CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Context. The flare productivity of an active region is observed to be
   related to its spatial complexity. Mount Wilson or McIntosh sunspot
   classifications measure such complexity but in a categorical way, and
   may therefore not use all the information present in the observations.
   Moreover, such categorical schemes hinder a systematic study of an
   active region's evolution for example.
   Aims. We propose fine-scale quantitative descriptors for an active
   region's complexity and relate them to the Mount Wilson classification.
   We analyze the local correlation structure within continuum and
   magnetogram data, as well as the cross-correlation between continuum and
   magnetogram data.
   Methods. We compute the intrinsic dimension, partial correlation, and
   canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of image patches of continuum and
   magnetogram active region images taken from the SOHO-MDI instrument. We
   use masks of sunspots derived from continuum as well as larger masks of
   magnetic active regions derived from magnetogram to analyze separately
   the core part of an active region from its surrounding part.
   Results. We find relationships between the complexity of an active
   region as measured by its Mount Wilson classification and the intrinsic
   dimension of its image patches. Partial correlation patterns exhibit
   approximately a third-order Markov structure. CCA reveals different
   patterns of correlation between continuum and magnetogram within the
   sunspots and in the region surrounding the sunspots.
   Conclusions. Intrinsic dimension has the potential to distinguish simple
   from complex active regions. These results also pave the way for
   patch-based dictionary learning with a view toward automatic clustering
   of active regions.}},

Title = {{Image patch analysis of sunspots and active regions II. Clustering via
   matrix factorization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPACE WEATHER AND SPACE CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Context. Separating active regions that are quiet from potentially
   eruptive ones is a key issue in Space Weather applications. Traditional
   classification schemes such as Mount Wilson and McIntosh have been
   effective in relating an active region large scale magnetic
   configuration to its ability to produce eruptive events. However, their
   qualitative nature prevents systematic studies of an active region's
   evolution for example.
   Aims. We introduce a new clustering of active regions that is based on
   the local geometry observed in Line of Sight magnetogram and continuum
   images.
   Methods. We use a reduced-dimension representation of an active region
   that is obtained by factoring the corresponding data matrix comprised of
   local image patches. Two factorizations can be compared via the
   definition of appropriate metrics on the resulting factors. The
   distances obtained from these metrics are then used to cluster the
   active regions.
   Results. We find that these metrics result in natural clusterings of
   active regions. The clusterings are related to large scale descriptors
   of an active region such as its size, its local magnetic field
   distribution, and its complexity as measured by the Mount Wilson
   classification scheme. We also find that including data focused on the
   neutral line of an active region can result in an increased
   correspondence between our clustering results and other active region
   descriptors such as the MountWilson classifications and the R-value.
   Conclusions. Matrix factorization of image patches is a promising new
   way of characterizing active regions. We provide some recommendations
   for which metrics, matrix factorization techniques, and regions of
   interest to use to study active regions.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, Box-Behnken design was used for investigating the
   influence of the main operating parameters (Argon flow rate: Ar,
   hydrogen flow rate: H-2 and arc current: I) on velocity and temperature
   of La2Ce2O7 inflight particle characteristics (i.e., mean velocity and
   temperature) during supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying (SAPS). The
   relationship between the particle characteristics and the composition
   and the microstructure of LC coating was investigated eventually. During
   spraying, the particle temperature and velocity were monitored by
   on-line diagnosis system. The results indicated that the particle
   velocity linearly increased with the increase of Ar, H-2 and I.I and the
   interaction between I and Ar and/or H-2 were the most important
   parameters which influenced the particle temperature. The content of
   Ce4+ in the as-sprayed coating rapidly decreased when the particle
   temperature increased from 2923 to 3036 degrees C, and then slowly
   decreased in the range of 3127-3218 degrees C. When the particle
   velocity fluctuation was less than 5\%, the porosity of as-sprayed
   coatings decreased with the increase of particle temperature, however,
   it increased with the increase of particle velocity. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{An individualized predictor of health and disease using paired reference
   and target samples}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Consider the problem of designing a panel of complex
   biomarkers to predict a patient's health or disease state when one can
   pair his or her current test sample, called a target sample, with the
   patient's previously acquired healthy sample, called a reference sample.
   As contrasted to a population averaged reference this reference sample
   is individualized. Automated predictor algorithms that compare and
   contrast the paired samples to each other could result in a new
   generation of test panels that compare to a person's healthy reference
   to enhance predictive accuracy. This paper develops such an
   individualized predictor and illustrates the added value of including
   the healthy reference for design of predictive gene expression panels.
   Results: The objective is to predict each subject's state of infection,
   e.g., neither exposed nor infected, exposed but not infected, pre-acute
   phase of infection, acute phase of infection, post-acute phase of
   infection. Using gene microarray data collected in a large scale
   serially sampled respiratory virus challenge study we quantify the
   diagnostic advantage of pairing a person's baseline reference with his
   or her target sample. The full study consists of 2886 microarray chips
   assaying 12,023 genes of 151 human volunteer subjects under 4 different
   inoculation regimes (HRV, RSV, H1N1, H3N2). We train (with
   cross-validation) reference-aided sparse multi-class classifier
   algorithms on this data to show that inclusion of a subject's reference
   sample can improve prediction accuracy by as much as 14 \%, for the H3N2
   cohort, and by at least 6 \%, for the H1N1 cohort. Remarkably, these
   gains in accuracy are achieved by using smaller panels of genes, e.g.,
   39 \% fewer for H3N2 and 31 \% fewer for H1N1. The biomarkers selected
   by the predictors fall into two categories: 1) contrasting genes that
   tend to differentially express between target and reference samples over
   the population; 2) reinforcement genes that remain constant over the two
   samples, which function as housekeeping normalization genes. Many of
   these genes are common to all 4 viruses and their roles in the predictor
   elucidate the function that they play in differentiating the different
   states of host immune response.
   Conclusions: If one uses a suitable mathematical prediction algorithm,
   inclusion of a healthy reference in biomarker diagnostic testing can
   potentially improve accuracy of disease prediction with fewer
   biomarkers.}},

Abstract = {{Creating a hierarchical interface between the reinforcement and matrix
   phases of fiber reinforced polymer composites has become an effective
   strategy toward development of bioinspired structural composites. The
   resulting materials display exceptional characteristics such as having
   both high stiffness and high toughness simultaneously, which is rare in
   homogeneous materials. Although the efficacy of nanostructured
   interfaces has been established, the mechanisms associated with their
   performance have not been explored yet. Here, strain transfer across a
   nanowire interphase is visualized in order to understand the working
   principles of physical interface modifications. This is accomplished by
   using a functionally graded piezoelectric interface composed of
   nanowires, as their piezoelectric properties can be utilized to control
   the strain on one side of the interface. It is demonstrated that the
   nanowire ``whiskers{''} cause an even strain transfer from the
   reinforcement phase into the matrix phase, eliminating stress
   concentration between the phases.}},

Abstract = {{Nanodroplet-mediated histotripsy (NMH) is an ultrasound ablation
   technique combining histotripsy with acoustically sensitive
   perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanodroplets that can be selectively delivered to
   tumor cells for targeted tumor ablation. NMH takes advantage of the
   significantly reduced cavitation threshold of the nanodroplets, allowing
   for cavitation to be selectively generated only in regions containing
   nanodroplets. Understanding the physical mechanisms underlying the
   nanodroplet cavitation process is essential to the development of NMH.
   In this study, we hypothesize that cavitation nucleation is caused by
   the negative pressure (p-) exposed to the PFC, and the NMH cavitation
   threshold is therefore determined by the incident p- of the single-cycle
   pulses commonly used in NMH. This paper reports the first study that
   separately investigates the effects of negative and positive pressure on
   the NMH cavitation threshold using near half-cycle ultrasound pulses
   with dominant negative (negative-polarity pulses) or positive
   (positive-polarity pulses) pressure phases. Tissue phantoms containing
   perfluorohexane (PFH) nanodroplets were exposed to negative-polarity and
   positive-polarity pulses generated by a frequency compounding transducer
   recently developed in our lab, and the probability of generating
   cavitation was measured as a function of peak negative (p-) and peak
   positive (p+) pressure. The results showed close agreement in the
   p-cavitation threshold for PFH phantoms exposed to negative-polarity
   (11.4 +/- 0.1 MPa) and positive-polarity (11.7 +/- 0.2 MPa) pulses. The
   p+ at the cavitation threshold, in contrast, was measured to be
   significantly different for the negative-polarity (4.0 +/- 0.1 MPa) and
   positive-polarity (42.6 +/- 0.2 MPa) pulses. In the final part of this
   study, the experimental results were compared to the cavitation
   threshold predicted by classical nucleation theory (CNT), with results
   showing close agreement between simulations and experiments. Overall,
   the results support our hypothesis and provide significant insight into
   the physical mechanisms underlying NMH.}},

Abstract = {{The suppression of inappropriate actions is critical for flexible
   behavior. Cortical-basal ganglia networks provide key gating mechanisms
   for action suppression, yet the specific roles of neuronal
   subpopulations are poorly understood. Here, we examine Arkypallidal
   ({''}Arky'') and Prototypical ({''}Proto'') globus pallidus neurons
   during a Stop task, which requires abrupt cancellation of an imminent
   action. We first establish that Arky neurons can be identified by their
   firing properties across the natural sleep/wake cycle. We then show that
   Stop responses are earlier and stronger in the Arky compared to the
   Proto subpopulation. In contrast to other basal ganglia neurons,
   pallidal Stop responses are selective to Stop, rather than Go, cues.
   Furthermore, the timing of these Stop responses matches the suppression
   of developing striatal Go-related activity. Our results support a
   two-step model of action suppression: actions-inpreparation are first
   paused via a subthalamic-nigral pathway, then cancelled via Arky
   GABAergic projections to striatum.}},

Abstract = {{The stability and kinetics of the Li-Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) interface were
   characterized as a function of temperature and current density.
   Polycrystalline LLZO was densified using a rapid hot-pressing technique
   achieving 97.1 +/- 1\% relative density, and <10\% grain boundary
   resistance; effectively consisting of an ensemble of single LLZO
   crystals. It was determined that by heating to 175 degrees C, the room
   temperature Li-LIZO interface resistance decreases dramatically from
   5822 (as-assembled) to 514 0 cm2; a > 10-fold decrease. In
   characterizing the maximum sustainable current density (or critical
   current density - CCD) of the Li-LLZO interface, several signs of
   degradation were observed. In DC cycling tests, significant deviation
   from Ohmic behavior was observed. In post-cycling tests, regions of
   metallic Li were observed; propagating parallel to the ionic current.
   For the cells cycled at 30, 70, 100, 130 and 160 degrees C, the CCD was
   determined to be 50, 200, 800, 3500, and 20000 mu A cm(-2),
   respectively. The relationships and phenomena observed in this work can
   be used to better understand the Li-LLZO interface stability, enabling
   the use of batteries employing Li metal anodes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{A bioenergetic approach to manage production and control phosphorus
   discharges from a salmonid hatchery}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{451}},
Pages = {{137-146}},

Abstract = {{The environmental effects of fish culture operations are important
   issues in Michigan as well as many other parts of the world. The State
   of Michigan Department of Natural Resources operates the Platte River
   State Fish Hatchery (PRSFH) located near Honor, Michigan (USA). This
   facility has a restrictive discharge permit that limits the input of
   phosphorus into the Platte River that subsequently drains into a
   downstream oligotrophic lake (Platte Lake). The permit has been violated
   on occasion in recent years. Hatchery managers and operators need to
   understand the cause of these violations and prevent them in the future;
   and at the same time meet production goals to satisfy fishery management
   objectives. This paper describes the development and application of
   models designed to quantitatively analyze these issues. First, a
   bioenergetic growth and consumption model is developed for juvenile coho
   (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) salmon to
   quantify the relationship between fish production and by-product
   phosphorus loads. Next, phosphorus mass balance equations are used to
   calculate the phosphorus discharge from the facility as a function of
   the by-product phosphorus load and the efficiency of various phosphorus
   removal equipment and processes. The accuracy and consistency of the
   energy and mass balance equations are verified using extensive
   measurements. The ability of the model to successfully match various
   aspects of system performance supports the contention that the
   bioenergetic modeling approach developed here can provide reliable
   estimates of salmonid growth and feed requirements for a variety of food
   compositions, rations, and temperatures. This capability, along with
   knowledge of the effectiveness of phosphorus removal equipment, forms
   the basis of a practical operational and management tool. An example of
   model utility is presented that analyzes the PRSFH phosphorus discharge
   and provides insights into why permit violations occurred in 2009 but
   not in 2010. The model demonstrates how to avoid food waste caused by
   over feeding, lower the food conversion ratio, and evaluate the
   effectiveness of phosphorus removal treatment processes. A steady-state
   version of the model can be used by managers to establish production
   goals that avoid future violations of the phosphorus discharge limits.

Abstract = {{Microdialysis sampling is an essential tool for in vivo neurochemical
   monitoring. Conventional dialysis probes are over 220 mu m in diameter
   and have limited flexibility in design because they are made by assembly
   using preformed membranes. The probe size constrains spatial resolution
   and governs the amount of tissue damaged caused by probe insertion. To
   overcome these limitations, we have developed a method to microfabricate
   probes in Si that are 45 mu m thick x 180 mu m wide. The probes contain
   a buried, U-shaped channel that is 30 mu m deep x 60 mu m wide and
   terminates in ports for external connection. A 4 mm length of the probe
   is covered with a 5 mu m thick nanoporous membrane. The membrane was
   microfabricated by deep reactive ion etching through a porous aluminum
   oxide layer. The microfabricated probe has cross-sectional area that is
   79\% less than that of the smallest conventional microdialysis probes.
   The probes yield 2-20\% relative recovery at 100 nL/min perfusion rate
   for a variety of small molecules. The probe was successfully tested in
   vivo by sampling from the striatum of live rats. Fractions were
   collected at 20 min intervals (2 mu L) before and after an
   intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg amphetamine. Analysis of fractions
   by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed reliable detection
   of 14 neurochemicals, including dopamine and acetylcholine, at basal
   conditions. Amphetamine evoked a 43-fold rise in dopamine, a result
   nearly identical to a conventional dialysis probe in the same animal.
   The microfabricated probes have potential for sampling with higher
   spatial resolution and less tissue disruption than conventional probes.
   It may also be possible to add functionality to the probes by
   integrating other components, such as electrodes, optics, and additional
   channels.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of energy storage technologies to the grid could enable
   greater integration of renewables, improve system resilience and
   reliability, and offer cost effective alternatives to transmission and
   distribution upgrades. The integration of energy storage systems into
   the electrical grid can lead to different environmental outcomes based
   on the grid application, the existing generation mix, and the demand.
   Given this complexity, a framework is needed to systematically inform
   design and technology selection about the environmental impacts that
   emerge when considering energy storage options to improve sustainability
   performance of the grid. To achieve this, 12 fundamental principles
   specific to the design and grid application of energy storage systems
   are developed to inform policy makers, designers, and operators. The
   principles are grouped into three categories: (1) system integration for
   grid applications, (2) the maintenance and operation of energy storage,
   and (3) the design of energy storage systems. We illustrate the
   application of each principle through examples published in the academic
   literature, illustrative calculations, and a case study with an off-grid
   application of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). In addition,
   trade-offs that can emerge between principles are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{A capability of absorbing a broad range of visible lights is essential
   to boost the performance of various applications, such as photovoltaics
   (PV), photodetectors, and thermal emitters. Here, we present an
   angle-insensitive, polarization-independent ultrathin (< 150 nm)
   broadband absorber in the visible regime exploiting strong interference
   behaviors in highly absorbing semiconductor materials. A proposed
   structure simply has four layers composed of two stacks of a metal and a
   semiconductor demonstrating a remarkably enhanced absorption property as
   compared with the device without a top semiconductor film. This is
   attributed to multi-cavity resonance effects in each cavity, which is
   obviously elucidated with phase calculations and electric field
   distributions. The maximum absorption efficiency of the device is 95.5\%
   at a resonance and its absorption characteristic can be maintained over
   a wide angle of incidence up to +/- 70 degrees regardless of the
   incident light polarization. Finally, we investigate how our approach
   can be utilized to achieve a tandem PV cell with high efficiency. Our
   strategy can be applied to other material systems and can be useful in
   diverse applications, including thermal emitters and PV. (C) 2016 AIP

   TiCl3 and VCl3 sheets}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 18}},
Abstract = {{Half-metallicity combined with wide half-metallic gap, unique
   ferromagnetic character and high Curie temperature has become a key
   driving force to develop next-generation spintronic devices. In previous
   studies, such half-metallicity always occurred under certain
   manipulation. Here, we, via examining a series of two-dimensional
   transition-metal trichlorides, evidenced that TiCl3 and VCl3 sheets
   could display exciting half-metallicity without involving any external
   modification. Calculated half-metallic band-gaps for TiCl3 and VCl3
   sheets are about 0.60 and 1.10 eV, respectively. Magnetic coupled
   calculation shows that both sheets favor the ferromagnetic order with a
   substantial collective character. Estimated Curie temperatures can be up
   to 376 and 425 K for TiCl3 and VCl3 sheets, respectively. All of these
   results successfully disclose two new promising two-dimensional
   half-metallic materials toward the application of next-generation
   paper-like spintronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations in the microtubule cytoskeleton are linked to cognitive and
   locomotor defects during development, and neurodegeneration in adults.
   How these mutations impact microtubules, and how this alters function at
   the level of neurons is an important area of investigation. Using a
   forward genetic screen in mice, we identified a missense mutation in
   Tuba1a alpha-tubulin that disrupts cortical and motor neuron
   development. Homozygous mutant mice exhibit cortical dysgenesis
   reminiscent of human tubulinopathies. Motor neurons fail to innervate
   target muscles in the limbs and show synapse defects at proximal
   targets. To directly examine effects on tubulin function, we created
   analogous mutations in the alpha-tubulin isotypes in budding yeast.
   These mutations sensitize yeast cells to microtubule stresses including
   depolymerizing drugs and low temperatures. Furthermore, we find that
   mutant alpha-tubulin is depleted from the cell lysate and from
   microtubules, thereby altering ratios of alpha-tubulin isotypes.
   Tubulin-binding cofactors suppress the effects of the mutation,
   indicating an important role for these cofactors in regulating the
   quality of the alpha-tubulin pool. Together, our results give new
   insights into the functions of Tuba1a, mechanisms for regulating tubulin
   proteostasis, and how compromising these may lead to neural defects. (C)

Abstract = {{In the study of networked systems such as biological, technological, and
   social networks the available data are often uncertain. Rather than
   knowing the structure of a network exactly, we know the connections
   between nodes only with a certain probability. In this paper we develop
   methods for the analysis of such uncertain data, focusing particularly
   on the problem of community detection. We give a principled
   maximum-likelihood method for inferring community structure and
   demonstrate how the results can be used to make improved estimates of
   the true structure of the network. Using computer-generated benchmark
   networks we demonstrate that our methods are able to reconstruct known
   communities more accurately than previous approaches based on data
   thresholding. We also give an example application to the detection of
   communities in a protein-protein interaction network.}},

Abstract = {{Damage initiation during cycling loading of polycrystalline metallic
   alloys involves localized damage at the scale of individual grains. To
   better understand damage processes and to build models for material
   behavior, there is a need for quantitative assessment of the
   microstructural configurations that favor fatigue crack initiation. In
   materials that form annealing twins during processing, these special
   interfaces are often locations of particular interest for their role in
   strain and damage accumulation. In the present study, fatigue
   experiments in the very high and low cycle fatigue regime on a Rene 88DT
   polycrystalline nickelbase superalloy were performed to statistically
   evaluate grain-scale features that favor crack initiation. Combined
   elastic and plastic criteria at the grain scale have been developed. A
   crack distribution function is defined to compare and assess the effect
   of the microstructural parameters for the two fatigue regimes.

Abstract = {{Freeze-thaw resistance of high strength concrete (HSC) and normal
   strength concrete (NSC) mixes with varying air contents was investigated
   by moisture uptake, mass loss and internal damage measurements.
   Sufficiently air-entrained HSC mixes demonstrate significant improvement
   in salt frost scaling resistance and the characteristics of air-void
   system is not a major factor. This can be attributed to the reduced
   capillary porosity and connectivity which curtails ice-growth promoted
   by capillary suction of surface liquid under freezing. A clear bi-linear
   pattern is found for the mass loss and moisture uptake curves of HSC
   mixes, the transition point of which coincides with each other. This
   demonstrates the importance of initial moisture condition in concrete
   prior to F-T test. Increased imperviousness of HSC to moisture ingress
   renders it more prone to long-term frost damage intrinsically, which is
   evidenced by much higher initial freezing strain in HSC from the
   length-change measurement on thin specimens at various degrees of
   saturation levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   show that Ag-BG and DPSCs were successfully incorporated and

   proliferate up to 6-weeks in cell culture but cell differentiation into
   odontoblast-like cells was observed only in vivo. The beads containing
   Ag-BG strongly inhibit bacterial growth in the experimental groups

Volume = {{305}},

Abstract = {{We propose a modeling paradigm, termed field inversion and machine
   learning (FIML), that seeks to comprehensively harness data from sources
   such as high-fidelity simulations and experiments to aid the creation of
   improved closure models for computational physics applications. In
   contrast to inferring model parameters, this work uses inverse modeling
   to obtain corrective, spatially distributed functional terms, offering a
   route to directly address model-form errors. Once the inference has been
   performed over a number of problems that are representative of the
   deficient physics in the closure model, machine learning techniques are
   used to reconstruct the model corrections in terms of variables that
   appear in the closure model. These reconstructed functional forms are
   then used to augment the closure model in a predictive computational
   setting. As a first demonstrative example, a scalar ordinary
   differential equation is considered, wherein the model equation has
   missing and deficient terms. Following this, the methodology is extended
   to the prediction of turbulent channel flow. In both of these
   applications, the approach is demonstrated to be able to successfully
   reconstruct functional corrections and yield accurate predictive
   solutions while providing a measure of model form uncertainties. (C)

Abstract = {{An epitaxy-directing solvent additive 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene is combined
   with an off-center spin-casting technique to produce
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) fibers with uniaxial in-plane alignment on

   is used to characterize planar heterojunction devices assembled from
   phenyl-C-61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) acceptor and both aligned
   and unaligned P3HT donor. By varying the relative positions of the laser
   spot (site of carrier generation) and probe (site of hole extraction),
   it is found that devices with aligned P3HT exhibit anisotropic and
   greatly enhanced long-range photocarrier transport, with nearly 10\% of
   original photocurrent measured 400 mm from the laser spot along the
   direction parallel to the alignment. Complementary thin film transistor
   (TFT) measurements reveal a factor of similar to 3.5 difference in the
   hole mobilities parallel and perpendicular to the direction of
   alignment. Together, these findings highlight the importance of
   macroscopic alignment as a strategy to overcome the low mobilities of
   disordered polymer semiconductors. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of aircraft noise is an important task of nowadays airports
   in order to fight environmental noise pollution given the recent
   discoveries on the exposure negative effects on human health. Noise
   monitoring and estimation around airports mostly use aircraft noise
   signals only for computing statistical indicators and depends on
   additional data sources so as to determine required inputs such as the
   aircraft class responsible for noise pollution. In this sense, the noise
   monitoring and estimation systems have been tried to improve by creating
   methods for obtaining more information from aircraft noise signals,
   especially real-time aircraft class recognition. Consequently, this
   paper proposes a multilayer neural-fuzzy model for aircraft class
   recognition based on take-off noise signal segmentation. It uses a fuzzy
   inference system to build a final response for each class p based on the
   aggregation of K parallel neural networks outputs O-p(k) with respect to
   Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) features extracted from K adjacent signal
   segments. Based on extensive experiments over two databases with
   real-time take-off noise measurements, the proposed model performs
   better than other methods in literature, particularly when aircraft
   classes are strongly correlated to each other. A new strictly
   cross-checked database is introduced including more complex classes and
   real-time take-off noise measurements from modern aircrafts. The new
   model is at least 5\% more accurate with respect to previous database
   and successfully classifies 87\% of measurements in the new database.

Abstract = {{Battery performance and its fade are determined by various aspects such
   as the transport of ions and electrons through heterogeneous internal
   structures; kinetic reactions at the interfaces; and the corresponding
   interplay between mechanical, chemical, and thermal responses. The
   fundamental factor determining this complex multiscale and multiphysical
   nature of a battery is the geometry of active materials. In this work,
   we systematically consider the tradeoffs among a selection of limiting
   geometries of media designed to store ions or other species via a
   diffusion process. Specifically, we begin the investigation by
   considering diffusion in spheres, rods, and plates at the particle
   level, in order to assess the effects of geometry, diffusivity, and rate
   on capacity. Then, the study is extended to considering of the volume
   fraction and particle network, as well as kinetics at the interface with
   electrolyte. Our study suggests that, in terms of overall bulk level
   material performance, thin film batteries may generate the highest
   energy density with high power capability when they are implemented at
   nanoscales or with highly diffusion materials. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Implantable microelectrode arrays have attracted considerable interest
   due to their high temporal and spatial resolution recording of neuronal
   activity in tissues. We herein presented an implantable multichannel
   neural probe with multiple real-time monitoring of neural-chemical and
   neural-electrical signals by a nonenzymatic neural-chemical interface,
   which was designed by creating the newly developed reduced graphene
   oxide-gold oxide (rGO/Au2O3) nanocomposite electrode. The modified
   electrode on the neural probe was prepared by a facile one-step cyclic
   voltammetry (CV) electrochemical method with simultaneous occurrence of
   gold oxidation and GOs reduction to induce the intimate attachment by
   electrostatic interaction using chloride ions (Cl-). The
   rGO/Au2O3-modified electrode at a low deposition scan rate of 10 mVs(-1)
   displayed significantly improved electrocatalytic activity due to large
   active areas and well-dispersive attached rGO sheets. The in vitro
   amperometric response to H2O2 demonstrated a fast response of less than
   5 s and a very low detection limit of 0.63 mu M. In in vivo hyperacute
   stroke model, the concentration of H2O2 was measured as 100.48 +/- 4.52
   mu M for rGO/Au2O3 electrode within 1 h photothrombotic stroke, which
   was much higher than that (71.92 mu M +/- 2.52 mu M) for noncoated
   electrode via in vitro calibration. Simultaneously, the
   somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) test provided reliable and
   precise validation for detecting functional changes of neuronal
   activities. This newly developed implantable probe with localized
   rGO/Au2O3 nanocomposite electrode can serve as a rapid and reliable
   sensing platform for practical H2O2 detection in the brain or for other
   neural-chemical molecules in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Solving the problems of water pollution and water shortage is an urgent
   need for the sustainable development of modern society. Different
   approaches, including distillation, filtration, and photocatalytic
   degradation, have been developed for the purification of contaminated
   water and the generation of clean water. In this study, we explored a
   new approach that uses solar light for both water purification and clean
   water generation. A bifunctional membrane consisting of a top layer of
   TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), a middle layer of Au NPs, and a bottom layer
   of anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) was designed and fabricated through
   multiple filtration processes. Such a design enables both TiO2 NP-based
   photocatalytic function and Au NP-based solar-driven plasmonic
   evaporation. With the integration of these two functions into a single
   membrane, both the purification of contaminated water through
   photocatalytic degradation and the generation of clean water through
   evaporation were demonstrated using simulated solar illumination. Such a
   demonstration should also help open up a new strategy for maximizing
   solar energy conversion and utilization.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral self-assembled nanomaterials with biological applications have
   attracted great interest. In this study, DNA-driven gold-upconversion
   nanoparticle (Au-UCNP) pyramids were fabricated to detect intracellular
   microRNA (miRNA) in real time. The Au-UCNP pyramids are doubly optically
   active, displaying strong plasmonic circular dichroism (CD) at 521 nm
   and significant luminescence in 500-600 nm, and therefore can be
   monitored by both of them. CD will decrease while the luminescence
   intensity increases in the presence of miRNA. The experimental results
   show that the CD intensity had an outstanding linear range from 0.073 to
   43.65 fmol/10 mu g(RNA) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.03 fmol/10
   mu g(RNA), whereas the luminescence intensity ranged from 0.16 to 43.65
   fmol/10 mu g(RNA) with a LOD of 0.12 fmo1/10 mu g(RNA). These data
   indicate that the CD signal is much more sensitive to the concentration
   of miRNA than the luminescent signal, which is attributed to the strong
   CD intensity arising from the spin angular momentum of the photon
   interaction with chiral nanostructures and the plasmonic enhancement of
   the intrinsic chirality of DNA molecules in the pyramids. This approach
   opens up a new avenue to the ultrasensitive detection and quantification
   of miRNA in living cells.}},

Abstract = {{The oxide known as LLZO, with nominal composition Li7La3Zr2O12, is a
   promising solid electrolyte for Li-based batteries due to its high
   Li-ion conductivity and chemical stability with respect to lithium.
   Solid electrolytes may also enable the use of metallic Li anodes by
   serving as a physical barrier that suppresses dendrite initiation and
   propagation during cycling. Prior linear elasticity models of the Li
   electrode/solid electrolyte interface suggest that the stability of this
   interface is highly dependent on the elastic properties of the solid
   separator. For example, dendritic suppression is predicted to be
   enhanced as the electrolyte's shear modulus increases. In the present
   study a combination of first-principles calculations, acoustic impulse
   excitation measurements, and nanoindentation experiments are used to
   determine the elastic constants and moduli for high-conductivity LLZO
   compositions based on Al and Ta doping. The calculated and measured
   isotropic shear moduli are in good agreement and fall within the range
   of 56-61 GPa. These values are an order of magnitude larger than that
   for Li metal and far exceed the minimum value (similar to 8.5 GPa)
   believed to be necessary to suppress dendrite initiation. These data
   suggest that LLZO exhibits sufficient stiffness to warrant additional
   development as a solid electrolyte for Li batteries.}},

Abstract = {{We apply two different post-processing techniques to digital pulses
   induced by photons in a Nal(TI) detector and compare the obtained energy
   resolution to the standard analog approach. Our digital acquisition
   approach is performed using a single-stage acquisition with a fast
   digitizer. Both the postprocessing techniques we propose rely on signal
   integration. In the first, the pulse integral is calculated by directly
   numerically integrating the pulse digital samples, while in the second
   the pulse integral is estimated by a model-based fitting of the pulse.
   Our study used a 7.62 cm x 7.62 cm cylindrical Nal(TI) detector that
   gave a 7.60\% energy resolution (at 662 keV), using the standard analog
   acquisition approach, based on a pulse shaping amplifier. The new direct
   numerical integration yielded a 6.52\% energy resolution. The fitting
   approach yielded a 6.55\% energy resolution, and, although
   computationally heavier than numerical integration, is preferable when
   only the early samples of the pulse are available. We also evaluated the
   timing performance of a fast-slow detection system, encompassing an
   EJ-309 and a Nal(TI) scintillator. We use two techniques to determine
   the pulse start time: constant fraction discrimination (CFD) and
   adaptive noise threshold timing (ANT), for both the analog and digital
   acquisition approach. With the analog acquisition approach, we found a
   system time resolution of 5.8 ns and 7.3 ns, using the constant fraction
   discrimination and adaptive noise threshold timing, respectively. With
   the digital acquisition approach, a time resolution of 1.2 ns was
   achieved using the ANT method and 3.3 ns using CFD at 50\% of the
   maximum, to select the pulse start time. The proposed direct digital
   readout and post-processing techniques can improve the application of
   Nal(TI) detectors, traditionally considered `slow', for fast counting
   and correlation measurements, while maintaining a good measurement of
   the energy resolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   scintillators was developed in 2013; crystals up to diameters of 10 cm,
   or larger, have been grown while preserving excellent pulse shape
   discrimination (PSD) properties. The goal of this study is to evaluate
   the PSD capabilities of 5.08 by 5.08cm stilbene crystals grown by
   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Inrad Optics when exposed to
   a 1000 to 1 gamma ray-neutron ratio and operating at a 100-kHz count
   rate. Results were compared to an equivalent EJ-309 liquid scintillation
   detector. Cf-252 neutron pulses were recorded in two experiments where
   Co-60 and Cs-137 sources created the high-gamma field. The high count
   rate created numerous double pulses that were cleaned using fractional
   and template approaches designed to remove double pulses while
   preserving neutron counts. PSD was performed at a threshold of 42 keVee
   (440-keV proton) for stilbene and 60 keVee (610-keV proton) for EJ-309
   liquid. The lower threshold in stilbene resulted in a neutron intrinsic
   efficiency of approximately 14.5\%, 10\% higher than EJ-309 liquid, for
   bare Cf-252 and 13\% for Cf-252 in the high-gamma field. Despite the
   lower threshold, the gamma misclassification rate in stilbene was
   approximately 3 x 10(-6), nearly a factor-of-five lower than what we
   found with the EJ-309 liquid. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline fuel cells. Recent
   advances in the synthesis of metal nanoparticles have enabled the design
   of silver nanoparticles of different shapes, terminated with different
   surface facets that exhibit different catalytic properties. In this
   contribution, we prepared spherical and cubic silver nanoparticle
   electrocatalysts and tested their electrocatalytic oxygen reduction
   reaction activity in 0.1M sodium hydroxide. Our work demonstrates that
   carbon-supported silver nanospheres and nanocubes of similar size
   exhibit similar ORR activity with the spheres slightly outperforming the
   cubes. In addition, we suggest possible reasons for the slightly
   enhanced activity of the nanospheres.}},

Abstract = {{Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP or amylin) aggregation is
   directly associated with pancreatic p-cell death and subsequent insulin
   deficiency in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since no cure is currently
   available for T2D, it is of great benefit to devise new anti aggregation
   molecules, which protect beta-cells against hIAPP aggregation-induced
   toxicity. Engineered nanoparticles have been recently exploited as
   anti-aggregation nanomedicines. In this work, we studied graphene oxide
   (GO) nanosheets for their potential for hIAPP aggregation inhibition by
   combining computational modeling, biophysical characterization and cell
   toxicity measurements. Using discrete molecular dynamics (DMD)
   simulations and in vitro studies, we showed that GO exhibited an
   inhibitory effect on hIAPP aggregation. DMD simulations indicated that
   the strong binding of hIAPP to GO nanosheets was driven by hydrogen
   bonding and aromatic stacking and that the strong peptide-GO binding
   efficiently inhibited hIAPP self-association and aggregation on the
   nanosheet surface. Secondary structural changes of hIAPP upon GO binding
   derived from DMD simulations were consistent with circular dichroism
   (CD) spectroscopy measurements. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   images confirmed the reduction of hIAPP aggregation in the presence of
   GO. Furthermore, we carried out a cell toxicity assay and found that
   these nanosheets protected insulin-secreting NIT-1 pancreatic beta-cells
   against hIAPP-induced toxicity. Our multidisciplinary study suggests
   that GO nanosheets have the potential to be utilized as an
   anti-aggregation nanomedicine itself in addition to a biosensor or
   delivery vehicle for the mitigation of T2D progression.}},

Title = {{A female pelvic bone shape model for air/bone separation in support of

Abstract = {{Separating bone from air in MR data is one of the major challenges in
   using MR images to derive synthetic CT. The problem is further
   complicated when the anatomic regions filled with air are altered across
   scans due to air mobility, for instance, in pelvic regions, thereby the
   air regions estimated using an ultrashort echo time (UTE) sequence are
   invalid in other image series acquired for multispectral classification.
   This study aims to develop and investigate a female pelvic bone shape
   model to identify low intensity regions in MRI where air is unlikely to
   be present in support of synthetic CT generation without UTE imaging. CT
   scans of 30 patients were collected for the study, 17 of them also have
   corresponding MR scans. The shape model was built from the CT dataset,
   where the reference image was aligned to each of the training images
   using B-spline deformable registration. Principal component analysis was
   performed on B-spline coefficients for a compact model where shape
   variance was described by linear combination of principal modes. The
   model was applied to identify pelvic bone in MR images by deforming the
   corresponding MR data of the reference image to target MR images, where
   the search space of the deformation process was constrained within the
   subspace spanned by principal modes. The local minima in the search
   space were removed effectively by the shape model, thus supporting an
   efficient binary search for the optimal solution. We evaluated the model
   by its efficacy in identifying bone voxels and excluding air regions.
   The model was tested across the 17 patients that have corresponding MR
   scans using a leave-one-out cross validation. A simple model using the
   first leading principal mode only was found to achieve reasonable
   accuracy, where an averaged 87\% of bone voxels were correctly
   identified. Finally dilation of the optimally fit bone mask by 5 mm was
   found to cover 96\% of bone voxels while minimally impacting the overlap
   with air (below 0.4\%).}},

Abstract = {{High-density memristor-crossbar architecture is a very promising
   technology for future computing systems. The simplicity of the
   gateless-crossbar structure is both its principal advantage and the

   introduce new adaptive-threshold readout techniques that utilize the
   locality and hierarchy properties of the computer-memory system to
   address the sneak-paths problem. The proposed methods require a single

   Phenotypes Optimized for Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A
   Computational Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Lack of an effective vaccine results in 9 million new cases of
   tuberculosis (TB) every year and 1.8 million deaths worldwide. Although
   many infants are vaccinated at birth with BCG (an attenuated M. bovis),
   this does not prevent infection or development of TB after childhood.
   Immune responses necessary for prevention of infection or disease are
   still unknown, making development of effective vaccines against TB
   challenging. Several new vaccines are ready for human clinical trials,
   but these trials are difficult and expensive; especially challenging is
   determining the appropriate cellular response necessary for protection.
   The magnitude of an immune response is likely key to generating a
   successful vaccine. Characteristics such as numbers of central memory
   (CM) and effector memory (EM) T cells responsive to a diverse set of
   epitopes are also correlated with protection. Promising vaccines against
   TB contain mycobacterial subunit antigens (Ag) present during both
   active and latent infection. We hypothesize that protection against
   different key immunodominant antigens could require a vaccine that
   produces different levels of EM and CM for each Ag-specific memory
   population. We created a computational model to explore EM and GM
   values, and their ratio, within what we term Memory Design Space. Our
   model captures events involved in T cell priming within lymph nodes and
   tracks their circulation through blood to peripheral tissues. We used
   the model to test whether multiple Ag-specific memory cell populations
   could be generated with distinct locations within Memory Design Space at
   a specific time point post vaccination. Boosting can further shift
   memory populations to memory cell ratios unreachable by initial priming
   events. By strategically varying antigen load, properties of cellular
   interactions within the LN, and delivery parameters (e.g., number of
   boosts) of multi-subunit vaccines, we can generate multiple Ag-specific
   memory populations that cover a wide range of Memory Design Space. Given
   a set of desired characteristics for Ag-specific memory populations, we
   can use our model as a tool to predict vaccine formulations that will
   generate those populations.}},

Abstract = {{Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a model organism for
   understanding aging and studying animal behavior. Microfluidic assay
   techniques have brought widespread advances in C. elegans research;
   however, traditional microfluidic assays such as those based on soft
   lithography require time-consuming design and fabrication cycles and
   offer limited flexibility in changing the geometric environment during
   experimentation. We present a technique for maskless photopatterning of
   a biocompatible hydrogel on an NGM (Agar) substrate, enabling dynamic
   manipulation of the C. elegans culture environment in vitro. Maskless
   photopatterning is performed using a projector-based microscope system
   largely built from off-the-shelf components. We demonstrate the
   capabilities of this technique by building micropillar arrays during C.
   elegans observation, by fabricating free-floating mechanisms that can be
   actuated by C. elegans motion, by using freehand drawing to isolate
   individual C. elegans in real time, and by patterning arrays of mazes
   for isolation and fitness testing of C. elegans populations. In vitro
   photopatterning enables rapid and flexible design of experiment geometry
   as well as real-time interaction between the researcher and the assay
   such as by sequential isolation of individual organisms. Future adoption
   of image analysis and machine learning techniques could be used to
   acquire large datasets and automatically adapt the assay geometry.}},

Abstract = {{This article summarizes the contributions in research on tissue cutting
   with needles. The geometry of the needle's cutting edges was
   analytically defined and expressions for the inclination and rake angles
   of hollow and solid needles and trocars have been derived. Based on the
   semi-empirical method, finite element model and the fracture mechanics
   approach, force models of needle insertion were developed. The
   relationship between the needle's tip geometry and insertion force was
   established and used in several applications. It was shown, for example,
   that the cutting edge of the lancet needle can be optimally designed to
   minimize insertion force or bevel length. The cutting mechanics in
   rotary needle insertion was investigated along with the exploration of
   improvements of needle biopsy performance by decreasing the needle
   cutting and friction forces. The deflections of the needle during
   insertion were measured to develop a strategy for guiding the needle to
   the right position in brachytherapy and drug delivery. From an overall
   perspective, fundamental advances and application problems based on the
   cutting mechanics of soft tissue for needle were highlighted to lay the
   foundation for developments of biomedical device and improvements of

Abstract = {{Graphite as the most common polymorph of naturally occurring crystalline
   carbon is required for many different applications such as batteries,
   refractories, electrical products, and pencils. Graphite resources are
   currently being subjected to intensive exploration to help meet rapidly
   growing global demand - and graphite has made it onto the list of
   critical raw materials as issued by the European Union. Graphite ore is
   mostly beneficiated using flotation separation techniques. The
   increasing demand for high-grade graphite products with up to 99.99\%
   carbon has resulted in the development of various approaches to remove
   impurities even to parts per million range. This paper considers
   separation and purification techniques that are currently employed for
   graphite mineral beneficiation, and identifies areas in need of further
   research.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter we present a review of plasma transport in the
   magnetospheres of the rapidly rotating outer planets Jupiter and Saturn
   with emphasis on the effects of magnetic reconnection. Unlike the
   Earth's magnetosphere where reconnection is the dominant transport
   mechanism, atmospherically driven corotation dominates at Jupiter and
   Saturn. However, there is both observational and theoretical basis for
   reconnection at the outer planets. Since observations at the outer
   planets are sparse we have used numerical simulations to give an overall
   view of transport. For northward IMF, reconnection can erode the dayside
   Jovian magnetopause position by as much as 10 \% while the simulations
   at Saturn indicate very little erosion. In the magnetotail, reconnection
   at Jupiter can become quasi-periodic in both Jupiter and Saturn
   simulations. There is observational evidence for this at Jupiter but the
   observational evidence is not as clear at Saturn. Solar wind dynamic
   pressure controls whether or not periodic reconnection occurs at Saturn
   while both dynamic pressure and the IMF are important at Jupiter. Both
   outflowdriven reconnection in which flux tubes reconnect as they convect
   from the dayside to the tail and solar-wind-driven reconnection are
   found in the simulations. One simulation study indicates that a pulse of
   increased dynamic pressure can trigger reconnection at Saturn. Large
   scale plasmoids do not remove enough plasma from the magnetospheres of
   either outer planet to account for loss of plasma from the inner
   magnetosphere sources. There is evidence in the Saturn simulations of
   Kelvin-Helmholtz waves driving transport.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with bipolar disorder typically exhibit changes in the
   acoustics of their speech. Mobile health systems seek to model these
   changes to automatically detect and correctly identify current states in
   an individual and to ultimately predict impending mood episodes. We have
   developed a program, PRIORI (Predicting Individual Outcomes for Rapid
   Intervention), that analyzes acoustics of speech as predictors of mood
   states from mobile smartphone data. Mood prediction systems generally
   assume that the symptomatology of an individual can be modeled using
   patterns common in a cohort population due to limitations in the size of
   available datasets. However, individuals are unique. This paper explores
   person-level systems that can be developed from the current PRIORI
   database of an extensive and longitudinal collection composed of two
   subsets: a smaller labeled portion and a larger unlabeled portion. The
   person-level system employs the unlabeled portion to extract i-vectors,
   which characterize single individuals. The labeled portion is then used
   to train person-level and population-level supervised classifiers,
   operating on the i-vectors and on speech rhythm statistics,
   respectively. The unification of these two approaches results in a
   significant improvement over the baseline system, demonstrating the
   importance of a multi-level approach to capturing depression
   symptomatology.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic recognition of aphasic speech is challenging due to various
   speech-language impairments associated with aphasia as well as a
   scarcity of training data appropriate for this speaker population.
   AphasiaBank, a shared database of multimedia interactions primarily used
   by clinicians to study aphasia, offers a promising source of data for
   Deep Neural Network acoustic modeling. In this paper, we establish the
   first large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition baseline on
   AphasiaBank and study recognition accuracy as a function of diagnoses.
   We investigate several out-of-domain adaptation methods and show that
   AphasiaBank data can be leveraged to significantly improve the
   recognition rate on a smaller aphasic speech corpus. This work helps
   broaden the understanding of aphasic speech recognition, demonstrates
   the potential of AphasiaBank, and guides researchers who wish to use
   this database for their own work.}},

Abstract = {{Currently available vaccine adjuvants are ineffective against a wide
   range of infectious pathogens as well as cancers. Therefore, there is a
   critical demand for new vaccine strategies that can elicit potent
   cellular and humoral immune responses. Liposomes have been widely
   examined as vaccine delivery systems because of their safety, low
   toxicity, and ease of scale-up. However, successful clinical translation
   of liposomal vaccines has been hampered by their limited potency to
   induce strong T and B cell responses. In this chapter, we will present
   two classes of lipid-based nanoparticle systems designed to address
   limitations of liposomal vaccines and discuss their potential as vaccine
   delivery systems. The first class of lipid-based nanoparticles presented
   in this chapter is termed interbilayer-crosslinked multilamellar
   vesicles. These novel vaccine nanoparticles are stable vehicles that can
   effectively deliver antigens and adjuvant molecules to
   antigen-presenting cells in lymphoid tissues and induce robust T and B
   cell immune responses in vivo. The second class of vaccine nanoparticles
   is lipoproteins composed of endogenous proteins and lipids. Applications
   of lipoproteins for vaccine delivery have recently gained much attention
   due to their safety and multi-faceted functions as endogenous drug
   delivery vehicles. We provide an overview on the latest advances in this
   rapidly evolving interdisciplinary area of research, and we discuss
   biomaterial-based innovations enabled by nanotechnology for improving
   vaccine design and development.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, sparse representation (SR) over a redundant dictionary has
   become a popular way of representing the data. It has been verified as
   an efficient and useful tool to promote the discrimination between
   signals. This work develops a joint learning approach to find the low
   dimensional discriminative features for high dimensional data. To avoid
   the high computational cost of direct sparse coding on large scale input
   data, we first learn SR in an orthogonal projected space over a
   task-driven sparsifying dictionary. We then exploit the discriminative
   projection on SR. The whole learning process is treated as an
   optimization problem of trace quotient maximization, which involves an
   orthogonal projection on original data space, a dictionary and a
   discriminative projection on sparse codes. The related cost function is
   well defined on a product manifold of the Stiefel manifold, the Oblique
   manifold and the Grassmann manifold. Finally, we employ a stochastic
   gradient descent algorithm on the smooth product manifold to maximize
   the cost function. Our numerical experiments on visual recognition
   demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm, in comparison with
   the state of the arts.}},

Abstract = {{We describe recent experience and results from implementing a fission
   matrix capability into the MCNP Monte Carlo code. The fission matrix can
   be used to provide estimates of the fundamental mode fission
   distribution, the dominance ratio, the eigenvalue spectrum, and higher
   mode forward and adjoint eigenfunctions of the fission neutron source
   distribution. It can also be used to accelerate the convergence of the
   power method iterations and to provide basis functions for higher-order
   perturbation theory. The higher-mode fission sources can be used in MCNP
   to determine higher-mode forward fluxes and tallies, and work is
   underway to provide higher-mode adjoint-weighted fluxes and tallies.
   Past difficulties and limitations of the fission matrix approach are
   overcome with a new sparse representation of the matrix, permitting much
   larger and more accurate fission matrix representations. The new fission
   matrix capabilities provide a significant advance in the
   state-of-the-art for Monte Carlo criticality calculations.}},

Abstract = {{The NEA Monte Carlo Performance benchmark started in 2011 aiming to
   monitor over the years the abilities to perform a full-size Monte Carlo
   reactor core calculation with a detailed power production for each fuel
   pin with axial distribution. This paper gives an overview of the
   contributed results thus far. It shows that reaching a statistical
   accuracy of 1 \% for most of the small fuel zones requires about 100
   billion neutron histories. The efficiency of parallel execution of Monte
   Carlo codes on a large number of processor cores shows clear limitations
   for computer clusters with common type computer nodes. However, using
   true supercomputers the speedup of parallel calculations is increasing
   up to large numbers of processor cores. More experience is needed from
   calculations on true supercomputers using large numbers of processors in
   order to predict if the requested calculations can be done in a short
   time.
   As the specifications of the reactor geometry for this benchmark test
   are well suited for further investigations of full-core Monte Carlo
   calculations and a need is felt for testing other issues than its
   computational performance, proposals are presented for extending the
   benchmark to a suite of benchmark problems for evaluating fission source
   convergence for a system with a high dominance ratio, for coupling with
   thermal-hydraulics calculations to evaluate the use of different
   temperatures and coolant densities and to study the correctness and
   effectiveness of burnup calculations. Moreover, other contemporary
   proposals for a full-core calculation with realistic geometry and
   material composition will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Narrow-band transmission filters composed of asymmetric high contrast
   dielectric gratings are simulated in the long-wavelength infrared region
   (8-12 mu m). The subwavelength gratings are designed to provide a
   high-reflectivity background, while the asymmetric geometry provides
   narrowband transmission that is accessible at normal incidence. Finite
   element modeling of these structures demonstrate that narrowband
   response may be tuned across the long-wavelength infrared spectral
   region by varying grating geometry. Among the asymmetric geometries, a
   two-step grating structure appears to be a promising candidate to enable
   normal incidence filtering with reasonable fabrication procedures.
   Progress on experimental methods of fabricating the asymmetric
   geometries will be presented at the conference.}},

Abstract = {{Smartphone apps are becoming a popular vehicle to collect users'
   personal interests, demographics and other private information. Due to
   lack of regulation, a curious party can covertly link and aggregate
   sensitive information from independent sources (sessions or apps) over
   time to conduct unwanted user profiling, targeted advertising or
   surveillance. Such unregulated aggregation is rooted at the
   non-existence of unlinkability in the mobile ecosystem. On one hand, the
   mobile ecosystem is over-populated with various persistent identifiers
   and fueled by the abundance of user information; on the other hand,
   users only expect app usages that are functionally-dependent to be
   linkable. To bridge this gap, we propose a practical solution, called
   Mask, that allows users to negotiate to what extent his behavior can be
   linked and aggregated. Specifically, Mask introduces a set of private
   execution modes which enable different levels of unlinkability. Mask is
   a user-level solution and does not require any change in the existing
   ecosystem, thus allowing for easy deployment. We present the technical
   details and challenges of our user-level implementation and evaluate its
   runtime performance as well as applicability.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of latency arbitrage on allocative efficiency and
   liquidity in fragmented financial markets. We employ a simple model of
   latency arbitrage in which a single security is traded on two exchanges,
   with price quotes available to regular traders only after some delay. An
   infinitely fast arbitrageur reaps profits when the two markets diverge
   due to this latency in cross-market communication. Using an agent-based
   approach, we simulate interactions between high-frequency and
   zero-intelligence trading agents. From simulation data over a large
   space of strategy combinations, we estimate game models and compute
   strategic equilibria in a variety of market environments. We then
   evaluate allocative efficiency and market liquidity in equilibrium, and
   we find that market fragmentation and the presence of a latency
   arbitrageur reduces total surplus and negatively impacts liquidity. By
   replacing continuous-time markets with periodic call markets, we
   eliminate latency arbitrage opportunities and achieve further efficiency
   gains through the aggregation of orders over short time periods.}},

Abstract = {{Belief propagation (BP) is a high-throughput decoding algorithm for
   polar codes, but it is known to underperform successive cancellation

   uncover the error mechanisms, as well as the influence of channel
   condition, code design, and decoder implementation. Based on the
   insights, we design new ways to detect, prevent and overcome BP decoding
   errors.}},

   (PL). Measured data show that the QDs synthesized in our laboratory have
   a thermal-PL sensitivity of 0.16nm/ degrees C . An uptake of QDs into
   living cells is made accomplished by the liposome transfection method.
   The intracellular temperature measuring capabilities of the system is
   demonstrated by the use of ionomycin calcium ions as a cellular
   thermogenesis accelerator to autonomously induce temperature changes in
   living cells. By adjusting the optical components in the measurement
   system, the QDs can be located and their PL emission variation as a

Abstract = {{Computational electromagnetics modeling is presented for the design of
   multilayered nanoparticles for maximized forward light scattering. The
   design computation makes use of a recursive solution algorithm for
   multiscattering of light waves by multilayered core-shell nanoparticle
   aggregates. The algorithm is based on the analytical solution of Maxwell
   equations using the multipole-expansion method coupled with the
   translational addition and the Wigner-Eckart quantum projection
   theorems. Calculations are carried out to design the core-shell
   structured nanoparticles for maximized forward scattering. The
   nanostructured particles so designed are further tested by FDTD
   simulations for light scattering into a flat Si substrate. Computed data
   show that the designed multilayered particles with maximized forward
   scattering allows more incident light to be absorbed in the substrate
   than other good light scatters.}},

Abstract = {{Sharing of security information among organizations has often been
   proposed as a method for improving the state of cyber-security for all.
   However, such disclosure entails costs for the reporting entity,
   including a drop in market value, loss of customer confidence, and
   bureaucratic burdens. By adopting a game-theoretic approach for
   understanding firms' incentives, we first show that in one shot
   interactions, disclosure costs act as disincentives for sharing, leading
   to no information sharing at equilibrium. We then consider a repeated
   game formulation that enables the use of inter-temporal incentives
   (i.e., the conditioning of future decisions on the history of past
   interactions) to support firms' cooperation on information sharing. We
   show that the nature of the monitoring available to firms greatly
   affects the possibility of sustaining nearly efficient outcomes through
   repeated interactions. Specifically, we first illustrate the limitations
   arising when firms' have independent and imperfect private monitoring
   technologies. We then consider the role of a public
   monitoring/assessment system, and show that despite using the same
   imperfect technology as the individual firms, the monitor can facilitate
   cooperation among participants. Our results therefore illustrate the
   impact of a public rating/reputation system on the viability of security
   information sharing agreements.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, dynamic resource allocation and multicast routing
   algorithms are proposed for elastic optical networks (EONs). The
   proposed algorithms find the shortest path trees by modeling either the
   amount of free spectrum in each link or the link length as the cost
   function of routing method. The proposed algorithms are simulated in the
   dynamic operation scenario over the so called US Backbone topology.
   Simulation results reveal that by considering the cost function of
   routing algorithm based on the available spectrum in each link will
   improve the blocking probability while reduce the spectrum efficiency.
   On the other hand, by considering link length as the cost function, the
   blocking probability get worsen whereas the bandwidth efficiency is
   improved. Consequently, in order to compromise the benefits of both
   algorithms, we consider a mixed cost function based on the normalized
   cost function of each method and employing a weighting coefficient to
   trad-off between blocking probability and spectrum efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to accurately stratify patients at risk of adverse
   cardiovascular outcomes using heart sound recordings could result in
   earlier treatment and improved patient outcomes. However, there remain
   several challenges associated with risk stratifying patients based on
   the phonocardiogram (PCG) alone. First, inter-patient differences can
   make it challenging to learn a model that generalizes well across
   patients. Second, heterogeneity introduced by the collection environment
   of the recordings can render a classifier trained on one population
   useless when applied to another. To address these challenges we explore
   the use of temporal alignment techniques, in particular dynamic time
   warping (DTW). Using DTW we compare heart sounds within and across
   subjects/recordings. These DTW based features, coupled with widely used
   spectral MFCC coefficients, serve as input to a linear SVM. Applied to
   the held-out test set our classifier obtained a test score of 82.4\%,
   suggesting that temporal alignment techniques can effectively reduce the
   effects of inter-patient variability and mitigate the differences
   introduced by heterogeneous data collection environments.}},

Abstract = {{We query 172 students in a team-taught 3rd year ME laboratory course
   about chatroom use including:
   Concerns of privacy in a competitive classroom
   Intimidation of speaking in a large lecture room
   Fairness of equal access to information -Faster response time{''}
   Responses from more than one lecturer (and peers)
   Awkwardness of visual information (equations and graphs)
   Up-to-date information on lab equipment malfunctions and concerns
   Permanence of information
   The author has taught Laboratory courses for well over a decade with
   increasing usage of information technology, especially use of chat (here
   considered only in text form). He has converted fellow instructors to
   greater chat room use. The following is a discussion in recent years
   with a similar class:
   I much prefer the chat room over emails in answering questions. I also
   prefer questions during lectures (especially during Q\& A) over private
   discussions after lectures and using emails. Hence, I was disappointed
   that I pleaded for more questions during lecture, dismissed class early,
   and then got many groups coming up and asking questions!
   Allow me to question the need to ask questions more privately. I present
   several possible scenarios:
   1 I'm asking a question that only my group would be interested in having
   the answer.
   2 I'm worried that I'm asking a really dumb question. I'm shy.
   3 I don't even know what question to ask!
   4 I'm asking a personal question such as, `` What should I do when a
   team member is disengaged?{''}
   5 You are worried that you are questioning an `` authority figure{''}.
   6 You are mainly looking for assurance in your data, conclusions, etc.
   7 I'm asking a question every group should be interested in, but perhaps
   I was the only one smart enough to ask, and I want to receive the ``
   inside information{''}. A very competitive job market invites GPA
   comparison with peers at UM and more specifically in ME495.
   Now allow me to analyze these in order:
   1 Haven't encountered any of these yet-at least this semester.
   2 Of course, the standard answer to this concern is, ``There are no dumb
   questions.{''} In reality, some questions are less dumb than others! I
   think I haven't heard nor read any questions that were not appropriately
   addressed to the general community. Sometimes, the question may have
   been addressed in lecture or the chat room previously, but we all need
   reminders!
   3 When the conversation starts with, `` I don't even know how to
   start..{''} it's hard to deal with that in a public way. In general,
   asking a question publicly forces one to word it more carefully. The
   answers might be more careful as well.
   4 Please don't ask these questions publicly! Start with your GSI and
   contact the rest of your ME495 teaching team as appropriate. Haven't had
   any yet.
   5 In many cultures, asking any question of an instructor is a sign of
   disrespect. Either the instructor must be wrong or did not explain the
   answer well the first time.
   6 This happens fairly frequently. Try to avoid it when possible. It
   seems a little bit too much like, ``Will you grade my report before I
   submit it?{''} It may just broadcast your insecurity. Think of a way to
   pose the question in a way that isn't just seeking a pat on the back.
   7 You are learning much from your peers, even as you may be competing
   with them. One of the best ways to find out what they are thinking about
   is by seeing what questions they are asking.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the extended logarithmic smoothing technique is
   integrated into the indirect optimal control formulation to numerically
   generate minimum-fuel low-thrust trajectories. This approach is
   considered for three cases in which equations of motion are specified in
   terms of Cartesian coordinates, spherical coordinates and modified
   equinoctial orbital elements. It is shown that by combining logarithmic
   smoothing with formulating equations of motion in an appropriate
   coordinate system, which can be problem dependent, the optimal control
   problem is more amenable to numerical treatment after a fewer number of
   iterations even if a single shooting technique is applied with a poor
   initial guess. In addition, the paper addresses the calculation of the
   Jacobian matrix of the constraints via an implementation of the State
   Transition Matrix approach which avoids the discontinuities of the
   control along the trajectory. The results of applying this technique to
   two interplanetary rendezvous missions from Earth to Mars and Earth to
   asteroid Dionysus are reported and compared in terms of the number of
   iterations, accuracy in satisfying the constraints, and computational
   time. We demonstrate that bang-off-bang type solutions can be generated
   efficiently using general purpose solvers that benefit from accurate
   sensitivity information and provide a distinct advantage.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed Denial of Service attacks against high-profile targets have
   become more frequent in recent years. In response to such massive
   attacks, several architectures have adopted proxies to introduce layers
   of indirection between end users and target services and reduce the
   impact of a DDoS attack by migrating users to new proxies and shuffling
   clients across proxies so as to isolate malicious clients. However, the
   reactive nature of these solutions presents weaknesses that we leveraged
   to develop a new attack - the proxy harvesting attack - which enables
   malicious clients to collect information about a large number of proxies
   before launching a DDoS attack. We show that current solutions are
   vulnerable to this attack, and propose a moving target defense technique
   consisting in periodically and proactively replacing one or more proxies
   and remapping clients to proxies. Our primary goal is to disrupt the
   attacker's reconnaissance effort. Additionally, to mitigate ongoing
   attacks, we propose a new client-to-proxy assignment strategy to isolate
   compromised clients, thereby reducing the impact of attacks. We validate
   our approach both theoretically and through simulation, and show that
   the proposed solution can effectively limit the number of proxies an
   attacker can discover and isolate malicious clients.}},

Abstract = {{Perceiving object poses in a cluttered scene is a challenging problem
   because of the partial observations available to an embodied robot,
   where cluttered scenes are especially problematic. In addition to
   occlusions, cluttered scenes have various cases of uncertainty due to
   physical object interactions, such as touching, stacking and partial
   support. In this paper, we discuss these cases of physics-based
   uncertainty one by one and propose methods for physically-viable scene
   estimation. Specifically, we use Newtonian physical simulation to
   validate the plausibility of hypotheses within a generative
   probabilistic inference framework for: particle filtering, MCMC and an
   MCMC variant on particle filtering. Assuming that object geometries are
   known, we estimate the scene as a collection of object poses, and infer
   a distribution over the state space of scenes as well as the maximum
   likelihood estimate. We compare with ICP based approaches and present
   our results for scene estimation in isolated cases of physical object
   interaction as well as multi-object scenes such that manipulation of
   graspable objects can be performed with a PR2 robot.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the early spatial learning of human infants, we describe
   progress toward enabling a robotic learning agent to learn the structure
   of peri-personal space - the space immediately around the agent within
   which reaching and grasping take place - with minimal prior spatial
   knowledge.
   We propose the PPS Graph representation for early knowledge of
   peri-personal space, a model that produces behaviors qualitatively
   consistent with early human motion, and that may provide information on
   how humans learn manipulation skills through its implementation in a
   computational system. Each graph node represents a visual sense vector
   and a proprioceptive sense vector corresponding to the same state of the
   world, but neither sense vector has a pre-existing interpretation in
   terms of a 3D model of the environment. An edge linking two nodes in the
   PPS Graph represents the feasibility of motion between those two states.
   Learning starts with ``motor babbling{''}, random exploration of the
   space of joint angle vectors, leading to the creation of an initial PPS
   graph representing arm configurations in an otherwise empty space. The
   next crucial step is recognizing an unusual event, such as accidentally
   colliding with an object and changing its position. Once a type of
   unusual event has been identified, the goal for learning is to identify
   the prerequisites for an action to achieve an event of that type.
   We report the results of experiments on a physical Baxter robot, both on
   a small Learning Graph and on a much larger Sampled PPS Graph to
   demonstrate scalability. We show how appropriate features can be
   extracted from uninterpreted visual images, and that combining weakly
   informative features with Naive Bayes allows our robot to plan and make
   reliable reaching motions. We hypothesize that a similar approach will
   extend these results to grasping and moving objects.}},

Abstract = {{We focus on designing efficient integrated schedulers for handling mixed
   unicast and multicast traffic. We consider an input-queued switch with a
   multicast-capable switch fabric. At each input port of the switch, there
   are N dedicated unicast VOQs and one shared multicast queue (MQ). An
   existing approach to the design of integrated scheduler (i.e., a
   sequential scheduler) is to run two component schedulers, one for
   multicast and one for unicast, sequentially in each time slot. To
   minimize the head-of-line blocking of multicast traffic, the multicast
   scheduler always runs first. But sequentially running two schedulers in
   each time slot is challenging, especially when the slot duration is
   small. In this paper, we first propose a pipelined integration of the
   two component schedulers (i.e., a pipelined scheduler), which allows
   twice the amount of time for each scheduler to execute. We then extend
   an existing single-bit-single-iteration unicast scheduler to ensure that
   even in the presence of multicast traffic, unicast traffic will be
   starvation-free. This is achieved by giving unicast traffic priority
   over multicast periodically. Finally, we present arguably the first
   single-bit-single-iteration multicast scheduling algorithm. Extensive
   simulation results show that our pipelined scheduler is efficient and
   provides delay-throughput performance comparable to the sequential
   scheduler.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel unipolar SPWM-oriented modulation for the
   isolated bi-directional DC-to-three-phase-AC converter with
   high-frequency-link (HFL) using SiC MOSFETs. The converter consists of a
   full bridge (FB) stage and a single-to-three-phase matrix converter with
   high frequency transformer isolation. Under the proposed modulation,
   zero voltage switching (ZVS) is realized for the full bridge and zero
   voltage zero current switching (ZVZCS) is realized for the switches
   operating in the selected modes in the matrix converter for all load
   range. Synchronous Rectification (SR) is implemented for switches
   operating in the complimentary and synchronous modes. The proposed
   modulation technique takes advantages of the manifest merits of SiC
   devices such as the low turn-on resistance and ultra-fast reverse
   recovery characteristic. Moreover, the voltage spike induced by the
   transformer leakage inductance is mitigated with the proposed modulation
   technique without additional snubber circuits or components. The
   simulation results provided well validate the functionality and
   effectiveness of soft-switching of the proposed modulation. For the
   experimental results, the proposed modulation with SiC devices is
   implemented to improve the efficiency from 88.0\% to 94.1\% at 1.3kW
   compared to traditional modulation in matrix converter.}},

Abstract = {{Time series data are ubiquitous and are of importance in many
   application problems in engineering, science, medicine, economics and
   entertainment. Many real world pattern classification problems involve
   the processing and analysis of multiple variables in the temporal
   domain. These types of problems are referred to as Multivariate Time
   Series (MTS) problems. In many real-world applications, an MTS problem
   can involve a large number of signals, and require algorithms to select
   signals and extract temporal and spatial features from them. In this
   paper, we present an innovative convolutional neural network,
   MTS-DeepNet that is specially designed for MTS pattern classification.
   The system integrates signal and feature selections with MTS pattern
   classification in one learning framework. MTS-DeepNet is applied to a
   real-world problem, namely predicting driver lane departure based on
   driver's physiological signals. Our experimental results showed that, in
   comparison to a multi-layer neural network trained with the
   backpropagation algorithm, MTS-DeepNet gave better prediction accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{survival analysis, the primary goal is to monitor several entities and
   model the occurrence of a particular event of interest. In such
   applications, it is quite often the case that the event of interest may
   not always be observed during the study period and this gives rise to
   the problem of censoring which cannot be easily handled in the standard
   regression approaches. In addition, obtaining sufficient labeled
   training instances for learning a robust prediction model is a very time
   consuming process and can be extremely difficult in practice. In this
   paper, we propose a transfer learning based Cox method, called
   Transfer-Cox, which uses auxiliary data to augment learning when there
   are insufficient amount of training examples. The proposed method aims
   to extract ``useful{''} knowledge from the source domain and transfer it
   to the target domain, thus potentially improving the prediction
   performance in such timeto-event data. The proposed method uses the
   l(2,1)-normpenalty to encourage multiple predictors to share similar
   sparsity patterns, thus learns a shared representation across source and
   target domains, potentially improving the model performance on the
   target task. To speedup the computation, we apply the screening approach
   and extend the strong rule to sparse survival analysis models in
   multiple high-dimensional censored datasets. We demonstrate the
   performance of the proposed transfer learning method using several
   synthetic and high-dimensional microarray gene expression benchmark
   datasets and compare with other related competing state-of-the-art
   methods. Our results show that the proposed screening approach
   significantly improves the computational efficiency of the proposed
   algorithm without compromising the prediction performance. We also
   demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach and show that the
   time taken to obtain the results is linear with respect to both the
   number of instances and features.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on an optical visual fiducial system developed for
   relative-pose estimation of two ships at sea. Visual fiducials are
   ubiquitous in the robotics literature, however none are specifically
   designed for use in outdoor lighting conditions. Blooming of the CCD
   causes a significant bias in the estimated pose of square tags that use
   the outer corners as point correspondences. In this paper, we augment
   existing state-of-the-art visual fiducials with a border of circles that
   enables high accuracy, robust pose estimation. We also present a
   methodology for characterizing tag measurement uncertainty on a per
   measurement basis. We integrate these methods into a relative ship
   motion estimation system and support our results using outdoor imagery
   and field data collected aboard the USNS John Glenn and USNS Bob Hope
   during skin-to-skin operations.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been growing interest in the design of
   intelligent transportation systems (ITS) using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
   and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication technologies. These
   systems allow vehicles to share GPS-based information, such as latitude,
   longitude, speed and heading, as well as important vehicle data such as
   brake events, throttle position, turn signal status, etc. A pre-crash
   detection and warning system in a host vehicle (i.e. vehicle of
   interest) needs to accurately determine not only the position of each
   remote vehicle in its vicinity, but also the context of the driving
   environment because the context can provide important information about
   whether or not the remote vehicle poses a threat to the host. For
   example, remote vehicles in the same lane or one lane over typically
   pose more of a threat than remote vehicles two or more lanes over. In
   this paper, we propose a real-time algorithm that computes the relative
   position and driving context of all remote vehicles within a region of
   interest of the host vehicle. Experimental results on real-world V2V
   data show that the proposed method can effectively compute the position
   and context of remote vehicles in real time.}},

Abstract = {{Many real-time vision applications require accurate estimation of
   optical flow. This problem is quite challenging due to extremely high
   computation and memory bandwidth requirements. This paper presents a
   parallel block-based optical flow algorithm along with an optimized
   multicore hardware architecture. The algorithm is based on
   neighbor-guided semi-global matching (NG-fSGM), a dynamic programming
   algorithm that aggressively prunes search space using flow vector
   information of the neighboring pixels. In the block based NG-fSGM, the
   image is divided into overlapping blocks and the blocks are processed in
   parallel for high throughput. While large overlap between blocks
   improves the accuracy, it results in larger memory and higher
   computational complexity. To minimize the amount of overlap among blocks
   with minimal effect on the accuracy, we use temporal prediction to guide
   flow vectors along the block boundaries. A pseudo-random flow candidate
   selection technique is also introduced to reduce memory access bandwidth
   and computation requirements. The proposed algorithm is mapped onto a
   multicore architecture where each core has a high degree of internal
   parallelism and implements a prefetching technique to improve throughput
   and reduce memory latency. The proposed hardware-efficient algorithm and
   the corresponding architecture achieve significant gains in throughput,
   latency, and power efficiency with only 1.25\% accuracy degradation
   compared to the original NG-fSGM when evaluated on the Middlebury
   dataset.}},

   shown that Bessel beams can be generated at microwave and millimeter
   wave frequencies using a planar, leaky-wave antenna. In this work, a
   system comprised of two coupled Bessel beam launchers is presented. By
   employing a mode-matching technique, a complete solution of the system
   and its supported modes is obtained. Power transfer between the two
   launchers under a complex-conjugate impedance match is reported.
   Additionally, even and odd mode-splitting is discussed in terms of power
   transfer efficiency. An analysis of the coupled system's even and odd
   modes of operation show that efficient power transfer is possible. The
   odd mode is shown to yield higher field confinement and power transfer
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents improvements upon a previous paper detailing an
   Android mobile phone application demonstrating methods for implementing
   or assisting traditional speech therapy techniques using mobile devices.
   {[}1] After development, the software was implemented on a Galaxy Tab,
   an Android tablet that, at approximately \$100 per tab let, is quite
   affordable. The techniques are principally aimed at treating
   Parkinsons-disease induced hypophonia and habit-induced hyperphonia, but
   are applicable to other speech or language disorders, particularly vocal
   projection issues.
   This paper will present practical obstacles in developing the
   application and their solutions, feedback from medical testing, and
   practical improvements to the device setup itself. In particular, it
   focuses on improvements to the device's user interface, physical noise
   reduction in mobile devices, and the implementation and
   altered-audio-feedback on an Android device. It was found that using a
   single type of device with pre-set parameters tor certain tasks was more
   effective than allowing medical technicians, who may be unfamiliar with
   the technology, to calibrate the software to different types of devices.
   Additionally, the use of throat microphones will be tested to reduce
   noise and enable more effective treatment.}},

Abstract = {{In the motor behavior literature, the observation that humans can learn
   and adapt to altered limb dynamics is often explained with reference to
   internal models. Forward internal models enable robust performance even
   when feedback is intermittent or delayed while inverse models simplify
   the loop dynamics to manageable form. Internal models of coupled
   limb/object dynamics, however, do not address the skill with which
   humans track references or reject disturbances that can be recognized
   and anticipated. We propose that internal models of reference or
   disturbance signals create a useful framework for addressing open
   questions in human motor behavior. We appeal to the Internal Model
   Principle in control theory, which suggests that a model of the
   predictable signal (a signal generator) belongs in the controller. When
   the control loop is already stable, such an internal model will produce
   perfect tracking or disturbance rejection in steady state. In this paper
   we apply the Internal Model Principle to hypothesize controllers that
   elicit cyclic behaviors from systems that feature elastic and inertial
   energy storage. We also outfit this model with features that describe
   human neuromuscular dynamics and thereby enable the description of two
   roles for force feedback: carrying power that couples the human/machine
   dynamics and carrying information for neural control processing. (C)

Abstract = {{The allocation of authority between a human driver and an automation
   system designed to share control with the driver must be managed
   carefully to ensure safety and driver satisfaction. A driver can tighten
   grip on a steering; wheel, co-contract arm muscles, grid change posture
   to increase authority relative to an automation system that has a finite
   mechanical impedance. In this paper we develop a system model outfitted
   with the features required to describe modulating impedance as a means
   to dynamically allocate authority. We adopt a standard modeling
   framework, but focus on the description of the driving point impedance
   of both the driver and the automation system. Haptic feedback from the
   steering wheel functions both to cue the driver but, also to couple the
   driver biomechanics to the steering and automation system. We also
   describe a platform designed to support experiments ill control sharing
   with dynamic allocation of authority between two humans, one of them
   acting as a stand-in for the automation system. (C) 2016, IFAC

Abstract = {{Modeling mobile robot driving performance is a challenging task, but a
   simple, accurate model can be helpful in making robot system design
   decisions that balance cost and performance. Driving performance can
   depend on a variety of factors including human ability, capabilities of
   the physical robot, and characteristics of the robot's environment (e.g.
   obstacles, terrain). This paper investigates teleoperated robot driving
   time for a task that includes obstacles in an environment. We
   hypothesize that a model analogous to Fitts Law can be used to describe
   robot performance (driving time) as a function of environment
   difficulty. A new definition of the difficulty index (ID) in Fitts' Law
   is proposed in this paper that describes an environment's difficulty
   based on the arrangement of obstacles. The model is tested with data
   from a human subject study we conducted, in which a simulated
   differential drive robot was teleoperated through different environments
   in a manual control mode and semi-autonomous mode (obstacle avoidance).
   We demonstrate that the model for driving time and our proposed
   environment difficulty index fit human subject data well for a simple
   driving task between one pair of obstacles. Additionally, the model is
   expanded to predict driving time in a more complex environment with
   multiple pairs of obstacles. The results of this paper provide a
   building block for predicting teleoperated driving time performance in
   larger, more complex environments. (C) 2016, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{Hydrocephalus, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production rate is
   greater than reabsorption rate, leads to impaired neurological function
   if left untreated. Ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS) are implanted in
   the brain ventricles to route CSF. VPS systems have a high failure rate,
   and failure symptoms resemble symptoms of common maladies. The current
   gold standard for shunt diagnosis, surgical intervention, poses high
   risk and requires an expensive procedure for patients. Current
   non-invasive methods lack proper insight to assist physicians. We
   propose a noninvasive method of characterizing the oscillation of the
   shunt's pressure-relief valve to assist physicians in shunt diagnosis.
   Brightness-mode and motion-mode ultrasound images can be used to
   determine fluid flow. Blockage in the system could be detected by
   observing the phase change of the ultrasound signal in different flow
   cases with or without perturbation. Future testing and implementation
   can allow for the use of this method in localizing and identifying the
   modality of failure.}},

   study, we investigated decoding stroke patients' gait intention through
   a wireless EEG system. To overcome patient-specific EEG patterns due to
   impaired cerebral cortices, common spatial patterns (CSP) was employed.
   We demonstrated that CSP filter can be used to maximize the EEG signal
   variance-ratio of gait and standing conditions. Finally, linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA) classification was conducted, whereby the
   average accuracy of 73.2\% and the average delay of 0.13 s were achieved
   for 3 chronic stroke patients. Additionally, we also found out that the
   inverse CSP matrix topography of stroke patients' EEG showed good
   agreement with the patients' paretic side.}},

Abstract = {{For neural probes to be used chronically for years in the human body,
   they must provoke minimal scarring. Recently, a number of groups have
   reported substantially reduced scar tissue using cellular scale
   electrodes below 15 mu m in size. This size scale is accessible to
   manufacturing techniques, but can be very difficult to insert in the
   brain for most common electrode materials. In this study, we explore the
   design space available to cellular scale electrodes that will selfinsert
   into the brain. First a mathematical model is developed using beam
   buckling equations for different materials and geometries. Buckling mode
   was found to be one fixed and one hinged end resulting in a mode
   conditional constant of, n, 2.045. Model predicts insertion success
   between 90 - 100\% for a 6.8 mu m diameter electrode and was used to
   approximate applied force as 750 mu N which is close to reference data
   of 780 mu N {[}1]. Second, we developed a PVC phantom that mimics the
   brain's elastic modulus. This phantom was matched to insertion success
   data obtained from carbon fiber arrays {[}1]. Overall, these results
   enable studies to be conducted on other proposed cellular scale
   electrodes prior to animal testing or large scale fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep apneas are the most common type of sleep-related breathing
   disorders which cause a patient to move from a good sleep into an
   inefficient sleep. In addition, sleep apnea widely impacts the American
   population and is a large cost for healthcare. Traditional detection
   methods of sleep apneas are complex, expensive, and invasive to most
   patients. Among the various physiological signals, respiration signals
   are relatively easy to be monitored. However, not many studies are
   conducted using respiration signal only, and most of the previous
   algorithms are insufficient to detect apnea events. In this paper, we
   propose a new algorithm based on only the respiration signal to detect
   the apnea events during sleep and conduct experiments comparing the
   performance of our algorithm against two apnea detection algorithms. We
   use 20 patients' data, all of whom have severe Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI
   >= 30: over 30 events per hour). Our study shows that our algorithm
   outperforms the other two algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Fiberless optoelectrodes are an emerging tool to enable brain circuit
   mapping by providing precise optical modulation and electrical
   monitoring of many neurons. While optoelectrodes having an on-board
   light source offer compact and optically efficient device solutions,
   many of them fail to provide robust thermal and electrical design to
   fully exploit the recording capabilities of the device. In this work, we
   present a novel fiberless multicolor optoelectrode solution, which meets
   the optical and thermal design requirements of an in vivo neural
   optoelectrode and offers potential for low-noise neural recording. The
   total optical loss measured for 405 nm and 635 nm wavelengths through
   the waveguide is 11.7 +/- 1.1 dB and 9.9 +/- 0.7 dB, corresponding to
   respective irradiances of 1928 mW/mm(2) and 2905 mW/mm(2) at the
   waveguide tip from 6 mW laser diode chips. The efficient thermal
   packaging enables continuous device operation for up to 190 seconds at
   10\% duty cycle. We validated the fully packaged device in the intact
   brain of anesthetized mice co-expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 and
   Archaerhodopsin in the hippocampal CA1 region and achieved activation
   and silencing of the same neurons. We discuss improvements made to
   reduce the stimulation artifact induced by applying currents to the
   laser diode chips.}},

Abstract = {{Powered knee and ankle prostheses have the potential to improve the
   mobility of individuals with a lower limb amputation. As the number of
   different ambulation modes the prosthesis can be configured for
   increases, so too does the challenge of how to best transition the
   prosthesis between these modes. Pattern recognition systems have been
   suggested as a means to provide seamless and natural transitions,
   although error rates need to be reduced for these systems to be clinical
   viable. Delaying mode transitions by a small window may be one way to
   reduce error rates and improve reliability. The goal of this study was
   to develop and test a system for powered lower limb prostheses that
   introduced a delay between mode transitions. Three transfemoral amputees
   used a knee-ankle prosthesis to stand, walk on level ground,
   ascend/descend a ramp, and ascend/descend stairs. On Day 1 mode
   transitions occurred at a gait event (e.g., heel contact), and on Day 2
   mode transitions occurred 90 ms following a gait event. A mode-specific
   pattern recognition system was trained and tested on each day. The 90 ms
   transition delay did not negatively affect users' performance ambulating
   with the prosthesis. Offline classification error results showed that
   the 90 ms delay reduced overall classification errors from 1.30\%
   {[}0.29\%], mean {[}SD], for the non-delayed system to 0.42\% {[}0.22\%]
   for the delayed system. These results demonstrate that delaying mode
   transitions by a small window of time can reduce overall errors, which
   moves these systems one step closer to clinical viability.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of Bayesian learning in a dynamical system
   involving strategic agents with asymmetric information. In a series of
   seminal papers in the literature, this problem has been studied under a
   simplifying model where selfish players appear sequentially and act once
   in the game, based on private noisy observations of the system state and
   public observation of past players' actions. It is shown that there
   exist information cascades where users discard their private information
   and mimic the action of their predecessor. In this paper, we provide a
   framework for studying Bayesian learning dynamics in a more general
   setting than the one described above. In particular, our model
   incorporates cases where players participate for the whole duration of
   the game, and cases where an endogenous process selects which sub-set of
   players will act at each time instance. The proposed methodology hinges
   on a sequential decomposition for finding perfect Bayesian equilibria
   (PBE) of a general class of dynamic games with asymmetric information,
   where user-specific states evolve as conditionally independent Markov
   processes and users make independent noisy observations of their states.
   Using our methodology, we study a specific dynamic learning model where
   players make decisions about investing in the team, based on their
   estimates of everyone's types. We characterize a set of informational
   cascades for this problem where learning stops for the team as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an online version of the sparse PCA problem with missing
   data in which we seek a set of sparse orthogonal basis vectors. We are
   motivated by big data applications where we must sequentially process
   possibly incomplete vector observations to find an approximating
   subspace, and we desire the subspace representation to be sparse and
   have orthogonal columns for reasons of interpretability. We propose two
   different algorithms for solving this problem inspired by the work of
   {[}15], where the main idea is to find a rotation matrix such that the
   subspace basis is sparse after rotation. Our first algorithm is a batch
   algorithm with updates for the rotation matrix estimate using gradient
   steps on the Stiefel manifold. The second algorithm is online, and for
   each observation it performs two updates, one of the rotation matrix
   estimate and one of the subspace estimate, the latter of which is
   updated using gradient steps on the Grassmannian. The batch algorithm is
   competitive with state-of-the-art on full data. The online algorithm
   allows for a trade-off between subspace fit and sparsity of the
   subspace, and its performance degrades gracefully with missing data. We
   evaluate the performance of these two algorithms on both synthetic and
   real data.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the recent interest in abstraction-based
   correct-by-construction control synthesis, in this paper we propose a
   new algorithm to construct finite abstractions for ``large{''}, possibly
   infinite, transition systems. As opposed to the standard bisimulation
   algorithms that create a partition of the state space, the new algorithm
   uses overlapping subsets of the state space as the states of the
   abstraction. We show that the output of the new bisimulation-like
   algorithm preserves realizability of linear-time properties. Several
   interesting properties of the algorithm are analyzed. In particular,
   when a finite bisimulation of the original system exists, the new
   algorithm is shown to always terminate in a finite number of steps.
   Moreover, we show with an example that even when the original system
   does not have a finite bisimulation, the new algorithm can result in a
   finite transition system whose infinite traces are equivalent to those
   of the original system. In the second part of the paper, we focus on the
   application of this algorithm to construct finite abstractions for
   discrete-time linear control systems and discuss several of its
   advantages over the standard bisimulation algorithm. Finally, the new
   algorithm is compared to the existing algorithms with some numerical
   examples.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work in distance metric learning has focused on learning
   transformations of data that best align with specified pairwise
   similarity and dissimilarity constraints, often supplied by a human
   observer. The learned transformations lead to improved retrieval,
   classification, and clustering algorithms due to the better adapted
   distance or similarity measures. Here, we address the problem of
   learning these transformations when the underlying constraint generation
   process is nonstationary. This nonstationarity can be due to changes in
   either the ground-ruth clustering used to generate constraints or
   changes in the feature subspaces in which the class structure is
   apparent. We propose Online Convex Ensemble StrongLy Adaptive Dynamic
   Learning (OCELAD), a general adaptive, online approach for learning and
   tracking optimal metrics as they change over time that is highly robust
   to a variety of nonstationary behaviors in the changing metric. We apply
   the OCELAD framework to an ensemble of online learners. Specifically, we
   create a retro-initialized composite objective mirror descent (COMID)
   ensemble (RICE) consisting of a set of parallel COMID learners with
   different learning rates, demonstrate RICE-OCELAD on both real and
   synthetic data sets and show significant performance improvements
   relative to previously proposed batch and online distance metric
   learning algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a framework for connected cruise control (CCC)
   design utilizing wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We
   propose a sequential optimization approach to select the control
   parameters for the available communication links that allows graceful
   degradation of performance when certain links become unavailable. We
   apply the theoretical results to improve the fuel economy of a heavy
   duty vehicle while requiring head-to-tail string stability of the
   vehicle string. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed controller in improving fuel economy.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear deterministic attitude estimator is developed. The estimator
   evolves directly on the special orthogonal group of rigid-body
   rotations. Similar estimators in the literature are characterized by
   constant estimator gains that amplify noise across all frequencies. The
   proposed method accounts for undesirable noise in exteroceptive
   measurements by incorporating a strictly positive real (SPR) filter in
   the estimator structure. By tuning the ``embedded{''} SPR filter over a
   frequency bandwidth undesirable noise corrupting exteroceptive
   measurements may be rejected. Rate-gyro bias estimation is also
   considered. The proposed attitude estimator is shown to asymptotically
   converge to the desired equilibrium point (i.e., when the estimated
   attitude and bias are equal to their true counterparts), provided a
   restriction on the set of initial conditions is satisfied. Moreover,
   exponential convergence is shown in a certain region about the desired
   equilibrium point. The proposed method is demonstrated in simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Internal model control (IMC), which explicitly incorporates a plant
   model and a plant inverse as its components, has an intuitive control
   structure and simple tuning philosophy, making it appealing to
   industrial applications. Combining the IMC structure with adaptation
   through the certainty equivalence principle leads to adaptive IMC
   (AIMC), where the plant model is identified and the plant inverse is
   derived by inverting the estimated model. In Di, {[}2], we proposed the
   composite adaptive IMC (CAIMC) for a first-order plant and successfully
   applied it to the boost-pressure control problem of a turbocharged
   gasoline engine system. Within the IMC control structure, the plant
   model and the plant inverse are simultaneously identified to minimize
   modeling errors and further reduce the tracking error. Through
   theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental validation, CAIMC
   was shown to demonstrate better performance compared to AIMC. In this
   paper the design procedure of CAIMC is generalized to a nth order plant,
   and stability and asymptotic performance are established and analyzed
   under proper conditions.}},

   NMP zeros are time- dependent. The goal is to estimate the NMP zeros and
   replicate the estimated NMP zeros in the target model used by RCAC. This
   problem is challenging due to the fact that the estimates of the
   locations of the NMP zeros must be sufficiently accurate at each instant
   of time so that the target model can correctly influence the controller
   adaptation. We use closed-loop identification to estimate the location
   of the NMP zeros. In order to enhance the accuracy of the estimation, we
   inject an additional noise term in order to improve persistency of the
   control signal. Numerical examples show the feasibility and performance
   of the overall approach.}},

Abstract = {{Some LTI plants are practically impossible to control due to extremely
   small gain and phase margins. These plants tend to be either unstable or
   nonminimum phase or both. Since practical control of these plants using
   fixed-gain controllers is not feasible, it is of interest to determine
   whether adaptive control can overcome these difficulties. To investigate
   this question, we apply retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC) to a
   collection of plants that are practically impossible to control from an
   LTI perspective. For each plant, we introduce a destabilizing
   perturbation in order to determine whether or not RCAC can re-adapt in
   such a way as to compensate for the loss of margin and restabilize the
   closed-loop system without manual retuning. Since these plants are
   inherently difficult to control, it is of interest to determine whether
   or not restabilization is possible and, if so, assess the severity of
   the transient response.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a backstepping observer and an output feedback control
   law are designed for the stabilization of the one-phase Stefan problem.
   The present result is an improvement of the recent full state feedback
   backstepping controller proposed in our previous contribution. The
   one-phase Stefan problem describes the time-evolution of a temperature
   profile in a liquid-solid material and its liquid-solid moving
   interface. This phase transition problem is mathematically formulated as
   a 1-D diffusion Partial Differential Equation (PDE) of the melting zone
   defined on a time-varying spatial domain described by an Ordinary
   Differential Equation (ODE). We propose a backstepping observer allowing
   to estimate the temperature profile along the melting zone based on the
   available measurement, namely, the solid phase length. The designed
   observer and the output feedback controller ensure the exponential
   stability of the estimation errors, the moving interface, and the
   H-1-norm of the distributed temperature while keeping physical
   constraints, which is shown with the restriction on the gain parameter
   of the observer and the setpoint.}},

Abstract = {{The resistance of Lithium-ion cells increases at sub-zero temperatures
   reducing the cells' power availability. One way to improve the cells'
   performance in these adverse operation conditions is to proactively heat
   them. In this paper, we consider the scenario in which a cell is heated
   from both inside and outside; a current is drawn from the cell to power
   a convective heater; Joule heating warms the cell from inside. A problem
   formulation to derive the time-limited energy-optimal current policy is
   presented, analyzed and numerically solved. It is observed that the
   optimal current policy resembles a sequence of constant voltage,
   constant current and phases, mirroring conventional wisdom. Finally, the
   notion of productive warm-up-a warm-up procedure that ensures that the
   cell can perform work once warmed-up-is introduced; and an approximation
   of the optimal solution is used to identify the lowest state of charge
   at various operating conditions (portion of the state-space) from which
   productive warm-up is feasible.}},

Abstract = {{As we incorporate more random renewable energy into the power grid,
   power system operators need to ensure physical constraints, such as
   transmission line limits, are not violated despite uncertainty.
   Risk-constrained optimal power flow (RCOPF) based on the Conditional
   Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a convenient modeling tool, ensuring that these
   constraints are satisfied with a high probability (e.g., 95\%). However,
   in practice, it is often difficult to perfectly estimate the joint
   probability distribution of all uncertain variables, including renewable
   energy production and load consumption. In this paper, we propose a
   distributionally robust RCOPF approach by considering all possible
   probability distributions that share the same moment (e.g., mean and
   covariance) and unimodality properties. Moment and unimodality
   information can be estimated based on historical data, and so the
   proposed approach can be applied in a data-driven manner. In view of the
   computational challenges, we derive a conservative and a relaxed
   approximation of the problem. We reformulate these approximations as
   semidefinite programs (SDPs) facilitating the use of highly efficient
   off-the-shelf optimization solvers (e.g., CVX). We demonstrate the
   proposed approach based on a modified IEEE 9-bus power network.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of combined state and parameter estimation is to estimate
   both unmeasured states and unknown entries of the dynamics matrix. Since
   the dynamics involve products of states and parameters, this is a
   nonlinear estimation problem. The classical approach to this problem is
   to use the extended Kalman filter, although more recent techniques, such
   as the unscented Kalman filter, can be used. The goal of this paper is
   to determine conditions under which the combined state and parameter
   estimation problem is feasible. To do this, we recast this problem as an
   identifiability problem and, for several special cases, we develop
   necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability, which provides
   necessary and sufficient conditions for feasibility of the combined
   state and parameter estimation problem.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we deal with the control of a transport PDE/nonlinear ODE
   cascade system in which the transport coefficient depends on the ODE

   which compensates the transport dynamics of the actuator and guarantees
   global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The stability
   proof is based on an infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation
   that is introduced, with the aid of which, a Lyapunov functional is
   constructed. The relation of the PDE-ODE cascade to an ODE system with a
   state-dependent input delay, which is defined implicitly via an integral
   of the ODE state, is also highlighted and the corresponding equivalent
   predictor-feedback design is presented. The practical relevance of our
   control framework is illustrated in an example that is concerned with
   the control of a metal rolling process.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the supervisor synthesis problem for centralized
   partially-observed discrete event systems subject to safety
   specifications. It is well known that this problem does not have a
   unique supremal solution in general. Instead, there may be several
   incomparable locally maximal solutions. One then needs a mechanism to
   select one locally maximal solution. Our approach in this paper is to
   consider a lower bound specification on the controlled behavior, in
   addition to the upper bound for the safety specification. This leads to
   a generalized supervisory control problem called the range control
   problem. While the upper bound captures the (prefix closed) legal
   behavior, the lower bound captures the (prefix closed) minimum required
   behavior. We provide a synthesis algorithm that solves this problem by
   effectively constructing a maximally-permissive safe supervisor that
   contains the required lower bound behavior. This is the first algorithm
   with such properties, as previous works solve either the maximally
   permissive safety problem (with no lower bound), or the lower bound
   containment problem (without maximal permissiveness).}},

Abstract = {{Accurately modeling and verifying the correct operation of systems
   interacting in dynamic environments is challenging. By leveraging
   parametric uncertainty within the model description, one can relax the
   requirement to describe interactions with the environment exactly;
   however, one must still guarantee that the model, despite uncertainty,
   behaves acceptably. This paper presents a convex optimization method to
   compute the set of configurations of a polynomial dynamical system that
   are able to safely reach a user defined target set despite parametric
   uncertainty. Since planning in the presence of uncertainty can lead to
   undesirable conservativeness, this paper computes those trajectories of
   the uncertain nonlinear systems that are alpha-probable of reaching the
   desired configuration. The presented approach uses the notion of
   occupation measures to describe the evolution of trajectories of a
   nonlinear system with parametric uncertainty as a linear equation over
   measures whose supports coincide with the trajectories under
   investigation. This linear equation is approximated with vanishing
   conservatism using a hierarchy of semidefinite programs each of which is
   proven to compute an approximation to the set of initial conditions that
   are alpha-probable of reaching the user defined target set safely
   despite uncertainty. The efficacy of this method is illustrated on three
   systems with parametric uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we employ hierarchy in order to greatly reduce the
   computational complexity for generating the optimal control for a
   discrete event system. Specifically, we propose a formal notion of
   equivalence we term cost equivalence that we use to generate an
   abstraction of a weighted automaton representing a supervisory
   controller. We demonstrate that this abstraction can be employed for
   planning, even in the presence of events that cannot be controlled.
   Furthermore, we propose additional requirements that we show guarantee
   that the plan generated from the abstracted automaton achieves optimal
   behavior when applied to the original unabstracted automaton. The
   results we generate in this paper have application to a broad class of
   graph-search problems.}},

Abstract = {{Composing controllers designed individually for interacting subsystems,
   while preserving the guarantees that each controller provides for each
   subsystem, is a challenging task. Motivated by this challenge, we
   consider in this paper the problem of synthesizing safety controllers
   for linear parameter-varying subsystems, where the system matrices of
   each subsystem depend (possibly nonlinearly) on the states of the other
   subsystems. In particular, we propose a method for synthesis of
   controlled invariant sets and associated controllers, that is robust
   against affine parametric uncertainties in the system matrices. Then we
   show for certain classes of parameter dependencies how to quantify the
   uncertainty imposed on the other subsystems by convexifying, with an
   affine map, the effects of these parameters. An analysis of this
   quantification is provided. In the second part of the paper, we focus on
   an application of this method to vehicle safety systems. We demonstrate
   how controllers for lane-keeping and adaptive cruise control can be
   synthesized in a compositional way using the proposed method. Our
   simulations illustrate how these controllers keep their individual
   safety guarantees when implemented simultaneously, as the theory
   suggests.}},

   one-controller-at-a-time adaptation, one subcontroller is adapted with
   the other subcontroller fixed at zero. The first subcontroller is then
   fixed while the second subcontroller is adapted taking into account the
   NMP closed-loop channel zeros. We also consider concurrent adaptation,
   where both controllers are updated at the same time. Finally, we apply
   this technique to decentralized control of the position and shape of a

Abstract = {{We consider a finite horizon dynamic game with two players who observe
   their types privately and take actions, which are publicly observed.
   Players' types evolve as independent, controlled linear Gaussian
   processes and players incur quadratic instantaneous costs. This forms a
   dynamic linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) game with asymmetric
   information. We show that under certain conditions, players' strategies
   that are linear in their private types, together with Gaussian beliefs
   form a perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) of the game. Furthermore, it
   is shown that this is a signaling equilibrium due to the fact that
   future beliefs on players' types are affected by the equilibrium
   strategies. We provide a backward-forward algorithm to find the PBE.
   Each step of the backward algorithm reduces to solving an algebraic
   matrix equation for every possible realization of the state estimate
   covariance matrix. The forward algorithm consists of Kalman filter
   recursions, where state estimate covariance matrices depend on
   equilibrium strategies.}},

   straightforward. In contrast to common numerical search methods for
   periodic orbits, this paper introduces a class of holonomic constraints,
   called symmetric virtual constraints, which when enforced by
   controllers, ensure the existence of periodic orbits. The main advantage
   of symmetric virtual constraints is that they relax the need for online
   or offline parameter search for periodic orbits, and at the same time
   lead directly to feedback controllers that realize a periodic orbit.}},

Abstract = {{Actor-action semantic segmentation made an important step toward
   advanced video understanding: what action is happening; who is
   performing the action; and where is the action happening in space-time.
   Current methods based on layered CRFs for this problem are local and
   unable to capture the long-ranging interactions of video parts. We
   propose a new model that combines the labeling CRF with a supervoxel
   hierarchy, where supervoxels at various scales provide cues for possible
   groupings of nodes in the CRF to encourage adaptive and long-ranging
   interactions. The new model defines a dynamic and continuous process of
   information exchange: the CRF influences what supervoxels in the
   hierarchy are active, and these active supervoxels, in turn, affect the
   connectivities in the CRF; we hence call it a grouping process model. By
   further incorporating the video-level recognition, the proposed method
   achieves a large margin of 60\% relative improvement over the state of
   the art on the recent A2D large-scale video labeling dataset, which
   demonstrates the effectiveness of our modeling.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation algorithm
   based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Contrary to existing
   weakly-supervised approaches, our algorithm exploits auxiliary
   segmentation annotations available for different categories to guide
   segmentations on images with only image-level class labels. To make
   segmentation knowledge transferrable across categories, we design a
   decoupled encoder-decoder architecture with attention model. In this
   architecture, the model generates spatial highlights of each category
   presented in images using an attention model, and subsequently performs
   binary segmentation for each highlighted region using decoder. Combining
   attention model, the decoder trained with segmentation annotations in
   different categories boosts accuracy of weakly-supervised semantic
   segmentation. The proposed algorithm demonstrates substantially improved
   performance compared to the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised
   techniques in PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset when our model is trained with the
   annotations in 60 exclusive categories in Microsoft COCO dataset.}},

   gas (2DEG) in an AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. Micro-fabricated Lamb wave
   delay lines are used to launch and guide travelling acoustic waves
   through the 2DEG region, resulting in a DC current flow between two
   ohmic contacts positioned on the delay line. The Lamb wave delay line
   shows much better acoustic transmission efficiency than the conventional
   surface acoustic wave (SAW) counterpart. The dependence of AE current on
   RF power and frequency is also verified.}},

   double D (SDD) coil is proposed to have a good interoperability with the
   double D (DD) coil and the unipolar coil. To ensure high power transfer
   efficiency, tolerance for different gap variation and horizontal
   misalignment conditions are investigated in IPT systems. A 3D finite

   they fail to fully emulate the entirety of real dynamics. Despite this,
   these imperfect models are still useful in practice, so long as one
   knows how the model is inexact. This inexactness is measured by a
   discrepancy between the proposed stochastic model and a true stochastic
   distribution across multiple values of some decision variables. In this
   paper, we propose a method to learn the discrepancy of a stochastic
   simulation using data collected from the system of interest. Our

Abstract = {{One of the most critical and costly decisions made in emergency
   departments (EDs) is whether to admit a patient into the hospital. These
   decisions require investment in time for patient testing and treatment,
   delaying care to other patients. Short-stay units (SSUs) are an
   alternative to discharging or fully admitting ED patients, allowing
   extended patient observation. However, little is understood about the
   design of an SSU and its impact on outcomes and congestion. Here, we
   introduce a discrete-event simulation model of a hospital system (ED,
   inpatient units, and SSUs). By analyzing records from a tertiary
   teaching hospital, we determine realistic parameters and identify
   important features, such as triage level and processes depending on
   triage level, time, and congestion. We contend that performance metrics,
   e.g. time to first contact, critically depend on downstream hospital
   units. To demonstrate utility, we use the simulation model to assess bed
   occupancy over time.}},

Abstract = {{People spend most of their time in indoor building environments. Thus,
   providing a comfortable living environment to the occupants is of
   extreme importance. Adaptive thermal comfort models developed through
   many studies suggested that the dynamic thermal based behavior of
   occupants can be utilized to optimize various energy influencing
   processes in the building. However, there is little research on how
   these behavioral patterns can be controlled and influenced using
   appropriate interventions. In this study, an agent-based model
   simulating zone-wise thermal comfort level of occupants in an office
   building is coupled with the energy simulation model through Lightweight
   Communications and Marshalling (LCM), a distributed computing framework.
   Case study results demonstrate the LCM framework's ability to
   communicate between simulation models across various spatially
   distributed workstations and allow for the quantification of the energy
   saving potential of various thermal comfort based interventions.}},

Abstract = {{By imitating chaotic disaster situations in risk-free settings,
   disaster-related simulation can be helpful for training of response
   participation, damage evaluation, and recovery planning. However, each
   single simulation needs to interact with others because different
   simulation combinations are required due to numerous disasters and their
   complex effects on facilities, and diverse response efforts. We
   therefore developed a distributed simulation platform for disaster
   response management by using the High Level Architecture (HLA) (IEEE
   1516) to promote its future extendibility. With a focus on the facility
   damage after an earthquake and fire, disaster response
   simulations-including evacuation, emergency recovery, and
   restoration-interact with a seismic data feeds, and structural response
   and building fire simulations. This base platform can provide
   information on possible damages and response situations to reduce
   confusions in disaster responses. With the strongest features of HLA,
   which is reusability and extendibility, additional disaster simulators
   could be coupled for all-time disaster management.}},

Abstract = {{Buildings contribute a major component of the world's total energy
   consumption. During the design phase, building energy simulation models
   can be used to predict building performance and design energy-efficient
   buildings that consume an optimal amount of energy, if operated and
   maintained within the confines of energy model assumptions. Similarly,
   Dynamic Data-Driven Simulation and Analysis (DDDSA) methods can be used
   during the operation and maintenance phase of buildings. Such methods
   allow models to be seeded periodically with real-time data that
   influences the simulation system for better analysis and prediction of
   system performance. In order to optimize energy consumption in buildings
   and subsequently improve their energy efficiency, buildings need to be
   monitored and various forms of copious data need to be collected to
   support DDDSA. The primary objective of this paper is to classify
   different data types that affect the energy consumption in buildings,
   and provide a comprehensive review of the existing data collection
   methods. The taxonomy developed, relevance of each data type along with
   the general characteristics of different data collection methods are
   discussed. Finally, challenges and limitations of gathering data with
   existing data collection methods in the context of building energy
   management are described along with proposed areas for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Since modern electric systems require to support various power-demand
   operations for user applications and system maintenance, they need
   advanced power management that jointly considers power demand by the
   operations and power supply from various sources, such as batteries,
   solar panels, and supercapacitors. In this paper, we develop a power
   scheduling framework for a reliable energy storage system with multiple
   power-supply sources and multiple power-demand operations. First, we
   provide an offline power-supply guarantee such that every power-demand
   operation completes its execution in time while the sum of power
   required by individual operations does not exceed the total power
   supplied by the entire energy storage system at any time. We find
   similarities between this and a real-time scheduling problem, and make a
   power-supply guarantee using real-time scheduling techniques. Second, we
   propose online power management that efficiently utilizes the surplus
   power (available at run-time) for system performance improvement. Our
   experimental results on a prototype demonstrate that the proposed
   framework not only guarantees the required power-supply, but also
   enhances system performance by up to 33.1\%.}},

Title = {{Automated building information modeling for fault detection and
   diagnostics in commercial HVAC systems}},
Journal = {{FACILITIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{233-246}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Organizations involved in facility management (FM) can use
   building information modeling (BIM) as a knowledge repository to
   document evolving facility information and to support decisions made by
   the facility managers during the operational life of a facility. Despite
   ongoing advances in FM technologies, FM practices in most facilities are
   still labor intensive, time consuming and often rely on unreliable and
   outdated information. To address these shortcomings, the purpose of this
   study is to propose an automated approach that demonstrates the
   potential of using BIM to develop algorithms that automate
   decision-making for FM applications.
   Design/methodology/approach - A BIM plug-in tool is developed that uses
   a fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) algorithm to automate the
   process of detecting malfunctioning heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning (HVAC) equipment. The algorithm connects to a complaint
   ticket database and automates BIM to determine potentially damaged HVAC
   system components and develops a plan of action for the facility
   inspectors accordingly. The approach has been implemented as a case
   study in an operating facility to improve the process of HVAC system
   diagnosis and repair.
   Findings - By implementing the proposed application in a case study, the
   authors found that automated BIM approaches such as the one developed in
   this study, can be highly beneficial in FM practices by increasing
   productivity and lowering costs associated with decision-making.
   Originality/value - This study introduces an innovative approach that
   leverages BIM for automated fault detection in operational buildings. FM
   personnel in charge of HVAC inspection and repair can highly benefit
   from the proposed approach, as it eliminates the time required to locate
   HVAC equipment at fault manually.}},

   Method}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{1-20}},
Abstract = {{Energy conservation is an important consideration in wave scattering and
   transmission from random rough surfaces and is particularly important in
   passive microwave remote sensing. In this paper, we study energy
   conservation in scattering from layered random rough surfaces using the
   second order small perturbation method (SPM2). SPM2 includes both first
   order incoherent scattering and a second order correction to the
   coherent fields. They are combined to compute the total reflected and
   transmitted powers, as a sum of integrations over wavenumber k(x), in
   which each integration includes the surface power spectra of a rough
   interface weighted by an emission kernel function (assuming the
   roughness of each interface is uncorrelated). We calculate the
   corresponding kernel functions which are the power spectral densities
   for one-dimensional (1D) surfaces in 2D scattering problems and examine
   numerical results for the cases of 2 rough interfaces and 51 rough
   interfaces. Because it is known that the SPM when evaluated to second
   order conserves energy, and it can be applied to second order for
   arbitrary surface power spectra, energy conservation can be shown to be
   satisfied for each value of kx in the kernel functions. The numerical
   examples show that energy conservation is obeyed for any dielectric
   contrast, any layer configuration and interface, and arbitrary roughness
   spectra. The values of reflected or transmitted powers predicted,
   however, are accurate only to second order in small surface roughness.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of assistive devices used during walking is often measured
   as a reduction in metabolic cost. Metabolic cost is typically assessed
   within a day or on multiple days, yet the benefit of performing
   within-day vs. between-day metabolic assessments is unknown. The purpose
   of this study was to determine the within-day minimal detectable change
   of standard measures of physiologic performance using a conventional
   portable metabolic system (K4b(2) Cosmed, Rome, Italy), and compare
   these to between-day values. Twenty healthy adults completed two
   identical data collection sessions on separate days. In each session
   they performed three bouts of treadmill walking interspersed with three
   bouts of rest while oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production,
   and heart rate were measured. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)
   and minimal detectable change values were calculated for non-resting
   within-day, as well as all between-day comparisons. All within-day
   measures were clinically reliable (ICC > 0.96), while between-day
   measures were generally less reliable (ICCs > 0.82). Within-day minimal
   detectable change values (walking heart rate = 4.9 bpm; gross VO2 = 0.80
   mL/kg/min; net VO2 = 0.80 mL/kg/min; cost of transport = 0.022 J/Nm)
   were about half as large as between-day values. The results of this
   study suggest that, where possible, physiologic changes should be
   assessed within a single day of testing to maximize ability to detect
   small changes in performance.}},

Abstract = {{The enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has been extensively used in
   biochemistry for its ability to amplify a weak signal. By using HRP
   catalyzed substrate as the gain medium, we demonstrate sensitive ion
   concentration detection based on the optofluidic laser. The enzyme
   catalyzed reaction occurs in bulk solution inside a Fabry-Perot laser
   cavity, where the colorless, non-fluorescent
   10-Acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (ADHP) substrate is oxidized to
   produce highly fluorescent resorufin. Laser emission is achieved when
   pumped with the second harmonic wave of a Q-switched YAG laser. Further,
   we use sulfide anion (S2-) as an example to investigate the sensing
   performance of enzyme catalyzed optofluidic laser. The laser onset time
   difference between the sample to be tested and the reference is set to
   be the sensing output. Thanks to the amplification effects of both the
   enzymatic reaction and laser emission, we achieve a detection limit of
   10 nM and a dynamic range of 3 orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The paper considers formulations of constrained model predictive control
   (MPC) problems for systems with dynamics defined on smooth manifolds.
   Generalizations of conventional nonlinear MPC stabilization techniques
   based on the terminal set and terminal penalty approaches are presented
   based on recent work by the authors. The significance of the results
   includes the possibility of systematically generating globally
   stabilizing, discontinuous, time-invariant feedback laws in situations
   when smooth, or even continuous, globally stabilizing, time-invariant
   stabilizers do not exist. To illustrate the development of nonlinear MPC
   on manifolds, the paper considers an example of a system with dynamics
   evolving on SE (3). Such systems emerge in many applications, such as
   quadrotor and quadcopter flight control. In the example, the paper
   demonstrates semi-global stabilization properties of the nonlinear MPC
   feedback law.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript details the first experimental application of a spatial
   Iterative Learning Control (SILC) update law recently described by the
   authors. Previous work introduced SILC, the SILC mathematical framework
   that was based on a 2D impulse response description of spatial dynamics,
   stability analyses, and a simulation study. Herein, we describe the
   physical system comprised of a micro-scale additive manufacturing system
   termed electrohydrodynamic jet printing and a spatial metrology system,
   atomic force microscopy. For this process, process variability is
   pronounced (+/- 15\% from nominal) and thus complicates the use of
   heuristics-based process maps. This manuscript demonstrates that SILC
   applied to this combined manufacturing and in situ metrology system is
   capable, through successive iterations, of automatically creating a
   material droplet array that approximates an ideal material topography by
   compensating for process variability. These results give promise to more
   rigorous experimental trials involving multi-material and multi-layer
   micro additive manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional mechanical damping systems employ dissipative components,
   such as viscous dampers, to absorb energy from an externally excited
   vibratory structure, and dissipate this energy as heat. By contrast,
   self-powered damping systems employ transducers to convert absorbed
   mechanical energy into electrical energy, which is then managed in an
   electrical network. This enables the network to intelligently control
   and adapt the damping properties of the devices in real-time, and to use
   the extracted energy to power the control intelligence and power
   electronic subsystems. In order for the system to have energy-autonomy,
   the transducers must extract sufficient energy to overcome the parasitic
   losses in the system, and to maintain the static power requirements of
   the control intelligence. In this paper we present a nonlinear control
   design technique for this technology, which is based on multi-objective
   LQG control. The technique has the objective of strongly reducing one
   performance measure in stochastic response, subject to constraints on
   other performance measures, as well as on the power generated by the
   system. The technique is described generically, and is demonstrated on
   an application with relevance to earthquake engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of using control actions to communicate is called
   signaling. Signaling is often beneficial in decentralized control
   problems with imperfect communication between agents. Seemingly simple
   control problems with signaling are often mathematically challenging.
   Humans, however, lack high-speed communication channels and routinely
   employ signaling strategies during cooperative movements. This paper
   presents a computationally tractable two-player problem that models
   several salient features of signaling problems arising in both
   decentralized control and human experiments. The problem consists of a
   signaler that reaches towards one of two possible targets, and an
   observer that decides on the target location based on noisy measurements
   of the movement. The signaler trades off control costs, such as energy,
   with informa-tiveness for the observer. Two variants, the unambiguous
   case and the ambiguous case, are presented. In the unambiguous case, the
   signaler makes movements that are easy to distinguish, while in the
   ambiguous case, the signaler maximizes similarity of the movements. An
   approximation method for nonlinear systems is presented. When applied to
   a three-link arm model, the control scheme reproduces qualitative
   signaling phenomena observed in human reaching experiments.}},

   the input observer, a jump diffusion process estimator is developed to
   estimate the states and shown to have better performance than the Kalman
   filter when jumps such as potholes and bumps are present. Furthermore, a
   real-time road anomaly detection algorithm is designed to detect and

   algorithms are implemented in real time on a test vehicle and

Abstract = {{This paper describes a game theoretical model of traffic where multiple
   drivers interact with each other. The model is developed using
   hierarchical reasoning, a game theoretical model of human behavior, and
   reinforcement learning. It is assumed that the drivers can observe only
   a partial state of the traffic they are in and therefore although the
   environment satisfies the Markov property, it appears as non-Markovian
   to the drivers. Hence, each driver implicitly has to find a policy, i.e.
   a mapping from observations to actions, for a Partially Observable
   Markov Decision Process. In this paper, a computationally tractable
   solution to this problem is provided by employing hierarchical reasoning
   together with a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation
   results are reported, which demonstrate that the resulting driver models
   provide reasonable behavior for the given traffic scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Output regulation and the identification of plant parameters are
   generally conflicting objectives. However, over-actuated systems provide
   an opportunity to achieve identification and control objectives
   simultaneously, with minimal compromise. This paper presents an
   optimization-based simultaneous identification and control (SIC)
   methodology for permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) which
   exploits the over-actuated nature of the machine. A receding horizon
   control allocation (RHCA) approach is used which includes a metric for
   maximizing the excitation characteristics of the generated reference
   current trajectories. The reference currents produced by the RHCA are
   fed to a lower-level adaptive current regulator which ensures asymptotic
   tracking of a reference model. The importance of reformulating the RHCA
   problem to include past input and state data, in addition to predicting
   future input and state trajectories, is discussed. Simulation results
   demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed RHCA-SIC methodology, as
   well as the effects of neglecting past input and state data, are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a cooperative control design for an aerial/ground
   robot system, and addresses the problem of maintaining visibility of a
   quadrotor within the camera field-of-view of a ground robot in the
   presence of external disturbances. The quadrotor needs to be tracked by
   the ground robot with a monocular camera, and hence its motion should
   facilitate the ground vision-based tracking process by remaining in the
   effective camera sensing area. We design a model predictive controller
   (MPC) strategy where the visibility constraints of the camera and the
   control input constraints of the quadrotor are encoded into the cost
   function via barrier functions, and we adopt a fast MPC solver that is
   able to solve the optimization problem in real time. We also propose a
   method to enhance the robustness of the algorithm by suitably defining a
   restart method for the MPC solver. The applicability of the proposed
   algorithm is demonstrated through simulations and experimental results

Abstract = {{This paper treats the control design for semiactive suspension systems
   using the recently-developed theory of Quasi-Linear Control (QLC). The
   use of QLC facilitates handling actuator constraints in semi-active
   suspensions and the design of nonlinear output feedback laws. Our
   approach consists of three steps. First, a semi-active suspension
   control law is defined as a polynomial function of the velocity
   difference between the sprung and unsprung masses. Then, QLC is employed
   to stochastically linearize the polynomial function within the
   closed-loop system. Finally, using the linearized system, a constrained
   optimization problem is formulated and solved to generate the
   coefficients of the polynomial function. This approach leads to a
   nonlinear feedback control law, which explicitly takes into account the
   actuator constraints. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate
   the efficacy of this approach as compared with clipped linear quadratic
   Gaussian control, which is an existing approach used in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a black-box modeling framework for connected
   vehicle networks comprised of conventional vehicles and vehicles
   equipped with wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. First, we

   broadcasting and the host vehicle. Based on the estimated link length, a
   linear model is used to approximate the dynamics of the vehicle network.
   The proposed framework does not require priori information about the
   dynamics of the vehicle network, and hence can be implemented in real
   traffic. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the estimators in capturing the link length and predicting the time
   evolution of the vehicle network. The estimated model can be used when
   designing connected cruise control (CCC) algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies pursuit-evasion games that feature two players moving
   in the plane, where one is a pursuer and the other is an evader. The
   goal of the pursuer is to capture the evader, which requires the
   distance between the pursuer and the evader to become smaller than a
   prescribed constant. The goal of the evader is to avoid capture.
   Specifically, this paper focuses on the Homicidal Chauffeur problem,
   where the pursuer has a speed advantage, but the evader has a
   maneuverability advantage. The key achievement of this paper is that it
   analyzes the game using dominance regions, where a point in the
   environment is said to be dominated by the evader if the evader can
   reach the point without being captured, regardless of the actions of the
   pursuer. This analysis method has recently been applied to games with
   obstacles and games with uncertain measurements, but in those cases the
   players all move with simple motion, where they are able to turn
   instantaneously. Dominance regions have not been applied to the
   Homicidal Chauffeur problem in the existing literature. One benefit of
   this approach is that the optimal strategies follow from the
   construction of the dominance regions.}},

Abstract = {{Internal model control (IMC) offers an intuitive control structure and
   simple tuning philosophy, which makes it appealing to industrial
   applications. In our recent work {[}1], we proposed composite adaptive
   IMC (CAIMC) which simultaneously identified the model and the inverse in
   the IMC structure. It demonstrates good performance and auto-tuning
   capability in simulations and experiments. In this paper, an innovative
   approach is taken to express the IMC tracking error in terms of the
   modeling error and right-inverse modeling error, which analytically
   justifies the CAIMC design and its auto-tuning property. This new
   expression of the tracking error also suggests reformulation of the
   inverse model estimation problem, leading to enhanced CAIMC performance.
   The CAIMC from {[}1] and the enhanced CAIMC with the reformulated
   inverse are presented and compared, and applied to the boost-pressure
   control problem of a turbocharged gasoline engine. Results from
   simulations on a proprietary model and experiments on a vehicle with a
   turbocharged 2.0L engine are presented to demonstrate the advantages of
   the enhanced CAIMC.}},

Abstract = {{Condition monitoring and condition-based maintenance can reduce
   maintenance costs and improve operation safety of vehicles across the
   full spectrum of transportation domain, including automotive, rail, air
   and marine applications. In this paper, a set-membership condition
   monitoring framework is proposed to detect aging and health degradation
   for dual fuel engines based on simultaneous input and parameter
   estimation techniques. Dual fuel engines operate in two modes, a diesel
   mode or gas mode, and can burn either diesel fuel or natural gas fuel.
   To improve health parameter identifiability, we exploit transient data
   from mode transitions between the diesel mode and gas mode. Simulation
   results based on a nonlinear mean-value model of the engine are
   reported, demonstrating that the proposed set-membership estimation
   algorithms can provide tight overbound of the health parameters.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a finite horizon dynamic game with N selfish players who
   observe their types privately and take actions, which are publicly
   observed. Players' types evolve as conditionally independent Markov
   processes, conditioned on their current actions. Their actions and types
   jointly determine their instantaneous rewards. Since each player has a
   different information set, this forms a dynamic game with asymmetric
   information and there is no known methodology to find perfect Bayesian
   equilibria (PBE) for such games in general. In this paper, we provide a
   two-step backward-forward recursive algorithm to find a class of PBE
   using a belief state based on common information of the players. We
   refer to such equilibria as structured Bayesian perfect equilibria
   (SPBE). The backward recursive part of this algorithm defines an
   equilibrium generating function. Each period in the backward recursion
   involves solving a fixed point equation on the space of probability
   simplexes for every possible belief on types. Using this function,
   equilibrium strategies and beliefs are defined through a forward
   recursion. We provide a public goods example to demonstrate the
   methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to provide a tutorial on retrospective cost
   adaptive control (RCAC). RCAC is a discrete-time adaptive control
   technique that is applicable to stabilization, command following, and
   disturbance rejection. RCAC is based on the concept of retrospectively
   optimized control, where past controller coefficients used to generate
   past control inputs are re-optimized in the sense that if the
   re-optimized coefficients had been used over a previous window of
   operation, then the performance would have been better. Unlike signal
   processing applications such as estimation and identification, it is
   impossible to change past control inputs, and thus the re-optimized
   controller coefficients are used only to generate the next control
   input. This paper presents a tutorial on the algorithmic details of RCAC
   including the construction of the retrospective cost, the role of the
   target model, and the effect of tuning parameters. Numerical examples
   are given to illustrate each of these choices as well as the performance
   of RCAC for command following and disturbance rejection under minimal
   modeling of the plant dynamics and exogenous inputs. Properties of the
   closed-loop system are also compared to features of discrete-time,
   high-authority LQG controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Active feedback noise control for rejecting broadband disturbances must
   contend with the Bode integral constraint, which implies that
   suppression over some frequency range gives rise to amplification over
   another range. This is called spectral spillover. In the present paper,
   we apply retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC) to active noise
   suppression in the interior of an automobile. This study highlights
   spectral spillover along with related issues, such as the need for
   controller stability, the effect of plant rolloff at DC, and the
   challenge of nonminimum-phase zeros. Beyond these issues, this paper
   deals with spatial spillover, which refers to the amplification of noise
   at locations where no microphone is located. Typically, this issue is
   dealt with by restricting the bandwidth to a frequency range within
   which the acoustic wavelength is sufficiently large such that the phase
   shift between sensor locations is minimal. However, in this study we
   show that this design guideline is not valid in the case where
   obstructions (such as the driver of the vehicle) are present. This study
   illuminates the interaction among modeling and hardware issues within
   the context of a real-world application. At the same time, it provides a
   case study illustrating RCAC and its performance and requirements in
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC) is a discrete-time adaptive
   control algorithm for stabilization, command following, and disturbance
   rejection. RCAC requires knowledge of the nonminimum- phase (NMP) zeros
   in the transfer function from the control input to the performance
   variable. This knowledge is embedded in the target model used to define
   the retrospective performance variable. Without this knowledge, RCAC has
   a tendency to cancel unmodeled NMP zeros. The contribution of the
   present paper is an extension of RCAC that alleviates the need to know
   the NMP zeros a priori. In particular, concurrent optimization is used
   to update the coefficients of the controller and target model, thus
   providing estimates of the unmodeled NMP zeros. Since the retrospective
   cost is a biquadratic function of these coefficients, an alternating
   convex search algorithm takes advantage of the closed-form minimizers of
   both quadratic cost functions. For comparison, the Matlab fminsearch
   routine is used to jointly optimize the controller and target model.
   These techniques are illustrated for SISO plants that are asymptotically
   stable, unstable, minimum phase, and nonminimum phase.}},

Abstract = {{The regulation of fuel consumption and emissions around the world is
   based on standard drive (SD) cycles. Several autonomous or simple
   eco-driving methods of smoother driving and smaller acceleration and
   braking can violate the +/- 2 MPH speed deviation regulation from the SD
   and hence they are currently not counted towards the vehicle fuel
   economy, even though they are acceptable from a traffic pattern
   perspective, namely following a vehicle at a safe and reasonable gap.
   This paper develops and suggests a prototypical vehicle velocity versus
   time trajectory that supersedes each SD cycle since the SD cycle is the
   vehicle trace from following a vehicle with the prototypical velocity
   trace. The prototypical velocity trace is named from now on as the
   Hypothetical Lead (HL) vehicle cycle. In essence, the HL cycle recreates
   the traffic conditions followed by the drivers of the standard drive
   cycles. Finally, the paper concludes with a demonstration of using the
   HL cycle for assessing the fuel economy benefits of autonomous following
   in relation to standard test cycles and limits on the following
   distances to ensure that the different drive traces follow the same
   prototypical traffic conditions in a reasonable and safe way for real
   world applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops adaptive methods to control thermostatic loads that
   are subject to disturbances, with the broader purpose of providing
   real-time energy balancing for the electrical grid. For this
   application, most previous research has focused on the control problem -
   coordinating large populations of thermostatically controlled loads -
   without considering the effect that biased disturbances to the plant
   would have on system performance. To address this issue, we have
   designed online adaptive methods that manage such disturbances. One
   adaptive method uses state measurements to update the autonomous
   dynamics of the plant model, and the other method uses aggregate power
   consumption data. We consider three types of disturbances, and we
   compare the performance of the adaptive control systems to benchmark
   control systems when different combinations of these disturbances are
   active. The largest improvement in RMS tracking error due to adaptive
   control occurs when all three disturbance types are affecting the
   system. In this case, the best adaptive method results in an error of
   7.19\%, as compared with an error of 9.44\% with the best benchmark
   control system.}},

   engineers. The current paper presents a novel hierarchically optimized
   fuzzy controller to overcome this confrontation. The overall strategy of
   choosing between conflicting linguistic rules and determination of the
   knowledge-based of the system is discussed and explained in detail. A
   fuzzy controller is then designed which is optimized in two steps: At
   the first, genetic algorithm is used in the integer programming mode to
   partially optimize the knowledge-based of the system; In the second
   stage, the designed controller is optimized for performance enhancement.
   Simulation results ensure the stability and performance of the proposed
   optimal fuzzy controller.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach for co-state initialization which is a
   crucial step in solving minimum-time low-thrust trajectory optimization
   problems using indirect optimal control numerical methods. Indirect
   methods used in determining the optimal space trajectories result in
   two-point boundary value problems which are typically solved by singleor
   multiple-shooting methods. Accurate initialization of the so-called
   co-state variables is necessary to achieve numerical convergence of
   iterative boundary value problem solvers. In this paper, we propose a
   method which exploits the trajectory generated by a shape-based method
   to estimate the initial values of the co-states. The performance of the
   algorithm is compared against two other approaches which respectively
   exploit random initialization of the co-states and a genetic algorithm.
   It is shown that by using the proposed approach, numerical convergence
   is improved especially for trajectories with higher number of
   revolutions.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal management is very important to guarantee ideal performance of
   compact vehicle engines. One challenge in the vehicle engine thermal
   management is to control the engine temperature in a small interval
   while tolerating component failures and the uncertainties in complex
   environment and different operating conditions. We formulate this
   control problem as a temporal logic game for a switched affine system
   and solve it by synthesizing a switching protocol based on an
   abstraction. The existing algorithms for computing abstractions either
   cannot handle parametric uncertainties in the dynamics or can be
   computationally expensive. Besides, they usually do not deal with
   possible component failures. The main contribution of this work is to
   show: (i) how to compute an abstraction more efficiently under the
   assumption that the vector fields are multiaffine in constant
   uncertainties and affine in state variables, (ii) how to result in a
   graceful degradation in case of component failures.}},

   Stability analysis is used to determine whether a previously computed

   Building upon necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality of a
   spanning tree, we derive a polyhedral description of the stability
   region, that is, the set of all perturbations to the edge weights for
   which a given minimum spanning tree remains optimal, and analyze its
   properties and relevant subsets. The application of sensitivity analysis
   to robustness assessment of an optimal communication topology for teams

Abstract = {{Feedback control laws which create asymptotically stable periodic orbits
   for hybrid systems are an effective means for realizing dynamic legged
   locomotion in bipedal robots. To address the challenge of designing such
   control laws, we recently introduced a method to systematically select a
   stabilizing feedback control law from a parameterized family of feedback
   laws by solving an offline optimization problem. The method has been
   used elsewhere to design a stable gait based on virtual constraints, and
   its potential effectiveness was illustrated via simulation results. In
   this paper, we present the first experimental demonstration of a
   controller designed using this new offline optimization method. The new
   controller is compared with a nominal controller in experiments on
   MARLO, a 3D point-foot bipedal robot. Compared to the nominal
   controller, the optimized controller leads to improved lateral control
   and longer sustained walking.}},

   filter built from the Markov parameters of the nonminimum-phase (NMP)

   estimate of the location of the NMP zero; the filter's order is chosen
   to correspond to the number of time steps after which the plant's step

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach for systematic reduced-parameter-set
   adaption applicable to internal combustion engine models. The presented
   idea is to detect the most influential parameters in an engine
   air-charge path model and then use them as a reduced-parameter-set for
   further calibration to improve the model accuracy. Since only most
   influential parameters (in comparison with a complete set of parameters)
   are tuned at the final calibration process, this approach helps reducing
   over-parameterization associated with tuning highly nonlinear engine
   models. Detection of the influential parameters is done using the
   sensitivity analysis followed by the principle component analysis.
   Accuracy of the reduced-parameter- set tuned model is compared to a
   model with a tuned full-parameter-set developed following commercially
   available OnRAMP Design Suite {[}1] methodology. Results from
   experiments on a heavy duty diesel (HDD) engine show that although
   tuning the full-parameter-set (with over 70 parameters) creates higher
   accuracy, an average of 50\% improvement of the model accuracy is
   attained using the proposed reduced-parameter-set approach (which tunes
   only 2 parameters).}},

Abstract = {{To verify the correct operation of systems, engineers need to determine
   the set of configurations of a dynamical model that are able to safely
   reach a specified configuration under a control law. Unfortunately,
   constructing models for systems interacting in highly dynamic
   environments is difficult. This paper addresses this challenge by
   presenting a convex optimization method to efficiently compute the set
   of configurations of a polynomial hybrid dynamical system that are able
   to safely reach a user defined target set despite parametric uncertainty
   in the model. This class of models describes, for example, legged robots
   moving over uncertain terrains. The presented approach utilizes the
   notion of occupation measures to describe the evolution of trajectories
   of a nonlinear hybrid dynamical system with parametric uncertainty as a
   linear equation over measures whose supports coincide with the
   trajectories under investigation. This linear equation with user defined
   support constraints is approximated with vanishing conservatism using a
   hierarchy of semidefinite programs each of which is proven to compute an
   outer approximation to the set of initial conditions that can reach the
   user defined target set safely in spite of uncertainty. The efficacy of
   this method is illustrated on a pair of systems with parametric
   uncertainty.}},

   is used to compensate for the error between the estimated and actual

   constraints on control and landing speed while performing collision
   avoidance. The spacecraft landing mission is divided into two phases. In
   the first, circumnavigating phase an ellipsoidal constraint is placed
   around the asteroid that guarantees collision avoidance while bounding
   control. In the second, landing phase, the spacecraft trajectory is
   maintained within a pyramid that tapers near the landing point while
   spacecraft speed is reduced as it approaches the surface. Simulations
   performed on the full nonlinear model with actual gravity parameters
   demonstrate successful landing using the proposed controller scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Presently, renewable power plants participating in electricity markets
   receive payments at a market price determined by the marginal cost of
   the marginal generator, generally a conventional power plant. In a
   market with only renewables, market clearing prices would be determined
   by the marginal cost of renewable power plants, which is generally close
   to zero, resulting in capital cost recovery problems for renewable power
   producers. Hence, in a market with only renewables, a new price-setting
   mechanism is needed which does not depend on marginal costs.
   In this paper, we analyze a model of such a mechanism for when all
   energy production is from renewable power plants such as wind and solar.
   We consider a mechanism in which producers bid single prices instead of
   supply functions. While such a price has no physical basis, it enables
   producers to recover sunk costs and parallels pricing in less regulated,
   lowmarginal cost industries like software and digital media.
   We do not advocate the adoption of this mechanism, but rather find it
   useful for understanding renewable-only markets because it is amenable
   to analysis of strategic behavior under uncertainty. Specifically, we
   analyze a game between two renewable producers with random capacities
   described by arbitrary probability distributions. The producers compete
   to fulfill a random demand. We find that symmetry (in terms of
   size/parameters) among producers and variance in producer capacities
   tend to increase competition. We demonstrate our results via several
   case studies.}},

Abstract = {{Resilient monitoring systems (RMS) are sensor networks that degrade
   gracefully under cyber-attacks on their sensors. The recently developed
   RMS, while being effective in the attacked sensors identification and
   isolation, exhibited a drawback in their operation - an exponentially
   increasing assessment time as a function of the number of sensors in the
   network. To combat this curse of dimensionality, a decomposition
   approach has been proposed, which led to a dramatic reduction of the
   assessment time, irrespective of the sensor network dimensionality.
   However, the information losses due to this approach, which involves
   decentralized inference calculations, have not been investigated. The
   current paper is intended to carry out such an investigation, and,
   specifically, derive a condition under which the inference calculations
   lead to no loss of information. The development is based on matrices,
   which characterize the coupling of process variables being monitored,
   and on the Renyi-2 entropy.}},

Abstract = {{Many challenges arise in evaluating predictions from dynamical models of
   physiological signals. A fundamental objective desired by clinicians is
   to predict regions of clinical interest rather than just match these
   signals. Although threshold based metrics provide much better insight by
   classifying predictions based on their ability to capture critical
   levels of abnormality, these metrics lack the ability to well
   characterize the prediction performance near decision boundaries. This
   paper presents a probabilistic approach for evaluating predictions by
   incorporating prediction uncertainty into the evaluation process. A case
   study is presented for evaluating 20s and 60s ahead predictions of
   critical oxygen levels in the blood using Gaussian Process (GP) models.
   Results show significant improvement in the ability to characterize the

Abstract = {{Ship propulsion shafts experience large power and torque fluctuations
   due to hydrodynamic interactions and wave excitation. The hybrid energy
   storage system (HESS) is an effective solution to address the impact of
   these fluctuations for all-electric ships. The new HESS introduced to
   combat the problem, however, will interact with the power generation and
   motor control systems, affecting both system efficiency and reliability.
   In our previous work {[}1], we proposed an energy management system
   (EMS) for HESS to incorporate information from other shipboard power
   units to manage the energy storage components and avoid undesirable
   interactions, especially those interactions between the batteries and
   ultra-capacitors. In this work, we pursue a more proactive approach to
   dealing with the interactions by designing an integrated EMS that
   encompasses the controls of power generators, electric propulsion motor,
   and HESS. Through model predictive control (MPC), such an integrated
   approach takes advantages of the predictive nature of MPC and allows us
   to judiciously coordinate the different entities of the shipboard power
   microgrid under constraints, thereby providing benefits in system
   performance. Results presented in this paper compare the proposed
   integrated EMS with non-integrated EMS to demonstrate its benefits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a technique for fault detection called
   sensor-to-sensor identification. Sensor-to-sensor identification takes
   advantage of freely available and unknown external (ambient) excitation
   to identify a sensor-to-sensor model (i.e., a transmissibility
   operator), which is independent of the excitation signal and the initial
   conditions of the underlying system. In the presence of unknown external
   excitation, the identified transmissibility operator is used to compute
   the sensor-to-sensor residual, which is the discrepancy between the
   predicted sensor output (based on the transmissibility operator) and the
   actual measurements. The sensor-to-sensor residuals are used to detect
   and diagnose faults in sensors and system dynamics. We consider an
   experimental setup consisting of a drum with two speakers and four
   microphones. Each speaker is an actuator, and each microphone is a
   sensor that measures the acoustic response at its location. Measurements
   from the four microphones are used to construct transmissibility
   operators, which in turn are used to detect changes in the dynamics of
   the drum by computing the resulting one-step residual.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a model predictive control (MPC) policy for
   simultaneous station keeping, attitude control, and momentum management
   of a nadir-pointing geostationary satellite equipped with three reaction
   wheels and four gimbaled electric thrusters that are located on the
   anti-nadir face of the satellite. The MPC policy works in combination
   with an innerloop SO (3)-based attitude controller that ensures the
   satellite maintains a nadir-pointing attitude. The MPC policy is able to
   maintain the satellite's position within a prescribed latitude and
   longitude window, while minimizing the Delta v required by the
   thrusters. The MPC policy also enforces thruster pointing constraints
   and manages the satellite's stored momentum. With reference to
   simulation results, we explain how the MPC is tuned for station keeping,
   the need for an inner-loop attitude controller, and how these separate
   systems work together to achieve all the controller's objectives.}},

   bandwidth for spacebased pointing systems via the application of mu-tip
   control, a passivity-based control methodology. First, the equations of
   motion of a pointing system are derived. Then, using a ``massive payload
   assumption{''} a passive input-output map is established between a
   modified output, called the mu-tip rate, and a modified control input.
   Bandwidth recovery is confirmed by investigating the frequency response
   of the linearized system. Simulation results that demonstrate the
   performance of the developed control algorithm are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The growing reliance of electric power systems on gas-fired generation
   to balance intermittent sources of renewable energy has increased the
   variation and volume of flows through natural gas transmission
   pipelines. Adapting pipeline operations to maintain efficiency and
   security under these new conditions requires optimization methods that
   account for transients and that can quickly compute solutions in
   reaction to generator re-dispatch. This paper presents an efficient
   scheme to minimize compression costs under dynamic conditions where
   deliveries to customers are described by time-dependent mass flow. The
   optimization scheme relies on a compact representation of gas flow
   physics, a trapezoidal discretization in time and space, and a two-stage
   approach to minimize energy costs and maximize smoothness. The resulting
   large-scale nonlinear programs are solved using a modern interior-point
   method. The proposed optimization scheme is validated against an
   integration of dynamic equations with adaptive time-stepping, as well as
   a recently proposed state-of- the-art optimal control method. The
   comparison shows that the solutions are feasible for the continuous
   problem and also practical from an operational standpoint. The results
   also indicate that our scheme scales to large gas transmission networks
   with more than 6000 kilometers of total pipeline.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-scale classification in form of object extraction or segmentation
   for high resolution SAR images is a challenging task due to the existing
   local noises, object deformation and part missing. A novel SAR
   classification method based on CRFs which combines low-level features,
   label context and object structure priors is presented in this paper.
   Local label pattern is proposed in this paper to model the object
   structures by measuring the local label configuration on the grid layer
   of SAR images. We build a new CRFs model with label context and object
   structure priors for image classification. Besides, we adopt Mean Field
   approximation for efficient inference of our CRFs model. This work
   intends to implement an efficient classification framework by
   integrating high-level label context and object priors and apply it to
   fine-scale object extraction of SAR images. The framework demonstrates
   good performance in both accuracy and efficiency for object extraction
   or segmentation of simulated images and high resolution SAR images.}},

Abstract = {{The distorted Born approximation (DBA) combined with the numerical
   solutions of Maxwell equations (NMM3D) has been used for the radar
   backscattering model for NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
   mission. The models for vegetated surfaces such as wheat, grass, soybean
   and corn have been validated with the Soil Moisture Active Passive
   Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) data. In this paper we report
   progress on development of a consistent model for combined active and
   passive microwave remote sensing of vegetated surfaces by using the same
   approach to obtain backscatter and emissivity. The active model
   DBA/NMM3D is extended to calculate bistatic scattering for each of the
   three scattering mechanisms: volume, double bounce and surface
   scattering. Then emissivity is obtained by integration of the bistatic
   scattering. An advantage of this combined active and passive model is
   that the same physical parameters of vegetation and soil surfaces are
   used in both the active model and the passive model. The beta parameter
   that relates backscattering to emissivity is also derived for various
   vegetated surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{In vegetated surface scattering, the physical values of optical
   thickness and scattering albedo both increase with frequency. At C-band,
   because of the attenuation due to large optical thickness, the distorted
   Born approximation gives negligible values for the surface scattering
   term and double bounce term. Because of the smallness of these two
   terms, the distorted Born approximation gives results independent of
   soil moisture. Physically, because the albedo is significant such as
   between 0.5 and 0.9, the radiative energy does not dissipate with the
   optical thickness, but go through multiple scattering within the
   vegetation layer. In this paper, we use vector radiative transfer theory
   to study the multiple scattering effects. We also study the transmission
   of the incident wave
   For rough surface scattering at C-band, due to increasing incoherent
   bistatic scattering from rough surface and the attenuation of coherent
   reflection, rough surface boundary condition will be applied to consider
   all scattered energy in rough surface scattering and the radiative
   energy interaction with the vegetation layer.}},

Abstract = {{The variational inversion for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind
   retrieval can take errors of all sources involved into account, but the
   complexity of ascertaining errors of wind vectors is high and the
   iteration process is very time-consuming. In this paper, we modify the
   decomposition of wind vectors into speed and direction, and adopt a
   damped Newton method (DNVAR) to solve the cost function, which is based
   on inexact line search condition. Experimental results show that DNVAR
   can effectively reduce background wind vector errors, and the average
   number of iterations for DNVAR descends greatly. For practical
   applications, when the background wind speed is higher than 10 m/s, the
   accuracy of DNVAR is higher than direct SAR wind retrieval (DIRECT),
   otherwise, DIRECT performs better.}},

Abstract = {{A recently developed microwave radiometric technique, known as wideband
   autocorrelation radiometry (WiBAR), offers a deterministic method to
   remotely sense the propagation time tau(dealy) of multi-path microwave
   emission of low-loss terrain covers and other layered surfaces.
   Terrestrial examples are the snow and lake ice packs. The microwave
   propagation time tau(delay) through the pack yields a measure of its
   vertical extent. We report measurements of the icepack on Lake Superior,
   and the snowpack at University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) in
   winter 2014 and 2015, respectively. The observations are done at
   frequencies from 7 to 10 GHz for icepack and 1 to 3 GHz for snowpack. At
   these frequencies, the volume and surface scattering are small in the
   packs. This technique is inherently low-power since there is no
   transmitter as opposed to active remote sensing techniques. In this
   paper the system design parameters of the WiBAR is discussed and it is
   shown that the microwave travel time within a dry snow pack and lake ice
   pack can be readily measured for a wide range of layer thicknesses
   observed during the experiment.}},

Abstract = {{There are a number of Big Data issues that are relevant for dealing with
   remotely-sensed data. The major ones are: Volume: How much data ( TB),
   Variety: How variable the organization and meaning of the data is,
   Velocity: Data coming in very fast (TB/sec), Variability: Data varying
   in format or composition over time.
   While each of these is being dealt with by a number of researchers and
   techniques, this paper concerns the second issue: Variety. Dealing with
   the variety of the data that results from remote sensing instruments is
   a daunting task, one that most analysts avoid by using one or a few
   well-known datasets. In order to tackle this problem head-on, we are
   developing an open-source software framework that enables the entire
   remote sensing community to contribute to the solution of this problem.
   In particular, the framework provides a set of standard tools for
   development of software that can then be used to ingest any format of
   remotely-sensed data. Once ingested, this data, including a standard set
   of metadata, can then be used in subsequent processing without writing
   sensor-specific processing codes.
   The framework tools that are being developed to accomplish this are
   detailed, along with some first successes in writing ``ingesters{''} for
   some of the popular datasets.}},

Abstract = {{We present a continuous-time output-feedback direct adaptive control
   method to deal with command following or disturbance rejection problem
   for systems that are possibly nonminimum phase and exponentially
   unstable. The adaptive control algorithm requires knowledge of the
   nonminimum-phase zeros of the transfer function from the control to the
   output. However, the knowledge of the characteristics or measurement of
   the reference command and disturbance is not required. The closed-loop
   stability is analyzed and the convergence of tracking error is proved
   under assumptions. The proposed adaptive control method is an extension
   of discrete-time retrospective cost adaptive control to continuous-time.
   Interpretation of retrospective cost adaptive control is provided, which
   is applicable for both discrete-time and continuous-time version.
   Numerical examples show that the proposed adaptive control method is
   effective for command following problem with unmeasured reference
   command and, in addition, robust to errors in the nonminimum-phase zero

Abstract = {{An agent that adopts a commitment to another agent should act so as to
   bring about a state of the world meeting the specifications of the
   commitment. Thus, by faithfully pursuing a commitment, an agent can be
   trusted to make sequential decisions that it believes can cause an
   intended state to arise. In general, though, an agent's actions will
   have uncertain outcomes, and thus reaching an intended state cannot be
   guaranteed. For such sequential decision settings with uncertainty,
   therefore, commitments can only be probabilistic. We propose a semantics
   for the trustworthy fulfillment of a probabilistic commitment that
   hinges on whether the agent followed a policy that would be expected to
   achieve an intended state with sufficient likelihood, rather than on
   whether the intended state was actually reached. We have developed and
   evaluated algorithms that provably operationalize this semantics, with
   different tradeoffs between responsiveness and computational overhead.
   We also discuss opportunities and challenges in extending our proposed
   semantics to richer forms of uncertainty, and to other agent
   architectures besides the decision-theoretic agents that have been our
   initial focus of study. Finally, we consider the implications of our
   semantics on how trust might be established and confirmed in open agent
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a wide dynamic range rectifier array
   using a novel adaptive power distribution method. In such a rectifier
   array, the RF input power is distributed among multiple rectifier
   devices adaptively, according to their impedances as a function of input
   power level. Such a rectifier array can achieve high rectification
   efficiency and low reflection coefficient over a wide range of power
   levels. The method is experimentally verified with a 900 MHz two-device
   rectifier array, and demonstrated an efficiency higher than 50\% over 17
   dB dynamic range (10 dB wider than a conventional rectifier design using
   the same devices) with a peak efficiency of 66\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents optimal design of switchable BST-on-Si composite
   film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs) for bulk acoustic wave (BAW)

   lateral wave spurious resonances that can significantly degrade the
   composite FBARs performance, are eliminated by designing a frame at the
   border of ferroelectric-on-Si FBARs. Using COMSOL simulations, a raised
   frame is designed at the border of BST-on-Si composite FBAR, which is
   dispersion type I resonator. Designed structure has been validated by
   fabrication and measurement and it is compared to typical composite FBAR

Abstract = {{Today, the Open Standard for Authorization (OAuth) is widely used by
   many service providers such as Google, Github, and Facebook. The
   OAuth-WebView implementation is the most widely used approach despite
   explicit warnings to the developers of its security and privacy risks.
   Previous researches have discussed these risks and proposed solutions
   that mandate numerous implementation's changes and/or do not assume
   strong attacking assumptions. In this work, we introduce SecureOAuth, a
   whitelist access control protection framework for the Android platform.
   SecureOAuth is composed of: Android library modifications, service
   creation, and system app creation. We have implemented a prototype of
   the SecureOAuth framework and evaluated it on performance and memory
   overhead. We also showcase examples of security threats that this
   framework counters. The framework hardens the OAuth-WebView
   implementation with bounded overhead while keeping the user's
   involvement to minimum. Moreover, the framework requires no
   implementations' changes and it assumes attackers with advanced and
   expert skill levels.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile applications have become an integral component of modern mobile
   operating systems. The usage pattern for these apps have increased
   tremendously the last ten years. At the same time, the security and
   privacy risks of these apps have also expanded in number and severity.
   In this paper, we spot the light on a critical component of Android
   mobile applications called Broadcast receivers. We focus on these
   receivers that are deliberately developed to listen to system's actions
   and events. The number of these actions has increased tremendously since
   the initial release of Android operating system. We showed that how such
   a component can pose serious privacy risks on users without their
   knowledge and awareness. We first illustrate a prototype of an attack
   that was possible due to the use of Broadcast receivers. We then show
   the results of analyzing a large dataset of malicious and benign Android
   applications in terms of their Broadcast receivers usages. Our prototype
   shows that with the use of Broadcast receivers the location privacy of
   users can be compromised, moreover, the dataset analysis results present
   that the usage of Broadcast receivers by malicious applications is
   remarkably higher than benign applications. Finally, we end with some
   conclusions and recommendations.}},

Journal = {{FISICA DE LA TIERRA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Pages = {{181-195}},
Abstract = {{In the last few years, water ice and perchlorate salts capable of
   melting this ice and producing liquid solutions have been discovered at
   the surface and shallow subsurface of Mars. In addition to via melting
   of ice, perchlorate salts may also form liquid solutions by absorbing
   water vapor when the relative humidity is above a certain threshold in a
   process known as deliquescence. Formed either by melting or
   deliquescence, liquid solutions (brine) are the most likely way of
   liquid water activity on the Martian surface and in the shallow
   subsurface and are therefore important to understand the habitability of
   Mars. Using Raman spectroscopy, we provide reference spectra of various
   mixing states of liquid water, water ice and calcium perchlorate, all of
   which can occur during brine formation. We focus on the perchlorate
   symmetric stretching band and the O-H stretching vibrational band to
   distinguish brine from crystalline salt and water ice. We show that
   perchlorate brines can be identified by analyzing the peaks and their
   widths in the decomposed Raman spectra of the investigated samples. This
   serves as an important reference for future in-situ Raman spectrometers
   on Mars, such as those on the ExoMars and Mars 2020 rovers and can aid
   in the detection of brine formation on Mars.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL FIRE ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{286-305}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to address a need for improving the structural
   resilience to multi-hazard threats including fire and progressive
   collapse caused by the loss of a column.
   Design/methodology/approach - The focus is on a steel moment frame that
   uses welded-unreinforced flange-bolted web connections between the beams
   and columns. A three-dimensional finite element (FE) model was created
   in ABAQUS with temperature-dependent properties for steel based on the
   Eurocode. The model was validated against experimental data at ambient
   and elevated temperature.
   Findings - The failure mechanisms in the FE model were consistent with
   experimental observations. Two scenarios were considered: fixed load
   with increasing temperature (i.e. simulating column failure prior to
   fire) and fixed temperature with increasing load (i.e. simulating column
   failure during fire).
   Originality/value - Amacro element (or component-based) model was also
   introduced and validated against the FE model and the experimental data,
   offering the possibility of analyzing large-scale structural systems
   with reasonable accuracy and improved computational efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Many electrode materials for lithium-ion battery applications are
   composed of secondary particles. Such an active material particle is not
   a solid particle, but consists of many fine primary particles. This work
   presents a coupled mechanical and electrochemical model to predict the
   intercalation-induced stress in a secondary particle with an agglomerate
   structure. In this model the electrochemical and transport processes are
   accounted for at both the secondary and primary particle levels. For
   mechanical analysis the secondary particle is treated as a continuum
   with stress calculated through lithium concentration and elastic
   deformation. With this model we revealed several important factors that
   affect stresses in secondary particles. Our simulations show that a
   stronger dependence of the open circuit potential of the active material
   on lithium-ion concentration reduces the stress level. A larger
   magnitude of over-potential at the surface of a secondary particle
   causes larger stresses. A larger primary particle size helps to reduce
   the stresses in the secondary particle as long as the secondary particle
   is a continuum containing many primary particles. Finally, a comparison
   between a porous secondary particle and a solid particle of the same
   size shows that the stress level in a porous secondary particle is much
   smaller. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A filtering method to reveal the crystallographic information present in
   Atom Probe Microscopy (APM) data is presented. The method filters atoms
   based on the time difference between their evaporation and the
   evaporation of the previous atom. Since this time difference correlates
   with the location and the local structure of the evaporating atoms on
   the surface, it can be used to reveal any crystallographic information
   contained within APM data. The demonstration of this method is
   illustrated on:
   A pure Al specimen for which crystallographic poles are clearly visible
   on the desorption patterns easily indexed.
   Three Fe-15at.\% Cr datasets where crystallographic patterns are less
   obvious and require this filtering method. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Product forms in quantitative design methods are typically expressed
   with a mathematical representation such as vectors, trees, graphs, and
   grammars. Such formal representations are restrictive in terms of
   realism or flexibility, and this limits their utility for human
   designers who typically create product forms in a design space that is
   restricted by the medium (e.g., free-hand sketching) and by their
   cognitive skills (e.g., creativity and experience). To increase the
   value of formal representations to human designers, this paper proposes
   to represent the design space as designs sampled from a statistical
   distribution of form and estimate a generative model of this
   distribution using a large set of images and design attributes of
   previous designs. This statistical representation approach is both
   flexible and realistic, and is estimated using a deep (multi-layer)
   generative model. The value of the representation is demonstrated in a
   study of two-dimensional automobile body forms. Using 180,000 form data
   of automobile designs over the past decade, we can morph a vehicle form
   into different body types and brands, thus offering human designers
   potential insights on realistic new design possibilities.}},

Abstract = {{As the frequency of supply chain disruptions rises, businesses are
   increasingly realizing the value of supply chain resilience. A number of
   efforts has been devoted to define supply chain resilience or to develop
   risk mitigation strategies in order to maximize supply chain resilience.
   However, very few scholarly work has attempted to address how supply
   chain resilience should be quantified. This paper is dedicated to fill
   this gap by proposing a general framework for evaluating supply chain
   resilience. The proposed framework captures risks involved in the
   supply, the demand, the firm itself, and the external environment. In
   addition to risks, the framework also relates resilience to the supply
   chain's risk prognosis capabilities, recover agility and recover time
   tolerance. Two example applications are used to demonstrate how this
   framework can be utilized to assess the effectiveness of risk mitigation
   strategies in supply chain design.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturers launch new product models at various time increments to
   meet changing market requirements over time. At each design period,
   product design and price may change. While price decisions can be made
   at product launching time, redesign decisions must be made in advance.
   Real options theory addresses such time gap decisions. This paper
   presents a real options approach with a binomial lattice model to
   determine optimal design and price decisions for hybrid electric
   vehicles (HEVs) that maximize expanded net present value of profit under
   gas price uncertainty over time. Results confirm that we can obtain
   changing vehicle attributes by changing gear ratios rather than the
   architectures themselves due to high cost of redesigning. A parametric
   study examines the impact of gas price volatility on option decisions
   and shows that larger volatility of gas price causes the change option
   to be selected more frequently.}},

Abstract = {{Development of morphing systems is a fast evolving area of research with
   broad applications, including morphing aircraft. Classified based on the
   magnitude of the motion, there are generally two scales of morphing:
   local (small scale; e.g. airfoil morphing), and global (large scale;
   e.g. wing morphing), both requiring adaptive structures to provide
   morphing motion while maintaining structural rigidity. In this paper, a
   new design is presented for local morphing, inspired by the notion of
   minimal actuation effort. Based on the concept of multi-loop linkages,
   this design allows a morphing curve, represented by a series of points,
   to take up three distinct shapes, with a single actuation input. The
   underlying design is based on a network of four-bar linkages connected
   together to form a multi-loop linkage, referred to as the Curve Adaptive
   Linkage Array (CALA). A three-step method is developed and presented
   here to find the geometric dimensions of the CALA. Furthermore, a
   case-study for an airfoil morphing application is presented and solved
   using the proposed method. The presented method provides a means to
   reduce the number of actuators needed for shape morphing, and is
   generally applicable to any shape morphing application.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient methodology to predict the nonlinear response of bladed
   disks with a diy friction ring damper is proposed. Designing frictional
   interfaces for bladed disk systems is an important approach to dissipate
   vibration energy. One emerging technology uses ring dampers, which are
   ring-like substructures constrained to move inside a groove at the root
   of the blades. Such rings are in contact with the bladed disk due to
   centrifugal forces, and they create nonlinear dissipation by relative
   motion between the ring and the disk. The analysis of the dynamic
   response of nonlinear structures is commonly done by numerical
   integration of the equations of motion, which is computationally
   inefficient, especially for steady-state responses. To address this
   issue, reduced order models (ROMs) are developed to capture the
   nonlinear behavior due to contact friction. The approach is based on
   expressing the nonlinear forces as equivalent nonlinear damping and
   stiffness parameters. The method requires only sector level calculation,
   and allows pre-calculation of the response-dependent equivalent terms.
   These factors contribute to the increase of the computational speed of
   the iterative solution method. A model of a bladed disk and damper; is
   used to demonstrate the method. Macro- and micro-slip are used in the
   friction model to account for realistic behavior of dry friction
   damping. For validation, responses due to steady-state traveling wave
   excitations are examined. Results computed by ROMs are compared with
   results from transient dynamic analysis in ANSYS with the full order
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Feature learning has become popular in robotics due to recent advances
   in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method to utilize
   the high-dimensional features from these techniques as observations in
   Bayesian estimation problems in a real-time manner. We develop an
   approach that: 1) pre-processes the observations and maps them into a
   new space with both reduced dimensions and a linear relationship to the
   estimation states; and 2) estimates the uncertainty of resulting outputs
   using data perturbation. The result is that deep learning approaches can
   be combined with more traditional filtering approaches like the Kalman
   filter (KF) to achieve state-of-the-art real-time performance. We
   validate the method by presenting the first real-time application of
   underwater robot localization using an imaging sonar. The proposed
   technique shows similar localization accuracy to benchmark approaches

Abstract = {{Many autonomous vehicles require precise localization into a prior map
   in order to support planning and to leverage semantic information within
   those maps (e.g. that the right lane is a turn-only lane.) A popular
   approach in automotive systems is to use infrared intensity maps of the
   ground surface to localize, making them susceptible to failures when the
   surface is obscured by snow or when the road is repainted. An emerging
   alternative is to localize based on the 3D structure around the vehicle;
   these methods are robust to these types of changes, but the maps are
   costly both in terms of storage and the computational cost of matching.
   In this paper, we propose a fast method for localizing based on 3D
   structure around the vehicle using a 2D representation. This
   representation retains many of the advantages of ``full{''} matching in
   3D, but comes with dramatically lower space and computational
   requirements. We also introduce a variation of Graph-SLAM tailored to
   support localization, allowing us to make use of graph-based
   error-recovery techniques in our localization estimate. Finally, we
   present real-world localization results for both an indoor mobile
   robotic platform and an autonomous golf cart, demonstrating that
   autonomous vehicles do not need full 3D matching to accurately localize
   in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving real-time perception is critical to developing a fully
   autonomous system that can sense, navigate, and interact with its
   environment. Perception tasks such as online 3D reconstruction and
   mapping have been intensely studied for terrestrial robotics
   applications. However, characteristics of the underwater domain such as
   light attenuation and light scattering violate the brightness constancy
   constraint, which is an underlying assumption in methods developed for
   land based applications. Furthermore, the complex nature of light
   propagation underwater limits or even prevents subsea use of real-time
   depth sensors used in state-of-the-art terrestrial mapping techniques.
   There have been recent advances in the development of plenoptic (also
   known as light field) cameras, which use an array of micro lenses
   capturing both intensity and ray direction to enable color and depth
   measurement from a single passive sensor. This paper presents an
   end-to-end system to harness these cameras to produce real-time 3D
   reconstructions underwater. Our system builds upon the state-of-the-art
   in online terrestrial 3D reconstruction, transferring these approaches
   to the underwater domain by gathering real-time color and depth (RGB-D)
   data underwater using a plenoptic camera, and performing dense 3D
   reconstruction while compensating for attenuation effects of the
   underwater environment simultaneously, using a graphics processing unit
   (GPU) to achieve real-time performance. Results are presented for data
   gathered in a water tank and the proposed technique is validated
   quantitatively through comparison with a ground truth 3D model gathered
   in air to demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate accurate
   3D models of objects underwater in real-time.}},

   creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that allows the robot to
   classify LIDAR sensor data accordingly. In particular, we propose a CNN
   architecture that performs comparably or better than existing methods

Abstract = {{Matching 3D point clouds, a critical operation in map building and
   localization, is difficult with Velodyne-type sensors due to the sparse
   and non-uniform point clouds that they produce. Standard methods from
   dense 3D point clouds are generally not effective. In this paper, we
   describe a featurebased approach using Principal Components Analysis
   (PCA) of neighborhoods of points, which results in mathematically
   principled line and plane features. The key contribution in this work is
   to show how this type of feature extraction can be done efficiently and
   robustly even on non-uniformly sampled point clouds. The resulting
   detector runs in real-time and can be easily tuned to have a low false
   positive rate, simplifying data association. We evaluate the performance
   of our algorithm on an autonomous car at the MCity Test Facility using a
   Velodyne HDL-32E, and we compare our results against the state-of-theart

   robustness to false positives inherent to the coding system. The new

Abstract = {{Bellows-like actuators are popular in soft robotic systems. Sensing the
   movement of these actuators with traditional sensors is challenging.
   This work proposes and tests a sensing system based on the changing
   mutual inductance of wire coils on bellows. A method for modeling the
   changes in mutual inductance between coils of tightly-packed wires is
   introduced. Changes in mutual inductance are measured through the
   self-inductance of a circuit made up of the coils in series. The
   self-inductance of the circuit measures the bellows bend-angle. The
   experiments show an approximately quadratic relationship between the
   bend angle and the measured inductance. From a bend angle of 121 degrees
   to -67 degrees the inductance of the circuit increases by 19 \%. The
   bias-inducing effects of shear strain, torsional strain, non-uniform
   bending, and nearby metal are also explored.}},

Abstract = {{A new experimental method was developed which isolated charge
   composition effects for wide levels of internal EGR (iEGR) at constant
   total EGR (tEGR) for negative valve overlap (NVO) homogeneous charge
   compression ignition (HCCI) combustion. Using this method, the effect of
   changing iEGR was examined for both research grade gasoline (RON = 90.5)
   and PRF40 across multiple engine speeds and at constant charge
   composition. For this study, the charge composition was defined as the
   total mass of fresh air, fuel and tEGR. Comparison also was made between
   the two fuels at a fixed iEGR level to isolate, independent of
   compositional effects, the effect of a low octane fuel on HCCI burn
   rates.
   From the experimental, results, for all engine speeds, for a given iEGR
   level, PRF40 was found to have a reduced burn duration and higher
   maximum heat release rate (HRR) compared with gasoline. PRF40 was found
   to have a nearly constant burn duration and HRR for a given load and
   CA50, largely independent of engine speed and iEGR level. Gasoline, for
   equivalent conditions, showed an increased burn duration at higher iEGR
   levels.
   When comparing PRF40 to gasoline at fixed speed, combustion phasing and
   iEGR level, the increase in HRR was found to coincide with reduced
   intake valve closing (IVC) temperatures necessary to maintain constant
   combustion phasing for the PRF40. The reduced IVC temperature for PRF40
   reduced the thermal stratification in-cylinder compared with gasoline
   and may have been the cause of this change. To examine the impact of
   thermal gradients relative to fuel chemistry, a multi-zone ``balloon
   model{''} was used to evaluate experimental conditions. The model used a
   reduced chemical kinetic mechanism for PRFs with PRF87 representing
   gasoline. The results of the model demonstrated that when the
   in-cylinder temperature profiles between PRF40 and PRF87 were matched by
   adjusting wall temperature, the heat release rates were nearly
   identical. This result suggested the observed differences in burn rates
   between gasoline and PRF40 were influenced to a large degree by
   differences in thermal stratification, and to a lesser extent by
   differences in fuel chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Diluting Spark-Ignited (SI) stoichiometric combustion engines with
   excess residual gas improves thermal efficiency, and allows spark to be
   advanced towards Maximum Brake Torque (MBT) timing. However, flame
   propagation rates decrease and misfires can occur at high Exhaust Gas
   Recirculation (EGR) conditions and advanced spark, limiting the maximum
   level of charge dilution and its benefits.
   The misfire limits are often determined for a specific engine from
   extensive experiments covering a large range of speed, torque and
   actuator settings. To extend the benefits of dilute combustion while at
   the misfire limit, it is essential to define a parameterizable,
   physics-based model capable of predicting the misfire limits, with cycle
   to cycle varied flame burning velocity as operating conditions change
   based on driver demand. A cycle averaged model is the first step in this
   process.
   The current work describes a model of cycle averaged laminar flame
   burning velocity within the early flame development period of 0 to 3
   percent mass fraction burned. A flame curvature correction method is
   used to account for both the effect of flame stretch and ignition.

Abstract = {{The design and control of hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) powertrains
   presents an optimization problem to balance the trade-off between
   multiple objectives, such as fuel economy, drivability, and emissions.
   However, current design methodologies do not simultaneously incorporate
   all of these three considerations into both the sizing and control
   layers of the optimization problem. This paper first demonstrates that
   the trade-offs between these objectives can be non-trivial in the HEV
   control problem. This motivates the need for a systematic design
   procedure that can take all three objectives into account. To address
   this need, the paper describes the development of a new and efficient
   design framework called the Hybrid-Vehicle Design Tool (HVDT), which
   adopts a bi-level optimization strategy. Efficiency is achieved by
   introducing a neural-network-based meta model to predict the performance
   of the optimal control strategy obtained using Dynamic Programming (DP).
   To demonstrate the HVDT, a small HEV is designed for the UDDS and HWFET
   driving cycles separately. Results show that the optimized design can
   reduce fuel consumption, improve emissions and improve drivability when
   compared to the nominal design obtained using first principle design
   methodologies. Additionally, compared to using DP directly in the
   bi-level optimization, using the meta-model reduces the simulation from
   238 to 16 days (93\%) and from 132 to 16 days (88\%) for the UDDS and
   HWFET cycles, respectively, with an acceptable compromise in the
   accuracy of predicting the performance of DP.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteriophage T4 is one of the most common and complex of the tailed
   viruses that infect host bacteria using an intriguing contractile tail
   assembly. Despite extensive progress in resolving the structure of T4,
   the dynamics of the injection machinery remains largely unknown. This
   paper contributes a first model of the injection machinery that is
   driven by elastic energy stored in a structure known as the sheath. The
   sheath is composed of helical strands of protein that suddenly collapse
   from an energetic, extended conformation prior to infection to a
   relaxed, contracted conformation during infection. We employ Kirchhoff
   rod theory to simulate the nonlinear dynamics of a single protein strand
   coupled to a model for the remainder of the virus, including the coupled
   translation and rotation of the head (capsid), neck and tail tube. Doing
   so provides an important building block towards the future goal of
   modeling the entire sheath structure which is composed of six
   interacting helical protein strands. The resulting numerical model
   exposes fundamental features of the injection machinery including the
   time scale and energetics of the infection process, the nonlinear
   conformational change experienced by the sheath, and the contribution of
   hydrodynamic drag on the head (capsid).}},

Abstract = {{A multiple-mode dynamic model is developed for a
   piezoelectrically-actuated micro-robot with multiple legs. The motion of
   the micro robot results from dual direction motion of piezoelectric
   actuators in the legs, while the complexity of micro robot locomotion is
   increased by impact dynamics. The dynamic model is developed to describe
   and predict the micro robot motion, in the presence of asymmetrical
   behavior due to non-ideal fabrication and variable properties of the
   underlying terrain. The dynamic model considers each robot leg as a
   continuous structure moving in two directions derived from beam theory
   with specific boundary condition. Robot body motion is modeled in six
   degrees of freedom using a rigid body approximation. Individual modes of
   the resulting multi mode robot are treated as second order linear
   systems. The dynamic model is tested with a meso-scale robot prototype
   having a similar actuation scheme as micro-robots. In accounting for the
   interaction between robot and ground, the dynamic model with first two
   modes of each leg shows good match with experimental results for the
   mesoscale prototype, in terms of both magnitude and the trends of robot
   locomotion with respect to actuation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Teleoperated unmanned ground vehicles are very useful in environments
   that are hazardous for humans. When controlled manually, speed of
   operation can be very slow due to degraded and delayed feedback of
   information to/from the vehicle's environment. Adding autonomy to the
   vehicle can make control for the human teleoperator easier and improve
   performance. This paper presents a semi-autonomous control method for
   avoiding collisions while driving a vehicle. The method is well suited
   for small unmanned ground vehicles in unstructured environments (i.e.
   environments without predefined roads/paths to follow). The
   semi-autonomous control method and the effect of communication latency
   are evaluated with a human subject study (N=20) involving teleoperation
   of a simulated robot search task. Results show that while semi-autonomy
   does improve performance at low communication latency, the improvement
   is much larger at higher latencies.}},

Abstract = {{The remarkable energetic versatility and adaptability of skeletal muscle
   provides great inspiration to develop advanced adaptive structures and
   materials. These notable properties may arise from the assembly of
   skeletal muscle's nanoscale cross bridges into microscale structures
   known as sarcomeres. Essential understanding of muscle energetics has
   been developed from models of the micro/nanoscale constituents which
   incorporate an intriguing, asymmetric, bistable potential energy
   landscape to capture trends in the experimental data on cross-bridge
   power stroke motions. Inspired by the capability of cross-bridges to
   strategically absorb and store elastic energy for achieving high
   energetic efficiency of sudden motions, this research studies the
   assembly of modular mechanical structures from asymmetrically bistable
   constituents to absorb and trap energy in higher-energy stable
   configurations. Specifically, energy features of a module with an
   asymmetrically bistable element are first studied; these modules are
   then assembled in series and parallel to generate structures with
   multiple stable configurations having different quantities of stored
   energy. Dynamic analyses are performed to illustrate the ability of
   these structures to trap a portion of the kinetic energy due to an
   impulsive excitation as recoverable and reusable strain energy, and
   insight is gained into how asymmetries and damping influence the energy
   trapping performance.}},

Abstract = {{We report metagenomic evidence for the presence of a Nitrospira-like
   organism with the metabolic potential to perform the complete oxidation
   of ammonia to nitrate (i.e., it is a complete ammonia oxidizer
   {[}comammox]) in a drinking water system. This metagenome bin was
   discovered through shotgun DNA sequencing of samples from biologically
   active filters at the drinking water treatment plant in Ann Arbor, MI.
   Ribosomal proteins, 16S rRNA, and nxrA gene analyses confirmed that this
   genome is related to Nitrospira-like nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. The
   presence of the full suite of ammonia oxidation genes, including ammonia
   monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase, on a single ungapped
   scaffold within this metagenome bin suggests the presence of recently
   discovered comammox potential. Evaluations based on coverage and k-mer
   frequency distribution, use of two different genome-binning approaches,
   and nucleic acid and protein similarity analyses support the presence of
   this scaffold within the Nitrospira metagenome bin. The amoA gene found
   in this metagenome bin is divergent from those of canonical ammonia and
   methane oxidizers and clusters closely with the unusual amoA gene of
   comammox Nitrospira. This finding suggests that previously reported
   imbalances in abundances of nitrite-and ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria/archaea may likely be explained by the capacity of
   Nitrospira-like organisms to completely oxidize ammonia. This finding
   might have significant implications for our understanding of microbially
   mediated nitrogen transformations in engineered and natural systems.
   IMPORTANCE Nitrification plays an important role in regulating the
   concentrations of inorganic nitrogen species in a range of environments,
   from drinking water and wastewater treatment plants to the oceans. Until
   recently, aerobic nitrification was considered to be a two-step process
   involving ammonia-oxidizing bacteria or archaea and nitrite-oxidizing
   bacteria. This process requires close cooperation between these two
   functional guilds for complete conversion of ammonia to nitrate, without
   the accumulation of nitrite or other intermediates, such as nitrous
   oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. The discovery of a single organism with
   the potential to oxidize both ammonia and nitrite adds a new dimension
   to the current understanding of aerobic nitrification, while presenting
   opportunities to rethink nitrogen management in engineered systems.}},

Abstract = {{In recent months, a new passive metamaterial-inspired vibration
   suppression method has been defined and investigated. This system is
   called a metastructure and is a design consisting of multiple
   oscillators that absorb vibration from the host structure.
   Metastructures integrate vibration suppression into the initial design,
   saving time and other resources that are often spent on adding
   structural damping after manufacturing. Previous metastructure designs
   have proved to be effective in vibration suppression and recent research
   has focused on optimization. Due to the high amount of inherent material
   damping that many of these structures incorporate, these optimizations
   may be gaining some of their advantages from material damping instead of
   solely from the design. This research focuses on finding the dividing
   line between effectiveness of absorber design and the damping properties
   of chosen materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a substructuring approach is developed for coupling two
   generic linear structures. It is demonstrated that, starting from the
   classical Craig-Bampton method, the size of the reduced order model of
   each substructure can be further reduced by using the so called
   Characteristic Constraint Modes (CCMs), describing the characteristic
   motion of the substructure interfaces. Moreover, when two substructures
   have to be coupled, a suitable common basis of CCMs can be defined,
   making their coupling possible. The assembly of the substructures is
   enabled by exploiting the shape functions of the interface elements. The
   proposed method is particularly advantageous when the meshes at the
   interfaces are non-conforming.}},

Abstract = {{Current aircraft turbo-engines consist of multi-stage rotating bladed
   disks whose design depends on the linear finite element analysis of each
   of their components. Predicting the dynamics of the whole engine is
   computationally costly since the dynamic coupling of many components has
   to be considered. This paper presents a novel methodology used to obtain
   a multi-stage reduced order model when two or more cyclic symmetric
   stages have to be assembled. It is shown how the starting Craig-Bampton
   models of the stages are further reduced by approximating the motion at
   the inter-stage boundaries with a basis of harmonic functions. The
   multi-stage reduced model can be obtained when a suitable basis of
   harmonic functions for the two stages is found. The proposed method is
   particularly advantageous when the stages have a different number of
   sectors that lead to non-matching meshes at the inter-stage boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic analysis of structures with localized nonlinearities, such
   as friction contacts is a computationally demanding task because of the
   large size of the models involved. Therefore, high-resolution finite
   element models are often reduced using a variety of specialized
   techniques which exploit spatial coherences in the dynamics. In this
   paper the spatial coherences are represented with a set of modes coming
   from the Jacobian of partial derivatives of contact forces with respect
   to displacements representing specifically chosen boundary conditions at
   the contacts over one cycle of vibration. The technique is effective in
   the reduction of models studied using multiple harmonics with a coupled
   static solution.
   Furthermore, a novel method to evaluate the quality of the reduced-order
   solution not involving the comparison with the full-order solution is
   introduced and validated.}},

Abstract = {{The Carbon and Oxygen ionization states in the solar wind plasma
   freeze-in within 2 solar radii (Rs) from the solar surface, and then
   they do not change as they propagate with the solar wind into the
   heliosphere. Therefore, the O7+/O6+ and C6+/C5+ charge state ratios
   measured in situ maintain a record of the thermal properties (electron
   temperature and density) of the inner corona where the solar wind
   originates. Since these two ratios freeze-in at very similar height,
   they are expected to be correlated. However, an investigation of the
   correlation between these two ratios as measured by ACE/SWICS instrument
   from 1998 to 2011 shows that there is a subset of ``Outliers{''}
   departing from the expected correlation. We find about 49.4\% of these
   Outliers is related to the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections
   (ICMEs), while 49.6\% of them is slow speed wind (V-p <500 km/s) and
   about 1.0\% of them is fast solar wind (V-p > 500 km/s). We compare the
   outlier-slow-speed wind with the normal slow wind (defined as V-p <500
   km/s and O7+/O6+ > 0.2) and find that the reason that causes the
   Outliers to depart from the correlation is their extremely depleted
   C6+/C5+ ratio which is decreased by 80\% compared to the normal slow
   wind. We discuss the implication of the Outlier solar wind for the solar
   wind acceleration mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the two-hour resolution solar wind proton speed (V-p) and
   charge state ratio of O7+/O6+ measured by ACE (SWICS and SWEPAM) from
   1998 to 2011 at 1 AU. By applying a two-step mapping method, we link the
   solar wind in-situ observations to the corona images captured by SOHO
   and STEREO, in which we identify the different plasma structures, such
   as active regions (ARs), coronal holes (CHs) and quiet Sun regions (QS),
   using a classification scheme based on pixel brightness. Then we
   determine from which region in the corona the solar wind originates. We
   examine the in-situ properties of the solar wind streams associated with
   CHs, ARs and QS regions. We find that more than half of CH associated
   wind is actually slow wind, and O7+/O6+ ratio has a strong coherent
   correlation with the location of the solar wind coronal sources.
   Therefore, we conclude that O7+/O6+ ratio can be used as a much more
   effective discriminator to identify solar wind coronal sources region
   than Vp.}},

   system. Comparisons were made using a stationary tractor PTO dynamometer
   and by performing field operations. The dynamometer tests revealed that
   the power output of the T7060 was significantly higher (5\%) for canola
   SVO when compared to diesel due to the Elsbett system, which increased
   the common rail fuel pressure. This increase resulted in significantly
   higher (4.07\%) SVO fuel consumption for power production levels above
   115 kW compared to diesel fuel. In the field, however, it was found that
   SVO fuel consumption was not significantly different from diesel for the
   two operations tested: planting soybeans and mowing alfalfa.}},

Abstract = {{Recently developed motorized lower limb prostheses which provide joint
   power at the knee and/or ankle have been shown to assist users in
   performing a variety of ambulation tasks. Control of these devices,
   specifically creating seamless, natural, and accurate mode transitions,
   is challenging. The control system also needs to allow users the
   flexibility to perform these tasks with a wide range of variability. The
   goal of this study was to develop and test a flexible control system for
   a powered knee-ankle prosthesis. Specifically, a pattern recognition
   system was trained to recognize the transitions between six modes
   (standing, level-ground walking, ramp ascent, ramp descent, stair
   ascent, and stair descent) at various discrete time points during the
   gait cycle. Six transfemoral users were successful performing a variety
   of ambulation tasks including climbing a 3- and 4-step staircases,
   performing walking and standing transitions to and from the staircases,
   approaching the stairs and ramps at various angles, and ambulating at
   various speeds. Offline classification results demonstrate that system
   error rates 1.6\% {[}1.0\%], mean {[}standard deviation], at heel
   contact and 0.5\% {[}0.2\%] at toe off. The results of this study are
   encouraging and provide another step towards a clinically viable lower
   limb intent recognition system for a powered knee-ankle prosthesis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explore the phase velocity dispersion of Lamb wave in
   gallium nitride (GaN) thin film. For this study, ultra-high-frequency
   (UHF) GaN micromechanical resonators with various electrode pitch
   distances are designed as test vehicles. Fabricated by a process
   compatible with commercial monolithic microwave integrated circuit
   (MMIC) technology, our GaN resonators demonstrate promising performance
   (e. g. high quality factor of 1200 at 1GHz) and can be monolithically
   integrated with active (i.e. HEMTs) devices in an all-GaN platform. The
   zeroorder symmetric (S0) and antisymmetric (A0) Lamb wave modes are
   observed in our measurements. The experimentally extracted phase
   velocity dispersion relations of GaN for both S0 and A0 modes are in
   good agreement with the theoretical data. Out results indicate that S0
   mode is a better choice than A0 mode for high frequency GaN Lamb wave
   resonators because of its high phase velocity and low dispersion
   characteristics.}},

   image processing and imaging. Recent research has shown the usefulness
   of sparsity or low-rank techniques for solving inverse problems such as
   those in dynamic imaging. In particular, the imaged temporal data
   sequence is modeled as a sum of low-rank and sparse components that are
   estimated from measurements. In this work, we instead decompose the
   temporal image sequence into a low-rank component and a component whose
   spatiotemporal patches are assumed sparse in some adaptive dictionary
   domain. We present a methodology to jointly estimate the underlying
   signal components and the spatiotemporal dictionary from highly
   under-sampled measurements. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the
   promising performance of our scheme for dynamic magnetic resonance image
   reconstruction from undersampled k-t space data}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in computed tomography (CT) is to reduce X-ray dose to
   a low or even ultra-low level while maintaining the high quality of
   reconstructed images. We propose a new method for CT reconstruction that
   combines penalized weighted-least squares reconstruction (PWLS) with
   regularization based on a sparsifying transform (PWLS-ST) learned from a
   dataset of numerous CT images. We adopt an alternating algorithm to
   optimize the PWLS-ST cost function that alternates between a CT image
   update step and a sparse coding step. We adopt a relaxed linearized
   augmented Lagrangian method with ordered-subsets (relaxed OS-LALM) to
   accelerate the CT image update step by reducing the number of forward
   and backward projections. Numerical experiments on the XCAT phantom show
   that for low dose levels, the proposed PWLS-ST method dramatically
   improves the quality of reconstructed images compared to PWLS
   reconstruction with a nonadaptive edge-preserving regularizer (PWLS-EP).}},

Abstract = {{An essential function for automated vehicle technologies is accurate
   localization. It is difficult, however, to achieve lane-level accuracy
   with low-cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers due to
   the biased noisy pseudo-range measurements. Approaches such as
   Differential GNSS can improve the accuracy, but usually require an
   enormous amount of investment in base stations. The emerging connected
   vehicle technologies provide an alternative approach to improving the
   localization accuracy. It has been shown in this paper that localization
   accuracy can be enhanced by fusing GNSS information within a group of
   connected vehicles and matching the configuration of the group to a
   digital map to eliminate the common bias in localization. A
   Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) was used to jointly estimate
   the common biases of the pseudo-ranges and the vehicles positions.
   Multipath biases, which are non-common to vehicles, were mitigated by a
   multi-hypothesis detection-rejection approach. The temporal correlation
   was exploited through the prediction-update process. The proposed
   approach was compared to the existing static and smoothed static methods
   in the intersection scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed
   algorithm reduced the estimation error by fifty percent and reduced the
   estimation variance by two orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The role of entrepreneurship in engineering education has undergone a
   substantial transformation over the last several years. Engineering
   entrepreneurship has evolved from the traditional business school model,
   focusing on business skills and business plans, to include cultivating
   an entrepreneurial mindset to enhance engineers' professional formation.
   Engineering programs arc incorporating entrepreneurship into both formal
   and informal learning through the integration of formal courses, pitch
   competitions, mentorship, start-up weekends, and maker-spaces into
   student offerings. While it is becoming generally accepted that
   entrepreneurship education requires active student learning pedagogics,
   assessment of student learning in relation to these pedagogics is still
   evolving. Of the few existing engineering entrepreneurship assessments,
   most have broadly assessed students' perceptions of business skills and
   knowledge, self-efficacy, attitude towards entrepreneurship, and
   entrepreneurial intent. However, with the considerable amount of
   variance in course content and instruction, further comparative research
   in controlled entrepreneurship education environments is needed to
   accurately assess student outcomes. The recent widespread adoption of
   the Lean LaunchPad Curriculum and Business Model Canvas has recently
   provided engineering programs with straightforward, common curriculum
   and pedagogical approaches, as well as an opportunity for targeted
   assessment across institutions. Prior to the Lean LaunchPad curriculum,
   there was no consensus on introductory entrepreneurship content and
   delivery for non-business students. The purpose of this study is to
   examine the impact of the Lean LaunchPad curriculum and pedagogy on
   undergraduate students with regard to self-efficacy, behavior, and know
   ledge. In this study, entrepreneurial self-efficacy was measured using a
   validated survey from existing entrepreneurship research. Additionally,
   a validated entrepreneurial behavior inventory was used to assess
   entrepreneurial behavior, as opposed to measuring behavioral traits and
   attitudes. To examine entrepreneurial knowledge, students were asked to
   complete open-ended survey questions to determine how they would pursue
   a new venture at different stages of development. The preliminary
   results of these surveys are discussed in this paper in an effort to
   better understand the impact of the Lean LaunchPad Curriculum on student
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{This work-in-progress paper describes the entrepreneurial approach used
   to structure a two-semester product design capstone course in chemical
   engineering. Historically, the course instructors defined the products
   that the student teams could create, and thus they were only tasked with
   developing the assigned product and were not involved in the problem
   identification and opportunity exploration processes. Some student
   commentary on course evaluations expressed desire for more freedom and
   creativity in this process. Therefore, this updated offering of the
   course did not assign specific projects and instead required the student
   teams to develop and pitch a unique product idea, using techniques
   within entrepreneurial communication. Class activities also further
   emphasized entrepreneurial skills such as creativity, innovation, and
   project and conflict management. Student commentary on the mid-semester
   course evaluations and anecdotally, the entrepreneurial approach has
   been positively received, and the students seem genuinely excited about
   their project topics. At the end of the course in April 2016, the
   instructors will review the student course evaluations and weekly
   student reflections. We anticipate the entrepreneurship component will
   affect how the students approach and value the projects.}},

Abstract = {{A dual-stage, ultra-low power (ULP) acoustic event detection (AED)

   diversion (LTSD). The dual stage approach achieves ultra-low power
   consumption without significantly degrading system performance. A

   performance evaluation is provided in details. The proposed system can
   achieve >95\% detection rate with 0.2\% false alarm rate for voice

   for inference and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The
   processor incorporates sparse convolvers to realize

   parallelized along a non-sparse dimension to minimize stalling. At 0.9V
   and 240MHz, the processor achieves an effective 898.2GOPS performance,
   dissipating 140.9mW. Using sparsity, we reduce the workload, datapath

Abstract = {{This research improves upon prior research efforts on the hydrothermal
   synthesis of barium titanate (BaTiO3) films. It has been established
   that BaTiO3 can be synthesized using a two-step hydrothermal reaction
   that first synthesizes TiO2 then converts it to BaTiO3. Past research,
   however, resulted in relatively low ferroelectric properties using this
   technique. The research addresses that shortcoming by offering an
   optimized hydrothermal synthesis process that significantly increase the
   electromechanical coupling of the BaTiO3 film. Here, it is shown that
   the d(33) achieves a value of 80 pm/V, which is the bulk BaTiO3 value.
   Additionally, this optimization results in an enhanced dielectric
   constant of 1600. Therefore, this research reveals that the
   ferroelectric properties of a hydrothermally synthesized BaTiO3 film can
   be significantly enhanced through slight modifications in the
   hydrothermal processing procedure.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a fabrication process for the conformal growth of

   films on nonplanar architectures while utilizing relatively low
   synthesis temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to
   show the controllable conversion of TiO2 nanowires to BaTiO3 films and
   x-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to validate the crystal structures.
   Tested by a refined piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) method, the
   conformal films exhibited a piezoelectric coupling coefficient as high
   as 100 pm/V. With superior piezoelectric properties and the capability
   to grow on design specific surfaces, the BaTiO3 conformal films

Abstract = {{Accurately predicting the onset of large behavioral deviations
   associated with saddle-node bifurcations is imperative in a broad range
   of sciences and for a wide variety of purposes, including ecological
   assessment, signal amplification, and adaptive material/structure
   applications such as structural health monitoring and piezoelectric
   energy harvesting. In many such practices, noise and non-stationarity
   are unavoidable and ever-present influences. As a result, it is critical
   to simultaneously account for these two factors towards the estimation
   of parameters that may induce sudden bifurcations. Here, a new
   analytical formulation is presented to accurately determine the probable
   time at which a system undergoes an escape event as governing parameters
   are swept towards a saddle-node bifurcation point in the presence of
   noise. The double-well Duffmg oscillator serves as the archetype system
   of interest since it possesses a dynamic saddle-node bifurcation. Using
   this archetype example, the stochastic normal form of the saddle-node
   bifurcation is derived from which expressions of the escape statistics
   are formulated. Non-stationarity is accounted for using a time dependent
   bifurcation parameter in the stochastic normal form. Then, the mean
   escape time is approximated from the probability density function to
   yield a straightforward means to estimate the point of bifurcation.
   Experiments conducted using a double-well Duffing analog circuit verify
   that the analytical approximations provide faithful estimation of the
   critical parameters that lead to the non-stationary and noise-activated
   saddle-node bifurcation.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to investigate how bio-inspired morphing wings built with
   state-of-the-art materials affect the aerodynamics and extend the range
   of flight conditions. In particular, this study investigates the
   aerodynamic effects of coupled airfoil and planform sweep morphing. The
   morphed geometries were chosen to resemble a current morphing design
   that uses Macro Fiber Composites (MFCs) and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA)
   wires. The primary mode of camber actuation is achieved using the MFCs
   which are supplemented using antagonistic SMA wires, forming a hinge
   ahead of the MFCs. The SMA hinge also allows for bi-directional
   actuation, resulting in a reflexed airfoil. Numerical simulations were
   conducted using a Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence
   model for low Reynolds-number flow, in addition to wind tunnel
   experiments. Nine different wing configurations were considered
   consisting of combinations of 3 sweep angles and 3 airfoil profiles,
   including unactuated (baseline), monotonic camber actuation, and reflex
   actuation. These geometries were 3D printed on a high resolution
   printer. Tests were conducted in a 2 ft. x 2 ft. wind tunnel at the
   University of Michigan at a flow speed of 10 m/s, consistent with the
   flow regime expected for this scale of aircraft. The preliminary results
   suggest a definite improvement in flight performance associated with the
   proposed coupling.}},

Abstract = {{Wave propagation inside a host media with periodically distributed
   inclusions can exhibit bandgaps. While controlling acoustic wave
   propagation has large impact on many engineering applications, studies
   on broadband acoustic bandgap (ABG) adaptation is still outstanding. One
   of the important properties of periodic structure in ABG design is the
   lattice-type. It is possible that by reconfiguring the periodic
   architectures between different lattice-types with fundamentally
   distinct dispersion relations, we may achieve broadband wave propagation
   tuning. In this spirit, this research pioneers a new class of
   reconfigurable periodic structures called origami metastructures (OM)
   that can achieve ABG adaption via topology reconfiguration by rigid
   folding. It is found that origami folding, which can enable significant
   and precise topology reconfigurations between distinct Bravais
   lattice-types in underlying periodic architecture, can bring about
   drastic changes in wave propagation behavior. Such versatile wave
   transmission control is demonstrated via numerical studies that couple
   wave propagation theory with origami folding kinematics. Further, we
   also exploit the novel ABG adaptation feature of OM to design structures
   that can exhibit unique tunable non reciprocal behavior. Overall the
   broadband adaptable wave characteristics of the OM coupled with scale
   independent rigid-folding mechanism can bring on-demand wave tailoring
   to a new level.}},

   is the detector arrays to convert analog signal into digital input.
   The SSPP waveguide includes periodic grooves, which are filled with a

Abstract = {{While renewable generation sources provide many economic and
   environmental benefits for the operation of power systems, their
   inherent stochastic nature introduces challenges from the perspective of
   reliability. Existing optimal power flow (OPF) methods must therefore be
   extended to consider forecast errors to mitigate in an economic manner
   the uncertainty that renewable generation introduces. This paper
   presents an AC-QP OPF solution algorithm that has been modified to
   include wind generation uncertainty. We solve the resulting stochastic
   optimization problem using a scenario based algorithm that is based on
   randomized methods that provide probabilistic guarantees of the
   solution. The proposed method produces an AC-feasible solution while
   satisfying reasonable reliability criteria. Test cases are included for
   the IEEE 14-bus network that has been augmented with 2 wind generators.
   The scalability, optimality and reliability achieved by the proposed
   method are then assessed.}},

   influences tapping frequency. In particular, we show that loose
   regulation results in excessive downstream (distribution) transformer
   tapping, while tight regulation causes upstream (subtransmission)
   tapping. We use yearlong simulations of a simple test network to
   generate tap trajectories and trade-off curves, illuminating the
   trade-off between subtransmission and distribution transformer wear. The
   paper concludes with a description of future work based on joint
   minimization of upstream and downstream tapping operations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies slip in friction drives in the context of a precision
   servo positioner equipped with a twist-roller friction drive. The servo
   positioner is modeled using a two-mass model that includes the
   experimentally-identified nonlinear slip dynamics of the friction drive.
   The model is then used to design an observer-based compensation scheme
   aimed at reducing the slip-induced performance degradation of the servo
   positioner's linear time invariant controller. The compensation scheme
   is validated in simulations and experiments using state feedback
   controllers. Tracking performance with the proposed slip compensation
   scheme, compared with the original controller and an intuitive high pass
   filter approach, is shown to improve considerably.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents and compares two methods for trading off energy
   efficiency and feedforward tracking accuracy using filtered basis
   functions. In the regular filtered basis function (FBF) approach, the
   control input to the system is expressed as a linear combination of
   basis functions. The basis functions are forward filtered using the
   dynamics of the system and their coefficients selected such that a
   performance index which penalizes tracking errors is minimized. It is
   shown that, in the regular FBF approach, varying the number of basis
   functions can be used to tradeoff energy efficiency (control energy) and
   tracking accuracy. Another way of achieving the same goal using FBFs is
   to minimize a weighted sum of tracking and control energy objectives
   (i.e., linear quadratic tracking) using a fixed number of basis
   functions. Simulation-based examples are used to compare both approaches
   with regard to their degree of tradeoff between tracking accuracy and

Abstract = {{Introduction: Thoracic aortic stent grafts are orders of magnitude
   stiffer than the native aorta. These devices have been associated with
   acute hypertension, elevated pulse pressure, cardiac remodelling and
   reduced coronary perfusion. However, a systematic assessment of such
   cardiovascular effects of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is
   missing. The CardiOvascular Remodelling following Endovascular aortic
   repair (CORE) study aims to (1) quantify cardiovascular remodelling
   following TEVAR and compare echocardiography against MRI, the reference
   method; (2) validate computational modelling of cardiovascular
   haemodynamics following TEVAR using clinical measurements, and virtually
   assess the impact of more compliant stent grafts on cardiovascular
   haemodynamics; and (3) investigate diagnostic accuracy of ECG and serum
   biomarkers for cardiac remodelling compared to MRI.
   Methods and analysis: This is a prospective, nonrandomised,
   observational cohort study. We will use MRI, CT, echocardiography,
   intraluminal pressures, ECG, computational modelling and serum
   biomarkers to assess cardiovascular remodelling in two groups of
   patients with degenerative thoracic aneurysms or penetrating aortic
   ulcers: (1) patients managed with TEVAR and (2) control patients managed
   with medical therapy alone. Power analysis revealed a minimum total
   sample size of 20 patients (alpha=0.05, power=0.97) to observe
   significant left ventricular mass increase following TEVAR after 1 year.
   Consequently, we will include 12 patients in both groups. Advanced MRI
   sequences will be used to assess myocardial and aortic strain and
   distensibility, myocardial perfusion and aortic flow. ECG,
   echocardiography and serum biomarkers will be collected and compared
   against the imaging data. Computational models will be constructed from
   each patient imaging data, analysed and validated. All measurements will
   be collected at baseline (prior to TEVAR) and 1-year follow-up. The
   expected study period is 3 years.
   Ethics and dissemination: This study has been approved by the University
   of Michigan IRB. The results will be disseminated through scientific
   journals and conference presentations.}},

   Learning Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Abstract = {{The proliferation of electronic health records (EHRs) frames
   opportunities for using machine learning to build models that help
   healthcare providers improve patient outcomes. However, building useful
   risk stratification models presents many technical challenges including
   the large number of factors (both intrinsic and extrinsic) influencing a
   patient's risk of an adverse outcome and the inherent evolution of that
   risk over time. We address these challenges in the context of learning a
   risk stratification model for predicting which patients are at risk of
   acquiring a Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We take a novel
   data-centric approach, leveraging the contents of EHRs from nearly
   50,000 hospital admissions. We show how, by adapting techniques from
   multitask learning, we can learn models for patient risk stratification
   with unprecedented classification performance. Our model, based on
   thousands of variables, both time-varying and time-invariant, changes
   over the course of a patient admission. Applied to a held out set of
   approximately 25,000 patient admissions, we achieve an area under the
   receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95\% CI 0.78-0.84). The
   model has been integrated into the health record system at a large
   hospital in the US, and can be used to produce daily risk estimates for
   each inpatient. While more complex than traditional risk stratification
   methods, the widespread development and use of such data-driven models
   could ultimately enable cost-effective, targeted prevention strategies
   that lead to better patient outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{A wearable gas chromatographic microanalytical system (GC) for
   near-real-time recognition and quantification of volatile organic
   compounds (VOC) in complex mixtures encountered in working environments

   weighs just 2.1 kg, has 3-D printed packaging, and can be worn on the
   belt to autonomously measure exposures to industrial VOC mixtures
   several times per hour. Novel features of the discrete DRIE-Si/Pyrex
   micro-component chips include a dual-adsorbent preconcentrator/focuser
   (PCF) with split-flow injections as narrow as 600 ms (benzene), a 6-m
   long segmented separation mu column with zone heating for power
   efficient separations; and a fluidically redesigned array of mu
   chemiresistors (mu CR) with thiolate-monolayer protected Au nanoparticle
   (MPN) interface films that provide sensitive detection and diverse
   response patterns for recognizing eluting VOCs. Embedded microcontrol
   allows for continuous unattended operation and storage of data for
   post-exposure downloading and analysis. In our first tests of the
   complete prototype, we have demonstrated reproducible analyses of
   mixtures of up to 9 VOCs in 2.5 min (sampling and analysis), linear
   calibration curves, unique response patterns for mixture components,
   sub-ppm LODs, and stable responses for 5 days. Initial mock field tests

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) performs arithmetic on randomized bit-streams
   called stochastic numbers (SNs) using standard logic circuits. SC has
   many appealing features such as error tolerance, low power, and low area
   cost. However, it suffers from severe accuracy loss due to correlation
   or insufficient randomness. SNs can be decorrelated by regenerating them
   from independent random sources. This is the preferred decorrelation
   method mentioned in the literature, but it often entails huge area and
   delay overhead. An attractive alternative is isolation-based
   decorrelation, which is the focus of this research. Isolation works by
   inserting delays (isolators) into a stochastic circuit to eliminate
   undesirable interactions among its SNs. Surprisingly, although it has
   far lower cost than regeneration, isolation has not been studied
   systematically before, hindering its practical use. The paper first
   examines the basic characteristics of SC isolation. We show that unless
   carefully used, it can result in excessive isolator numbers or
   unexpectedly corrupt a circuit's function. We therefore formally
   characterize the behavior of an isolation-decorrelated circuit, and
   derive conditions for correct deployment of isolators. We then describe
   the first isolator placement algorithm designed to minimize the number
   of isolators. Finally, we present supporting data obtained from
   simulation experiments on representative circuits.}},

   previous learners' collective input. Results from a case study
   deployment and a randomized experiment demonstrate that AXIS elicits and

   will explain possible alternative physical realizations and reveal the

Abstract = {{In this paper we combine aspects of the PRAM and mesh models to achieve
   the benefits of each. Many fast algorithms are known for the PRAM, but
   it is unrealistic to build. Another well-known model is the
   2-dimensional mesh, of which many have been built, but the algorithms
   are constrained by the mesh's diameter and bisection bandwidth, forcing
   algorithms for nontrivial problems to take time which is at least the
   square root of the number of processors. Here we use a minuscule amount
   of shared memory to make a practical design which is significantly
   faster than the standard mesh. We call this the shared memory mesh. We
   give several algorithms which show that a small amount of shared memory
   can significantly reduce the time for problems such as finding the
   median, labeling the connected components of an image, and labeling the
   connected components of a graph. Further, we show that many of these
   algorithms are optimal.}},

Abstract = {{We applied the BroadBand Green's Function with Low wavenumber extraction
   (BBGFL) to calculate band diagrams of periodic structures with
   non-circular dielectric scatterers. A low wavenumber component is
   subtracted out from the periodic Green's function to obtain the
   broadband periodic Green's function with fast convergence. The broadband
   Green's functions of both the background and the scatterer are applied
   to the surface integral equations of the dielectric periodic structures
   in two dimensions (2D). Method of moments (MoM) is used to discretize
   the surface integral equations, which makes the approach applicable to
   arbitrary geometries of the scatterer. The resulting matrix equations
   are converted into a linear eigenvalue problem where the impedance
   matrix is independent of wavenumber so that the eigenvector and
   eigenvalues can be obtained all at once. The eigenvectors are next used
   to calculate the modal field distributions over the entire periodic
   lattice. The band diagram close to the Gamma point in the Brillouin zone
   are related to the low frequency dispersion relations. Results are
   illustrated for periodic air voids of elliptical cross sections with
   triangular lattices on a dielectric host medium.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present the design and the experimental validation of a
   novel Bessel-beam launcher suitable for millimeter-wave applications. A
   zeroth-order Bessel beam is generated for the vertical component of the
   electric field. This is achieved by exciting a higher-order TM leaky
   mode in a grounded dielectric slab loaded with a capacitive impedance
   sheet. The distinctive feature of the proposed device is the use of a
   higher-order leaky mode: this allows scaling of the device to higher
   frequencies than would be possible using previous designs based on the
   fundamental leaky mode. As a result, thinning of the dielectric layer is
   avoided and ohmic losses are reduced. Simple design rules are provided
   for these types of devices. Measurements of a final prototype together
   with full-wave simulations validate the Bessel-beam generation in the
   desired mm-wave range.}},

   tangential electric fields of an antenna under test (AUT) at surfaces
   enclosing the antenna are accurately measured by a unique measurement
   system with a non-intrusive electro-optical (EO) probe, eliminating the
   need for costly large anechoic chamber facilities. We also develop a
   simple near-field to far-field transformation method to derive exact
   far-field quantities of the AUT. This method can provide the full
   spherical radiation pattern and gain of all types of antennas without
   any truncation errors. To demonstrate the proposed approach, a low-VHF
   folded dipole {[}1] is employed. The measured results agree very well
   with simulation results and those obtained from far-field measurement

   broadband Wilkinson power divider Schiffman phase shifter to achieve the
   required power division and phase shift over the entire band for the
   entire band between the two polarizations. The simulation shows that the

   from the autocorrelation function (ACF) of multipath microwave emission.
   We report measurements of the snowpack thickness using WiBAR at the
   University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) in winter 2015. The
   observations are done at frequencies from 1 to 3 GHz. At these
   frequencies, the volume and surface scattering are small in the
   snowpacks. This technique is inherently low-power since there is no
   transmitter as opposed to active remote sensing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{A very compact and conformal launcher for single conductor transmission

   pipes as the conductor of SCTL is introduced for the first time to
   satisfy the need for cost-effective and real-time data communication in
   drilling process. It is shown that a TM surface wave can be launched
   effectively making use of the drilling mud around the drill pipe.
   Provision of TM surface wave launchers that can fit within the borehole
   at both ends makes it feasible to transmit data over the drill pipe from
   downhole to the surface and vice-versa. The launcher is composed of an
   open ended helical conductor which concentrically surrounds the drill
   pipe with appropriate pitch and length forming a compact surface wave
   launcher. Keeping its dimension smaller than 0.0063 lambda x 0.0063
   lambda x 0.06 lambda, the proposed launcher provides 250 kHz bandwidth

Abstract = {{Neural language models, such as word embedding, can effectively embed
   words into vector spaces and preserve linguistic regularities and
   semantic relationships. However, few researchers have shown their
   effectiveness on medical terms and relationships. In this paper, we
   study the applicability of word2vec, a well-known technique for word
   embedding, to embed medical terms and relations based on different
   medical text corpora, including biomedical abstracts of scientific
   papers, health-related discussion forums, and a commonly available
   general-purpose information resource. We empirically evaluate the
   applicability of this approach by studying how the word embedding
   projects certain classes of medical terms and relations to the word
   space and analyzing the differences between the three corpora for
   embedding medical terms and relations. Results show that the corpus of
   health-related discussion forum posts, authored by lay persons and
   medical novices, trains a comparable word embedding for popular medical
   terms, when compared against a professionally authored corpus of
   published biomedical abstracts.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio technology, which is designed to enhance spectrum
   utilization, depends on the success of opportunistic access, where
   secondary users (SUs) exploit spectrum void unoccupied by primary users
   (PUs) for transmissions. We note that the system behaviors are very
   similar to the interactions among different species coexisting in an
   ecosystem. However, SUs of a selfish nature or of misleading information
   may make concurrent transmissions with PUs for additional incentives,
   and thus disrupt the entire ecosystem. By exploiting this vulnerability,
   this paper proposes a novel distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack
   where invasive species, i.e., malicious users (MUs), induce originally
   normal-behaved SUs to execute concurrent transmissions with PUs and thus
   collapse the cognitive radio network. We adopt stochastic geometry to
   model the spatial distributions of PUs, SUs, and MUs for the analysis of
   the mutual interference among them. The access strategy of each SU in
   the spectrum sharing ecosystem, which evolves with the experienced
   payoffs and interference, is modeled by an evolutionary game. Based on
   the evolutionary stable strategy concept, we could efficiently identify
   the fragile operating region at which normal-behaved SUs are eventually
   evolved to conduct concurrent transmissions and thus to cause the ruin
   of the network.}},

Abstract = {{In shifting process for the two-speed AMT (automated manual
   transmission) in this paper, the position of synchronizer sleeve is
   reflected by output signal of an angular displacement sensor, therefore,
   the normal operation of the sensor is the key to complete shifting
   accurately and reliably. To improve the fault-tolerant ability of
   two-speed AMT for electric vehicles, the operation principle of the
   shifting actuator and the shifting process of the two-speed AMT are
   analyzed. A signal revised strategy and a vehicle failure mode are
   proposed for the sensor signal drift and sensor fault respectively. A
   test bed based on dSPACE real time simulation was set up for the
   two-speed AMT and the sensor fault diagnosis and processing strategy was
   verified by experiment. The experiment results indicate that the
   proposed strategy can be achieved under the simulation of sensor signal
   drift and sensor fault, improving the reliability of the AMT.}},

Title = {{Patient Risk Stratification with Time-Varying Parameters: A Multitask
   Learning Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Abstract = {{The proliferation of electronic health records (EHRs) frames
   opportunities for using machine learning to build models that help
   healthcare providers improve patient outcomes. However, building useful
   risk stratification models presents many technical challenges including
   the large number of factors (both intrinsic and extrinsic) influencing a
   patient's risk of an adverse outcome and the inherent evolution of that
   risk over time. We address these challenges in the context of learning a
   risk stratification model for predicting which patients are at risk of
   acquiring a Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We take a novel
   data-centric approach, leveraging the contents of EHRs from nearly
   50,000 hospital admissions. We show how, by adapting techniques from
   multitask learning, we can learn models for patient risk stratification
   with unprecedented classification performance. Our model, based on
   thousands of variables, both time-varying and time-invariant, changes
   over the course of a patient admission. Applied to a held out set of
   approximately 25,000 patient admissions, we achieve an area under the
   receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95\% CI 0.78-0.84). The
   model has been integrated into the health record system at a large
   hospital in the US, and can be used to produce daily risk estimates for
   each inpatient. While more complex than traditional risk stratification
   methods, the widespread development and use of such data-driven models
   could ultimately enable cost-effective, targeted prevention strategies
   that lead to better patient outcomes.}},

   The results are summarized using stability charts that are obtained via

Abstract = {{We present online algorithms for covering and packing problems with
   (non-linear) convex objectives. The convex covering problem is defined
   as: min(x is an element of R+)(n) f(x) s.t. Ax >= 1, where f : R-+(n) ->
   R+ is a monotone convex function, and A is an m x n matrix with
   non-negative entries. In the online version, a new row of the constraint
   matrix, representing a new covering constraint, is revealed in each step
   and the algorithm is required to maintain a feasible and monotonically
   non-decreasing assignment x over time. We also consider a convex packing
   problem defined as: max(y is an element of R+)(m) Sigma(m)(j-1) y(j) -
   g(A(T) y), where g : R-+(n) -> R+ is a monotone convex function. In the
   online version, each variable y(j) arrives online and the algorithm must
   decide the value of y(j) on its arrival. This represents the Fenchel
   dual of the convex covering program, when g is the convex conjugate of
   f. We use a primal-dual approach to give online algorithms for these
   generic problems, and use them to simplify, unify, and improve upon
   previous results for several applications.}},

Abstract = {{The trapdoor channel is a binary input/output/state channel with state
   changing deterministically as the modulo-2 sum of the current input,
   output and state. At each state, it behaves as one of two Z channels,
   each with crossover probability 1/2. Permuter et al. formulated the
   problem of finding the capacity of the trapdoor channel with feedback as
   a stochastic control problem. By solving the corresponding Bellman
   fixed-point equation, they showed that the capacity equals C = log
   1+root 5/2.
   In this paper, we consider the chemical channel, which is a
   generalization of the trapdoor channel, whereby at each state the
   corresponding Z channel has crossover probability p. We characterize the
   capacity of this problem as the solution of a Bellman fixed-point
   equation corresponding to a Markov decision process (MDP). Numerical
   solution of this fixed-point equation reveals an unexpected behavior,
   that is, for a range of crossover probabilities, the capacity seems to
   be constant. Our main contribution is to formalize and prove this
   observation. In particular, by explicitly solving the Bellman equation,
   we show the existence of an interval {[}0.5,p{*}] over which the
   capacity remains constant. To the authors' knowledge, this is the only
   known channel for which such behavior is observed.}},

Abstract = {{Shayevitz and Feder proposed a capacity-achieving sequential
   transmission scheme for memoryless channels called posterior matching
   (PM). The proof of capacity achievability of PM is involved and requires
   invertibility of the PM kernel (also referred to as one-step
   invertibility). Recent work by the same authors provided a simpler proof
   but still requires PM kernel invertibility.
   An alternative technique for proving capacity achievability of PM for
   memoryless channels is due to Ma and Coleman which is based on
   connections between PM and non-linear filtering. Central to this
   technique is a different notion of ``invertibility{''} which refers to
   the property of PM that allows recovering the original message W from
   knowledge of the observations and the value of the posterior message cdf
   evaluated at the true message. Unfortunately, this property is also
   proved by appealing to PM kernel invertibility. As a result, all these
   techniques cannot be readily generalized to channels with non-invertible
   PM kernels.
   In this paper we analyze PM schemes for channels with memory and in
   particular unifilar channels with output feedback and
   intersymbol-interference (ISI) finite state channels with state and
   output feedback. We follow closely the alternative technique of Ma and
   Coleman and focus on zero-rate achievability which is the first step of
   the proof. Our main technical contribution is to show that
   ``invertibility{''} can be obtained without requiring an invertible PM
   kernel. This is an indispensable property since in channels with memory
   the PM kernel is not invertible.}},

   paths that facilitate the performance of the barrier-based coordination

Abstract = {{A cost-effective, low-power, ZigBee-based compact radio system tuned for
   operation at low VHF band is proposed for mobile communications in
   complex environments. Existing off-the-shelf radios at this band are
   bulky, usually operate at high power levels (a few watts), and require
   relatively large antennas to enable long range communications. To remedy
   these shortcomings, we develop a small-form-factor low-VHF radio that
   leverages the ZigBee technology with a frequency conversion technique. A
   bi-directional frequency converter for the radio is designed to
   translate ZigBee signals into low-VHF carriers and optimized to minimize
   power consumption, and simultaneously maximize system gain and
   sensitivity. This radio also comes with a newly developed miniaturized
   antenna {[}1] (<= 0.02 lambda(0) in height and lateral dimensions at 40
   MHz) having much higher efficiency compared to antennas of similar
   sizes. This antenna allows the compact radio system to operate at lower
   power and on small robotic platforms needed for military or rescue

Abstract = {{DNA lasers self-amplify optical signals from a DNA analyte as well as
   thermodynamic differences between sequences, allowing quasi-digital DNA
   detection. However, these systems have drawbacks, such as relatively
   large sample consumption and complicated dye labelling. Moreover,
   although the lasing signal can detect the target DNA, it is superimposed
   on an unintended fluorescence background, which persists for non-target
   DNA samples as well. From an optical point of view, it is thus not truly
   digital detection and requires spectral analysis to identify the target.
   In this work, we propose and demonstrate an optofluidic laser that has a
   single layer of DNA molecules as the gain material. A target DNA
   produces intensive laser emission comparable to existing DNA lasers,
   while any unnecessary fluorescence background is successfully
   suppressed. As a result, the target DNA can be detected with a single
   laser pulse, in a truly digital manner. Since the DNA molecules cover
   only a single layer on the surface of the laser microcavity, the DNA
   sample consumption is a few orders of magnitude lower than that of
   existing DNA lasers. Furthermore, the DNA molecules are stained by
   simply immersing the microcavity in the intercalating dye solution, and
   thus the proposed DNA laser is free of any complex dye-labelling process

Abstract = {{In the setting of multiparty computation, a set of mutually distrusting
   parties wish to securely compute a joint function of their private
   inputs. A protocol is adaptively secure if honest parties might get
   corrupted after the protocol has started. Recently (TCC 2015) three
   constant-round adaptively secure protocols were presented {[} 10,11,15].
   All three constructions assume that the parties have access to a common
   reference string (CRS) whose size depends on the function to compute,
   even when facing semi-honest adversaries. It is unknown whether
   constant-round adaptively secure protocols exist, without assuming
   access to such a CRS.
   In this work, we study adaptively secure protocols which only rely on a
   short CRS that is independent on the function to compute.
   - First, we raise a subtle issue relating to the usage of
   non-interactive non-committing encryption within security proofs in the
   UC framework, and explain how to overcome it. We demonstrate the problem
   in the security proof of the adaptively secure oblivious-transfer
   protocol from {[}8] and provide a complete proof of this protocol.
   - Next, we consider the two-party setting where one of the parties has a
   polynomial-size input domain, yet the other has no constraints on its
   input. We show that assuming the existence of adaptively secure
   oblivious transfer, every deterministic functionality can be computed
   with adaptive security in a constant number of rounds.
   - Finally, we present a new primitive called non-committing
   indistinguishability obfuscation, and show that this primitive is
   complete for constructing adaptively secure pro-tocols with round
   complexity independent of the function.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, operating at near-threshold supply voltages has been
   proposed to improve energy efficiency in circuits, yet decreased
   efficacy of dynamic voltage scaling has been observed in recent planar
   technologies. However, foundries have introduced a shift from planar to
   FinFET fabrication processes. In this paper, we study 7nm FinFET's
   ability to voltage scale and compare it to planar technologies across
   three dynamic voltage scaling scenarios. The switch to FinFET allows for
   a return to strong voltage scalability. We find up to 8.6x higher energy
   efficiency at NT compared to nominal supply voltage (vs. 4.8x gain in
   20nm planar).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents Neighbor-Guided Semi Global Matching (NG-fSGM), a
   new method for optical flow. It is based on SGM, a popular dynamic
   programming algorithm for stereo vision, where the disparity of each
   pixel is calculated by aggregating local matching costs over the entire
   image to resolve local ambiguity in texture-less and occluded regions.
   Unlike conventional SGM, NG-fSGM operates on a subset of the search
   space that has been aggressively pruned based on neighboring pixels'
   information. Our proposed method achieves a fast approximation of SGM
   with significantly simpler cost aggregation and flow computation.
   Compared to a prior SGM extension for optical flow, the proposed NG-fSGM
   provides about 9x reduction in the number of computations and 5x
   reduction in the memory requirement with only 0.17\% accuracy
   degradation when evaluated with Middlebury benchmark test cases.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional passive radar systems with a noisy reference signal use the
   cross-correlation statistic for detection. However, owing to the
   composite nature of this hypothesis testing problem, no claims can be
   made about the optimality of this detector. Therefore, exploiting the
   low-rank structure of most passive radar illuminators, we recently
   proposed singular value decomposition based detectors that outperform
   the CC detector. In this paper, we derive the generalized likelihood
   ratio tests for this signal model and compare with our proposed SVD
   based detectors. We demonstrate the near CFAR behavior (highly
   desirable) of our SVD detectors. We show that on the other hand, the
   GLRT detectors have a varying probability of false alarm with changing
   reference channel characteristics making it impractical to use them in a

Abstract = {{Given a large homogeneous collection of switched systems, we consider a
   novel class of safety constraints, called mode-counting constraints,
   that impose restrictions on the number of systems that are in a
   particular mode. We propose an approach for synthesizing
   correct-by-construction switching protocols to enforce such constraints
   over time. Our approach starts by constructing an approximately
   bisimilar abstraction of the individual system model. Then, we show that
   the aggregate behavior of the collection can be represented by a linear
   system, whose system matrices are induced by the transition graph of the
   abstraction. Finally, the control synthesis problem with mode-counting
   constraints is reduced to a cycle assignment problem on the transition
   graph. One salient feature of the proposed approach is its scalability;
   the computational complexity is independent of the number of systems
   involved. We illustrate this approach on the problem of coordinating a
   large collection of thermostatically controlled loads while ensuring a
   bound on the number of loads that are extracting power from the
   electricity grid at any given time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses optimal control to simultaneously optimize the motion

   compare the energetics of four different actuator configurations: a

   in the leg (SEA), series hip and parallel leg, series hip and series
   leg, and parallel hip and parallel leg. We use realistic models with
   mass in the legs and feet, damping in the springs, and detailed DC
   electric motor models. The comparison is carried out for the cost of
   transport of three energetic measures: positive motor work, electrical

   velocity. In our optimization we include motor parameters, stiffness,
   and spring pre-compression terms as free variables, ensuring that we
   compare the energetically optimal version of each configuration at each
   velocity. We show that for the positive motor work and the electrical
   losses costs of transport (COT), the parallel hip and series leg
   configuration is energetically optimal. For the electrical work, the
   optimal configuration is speed dependent, with series hip and parallel
   leg optimal at low speeds, and both series hip series leg and parallel
   hip series leg optimal at high speeds.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile robotic teams require robust communication in order to coordinate
   effectively, which is a challenge given the dynamic, unpredictable
   nature of mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). These networks are subject to
   rapidly varying link qualities as robots move through their environment.
   Improving the robustness of these point-to-point links leads to greater
   overall network performance, which in turn allows the robots to perform
   their mission more effectively. In this work, we present a forward error
   correction (FEC) technique that exploits latency tolerance in network
   traffic to provide consistent packet delivery performance even on
   low-quality links. Our proposed system estimates link quality based on
   recent packet reception history and uses that estimate to determine FEC
   encoding strength. Furthermore, this system provides a novel Quality of
   Service (QoS) mechanism that trades latency tolerance for more reliable,
   lower overhead transmission. We evaluate the effectiveness of this
   technique in a real-world robotic testbed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a model-assisted bundle adjustment framework in
   which visually-derived features are fused with an underlying
   three-dimensional (3D) mesh provided a priori. By using an approach
   inspired by the expectation-maximization (EM) class of algorithms, we
   introduce a hidden binary label for each visual feature that indicates
   if that feature is considered part of the nominal model, or if the
   feature corresponds to 3D structure that is absent from this model.
   Therefore, in addition to improved estimates of the feature locations,
   we can also label the features based on their deviation from the model.
   We show that this method is a special case of the Gaussian max-mixtures
   framework, which can be efficiently incorporated into state-of-the-art
   graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solvers. We
   provide field tests taken from the Bluefin Robotics Hovering Autonomous
   Underwater Vehicle (HAUV) surveying the SS Curtiss.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides experimental results for elimination of lateral-wave
   spurious modes observed in switchable ferroelectric BST-on-Si composite
   FBARs using a frame design technique. This approach is used in
   piezoelectric FBAR design, however here it is applied for the first time
   to design intrinsically switchable ferroelectric BST acoustic
   resonators. The BST-on-Si composite FBAR presented here is a structure
   with the dispersion type-I characteristic, which requires a raised frame
   to eliminate any higher-order lateral-wave spurious modes. Based on 2-D
   Multiphysics simulations, FBARs with and without a frame are designed,
   verifying the utility of using a frame to improve device performance.
   Both FBARs are fabricated and measured, and then their performance is
   compared. Measurement results validate the effectiveness of a frame in
   the design of switchable BST FBARs, allowing for device performance
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{A design method for BAW filters based on intrinsically switchable
   ferroelectric BST FBARs is presented. A complete set of design equations
   for ladder-type FBAR filters is derived based on the popular filter
   synthesis method using image parameters. For the first time, a complete
   analysis is performed that accurately calculates both the image
   impedance and propagation constant for BAW filters. Closed-form design
   equations as a function of FBAR and filter specifications are provided.
   As an experimental verification, a 1.5-stage switchable ferroelectric
   BST FBAR filter is designed, fabricated, and measured. When a dc bias is
   applied, a switchable filter is in its on-state and provides an
   insertion loss of 5.77 dB with a fractional bandwidth of 1.22\% at 1.97
   GHz. When in its off-state, the filter exhibits more than 22 dB
   isolation. Circuit-level simulation results are in very good agreement

   monitoring and corresponding task assessment. Among diverse sensors, an
   accelerometer has great potential for automated action recognition due
   to its data richness and mobility. In this paper, we propose wrist-worn
   accelerometer-based action recognition with selected features and
   classifiers and apply it to masonry work to demonstrate its feasibility.
   The novelty of this approach is the use of a single affordable
   wrist-worn sensor, which would not interfere with workers' ongoing work.
   The result shows that Multilayer Perceptron classifier can achieve about
   97\% of accuracy in posture classification in masonry work. The proposed
   approach has an immense potential to be used for non-intrusive action
   recognition for construction workers, which can open a door for diverse
   productivity analyses.}},

Abstract = {{In construction, workers are frequently exposed to manual handling tasks
   involving repetitive and forceful activities with awkward postures. As a
   result, construction workers are at about a fifty percent higher risk of
   work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) than workers in other
   industries. Several ergonomic methods for evaluating workers' postural
   stresses through observations (e.g., OWAS, PATH, or RULA) have been
   applied to identify the risks of WMSDs during occupational tasks
   including construction. While inexpensive and practical to use, these
   methods are constrained by time-consuming procedures, observer bias, and
   the need for a well-trained analyst. These issues are exacerbated in the
   context of construction. In contrast to other factory-based (e.g.,
   manufacturing) industries, construction is subject to irregular work
   patterns, relatively longer cycle time, and a wide variety of tasks. To
   address these issues, we propose computer vision-based posture
   classification that can automate existing observation-based postural
   evaluation methods such as OWAS. Specifically, the proposed method can
   classify workers' postures according to pre-defined ergonomic checklists
   using shape-and radial histogram-based features from video sequences. To
   test the feasibility of the proposed approach, we conducted a laboratory
   test with five subjects by simulating three representative postures
   according to upper limbs, back, and lower limbs. The results from the
   case study demonstrate that it can provide more reliable posture
   classification results with about 93\% of accuracy. The proposed
   approach enables practitioners to identify the risk of WMSDs through
   automated ergonomic postural evaluation of on-going tasks only by taking
   videos at sites, which helps to prevent WMSDs for diverse occupational
   tasks including construction.}},

Abstract = {{On-site worker observation is a fundamental task for a wide spectrum of
   construction applications such as safety behavior monitoring and
   productivity analysis. Vision-based action recognition techniques have
   been proposed to complement the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks
   involved in manual observation. In construction, however, previous
   studies have mainly utilized an RGB-D sensor (e.g., Microsoft Kinect),
   the operating conditions of which (e.g., active ranges from 80 cm to 4
   m, sensitivity to sun light) may hinder the application to actual
   construction jobsites. To address these issues, we propose a
   silhouette-based human action recognition method using a single video
   camera that has less operational constraint. In this framework, the
   human worker is localized and tracked throughout the monocular video,
   based on both spatial (i.e., contour of worker) and temporal changes
   (i.e., moving direction and speed over consecutive frames). Then human
   action models are learned with temporally adjacent frames and utilized
   to recognize similar actions in testing video by computing the
   similarity between the learned action model and newly computed model in
   a testing dataset. For performance evaluation, we carried out lab
   experiments, in which a video camera was installed 5-10 m from multiple
   human subjects. Results indicate that the proposed framework performs
   well (i.e., an accuracy of 90.68\%) to capture predefined poses (e.g.,
   walking, lifting, crawling) in image sequences. This study thus explores
   an automated means for worker monitoring which potentially helps
   understand and measure human motions without significant human effort.}},

Abstract = {{The building construction sector continues to be a major consumer of
   energy in the United States. Energy consumption in a building typically
   spans across various life-cycle phases such as the material production
   and constriction phase, use and maintenance phase, and the end-of- life
   phase, with the use and maintenance phase constituting around 80\% of
   total energy requirements. Since people spend most of their time
   indoors, the energy use behavior of building occupants is a critical
   factor that affects the total energy consumption. In this paper, an
   agent based model which simulates the effects of this dynamic occupant
   behavior is coupled with an energy use simulation model through a
   distributed computing environment based on the principles defined in the
   lightweight communications and marshalling (LCM), a common tool employed
   in robotics. The framework addresses two main objectives: (1) achieve
   multimodal synchronization and data exchange of distinct and spatially
   distributed simulation models and (2) visualize the effect of dynamic
   occupant behavior on the life cycle energy consumption in a building.
   This framework will achieve data synchronization and transfer of
   information between different software modules, which run simultaneously
   in a distributed fashion thereby testing the effects of various
   occupancy related energy interventions on life-cycle energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the severe consequences of building fires, evacuation
   planning is regarded as one of the most important issues in the design
   and management of facilities. During fires, occupants face significant
   uncertainty as to the severity of the situation and must continuously
   interpret new information from various sources (e.g., other occupants
   and environmental cues). Based on this influx of new information, and in
   conjunction with the individual's coping capability under duress, the
   occupant's perceived risk of the fire situation can change during the
   course of his/her evacuation. Despite the severity of such situations,
   the role of dynamic risk perception has been overlooked in the
   literature. Therefore, this research aims to analyze how dynamic risk
   perception influences evacuation performance through simulation
   modeling. An agent-based building fire evacuation simulation model and
   three different scenarios are examined to investigate the following
   evacuation performance metrics: evacuation rate, response time, and
   movement time. Our findings showed that after a fire alarm sounded
   individual perceived risk increased, resulting from observing the
   behavior of others, thereby initiating expedited evacuation movement.
   Similarly, increased perceived risk resulting from detecting fire smoke
   significantly accelerated occupant movement towards the exits. These
   findings highlight the significant role of dynamic perceived risk on
   fire evacuation performance. Understanding the importance of perceived
   risk on evacuation outcomes, facility managers could attempt to
   manipulate additional information that affects occupant perceived risk
   during the different stages of fire evacuations to improve evacuation
   effectiveness and efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile BIM is an emerging trend in the Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction (AEC) industry. The ubiquity of modern mobile devices
   allows users to access building information readily in the field using
   touchscreen interfaces, while built-in multi-sensors provide the ability
   for intuitive 3D navigation within the Building Information Model (BIM)
   environment. Despite the apparent advantages of universal access, the
   need to efficiently locate users in BIM environments and retrieve
   information they need in mobile contexts presents significant
   challenges. For jobsite workers, frequent touch manipulation, often
   wearing gloves, is challenging and inconvenient in on-site environments.
   Visual-sensor-based context-aware information computing offers a
   promising alternative to circumvent such issues. Taking advantage of
   omnipresent paper drawings in current on-site work practices, this
   research develops a mobile application, BIMap that utilizes physical
   plan drawings as Tangible User Interfaces for user localization in 3D
   BIM models. Through visual registration methods, various sections of
   drawings are identified as natural markers, containing corresponding BIM
   identification information such as drawing type, structure height,
   building floor, and CAD layer identifiers. The relationship between
   planar natural markers (i.e., drawings) and the planar device screen
   space is represented via a homography matrix. After this registration
   process, mobile users can readily localize themselves in BIM models by
   pointing out specific locations on plan drawings in the view of the
   mobile device's camera. The feasibility of the proposed approach was
   evaluated through four case studies, representing BIM models of various
   scales.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately modeling as-built environments and tracking moving objects'
   poses are critical for many architecture, engineering, construction, and
   facility management (AECFM) automation applications. Equally important
   are the reliability, operating range and cost efficiency of such
   solutions for their broad deployment in unstructured, dynamic, and
   sometimes featureless AECFM sites. In this paper, a flexible
   vision-based technique is developed for accurate, robust, low-cost, and
   scalable pose estimation and as-built modeling in AECFM applications.
   This technique combines marker-based pose estimation and
   structure-from-motion (SfM). In the preparation phase, a sparse set of
   visual markers are installed in the target environment. During the
   operation phase, a set of unordered images are taken with a calibrated
   RGB camera. These images are immediately processed by a SfM system to
   estimate those markers' poses and generate a sparse point cloud, which
   can be used by robots or other mobile clients for either moving objects'
   pose estimation, or dimensional analysis of that environment.
   Furthermore, for as-built modeling, the RGB camera is replaced by a RGBD
   camera to create both a dense 3D point cloud and a concise planar model
   of the environment. Experiments have demonstrated sufficient accuracy
   (average absolute error within 5 mm over a 9 m scale) of the proposed
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{Since energy expenditure (EE) has been proven an effective
   representation of physiological demands, field EE measurement enables us
   to assess worker's physical demands from ongoing construction tasks.
   However, because EE measurement requires special facilities and
   equipment, collecting data in the field remains challenging. One
   possible solution is to use heart rate (HR) to estimate EE according to
   a linear relationship between HR and EE. Recent advancements in a
   wristband-type activity tracker can potentially open new doors for field
   EE measurement, yet because its capacity for measurement is limited to
   aerobic free-living activities (e.g., walking), EE measurement may not
   be accurate for physically demanding construction works. To examine the
   potential of continuously measuring construction workers' EE from an
   activity tracker, we identified the following challenges: (1) need for
   different HR-EE relations for diverse tasks; (2) application of
   corresponding HR-EE relationship to such tasks and (3) accurate HR
   monitoring. To overcome these challenges, our in-depth investigation
   indicated that a wristband-type activity tracker has the potential to
   achieve reliable field EE measurement through automatic action
   recognition using an embedded accelerometer, and applying HR-EE
   relationships for corresponding actions with acceptable HR monitoring
   accuracy. By addressing these challenges, a proposed field EE
   measurement approach is expected to provide in-depth understanding and
   continuous monitoring of worker's physical demands from construction
   tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Workers' unsafe behavior is one of the main causes of construction
   accidents. Traditionally, to reduce workers' unsafe behavior,
   construction managers have focused on formal controls; however, these
   approaches have proven ineffective to elicit desired changes in
   improving safety behavior. To amend these interpretive limitations,
   increased attention has been paid to the social aspect of workers'
   safety behavior. While we know that workers' safety behavior is not only
   affected by workgroup norms but also subject to management norms, we
   have a limited understanding of how management norms and workgroup norms
   can be transformed into workers' safety behavior. Given this background,
   this study aims to investigate: (1) the effects of workers' perceptions
   of workgroup norms and management norms on safety behavior, and (2) the
   factors affecting the relationship between workers' perceptions of
   workgroup norms and management norms and safety behaviors. Results
   indicate that perceived workgroup norm partially mediates the effect of
   perceived management norms on safety behavior. In addition, project
   identity positively moderates effects of perceived management norm and
   negatively moderates effects of perceived workgroup on safety behavior.
   This study contributes to the theoretical foundations for a new way of
   construction safety management. Managerial efforts to promote positive
   social norms and workers' project identity can be an effective means for
   improving safety in construction sites.}},

Abstract = {{In many real-world classification problems, the labels of training
   examples are randomly corrupted. Most previous theoretical work on
   classification with label noise assumes that the two classes are
   separable, that the label noise is independent of the true class label,
   or that the noise proportions for each class are known. In this work, we
   give conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the true
   class-conditional distributions to be identifiable. These conditions are
   weaker than those analyzed previously, and allow for the classes to be
   nonseparable and the noise levels to be asymmetric and unknown. The
   conditions essentially state that a majority of the observed labels are
   correct and that the true class-conditional distributions are ``mutually
   irreducible,{''} a concept we introduce that limits the similarity of
   the two distributions. For any label noise problem, there is a unique
   pair of true class-conditional distributions satisfying the proposed
   conditions, and we argue that this pair corresponds in a certain sense
   to maximal denoising of the observed distributions.
   Our results are facilitated by a connection to ``mixture proportion
   estimation,{''} which is the problem of estimating the maximal
   proportion of one distribution that is present in another. We establish
   a novel rate of convergence result for mixture proportion estimation,
   and apply this to obtain consistency of a discrimination rule based on
   surrogate loss minimization. Experimental results on benchmark data and
   a nuclear particle classification problem demonstrate the efficacy of
   our approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a parallelized modeling technique for the efficient
   simulation of nonlinear ultrasonics introduced by the wave interaction
   with fatigue cracks. The elastodynamic wave equations with contact
   effects are formulated using an explicit Local Interaction Simulation
   Approach (LISA). The LISA formulation is extended to capture the
   contact-impact phenomena during the wave damage interaction based on the
   penalty method. A Coulomb friction model is integrated into the
   computation procedure to capture the stick-slip contact shear motion.
   The LISA procedure is coded using the Compute Unified Device
   Architecture (CUDA), which enables the highly parallelized
   supercomputing on powerful graphic cards. Both the explicit contact
   formulation and the parallel feature facilitates LISA's superb
   computational efficiency over the conventional finite element method
   (FEM). The theoretical formulations based on the penalty method is
   introduced and a guideline for the proper choice of the contact
   stiffness is given. The convergence behavior of the solution under
   various contact stiffness values is examined. A numerical benchmark
   problem is used to investigate the new LISA formulation and results are
   compared with a conventional contact finite element solution. Various
   nonlinear ultrasonic phenomena are successfully captured using this
   contact LISA formulation, including the generation of nonlinear higher
   harmonic responses. Nonlinear mode conversion of guided waves at fatigue
   cracks is also studied.}},

Abstract = {{Local interaction simulation approach (LISA) is a highly parallelizable
   numerical scheme for guided wave simulation in structural health
   monitoring (SHM). This paper addresses the issue of simulating wave
   propagation in unbounded domain through the implementation of
   non-reflective boundary (NRB) in LISA. In this study, two different
   categories of NRB, i.e., the non-reflective boundary condition (NRBC)
   and the absorbing boundary layer (ABL), have been investigated in the
   parallelized LISA scheme. For the implementation of NRBC, a set of
   general LISA equations considering the effect from boundary stress is
   obtained first. As a simple example, the Lysmer and Kuhlemeyer (L-K)
   model is applied here to demonstrate the easiness of NRBC implementation
   in LISA. As a representative of ABL implementation, the LISA scheme
   incorporating the absorbing layers with increasing damping (ALID) is
   also proposed, based on elasto-dynamic equations considering damping
   effect. Finally, an effective hybrid model combining L-K and ALID
   methods in LISA is developed, and guidelines for implementing the hybrid
   model is presented. Case studies on a three-dimensional plate model
   compares the performance of hybrid method to that of L-K and ALID acting
   independently. The simulation results demonstrate that best absorbing
   efficiency is achieved with the hybrid method.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the hierarchical structure and heterogeneity of most deployed
   wireless networks, multiple data transmissions using the same
   communication resource, such as frequency band and time slot, are likely
   to occur in the same area. Hence, interference becomes critical to the
   decoding of interfered signals. There have already been numerous
   techniques dealing with interferences that can be implemented either at
   the transmitter, the receiver or both, to support simultaneous
   multi-user transmissions. This paper focuses on the reception design in
   multiple access channels (MACs) where multiple transmitters send data to
   a common receiver simultaneously. By exploiting the
   constructive/destructive interactions among interfering signals, we
   propose a receiver structure based on interference combination (ICom)
   incorporating zero-forcing (ZF) and successive interference cancellation
   (SIC). The proposed receiver structure does not require coordination at
   the transmitter side and can significantly reduce the number of
   receiving antennas at a moderate processing cost. The ICom-based
   reception is shown to be able to not only achieve a significant
   improvement of system spectral efficiency (SE) under stringent latency
   constraints, but also make a flexible tradeoff between the requirement
   of receiving antennas and signal processing complexity, thus
   facilitating its implementation and deployment.}},

Abstract = {{Both interference alignment (IA) and interference neutralization (IN)
   are exploited for Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmissions. With the
   base station's cooperation, transmit precoder and receive filter are
   designed jointly, and then concurrent transmissions of multiple data
   streams are achieved. In the design of preprocessing, IN is applied to
   the interferences carrying same data so as to align the interfering
   signals with opposite directions in a subspace. On the other hand, for
   interferences carrying different information, IA is employed to align
   them with the same direction in a subspace, thus reducing the
   interference signal dimension observed at the user side. Based on
   different precoding schemes at the transmitter's side, receivers adopt
   zero-forcing (ZF) so as to recover the desired data. The proposed
   interference alignment and neutralization based CoMP (IAN-CoMP)
   mechanism can achieve effective interference cancellation and
   suppression by exploiting limited and flexible collaboration only at the
   base station (BS) side. We also extend the mechanism to general cases
   where the antenna configurations at both transmitter and receiver side,
   the number of transmitters participating in CoMP and simultaneously
   served users are variable. In addition, the proposed scheme can also
   achieve a flexible tradeoff between cooperation overhead and the
   system's achievable degrees of freedom (DoFs). Our in-depth simulation
   results show that IANCoMP can significantly improve the spectral
   efficiency (SE) for cell-edge users.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed denial-of-service attacks are an increasing problem facing
   web applications, for which many defense techniques have been proposed,
   including several moving-target strategies. These strategies typically
   work by relocating targeted services over time, increasing uncertainty
   for the attacker, while trying not to disrupt legitimate users or incur
   excessive costs. Prior work has not shown, however, whether and how a
   rational defender would choose a moving-target method against an
   adaptive attacker, and under what conditions. We formulate a
   denial-of-service scenario as a two-player game, and solve a
   restricted-strategy version of the game using the methods of empirical
   game-theoretic analysis. Using agent-based simulation, we evaluate the
   performance of strategies from prior literature under a variety of
   attacks and environmental conditions. We find evidence for the strategic
   stability of various proposed strategies, such as proactive server
   movement, delayed attack timing, and suspected insider blocking, along

Abstract = {{Traditional fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes only allow
   computation on data encrypted under a single key. Lopez-Alt, Tromer, and
   Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2012) proposed the notion of multi-key FHE, which
   allows homomorphic computation on ciphertexts encrypted under different
   keys, and also gave a construction based on a (somewhat nonstandard)
   assumption related to NTRU. More recently, Clear and McGoldrick (CRYPTO
   2015), followed by Mukherjee and Wichs (EUROCRYPT 2016), proposed a
   multi-key FHE that builds upon the LWE-based FHE of Gentry, Sahai, and
   Waters (CRYPTO 2013). However, unlike the original construction of
   Lopez-Alt et al., these later LWE-based schemes have the somewhat
   undesirable property of being ``single-hop for keys:{''} all relevant
   keys must be known at the start of the homomorphic computation, and the
   output cannot be usefully combined with ciphertexts encrypted under
   other keys (unless an expensive ``bootstrapping{''} step is performed).
   In this work we construct two multi-key FHE schemes, based on LWE
   assumptions, which are multi-hop for keys: the output of a homomorphic
   computation on ciphertexts encrypted under a set of keys can be used in
   further homomorphic computation involving additional keys, and so on.
   Moreover, incorporating ciphertexts associated with new keys is a
   relatively efficient ``native{''} operation akin to homomorphic
   multiplication, and does not require bootstrapping (in contrast with all
   other LWE-based solutions). Our systems also have smaller ciphertexts
   than the previous LWE-based ones; in fact, ciphertexts in our second
   construction are simply GSW ciphertexts with no auxiliary data.}},

Abstract = {{On-core microarchitectural structures consume significant portions of a
   processor's power budget. However, depending on application
   characteristics, those structures do not always provide (much)
   performance benefit. While timeout-based power gating techniques have
   been leveraged for under-utilized cores and inactive functional units,
   these techniques have not directly translated to high-activity units
   such as vector processing units, complex branch predictors, and caches.
   The performance benefit provided by these units does not necessarily
   correspond with unit activity, but instead is a function of application
   characteristics.
   This work introduces POWERCHOP, a novel technique that leverages the
   unique capabilities of HW/SW co-designed hybrid processors to enact
   unit-level power management at the application phase level. POWERCHOP
   adds two small additional hardware units to facilitate phase
   identification and triggering different power states, enabling the
   software layer to cheaply track, predict and take advantage of varying
   unit criticality across application phases by powering gating units that
   are not needed for performant execution. Through detailed
   experimentation, we find that POWERCHOP significantly decreases power
   consumption, reducing the leakage power of a hybrid server processor by
   9\% on average (up to 33\%) and a hybrid mobile processor by 19\% (up to
   40\%) while introducing just 2\% slowdown.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) out-of-order cores waste a significant
   portion of structural out-of-order core resources on instructions that
   do not need them. These resources eliminate false ordering dependences.
   However, because thread interleaving spreads dependent instructions,
   nearly half of instructions dynamically issue in program order after all
   false dependences have resolved. These in-sequence instructions
   interleave with other reordered instructions at a fine granularity
   within the instruction window. We develop a technique to efficiently
   scale in-flight instructions through a hybrid outof-order/in-order
   microarchitecture, which can dispatch instructions to efficient in-order
   scheduling mechanisms-using a FIFO issue queue called the shelf-on an
   instruction-by-instruction basis. Instructions dispatched to the shelf
   do not allocate out-of-order core resources in the reorder buffer, issue
   queue, physical registers, or load-store queues. We measure opportunity
   for such hybrid microarchitectures and design and evaluate a practical
   dispatch mechanism targeted at 4-threaded cores. Adding a shelf to a
   baseline 4-thread system with 64-entry ROB improves normalized system
   throughput by 11.5\% (up to 19.2\% at best) and energy-delay product by
   10.9\% (up to 17.5\% at best).}},

   solution for the military to meet a variety of changing mission demands

   effectiveness of the modularity solution. In this paper, we propose a
   functional synthesis method to design a set of modules comprising a
   modular ground vehicle fleet according to overall fleet-level
   objectives. We start with a functional decomposition of a baseline
   conventional fleet capable of performing a given fleet mission. We then
   formulate a functional synthesis problem to draw the boundaries that
   define modules for a modular fleet having the same mission capability
   with maximum fleet performance defined by average weight of the fleet
   performing the required operations and personnel time to reconfigure and
   maintain the fleet. An example problem is included to illustrate the
   approach. Results show a trade-off between two fleet-level objectives
   with respect to the degree of modularity.}},

Abstract = {{Speech contains patterns that can be altered by the mood of an
   individual. There is an increasing focus on automated and distributed
   methods to collect and monitor speech from large groups of patients
   suffering from mental health disorders. However, as the scope of these
   collections increases, the variability in the data also increases. This
   variability is due in part to the range in the quality of the devices,
   which in turn affects the quality of the recorded data, negatively
   impacting the accuracy of automatic assessment. It is necessary to
   mitigate variability effects in order to expand the impact of these
   technologies. This paper explores speech collected from phone recordings
   for analysis of mood in individuals with bipolar disorder. Two different
   phones with varying amounts of clipping, loudness, and noise are
   employed. We describe methodologies for use during preprocessing,
   feature extraction, and data modeling to correct these differences and
   make the devices more comparable. The results demonstrate that these
   pipeline modifications result in statistically significantly higher
   performance, which highlights the potential of distributed mental health

Abstract = {{Many modern datasets can be represented as graphs and hence spectral
   decompositions such as graph principal component analysis (PCA) can be
   useful. Distinct from previous graph decomposition approaches based on
   subspace projection of a single topological feature, e.g., the Fiedler
   vector of centered graph adjacency matrix (graph Laplacian), we propose
   spectral decomposition approaches to graph PCA and graph dictionary
   learning that integrate multiple features, including graph walk
   statistics, centrality measures and graph distances to reference nodes.
   In this paper we propose a new PCA method for single graph analysis,
   called multi-centrality graph PCA (MC-GPCA), and a new dictionary
   learning method for ensembles of graphs, called multi-centrality graph
   dictionary learning (MC-GDL), both based on spectral decomposition of
   multi-centrality matrices. As an application to cyber intrusion
   detection, MC-GPCA can be an effective indicator of anomalous
   connectivity pattern and MC-GDL can provide discriminative basis for
   attack classification.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion is expressed over both speech and song. Previous works have
   found that although spoken and sung emotion recognition are different
   tasks, they are related. Classifiers that explicitly utilize this
   relatedness can achieve better performance than classifiers that do not.
   Further, research in speech emotion recognition has demonstrated that
   emotion is more accurately modeled when gender is taken into account.
   However, it is not yet clear how domain (speech or song) and gender can
   be jointly leveraged in emotion recognition systems nor how systems
   leveraging this information can perform in cross-corpus settings. In
   this paper, we explore a multi-task emotion recognition framework and
   compare the performance across different classification models and
   output selection/fusion methods using cross-corpus evaluation. Our
   results show the classification accuracy is the highest when information
   is shared only between closely related tasks and when the output of
   disparate models are fused.}},

Abstract = {{High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker of
   epileptic brain tissue and activity. HFOs additionally serve as a
   prototypical example of challenges in the analysis of discrete events in
   high-temporal resolution, intracranial EEG data. Two primary challenges
   are 1) dimensionality reduction, and 2) assessing feasibility of
   classification. Dimensionality reduction assumes that the data lie on a
   manifold with dimension less than that of the features space. However,
   previous HFO analysis have assumed a linear manifold, global across
   time, space (i.e. recording electrode/channel), and individual patients.
   Instead, we assess both a) whether linear methods are appropriate and b)
   the consistency of the manifold across time, space, and patients. We
   also estimate bounds on the Bayes classification error to quantify the
   distinction between two classes of HFOs (those occurring during seizures
   and those occurring due to other processes). This analysis provides the
   foundation for future clinical use of HFO features and guides the
   analysis for other discrete events, such as individual action potentials
   or multi-unit activity.}},

   while satisfying the requirements of all passengers (e.g., travel time
