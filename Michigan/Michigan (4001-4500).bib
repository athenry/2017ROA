Abstract = {{In this paper, numerical simulations are performed for different
   configurations of plasmonic and dielectric scatters for the purpose of
   enhancing light absorption in Si solar cells. The numerical model is
   developed on the basis of FDTD solution of the transient Maxwell
   equations. Results show that for Ag nanoparticles, the optimal light
   absorption is achieved with a particle radius of 75 nm and particle
   spacing of 3r to 5r. For dielectric SiO2 nanoparticles, a closely packed
   configuration with particle size of 50 nm in radius yields the optimal
   light absorption. The enhancement for both optimal cases is similar,
   measured by the short currents. Simulations with SiO2 nanoparticles
   embedded into Si at various different positions were conducted and
   results suggest that when the SiO2 particle buried half-way into the Si
   substrate, the light absorption enhancement is better than that with the
   particles placed at the top or embedded completely inside the Si layer.
   Analysis of a new design, with Ag atop the surface of and SiO2 inside
   the Si layer, was also performed. The results suggest that such a
   combined configuration produces the best light absorption enhancement
   among all those studied, achieving an 80\% improvement compared with
   bare thin film.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is the design of a biaxial MEMS accelerometer
   for navigation applications. First, a survey is conducted to outline the
   commercial landscape of navigation-grade and MEMS accelerometers. The
   survey shows a potential market for navigation-grade accelerometers at
   the MEMS scale. Based on the specifications for navigation applications,
   the design targets are derived for the proposed biaxial MEMS
   accelerometers, including the common concerns of natural frequency
   ratios and bandwidth, as well as the important parameters for MEMS
   devices, such as hinge width, proof-mass size and mobility range. In
   light of the design targets, the ideal frequency matrix of the biaxial
   accelerometer system is derived based on the concept of generalized
   spring, in connection with the design targets. The stiffness values
   required are estimated herein. For further structural optimization, the
   parametric entries of the frequency-ratio matrix act as the objectives
   to be maximized for the lowest off axis sensitivity of the proposed
   accelerometer. A suitable architecture for MEMS biaxial accelerometers
   is proposed thereafter This architecture not only provides high
   compliance and structural isotropy for the in plane translation, but
   also allows for direct measurement of the proof-mass motion. The
   proposed architecture is then optimized for the highest frequency ratio
   between the non-sensitive and sensitive axes, with regard to the design
   parameters and constraints. The optimization results of the proposed
   accelerometer demonstrate navigation-grade mechanical performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a wet-based self-assembly process for
   nano-fabricating 1-D arrays of spherical nanoparticles and/or
   gold-nanoshells with controllable inter-particle distance for near
   infrared optical communications and for plasmon polariton waveguides
   featured with the lateral mode size below the optical diffraction limit.
   The process entails two main procedures. First, the SiO2 nanoparticle
   colloidal solution was restricted to flow through the gap between the
   patterned substrate and the cover slip, and the particles, trapped in
   the patterned, recessed regions, self-assembled to form closely arranged
   SiO2 particle arrays. These SiO2 particle arrays then acted as a
   template with which SiO2@Au nanoshell particle arrays of interest with
   desirable interparticle distance were obtained by repeating the above
   procedure with SiO2@Au dispersed solution. The needed high quality
   SiO2@Au core shell nanoparticles with tunable surface plasma resonance
   also were synthesized in our laboratory using the seed-and-grow method.
   Results show that, with this method, the interparticle distance of the
   nanoshell particle arrays can be controlled by a proper selection of the
   patterned groove and the sizes of SiO2 and SiO2@Au nanoshell particles.
   As demonstrated by experiment, the method is general and can be applied
   to Obtain nanoparticle particle arrays of other materials with
   controllable distance.}},

Abstract = {{Precise estimation of wall stress distribution within an abdominal
   aortic aneurysm (AAA) is clinically useful for prediction of its
   rupture. In this paper a computational fluid dynamic model incorporating
   two-way coupled fluid-structure interaction is employed to investigate
   the role of laminar turbulent flow transition and wall thickness in
   altering the distribution and magnitude of wall stress in an AAA. Blood
   flow in axially symmetric aneurysm models governed by a compliant wall
   mechanics was simulated. Menter's hybrid k-epsilon/k-omega shear stress
   transport (SST) model with a correlation-based transition model was used
   to capture laminar-turbulent transition in the blood flow. Realistic
   physiological transient boundary conditions were prescribed. The
   numerical model was validated against experimental data available from
   the literature. Fluid flow analysis showed the formation of
   recirculating vortices at the proximal end of the aneurysm after the
   peak systole which then, moved towards the distal end of the aneurysm
   along with the bulk flow and were dissipated eventually due to viscous
   effects. These vortices interacted with the aortic wall and led to local
   pressure rise. Von Mises stress distribution on the aneurysm wall and
   location of its peak value were computed and compared with those of a
   separate numerical simulation performed using a laminar viscous flow
   model. The predicted peak wall stress was found to be significantly
   higher for the SST model as compared to the laminar flow model. The
   location of maximum stress shifted more towards the posterior end of the
   aneurysm when laminar-turbulent flow transition was considered. In
   addition, a small reduction of 0.4 mm in wall thickness resulted in the
   elevation of peak wall stress by a factor of 1.4. The present study
   showed that capturing flow transition in an AAA is essential to accurate
   prediction of its rupture. The proposed numerical model provides a
   robust computational framework to gain more insight into AAA
   biomechanics and to accurately estimate wall stresses in realistic
   aneurysm configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced order models (ROMs) of turbine bladed disks (blisks) are
   essential to quickly yet accurately characterize vibration
   characteristics and effectively design for high cycle fatigue. Modeling
   blisks with contacting shrouds at adjacent blades is especially
   challenging due to friction damping and localized nonlinearities at the
   contact interfaces which can lead to complex stick-slip behavior: While
   well-known techniques such as the harmonic balance method and
   Craig-Bampton component mode synthesis have generally been employed to
   generate ROMs in the past, they do not reduce degrees of freedom (DoFs)
   at the interfaces themselves. In this paper we propose a novel method to
   obtain a set of reduction basis functions for the contact interface DoFs
   as well as the remaining DoFs called adaptive microslip projection
   (AMP). The method is based on analyzing a set of linear systems with
   specifically chosen boundary conditions on the contact interface.
   Simulated responses of full order baseline models and the novel ROMs
   under various conditions are studied. Results obtained from the ROMs
   compare very favor ably with the baseline model. The AMP procedure is
   also easily generalizable to other dynamic systems with Coulomb friction
   contacts.}},

Abstract = {{As a perhaps unintended consequence of their design, soft actuators
   typically store significant elastic energy as they expand under fluid
   pressure. Certain applications rely on a limited power budget. For
   example, we are interested in transmitting body power from a less
   impaired joint to assist in generating motions of an impaired joint.
   Thus stored elastic energy is not useful in our application. In this
   paper, we introduce the Origami Structured Compliant Actuator (OSCA), in
   which a fluid chamber is surrounded with rigid faces connected through
   hinges that guide the expansion of the chamber. The OSCA design ensures
   that no elastic energy is stored and expansion in off-axis directions is
   in fact converted to on-axis forces or torques. The OSCA design also
   features a kinematic singularity that gives rise to a significant
   mechanical advantage over certain ranges of motion. The typical
   advantages of soft actuators such as backdriveability, lightweight
   construction, and compatibility with a fluid transmission are preserved.
   We present the design of a bending actuator as an example of OSCA.
   Experimental results from prototypes support the model-based performance
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{In the previous study {[}1], an arm exoskeleton was proposed to be worn
   across the elbow joint of an amputee's residual limb using a pneumatic
   circuit. The pneumatic circuit provides not only the elastic element in
   a series elastic actuator (SEA), but also a flexible power transmission.
   The use of a customised cylinder on the off-grounded exoskeleton,
   however, imposes restrictions on the range of motion and reducing
   weight. In this study, a simple and light rotary pneumatic transmission
   is developed to be replaced with the cylinder. This device increases the
   range of motion. Also, control strategies for the pneumatic system is
   analyzed, focusing on compliance. Based on the positive effect of
   impedance control augmented with dynamics compensation on further
   reducing the driving-point impedance, an impedance controller for the
   system is proposed. The controller is model-free, robust, and simple to
   implement. A simulation study is provided to validate the efficacy of
   the impedance controller for the pneumatic circuit system for an elbow
   exoskeleton.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in manufacturing automotive lithium-ion
   batteries and battery packs is to achieve consistent weld quality in
   joining multiple layers of dissimilar materials. While most fusion
   welding processes face difficulties in such joining, ultrasonic welding
   stands out as the ideal method. However, inconsistency of weld quality
   still exists because of limited knowledge on the weld formation through
   the multiple interfaces. This study aims to establish real-time
   phenomenological observation on the multilayer ultrasonic welding
   process by analyzing the vibration behavior of metal layers. Such
   behavior is characterized by a direct measurement of the lateral
   displacement of each metal layer using high-speed images. Two different
   weld tools are used in order to investigate the effect of tool geometry
   on the weld formation mechanism and the overall joint quality. A series
   of microscopies and bond density measurements is carried out to validate
   the observations and hypotheses of those phenomena in multilayer
   ultrasonic welding. The results of this study enhance the understanding
   of the ultrasonic welding process of multiple metal sheets and provide
   insights for optimum tool design to improve the quality of multilayer

Abstract = {{In this work, friction stir welding (FSW) is used to produce butt joints
   of 3-mm-thick sheets of AZ31B magnesium alloy to two different aluminum
   alloys: AA1100 (minimum 99\% aluminum) and AA6061 (97.9\% Al). The paper
   reports on utilizing metallurgical techniques to determine the
   distribution profiles of elemental aluminum and magnesium within the
   joints were produced using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX).
   Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to identify the
   intermetallic compounds that form in the joints as a result of the
   stirring action at processing temperatures. Measurements confirmed the
   presence of primary intermetallic compounds in the welded joints and
   were identified to be the a-phase (Al12Mg17) and the beta-phase
   (Al3Mg2). Lastly, micro hardness studies were conducted at the
   intermetallic-compounds-rich locations resulting in hardness profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nanoparticles with controlled physical properties have been
   widely used for controlled release applications. In addition to shape,
   the anisotropic nature of the particles can be an important design
   criterion to ensure selective surface modification or independent
   release of combinations of drugs.
   Purpose: Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) co-jetting is used for the
   fabrication of uniform anisotropic nanoparticles with individual
   compartments and initial physicochemical and biological characterization
   is reported.
   Methods: EHD co-jetting is used to create nanoparticles, which are
   characterized at each stage with scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   structured illumination microscopy (SIM), dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Surface immobilization
   techniques are used to incorporate polyethylene glycol (PEG) and I 125
   radiolabels into the nanoparticles. Particles are injected in mice and
   the particle distribution after 1, 4 and 24 hours is assessed.
   Results and discussion: Nanoparticles with an average diameter of
   105.7nm are prepared by EHD co-jetting. The particles contain functional
   chemical groups for further surface modification and radiolabeling. The
   density of PEG molecules attached to the surface of nanoparticles is
   determined to range between 0.02 and 6.04 ligands per square nanometer.
   A significant fraction of the nanoparticles (1.2\% injected dose per
   mass of organ) circulates in the blood after 24 h.
   Conclusion: EHD co-jetting is a versatile method for the fabrication of
   nanoparticles for drug delivery. Circulation of the nanoparticles for 24
   h is a pre-requisite for subsequent studies to explore defined targeting
   of the nanoparticles to a specific anatomic site.}},

Abstract = {{Many cities face tremendous water-related challenges in this Century of
   the City. Urban areas are particularly susceptible not only to excesses
   and shortages of water but also to impaired water quality. Even moderate
   rainfall can quickly fill and overflow urban water courses. To addresses
   these challenges, we will over the coming 4 years synergistically
   integrate advances in computing and cyber-infrastructure, environmental
   modeling, geoscience, and information science to develop integrative
   solutions for urban water challenges that will change the way
   municipalities and stakeholders plan and manage their actions, resources
   and civil infrastructure for sustainable cities. We will develop a
   system empowered by distributed computing and cyber-infrastructure for
   integrative sensing, high-resolution modeling and uncertainty-assessed
   prediction of water quantity and quality for a large urban area. The
   resulting system will enable multi-scale and multi-dimensional
   risk-based decision making related to threats and risks associated with
   urban water to a wide spectrum of users and stakeholders, and advance
   general understanding of urban sustainability and associated challenges
   through environmental, social and economic response of a large city as
   an uncertain dynamic system to extreme precipitation, urbanization and
   climate change. This paper details this vision by providing a blueprint
   for the development of iSPUW: Integrated Sensing and Prediction of Urban
   Water for sustainable cities.}},

Abstract = {{Assembly line is widely used in manufacturing system and assembly line
   balancing problem directly affects the productivity of the whole
   manufacturing system. In the actual situation of assembly process,
   optimizing a certain goal in the process of actual assembly individually
   may cause the neglect of relevance of balance goals, so a dual-objective
   optimization model is proposed. Although there are many ways to solve
   the assembly line balancing problem, most of them have a slow
   convergence speed and poor optimize result. A PSOSA hybrid optimization
   algorithm is put forward to improve the solution quality. The Metropolis
   criterion of SA algorithm is integrated into PSO algorithm to overcome
   the precocious phenomenon of PSO and long optimization time of SA. So
   the PSOSA hybrid optimization algorithm has the advantages of PSO and SA
   algorithm. The simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness
   of the assembly line balancing optimization algorithm based on PSOSA

Abstract = {{Wound surface area changes over multiple weeks are highly predictive of
   the wound healing process. Furthermore, the quality and quantity of the
   tissue in the wound bed also offer important prognostic information.
   Unfortunately, accurate measurements of wound surface area changes are
   out of reach in the busy wound practice setting. Currently, clinicians
   estimate wound size by estimating wound width and length using a scalpel
   after wound treatment, which is highly inaccurate. To address this
   problem, we propose an integrated system to automatically segment wound
   regions and analyze wound conditions in wound images. Different from
   previous segmentation techniques which rely on hand-crafted features or
   unsupervised approaches, our proposed deep learning method jointly
   learns task-relevant visual features and performs wound segmentation.
   Moreover, learned features are applied to further analysis of wounds in
   two ways: infection detection and healing progress prediction. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to automate long-term
   predictions of general wound healing progress. Our method is
   computationally efficient and takes less than 5 seconds per wound image
   (480 by 640 pixels) on a typical laptop computer. Our evaluations on a
   large-scale wound database demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability
   of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability and death.
   Speed and accuracy are vital in diagnosing TBI for which computer-aided
   imaging analysis may speedup and improve the efficiency of diagnosis and
   help reduce mortality, long-term complications, and the associated
   costs. However, developing such a system is challenging due to some
   factors such as the inherent noise associated with obtaining the images,
   artifacts and quality of the images. An automated system that can
   preliminary identify, localize and quantify the imaging features of TBI
   would be beneficial in guiding real-time clinical diagnosis as well as
   for quality assurance. In this paper we propose an automated system to
   segment the hematoma region from CT images. The proposed method first
   performs denoising and image enhancement and then by developing a
   Gaussian mixture model, segmentation is carried out. We show the
   performance of the system by comparing the results with ground truth

Abstract = {{Inertial measurement units (IMU) are often used to estimate
   medial-lateral (M/L) trunk sway for assessing and treating gait
   disorders, and IMU sensor placement is an important factor effecting
   estimation accuracy. This study tracked multi-segment spine movements
   during standing and ambulation tasks to determine optimal IMU placement.
   Ten young healthy subjects, wearing markers placed along the spine,
   left/right acromion, and left/right posterior superior iliac spine
   performed standing and walking trials in a motion capture laboratory.
   Results showed that movement at the spine location T7-T8 most closely
   matched the clinical definition of M/L trunk sway for standing trials
   (0.5 deg error) and at the spine location T9-T10 for walking trials (1.0
   deg error), while movement at the lower spine L2-L4 tended to be the
   least accurate for standing and ambulation tasks (1.5 deg error and 4.0
   deg error, respectively). Based on these results, a second study was
   performed to develop and validate a trunk sway estimation algorithm
   during walking trials with a single optimally-placed IMU. IMU trunk sway
   estimation was compared to the clinical definition of trunk sway from
   motion capture markers and showed root-mean-square errors of 2.5 deg and
   peak trunk sway errors of 2.0 deg. The results of this study suggest
   that IMUs should be placed on the mid-back to reduce errors associated
   with spine movements not matching clinically-defined M/L trunk motion.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an optimal relay selection algorithm with non-negligible
   probing time is proposed and analyzed for cooperative wireless networks.
   Relay selection has been introduced to solve the degraded bandwidth
   efficiency problem in cooperative communication. Yet complete
   information of relay channels often remain unavailable for complex
   networks which renders the optimal selection strategies impossible for
   transmission source without probing the relay channels. Particularly
   when the number of relay candidate is large, even though probing all
   relay channels guarantees the finding of the best relays at any time
   instant, the degradation of bandwidth efficiency due to non-negligible
   probing times, which was often neglected in past literature, is also
   significant. In this work, a stopping rule based relay selection
   strategy is determined for the source node to decide when to stop the
   probing process and choose one of the probed relays to cooperate with
   under wireless channels' stochastic uncertainties. This relay selection
   strategy is further shown to have a simple threshold structure. At the
   meantime, full diversity order and high bandwidth efficiency can be
   achieved simultaneously. Both analytical and simulation results are
   provided to verify the claims.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous systems rely on an increasing number of input sensors of
   various modalities, and the problem of sensor fusion has received
   attention for many years. Autonomous system architectures are becoming
   more complex with time, and the number and placement of sensors will be
   modified regularly, sensors will fail for many reasons, information will
   arrive asynchronously, and the system will need to adjust to rapidly
   changing environments. To address these issues we propose a new paradigm
   for fusing information from multiple sources that draws from the rich of
   field pertaining to financial markets, particularly recent research on
   prediction market design. Among the many benefits of this financialized
   approach is that, both in theory and in practice, markets are
   well-equipped to robustly synthesize information from diverse sources in
   a decentralized fashion. Our framework poses sensor processing
   algorithms as profit-seeking market participants, data is incorporated
   via financial transactions, and the joint estimation is represented as a
   price equilibrium. We use pedestrian detection as a motivating
   application. Pedestrian detection is a well studied field and essential
   to autonomous driving. Real world fusion results are presented on RGB
   and LIDAR data from the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite. We demonstrate we
   can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art hand designed
   fusion techniques using the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{If the control authority of a running system is insufficient to reach a
   target state in a single step, i.e. if deadbeat control is not possible,
   then a stabilizing controller is faced with the decision on how to plan
   intermediate steps. In this work, we compare the performance of a simple
   greedy control policy (that computes deadbeat inputs and simply caps
   them) with the optimal performance found by an exhaustive search through
   decision space. The performance criterion used in this study is the
   basin of attraction: the set of all states from where the target state
   will be reached in a finite number of steps. Using the planar
   spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) as a model for a running robot,
   we compare the two control schemes and a fully passive behavior. To this
   end, we extended the passive slip model to include a controllable, yet
   limited variation of the touchdown angle and of the damping in the leg
   spring. We quantified the number of steps that it would take for the
   model to fall or converge from arbitrary initial states. The paper
   highlights how the passive stabilization, that is inherent to the SLIP
   model, greatly influences the dynamics of the controlled system.
   Furthermore, it reveals some new insights into the structure of basins
   of attractions of SLIP-like running models.}},

   of our proposed distance function is that it is also a control-Lyapunov
   function. We show that this allows us to construct feedback policies
   that stabilizes the system to a target pose, and to generate the optimal
   path that respects the non-holonomic constraints of the system via the
   non-holonomic RRT{*}. The composition of the Lyapunov function that is
   obtained as a result of this planning process provides stabilizing
   feedback and the cost-to-go to the final destination in the neighborhood

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel variable transmission system that is based
   on the concept of digital hydraulics. In the proposed system, sets of
   rolling-diaphragm cylinders are mounted via different effective lever
   arms to an input and output joint. A variable subset of these cylinders
   is connected via three-way two-position on/off valves to a common
   hydraulic manifold. This introduces a controllable constraint on the
   hydraulic flow and creates a programmable hydraulic transmission. With
   three single-acting cylinders, we could realize 37 different
   transmission ratios. We investigated the nonholonomic flow constraint
   analytically, in simulation, and with an experimental prototype. Using
   water as fluid, we show that a very stiff transmission (124.2 Nm/rad)
   can be achieved within the range of +/- 6 degrees. Theoretical
   transmission ratios are tracked with R-squared values of more than 0.996
   and backlash is smaller than 1.4\%. Furthermore, we show the
   applicability of the proposed transmission in the simulation of a
   body-powered knee-ankle exoskeleton.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of a human-following robot in which a human is
   equipped with a low-fidelity odometry sensor and a robot follows the
   human leader-often lagging well behind and out of visual contact with
   the human. The challenge is for the robot to determine the path taken by
   the human, despite the relatively noisy odometry data available. Such a
   system is useful in a ``pack mule{''} application, where the robot
   carries a heavy load for the human.
   Our key idea is to equip the robot with sensors allowing it to build a
   map, and to use observations of the environment structure to constrain
   the path of the human. We propose and evaluate several approaches: a
   particle filter method that extends monte-carlo localization approaches,
   and a multi-hypothesis maximum-likelihood approach based on stochastic
   gradient descent optimization that efficiently clusters similar
   trajectories. We demonstrate that our proposed approaches are able to
   track human trajectories in several synthetic and real-world datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Driver yawning detection is one of the key technologies used in driver
   fatigue monitoring systems. Real-time driver yawning detection is a very
   challenging problem due to the dynamics in driver's movements and
   lighting conditions. In this paper, we present a yawning detection
   system that consists of a face detector, a nose detector, a nose tracker
   and a yawning detector. Deep learning algorithms are developed for
   detecting driver face area and nose location. A nose tracking algorithm
   that combines Kalman filter with a dedicated open-source TLD
   (Track-Learning-Detection) tracker is developed to generate robust
   tracking results under dynamic driving conditions. Finally a neural
   network is developed for yawning detection based on the features
   including nose tracking confidence value, gradient features around
   corners of mouth and face motion features. Experiments are conducted on
   real-world driving data, and results show that the deep convolutional
   networks can generate a satisfactory classification result for detecting
   driver's face and nose when compared with other pattern classification
   methods, and the proposed yawning detection system is effective in
   real-time detection of driver's yawning states.}},

   asked to develop individual learning goals for the project, does that
   influence the activities that they engage in, and does articulating
   learning goals lead to a more beneficial project experience? We are
   using a mixed-methods approach to investigate the experiences of a small

Abstract = {{Students in an introductory science course offered both face-to-face and
   on-line at the University of Michigan used a web application that
   allowed them to respond to questions, pose questions and take notes. The
   data from their participation were recorded, quantified and compared
   with their resulting grades on exams to ascertain to what degree
   measures of student participation were related to student learning.
   These measures of student participation were augmented by data from the
   university's student information system, which provided background
   information. Data was also collected from a number of surveys
   administered over the semester. Analyses of the data revealed some
   strong relationships between grades and the degree and quality of
   student participation. Moreover the behavior of students varied
   significantly when stratified by their incoming GPA. The empirical
   relationships reported here provide evidence-based affirmation that
   student participation is related to learning and suggests that the
   strength of GPA as a predictor of grades may be due more to a lack the
   study skills and/or motivation rather than cognitive ability.}},

Abstract = {{Success within the distance learning paradigm typically requires a
   strong intrinsic motivation on the part of the learner. This motivation
   needs to be matched with effective delivery of engaging course content.
   Developing an active engagement environment for deep learning is a
   nontrivial task as the instructor is not physically present.
   To address the concern in an online/blended delivery model, we had
   developed and examined our first cyber classroom, in which lectures are
   automatically recorded and posted to a website for subsequent online
   consumption. The observed limitations of this approach were twofold: )1)
   online student participation in onground classroom activities was
   unfeasible; and )2) onground student collaborative activities were
   severely curtailed by the classroom layout.
   In this work in progress we present our revised concept grounded in
   active learning scientific principles combined with lessons learned from
   our prior approach. By leveraging classroom spatial layout best
   practices combined with the apropos technology, we seek to address the
   aforementioned two concerns. Specifically we present a description of
   our revised cyber classroom, along with plans for future application
   involving integrating online learning with the flipped classroom
   concept.}},

Abstract = {{The exceptional sensitivity of mammalian hearing organ is attributed to
   an outer hair cell-mediated active process, where forces produced by
   sensory cells boost sound-induced vibrations, making soft sounds
   audible. This process is thought to be local, with each section of the
   hearing organ capable of amplifying sound-evoked movement, and nearly
   instantaneous, since amplification can work for sounds at frequencies up
   to 100 kHz in some species. To test these precepts, we developed a
   method for focally stimulating the living hearing organ with light.
   Light pulses caused intense and highly damped mechanical responses
   followed by traveling waves that developed with considerable delay. The
   delayed response was identical to movements evoked by click-like sounds.
   A physiologically based mathematical model shows that such waves engage
   the active process, enhancing hearing sensitivity. The experiments and
   the theoretical analysis show that the active process is neither local
   nor instantaneous, but requires mechanical waves traveling from the
   cochlear base toward its apex.}},

Abstract = {{A completely implantable artificial organ of Corti (CIAO) was fabricated
   using batch MEMS processing techniques. A silicon backbone supports five
   piezoelectric cantilevers, each of which is designed to have an in vivo
   resonance corresponding to its tonotopic location in the guinea pig ST
   (20-40 kHz). An attachable polymer ribbon cable extends 4cm from the
   probe to an electrode bay, where electrical connections to each
   cantilever are accessed. The actuation responses of the fabricated
   devices were measured using laser vibrometry confirming the fluid-loaded
   resonance conforming to the straight section of the first turn of the
   guinea pig cochlea. First generation devices have been fabricated and
   the actuated resonances were measured to range from 80.3-134.2kHz in air
   and 24.3-41.0 kHz in water.}},

Abstract = {{Hearing relies on a series of coupled electrical, acoustical (fluidic)
   and mechanical interactions inside the cochlea that enable sound
   processing. A positive feedback mechanism within the cochlea, called the
   cochlear amplifier, provides amplitude and frequency selectivity in the
   mammalian auditory system. The cochlear amplifier and stability are
   studied using a nonlinear, micromechanical model of the Organ of Corti
   (OoC) coupled to the electrical potentials in the cochlear ducts. It is
   observed that the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) sensitivity and
   somatic motility of the outer hair cell (OHC), control the cochlear
   stability. Increasing MET sensitivity beyond a critical value, while
   electromechanical coupling coefficient is within a specific range,
   causes instability. We show that instability in this model is generated
   through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. A reduced order model of the
   system is approximated and it is shown that the tectorial membrane (TM)
   transverse mode effect on the dynamics is significant while the radial
   mode can be simplified from the equations. The cochlear amplifier in
   this model exhibits good agreement with the experimental data. A
   comprehensive 3-dimensional model based on the cross sectional model is
   simulated and the results are compared. It is indicated that the global
   model qualitatively inherits some characteristics of the local model,
   but the longitudinal coupling along the cochlea shifts the stability
   boundary (i.e., Hopf bifurcation point) and enhances stability.}},

   resonant meta-surface fabricated on a thin VO2 film integrated with a

   voltage to the heating electrodes we control the electromagnetic
   properties of the VO2 layer and shift the resonance frequency of the
   mata-surface, which results in a significant phase shift near the
   resonance frequency. Using the presented phase modulator design, we
   experimentally demonstrate the highest reported phase modulation of 60
   degrees at 85 GHz through a fully-integrated voltage-controlled device

Abstract = {{All-directions through the wall radar imaging method can be effectively
   employed to obtain accurate maps of buildings' interiors in a short time
   period. In this method, multiple reflections from surrounding walls
   produce spurious images and as a result, adversely affect the quality of
   the final image. In addition, to provide 360 degrees view of the imaging
   area, receivers utilize omnidirectional antennas that may result in
   saturation of receivers due to receiving high power direct signal from
   transmitter. This paper addresses these two issues in all-directions
   through the wall radar imaging. To avoid saturation of receivers by
   direct signal from transmitter and remove even number of reflections
   from walls, two different orthogonal circular polarizations are used for
   transmitting antenna and receiving antennas. Moreover, a new method
   based on generalized pencil of function (GPOF) method is introduced to
   determine the locations of the reflections with respect to transmitter
   and receivers positions. This method improves range resolution in the
   final image.}},

   antenna is utilized. A vertically oriented meander line scheme is
   employed to obtain high reconfigurability. By changing the strain, the

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of
   the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite relaxation globally
   solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for
   which the semidefinite relaxation fails to yield the global solution.
   Conditions for the success or failure of the semidefinite relaxation are
   valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a
   given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply
   to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of
   the semidefinite relaxation can be related to physical characteristics
   of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent
   formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions
   cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The semidefinite
   relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global
   solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent
   the same system, success (or otherwise) of the semidefinite relaxation
   must involve factors beyond just the network physics.}},

   visualizing the power flow feasibility boundary of large networks
   composed of (1) saddle-node bifurcation manifolds where the Jacobian is
   singular and (2) limit-induced bifurcation manifolds where the network
   loses structural stability as the limit is encountered. This method is
   applied to the DTE/ITC system in Eastern Michigan where significant wind
   development has taken place at both transmission (120-345kV) and
   subtransmission (42kV) levels. It is shown that reactive compensation
   capability of subtransmission wind farms, in voltage control mode, can
   shrink the feasibility boundary and hence negatively impact the voltage
   stability margin of the system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the game-theory-based market clearing mechanisms for
   an open and transactive distribution grid. Driven by the Smart Grid
   paradigm shift, hundreds of thousands of distributed electricity
   prosumers have the potential to participate into the residential
   electricity market by managing their own generators and loads.
   Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish an efficient and
   effective market framework for plug-and-play of a tremendous amount of
   highly distributed and scalable electricity prosumers. In this paper,
   the novel game-theory-based methodologies and algorithms are utilized to
   mimic the dynamic behaviors of these distributed electricity prosumers.
   The concept of Distribution Locational Marginal Price (DLMP) is also
   adopted to provide tempo-spatial price signals to all market
   participants. A suite of case studies are conducted to evaluate and
   validate the proposed electricity market clearing mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, attitude control of an underactuated spacecraft with two
   control moments is considered. Both the case of two external moments,
   that can, for instance, be applied by thrusters or two internal moments,
   that can, for instance, be applied by reaction wheels, are treated. Both
   problems are known to be challenging, e.g., there exists no smooth or
   even continuous time-invariant stabilizing feedback law in either of
   these cases. Our controller is based on a hybrid switching feedback law
   that exploits an inner-loop controller and an outer-loop controller. The
   fast inner loop controller tracks periodic reference trajectories while
   parameters which determine the amplitude of these reference trajectories
   are adjusted by an outer-loop controller. We demonstrate through
   simulations on a nonlinear spacecraft attitude dynamics model that this
   switching feedback law successfully accomplishes rest to-rest
   reorientation maneuvers, even in the presence of solar radiation
   pressure disturbance moments or in the case of nonzero total angular
   momentum.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we use optimal control on a geared electric DC motor to
   compare the energetic efficiency of a simulation of conceptual monoped
   hoppers with either parallel elastic actuation (PEA) or series elastic
   actuation (SEA). The energy is measured using three cost functions:
   positive actuator work, electrical losses, and positive electrical work.
   For PEA, the presence of the motor inertia in the collision losses leads
   to increased collision losses at large transmission ratios, which lead
   to energetically costly compensatory strategies where the SEA is at its
   most efficient. At small transmission ratios, the motor force increases
   for both cases, leading to increased thermal losses. In agreement with
   those theoretical predictions, our work shows that for positive actuator
   work and positive electrical work the optimal parameter choice for SEA
   is significantly more energetically efficient than the optimal choice
   for PEA. For electrical losses, a suitable choice of the transmission
   ratio can lead to negligible cost values for both actuator concepts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a fast multiresolution scan matcher for vehicle
   localization in urban environments for self-driving cars.
   State-of-the-art approaches to vehicle localization rely on observing
   road surface reflectivity with a three-dimensional (3D) light detection
   and ranging (LIDAR) scanner to achieve centimeter-level accuracy.
   However, these approaches can often fail when faced with adverse weather
   conditions that obscure the view of the road paint (e. g., puddles and
   snowdrifts) or poor road surface texture. We propose a new scan matching
   algorithm that leverages Gaussian mixture maps to exploit the structure
   in the environment; these maps are a collection of Gaussian mixtures
   over the z-height distribution. We achieve real-time performance by
   developing a novel branch-and-bound, multiresolution approach that makes
   use of rasterized lookup tables of these Gaussian mixtures. Results are
   shown on two datasets that are 3.0 k m : a standard trajectory and
   another under adverse weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a method to perform robust visual relocalization
   between temporally separated sets of underwater images gathered by a
   robot. The place recognition and relocalization problem is more
   challenging in the underwater environment mainly due to three factors:
   1) changes in illumination; 2) long-term changes in the visual
   appearance of features because of phenomena like biofouling on man-made
   structures and growth or movement in natural features; and 3) low
   density of visually salient features for image matching. To address
   these challenges, a patch-based feature matching approach is proposed,
   which uses image segmentation and local intensity contrast to locate
   salient patches and HOG description to make correspondences between
   patches. Compared to traditional point-based features that are sensitive
   to dramatic appearance changes underwater, patch-based features are able
   to encode higher level information such as shape or structure which
   tends to persist across years in underwater environments. The algorithm
   is evaluated on real data, from multiple years, collected by a Hovering
   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for ship hull inspection. Results in
   relocalization performance across missions from different years are
   compared to other traditional methods.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new multi-resolution scan matching method that makes
   exhaustive (and thus local-minimum-proof) matching practical, even for
   large positional uncertainties. Unlike earlier multi-resolution methods,
   in which putative matches at low-resolutions can lead the matcher to an
   incorrect solution, our method generates exactly the same answer as a
   brute-force full-resolution method. We provide a proof of this. Novelly,
   our method allows decimation of both the look-up table and in the point
   cloud, yielding a 10x speedup versus contemporary correlative methods.
   When a robot closes a large-scale loop, it must often consider many
   loop-closure candidates. In this paper, we describe an approach for
   posing a scan matching query over these candidates jointly, finding the
   best match(es) between a particular pose and a set of candidate poses
   ({''}one-to-many{''}), or the best match between two sets of poses
   ({''}many-to-many{''}). This mode of operation finds the first loop
   closure as much as 45x faster than traditional ``one-to-one{''} scan
   matching.}},

Abstract = {{Having human-like motions will make humanoid robots more predictable and
   safer for the people around them. An effective way to realize this would
   be to use human motions as reference. Due to different kinematic and
   dynamic properties between humans and humanoid robots, however, a human
   motion could be physically infeasible for a robot and cause the robot to
   fall over. Therefore, it is necessary to modify and adapt an infeasible
   human motion to the robot. This paper presents a method for adapting
   human motions to humanoid robots based on a technique called time
   warping, which modifies the time line of a reference motion to speed up
   or slow down the motion. By doing this, the velocity and acceleration
   profiles of the motion are changed and it is possible to turn an
   infeasible motion into a feasible one. The optimal time warping is
   obtained through a generalized motion feasibility index that quantifies
   the feasibility of a motion considering the friction and
   center-of-pressure constraints. Thanks to the generality of the index,
   the proposed motion adaptation method can be applied to motions on
   arbitrary terrains or number of links in contact with the environment.
   Through dynamics simulation, we demonstrate that the method facilitates
   the reproduction of human motions on a humanoid robot.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new multiphase phase interleaved three-level
   neutral point clamped (NPC) buck converter. Compared to the conventional
   three phase buck, this new topology allows to split the output current
   between two inductors, increasing the energy density and thus reducing
   the inductor size. Furthermore, the output voltage and current ripple
   can be significantly reduced and the ripple frequency is fourth times
   the switching one, allowing to employee a smaller output capacitance.
   The operating modes and switching intervals of the proposed topology are
   presented and discussed. A simulation model of the converter has been
   developed in the standalone PLECS tool, including conduction and
   switching loss models, based on commercial silicon carbide power
   devices. Extensive simulation have been performed in order to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposal and to highlight the specific features of
   this converter, mainly phase and output current ripple reduction, nested
   current/voltage control scheme and current sampling issues, losses and
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric energy harvesters generate electrical power from ambient
   mechanical vibrations, making these vibrations a viable energy source
   for powering wireless sensor and identifier nodes. In order to harvest
   an appreciable amount of power, piezoelectric devices are typically
   inserted into high-Q mechanical resonant structures that significantly
   limit their harvesting bandwidth. Recently, active dynamic energy
   harvesting techniques have been proposed as a way to widen the bandwidth
   of resonant piezoelectric energy harvesters; however, a practical
   stand-alone design has not yet been demonstrated. This paper describes a
   new resonant inverter topology that implements the dynamic active energy
   harvesting technique. Experimental results using the Mide Volture V20w
   piezoelectric device show that over the applied frequency band, this
   system harvests up to 7.7 times more power at off-resonant frequencies
   and twice as much power near the resonant frequency when compared to an
   adaptive rectifier circuit. These results occur while including
   previously ignored loss mechanisms such as control losses, gating
   losses, and phase detection losses, and demonstrate the feasibility of a
   stand-alone system.}},

   Function-Based Quadratic Programs}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{323-332}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method to address the actuator saturation
   for nonlinear hybrid systems by directly incorporating user-defined
   input bounds in a controller design. In particular, we consider the
   application of bipedal walking and show that our method {[}based on a
   quadratic programming (QP) implementation of a control Lyapunov function
   (CLF)-based controller] enables a gradual performance degradation while
   still continuing to walk under increasingly stringent input bounds. We
   draw on our previous work, which has demonstrated the effectiveness of
   the CLF-based controllers for stabilizing periodic gaits for biped
   walkers. This paper presents a framework, which results in more
   effective handling of control saturations and provides a means for
   incorporating a whole family of user-defined constraints into the online
   computation of a CLF-based controller. This paper concludes with an
   experimental validation of the main results on the bipedal robot MABEL,
   demonstrating the usefulness of the QP-based CLF approach for real-time
   robotic control.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing complexity of modern digital circuits has exacerbated the
   challenge of verifying the functionality of these systems. To further
   compound the issue, shrinking time-to-market constraints place increased
   pressure on attaining correct devices in short amounts of time. As a
   result, more and more of the burden of validation has shifted to the
   post-silicon stage, when the first silicon prototypes of a design become
   available. This validation phase brings much faster test execution
   speeds, at the cost of a very limited ability of diagnosing bugs. To
   further compound the problem, intermittent failures are not uncommon,
   due to the physical nature of the device under validation. In this work
   we propose ItHELPS, a solution to identify the timing of a bug
   manifestation and the root signals responsible for it in industry-size
   complex digital designs. We employ a synergistic approach based on a
   machine-learning solution (DBSCAN) paired with an adaptive refinement
   analysis, capable of narrowing the location of a failure down to a
   handful of signals, possibly buried deep within the design hierarchy. We
   find experimentally that our approach outperforms the accuracy of prior
   state-of-the-art solutions by two orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) uses standard logic to process pseudo-random
   bit-streams denoting probabilities. It implements arithmetic operations
   by extremely simple and low-power hardware. Despite major new
   applications, SC's theory and design requirements are poorly understood.
   We observe that the Boolean functions used in SC take the form f(X) =
   f(X-V; X-C), where X-V and X-C are inputs with variable and constant
   probabilities, respectively. Different functions can be equivalent in
   the sense of implying the same stochastic behavior. We define stochastic
   equivalence classes (SECs), and investigate their properties and
   applications. Suitably interpreted, SECs describe all realizable
   arithmetic functions of interest. While conventional synthesis focuses
   on finding the best circuit to implement a known function, stochastic
   circuit optimization first requires finding the best function. We
   present an SEC-based approach to this problem, which demonstrates the
   computational richness of SC and leads to significant cost reductions
   compared to prior designs.}},

Abstract = {{We give a short overview of stochastic computing (SC) and its uses. SC
   computes with randomized bit-streams that loosely resemble the neural
   spike trains of the brain. Its key feature is the use of low-cost and
   low-power logic elements to implement complex numerical operations in a
   highly error-tolerant fashion. These advantages must be weighed against
   SC's inherently slow computing speed and low precision. Although studied
   sporadically since its invention in the 1960s, SC has regained interest
   recently as potentially suited to some emerging nanotechnologies, and to
   applications such as ECC decoding and biomedical image processing.
   However, a number of major challenges must be overcome if this potential
   is to be fully realized.}},

Abstract = {{Compact battery pack design and cooling requirements present significant
   challenges for the placement of temperature sensors. Typically,
   temperature sensors are located near the edge of the battery, and away
   from the hottest regions, which leads to slower response times and
   increased errors in the prediction of interior cell temperature. New
   sensor technology allows for sensor placement between cells to improve
   sensor performance. With the ability to place sensors anywhere on the
   exterior of the cell, an observability analysis is necessary to
   determine the optimal locations for these sensors. The analysis is
   performed using a spatial discretization of a validated electrothermal
   model. This model describes a 5 Ah Li-ion cell harvested from a Ford
   C-max 2013 pack. Given that the spatial discretization of the heat
   partial differential equation (PDE) governing the system results in
   singular values that are very small (numerically zero), two methods are
   presented in this paper to quantify observability and address the issue
   of optimal sensor placement. The optimal sensor placement between cells
   yields a 240\% improvement (for 3 sensors on the surface) and 15\%
   improvement (for one sensor on the surface) in observability over
   existing sensor placement near the top edge of the cell. The pack
   geometry and airflow conditions impact sensor placement. It is
   preferable to place the sensors towards the outlet side of the airflow
   as opposed to the inlet side, resulting in a 13\% improvement in
   observability.}},

Abstract = {{Opacity is a confidentiality property for partially-observed
   discrete-event systems relevant to the analysis of security and privacy
   in cyber and cyber-physical systems. It captures the plausible
   deniability of the system's ``secret{''} in the presence of an outside
   observer that is potentially malicious. In this paper, we consider the
   enforcement of opacity on systems modeled by finite-state automata. We
   assume that the given system is not opaque and the objective is to
   restrict its behavior by supervisory control in order to enforce opacity
   of its secret. We consider the general setting of supervisory control
   under partial observations where the controllable events need not all be
   observable. Our approach for the synthesis of an opacity enforcing
   supervisor is based on the construction of a new transition system that
   we call the ``All Inclusive Controller for Opacity{''} (or AIC-O). The
   AIC-O is a finite bipartite transition system that embeds in its
   transition structure all valid opacity enforcing supervisors. We present
   an algorithm for the construction of the AIC-O and discuss its
   properties. We then develop a synthesis algorithm, based on the AICO,
   that constructs a ``maximally permissive{''} opacity-enforcing
   supervisor. Our approach generalizes previous approaches in the
   literature for opacity enforcement by supervisory control.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the relationship between the problem of decentralized
   fault diagnosis and the problem of decentralized control of discrete
   event systems under dynamic observations. The key system-theoretic
   properties that arise in these problems are those of codiagnosability
   and coobservability, respectively. It was shown by Wang et al. in {[}1]
   that coobservability is transformable to codiagnosability; however, the
   transformation for the other direction has remained an open problem. In
   this paper, we consider a general language-based dynamic observations
   setting and show how the notion of K-codiagnosability can be transformed
   to coobservability. Moreover, we show that, when the observation map is
   static, the standard notion of centralized diagnosability is
   transformable to observability. Our results thereby complement those in
   {[}1] and provide a better understanding of the relationship between the
   notions of codiagnosability and coobservability. In particular, our new
   results allow the leveraging of the large existing literature on
   decentralized control synthesis to solve problems of decentralized fault

   control to follow step, ramp, and harmonic roll-angle commands for a
   linearized aircraft model with an unknown transition from minimum-phase

   retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC) with 1) a
   command-feed-forward control architecture; 2) an output-feedback control
   architecture; 3) a centralized control architecture that uses both
   command feedforward and output feedback; and 4) a decentralized control
   architecture that uses both command feedforward and output feedback. For
   baseline tests, we assume that the location of the NMP zero is known.
   The goal of this work is to improve the transient response and rate of
   convergence. Numerical testing shows that RCAC with the decentralized
   control architecture using command feedforward and output feedback gives
   the fastest convergence. Furthermore, resetting controller coefficients
   at the start of the transition improves the transient response.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in automotive technology, such as, sensing and onboard
   computation, have resulted in the development of adaptive cruise control
   (ACC) algorithms that improve both comfort and safety. With a view
   towards developing advanced controllers for ACC, this paper presents an
   experimental platform for validation and demonstration of an online
   optimization based controller. Going beyond traditional PID based
   controllers for ACC that lack proof of safety, we construct a control
   framework that gives formal guarantees of correctness. In particular,
   safety constraints-maintaining a valid following distance from a lead
   car-are represented by control barrier functions (CBFs), and control
   objectives-achieving a desired speed-are encoded through control
   Lyapunov functions (CLFs). These different objectives can be unified
   through a quadtraic program (QP), with constraints dictated by CBFs and
   CLFs, that balances safety and the control objectives in an optimal
   fashion. This methodology is demonstrated on scale-model cars, for which
   the CBF-CLF based controller is implemented online, with the end result
   being the experimental validation of an advanced adaptive cruise
   controller.}},

Abstract = {{In traditional system designs for feedback structural control systems,
   the structure is assumed to be linear time invariant (LTI). However,
   extreme load events on the structure can damage the structure leading to
   violation of the time invariance assumption. This study proposes an
   online adaptive control strategy that tracks the time varying
   characteristics of a structural system with the optimal control law
   recursively derived for the system. Continuous system identification
   executed concurrently with derivation of optimal control laws is
   possible using the low-power, dual-core Martlet wireless node developed
   at the University of Michigan. The wireless platform executes online
   system identification recursively on one processor pipeline while a
   control law based on linear quadratic regulation (LQR) is derived and
   implemented concurrently on the second pipeline. By parallelizing the
   implementation of the LQR control law and system identification
   algorithm, the wireless sensing network is shown to be capable of
   learning and adapting to system changes in real-time. Simulation and
   experiments on a 4 story benchmark shear structure is utilized to show
   the validity and scalability of the proposed adaptive feedback control
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work framed the battery State of Health (SoH) monitoring
   problem as an inaccessible subsystem identification problem and
   conceived an approach to monitor SoH via side reaction current density
   estimation when State of Charge (SoC) is perfectly known. In practice,
   however, SoC is only estimated, and even an SoC estimation error of less
   than 1\% can significantly undermine the accuracy of the SoH estimation.
   In this paper, the development of a new inaccessible subsystem
   identification technique, called the Two Step Filter, is presented in a
   linear setting to estimate the SoC error and SoH variable simultaneously
   and hence allow for SoH monitoring even under SoC estimation errors. The
   potential of the Two Step Filter is demonstrated on a linearized battery
   model example. The result shows that the filter can successfully track
   the side reaction current density despite the presence of an SoC
   estimation error of 1\%.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy for simultaneous
   station keeping and momentum management of a low-thrust nadir-pointing
   satellite in geostationary orbit around the Earth. The satellite is
   equipped with six electrically powered thrusters and three axisymmetric
   reaction wheels, which must be coordinated to control the satellite's
   orbital position and, concurrently, unload the wheels' stored angular
   momentum. The MPC policy enforces constraints that maintain the
   satellite in a tight latitude and longitude window and in a tight
   nadir-pointing attitude configuration, while minimizing the delta-v
   provided by the thrusters. The MPC policy exploits a prediction model of
   the environmental disturbance forces in order to significantly reduce
   the delta-v required for station keeping, and enforces constraints
   determined by the thruster configuration to select control forces and
   torques that can be generated by the propulsion system. We present
   numerical simulations of the control policy in closed-loop with the
   satellite nonlinear dynamics that validate the performance of the
   proposed design in terms of thruster usage and constraint enforcement.}},

Abstract = {{Two methods for torsional resonance mitigation are tested using the NREL
   software FAST in the MATLAB/Simulink environment with a 750 kW wind
   turbine. One mitigation method uses rotor angular acceleration
   measurements to provide virtual inertia for resonance detuning while the
   other is an active vibration absorber. The wind turbine representation
   uses a five mass gearbox model, a doubly fed induction generator model,
   an interface with the power grid, and an aerodynamic simulation of the
   tower shadow effect. The two mitigation methods are tested by subjecting
   the wind turbine to a frequency scan of wind in order to excite the
   resonant conditions and then to examine the influence of the mitigation
   methods. The vibration absorber shows better performance with greater
   shaft oscillation reduction than that of the virtual inertia. This is a
   continuation of an earlier study where a permanent magnet synchronous
   generator was included in the turbine model and no grid connection was
   present. The implementation of the vibration absorber includes a novel
   means of generator torque control for doubly fed induction generators.}},

   introduce stochastic delays into the communication channels that make

   we demonstrate that how the stable regimes shrink when the sampling time

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate effects of communication delays on the
   nonlinear dynamics of connected vehicle systems. Our modeling framework
   incorporates communication delays, which arise from the intermittency
   and packet drops in wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Plant
   stability and string stability are used to characterize the system-level
   performance of vehicle networks. Delay-dependent stability conditions
   are derived based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem and then visualized
   by using stability diagrams. Numerical simulations are used to validate
   the stability diagrams and to demonstrate that bistability can be
   avoided by utilizing the nonlinear stability analysis presented in this
   paper.}},

   mode is a nominal mode in which the system has high efficiency and
   performance but in which the constraint violation is more likely. The
   second mode is the safe mode in which the performance/efficiency is
   lower but the constraint violation is less likely. For such systems
   approaches for predicting the risk of constraint violation based on
   linear and nonlinear discrete-time system models and disturbance
   scenarios based on steps and fluctuation near a constant values are
   described. Two examples of a mass spring damper system (linear system)
   and of an engine (nonlinear system) are presented in which the risk
   calculation is exploited to define the logic for activating the safe
   mode. Simulation results are reported.}},

Abstract = {{An auction-based game is formulated for coordinating the charging of a
   population of electric vehicles (EVs) over a finite horizon. The
   proposed auction requires individual EVs to submit bid profiles that
   have dimension equal to two times the number of time-steps in the
   horizon. They compete for energy allocation at each time-step. Use of
   the progressive second price (PSP) auction mechanism ensures that
   incentive compatibility holds for the auction game. However, due to
   cross-elasticity between the charging time-steps, the marginal valuation
   of an individual EV at a particular time is determined by both the
   demand at that time and the total demand over the entire horizon. This
   difficulty is addressed by partitioning the allowable set of bid
   profiles according to the total desired energy over the entire horizon.
   It is shown that the efficient bid profile over the charging horizon is
   a Nash equilibrium of the underlying auction game. A dynamic update
   mechanism for the auction game is designed. A numerical example
   demonstrates that the auction system converges to the efficient Nash
   equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{How can a building Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC) system
   vary its real time power consumption to provide ancillary services to
   the power grid without sacrificing occupant comfort? Prior work showed
   how this can be done if the reference power variation is of high
   frequency (seconds to a few minutes) so that the climate control system
   filters out the disturbance. This paper addresses the question of how to
   do that when the reference power variation is of lower frequency, e. g.,
   periods of a few minutes to an hour. We propose a receding horizon
   approach to schedule the baseline cooling and heating power of a
   building based on weather forecasts. A lower level controller is then
   used to track the scheduled baseline plus ancillary service reference
   signal. Periodic updates to the scheduler based on measurements ensure
   quality of service in spite of forecasting errors. The algorithm is
   tested in simulation. Results show that ancillary service in the
   frequency range of f is an element of {[}1/(1 hour), 1/(10 minutes)] can
   be extracted from commercial building HVAC systems while still
   maintaining a comfortable indoor climate.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregations of electric loads, like heating and cooling systems, can be
   controlled to help the power grid balance supply and demand, but the
   amount of balancing reserves available from these resources is
   uncertain. In this paper, we investigate data-driven optimization
   methods that are suited to dispatching power systems with uncertain
   balancing reserves provided by load control. Specifically, we consider a
   chance-constrained optimal power flow problem in which we aim to satisfy
   constraints that include random variables either jointly with a
   specified probability or individually with different risk tolerance
   levels. We focus on the realistic case in which we do not have full
   knowledge of the uncertainty distributions and compare distribution-free
   approaches with several stochastic optimization methods. We conduct
   experimental studies on the IEEE 9-bus test system assuming uncertainty
   in load, load-control reserve capacities, and renewable energy
   generation. The results show the computational efficacy of the
   distributionally robust approach and its flexibility in trading off
   between cost and robustness of solutions driven by data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method of recovering linear controllability of an
   underactuated spacecraft by accounting for the effects of solar
   radiation pressure (SRP) in the spacecraft attitude dynamics model. The
   developments are based on a spacecraft model with a four wheel reaction
   wheel array of which two wheels have failed and two wheels are
   functioning. The model for SRP torque as a function of spacecraft
   attitude is incorporated into the state-space description of the system.
   Under suitable assumptions, the linearization of the underacted
   spacecraft model (with SRP effects included) is shown to be linearly
   controllable. This conclusion is exploited to define a novel approach
   for handling reaction wheel failures based on conventional Linear
   Quadratic (LQ) controllers. The results of the linear and non-linear
   simulations illustrate the ability to recover pointing by controlling
   two functioning reaction wheels while two other wheels undergo
   subsequent failures.}},

   presents a simultaneous identification and adaptive control design

Abstract = {{This paper considers a path planning problem with two marsupial vehicles
   (one carrier vehicle and one passenger vehicle that is deployed by the
   carrier vehicle) exploring a planar area. This work is motivated by
   multiagent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions in
   contested environments. The vehicles are heterogeneous, e.g., the
   carrier vehicle is faster than the passenger vehicle or the passenger
   vehicle possesses better sensors than the carrier vehicle. The vehicles
   are to gather a finite amount of information about an object of interest
   using their sensors while minimizing the likelihood of their detection
   by an opponent. Necessary conditions for optimal solutions are given and
   straight line travel for both vehicles is shown to be optimal. The
   results are illustrated in several simulation examples.}},

Abstract = {{High-performance position control algorithms for multi-axis
   servo-systems, due to presence of asymmetric dynamics and disturbance,
   do not guarantee high-precision contouring. Cross-Coupling Control (CCC)
   conventionally uses a static Contour Error Estimate (CEE) to reduce the
   shortest distance between the reference map and actual position, known
   as contour error. However, reliability of the static CEE deteriorates
   for high-speed reference feeds and also for sharp corners and deep
   curves. We propose a dynamic CEE using a Newton-based update law to
   obtain a precise CEE for fast and highly-curved contours. The
   Newton-based algorithm uses an estimate of the contour error curvature
   in order to eliminate the convergence dependence on the contour shape.
   The proposed CCC design includes one PID controller per axis, and
   combines the proposed Newton-based CEE with Integral Sliding Mode
   Control (ISMC) which is well-known for its capability in dealing with
   parameter uncertainty and external disturbances. The proposed ISMC
   performance is enhanced with an adaptive disturbance estimate. The
   proposed CCC algorithm reduces the time-averaged contour error (TACE) at
   least by an order of magnitude in comparison to conventional CCC
   algorithms. Various simulation results are presented to highlight the
   significant improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for the development of control barrier
   functions (CBFs) through a backstepping inspired approach. Given a set
   defined as the superlevel set of a function, h, the main result is a
   constructive means for generating control barrier functions that
   guarantee forward invariance of this set. In particular, if the function
   defining the set has relative degree n, an iterative methodology
   utilizing higher order derivatives of h provably results in a control
   barrier function that can be explicitly derived. To demonstrate these
   formal results, they are applied in the context of bipedal robotic
   walking. Physical constraints, e.g., joint limits, are represented by
   control barrier functions and unified with control objectives expressed
   through control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) via quadratic program (QP)
   based controllers. The end result is the generation of stable walking
   satisfying physical realizability constraints for a model of the bipedal
   robot AMBER2.}},

Abstract = {{By performing stability analysis on an optimal runway schedule, this
   paper derives a method to determine whether the landing sequence of
   aircraft remains optimal after an arbitrary number of aircraft in that
   sequence are delayed by an arbitrary amount of time. We consider the
   problem of scheduling aircraft landing on a single runway such that the
   runway throughput is maximized under changing external conditions such
   as delays caused by for example weather. Instead of optimizing the
   schedule every time delays occur, stability criteria allow for fast
   evaluation of whether schedules remain optimal. This paper develops a
   method to compute stability regions for a set of schedules. Sensitivity
   analysis of the linear programming relaxation and a nonlinear
   relationship between the delay of individual aircraft and the incurred
   cost change of any potential landing sequence yield the desired
   stability information. Furthermore, the properties of a greedy first
   come first serve policy are studied by giving sufficient conditions to
   determine whether first come first serve is optimal.}},

Abstract = {{Models of bipedal locomotion are hybrid, with a continuous component
   often generated by a Lagrangian plus actuators, and a discrete component
   where leg transfer takes place. The discrete component typically
   consists of a locally embedded co-dimension one submanifold in the
   continuous state space of the robot, called the switching surface, and a
   reset map that provides a new initial condition when a solution of the
   continuous component intersects the switching surface. The aim of this
   paper is to identify a low-dimensional submanifold of the switching
   surface, which, when it can be rendered invariant by the closed-loop
   dynamics, leads to asymptotically stable periodic gaits. The paper
   begins this process by studying the well-known 3D Linear Inverted
   Pendulum (LIP) model, where analytical results are much easier to
   obtain. A key contribution here is the notion of self-synchronization,
   which refers to the periods of the pendular motions in the sagittal and
   frontal planes tending to a common period. The notion of invariance
   resulting from the study of the 3D LIP model is then extended to a 9-DOF
   3D biped. A numerical study is performed to illustrate that
   asymptotically stable walking may be obtained.}},

   efficient way of improving the tracking performance of repetitive

   Utilizing abstract Banach spaces as our problem setting, we develop a
   general approach that is applicable to the various frameworks
   encountered in ILC. Our main result is that robust invariant update laws
   lead to stable behavior in ILC systems, where iteration varying systems
   converge to bounded neighborhoods of their nominal counterparts when
   uncertainties are bounded. Furthermore, if the uncertainties are
   convergent along the iteration axis, convergence to the nominal case can

Abstract = {{Ship propulsion systems experience large power and torque fluctuations
   on their drive shaft due to hydrodynamic interactions and wave
   excitation. For electric propulsions, a hybrid energy storage system
   (HESS) could be an effective solution to address the negative impact of
   these fluctuations. However, the HESS, when introduced into the existing
   shipboard electrical propulsion system, will interact with the power
   generation control systems. In this paper, a model-based analysis is
   performed to evaluate the interactions of the multiple power sources
   when a hybrid energy storage system is incorporated. The study has
   revealed undesirable interactions when the controls are not coordinated
   properly, and leads to the conclusion that a system-level energy
   management strategy (EMS) will be needed. To evaluate the benefits of
   the system-level EMS, a comparative study is performed, and results show
   that the system-level EMS has advantages over other strategies in terms
   of many of the performance metrics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the use of both passive and regenerative control
   technologies, for suppression of vibrations in externally-excited
   electromechanical networks. The physical constraints on passive and
   regenerative systems result in control-theoretic constraints on the
   feedback laws they can each respectively impose. For ideal regenerative
   systems, this constraint is less restrictive than that of passive
   systems, leading to an improvement in the performance achievable.
   However, non-ideal regenerative systems exhibit parasitic losses, which
   tighten the associated constraint on control feasibility. In this paper
   we consider the optimization of passive and regenerative feedback laws,
   in the context of constrained multi-objective LQG control. In this
   context, we develop techniques to determine how low the parasitic losses
   in a regenerative system have to be, in order for its optimal feasible
   performance to exceed that of an optimal passive system. We demonstrate
   the analysis on an example pertaining to stochastic vibration
   suppression.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented that approximates the solution to a nonlinear
   optimal control problem with quadratic cost function. We assume that the
   nonlinear system is accurately represented by a high-fidelity (hf) model
   which can be of high complexity or even of ``black-box{''} type. The
   hf-model is oftentimes unsuitable for solving the optimal control
   problem. The proposed solution method is based on an Iterative Model and
   Trajectory Refinement (IMTR) strategy that uses a low-fidelity (lf)
   model to solve the optimal control problem. The lf-model is obtained
   through linearization of the hf-model, where the linearization point is
   variable by the optimization algorithm. The method is demonstrated for
   two problems of orbital transfer and of underactuated spacecraft
   attitude control with two reaction wheels. In both examples the
   solutions are shown to be in good agreement with the optimal solutions
   obtained by solving the respective nonlinear two-point-boundary value
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of wireless mobile users and applications has led to
   high demand of spectrum. Auction is a powerful tool to improve the
   utilization of spectrum resource, and many auction mechanisms have been
   proposed thus far. However, none of them has considered both the privacy
   of bidders and the revenue gain of the auctioneer together. In this
   paper, we study the design of privacy-preserving auction mechanisms. We
   first propose a differentially private auction mechanism which can
   achieve strategy-proofness and a near optimal expected revenue based on
   the concept of virtual valuation. Assuming the knowledge of the bidders'
   valuation distributions, the near optimal differentially private and
   strategy-proof auction mechanism uses the generalized
   Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction payment scheme to achieve high revenue
   with a high probability. To tackle its high computational complexity, we
   also propose an approximate differentially PrivAte, Strategy-proof, and
   polynomially tractable Spectrum (PASS) auction mechanism that can
   achieve a suboptimal revenue. PASS uses a monotone allocation algorithm
   and the critical payment scheme to achieve strategy-proofness. We also
   evaluate PASS extensively via simulation, showing that it can generate
   more revenue than existing mechanisms in the spectrum auction markets.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a novel chip integration and packaging methodology for
   millimeter-wave to terahertz band applications is demonstrated. The new
   method is based on peg and socket connection where the line and pads on
   the MMIC chip mate the lines and pads on the wafer. The socket is
   micromachined in the wafer and has the exact dimensions of the active
   chip (peg) with extended membranes to support the lines and pads on the
   wafer. The lines on the wafer are then transitioned to waveguide using a
   recently developed grounded-CPW line to waveguide transition. Metalized
   micro-cylindrical bumps are fabricated on the pads and lines to enhance
   contact. In order to validate the performance of the proposed
   integration methodology a prototype is designed and microfabricated at
   J-band and excellent measured performance is reported in the desired
   frequency range (220-260 GHz) . The new method is a strong candidate for
   a standardized integration and packaging technique at MMW to THz
   frequencies and is expected to find a wide range of applications in this
   area due to its scalability, low fabrication cost, compact form-factor
   and superb RF performance.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports on a tunable second-order bandpass filter with a
   constant bandwidth using switchable varactor-tuned resonators. A wide
   center frequency tuning range of 600 MHz to 1711 MHz is obtained using
   p-i-n diodes to switch in and out X/4 or X/2 resonators for low-band or
   high-band modes, without increasing the tuning capacitance range of the
   varactors. A combination of electric and magnetic coupling is utilized
   to realize a near constant absolute bandwidth across the tuning range.
   The filter is fabricated on a Duroid substrate with c =2.2 and h=0.787
   mm. When the p-i-n diodes are on, the center frequency is tuned form
   1070 MHz to 600 MHz while maintaining a 3-dB bandwidth of 114 +/- 10
   MHz, insertion loss of less than 3.3 dB, and return loss of better than
   15 dB. The IIP3 and P-1dB are better 18.6 dBm and 12 dBm, respectively.
   When the p-i-n diodes are off, the center frequency is tuned form 1711
   MHz to 1070 MHz (and potentially down to 1000 MHz) while maintaining a
   3-dB bandwidth of 88 +/- 8 MHz, insertion loss of less than 4 dB, and
   return loss of better than 13 dB. The IIP3 and P1dB are better 13.5 dBm
   and 10 dBm, respectively. The rejection level at 200-MHz offset
   frequency from the passband center frequency is better than 22 dB across
   the entire tuning range. To our knowledge, this planar bandpass filter
   exhibits the widest tuning range with a near-constant bandwidth.}},

   in a GaN-based 2DEG layer. Calculations suggest that acoustic
   amplification in a 2DEG is independent on the SAW frequency while only a
   very narrow bandwidth of SAWs could be amplified in bulk. Furthermore,
   the peak power gain per SAW radian occurs at a more practical carrier

Abstract = {{A 1.82mm(2) 65nm neuromorphic object recognition processor is designed
   using a sparse feature extraction inference module (IM) and a

   256-neuron IM is organized in four parallel neural networks to process
   four image patches and generate sparse neuron spikes. The on-chip
   classifier is activated by sparse neuron spikes to infer the object
   class, reducing its power by 88\% and simplifying its implementation by
   removing all multiplications. A light-weight co-processor performs
   efficient on-chip learning by taking advantage of sparse neuron activity
   to save 84\% of its workload and power. The test chip processes 10.16G
   pixel/s, dissipating 268mW. Integrated IM and classifier provides extra

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
   where the fleet contains vehicles that not only vary in performance, but
   this variation is a function of the arc type, such that a given vehicle
   might have costs lower on some arcs but higher on others. We refer to
   this as the Hybrid Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem. This is more realistic
   than the common assumption that all vehicles are identical. In many
   cases, fleets are made up of different vehicle types, varying in size,
   engine/fuel type, and other performance-impacting factors. Even in a
   homogeneous fleet, vehicles often differ by age and condition, which can
   greatly impact performance. We propose two heuristic methods that take
   into account the vehicle-specific cost structures. We provide
   computational results to demonstrate the quality of our solutions, and a
   comparison with a Genetic Algorithm based method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental study of heat
   transfer characteristics in single-phase and two-phase stagnation point
   flows pertinent to quenching of glass in the tempering process.
   Two-phase flows were generated by injecting water mist into the
   stagnation flow air far upstream of the nozzle exit. This resulted in a
   temporal and spatially invariant size distribution of the droplets that
   were carried toward the hot test plate by the air flow. PIV measurements
   were made at the nozzle exit to determine the mainitude and uniformity
   of air velocity profile in both single-phase and two-phase flows. The
   two-phase flows were also characterized by measurements of drop size
   distribution and number density using images of droplets resulting from
   laser induced fluorescence. The ratio of nozzle to-plate distance and
   the nozzle diameter was maintained at 0.5 throughout the experiments.
   Steady state experiments were performed for plate heat fluxes ranging
   from 10 to 50kW/m(2), and Reynolds numbers ranging from 2,000 to 122,000
   and water/air mass flow ratios up to 4.75\%.
   Single-phase flow results indicate that the Reynolds number dependence
   of the Nusselt number is similar to Re-0.68. Two-phase flow results show
   a maximum heat transfer enhancement of 26\% for water/air mass flow
   ratio of 4.75\%. It was visually determined that for plate temperatures
   above 200 degrees C and for the drop size distribution tested, the water
   droplets do not impinge on the plate surface. Therefore, the heat
   transfer enhancement was attributed to the evaporation of water droplets
   within the thermal boundary layer. This is an important condition to
   prevent spatially non -uniform quenching and the resulting shattering of
   glass. Transient characteristics of single-phase and two-phase flows
   were also analyzed and compared. By changing the water/air mass flow
   ratio, the cooling curve for a two-phase flow can be adjusted to meet
   the requirements of the industrial process.}},

Pages = {{351-361}},
Abstract = {{Importance sampling has been used to improve the efficiency of
   simulations where the simulation output is uniquely determined, given a
   fixed input. We extend the theory of importance sampling to estimate a
   system's reliability with stochastic simulations. Thanks to the advance
   of computing power, stochastic simulation models are employed in many
   applications to represent a complex system behavior. A stochastic
   simulation model generates stochastic outputs at the same input. Given a
   budget constraint on total simulation replications, we develop a new
   approach, which we call stochastic importance sampling, which
   efficiently uses stochastic simulations with unknown output
   distribution. Specifically, we derive the optimal importance sampling
   density and allocation procedure that minimize the variance of an
   estimator. Application to a computationally intensive aeroelastic wind
   turbine simulation demonstrates the benefits of the proposed approach.

Abstract = {{This paper considers the use of a regenerative controller to achieve
   vibration suppression in an externally-excited vibratory network,
   characterized by a model with polytopic parameter uncertainty. A
   regenerative controller must satisfy the constraint that, on average,
   more energy is extracted from the network than injected. We consider the
   multi-objective LQG optimization of such a regenerative control law,
   which exhibits performance robustness over the polytopic uncertainty
   domain. It is shown that, although the presence of uncertainty makes the
   optimal control problem nonconvex, an efficient numerical algorithm can
   be used to arrive at an optimal controller. The algorithm makes use of
   convex over-bounding Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) techniques. The
   concepts are demonstrated by an example pertaining to structural
   vibration suppression.}},

   customized their work practices so that they can serve the underserved

   the workplace over time, they adapted their patient care to align with
   the patients' prescribed health benefits. In this way, the patients were
   able to receive timely and proper medical care. We also propose

Abstract = {{The inertial collapse of cavitation bubbles is known to be capable of
   damaging its surroundings. While significant attention has been
   dedicated to investigating the pressures produced by this process, less
   is known about heating of the surrounding medium, which may be important
   when collapse occurs near objects whose mechanical properties strongly
   depend on temperature (e.g., polymers). Using a newly developed
   computational approach that prevents pressure and temperature errors
   generated by naively implemented shock- and interface -capturing
   schemes, we investigate the dynamics of shock -induced collapse of gas
   bubbles near rigid surfaces. We characterize the temperature fields
   based on the relevant non dimensional parameters entering the problem.
   In particular, we show that bubble collapse causes temperature rises in
   neighboring solid objects via two mechanisms: the shock produced at
   collapse and heat diffusion from the hot bubble close to the object.}},

   tunability of optical properties and the ability to combine with

   graphene-dielectric multilayers, whose properties can be understood with
   the effective-medium approximation (EMA). The initial experimental
   realization of this novel metamaterial has been demonstrated with a
   far-field measurement, and in this paper we investigate the light
   coupling from free space into a graphene HMM slab with a metallic
   grating using numerical simulations. We show that light can be
   efficiently coupled into the high-k guided modes in the HMM slab and be
   absorbed by the graphene layers, which can be applied to create

Abstract = {{Demand response can provide services to the power network; however,
   coordination of spatially distributed demand response resources
   generally requires coping with imperfect communication networks. This
   work investigates methods to manage communication constraints (e.g.,
   delays and bandwidth limitations), faced by demand response aggregators
   who manipulate the on/off modes of residential thermostatically
   controlled loads (TCLs). We present two model predictive control (MPC)
   algorithms that exploit a priori knowledge of delay statistics. We also
   present three Kalman filter-based state estimation methods that handle
   measurements with heterogeneous delays that are known a posteriori. We
   simulate the closed loop system to quantify the error while the system
   tracks simplified power system signals of various frequencies. We find
   that the MPC algorithm incorporating the full delay distribution, versus
   only the mean delay, reduces the average tracking error 39\%. Also,
   incorporating individual TCL models, identified on-line, within the
   state estimator versus only using a TCL aggregation model reduces the
   average estimation error 19\%.}},

Title = {{Disturbance-adaptive stochastic optimal control of energy harvesters,
   with application to ocean wave energy conversion}},
Journal = {{ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{102-115}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a technique for optimizing the power generated from
   stationary stochastic vibratory disturbances, using a resonant energy
   harvester. Although the theory is general, the target application of the
   paper concerns ocean wave energy harvesting. The control technique
   involves the use of a causal discrete-time feedback algorithm to
   dynamically optimize the power extracted from the waves. The theory
   assumes that the input impedance of the harvester is known precisely,
   but that a priori models are unavailable for the characterization of the
   stochastic behavior of the incident waves as well as the transfer
   functions characterizing their hydrodynamic excitation of the system.
   For these assumptions, we develop an adaptive control technique, which
   adapts the feedback law at each time step based on updated estimates for
   the stochastic disturbance model, obtained through a subspace-based
   system identification algorithm. The technique is demonstrated on a
   simulation example pertaining to a cylindrical surface-floating wave
   energy converter in heave. (C) 2015 International Federation of

Abstract = {{A radiative transfer model (RTM) to calculate the snow brightness
   temperatures (T-b) is a critical element in terrestrial snow parameter
   retrieval from microwave remote sensing observations. The RTM simulates
   the T-b based on a layered snow by solving a set of microwave radiative
   transfer equations. Even with the same snow physical inputs to drive the
   RTM, currently existing models such as Microwave Emission Model of
   Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS), Dense Media Radiative Transfer (DMRT-QMS),
   and Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) models produce different T-b
   responses. To backwardly invert snow physical properties from the T-b,
   differences from RTMs are first to be quantitatively explained. To this
   end, this initial investigation evaluates the sources of perturbations
   in these RTMs, and reveals the equations where the variations are made
   among the three models. Modelling experiments are conducted by providing
   the same but gradual changes in snow physical inputs such as snow grain
   size, and snow density to the 3 RTMs. Simulations are conducted with the
   frequencies consistent with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-E
   (AMSR-E) at 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz. For realistic
   simulations, the 3 RTMs are simultaneously driven by the same snow
   physics model with the meteorological forcing datasets and are validated
   against the snow in-situ samplings from the CLPX (Cold Land Processes
   Field Experiment) 2002-2003, and NoSREx (Nordic Snow Radar Experiment)

Abstract = {{The use of design ethnography for the design of human-computer
   interfaces and computer supported cooperative work systems has become
   increasingly common both in industry and as a topic of study within the
   research community. However, as of yet, few studies have been performed
   where ethnographic techniques have been applied during the design of
   other products or services. Furthermore, of these studies, even fewer
   have provided the methodological detail necessary in order to understand
   how ethnographic techniques and data influenced the design or how these
   methods may be best implemented. This study sought to address this gap
   in the literature by using and methodically documenting the use of
   design ethnography during the design of a medical device (specifically
   for low-and middle-income countries). Below we detail the methodology
   used for data collection and analysis as well as present the findings
   from the ethnographic study and how it informed the revised device
   design. A discussion on the benefits and challenges of using
   ethnographic methods in this context is presented and recommendations
   for developing and implementing design ethnography during medical device
   design are given.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treatment of a simulated domestic
   wastewater was evaluated at psychrophilic temperatures of 15, 12, 9, 6,
   and 3 degrees C. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal > 95\% was
   achieved at temperatures as low as 6 degrees C, but fell to 86\% at 3
   degrees C. As temperature decreased, soluble COD in the bioreactor
   increased suggesting a reduction in suspended biomass activity. The high
   total COD removal was maintained via biological activity in the membrane
   biofilm, which resulted in significant dissolved methane oversaturation
   in the permeate. Sequencing of 16S rRNA suggested that the biofilm's
   metabolic diversity increased as temperature decreased in response to a
   greater flux of complex organics into the biofilm due to
   temperature-based suspended biomass inhibition. Hydrogenotrophic
   methanogenesis as opposed to aceticlastic methanogenesis was the
   preferred pathway in the biofilm, but not in the suspended biomass. This
   research demonstrated that AnMBR treatment of domestic wastewater at
   very low temperatures is feasible. However, it is important to develop
   technologies for dissolved methane recovery and to consider strategies
   to improve suspended biomass activity at low temperatures to decrease
   the reliance on biofilm treatment thereby decreasing dissolved methane
   oversaturation.}},

Abstract = {{Several recent high profile outbreaks such as SARS, MERS, Ebola and
   avian influenzas draw attention to the continued risk of a deadly viral
   pandemic. In general, these enveloped viruses are not considered a major
   threat for the wastewater and water industries due to their assumed low
   concentrations in municipal wastewater and high susceptibilities to
   degradation in aqueous environments. A number of clinical reports,
   however, suggest that certain enveloped viruses are excreted in human
   feces during infection. Furthermore, survivability studies show that
   many enveloped viruses are capable of retaining infectivity for days to
   months in aqueous environments. Here, we examine the potential presence
   and fate of enveloped viruses in the urban water cycle, with emphasis on
   coronaviruses (e.g., SARS and MERS) and avian influenza viruses. We
   identify a number of pressing research questions that must be answered
   before the water and wastewater industries can confidently assure the
   public, through the dissemination of evidence-based guidance, that
   irrigation waters, recreation waters, and drinking water sources are

Abstract = {{We apply the method of the Broadband Green's Functions with Low
   wavenumber extraction (BBGFL) to calculate band diagrams in periodic
   structures. We consider 2D impenetrable objects placed in a 2D periodic
   lattice. The low wavenumber extraction is applied to the 2D periodic
   Green's function for the lattice which is used to formulate the surface
   integral equation. The low wavenumber extraction accelerates the
   convergence of the Floquet modes expansion. Using the BBGFL to the
   surface integral equation and the Method of Moments gives a linear
   eigenvalue equation that gives the broadband (multi-band) solutions
   simultaneously for a given point in the first Brillouin zone. The method
   only requires the calculation of the periodic Green's function at a
   single low wavenumber. Numerical results are illustrated for the 2D
   hexagonal lattice to show the computational efficiency and accuracy of
   the method. Because of the acceleration of convergence, an eigenvalue
   problem with dimensions 49 plane wave Floquet modes are sufficient to
   give the multi-band solutions that are in excellent agreement with
   results of the Korringa Kohn Rostoker (KKR) method. The multiband
   solutions for the band problem and the complementary band problem are

Abstract = {{Motivated by Bland's linear programming (LP) generalization of the
   renowned Edmonds-Karp efficient refinement of the Ford-Fulkerson maximum
   flow algorithm, we analyze three closely related natural augmentation
   rules for LP and integer-linear programming (ILP) augmentation
   algorithms. For all three rules and in both contexts, LP and ILP, we
   bound the number of augmentations. Extending Bland's ``discrete
   steepest-descent{''} augmentation rule (i.e., choosing directions with
   the best ratio of cost improvement per unit 1-norm length, and then
   making maximal augmentations in such directions) from LP to ILP, we (i)
   show that the number of discrete steepest-descent augmentations is
   bounded by the number of elements in the Graver basis of the problem
   matrix and (ii) give the first strongly polynomial-time algorithm for
   N-fold ILP. For LP, two of the rules can suffer from a ``zig-
   zagging{''} phenomenon, and so in those cases we apply the rules more
   subtly to achieve good bounds. Our results improve on what is known for
   such augmentation algorithms for LP (e.g., extending the style of bounds
   found by Kitahara and Mizuno for the number of steps in the simplex
   method) and are closely related to research on the diameters of
   polytopes and the search for a strongly polynomial-time simplex or
   augmentation algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The development of high-performance scintillation materials that emit
   light below 400 nm has prompted the development of improved solid-state
   UV photodetectors. While silicon provides a mature context for UV
   photodetectors, the high dark current due to its low band-gap (1.1 eV)
   limits the signal-to-noise performance when scaling the detector to
   large areas. Photodetectors fabricated in materials with a larger
   band-gap have the potential to surmount the performance limitations
   experienced by silicon. AlxGa1-xAs, is a material that provides a band
   gap from 1.55 eV to 2.13 eV, depending on the Al concentration. Using
   high Al concentration (0.7 < x < 1), AlxGa1-xAs to engineer a wider
   bandgap > 2eV is very desirable in terms of reducing dark noise. Due to
   its strong absorption of UV-light at the material surface, however,
   surface effects limit the quantum efficiency below 400 nm. Introducing
   surface layers that have a longer penetration depth for UV photons
   promises to boost the quantum efficiency in the UV while maintaining low
   dark current. This work describes the development of a photodiode
   fabricated in AlxGa1-xAs, x > 0.7, compared to an AlxGa1-xAs, x > 0.7
   photodiode with an AlAs surface (x = 1). It presents the design of the
   photodiodes, simulations of their performance, the fabrication process,
   along with characterization data of fabricated photodiodes. We report on
   the surface effects of high aluminum concentration AlxGa1-xAs, x > 0.7,
   to provide a high quantum efficiency for photons below 400 nm, by
   examining the charge collection.}},

Abstract = {{A case study concerning validation of wind speed measurements made by a
   laser wind sensor mounted on a 190 square foot floating platform in
   Muskegon Lake through comparison with measurements made by pre-existing
   cup anemometers mounted on a met tower on the shore line is presented.
   The comparison strategy is to examine the difference in measurements
   over time using the paired-t statistical method to identify intervals
   when the measurements were equivalent and to provide explanatory
   information for the intervals when the measurements were not equivalent.
   The data was partitioned into three sets: not windy (average wind speed
   measured by the cup anemometers = 6.7m/s) windy but no enhanced
   turbulence (average wind speed measured by the cup anemometers >
   6.7m/s), and windy with enhanced turbulence associated with storm
   periods. For the not windy data set, the difference in the average wind
   speeds was equal in absolute value to the precision of the gages and not
   statistically significant. Similar results were obtained for the windy
   with no enhanced turbulence data set and the average difference was not
   statistically significant (alpha=0.01). The windy with enhanced
   turbulence data set showed significant differences between the buoy
   mounted laser wind sensor and the on-shore mast mounted cup anemometers.
   The sign of the average difference depended on the direction of the
   winds. Overall, validation evidence is obtained in the absence of
   enhanced turbulence were isolated in time, studied and explained.}},

Abstract = {{Task functional MRI (fMRI) has been widely employed to assess brain
   activation and networks. Modeling the rich information from the fMRI
   time series is challenging because of the lack of ground truth and the
   intrinsic complexity. Model-driven methods such as the general linear
   model (GLM) regresses exterior task designs from voxel-wise brain
   functional activity, which is confined because of ignoring the
   complexity and diversity of concurrent brain networks. Recently,
   dictionary learning and sparse coding method has attracted increasing
   attention in the fMRI analysis field. The major advantage of this
   methodology is its effectiveness in reconstructing concurrent brain
   networks automatically and systematically. However, the data-driven
   strategy is, to some extent, arbitrary due to ignoring the prior
   knowledge of task design and neuroscience knowledge. In this paper, we
   proposed a novel supervised stochastic coordinate coding (SCC) algorithm
   for fMRI data analysis, in which certain brain networks are learned with
   supervised information such as temporal patterns of task designs and
   spatial patterns of network templates, while other networks are learned
   automatically from the data. Its application on two independent fMRI
   datasets has shown the effectiveness of our methods.}},

Abstract = {{Electric currents flowing through near-Earth space (R <= 12 R-E) can
   support a highly distorted magnetic field topology, changing particle
   drift paths and therefore having a nonlinear feedback on the currents
   themselves. A number of current systems exist in the magnetosphere, most
   commonly defined as (1) the dayside magnetopause Chapman-Ferraro
   currents, (2) the Birkeland field-aligned currents with high-latitude
   ``region 1{''} and lower-latitude ``region 2{''} currents connected to
   the partial ring current, (3) the magnetotail currents, and (4) the
   symmetric ring current. In the near-Earth nightside region, however,
   several of these current systems flow in close proximity to each other.
   Moreover, the existence of other temporal current systems, such as the
   substorm current wedge or ``banana{''} current, has been reported. It is
   very difficult to identify a local measurement as belonging to a
   specific system. Such identification is important, however, because how
   the current closes and how these loops change in space and time governs
   the magnetic topology of the magnetosphere and therefore controls the
   physical processes of geospace. Furthermore, many methods exist for
   identifying the regions of near-Earth space carrying each type of
   current. This study presents a robust collection of these definitions of
   current systems in geospace, particularly in the near-Earth nightside
   magnetosphere, as viewed from a variety of observational and
   computational analysis techniques. The influence of definitional choice
   on the resulting interpretation of physical processes governing geospace
   dynamics is presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Biosphere-atmosphere interactions play a critical role in governing
   atmospheric composition, mediating the concentrations of key species
   such as ozone and aerosol, thereby influencing air quality and climate.
   The exchange of reactive trace gases and their oxidation products (both
   gas and particle phase) is of particular importance in this process. The
   FORCAsT (FORest Canopy Atmosphere Transfer) 1-D model is developed to
   study the emission, deposition, chemistry and transport of volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs) and their oxidation products in the atmosphere
   within and above the forest canopy. We include an equilibrium
   partitioning scheme, making FORCAsT one of the few canopy models
   currently capable of simulating the formation of secondary organic
   aerosols (SOAs) from VOC oxidation in a forest environment. We evaluate
   the capability of FORCAsT to reproduce observed concentrations of key
   gas-phase species and report modeled SOA concentrations within and above
   a mixed forest at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS)
   during the Community Atmosphere-Biosphere Interactions Experiment
   (CABINEX) field campaign in the summer of 2009. We examine the impact of
   two different gas-phase chemical mechanisms on modelled concentrations
   of short-lived primary emissions, such as isoprene and monoterpenes, and
   their oxidation products. While the two chemistry schemes perform
   similarly under high-NOx conditions, they diverge at the low levels of
   NOx at UMBS. We identify peroxy radical and alkyl nitrate chemistry as
   the key causes of the differences, highlighting the importance of this
   chemistry in understanding the fate of biogenic VOCs (bVOCs) for both
   the modelling and measurement communities.}},

Abstract = {{There is increased government intervention worldwide towards supporting
   growth of the global Electric Vehicle (EV) market motivated by public
   interest in greenhouse gas emission reduction and energy security.
   Previous studies have shown a positive relationship between government
   investment and the growth of EV market share within the overall vehicle
   market. This paper describes a quantitative framework for analyzing the
   effect of EV-related government policies on emissions reduction that
   includes modeling decision making of the manufacturer, charging service
   operator and consumer.. Two interesting findings from applying this
   framework to specific urban use scenarios are reported. First, if the
   budget for the relevant government subsidies is increased, the focus
   should shift from direct support of battery EVs to building public
   infrastructure such as charging stations; second, government policies
   that affect the design of both charging services and EVs would allow the
   government more effective use of its investments.}},

Abstract = {{There is substantial evidence that many cancers, including breast
   cancer, are driven by a population of cells that display stem cell
   properties. These cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor
   initiating cells, not only drive tumor initiation and growth but also
   mediate tumor metastasis and therapeutic resistance. In this chapter, we
   summarize current advances in CSC research with a major focus on breast
   CSCs (BCSCs). We review the prevailing methods to isolate and
   characterize BCSCs and recent evidence documenting their cellular
   origins and phenotypic plasticity that enables them to transition
   between mesenchymal and epithelial-like states. We describe in vitro and
   clinical evidence that these cells mediate metastasis and treatment
   resistance in breast cancer, the development of novel strategies to
   isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that contain CSCs and the use of
   patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in preclinical breast cancer
   research. Lastly, we highlight several signaling pathways that regulate
   BCSC self-renewal and describe clinical implications of targeting these
   cells for breast cancer treatment. The development of strategies to
   effectively target BCSCs has the potential to significantly improve the
   outcomes for patients with breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Timely system identification and change detection requires real-time
   signal processing techniques. Among the many tools that help to
   understand real-world signal characteristics, time-frequency
   decomposition analysis has received a lot of attention as it does not
   place restrictions on signal stationarity and periodicity. In this
   paper, a bio-inspired framework to conduct real-time time-frequency
   decomposition of arbitrary sensor signals is proposed. The procedure can
   be detailed into four steps: 1) passing the signal through a parallel
   filter bank with distinct characteristic frequencies; 2) applying the
   Hilbert transform; 3) inhibition to the filtered signals; 4) forming
   spectrogram representation based on the inhibited Hilbert transform
   signals. This proposed technique is then applied to decompose a
   benchmark signal with known theoretical time-frequency representation
   with the performance of the method compared to existing time-frequency
   methods including the Hilbert-Huang Transform, the short-time Fourier
   Transform and the Wavelet Transform. The results show that the proposed
   method produces spectrograms comparable to the existing solutions yet
   can do so in real-time.}},

   transducers using a wide band chirp signal and measuring their time
   responses. The PCA is performed using structural response signals and
   PCA loadings are considered as input to compute the DT. Root Mean Square
   Deviation (RMSD) metrics are computed from the area formed by the
   triangles obtained from the DT. Such areas vary due to the displacement
   of loadings caused by changes in the structural condition for each PZT
   sensor. These variations have provided good evidence about the
   effectiveness of the proposed method applied to SHM systems.}},

Abstract = {{There have been many significant advancements in the development of
   sensor and sensor network technologies for structural health monitoring
   applications. As structural monitoring technologies mature and their
   instrumentation on civil infrastructures continues to grow, data

   one hand, the data management system needs to be scalable to handle
   increasing amount of data over time as well as increasing number of
   sensors instrumented. On the other hand, the system needs to be
   sufficiently flexible to support tools for data analysis for diagnostic
   and prognostic purpose. This paper describes a data management
   infrastructure for bridge monitoring using state-of-the art NoSQL
   database technologies. Specifically, the discussion focuses on the data
   flow issue and the interaction between the monitoring database system
   and data analysis modules. The sensing data collected from the Telegraph

Abstract = {{Electrically conductive nanocomposites have incredible potential for
   integrated structural damage identification when employed as matrices in
   structural fiber-reinforced composites. That is, because nanocomposites
   could consist of well-connected nanofiller networks with conductivity,
   matrix damage that severs the nanofiller network will manifest as a
   conductivity loss. Locating damage-induced conductivity losses is
   therefore tantamount to locating damage. In this regard, well-dispersed
   nanofiller networks can be thought of as pervasive and integrated sensor
   networks. This research explores this approach by utilizing electrical
   impedance tomography (EIT) to locate impact damage of a glass
   fiber/epoxy laminate plate manufactured with carbon black (CB) filler.
   It is found that EIT can successfully locate impact damage thereby
   demonstrating the potential of conductivity-based damage identification
   in structural composites with nanocomposite matrices.}},

Abstract = {{The operation and maintenance (O\&M) costs associated with wind turbines
   are comparatively high due to the size and complexity of large wind
   turbine systems. Remote and harsh field locations such as offshore wind
   farms can further rise those costs. There is a clear need to instrument
   wind turbines to monitor their behavior to identify damage and
   deterioration in an effort to lower O\&M costs. Towards this end, this
   study focuses on the deployment of a low-cost wireless monitoring system
   on a 3kW wind turbine tower to monitor the behavior of the tower under
   various operational states. Acceleration data and its spectral
   representation is used to ascertain the normal (undamaged) behavior of
   the wind turbine under varying environmental and operational conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the theoretical formulation and initial experimental
   investigation of static and dynamic strain sensing using the Composite
   Long-range Variable-direction Emitting Radar (CLoVER) transducers.
   CLoVER transducers are manufactured using the piezoelectric fibers
   integrated with the interdigitated electrodes with wedge-shaped sectors
   arranged in a circular way. A coupled-field analytical model was
   developed based on the piezoelectricity constitutive equations with the
   consideration of the anisotropic material properties of CLoVER
   transducers. The analytical formulation was derived under a cylindrical
   coordinate system for a single CLoVER sector. The final sensing
   formulation contained three strain components and six strain gradients.
   Sensing signals from nine independent CLoVER sectors with different
   installation orientations were used to compute for the nine unknown
   strain related components. Two operation conditions were discussed: (1)
   static strain sensing and (2) dynamic strain sensing. To validate our
   analytical model and demonstrate the strain sensing capability of the
   CLoVER transducers, comparative experiments with conventional strain
   gauges were conducted on a fix-free aluminum plate. The dynamic strain
   sensing performance of the CLoVER transducer and the strain gauges were
   compared. After the calibration, the measurement linearity was examined.
   The piezoelectric responses from the CLoVER sectors were compared with
   the analytical prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, service-oriented manufacturing (SUM) systems (e.g., cloud
   manufacturing (CMfg), product service systems (PSS), etc.) have
   attracted more and more interesting and attention of researchers from
   many different fields. However, because of the complex and dynamic
   environment, one of the most important issues need to be addressed for
   the promotion and application of SOM system is the dynamic supply-demand
   matching and scheduling of manufacturing resource services. In this
   paper, the issue of supple-demand matching in the typical SOM system is
   carried out at first. Then the dynamics and different models facing
   different users and different demands are analyzed respectively. As a
   result, a hypernetwork-based solution framework of this issue and the
   cloud manufacturing platform adding with the related functions are
   proposed with consideration of multi-objects, statistical
   characteristics and evolution. Finally, some future works with big data
   and industrial Internet of things are pointed out in the summary.}},

Abstract = {{Linear motor drives (LMDs) are well known to provide significant
   advantages in terms of positioning speed and precision over traditional
   screw drives (SDs), making them better suited for high-speed,
   high-precision machine tools. However, their use in such machine tools
   is limited by their tendency to consume a lot of electrical energy and
   cause thermal issues that help drive up costs. A hybrid feed drive (HFD)
   has been proposed as a possible solution to this dilemma. The HFD
   combines LMD and SD actuation to achieve speeds and accuracies similar
   to LMDs while consuming much less energy. This paper explores control
   strategies to further improve the performance of the RED without unduly
   sacrificing its efficiency. First, it highlights two performance
   limitations of the controller proposed for the HFD in prior work,
   namely, imperfect tracking and suboptimal feedback gains. Then it
   compares two approaches for achieving perfect tracking with regard to
   performance and energy efficiency. Finally, it presents an approach for
   optimizing the feedback gains of the HFD to achieve the best positioning
   performance. Simulations and experiments are used to demonstrate
   significant gains in precise positioning using the methods proposed in
   this paper, while maintaining superb energy efficiency relative to an
   equivalent LMD.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a tool wear monitoring framework for ultrasonic
   metal welding which has been used for lithium-ion battery manufacturing.
   Tool wear has a significant impact on joining quality. In addition, tool
   replacement, including horns and anvils, constitutes an important part
   of production costs. Therefore, a tool condition monitoring (TCM) system
   is highly desirable for ultrasonic metal welding. However, it is very
   challenging to develop a TCM system due to the complexity of tool
   surface geometry and a lack of thorough understanding on the wear
   mechanism. Here, we first characterize tool wear progression by
   comparing surface measurements obtained at different stages of tool
   wear, and then develop a tool condition classification algorithm to
   identify the state of wear. The developed algorithm is validated using
   tool measurement data from a battery plant.}},

Abstract = {{In nature, the formation of iron sulfide solids is mainly attributed to
   reductions of sulfate and ferric minerals by microorganisms such as
   Desulfovibrio vulgaris. In order to evaluate the impacts on microbial
   activity and optimize iron sulfide production for potential application
   in uranium remediation, we tested two types of electron donors (lactate
   and pyruvate) with three synthetic Fe(III) (hydr)oxides (goethite,
   hematite, and 2-line ferrihydrite). We monitored bacterial metabolism
   comprehensively, and characterized the biogenic solids using
   transmission electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (TEM/EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and mass distribution modeling.
   Despite similar amorphous FeS production when both e donors were
   overdosed, D. vulgaris exhibited distinct patterns of metabolism and
   other solid production with the two electron donors. Once sulfate
   reduction was complete, further lactate fermentation was inhibited by
   accumulation of H-2, and thus limited FeS production. In contrast, D.
   vulgaris utilized all pyruvate by diverting electrons from H-2 to
   formate. In addition, the pH decrease due to the proton release during
   pyruvate utilization facilitated citrate-induced Fe(III) dissolution and
   consequently enhanced Fe(III) bioavailability. However, higher pH during
   lactate utilization and excess soluble Fe(II) during pyruvate
   utilization led to precipitation of Ca-3(PO4)(2) and Fe-3(PO4)(2),
   respectively. Together, these phenomena resulted in a substantial
   enhancement of Fe(III)-(hydr)oxide reduction and iron sulfide
   productivity with pyruvate, though the concentrations of calcium and
   phosphate need to be controlled to avoid precipitation of other
   minerals.}},

Abstract = {{Building molecular-design insights for controlling both the intrachain
   and the interchain properties of conjugated polymers (CPs) is essential
   to determine their characteristics and to optimize their performance in
   applications. However, most CP designs have focused on the conjugated
   main chain to control the intrachain properties, while the design of
   side chains is usually used to render CPs soluble, even though the side
   chains critically affect the interchain packing. Here, we present a
   straightforward and effective design strategy for modifying the optical
   and electrochemical properties of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based CPs by
   controlling both the intrachain and interchain properties in a single
   system. The synthesized polymers, P1, P2 and P3, show almost identical
   optical absorption spectra in solution, manifesting essentially the same
   intrachain properties of the three CPs having restricted effective
   conjugation along the main chain. However, the absorption spectra of CP
   films are gradually tuned by controlling the interchain packing through
   the side-chain design. Based on the tailored optical properties, we
   demonstrate the encoding of latent optical information utilizing the CPs
   as security inks on a silica substrate, which reveals and conceals
   hidden information upon the reversible aggregation/deaggregation of CPs.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy and computational efficiency of four finite element thermal
   models for workpiece temperature in cylinder boring are studied. High
   temperature in precision cylinder boring of automotive engine block can
   distort the workpiece, leading to thermally-induced dimensional and
   geometrical errors. In cylinder boring, the depth of cut is small
   compared to the bore diameter, so a fine mesh is usually needed to
   analyze the workpiece temperature distribution; however fine mesh on a
   relatively large workpiece also takes extensive computational resources.
   To understand the trade-off between accuracy and computational
   efficiency, the advection, surface heat, heat carrier, and ring heat
   finite element thermal models are introduced and compared quantitatively
   in a boring process. It is found comparable global temperature
   estimation from all four models. For the temperature near the cutting
   zone, the advection and surface heat models are more accurate to predict
   local temperatures but consume more computational resources. The heat
   carrier model predicts the surface temperature with reasonable accuracy
   and computational time. The ring heat model is the most computationally
   efficient but fails to accurately estimate local peak temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{The build quality of fused deposition modeling (FDM) parts depends on
   many build parameters, such as toolpath and temperature. Destructive
   material testing methods are widely used to examine FDM parts with
   different build parameters. The optimization of build parameters relies
   on methods of experimental design and extensive material testing.
   However, this approach mainly considers the bulk properties of the FDM
   part, without fully understanding the effect of each parameter on the
   build quality. This study presents a method to investigate the integrity
   of FDM parts using nano-focus computed tomography (NanoCT). A solid
   filled ULTEM sample was built and underwent NanoCT scan. The three
   dimensional geometry of this sample was reconstructed. Structural voids
   and bubbles inside the sample were also identified and quantified. The
   volume of this solid filled sample consists of 11.9\% structural voids
   and bubbles. Air bubbles are further categorized into internal bubbles
   (bubbles inside the deposited fibers) and necking bubbles (bubbles at
   the bonding region of two adjacent fibers). While structural voids can
   be predicted according to toolpath, layer thickness, and extruder
   diameter, the occurrence of air bubbles are unexpected and can
   compromise the integrity of the built parts. NanoCT offers a
   non-destructive way to inspect the integrity of FDM parts. NanoCT can
   also be used to study three dimensional meso-structure and correlate
   that with build parameters. This will provide insightful information for
   further studying the FDM process and help to predict material strengths
   and to improve the part quality.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) is a promising machining
   technology to process non-conducing and brittle materials, featuring
   high throughput and good accuracy in meso and micro scale machining of
   hard-to-machine materials. Currently ECDM has not yet attracted wide
   interest from the industry because of the low controllability and
   repeatability. There is a huge gap in process optimization to make ECDM
   viable in industry. A good process model is essential to achieve an
   improved and optimized process. The fundamental of ECDM is the
   discharging activity, which triggers various mechanisms to remove
   material. Therefore characterization of sparks from the aspects of
   electrical and thermal properties is the premise of process modeling. In
   this paper, experimental investigation and modeling of discharging
   activity was presented. The spark releasing process was studied in terms
   of discharge energy, intensity distribution, and material removal. Conic
   tool electrodes were fabricated to achieve more consistent discharging.
   The material removal mechanism was revealed by analytical derivation and
   simulated with numerical methods.}},

Abstract = {{Vast amounts of human medical documents contain rich knowledge that can
   be used to facilitate a broad range of medical research and clinical
   study. One important application is to automatically categorize medical
   documents into specific categories. However, those medical documents
   usually contain names and identities of patients and doctors that are
   not allowed to be disclosed due to patient privacy and regulation issues
   concerning medical data. In this article, we address two issues,
   automatic name entity detection, and automatic classification of medical
   reports. We present a name entity recognition system, MD\_NER\_NCL, and
   a text document classification system, C\_IME\_RPT for medical report
   processing and categorization. The MD\_NER\_NCL contains an innovative
   segmentation algorithm, called HBE segmentation, that segments a medical
   text document into the Heading, Body and Ending parts, and a statistical
   reasoning process that utilizes knowledge of three entity lists: people
   name prefix list, people name suffix list, and false positive prefix
   list. The C\_IME\_RPT is developed based on Self Organizing Maps (SOM)
   and a machine learning process. Both systems have been evaluated using
   Independent Medical Examination (IME) reports provided by medical
   professionals. The proposed system MD\_NER\_NCL made a significant
   improvement over the well-known text analysis software, OpenNLP, for
   people name entity detection. The C\_IME\_RPT system attained a 89.9\%
   classification accuracy, which is very good in clinical record
   classification. We also present an in-depth empirical study on the
   effectiveness of parameters associated with the SOM learning process and
   text mining, and their effects on classification results.}},

Title = {{Fine-Tuning Time-of-Day Transitions for Arterial Traffic Signals}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2488}},
Pages = {{32-40}},
Abstract = {{Time-of-day operation (i.e., the implementation of different signal
   settings at different times of the day) is commonly used in traffic
   signal operation to accommodate time-dependent traffic patterns. In the
   current practice of signal retiming, traffic engineers rely largely on
   engineering judgments to determine the proper time-of-day transitions;
   this approach may lead to inefficient operations. For such a deficiency
   to be reduced, in this research an easy-to-use approach was proposed to
   fine-tune time-of-day transitions for signalized arterials. The optimal
   transition points were determined through the evaluation of total delays
   on the basis of a Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) formula. To account for
   the impact of the coordination and actuation of arterial signals, the
   researchers extended HCM formula with a simple but effective model to
   estimate the green duration of actuated traffic signals. The proposed
   approach was demonstrated and validated with a case study that used
   traffic data collected from the SMART SIGNAL system.}},

Title = {{Coarsening dynamics of binary liquids with active rotation}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{8409-8416}},
Abstract = {{Active matter comprised of many self-driven units can exhibit emergent
   collective behaviors such as pattern formation and phase separation in
   both biological (e.g., mussel beds) and synthetic (e.g., colloidal
   swimmers) systems. While these behaviors are increasingly well
   understood for ensembles of linearly self-propelled ``particles{''},
   less is known about the collective behaviors of active rotating
   particles where energy input at the particle level gives rise to
   rotational particle motion. A recent simulation study revealed that
   active rotation can induce phase separation in mixtures of
   counter-rotating particles in 2D. In contrast to that of linearly
   self-propelled particles, the phase separation of counter-rotating
   fluids is accompanied by steady convective flows that originate at the
   fluid-fluid interface. Here, we investigate the influence of these flows
   on the coarsening dynamics of actively rotating binary liquids using a
   phenomenological, hydrodynamic model that combines a Cahn-Hilliard
   equation for the fluid composition with a Navier-Stokes equation for the
   fluid velocity. The effect of active rotation is introduced though an
   additional force within the Navier-Stokes equations that arises due to
   gradients in the concentrations of clockwise and counter-clockwise
   rotating particles. Depending on the strength of active rotation and
   that of frictional interactions with the stationary surroundings, we
   observe and explain new dynamical behaviors such as ``active
   coarsening{''} via self-generated flows as well as the emergence of
   self-propelled ``vortex doublets{''}. We confirm that many of the
   qualitative behaviors identified by the continuum model can also be
   found in discrete, particle-based simulations of actively rotating
   liquids. Our results highlight further opportunities for achieving
   complex dissipative structures in active materials subject to
   distributed actuation.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the facile synthesis of grafted brush copolymers
   via the combination of metal-catalyzed chain-growth radical
   polymerization and oxidative polymerization, using a dual functional
   monomer. The most significant finding was the possibility of performing
   free-radical polymerization and oxidative polymerization in a single
   step, using copper bromide as a recyclable catalyst. Cu+ initiated the
   radical polymerization via a chain growth mechanism, and Cu2+ initiated
   the oxidative polymerization, leading to grafted brush copolymers in
   which p-conjugated polymers formed the main chains and poly(styrene
   sulfonate) (PSS) formed the high-density brushes.
   Nuclear-magnetic-resonance and Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopic
   analyses revealed the formation of poly(thiophene)-co-poly(styrene
   sulfonate) (PTh-co-PSS) and
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-co-polystyrene sulfonate
   (PEDOT-co-PSS). Ultraviolet and photoluminescence analyses confirmed the
   formation of the p-conjugated polymers during the dual polymerization
   process. These grafted brush copolymers had exceptionally good

Title = {{Band-pass processing in a GPCR signaling pathway selects for NFAT

Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{1378-1386}},
Abstract = {{Many biological processes are rhythmic and proper timing is increasingly
   appreciated as being critical for development and maintenance of
   physiological functions. To understand how temporal modulation of an
   input signal influences downstream responses, we employ microfluidic
   pulsatile stimulation of a G-protein coupled receptor, the muscarinic
   M-3 receptor, in single cells with simultaneous real-time imaging of
   both intracellular calcium and NFAT nuclear localization. Interestingly,
   we find that reduced stimulation with pulses of ligand can give more
   efficient transcription factor activation, if stimuli are timed
   appropriately. Our experiments and computational analyses show that M-3
   receptor-induced calcium oscillations form a low pass filter while
   calcium-induced NFAT translocation forms a high pass filter. The
   combination acts as a band-pass filter optimized for intermediate
   frequencies of stimulation. We demonstrate that receptor desensitization
   and NFAT translocation rates determine critical features of the
   band-pass filter and that the band-pass may be shifted for different
   receptors or NFAT dynamics. As an example, we show that the two NFAT
   isoforms (NFAT4 and NFAT1) have shifted band-pass windows for the same
   receptor. While we focus specifically on the M-3 muscarinic receptor and
   NFAT translocation, band-pass processing is expected to be a general
   theme that applies to multiple signaling pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Electrically conductive hydrogels have great potential for biomedical
   applications. However, they usually exhibited poor mechanical
   properties. We present a simple approach to prepare injectable
   conductive interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels with
   enhanced mechanical properties. The in situ forming IPN conductive
   hydrogels were based on gelatin-graft-polyaniline and
   carboxymethyl-chitosan, which were crosslinked with oxidized dextran via
   Schiff base at physiological conditions. Storage modulus of the
   injectable conductive IPN hydrogels was greatly increased. Gelation
   time, swelling ratio, pore size and conductivity of these injectable
   hydrogels were adjusted by polyaniline content. Electroactivity of the
   hydrogels was studied by UV-vis and cyclic voltammetry.
   Cytocompatibility of the hydrogels was investigated by cell adhesion and
   proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem
   cells. The in vivo biocompatibility of the hydrogels was confirmed by
   H\&E staining. These injectable conductive hydrogels with good
   mechanical properties and biocompatibility as bioactive biomaterials
   have great potential for drug delivery and tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces fully p-conjugated gradient copolymers as promising
   materials to control and stabilize the nanoscale morphology of polymer:
   fullerene solar cells. Gradient and block sequence copolymers of
   3-hexylselenophene (3HS) and 3-hexylthiophene (3HT) are utilized as the
   donors (D) in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with
   phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the acceptor (A). We show
   that for the same overall copolymer composition, the ordering of
   molecular constituents along the copolymer chain (copolymer sequence)
   significantly influences the nanoscale morphology and phase separation
   behavior of p-conjugated copolymer: fullerene devices. In addition,
   energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) of the blends
   revealed that relative to the block copolymer: PCBM, the gradient
   copolymer: PCBM sample formed a more uniform, continuous and
   interconnected network of polymer fibrils within the acceptor-rich
   phase, associated with a large D/A interface. Charge extraction of
   photogenerated carriers by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV)
   shows that the gradient copolymer: PCBM device possesses the highest
   initial carrier density, n(0) = (3.92 +/- 0.3) x 10(18) cm(-3),
   consistent with a larger D/A interfacial area suggested by the observed
   morphology, albeit at the expense of increased carrier recombination
   rate. Accelerated degradation studies show that the gradient copolymer:
   PCBM system maintains the highest efficiency over prolonged heat
   treatment.}},

   and the comparison of different sulfide passivation processes on the
   properties of InGaN/GaN quantum-disk (Qdisk)-in-nanowire based light
   emitting diodes (NW-LEDs). Our results demonstrated the first organic
   sulfide passivation process for nitride nanowires (NWs). The results
   from Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that octadecylthiol (ODT)
   effectively passivated the surface states, and altered the surface
   dynamic charge, and thereby recovered the band-edge emission. The
   effectiveness of the process with passivation duration was also studied.
   Moreover, we also compared the electro-optical performance of NW-LEDs
   emitting at green wavelength before and after ODT passivation. We have
   shown that the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) non-radiative recombination of
   NW-LEDs can be greatly reduced after passivation by ODT, which led to a
   much faster increasing trend of quantum efficiency and higher peak
   efficiency. Our results highlighted the possibility of employing this
   technique to further design and produce high performance NW-LEDs and
   NW-lasers.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel spatio-temporal filtering technique to improve the
   per-pixel prediction map, by leveraging the spatio-temporal smoothness
   of the video signal. Different from previous techniques that perform
   spatio-temporal filtering in an offline/batch mode, e.g., through
   graphical model, our filtering can be implemented online and in
   real-time, with provable lowest computational complexity. Moreover, it
   is compatible to any image analysis module that can produce per-pixel
   map of detection scores or multi-class prediction distributions. For
   each pixel, our filtering finds the optimal spatio-temporal trajectory
   in the past frames that has the maximum accumulated detection score.
   Pixels with small accumulated detection score will be treated as false
   alarm thus suppressed. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our online
   spatio-temporal filtering, we perform three video event tasks: salient
   action discovery, walking pedestrian detection, and sports event
   detection, all in an online/causal way. The experimental results on the
   three datasets demonstrate the excellent performances of our filtering
   scheme when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.}},

   single-step water-in-oil emulsification process was used to either
   directly embed mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in PEC particles created
   with various concentrations of CS and CH, or to co-embed MSC with PEC in
   agarose-based microbeads. Direct embedding of MSC in PEC resulted in
   high cell viability but irregular and large particles. Co-embedding of
   PEC particles with MSC in agarose (Ag) resulted in uniform microbeads
   80-90 mm in diameter that maintained high cell viability over three
   weeks in culture. Increased serum content resulted in more uniform PEC
   distribution within the microbead matrix, and both high and low CS : CH
   ratios resulted in more homogeneous microbeads than 1 : 1 formulations.
   Under chondrogenic conditions, expression of sulfated GAG and collagen
   type II was increased in 10: 1 CS: CH PEC-Ag microbeads compared to pure
   Ag beads, indicating a chondrogenic influence of the PEC component. Such
   PEC-Ag microbeads may have utility in the directed differentiation and
   delivery of progenitor cell populations for cartilage repair.}},

   Development for Ultrathin Whitetopping Overlay}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2481}},
Pages = {{41-47}},
Abstract = {{For a reliable repair solution to be provided for the sinkage of
   concrete pavement slabs caused by the subsidence of subgrade, low E
   modulus early strength high ductility engineered cementitious composites
   (LMES-ECC) material was developed for ultrathin whitetopping overlay
   application. Low modulus of the topping material is advantageous for
   deformation compatibility with the existing substrate concrete without
   the experience of high stress. The high tensile ductility of LMES-ECC
   further increases the deformation compatibility and suppresses the
   reflective cracking, which is a major failure mechanism of pavement
   repair. Experimental studies were conducted on LMES-ECC with respect to
   its compressive strength, tensile properties, cracking behavior under
   restrained shrinkage, and flexural properties. The compressive strength
   and flexural strength of LMES-ECC at 3 days reached 31 MPa and 7 MPa,
   respectively, which satisfied both the requirement necessary to reopen
   traffic and the design strength of concrete pavement material. Unlike
   the brittle fracture of normal concrete, multiple microcracks (i.e.,
   average crack width below 60 mu m) developed in LMES-ECC before final
   fracture under tension and bending; this deformation resulted in a
   tensile strain capacity as high as 4\% (about 400 times that of normal
   concrete) and large vertical deflection capacity. In addition, the E
   modulus of LMES-ECC was measured at 14 GPa, which was significantly
   lower than for normal concrete. The low modulus and high deformation
   capacity of LMES-ECC greatly improved the deformation compatibility of
   the topping overlay with the old concrete substrate, avoided brittle
   failure or large cracks of the overlay, and contributed to more
   effective pavement repair.}},

Title = {{Reliability-Based Topology Optimization Using Stochastic Response
   Surface Method with Sparse Grid Design}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{A mathematical framework is developed which integrates the reliability
   concept into topology optimization to solve reliability-based topology
   optimization (RBTO) problems under uncertainty. Two typical
   methodologies have been presented and implemented, including the
   performance measure approach (PMA) and the sequential optimization and
   reliability assessment (SORA). To enhance the computational efficiency
   of reliability analysis, stochastic response surface method (SRSM) is
   applied to approximate the true limit state function with respect to the
   normalized random variables, combined with the reasonable design of
   experiments generated by sparse grid design, which was proven to be an
   effective and special discretization technique. The uncertainties such
   as material property and external loads are considered on three
   numerical examples: a cantilever beam, a loaded knee structure, and a
   heat conduction problem. Monte-Carlo simulations are also performed to
   verify the accuracy of the failure probabilities computed by the
   proposed approach. Based on the results, it is demonstrated that
   application of SRSM with SGD can produce an efficient reliability
   analysis in RBTO which enables a more reliable design than that obtained
   by DTO. It is also found that, under identical accuracy, SORA is
   superior to PMA in view of computational efficiency.}},

Title = {{ENABLING REAL TIME SIMULATION OF ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING,
   CONSTRUCTION, AND FACILITY MANAGEMENT (AEC/FM) SYSTEMS: A REVIEW OF
   FORMALISM, MODEL ARCHITECTURE, AND DATA REPRESENTATION}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{1-23}},
Abstract = {{Within the past few years, simulation and modeling have been adopted by
   the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management
   (AEC/FM) industry because it provides unique opportunities to transform
   traditional human-centered decision-making in design, planning,
   execution, and maintenance practices into simulation-centered
   decision-making. This allows a decision-maker to understand system
   behavior, and predict future events without having to test scenarios and
   interfere with the current operations of an existing system. However, a
   major challenge in transitioning from human-centered decision-making to
   simulation-centered decision-making is to establish methods and
   guidelines that facilitate seamless integration of field data into
   project planning, monitoring and control, and operation. This
   integration of field data into a simulation model allows the dynamics
   and evolving nature of events that may occur in a real system to be
   integrated into the simulation for effective decision-making. The goal
   of this paper is to conduct a vigorous review and investigate the
   underlying challenges associated with aspects such as modular design,
   data interfaces and translation, and model development and validation.
   In particular, this paper: 1) presents Discrete Event Simulation
   Specification (DEVS) as a simulation formalism that facilitates
   decision-making across a single operation (e.g. earthmoving); 2) reviews
   High Level Architecture (HLA) as a distributed simulation platform that
   allows for the coupling of several standalone simulation models and data
   sources to improve decision-making across complex systems; and 3)
   describes the hierarchy of multimodal data sources for simulation and
   different formalisms (i.e. model representations) that facilitate
   storage and querying of real time data to support simulation and
   distributed simulation models. The materials presented in this paper are
   the latest findings of an ongoing collaborative project being conducted
   by the Simulation Taskforce of the Visualization, Information Modeling,
   and Simulation (VIMS) Committee of the American Society of Civil
   Engineers (ASCE), and aim to lay the foundation for future research and
   implementation efforts in AEC/FM domain-specific real-time simulation
   systems. In the long term, work in this area will enable researchers to
   address some of the most fundamental problems in AEC/FM simulation
   modeling.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{213-229}},
Abstract = {{Achieving accurate excavation profiles is a challenging task for
   excavator operators who typically use the directions of a grade-person
   to achieve design grades and levels. Allocation of an extra person is
   costly and requires constant communication between an operator and the
   grade-person, which reduces productivity. As a result, several machine
   control technology providers have developed angle sensor packages to
   monitor the pose of the excavator components in real-time. These
   systems, however, are expensive and their installation and calibration
   are costly and time consuming. This paper presents a generic and
   scalable computer-vision based framework for real-time pose estimation
   of an excavator's boom and dipper (stick) using low-cost markers
   installed on the side of the arms. The hardware components of this
   system are inexpensive and the setup process is quick and
   straightforward. The system demonstrated promising performance and has
   been shown to measure boom and dipper angles with an average uncertainty
   of less than 0.75 degrees in real-time.}},

Abstract = {{We report the development of an optofluidic laser array fabricated on a
   chip using stable plano-concave Fabry-Perot (FP) microcavities, which
   are far less susceptible to optical misalignment during device assembly
   than the commonly used plano-plano FP microcavities. The concave mirrors
   in our FP microcavities were created by first generating an array of
   microwells of a few micrometers in depth and a few tens of micrometers
   in diameter on a fused silica chip using a CO2 laser, followed by
   coating of distributed Bragg reflection (DBR) layers. The plano-concave
   FP microcavity had a Q-factor of 5.6 x 10(5) and finesse of 4 x 103,
   over 100 times higher than those for the FP microcavities in existing
   optofluidic lasers. 1 mM R6G dye in ethanol was used to test the
   plano-concave FP microcavities, showing an ultralow lasing threshold of
   only 90 nJ mm(-2), over 10 times lower than that in the corresponding
   unstable plano-plano FP microcavities formed by the same DBR coatings on
   the same chip. Simultaneous laser emission from the optofluidic laser
   array on the chip and single-mode lasing operation were also
   demonstrated. Our work will lead to the development of optofluidic
   laser-based biochemical sensors and novel on-chip photonic devices with
   extremely low lasing thresholds (nJ mm(-2)) and mode volumes (fL).}},

Title = {{An analysis of sampling programs to evaluate compliance with numerical
   standards: total phosphorus in Platte Lake, MI}},
Journal = {{LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{190-201}},
Abstract = {{Platte Lake has a numerical standard for total phosphorus mandated in
   2000 following judicial proceedings that requires volume weighted total
   phosphorus to be below 8 mg/m(3) 95\% of the time. Compliance has been
   evaluated using an extensive monitoring program that collects samples at
   roughly biweekly intervals. Analysis indicates that the lake has been
   and remains in violation of the numerical standard. This large dataset
   provides a unique opportunity to utilize statistical methods to evaluate
   compliance while controlling the Type I and Type II errors and to
   determine the minimum number of samples needed to detect changes in
   total phosphorus concentrations. Regression and analysis of variance
   were used to improve the sampling design. Similar techniques were used
   to design optimal monitoring programs for hypothetical lakes having a
   large range of total phosphorus concentrations and trophic conditions.
   Lakes with low total phosphorus concentrations require relatively few
   measurements during the year, but laboratory uncertainty necessitates
   multiple replicates. Lakes with higher total phosphorus concentrations
   require frequent sampling to obtain an acceptable estimate of the annual
   average concentration because large temporal and depth gradients are
   expected. Fewer replicates are indicated because laboratory measurements
   of higher concentrations are more reliable. A review of several
   national-scale studies indicates that few lakes have sufficient data to
   perform credible compliance evaluation or reliably detect changes in
   lake concentrations in response to shifts in watershed loads. Further,
   many laboratories have limited capability to measure the low
   concentrations of total phosphorus typically associated with
   oligotrophic lakes.}},

Title = {{Robust Topology Optimization Based on Stochastic Collocation Methods
   under Loading Uncertainties}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{A robust topology optimization (RTO) approach with consideration of
   loading uncertainties is developed in this paper. The stochastic
   collocation method combined with full tensor product grid and Smolyak
   sparse grid transforms the robust formulation into a weighted multiple
   loading deterministic problem at the collocation points. The proposed
   approach is amenable to implementation in existing commercial topology
   optimization software package and thus feasible to practical engineering
   problems. Numerical examples of two- and three-dimensional topology
   optimization problems are provided to demonstrate the proposed RTO
   approach and its applications. The optimal topologies obtained from
   deterministic and robust topology optimization designs under tensor
   product grid and sparse grid with different levels are compared with one
   another to investigate the pros and cons of optimization algorithm on
   final topologies, and an extensive Monte Carlo simulation is also
   performed to verify the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate a class of ``shape allophiles{''} that fit together like
   puzzle pieces as a method to access and stabilize desired structures by
   controlling directional entropic forces. Squares are cut into
   rectangular halves, which are shaped in an allophilic manner with the
   goal of re-assembling the squares while self-assembling the square
   lattice. We examine the assembly characteristics of this system via the
   potential of mean force and torque, and the fraction of particles that
   entropically bind. We generalize our findings and apply them to
   self-assemble triangles into a square lattice via allophilic shaping.
   Through these studies we show how shape allophiles can be useful for
   assembling and stabilizing desired phases with appropriate allophilic
   design.}},

Abstract = {{This work compares the methanol oxidation performance and stability of a
   commercial PtRu/Carbon catalyst post modified with nitrogen against an
   unmodified counterpart in alkaline media. Commercially available Hi-Spec
   JM10000 (PtRu) was modified with nitrogen via ion implantation in order
   to modify those areas not shielded by the pre-existing catalyst. The
   effects of this process on the structure and chemical composition of the
   catalyst and carbon support were explored using X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while the
   electrochemical performance and stability of the catalyst were then
   investigated using rotating disk electrode experiments. Compared to the
   unmodified catalyst, the N-modified sample had a higher initial
   electrochemical surface area, likely resulting from the ablation and
   redeposition of PtRu during the implantation process. Accelerated
   degradation test (ADT) results showed that nitrogen modification reduced
   surface area loss, helped to retain ruthenium, and improved methanol
   oxidation performance by nearly double. The benefits of nitrogen doping
   to improve state-of-the-art electrocatalysts combined with advantages of
   alkaline media improve the viability of widespread commercialization of
   direct methanol fuel cells. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All

Abstract = {{Effects of thermal inhomogeneities on syngas auto-ignition at
   high-pressure low-temperature conditions, relevant to gas turbine
   operation, are investigated using detailed one-dimensional numerical
   simulations. Parametric tests are carried out for a range of
   thermodynamic conditions (T = 890-1100 K, P = 3-20 atm) and composition
   (Phi = 0.1, 0.5). Effects of global thermal gradients and localized
   thermal hot spots are studied. In the presence of a thermal gradient,
   the propagating reaction front transitions from spontaneous ignition to
   deflagration mode as the initial mean temperature decreases. The
   critical mean temperature separating the two distinct auto-ignition
   modes is computed using a predictive criterion and found to be
   consistent with front speed and Damkohler number analyses. The hot spot
   study reveals that compression heating of end-gas mixture by the
   propagating front is more pronounced at lower mean temperatures,
   significantly advancing the ignition delay. Moreover, the compression
   heating effect is dependent on the domain size. (C) 2015 The Authors.

   various biochemical analytes paves the way for the development of a new
   generation of biosensors. Label free multianalyte immunosensing methods
   utilizing photonic probing have proven to result in better sensitivity
   and reliability than other types of biosensing methods. Here we
   described a monolithic silicon optoelectronic transducer capable of
   label-free and multianalyte determinations. The transducer includes ten
   Mach-Zehnder interferometers each of which is coupled to its own broad
   band light emitting device. The adlayers on the sensing arm cause
   spectral shifts detected at the output of the interferometers by
   coupling a portable spectrometer through an external fiber. Fourier
   transform techniques are employed to determine with a high degree of
   accuracy the shifts of the sinusoidal spectral outputs. The
   microphotonic chip was integrated with a microfluidic module and a model
   binding assay (mouse-antimouse) was run to demonstrate the operation.}},

Abstract = {{Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the most characterized pathway
   for the endocytic entry of proteins and lipids at the plasma membrane of
   eukaryotic cells. Numerous studies have probed the roles of different
   endocytic accessory proteins in regulating the dynamics of
   clathrin-coated pit (CCP) assembly. However, it is not completely clear
   how physical cues regulate CCP dynamics. Here we employ microcontact
   printing to control cell shape and examine CCP dynamics as a function of
   cell spreading area for three differently sized cells. Cells with a
   large spreading area had more short-lived CCPs but a higher CCP
   initiation rate. Interestingly, we found that fluorescence intensity of
   CCPs decreased with increasing cell spreading area in a manner that was
   dependent on the cortical actin network. Our results point to another
   facet of the regulation of CCP dynamics, suggesting that CME may be
   modulated while cells change their mechanical state and remodel their
   actin cytoskeleton during various processes.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{3661-3669}},
Abstract = {{We have designed and fabricated a miniature microscope from
   off-the-shelf components and a webcam, with built-in fluorescence
   capability for biomedical applications. The mini-microscope was able to
   detect both biochemical parameters, such as cell/tissue viability (e.g.
   live/dead assay), and biophysical properties of the microenvironment
   such as oxygen levels in microfabricated tissues based on an
   oxygen-sensitive fluorescent dye. This mini-microscope has adjustable
   magnifications from 8-60x, achieves a resolution as high as < 2 mu m,
   and possesses a long working distance of 4.5 mm (at a magnification of
   8x). The mini-microscope was able to chronologically monitor cell
   migration and analyze beating of microfluidic liver and cardiac
   bioreactors in real time, respectively. The mini-microscope system is
   cheap, and its modularity allows convenient integration with a wide
   variety of pre-existing platforms including, but not limited to, cell
   culture plates, microfluidic devices, and organs-on-a-chip systems.
   Therefore, we envision its widespread application in cell biology,
   tissue engineering, biosensing, microfluidics, and organs-on-chips,
   which can potentially replace conventional bench-top microscopy where
   long-term in situ and large-scale imaging/analysis is required.}},

   released by dissolving the template in water. We anticipate that this
   technique will be of particular importance in replicating
   physiologically soft, microstructured environments for cell culture, and
   demonstrate a first application in which intrinsically soft
   microstructures are used to measure forces generated by fibroblast-laden

Pages = {{14460-14468}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate nano-structural characteristics of carbon nanotube
   (CNT)-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite films that can be used as
   highly efficient and robust ultrasound transmitters for diagnostic and
   therapeutic applications. An inherent architecture of the nano-composite
   provides unique thermal, optical, and mechanical properties that are
   accommodated not just for efficient energy conversion but also for
   extraordinary robustness against pulsed laser ablation. First, we
   explain a thermoacoustic transfer mechanism within the nano-composite.
   CNT morphologies are examined to determine a suitable arrangement for
   heat transfer to the surrounding PDMS. Next, we introduce an approach to
   enhance optical extinction of the composite films, which uses shadowed
   deposition of a thin Au layer through an as-grown CNT network. Finally,
   the transmitter robustness is quantified in terms of laser-induced
   damage threshold. This reveals that the CNT-PDMS films can withstand an
   order-of-magnitude higher optical fluence (and extinction) than a Cr
   film used as a reference. Such robustness is crucial to increase the
   maximum-available optical energy for optoacoustic excitation and
   pressure generation. All of these structure-originated characteristics
   manifest the CNT-PDMS composite films as excellent optoacoustic
   transmitters for high-amplitude and high-frequency ultrasound
   generation.}},

   physics-based models to predict performance of materials based on their

   and parameterized for commercially pure titanium. Stored energy and
   nucleation of dislocation-free grains are added into a phase field
   grain-growth model. A two-dimensional simulation of recrystallization in
   titanium at 800 degrees C was performed; the recrystallized volume
   fraction was measured from the simulated microstructures. Fitting the
   recrystallized volume fraction to the Avrami equation gives the time
   exponent n as 1.8 and the annealing time to reach 50\% recrystallization
   (t(0.5)) as 71 s. As expected, the microstructure evolves faster when
   driven by stored energy than when driven by grain boundary energy.}},

Abstract = {{The cellular microenvironment is extremely complex, and a plethora of
   materials and methods have been employed to mimic its properties in
   vitro. In particular, scientists and engineers have taken an
   interdisciplinary approach in their creation of synthetic biointerfaces
   that replicate chemical and physical aspects of the cellular
   microenvironment. Here the focus is on the use of synthetic materials or
   a combination of synthetic and biological ligands to recapitulate the
   defined surface chemistries, microstructure, and function of the
   cellular microenvironment for a myriad of biomedical applications.
   Specifically, strategies for altering the surface of these environments
   using self-assembled monolayers, polymer coatings, and their combination
   with patterned biological ligands are explored. Furthermore, methods for
   augmenting an important physical property of the cellular
   microenvironment, topography, are highlighted, and the advantages and
   disadvantages of these approaches are discussed. Finally, the progress
   of materials for prolonged stem cell culture, a key component in the
   translation of stem cell therapeutics for clinical use, is featured.}},

Abstract = {{It has been explored for decades how to alleviate traffic congestions
   and improve traffic fluxes by optimizing routing strategies in
   intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). It, however, has still
   remained as an unresolved issue and an active research topic due to the
   complexity of real traffic systems. In this study, we propose two
   concise and efficient feedback strategies, namely mean velocity
   difference feedback strategy and congestion coefficient difference
   feedback strategy. Both newly proposed strategies are based upon the
   time-varying trend in feedback information, which can achieve higher
   route flux with better stability compared to previous strategies
   proposed in the literature. In addition to improving feedback
   strategies, we also investigate information feedback coupled with an
   evolutionary game in a 1-2-1-lane ITS with dynamic periodic boundary
   conditions to better mimic the driver behavior at the 2-to-1 lane
   junction, where the evolutionary snowdrift game is adopted. We propose
   an improved self-questioning Fermi (SQF) updating mechanism by taking
   into account the self-play payoff, which shows several advantages
   compared to the classical Fermi mechanism. Interestingly, our model
   calculations show that the SQF mechanism can prevent the system from
   being enmeshed in a globally defective trap, in good agreement with the
   analytic solutions derived from the mean-field approximation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid modeling technique for the efficient
   simulation of guided wave propagation and interaction with damage in
   composite structures. This hybrid approach uses a local finite element
   model (FEM) to compute the excitability of guided waves generated by
   piezoelectric transducers, while the global domain wave propagation,
   wave-damage interaction, and boundary reflections are modeled with the
   local interaction simulation approach (LISA).
   A small-size multi-physics FEM with non-reflective boundaries (NRB) was
   built to obtain the excitability information of guided waves generated
   by the transmitter. Frequency-domain harmonic analysis was carried out
   to obtain the solution for all the frequencies of interest. Fourier and
   inverse Fourier transform and frequency domain convolution techniques
   are used to obtain the time domain 3-D displacement field underneath the
   transmitter under an arbitrary excitation. This 3-D displacement field
   is then fed into the highly efficient time domain LISA simulation module
   to compute guided wave propagation, interaction with damage, and
   reflections at structural boundaries. The damping effect of composite
   materials was considered in the modified LISA formulation. The grids for
   complex structures were generated using commercial FEM preprocessors and
   converted to LISA connectivity format. Parallelization of the global
   LISA solution was achieved through Compute Unified Design Architecture
   (CUDA) running on Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). The multi-physics
   local FEM can reliably capture the detailed dimensions and local
   dynamics of the piezoelectric transducers. The global domain LISA can
   accurately solve the 3-D elastodynamic wave equations in a highly
   efficient manner. By combining the local FEM with global LISA, the
   efficient and accurate simulation of guided wave structural health
   monitoring procedure is achieved. Two numerical case studies are
   presented: (1) wave propagation in a unidirectional CFRP composite
   plate; (2) wave propagation in a stiffened cross-ply CFRP plate with
   delamination.}},

Title = {{Analytic Bound on Accuracy of Battery State and Parameter Estimation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{A1879-A1891}},
Abstract = {{Methods for battery state and parameter estimation have been widely
   investigated, while the achievable accuracy of the estimation remains a
   critical but somehow overlooked topic. In this paper, the analytic
   bounds on the accuracy of battery state and parameter estimation
   accounting for voltage measurement noises are derived based on the
   Fisher information matrix and Cramer-Rao bound analysis. The state and
   parameters under discussion include the state of charge, capacity and
   (ohmic) resistance. The estimation accuracy is influenced by the
   information contained in the data set used for estimation. It is found
   that the main contributing factors to the accuracy of SOC estimation are
   the slope of the OCV curve and number of data points, while the accuracy
   of capacity estimation is affected by both OCV slope and SOC variation,
   and that of resistance estimation depends heavily on the current
   magnitude. The analytic bounds are derived for both standalone
   estimation, where only one state/parameter is estimated, and combined
   estimation where they are estimated together. The loss of accuracy in
   combined estimation compared to standalone estimation is usually
   expected. However, when the current excitation satisfies certain
   patterns, such loss can be avoided. The conclusions can be used as
   guidelines for offline experiment design as well as online evaluation of
   the accuracy of adaptive state and parameter estimation. (C) The

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},

Pages = {{A1718-A1724}},
Abstract = {{Several electrode materials, such as LiFePO4, have a thermodynamic
   driving force toward phase separation. However, phase separation inside
   the electrode particles can be suppressed when the particles are
   nanosized. In this case, each individual particle remains monophasic,
   but phase separation can occur between particles via Li redistribution.
   Here, we investigate the dynamics of Li redistribution when the
   equilibrium potential is size dependent. We perform simulations of the
   charge-discharge cycle in a two-particle cell and in a 65-particle
   agglomerate. The difference in particle equilibrium potentials can lead
   to an asymmetry between lithiation and delithiation of an electrode, in
   which the order of transformation of the particles during lithiation and
   delithiation is reversed. This effect is more significant at low
   currents but almost negligible at high currents. (C) 2015 The

   Interfaces at Elevated Temperatures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{A1683-A1692}},
Abstract = {{The use of electrolyte additives is one of the most effective and
   economical ways to improve battery performance by stabilizing the
   electrode/electrolyte interface. In this work, we identified that
   fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), which is one of the important
   electrolyte additives, had different impacts on anode and cathode, by
   investigating a graphite anode and a LiMn2O4 cathode through
   electrochemical analyses at room and elevated temperatures. In the anode
   side, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer derived from FEC
   exhibited a lower interfacial resistance and excellent thermal
   stability, showing excellent rate capability and improved cycle
   retention of cells. In contrast, poor cycling retention and a rapid
   increase in the interfacial resistance of the cathode were observed at
   elevated temperature. The poorer performance of the cathode in the
   FEC-containing cell at elevated temperature was attributed to the,
   formation of a thicker surface layer and to increased Mn dissolution
   catalyzed by HF, which resulted from FEC dehydrofluorination initiated
   or accelerated by elevated temperature. Accordingly, it is suggested
   that the amount of FEC in. a full cell must be optimized to minimize the
   adverse effects of FEC on cathode. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract = {{A drug delivery system (DDS) which can achieve a sustained release of
   both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs is highly beneficial for
   biomedical applications. In this study, we present an injectable
   photocurable composite hydrogel based on methacrylated poly(ethylene
   glycol)-co-poly(xylitol sebacate) (PEGXS-M) and
   acrylamidomethyl-b-cyclodextrin (beta-CD-NMA) for both hydrophilic and
   hydrophobic drug release. The PEGXS-M copolymers were synthesized by the
   polycondensation of PEG, xylitol and sebacate, and then incorporation of
   a methacrylate group. The PEGXS-M-CD composite hydrogels were prepared
   by the photocrosslinking of a PEGXS-M and b-CD-NMA mixed solution under
   UV irradiation, and the swelling ratio, rheological properties and
   degradation behavior of the hydrogels were investigated. The
   incorporation of b-CD-NMA into the PEGXS-M hydrogel decreased the
   swelling ratio and meanwhile improved the mechanical properties.
   Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) were cultured in the
   presence of hydrogels and the cultivation results indicated good
   biocompatibility of these hydrogels. Furthermore, theophylline and
   phenethyl alcohol were chosen as hydrophilic and hydrophobic model drugs
   to be encapsulated within PEGXS-M-CD hydrogels for drug release
   investigation. The good sustained drug release efficiency of these
   hydrogels has been successfully confirmed, and the addition of
   adamantanamine hydrochloride enhanced the release of drugs from the
   hydrogels. These results suggest that the PEGXS-M-CD composite hydrogels
   have a great potential in drug delivery for the sustained release of
   both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs.}},

Title = {{A Compressive Sensing Based Analysis of Anomalies in Generalized Linear
   Models}},

Pages = {{2705-2719}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we present a compressive sensing based framework for
   generalized linear model regression that employs a two-component noise
   model and convex optimization techniques to simultaneously detect
   outliers and determine optimally sparse representations of noisy data
   from arbitrary sets of basis functions. We then extend our model to
   include model order reduction capabilities that can uncover inherent
   sparsity in regression coefficients and achieve simple, superior fits.
   Second, we use the mixed l(2)/l(1) norm to develop another model that
   can efficiently uncover block-sparsity in regression coefficients. By
   performing model order reduction over all independent variables and
   basis functions, our algorithms successfully deemphasize the effect of
   independent variables that become uncorrelated with dependent variables.
   This desirable property has various applications in real-time anomaly
   detection, such as faulty sensor detection and sensor jamming in
   wireless sensor networks. After developing our framework and inheriting
   a stable recovery theorem from compressive sensing theory, we present
   two simulation studies on sparse or block-sparse problems that
   demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms with respect to
   (1) classic outlier-invariant regression techniques like least absolute
   value and iteratively reweighted least-squares and (2) classic
   sparse-regularized regression techniques like LASSO.}},

Title = {{Retinal response to departure from perfect power coupling: implications
   for the Stiles-Crawford effect}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{1278-1282}},
Abstract = {{Maximum power transfer occurs in an oscillatory system driven by an
   external periodic force matching the natural frequency. Here, we analyze
   the role of matching in the biological phenomenon of waveguiding of
   light in a photoreceptor cone. When the fraction of light power that is
   not able to be coupled to a fundamental mode of a foveal cone is
   computed, it is found that the mismatch is proportional to the degree of
   departure from the perfect matching for one hundred percent coupling.
   Thus, Stiles-Crawford effect of the first kind is shown to be the
   response of the retina to departure from perfect matching. We show by
   correlating how the diminution in luminous efficiency recorded in
   psychophysical measurements for beams entering the pupil +/- 4 mm from
   the point of optimum efficiency in Stiles-Crawford effect of the first
   kind is due to a departure of either six or one-sixth times from this
   perfect match. The Stiles-Crawford function is recreated by interpreting
   perfect matching for axial entry of the beam and proportionate
   mismatching for corresponding degree of peripheral entries. Now the
   fundamental question is: Does a biological system respond by decreasing
   the efficiency by same amount irrespective of increase or decrease so
   long the product of departures from the value for optimum efficiency is
   unity?}},

   a 11\% higher maximum tensile load compared to joints made with friction
   stir blind riveting (FSBR). The new riveting process is compared to the

Abstract = {{The combination of fluorescent-probe technology plus modern optical
   microscopes allows investigators to monitor dynamic events in living
   cells with exquisite temporal and spatial resolution. Fluorescence
   recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), for example, has long been used to
   monitor molecular dynamics both within cells and on cellular surfaces.
   Although bound by the diffraction limit imposed on all optical
   microscopes, the combination of digital cameras and the application of
   fluorescence intensity information on large-pixel arrays have allowed
   such dynamic information to be monitored and quantified. Fluorescence
   lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), on the other hand, utilizes the
   information from an ensemble of fluorophores to probe changes in the
   local environment. Using either fluorescence-intensity or lifetime
   approaches, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy
   provides information about molecular interactions, with angstrom ngstrom
   resolution. In this review, we summarize the theoretical framework
   underlying these methods and illustrate their utility in addressing
   important problems in reproductive and developmental systems. Mol.

Title = {{Low-current field-assisted assembly of copper nanoparticles for current
   collectors}},
Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{383-401}},
Abstract = {{Current collectors are essential features of batteries and many other
   electronic devices being responsible for efficient charge transport to
   active electrode materials. Three-dimensional (3D), high surface area
   current collectors considerably improve the performance of cathodes and
   anodes in batteries, but their technological implementation is impeded
   by the complexity of their preparation, which needs to be simple, fast,
   and energy efficient. Here we demonstrate that field-stimulated assembly
   of similar to 3 nm copper nanoparticles (NPs) enables the preparation of
   porous Cu NP films. The use of NP dispersions enables 30x reduction of
   the deposition current for making functional 3D coatings. In addition to
   high surface area, lattice-to-lattice connectivity in the self-assembly
   of NPs in 3D structures enables fast charge transport. The mesoscale
   dimensions of out-of-plane features and the spacing between them in Cu
   films made by field-stimulated self-assembly of NPs provides promising
   morphology for current collection in lithium ion batteries (LIBs).
   Half-cell electrochemical models based on self-assembled films show
   improved specific capacity, total capacity, and cycling performance
   compared to traditional flat and other 3D current collectors. While
   integration of active electrode material into the 3D topography of the
   current collector needs to be improved, this study indicates that
   self-assembled NP films represent a viable manufacturing approach for 3D
   electrodes.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{19096-19103}},
Abstract = {{We synthesized a series of purely organic phosphors, bromobenzaldehyde
   derivatives, with varying conjugation length to investigate the effects
   of conjugation length on their phosphorescence emission properties. As
   the conjugation length increases phosphorescence efficiency decreases
   with a redshift in the emission color at 77 K. Our computational results
   imply that this correlation is related to the intersystem crossing rate
   and that the rate is determined by spin-orbit coupling strength rather
   than by simply the energy difference between the lowest lying singlet
   and triplet states. TD-DFT calculations show that the S-1 ->- T-1
   transition occurs more dominantly than the S-1 -> T-2 transition for all
   cases. Moreover, singlet excited states are localized on the aldehyde
   functional group, regardless of the conjugation length, while triplet
   excited states are evenly distributed over the conjugated backbone.
   Consequently, as the conjugation length increases, the larger spatial
   separation between singlet and triplet states diminishes the spin-orbit
   coupling efficiency, resulting in reduced phosphorescence.}},

Abstract = {{Research presented in this paper focuses on the experimental and
   theoretical analysis of a compact, nonlinear, broadband energy
   harvesting device. Cantilevered structure zigzag beams have been shown
   to have natural frequencies orders of magnitudes lower than traditional
   cantilever beam geometries of the same size. Literature has also
   demonstrated that a cantilever beam harvester design combined with a
   magnetic field introduces nonlinearities in the response which can
   increase bandwidth of the device. Current energy harvester designs are
   relatively large in size, are most efficient at high frequencies, or
   only useful for narrowband linear operation. The proposed research
   introduces a zigzag geometry beam used in conjunction with a magnetic
   field to create a compact device capable of low frequency broadband
   energy harvesting. Experimental results are shown comparing both the
   linear and nonlinear energy harvesting capabilities of the zigzag
   structures. Experimental results are the focus of this paper, however,
   analytical expressions for the fundamental mode shape, natural
   frequency, and electromechanical coupling are presented for the linear
   lumped parameter system. A physics based magnetic force model for the
   nonlinear system is also proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Trees exploit intriguing mechanisms such as multimodal frequency
   distributions and nonlinearities to distribute and dampen the
   aerodynamically-induced vibration energies to which they are subjected.
   In dynamical systems, these mechanisms are comparable to the internal
   resonance phenomenon. In recent years, researchers have harnessed strong
   nonlinearities, including internal resonance, to induce energetic
   dynamics that enhance performance of vibration energy harvesting
   systems. For trees, the internal resonance-like dynamics are evidently
   useful damping mechanisms in spite of the high variation associated with
   excitation and structural parameters. Yet for dynamic systems, studies
   show narrow operating regimes which exhibit internal resonance-based
   behaviors, suggesting that the energetic dynamics may be deactivated if
   stochastic inputs corrupt ideal excitation properties. To address these
   issues, this research evaluates the opportunities enabled by exploiting
   nonlinear, multimodal motions in an L-shaped energy harvester platform.
   The system dynamics are probed analytically, numerically, and
   experimentally for comprehensive insights on the versatility of internal
   resonance-based behaviors for energy harvesting. It is found that
   although activating the high amplitude nonlinear dynamics to enhance
   power generation is robust to significant additive noise in the harmonic
   excitations, parameter sensitivities may pose practical challenges in
   application. Discussion is provided on means to address such concerns
   and on future strategies that may favorably exploit nonlinearity and
   multimodal dynamics for robust energy harvesting performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental and theoretical analysis of a novel
   metamaterial-inspired distributed vibration suppression system. The
   proposed research takes advantage of uniquely designed cantilevered
   zigzag structures that can have natural frequencies orders of magnitude
   lower than a simple cantilever of the same scale. A key advantage of the
   proposed vibration suppression system is that the dynamic response of
   each zigzag structure can be made highly nonlinear with the use of
   magnets. Arrays of these compact linear and nonlinear zigzag structures
   are integrated into a host structure to form what is referred to here as
   a metastructure. The proposed and experimentally validated analytical
   model employs a Rayleigh-Ritz formulation for a linear metastructure
   represented as a cantilever beam with a distributed array of attached
   single degree of freedom oscillators. These attached oscillators are
   lumped parameter representations of the zigzag structures. Experimental
   modal analysis results are shown comparing the response of the nonlinear
   metastructure to that of both the linear metastructure and also to the
   host structure with no vibration suppression. Results show that the
   linear system can reduce the maximum response of the host structure by
   41.0\% while the nonlinear system can achieve over twice that with a
   reduction of 84.5\%. These promising preliminary results provide
   motivation for future work to be focused on developing nonlinear
   metastructures for vibration suppression.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are prime targets for morphing implementation
   as they must adapt to large changes in flight conditions associated with
   locally varying wind or large changes in mass associated with payload
   delivery. The Spanwise Morphing Trailing Edge concept locally varies the
   trailing edge camber of a wing or control surface, functioning as a
   modular replacement for conventional ailerons without altering the spar
   box. Utilizing alternating active sections of Macro Fiber Composites
   (MFCs) driving internal compliant mechanisms and inactive sections of
   elastomeric honeycombs, the SMTE concept eliminates geometric
   discontinuities associated with shape change, increasing aerodynamic
   performance. Previous work investigated a representative section of the
   SMTE concept and investigated the effect of various skin designs on
   actuation authority. The current work experimentally evaluates the
   aerodynamic gains for the SMTE concept for a representative finite wing
   as compared with a conventional, articulated wing. The comparative
   performance for both wings is evaluated by measuring the drag penalty
   associated with achieving a design lift coefficient from an off-design
   angle of attack. To reduce experimental complexity, optimal control
   configurations are predicted with lifting line theory and experimentally
   measured control derivatives. Evaluated over a range of off-design
   flight conditions, this metric captures the comparative capability of
   both concepts to adapt or ``morph{''} to changes in flight conditions.
   Even with this simplistic model, the SMTE concept is shown to reduce the
   drag penalty due to adaptation up to 20\% at off-design conditions,
   justifying the increase in mass and complexity and motivating concepts
   capable of larger displacement ranges, higher fidelity modelling, and
   condition-sensing control.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) are localized vibrational responses
   that may occur in a variety of nonlinear periodic systems. Many
   investigations have characterized the existence and stability of ILMs
   and they have been realized in systems representing numerous domains and
   length scales. Previous studies indicate that ILMs strongly interact
   with an impurity via attraction or repulsion from the damage location.
   In this research to exploit such phenomena for structural damage
   identification, we analyze the interaction of an ILM with multiple
   impurities, where a steered impurity strategically guides the ILM
   towards another, static impurity representative of damage. We discover
   and catalog the distinct phenomenological interaction types between
   steered ILMs and damage. For some interaction types, the ILM propagation
   rate temporarily exceeds a threshold, a behavior that is shown to
   consistently coincide with ILM interaction with damage (the static
   impurity). The quantitatively distinct interaction types are used to
   devise a method to effectively identify damage in the nonlinear periodic
   structure. Numerous studies are performed to assess the viability and
   accuracy of the proposed damage identification method and to examine its
   robustness to random structural heterogeneity. Beyond stiffness change,
   the proposed method is applicable to monitoring other system
   characteristics, such as changing mass or multifield features, which may
   be representative of damage or static impurity.}},

Title = {{Big Data Analytics in Healthcare}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The rapidly expanding field of big data analytics has started to play a
   pivotal role in the evolution of healthcare practices and research. It
   has provided tools to accumulate, manage, analyze, and assimilate large
   volumes of disparate, structured, and unstructured data produced by
   current healthcare systems. Big data analytics has been recently applied
   towards aiding the process of care delivery and disease exploration.
   However, the adoption rate and research development in this space is
   still hindered by some fundamental problems inherent within the big data
   paradigm. In this paper, we discuss some of these major challenges with
   a focus on three upcoming and promising areas of medical research:
   image, signal, and genomics based analytics. Recent research which
   targets utilization of large volumes of medical data while combining
   multimodal data from disparate sources is discussed. Potential areas of
   research within this field which have the ability to provide meaningful
   impact on healthcare delivery are also examined.}},

Title = {{A low cost, low energy route to solar grade silicon from rice hull ash
   (RHA), a sustainable source}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{3931-3940}},
Abstract = {{Polycrystalline silicon, with impurity levels lower than those of the
   SEMI III standard for solar grade silicon feedstock (approximate to
   99.9999\% pure), was produced using rice hull ash (RHA) as a biogenic
   silica source. The RHA is first purified using very simple, low cost,
   low energy, acid milling/boiling water wash purification steps and
   pelletization followed by carbothermal reduction using an experimental
   50 kW electric arc furnace (EAF) operated at 1700-2100 degrees C in
   batch mode. Typical processing involves adding 3.6 kg of pellets to the
   EAF followed by introduction of an additional 3.6 kg charge every 6 h
   after the start of carbothermal reduction. This approach produces up to
   1.6 kg of silicon per batch. Purities, determined by inductively coupled
   plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), were reproducibly found
   to be 99.9999 wt\% (6 Ns) with B contents of approximate to 0.1 part per
   million by weight. This process escapes multiple process steps including
   the intermediacy of metallurgical grade silicon and the production and
   reduction of chlorosilanes as currently used in the Siemen's process.
   Furthermore, burning rice hulls to produce electricity and RHA,
   generates more energy than required for the overall process. Finally,
   the carbon footprint for the process discussed here is very low. The
   rice plant ``fixes{''} CO2 as it grows. The recovered hull contains
   sufficient amounts of this carbon that it can be burned to generate
   electricity returning part of this carbon to the atmosphere as CO2. The
   carbon retained in the RHA is still from fixed CO2 and provides the
   carbon source (especially in the Path 2 process) for carbothermal
   reduction returning the remaining carbon to the atmosphere as CO2. A
   further point is that the alternative of landfilling with RHA or
   especially rice hulls would lead to generation of methane, a known green
   house gas. Thus, one might even argue that the carbon footprint for the
   process described here is actually negative.}},

Title = {{Phytochemicals potently inhibit migration of metastatic breast cancer
   cells}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{792-800}},
Abstract = {{Cell migration is a major process that drives metastatic progression of
   cancers, the major cause of cancer death. Existing chemotherapeutic
   drugs have limited efficacy to prevent and/or treat metastasis,
   emphasizing the need for new treatments. We focus on triple negative
   breast cancer (TNBC), the subtype of breast cancer with worst prognosis
   and no standard chemotherapy protocols. Here we demonstrate that a group
   of natural compounds, known as phytochemicals, effectively block
   migration of metastatic TNBC cells. Using a novel cell micropatterning
   technology, we generate consistent migration niches in standard 96-well
   plates where each well contains a cell-excluded gap within a uniform
   monolayer of cells. Over time, cells migrate into and occupy the gap.
   Treating TNBC cells with non-toxic concentrations of phytochemicals
   significantly blocks motility of cells. Using a molecular analysis
   approach, we show that anti-migratory property of phytochemicals is
   partly due to their inhibitory effects on phosphorylation of ERK1/2.
   This study provides a framework for future studies to understand
   molecular targets of phytochemicals and evaluate their effectiveness in
   inhibiting metastasis in animal models of cancer.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{819-843}},
Abstract = {{We study a basic resource allocation problem that arises in cloud
   computing environments. The physical network of the cloud is represented
   as a graph with vertices representing servers and edges corresponding to
   communication links. A workload is a set of processes with processing
   requirements and mutual communication requirements. The workloads arrive
   and depart over time, and the resource allocator must map each workload
   upon arrival to the physical network. We consider the objective of
   minimizing the congestion. We show that solving a subproblem (SingleMap)
   about mapping a single workload to the physical graph essentially
   suffices for solving the general problem. In particular, an
   alpha-approximation algorithm for SingleMap gives an O(alpha log nD)
   competitive algorithm for the general problem, where n is the number of
   nodes in the physical network and D is the maximum to minimum workload
   duration ratio. We then consider the SingleMap problem for two natural
   classes of workloads, namely depth-d trees and complete-graph workloads.
   For depth-d trees, we give an n(O(d)) time O(d(2) log(nd))-approximation
   algorithm based on a strong LP relaxation inspired by the Sherali-Adams
   hierarchy. For complete graphs, we give a polylogarithmic approximation
   algorithm using Racke decompositions.}},

Pages = {{916-943}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating multiple graphical
   models simultaneously using the fused lasso penalty, which encourages
   adjacent graphs to share similar structures. A motivating example is the
   analysis of brain networks of Alzheimer's disease using neuroimaging
   data. Specifically, we may wish to estimate a brain network for the
   normal controls (NC), a brain network for the patients with mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI), and a brain network for Alzheimer's patients
   (AD). We expect the two brain networks for NC and MCI to share common
   structures but not to be identical to each other; similarly for the two
   brain networks for MCI and AD. The proposed formulation can be solved
   using a second-order method. Our key technical contribution is to
   establish the necessary and sufficient condition for the graphs to be
   decomposable. Based on this key property, a simple screening rule is
   presented, which decomposes the large graphs into small subgraphs and
   allows an efficient estimation of multiple independent (small)
   subgraphs, dramatically reducing the computational cost. We perform
   experiments on both synthetic and real data; our results demonstrate the
   effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.}},

   drilled nanopore. We found that both the diameter of the nanopore and
   the membrane material itself have significant influences on the
   electroosmotic flow through the nanopore and thus on the threading
   force. Compared to a bare silicon-nitride membrane, the threading of DNA
   through only 3 nm thin carbon nano membranes as well as lipid
   bilayer-coated nanopores increased the threading force by 15\% or 85\%,
   respectively. This finding was quantitatively described by our recently
   developed theoretical model that also incorporates hydrodynamic slip
   effects on the translocating DNA molecule and the force dependence on
   the membrane thickness. The additional measurements presented in this
   paper further support our model.}},

Title = {{Flow-through microfluidic photoionization detectors for rapid and highly
   sensitive vapor detection}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{3021-3029}},
Abstract = {{A photoionization detector (PID) is well known for its high sensitivity,
   large dynamic range, and non-destructive vapor detection capability.
   However, due to its tardy response, which results from the relatively
   large ionization chamber and dead volume, the application of the PID in
   gas chromatography (GC) has been limited. Here, we developed a rapid,
   flow-through, and highly sensitive microfluidic PID that was
   microfabricated directly on a conductive silicon wafer. The microfluidic
   PID has a significantly reduced ionization chamber volume of only 1.3 mu
   L, nearly 10 times smaller than that of state-of-the-art PIDs and over
   100 times smaller than that of commercial PIDs. Moreover, it has
   virtually zero dead volume due to its flow-through design. Consequently,
   the response time of the microfluidic PID can be considerably shortened,
   ultimately limited by its residence time (7.8 ms for 10 mL min(-1) and
   78 ms for 1 mL min(-1)). Experimentally, the response of the
   microfluidic PID was measured to be the same as that of the standard
   flame ionization detector with peak full-widths-at-half-maximum of 0.25
   s and 0.085 s for flow rates of 2.3 mL min(-1) and 10 mL min(-1),
   respectively. Our studies further show that the microfluidic PID was
   able to detect analytes down to the picogram level (at 3 sigma of noise)
   and had a linear dynamic range of six orders of magnitude. Finally,
   because of the very short distance between the electrodes, low voltage
   (<10 VDC, over 10 times lower than that in a regular PID) can be used
   for microfluidic PID operation. This work will open a door to broad
   applications of PIDs in gas analyzers, in particular, micro-GC and
   multi-dimensional GC.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable design of engineered products and systems is fantastically
   challenging. Think up a technology that protects the environment and
   perhaps a business model cannot be developed for it. Think up a business
   model for the technology that resonates with the market and consumers
   use so much of the technology that Earth would have been better without
   it. In the meantime the landscape is constantly shifting due to
   transient regulations, technology potential, and knowledge about
   anthropogenic impacts on Earth. This presentation focuses on the
   effectiveness of sustainable design and emphasizes the need to
   simultaneously evaluate market success, environmental impact, and
   meeting societal needs under regulatory constraints. The paper provides
   framework approaches to concept generation and design validation that
   facilitate the evaluation of design sustainability. The presentation
   that will accompany this paper will discuss research case studies from
   the University of Michigan and evaluate them against these frameworks as
   illustrative examples. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{For disassembly sequence generation, partial disassembly and sequence
   dependent task times are typically not considered together in the same

   determines the optimal partial disassembly sequence according to reuse
   value only, followed by the second stage that finds the optimal partial
   disassembly sequence that also includes sequence dependence task times.
   We prove the optimality of the two-stage approach under the condition
   that all components with any positive reuse value must be included in
   the final sequence. If this condition does not need to be met, a task
   hedging policy is shown to be effective. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

   Equation for High-Contrast Scatterers}},
Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Pages = {{1423-1426}},
Abstract = {{Volume integral equations (VIEs) are commonly used to analyze scattering
   from inhomogeneous dielectric objects. Unfortunately, when VIEs are
   applied to high-contrast scatterers, their discretization results in
   ill-conditioned systems of equations. Oftentimes volume-surface integral
   equations (VSIEs) are used to eliminate this effect. However, when the
   scatterer's mesh has elements that are much smaller than the wavelength,
   VSIEs become ill-conditioned, too. This letter introduces a new set of
   internally combined VSIEs (ICVSIEs) that exhibit neither of these
   ill-conditioning phenomena. Just like in previous VSIE methods, surface
   currents are used to artificially increase the effective permittivity of
   the background medium in which volume polarization currents radiate. To
   remove ill-conditioning due to electrical size, coupling between the
   surface and volume is accounted for by judiciously adding contributions
   due to ``exterior{''} and ``interior{''} surface currents. Numerical
   data obtained by analyzing time-harmonic TE scattering from various 2-D
   layered cylinders suggests that discretization of the new ICVSIE yields
   matrices that are unaffected by the scatterer's maximum permittivity and
   electrical size.}},

   markers using shape-coded hydrogel microparticles}},
Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{4530-4539}},
Abstract = {{Elevated serum concentrations of angiogenic markers including vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and
   platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) have been correlated with various
   clinical disorders including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes
   mellitus, and liver fibrosis. In addition, the correlation between the
   serum concentrations of these factors, clinical diagnosis, prognosis,
   and response to therapeutic agents is significant. Thereby suggesting
   high-throughput detection of serum levels of angiogenic markers has
   important implications in early detection of different clinical
   disorders as well as for subsequent therapy monitoring. Here, we
   demonstrate the feasibility of utilization of shape-coded hydrogel
   microparticle based suspension arrays for quantitative and reproducible
   measurement of VEGF, FGF, and PDGF in single and multiplexed assays.
   Bio-inert PEG hydrogel attenuated the background signal thereby
   improving the sensitivity of the detection method as well as eliminating
   the need for blocking the proteins. In the singleplexed assay, the
   detection limits of 1.7 pg ml-1, 1.4 pg ml(-1), and 1.5 pg ml(-1) for
   VEGF, FGF, and PDGF respectively indicated that the sensitivity of the
   developed method exceeds that of the conventional technologies. We also
   demonstrated that in the multiplexed assays, recovery of the proteins
   was within 20\% of the expected values. The practical applicability of
   the hydrogel microparticle based detection system was established by
   demonstrating the ability of the system to quantify the production of
   VEGF, FGF, and PDGF by breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231).}},

Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{494-506}},
Abstract = {{Definitions of soil particle sphericity, roundness and roughness have
   existed since at least the 1930s. In the 1950s, charts of typical
   sphericity and roundness values were developed to alleviate tedious
   manual determination. They allowed users to classify particles by visual
   comparison to typical particles possessing ranges of sphericity and
   roundness. The original definitions and somewhat subjective chart
   methods are still widely used today. This paper describes robust
   numerical methods based on computational geometry to determine precisely
   the traditional values from two-dimensional images of particles.
   Statistical methods including locally weighted regression and K-fold
   cross-validation were used to discretise a mean particle surface and
   thereby quantify and remove roughness. The paper details the algorithms
   for identifying particle corners and fitting circles to them for
   computation of roundness. Conclusions are also drawn regarding the most
   appropriate definition for particle sphericity from among five that are
   commonly cited. Finally, recommendations are made for the minimum image
   resolutions and particle perimeter discretisation necessary to obtain
   accurate results.}},

Abstract = {{Among the many emerging strategies for macromolecular self-assembly,
   only a few of them with strong and highly selective molecular
   recognition are able to achieve ordered self-organization in molecular
   level. DNA is unquestionably an ideal model in nature carrying such
   molecular recognition and has been used to design a variety of exquisite
   self-assemblies at nanoscales. In this review, we focus on the recent
   advances in DNA nanotechnology from the point of view of chemistry. Two
   major mechanisms for DNA self-assembly, tile-based DNA self-assembly and
   DNA origami, are introduced with some very intriguing examples and
   promising applications. On the other hand, DNA-inspired synthetic
   polymer is another appealing field for well-defined nanostructure
   fabrication. Therefore, the DNA-like behaviors of synthetic polymers are
   also reviewed, including the self-assembly of side-chain
   multiple-hydrogen-bonding polymers and DNA (or its mimics) mediated
   polymerizations. The synthetic methods, self-organization mechanisms and
   potential applications of selected cases are illustrated. In the end, we
   highlight the challenges and drawbacks of the current methods for
   DNA-and DNA-mimic-based supramolecular assembly with possible solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Several compositions of the n-type, TixZr1-xNiSn0.975Ge0.025 (x = 0,
   0.1, 0.15 and 0.25), half-Heusler (HH) alloys were synthesized by
   reacting elemental powders at high temperature using induction melting.
   The resulting ingots were annealed at 900 degrees C for 2 weeks and
   mechanically alloyed to achieve fine grain size. X-ray powder
   diffraction suggested the formation of products with HH structure.
   However, electron microscopy studies revealed phase separation into
   Ti-rich and Zr-rich domains for the ingot with x = 0.25. The effect of
   band gap engineering through isoelectronic substitution of Sn by Ge and
   mass fluctuation arising from the intermixing of Ti and Zr in the HH
   structure on the electronic and thermal transport in the temperature
   range from 300 K to 775 K was investigated. A large reduction in the
   lattice thermal conductivity (4.9 W K-1 m(-1) to 2.7 W K-1 m(-1) at 300
   K) was observed with increasing Ti concentration. Surprisingly, the
   thermopower and electrical conductivity for the sample with x = 0.25
   simultaneously increase with rising temperature from -120 mu V K-1 and
   510 S cm(-1) at 300 K to -160 mu V K-1 and 840 S cm(-1) at 775 K. The
   combination of large reduction in lattice thermal conductivity via mass
   fluctuation at the Ti/Zr site with optimization of the thermopower and
   electrical conductivity through Ge substitution at the Sn site
   significantly improved the figure of merit from 0.05 to 0.48 at 775 K
   for the sample with x = 0.25.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in wireless sensor technology have enabled low cost and
   extremely scalable sensing platforms prompting high density sensor
   installations. High density long-term monitoring generates a wealth of
   sensor data demanding an efficient means of data storage and data
   processing for information extraction that is pertinent to the decision
   making of bridge owners. This paper reports on decision making
   inferences drawn from automated data processing of long-term highway
   bridge data. The Telegraph Road Bridge (TRB) demonstration testbed for
   sensor technology innovation and data processing tool development has
   been instrumented with a long-term wireless structural monitoring system
   that has been in operation since September 2011. The monitoring system
   has been designed to specifically address stated concerns by the
   Michigan Department of Transportation regarding pin and hanger steel
   girder bridges. The sensing strategy consists of strain, acceleration
   and temperature sensors deployed in a manner to track specific damage
   modalities common to multi-girder steel concrete composite bridges using
   link plate assemblies. To efficiently store and process long-term sensor
   data, the TRB monitoring system operates around the SenStore database
   system. SenStore combines sensor data with bridge information (e.g.,
   material properties, geometry, boundary conditions) and exposes an
   application programming interface to enable automated data extraction by
   processing tools. Large long-term data sets are modeled for
   environmental and operational influence by regression methods. Response
   processes are defined by statistical parameters extracted from long-term
   data and used to automate decision support in an outlier detection, or
   statistical process control, framework.}},

Abstract = {{The bronze polymorph of titanium dioxide, TiO2-B, characterized by a
   crystal structure with a relatively open layered geometry, is a material
   of interest for various energy applications, including photovoltaics,

   CaTi5O11, which serves as an effective template layer, when deposited on
   (100) SrTiO3, for the growth of high quality single crystalline films of
   TiO2-B, is also of interest for such applications. For both materials, a
   detailed understanding of the film growth and defect structure is deemed
   critical to the successful realization of these applications in thin
   film devices. Thus, using results obtained with aberration-corrected
   transmission electron microscopy, we present an analysis of the defects

Abstract = {{The detection of damage in structures at its earliest stages has many
   economical and safety benefits. Permanent monitoring systems using
   various forms of sensor networks and analysis methods are often employed
   to increase the frequency and diagnostic capabilities of inspections.
   Some of these techniques provide spatial/volumetric information about a
   given area/volume of a structure. Many of the available spatial sensing
   techniques can be costly and cannot be permanently deployed (e.g., IR
   camera thermography). For this reason intricate analysis methods using
   permanently deployable sensors are being developed (e.g., ultrasonic
   piezoelectrics, sensing skins). One approach is to leverage the low cost
   of heaters and temperature sensors to develop an economical, permanently
   installable method of spatial damage detection using heat transfer. This
   paper presents a method similar to that of X-ray computed tomography
   (CT). However, the theories for Xray CT must be adapted to properly
   represent heat transfer as well as account for the relatively large and
   immobile sensors spacing used on a structure (i.e., there is a finite
   number of heaters/sensors permanently installed around the perimeter of
   the area of interest). The derivation of heat transfer computed
   tomography is discussed in this paper including two methods for steering
   the effective heat wave. A high fidelity finite element method (FEM)
   model is used to verify the analytical derivation of individual steps
   within the method as well as simulate the complete damage detection
   technique. Experimental results from both damaged and undamaged aluminum
   plate specimens are used to validate the FEM model and to justify
   theoretical assumptions. The simulation results are discussed along with
   possible improvements and modifications to the technique.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental verification of a method of
   evaluating local damage in steel beam-column connections using modal
   vibratory characteristics under ambient vibrations. First, a unique
   testing method is proposed to provide a vibration-test environment which
   enables measurements of modal vibration characteristics of steel
   beam-column connection as damage proceeds. In the testing method, a
   specimen of structural component is installed in a resonance frame that
   supports large fictitious mass and the resonance frequency of the entire
   system is set as the natural frequency of a mid-rise steel building. The
   specimen is damaged quasi-statically, and resonance vibration tests are
   conducted with a modal shaker. The proposed method enables evaluation of
   realistic damage in structural components without constructing a large
   specimen of an entire structural system. The transition of the neutral
   axis and the reduction of the root mean square (RMS) of dynamic strain
   response are tracked in order to quantify damage in floor slabs and
   steel beams, respectively. Two specimens of steel beam-column connection
   with or without floor slab were tested to investigate sensitivity of the
   damage-related features to loss of floor composite action and fractures
   in steel beams. In the end, by updating numerical models of the
   specimens using the identified damage-related features, seismic
   capacities of damaged specimens were estimated.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the use of impediographic tomography to achieve high
   sensitivity and high resolution damage identification in plate-like
   structures. The impediographic approach exploits the coupled
   piezo-resistive and electrostatic response of the host structure to
   generate high sensitivity and high resolution maps of its internal
   electrical conductivity. Focused acoustic waves are used to generate
   localized electrical conductivity perturbations that allow a drastic
   improvement in the conditioning of the inverse problem. The localized
   acoustic perturbations are obtained by exploiting the concept of
   Frequency Selective Structures (FSS) in which intentional mistuning of
   periodically distributed structural features, such as thin notches,
   enables self-focusing and vibration localization by using a single
   ultrasonic transducer. The impediographic reconstruction is achieved by
   using two different methods: the 0-Laplacian and the
   Levenberg-Marquardt. Both methodologies are compared in terms of
   accuracy of the reconstructed electrical conductivity and of their
   ability to deal with important practical issues such as limited view and
   limited perturbation data. Numerical results show that, although both
   approaches perform well in terms of damage identification, localization,
   and sizing, the LM technique allows higher flexibility in handling
   imperfect data.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Recently, ultrasound signals termed `lung water comets'
   associated with pulmonary edema have been correlated with adverse
   clinical events in dialysis patients. These comets fluctuate
   substantially during the ultrasound exam highlighting the need for
   objective quantitative measurement methods. Methods: We developed an
   image-processing algorithm for the detection and quantification of lung
   comets. Quantification measures included comet number (comet count) and
   the fraction of the ultrasound beams with comet findings (comet
   fraction). We used this algorithm in a pilot study in 20 stable dialysis
   outpatients to identify associations between ultrasound comets and
   clinical parameters including blood pressure (BP), percent blood volume
   reduction on dialysis (\%BV), ejection fraction (EF), and
   ultrafiltration on dialysis (UF). Results: Positive findings included
   associations with lung comet measurements with pre-dialysis Diastolic BP
   (r = 0.534, p = 0.015), subject age (r = -0.446, p = 0.049), and a
   combination of EF and end dialysis \%BV reduction (r = -0.585, p =
   0.028). Comet fraction and comet count were closely correlated due to
   the inherent relationship between these two metrics (r = 0.973, p <
   0.001). Negative findings included ultrasound comets that did not change
   from beginning to end of dialysis (p = 0.756), and were not
   significantly correlated with single dialysis treatment UF (p = 0.522),
   subject body weight (p = 0.208), or BMI (p = 0.358). Conclusions:
   Ultrasound signal processing methods may help quantify lung ultrasound
   comets. Additional findings include algorithmic lung comet measurement
   that did not change significantly during single dialysis sessions in
   these stable outpatients, but were associated with cardiovascular and
   fluid status parameters. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{The use of template nanostructures for the creation of photovoltaic and
   thermoelectric semiconductors is becoming a quickly expanding synthesis
   strategy. In this work we report a simple two-step process enabling the
   formation of ternary CuAgSe nanoplatelets with a great degree of control
   over the composition and shape. Starting with hexagonal nanoplatelets of
   cubic Cu2-xSe, ternary CuAgSe nanoplatelets were generated through a
   rapid ion exchange reaction at 300 K using AgNO3 solution. The Cu2-xSe
   nanoplatelet template and the final CuAgSe nanoplatelets were analyzed
   by electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was found that
   both the low temperature pseudotetragonal and the high temperature cubic
   forms of CuAgSe phase were created while maintaining the morphology of
   the Cu2-xSe nanoplatelet template. Thermal and electronic transport
   measurements of hot-pressed pellets of the synthesized CuAgSe
   nanoplatelets showed a drastic reduction in the thermal conductivity and
   a sharp transition from n-type (S = -45 mu V K-1) to p-type (S = +200 mu
   V K-1) semiconducting behavior upon heating above the structural
   transition from the low temperature orthorhombic to the high temperature
   super-ionic cubic phase. This simple reaction process utilizing a
   template nanostructure matrix represents an energy efficient,
   cost-efficient, and versatile strategy to create interesting materials
   with lower defect density and superior thermoelectric performance.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Results of a detailed study, based on the parametric analysis of
   activated corrosion products, in primary coolant of a typical
   pressurized water reactor (PWR) are presented. The parameters
   influencing time dependent buildup of corrosion product activity (CPA)
   in primary coolant loop of PWR were identified. The computer program
   CPAIR was used to accommodate for time dependent corrosion rates. The
   behaviors of Mn-56, Co-58, and Co-60 were studied over the reactor
   operational time. During the course of normal operation of reactor, the
   CPA is dominated by Mn-56, while Co-58 and Co-60 are the predominant
   radionuclides after reactor shutdown. Parametric study suggests that the
   total CPA is most sensitive to ion-exchanger removal rates. For a
   removal rate of 300 cm(3) -s(-1), the specific activity due to Mn-56 has
   the maximum value of 3.552 x 10(4) Bq-m(-3) after 1,000 hours of reactor
   operation. This value decreases drastically to 8.325 x 10(3) Bq-m(-3) at
   removal rate of 900 cm(3) -s(-1). Additionally, CPA due to Mn-56, Co-58,
   and Co-60 shows strong dependence on removal rates from the core
   material surfaces. Variations in the values of radionuclide removal
   rates from piping surface and radionuclide removal rate from deposition
   on pipes showed only very small effects on CPA buildup.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread application of supercapacitors, which store electrical
   charge on high-surface-area conducting materials, is limited by their
   small accessible area and low areal mass loading of active materials due

   cauliflower-fungus-like graphene (CFG) with hierarchical
   meso-porous-structure and large fully accessible surface area, which was
   synthesized directly from CO2 via the one-step exothermic approach,
   exhibited an ultrahigh areal capacitance up to 1.16 F cm (2) at a high
   current density up to 10 A g(-1). The excellent performance remained
   almost unchangedwith increasing temperature to 55 degrees C.
   Furthermore, the 3D CFG electrode can reach a high
   efficient-mass-loading of 11.16 mg cm(-2), which meets the current
   commercial requirement (about 10 mg cm(-2)). This solves a critical

Abstract = {{The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a novel photoacoustic (QPA)
   platform for highly-sensitive and quantitative assessment of bone
   health. First, the feasibility to perform 3D photoacoustic imaging (PAI)
   of bone was investigated. Then another two techniques, including thermal
   photoacoustic measurement (TPAM) and photoacoustic spectral analysis
   (PASA), both being able to achieve quantitative results were
   investigated for bone characterization. TPAM, by evaluating the
   dependence of photoacoustic signal amplitude on the sample temperature,
   is sensitive to the chemical constituents in tissue and holds promise
   for assessment of bone mineral density (BMD). PASA characterizes micron
   size physical features in tissue, and has shown feasibility for
   objective assessment of bone microarchitecture (BMA). This integrated
   QPA platform can assess both bone mass and microstructure simultaneously
   without involving invasive biopsy or ionizing radiation. Since QPA is
   non-ionizing, non-invasive, and has sufficient penetration in both soft
   tissue and bone, it has unique advantages for clinical translation.}},

Abstract = {{Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder resulting in
   defective collagen or collagen-associated proteins and fragile, brittle
   bones. To date, therapies to improve OI bone mass, such as
   bisphosphonates, have increased bone mass in the axial skeleton of OI
   patients, but have shown limited effects at reducing long bone
   fragility. Sclerostin antibody (SclAb), currently in clinical trials for
   osteoporosis, stimulates bone formation and may have the potential to
   reduce long bone fracture rates in OI patients. Scl-Ab has been
   investigated as an anabolic therapy for OI in the Brtl/+ mouse model of
   moderately severe Type IV OI. While Scl-Ab increases long bone mass in
   the Brtl/+ mouse, it is not known whether material properties and
   composition changes also occur. Here, we report on the effects of Scl-Ab
   on wild type and Brtl/+ young (3 week) and adult (6 month) male mice.
   Scl-Ab was administered over 5 weeks (25mg/kg, 2x/week). Raman
   microspectroscopy and nanoindentation are used for bone composition and
   biomechanical bone property measurements in excised bone. Fluorescent
   labels (calcein and alizarin) at 4 time points over the entire treatment
   period are used to enable measurements at specific tissue age.
   Differences between wild type and Brtl/+ groups included variations in
   the mineral and matrix lattices, particularly the phosphate v1,
   carbonate v1, and the v(CC) proline and hydroxyproline stretch
   vibrations. Results of Raman spectroscopy corresponded to
   nanoindentation findings which indicated that old bone (near midcortex)
   is stiffer (higher elastic modulus) than new bone. We compare and
   contrast mineral to matrix and carbonate to phosphate ratios in young
   and adult mice with and without treatment.}},

Abstract = {{We previously introduced photoacoustic imaging to detect blood vessels
   surrounded by bone and thereby eliminate the deadly risk of carotid
   artery injury during endonasal, transsphenoidal surgeries. Light would
   be transmitted through an optical fiber attached to the surgical drill,
   while a transcranial probe placed on the temporal region of the skull
   receives photoacoustic signals. This work quantifies changes in
   photoacoustic image contrast as the sphenoid bone is drilled. Frontal
   bone from a human adult cadaver skull was cut into seven 3 cm x 3 cm
   chips and sanded to thicknesses ranging 1-4 mm. For 700-940 nm
   wavelengths, the average optical transmission through these specimens
   increased from 19\% to 44\% as bone thickness decreased, with
   measurements agreeing with Monte Carlo simulations within 5\%. These
   skull specimens were individually placed in the optical pathway of a 3.5
   mm diameter, cylindrical, vessel-mimicking photoacoustic target, as the
   laser wavelength was varied between 700-940 nm. The mean optical
   insertion loss and photoacoustic image contrast loss due to the bone
   specimens were 56-80\% and 46-79\%, respectively, with the majority of
   change observed when the bone was <= 2 mm thick. The decrease in
   contrast is directly proportional to insertion loss over this thickness
   range by factors of 0.8-1.1 when multiple wavelengths are considered.
   Results suggest that this proportional relationship may be used to
   determine the amount of bone that remains to be drilled when the
   thickness is 2 mm or less.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoporosis is a progressive bone disease that is characterized by a
   decrease in bone mass and deterioration in microarchitecture. This study
   investigates the feasibility of characterizing bone microstructure by
   analyzing the frequency spectrum of the photoacoustic signals from the
   bone. Modeling and numerical simulation of photoacoustic signals and
   their frequency-domain analysis were performed on trabecular bones with
   different mineral densities. The resulting quasi-linear photoacoustic
   spectra were fit by linear regression, from which spectral parameter
   slope can be quantified. The modeling demonstrates that, at an optical
   wavelength of 685 nm, bone specimens with lower mineral densities have
   higher slope. Preliminary experiment on osteoporosis rat tibia bones
   with different mineral contents has also been conducted. The finding
   from the experiment has a good agreement with the modeling, both
   demonstrating that the frequency-domain analysis of photoacoustic
   signals can provide objective assessment of bone microstructure and
   deterioration. Considering that photoacoustic measurement is
   non-ionizing, non-invasive, and has sufficient penetration in both
   calcified and non-calcified tissues, this new technology holds unique
   potential for clinical translation.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of an innovative biomedical diagnostic technique,
   thermal photoacoustic (TPA) measurement, for non-ionizing and
   non-invasive assessment of bone health is investigated. Unlike
   conventional photoacoustic PA methods which are mostly focused on the
   measurement of absolute signal intensity, TPA targets the change in PA
   signal intensity as a function of the sample temperature, i.e. the
   temperature dependent Grueneisen parameter which is closely relevant to
   the chemical and molecular properties in the sample. Based on the
   differentiation measurement, the results from TPA technique is less
   susceptible to the variations associated with sample and system, and
   could be quantified with improved accurately. Due to the fact that the
   PA signal intensity from organic components such as blood changes faster
   than that from non-organic mineral under the same modulation of
   temperature, TPA measurement is able to objectively evaluate bone
   mineral density (BMD) and its loss as a result of osteoporosis. In an
   experiment on well-established rat models of bone loss and preservation,
   PA measurements of rat tibia bones were conducted over a temperature
   range from 37 degrees C to 44 degrees C. The slope of PA signal
   intensity verses temperature was quantified for each specimen. The
   comparison among three groups of specimens with different BMD shows that
   bones with lower BMD have higher slopes, demonstrating the potential of
   the proposed TPA technique in future clinical management of
   osteoporosis.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports a highly efficient, convenient and universal protocol
   for the fabrication of robust antifouling and antibacterial polymeric
   membranes via one-pot cross-linked copolymerization of methyl
   acryloyloxygen ethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC) and poly(ethylene
   glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA). The infrared testing and
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy gave obvious evidence that abundant DMC
   and PEGMA chains had enriched on the membrane surface. The surface and
   cross-sectional SEM images indicated that the addition of DMC and PEGMA
   had a little effect on the membrane roughness and inner structure.
   Meanwhile, the systematic investigations into the water contact angle,
   protein adsorption, ultrafiltration and bacterial inhibition indicated
   that the composite membranes showed improved hydrophilicity, decreased
   protein adsorption, increased water flux and antifouling property, as
   well as greatly enhanced antibacterial ability. Furthermore, it was
   found that the cross-linked copolymerization could further endow the
   composite membrane with multi-chemical properties, for instance the
   charged interface. As a model system, Ag nanoparticle-PDMC multilayers
   were coated onto the positively charged PES-DMC6 membranes via layer by
   layer assembly, and the successful surface coating confirmed their
   versatile ability and also provided a more effective and durable
   antibacterial coating to the composite membranes. All these results
   suggest that the robust antifouling and antibacterial composite
   membranes can be prepared via the proposed one-pot cross-linked
   copolymerization, and it is believed that this approach has great
   potential to be applied in various biomedical or industrial fields where
   antifouling and antibacterial properties are highly demanded.}},

Abstract = {{A vapor sensor comprising a nanoparticle-coated microfabricated
   optofluidic ring resonator (mu OFRR) is introduced. A multilayer film of
   polyether functionalized, thiolate-monolayer-protected gold
   nanoparticles (MPN) was solvent cast on the inner wall of the hollow
   cylindrical SiOx mu OFRR resonator structure, and whispering gallery
   mode (WGM) resonances were generated with a 1550 nm tunable laser via an
   optical fiber taper. Reversible shifts in the WGM resonant wavelength
   upon vapor exposure were detected with a photodetector. The mu OFRR chip
   was connected to a pair of upstream etched-Si chips containing
   PDMS-coated separation mu columns and calibration curves were generated
   from the peak-area responses to five volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
   Calibration curves were linear, and the sensitivities reflected the
   influence of analyte volatility and analyte-MPN functional group
   affinity. Sorption-induced changes in film thickness apparently dominate
   over changes in the refractive index of the film as the determinant of
   responses for all VOCs. Peaks from the MPN-coated mu OFRR were just
   20-50\% wider than those from a flame ionization detector for similar mu
   column separation conditions, reflecting the rapid response of the
   sensor for VOCs. The five VOCs were baseline separated in <1.67 min,
   with detection limits as low as 38 ng.}},

Pages = {{3981-3987}},
Abstract = {{We have constructed micro-fabricated flow sensors that can measure water
   flow rates of 0.1 to 2.0 gallons per minute (GPM), and the experimental
   results we obtained are in good agreement with those from COMSOL
   simulations. Two identical sensors were fabricated on each device with
   an upstream sensor functioning as a temperature sensor, and the voltage
   difference between the two sensors indicating the water flow rate. The
   sensors were constructed on glass substrates, chosen for their low
   price, efficient thermal isolation, and compatibility with current water
   supply systems. The variation of water temperature of the flowing fluid
   from 10 to 50 degrees C was accounted for by normalizing the voltage
   readings. The dimensions of the sensors ranged from 71 mm by 80 mm to
   430 mm by 480 mm with the smaller sensors having a higher sensitivity.
   Sensitivity also increased with increasing input power up to the point
   when boiling occurred. The optimized sensor, which was 71 mm by 80 mm on
   a 3 mm by 3 mm glass substrate, could be operated with only 2.75 mW of
   power in 10 to 50 degrees C water, providing an economic and energy
   efficient method to measure large water flow rates of 0.1-0.5 GPM.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical scaling analysis is conducted to propose nondimensional
   criteria to predict weak and strong ignition regimes for a
   compositionally homogeneous reactant mixture with turbulent velocity and
   temperature fluctuations. This leads to a regime diagram that provides
   guidance on expected ignition behavior based on the thermo-chemical
   properties of the mixture and the flow/scalar field conditions. The
   analysis extends the original Zeldovich's theory by combining the
   turbulent flow and scalar characteristics in terms of the characteristic
   Damkohler and Reynolds numbers of the system, thereby providing unified
   and comprehensive understanding of the physical and chemical mechanisms
   controlling autoignition. Estimated parameters for existing experimental
   measurements in a rapid compression facility show that the regime
   diagram predicts the observed ignition characteristics with good
   fidelity.}},

Abstract = {{The discretization of standard differential and volume integral

   combined field integral equation (VSCFIE) consisting of coupled surface
   combined field integral equations and VIEs to resolve this problem. The
   system leverages equivalence principles to artificially change the sign
   of the effective permittivity of the medium in which the polarization
   currents radiate. Numerical results obtained by analyzing time-harmonic
   TEz scattering from various 2-D layered cylinders suggests that
   discretization of the proposed VSCFIE yields well-conditioned and

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2335-2340}},
Abstract = {{We designed, fabricated, and characterized a monolithically integrated
   optofluidic ring resonator laser that is mechanically, thermally, and
   chemically robust. The entire device, including the ring resonator
   channel and sample delivery microfluidics, was created in a block of
   fused-silica glass using a 3-dimensional femtosecond laser writing
   process. The gain medium, composed of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) dissolved in
   quinoline, was flowed through the ring resonator. Lasing was achieved at
   a pump threshold of approximately 15 mu J mm(-2). Detailed analysis
   shows that the Q-factor of the optofluidic ring resonator is 3.3 x
   10(4), which is limited by both solvent absorption and scattering loss.
   In particular, a Q-factor resulting from the scattering loss can be as
   high as 4.2 x 10(4), suggesting the feasibility of using a femtosecond
   laser to create high quality optical cavities.}},

Abstract = {{Nitride based GaN and InGaN quantum dots are excellent single-photon
   emitters at high temperature owing to their wide bandgap and large

   single-photon emission: InGaN/GaN disk-in-nanowire and InGaN/GaN
   self-organized quantum dot. Single-photon emission under both optical
   and electrical excitation has been observed from a single InGaN quantum
   contained in a GaN nanowire p-n junction. We demonstrate electrically
   driven single-photon emission, with a g((2))(0) = 0.35, from a single
   InGaN quantum dot emitting in the green spectral range (lambda = 520 nm)
   up to 125 K. Additionally, a self-organized InGaN/GaN single quantum dot
   diode was grown and fabricated. Emission from a single quantum dot
   (lambda = 620 nm) shows single-photon emission with g((2))(0) = 0.29 at
   room temperature. On-demand single-photon emission by electrical pumping
   of the quantum dot at an excitation repetition rate of 200 MHz was
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{A silicon-based laser remains an important goal in science and

   Nanowire heterostructures with InGaN/GaN disk-in-nanowire active regions
   were grown on (001) silicon and planarized with parylene, forming a
   composite slab heterostructure supporting a guided mode propagating
   transverse to the growth direction. From this composite slab,
   ridge-geometry lasers were fabricated. Lasers with emission at 533 nm
   (green) and 610 nm (red) are presented here. The lasers are
   characterized by J(th) = 1.76 kA/cm(2) (green) and 2.94kA/cm(2) (red)
   under continuous wave current injection. The green lasers have device
   lifetime of similar to 7000 hrs. Small-signal modulation measurements

   light based on incident wavelength and angle, allowing transmission of
   normally incident light for window visibility and absorption of light at
   elevated angles. Two structures of interest are proposed and described:
   metal nanorods which scatter light via their localized surface plasmon
   resonance properties, and arrays of subwavelength nanopores in a
   dielectric which demonstrate coherent multiple scattering. Both
   structures can potentially be patterned over large areas by
   electrochemical oxidation of aluminum into self assembled nanoporous

Abstract = {{Previously, we introduced a novel and an etch-free solution based
   procedure utilizing a combination of imprinting and inkjet printing for
   developing polymer photonic devices to overcome the limitations of
   conventional polymer photonic device fabrication techniques, such as RIE
   or direct pattern writing. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility
   of developing very large-area photonic systems on both rigid and
   flexible substrates. Specifically, a complete reconfigurable 4-bit
   true-time-delay module, comprising of an array of five interconnected TO
   switches and polymer delay lines, with a dimension of 25 mm x 18 mm is
   developed. Because of the roll-to-roll (R2R) compatibility of the
   employed solution processing techniques, photonic system development
   over large areas at high-throughput on rigid or flexible substrates is
   possible, which will lead to tremendous cost savings. Moreover, these
   devices can be integrated with other printed photonic and electronic
   components, such as light sources, modulators, antennas, etc., on the
   same substrate, thus enabling integrated systems that can be conformably
   integrated on any platform.}},

Title = {{Large-eddy simulations of surface roughness parameter sensitivity to
   canopy-structure characteristics}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{2533-2548}},
Abstract = {{Surface roughness parameters, namely the roughness length and
   displacement height, are an integral input used to model surface fluxes.
   However, most models assume these parameters to be a fixed property of
   plant functional type and disregard the governing structural
   heterogeneity and dynamics. In this study, we use large-eddy simulations
   to explore, in silico, the effects of canopy-structure characteristics
   on surface roughness parameters. We performed a virtual experiment to
   test the sensitivity of resolved surface roughness to four axes of
   canopy structure: (1) leaf area index, (2) the vertical profile of leaf
   density, (3) canopy height, and (4) canopy gap fraction. We found
   roughness parameters to be highly variable, but uncovered positive
   relationships between displacement height and maximum canopy height,
   aerodynamic canopy height and maximum canopy height and leaf area index,
   and eddy-penetration depth and gap fraction. We also found negative
   relationships between aerodynamic canopy height and gap fraction, as
   well as between eddy-penetration depth and maximum canopy height and
   leaf area index. We generalized our model results into a virtual
   ``biometric{''} parameterization that relates roughness length and
   displacement height to canopy height, leaf area index, and gap fraction.
   Using a decade of wind and canopy-structure observations in a site in
   Michigan, we tested the effectiveness of our model-driven biometric
   parameterization approach in predicting the friction velocity over
   heterogeneous and disturbed canopies. We compared the accuracy of these
   predictions with the friction-velocity predictions obtained from the
   common simple approximation related to canopy height, the values
   calculated with large-eddy simulations of the explicit canopy structure
   as measured by airborne and ground-based lidar, two other
   parameterization approaches that utilize varying canopy-structure
   inputs, and the annual and decadal means of the surface roughness
   parameters at the site from meteorological observations. We found that
   the classical representation of constant roughness parameters (in space
   and time) as a fraction of canopy height performed relatively well.
   Nonetheless, of the approaches we tested, most of the empirical
   approaches that incorporate seasonal and interannual variation of
   roughness length and displacement height as a function of the dynamics
   of canopy structure produced more precise and less biased estimates for
   friction velocity than models with temporally invariable parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Bioactive glass nanoparticles (BGNs) have attracted widespread interest
   recently and been explored as the promising drug or gene delivery
   carriers due to their high biocompatibility and tissue repair ability.
   However, the synthesis of monodispersed photoluminescent BGNs and their
   corresponding biomedical applications are still not explored. Here, for
   the first time, we report monodispersed Eu-doped photoluminescent
   bioactive glass nanoparticles (BGN-Eu) and demonstrate their biomedical
   applications for drug delivery and cell imaging. By a long chain amine
   assisted sol-gel method, we synthesized the monodispersed BGN-Eu with
   combined dual functions of bioactivity and luminescence properties, and
   further investigated their physicochemical structure, biomineralization
   activity and biomedical applications. As-prepared BGN-Eu possessed the
   spherical morphology, relatively homogeneous particle size (200 similar
   to 400 nm) and representative red fluorescence emission characteristic
   of Eu3+ at 616 nm. In simulated body fluids (SBFs), the BGN-Eu
   demonstrated excellent bioactivity by inducing biological apatite
   mineralization. BGN-Eu also presented controlled drug (theophylline)
   loading ability and release behavior. The osteoblast (MC3T3) growth was
   significantly enhanced when incubated with different dosages of BGN-Eu,
   suggesting the high biocompatibility. In addition, BGN-Eu was
   successfully used to label the MC3T3 cell by a strong red fluorescence
   with low background noise. Our results suggest the great potential of
   BGN-Eu as multifunctional bioactive nanomaterials for cell imaging and
   bone tissue regeneration applications.}},

Abstract = {{A flexible large area lighting devices have been demonstrated by PDMS
   films. The (polydimethylsiloxane) PDMS films doped with
   organic/inorganic materials. The PDMS film is favorable due to its heat
   stability, good transparency, and flexibility. This study aimed to
   combine both organic and inorganic materials for flexible large area
   lighting applications. The architecture consists of blue LEDs coupled to
   a leaky waveguide that is covered with the PDMS film. The white light
   was generated with the poly (9, 9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole)
   F8BT blended into the PDMS slurry. Organic wavelength conversion
   materials were chosen owing to their ability to decompose in nature. The
   more conventional inorganic phosphors such as YAG are difficult to
   decompose and may present environmental issues which can bring concerns
   in many lighting applications.
   These flexible PDMS films had thicknesses of 100 mu m, 440 mu m, and 980
   mu m. The resulting white light devices had color temperatures of 8944K,
   4863K, and 4429K, respectively. In this study, we have also compared the

   steady electric fields}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{3599-3611}},
Abstract = {{We quantify and model the deposition and crystallization kinetics of
   initially dilute colloidal spheres due to application of a steady,
   direct current electric field in the thin gap between parallel
   electrodes. The system studied is poly(12-hydroxystearic acid)
   (PHSA)-stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) spheres dispersed in
   a mixture of cyclohexylbromide (CHB), decalin, and a low concentration
   of the partially disassociating salt tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC).
   The temporal and spatial evolution of the colloidal volume fraction in
   the similar to 1 mm gap between the electrodes is quantified under
   conditions of both deposition and relaxation by confocal laser scanning
   microscopy (CLSM). During deposition assembly, the spatial dependence of
   the colloid volume fraction approaches steady state at times between
   hundreds of minutes at the lowest electric field strength (as
   characterized by a Peclet number, Pe) and at tens of minutes at higher
   field strengths. During disassembly, the volume fraction relaxes nearly
   exponentially. The kinetics are modeled by adapting a treatment for
   sedimentation (Davis and Russel, Phys. Fluids A, 1989, 1, 82) to the
   case of steady electric fields. The model's predictions show good
   agreement with the measured kinetics at low Pe; however, agreement
   progressively deteriorates with increasing Pe. At low Pe the deposits
   are initially disordered. After an initial delay, 1D crystal growth
   propagates from the electrode surface at rates of several hundred nm
   min(-1). The sharp crystal boundary propagates as a characteristic of
   constant colloidal volume fraction, consistent with an equilibrium
   crystalline phase transition. The results inform operational ranges for
   devices that produce active colloidal matter by reversible assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) elastomers have received
   much attention as promising materials for potential applications in soft
   tissue repair and regeneration, due to their biomimetic viscoelastic
   properties. However, the low strength and the absence of bioactivity
   have limited their potential applications in hard (bone, tooth, tendon
   and ligament) tissue regeneration. Here, we introduced the
   molecular-level silica bioactive glass into the matrix of polymer
   elastomers to prepare bioactive hybrid elastomers (PGSSC) for bone
   tissue regeneration applications. We have shown here that our PGSSC
   provide some advantages over conventional bioactive materials and
   elastomers due to their controlled biomineralization (apatite-forming
   bioactivity), tunable elastic properties and biodegradation, and
   enhanced osteoblast proliferation. The tensile strength and the initial
   modulus of PGSSC hybrid elastomers ranged from 1 to 5 MPa and 2 to 32
   MPa respectively by controlling silica phase contents, which are several
   times higher than pure PGS elastomers. PGSSC elastomers also showed
   enhanced hydrophilicity with contact angle ranging from 75 to 25 degree.
   The biological apatite was formed on the surfaces of PGSSC when soaked
   in simulated body fluid (SBF) for 1 day. The osteoblast (MC3T3)
   demonstrated significantly enhanced proliferation on PGSSC compared with
   PGS. The development of bioactive PGSSC hybrid elastomers may offer a
   new choice for bone tissue repair and regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles with a tendency to phase separate interact with each other
   during a process of either intraparticle phase separation (occurring
   inside the particle) or interparticle phase separation (occurring
   between particles). In this paper, we examine a halfcell consisting of
   two particles to systematically analyze the particle interactions and
   their resulting voltage response at different insertion currents. The
   kinetics of the interactions between nanoparticles is studied for cases
   in which particles undergo interparticle and intraparticle phase
   separation. Our results indicate that the interactions between particles
   in a cell containing only particles that undergo intraparticle phase
   separation are similar to those in a cell containing only particles that
   undergo interparticle phase separation. In both cases, sequential
   transformation occurs at low currents, whereas a simultaneous
   transformation occurs at high currents. However, such transformation
   dynamics changes in cases where the cell contains a mixture of particles
   that undergo interparticle and intraparticle phase separations, which
   exhibits more complex dynamics. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{35033-35041}},
Abstract = {{Copper(II) oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) have found numerous
   applications in electronics, optics, catalysis, energy storage, health,
   and water purification. Controlled synthesis of CuO NPs requires
   information on their nanoscale structure, which is expected to vary
   depending on the size, shape, phase, and most importantly, on the
   surface morphology. In this work, we report a detailed analysis of the
   structure of solid and melted CuO nanoparticles as functions of size and
   temperature at global and local scales, using molecular dynamics
   simulations. Comparisons of simulated X-ray diffraction profiles, mean
   bond lengths, average coordination numbers, and melting points with
   available experimental data support the modeling results. Melting points
   of CuO NPs vary linearly with the reciprocal of the diameters of NPs.
   The long-range order seen in solid nanoparticles with diameters greater
   than 6 nm gradually vanishes as size decreases, indicating the loss of
   translational symmetry of the lattice structure and the emergence of
   amorphous-like structure even below the melting point. Melted
   nanoparticles show liquid-like characteristics with only a short-range
   order. Mean bond lengths and average Cu-O coordination numbers of both
   solid and melted NPs indicate weakening of the structural stabilization
   for smaller NPs that leads to an increased deformation in the local
   atomic arrangement because of the lack of long-range interactions. For
   the cases studied, most of the structural features are independent of
   temperature, with the notable exception of the number of oxygen atoms
   coordinated to Cu. This latter quantity is indeed indicative of melting
   phase transition and can be used to compute the melting point
   accurately. Atoms on the surface of solid NPs show amorphous-like
   behavior even at temperatures well below the melting point of the NPs
   due to the limited coordination environment. This study represents a
   useful step towards the establishment of a structure-property
   relationship for CuO nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design, synthesis, and fundamental
   characterization of a series of Cr and V acetylacetonate (acac)
   complexes for use in redox flow batteries (RFBs). These materials offer
   a significant improvement in theoretical energy density relative to
   state-of-the-art aqueous chemistries. A detailed assessment of the
   solubility, cyclic voltammetry, and charge-discharge behavior of the
   complexes is presented. Their solubilities in acetonitrile vary by more
   than four orders of magnitude based on the structure/substituents on the
   acac ligand. Complexes bearing acac ligands with ester substituents have
   solubilities of up to 1.8 M, a significant improvement over most other
   metal complexes that have been considered for non-aqueous RFB
   applications. While the acac ligand substituents have a dramatic impact
   on solubility, they do not, in most cases, impact the electrochemical
   properties of the complexes. For instance, voltammetry for all of the
   V(acac)(3) derivatives examined exhibit two quasireversible redox events
   separated by approximately 2.1 V. Charge-discharge testing in static
   H-cell and laboratory-scale flow batteries yielded energy densities that
   were consistent with the voltammetry and coulombic and energy
   efficiencies of up to 92\% and 87\%, respectively. Overall, these
   studies provide the basis for the development of structure-function
   relationships that could lead to new and even better performing energy
   storage chemistries in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks have always been designed for monitoring
   physical environments and reporting the obtained data to a central
   collection point, called base station (or sink), which will process and
   analyze them. This type of network consists of tiny, battery-powered
   devices, called sensor nodes, which are able to store and process data,
   and communicate results (wirelessly) to the external world. Furthermore,
   these sensor nodes have the capability of sensing data, such as
   temperature, sound, light, and vibration, to name a few, and sending
   them to the sink. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a set of sensor
   nodes that collaborate to successfully accomplish their monitoring task
   by communicating with each other via multi-hop, wireless links. The
   design of WSNs faces a major problem due to the very scarce resources of
   the sensor nodes, such as battery power (or energy), CPU, and bandwidth,
   to name a few, with energy being the most critical one. It is well known
   that WSNs can be used for a wide variety of applications dealing with
   monitoring (health environments monitoring, seism monitoring), control,
   and surveillance (battlefields surveillance). Most of these applications
   are designed with a goal to extend the network lifetime for as long as
   possible. In this paper, we propose a classification of applications of
   WSNs based on their application domains. Precisely, we focus on five
   application domains, namely healthcare, agriculture, environmental,
   industry, and military. For each application domain, we give an overview
   of a variety of applications of WSNs. Moreover, we describe the main
   hardware and software components that are essential for the design and
   development of this type of network.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{1005-1010}},
Abstract = {{Using a combination of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
   and physics-based degradation models, we find that the early aging of
   small molecular weight organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is due to
   photochemical degradation of the C-60 acceptor layer. Planar and mixed
   boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc)-donor/C-60-acceptor
   heterojunctions show significant changes in their IR absorption spectra
   after aging under illumination, which we find is due to exciton-mediated
   photo-oligomerization of C-60. The consequent decrease in exciton
   diffusion length in the C-60 layer results from a decreased exciton
   lifetime for C-60 oligomers (e.g. C-120 and C-180) compared to that of
   the monomer. The model describes the short-circuit current reduction in
   planar SubPc/C-60 OPV cells during early aging, and explains the lack of
   degradation in analogous mixed heterojunctions.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable elastomers are attractive in soft tissue regeneration due
   to their biomimetic viscoelastic properties and biocompatibility.
   However, conventional elastomers are inherently weak and lack the
   bioactivity required for highly efficient tissue regeneration.
   Silica-based biomaterials have shown high mechanical stiffness and
   special bioactivities including stimulating osteogenesis and
   angiogenesis by enhancing corresponding gene expressions. Here, by a
   facile polymerization, we synthesized a series of silica grafted poly
   (1,8-octanediol-co-citrate) (SPOC) hybrid elastomers with highly tunable
   physicochemical properties and bioactivities. The silica phase was
   successfully grafted to the side chain of POC. The silica phase
   incorporation significantly endowed POC elastomers with highly
   controlled thermal stability, mechanical properties, hydrophilicity,
   biodegradation and biocompatibility. The tensile strength, initial
   modulus and elongation of SPOC hybrid elastomers were highly tunable and
   range from 2-15 MPa, 4-25 MPa and 50-140\% respectively, which is almost
   a four-fold enhancement compared with pure POC elastomers. In addition,
   SPOC elastomers significantly enhanced the proliferation and metabolic
   activities of multiple cell lines including the adipose-derived stem
   cells, fibroblasts, myoblasts and osteoblasts, indicating their high
   biocompatibility. These optimized structures and properties of the
   silica-grafted hybrid elastomers make them promising for soft and hard
   tissue regeneration applications.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin is affecting
   the socio-ecological system, including the residents who depend on the
   basin for drinking water, energy, and commerce. Over the past 50 years,
   air temperatures increased and heavier precipitation events became more
   frequent, and those trends are projected to continue. Climate change is
   expected to impact energy supply and demand, governance, and changes in
   demographics and societal values. More extreme events may exacerbate
   transport of biological and chemical contaminants and invasive species,
   and impact lake levels and water quality. We describe historical trends
   of the regional climate, examine global and regional climate model
   projections, and explore impacts of climate change with other key
   drivers of change defined by the Great Lakes Futures Project Because
   reducing climate-related damages and economic losses is crucial; we
   offer three plausible future scenarios of mitigation and adaptation
   plans. Recommendations to reach a future Utopian scenario require
   immediate actions, such as improvements in energy conservation,
   efficiency and generation, curbs to emissions, preventative
   infrastructure upgrades, and investments in maintaining and monitoring a
   healthy ecosystem. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes

Abstract = {{The direct simulation MonteCarlo method has evolved over 50years into a
   powerful numerical technique for the computation of complex,
   nonequilibrium gas flows. In this context, ``nonequilibrium{''} means
   that the velocity distribution function is not in an equilibrium form
   due to a low number of intermolecular collisions within a fluid element.
   In hypersonic flow, nonequilibrium conditions occur at high altitude and
   in regions of flowfields with small length scales. In this paper, the
   theoretical basis of the direct simulation MonteCarlo technique is
   discussed. In addition, the methods used in direct simulation MonteCarlo
   are described for simulation of high-temperature, real gas effects and
   gas-surface interactions. Several examples of the application of direct
   simulation MonteCarlo to flows around blunt hypersonic vehicles are
   presented to illustrate current capabilities. Areas are highlighted
   where further research on the direct simulation MonteCarlo technique is
   required.}},

Abstract = {{The steps necessary to achieve the strong coupling between a flowfield
   solver and a material response solver are presented. This type of
   coupling is required to accurately capture the complex aerothermodynamic
   physics occurring during hypersonic atmospheric entries. A blowing
   boundary condition for the flowfield solver is proposed. This allows the
   ablating gas calculated by the material response solver to be correctly
   injected in the boundary layer. A moving mesh algorithm for the
   flowfield solver that implicitly enforces the geometric conservation law
   is presented. Using that capability, a mesh movement procedure for
   surface recession and for accurate shock capturing is proposed. The
   entire technique is tested using a material response solver with surface
   ablation and pyrolysis coupled to a hypersonic solver for weakly ionized
   flows in thermochemical nonequilibrium. Results using the reentry
   trajectory of the IRV-2 test vehicle are presented, showing that the
   surface heat fluxes remain accurate as the vehicle geometry and
   freestream conditions change.}},

   crossbar memory arrays}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4964-4970}},
Abstract = {{The conduction mechanism of a Pd/TaOx/Ta/Pd selector device, which
   exhibits high non-linearity (similar to 10(4)) and excellent uniformity,
   has been systematically investigated by current-voltage-temperature
   characterization. The measurement and simulation results indicate two
   dominant processes of selector current at opposite biases: thermionic
   emission and tunnel emission. The current-voltage-temperature behaviors
   of the selector can be well explained using the Simmons' trapezoidal
   energy barrier model. The TaOx-based selective layer was further
   integrated with a HfO2-based resistive switching layer to form a
   selector-less resistive random access memory (RRAM) device structure.
   The integrated device showed a reliable resistive switching behavior
   with a high non-linearity (similar to 5 x 10(3)) in the low resistance
   state (LRS), which can effectively mitigate the sneak path current issue
   in RRAM crossbar arrays. Evaluations of a crossbar array based on these
   selector-less RRAM cells show less than 4\% degradation in read margin
   for arrays up to 1 Mbit in size. These results highlight the different
   conduction mechanisms in selector device operation and will provide
   insight into continued design and optimization of RRAM arrays.}},

Abstract = {{In the study of interphase chromosome organization, genome-wide
   chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) maps are often generated using
   2-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures. These 2D cells have morphological
   deviations from cells that exist in 3-dimensional (3D) tissues in vivo,
   and may not maintain the same chromosome conformation. We used Hi-C maps
   to test the extent of differences in chromosome conformation between
   human fibroblasts grown in 2D cultures and those grown in 3D spheroids.
   Significant differences in chromosome conformation were found between 2D
   cells and those grown in spheroids. Intra-chromosomal interactions were
   generally increased in spheroid cells, with a few exceptions, while
   inter-chromosomal interactions were generally decreased. Overall,
   chromosomes located closer to the nuclear periphery had increased
   intra-chromosomal contacts in spheroid cells, while those located more
   centrally had decreased interactions. This study highlights the
   necessity to conduct studies on the topography of the interphase nucleus
   under conditions that mimic an in vivo environment.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{A488-A514}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable low rank matrix
   completion algorithm. The key idea is to extend the orthogonal matching
   pursuit method from the vector case to the matrix case. We further
   propose an economic version of our algorithm by introducing a novel
   weight updating rule to reduce the time and storage complexity. Both
   versions are computationally inexpensive for each matrix pursuit
   iteration and find satisfactory results in a few iterations. Another
   advantage of our proposed algorithm is that it has only one tunable
   parameter, which is the rank. It is easy to understand and to use by the
   user. This becomes especially important in large-scale learning
   problems. In addition, we rigorously show that both versions achieve a

   known results. We also empirically compare the proposed algorithms with
   several state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms on many real-world

Title = {{Slow and steady cell shrinkage reduces osmotic stress in bovine and
   murine oocyte and zygote vitrification}},
Journal = {{HUMAN REPRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{37-45}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{STUDY QUESTION: Does the use of a new cryoprotectant agent (CPA)
   exchange protocol designed to minimize osmotic stress improve oocyte or
   zygote vitrification by reducing sublethal cryodamage?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: The use of a new CPA exchange protocol made possible by
   automated microfluidics improved oocyte and zygote vitrification with
   superior morphology as indicated by a smoothercell surface, higher
   sphericity, higher cytoplasmic lipid retention, less cytoplasmic leakage
   and higher developmental competence compared with conventional methods.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The use of more `steps' of CPA exposure during
   the vitrification protocol increases cryosurvival and development in the
   bovine model. However, such an attempt to eliminate osmotic stress is
   limited by the practicality of performing numerous precise pipetting
   steps in a short amount of time.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Murine meiotically competent germinal
   vesicle intact oocytes and zygotes were harvested from the antral
   follicles in ovaries and ampulla, respectively. Bovine ovaries were
   obtained from a local abattoir at random stages of the estrous cycle. A
   total of 110 murine oocytes, 802 murine zygotes and 52 bovine oocytes
   were used in this study.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Microfluidic devices were
   fabricated using conventional photo-and soft-lithography. CPAs used were
   7.5\% ethylene glycol (EG) and 7.5\% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for
   equilibration solution and 15\% EG, 15\% DMSO and 0.5 M sucrose for
   vitrification solution. End-point analyses include mathematical modeling
   using Kedem-Katchalsky equations, morphometrics assessed by conventional
   and confocal microscopy, cytoplasmic lipid quantification by nile red
   staining, cytoplasmic leakage quantification by fluorescent dextran
   intercalation and developmental competence analysis by 96 h embryo
   culture and blastomere quantification.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The automated microfluidics
   protocol decreased the shrinkage rate of the oocyte and zygote by 13.8
   times over its manual pipetting alternative. Oocytes and zygotes with a
   lower shrinkage rate during CPA exposure experienced less osmotic stress
   resulting in better morphology, higher cell quality and improved
   developmental competence. This microfluidic procedure resulted in murine
   zygotes with a significantly smoother cell surface (P < 0.001), more
   spherical cellular morphology (P < 0.001), increased cytoplasmic lipid
   retention in vitrified and warmed bovine oocytes (P < 0.01), decreased
   membrane perforations and cytoplasmic leakage in CPA-exposed murine
   zygotes (P < 0.05) and improved developmental competence of vitrified
   and warmed murine zygotes (P < 0.05) than CPA exposure using the current
   clinically used manual pipetting method.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: It is necessary to design the
   microfluidic device to be more user-friendly for widespread use.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The theory and approach of
   eliminating osmotic stress by decreasing shrinkage rate is complementary
   to the prevalent osmotic stress theory in cryobiology which focuses on a
   minimum cell volume at which the cells shrink. The auto-microfluidic
   protocol described here has immediate applications for improving animal
   and human oocyte, zygote and embryo cryopreservation. On a fundamental
   level, the clear demonstration that at the same minimum cell volume,
   cell shrinkage rate affects sublethal damage should be broadly useful
   for cryobiology.}},

Abstract = {{A new type of highly stable, transparent and flexible hybrid electrode
   has been developed by integrating the encapsulation of a silver
   nanowires (AgNWs) network by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with a single-layer
   graphene on a flexible substrate. Compared with commercial indium tin

   electrode formulation was found to exhibit excellent optical and
   electrical properties (84.0\% at 550 nm R-S = 14.1 Omega square(-1)).
   Moreover, the PVA encapsulated-AgNWs-graphene hybrid electrode on a
   flexible substrate shows superior mechanical flexibility, reliability
   and long-term stability due to the multi-functional effects of PVA as
   the encapsulation layer. Finally, we employ this hybrid electrode to
   construct a flexible cholesteric liquid crystals (Ch-LCs) device, where
   the PVA layer in hybrid formation could be used as the orientation
   layer. This Ch-LCs device exhibits an impressive electrical-optical
   performance, demonstrating its potential as a transparent and

Abstract = {{Non-aqueous electrolytes are stable over wide electrochemical potential
   windows, generally >2 V, and therefore hold promise for enabling higher
   energy and power density redox flow batteries (RFBs). Nevertheless, the
   development of non-aqueous RFBs is at an early stage and significant
   research efforts are needed to demonstrate non-aqueous RFBs with
   performance characteristics that exceed those of aqueous RFBs. The
   membrane or separator is a critical component that to a great extent
   determines the performance of RFB systems for practical applications. In
   this work, the performance of a RFB was evaluated with Nafion 1035
   membranes and Daramic 175 SLImicroporous separators. The non-aqueous
   electrolyte was based on vanadium (III) acetylacetonate. This chemistry
   possesses two couples over similar to 2.2 V. Charge-discharge cycles
   were performed in a RFB at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Coulombic
   and energy efficiencies of 91\% and 80\% were achieved using the Nafion
   membrane. A similar RFB using the Daramic microporous separator achieved
   columbic and energy efficiencies of 73\% and 68\%, respectively. The
   source of capacity decay during multiple charge-discharge cycles was
   also investigated. The loss in the capacity was related to the poor
   chemical stability of the vanadium acetylacetonate in the positive
   electrolyte during battery cycling. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by

Title = {{Fracture fabrication of a multi-scale channel device that efficiently
   captures and linearizes DNA from dilute solutions}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1329-1334}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a simple technique for patterning channels on
   elastomeric substrates, at two distinct scales of depth, through the use
   of controlled fracture. Control of channel depth is achieved by the
   careful use of different layers of PDMS, where the thickness and
   material properties of each layer, as well as the position of the layers
   relative to one another, dictate the depth of the channels formed. The
   system created in this work consists of a single `deep' channel, whose
   width can be adjusted between the micron-and the nano-scale by the
   controlled application or removal of a uniaxial strain, and an array of
   `shallow' nano-scale channels oriented perpendicular to the `deep'
   channel. The utility of this system is demonstrated through the
   successful capture and linearization of DNA from a dilute solution by
   executing a two-step `concentrate-then-linearize' procedure. When the
   `deep' channel is in its open state and a voltage is applied across the
   channel network, an overlapping electric double layer forms within the
   `shallow' channel array. This overlapping electric double layer was used
   to prevent passage of DNA into the `shallow' channels when the DNA
   molecules migrate into the junctional region by electrophoresis. Release
   of the applied strain then allows the `deep' channel to return to its
   closed state, reducing the cross-sectional area of this channel from the
   micro- to the nano-scale. The resulting hydrodynamic flow and
   nano-confinement effects then combine to efficiently uncoil and trap the
   DNA in its linearized form. By adopting this strategy, we were able to
   overcome the entropic barriers associated with capturing and linearizing
   DNA derived from a dilute solution.}},

Abstract = {{The ignition and combustion characteristics of the hydrogen plume issued
   from two pylon-type injectors in a Mach 2.4, high-enthalpy airflow are
   presented. Specifically, the focus of the study is on the effects of the
   imposed interaction and subsequent dynamics of a system of selected
   supersonic streamwise vortices on the reacting plume morphology and its
   evolution. The design phase of the experimental campaign was carried out
   with a reduced-order model, with the goal of identifying peculiar
   interactions among streamwise vortical structures introduced in the flow
   of interest. Two vortex interaction modes have been selected and later
   implemented using ramp-type vortex generators positioned symmetrically
   and asymmetrically on the pylon injectors, as prescribed by the results
   of the simulations reported here. Hydrogen/air combustion experiments,
   aimed at investigating the selected cases, were conducted in the
   expansion tube facility of the High-Temperature Gas Dynamics Laboratory
   at Stanford University. Stagnation enthalpy of 2.8MJ/kg, static
   temperature of 1400K, and static pressure of 40kPa were the chosen test
   conditions. Hydrogen at 300K was delivered with two different total
   injection pressures. The supersonic combustion, ignition, and
   flameholding characteristics were documented with schlieren photography,
   OH{*} chemiluminescence, and instantaneous OH radicals planar
   laser-induced fluorescence. The evolution of the reactive vortical
   system was probed in cross-sectional planes at a distance of 1.8, 4.3,
   7.6, and 10.7cm from the fuel exit plane. The results are thoroughly
   analyzed and the marked difference in the plume morphology between the
   two cases is explained. The similarities between the injectant's
   predicted plumes and the measured distribution of OH radicals across the
   surveyed planes allow for an interpretation of the results based on
   supersonic vortex dynamics considerations.}},

Title = {{A bead-spring model for running and tumbling of flagellated swimmers:
   detailed predictions compared to experimental data for E-coli}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{1572-1581}},
Abstract = {{To study the swimming of the multi-flagellated bacterium Escherichia
   coli, we deploy a bead-spring hydrodynamic model (Watari and Larson
   2010), whose body and flagellar geometry, motor torques, and motor
   reversals are adjusted to match the experimental observations of the
   Berg group (Turner et al. 2000; Darnton et al. 2007) during both running
   and tumbling of the bacterium. In this model, hydrodynamic interactions,
   which drive swimming, flagellar bundling, and unbundling during swimming
   and tumbling, are imposed by treating the beads as Stokeslets, imposing
   torques and counter-torques on the body and flagellum at the flexible
   joint connecting them to represent the action of motor, and using the
   Rotne-Prager tensor to model their hydrodynamic interactions with other
   beads. We explore the behavior of coarse-grained (60-bead) and refined
   (120-bead) versions of the model, and show that predictions of running
   speed, helical and body rotation rates, body wobble rates and angles,
   average tumbling angles, range of tumbling angles, and flagellar
   re-bundling times are in good agreement with experimental observations
   by Berg and coworkers. We find that variation in tumbling angle arises
   from variation in flagellar number and location on the bacterial body,
   variations in polymorphic transitions of the filaments, and especially
   from variations in the duration of the tumbling time, which is roughly
   linearly correlated with tumbling time up to tumbling angles of around
   40-50 degrees and more weakly thereafter. The accuracy of the model
   suggests its usefulness for future studies of swimming of other
   flagellated swimmers, for predictions of collective phenomena, and for
   tuning parameters of coarsergrained swimmer models to achieve greater
   realism.}},

   Aerostructural Optimization}},
Journal = {{AIAA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Aerodynamic shape and aerostructural design optimizations that maximize
   the performance at a single flight condition may result in designs with
   unacceptable off-design performance. While considering multiple flight
   conditions in the optimization improves the robustness of the designs,
   there is a need to develop a way of choosing the flight conditions and
   their relative emphases such that multipoint optimizations reflect the
   true objective function. In addition, there is a need to consider
   uncertain missions and flight conditions. To address this, a new
   strategy to formulate multipoint design optimization problems is
   developed that can maximize the aircraft performance over a large number
   of different missions. This new strategy is applied to the high-fidelity
   aerostructural optimization of a long-range twin-aisle aircraft with the
   objective of minimizing the fuel burn over all the missions it performs
   in one year. This is accomplished by determining 25 flight conditions
   and their respective emphases on drag and structural weight that emulate
   the fuel-burn minimization for over 100,000 missions. The design
   optimization is based on the computational fluid dynamics of a full
   aircraft configuration coupled to a detailed finite element model of the
   wing structure, enabling the simultaneous optimization of wing
   aerodynamic shape and structural sizing leading to optimal static
   aeroelastic tailoring. A coupled adjoint method in conjunction with a
   gradient-based optimizer enable optimization with respect to 311 design
   variables subject to 152 constraints. Given the high computational cost
   of the aerostructural analysis, kriging models are used to evaluate the
   multiple missions. The results show that the multipoint optimized design
   reduced the total fuel burn by 6.6\%, while the single-point
   optimization reduced it by only 1.7\%. This capability to analyze large
   numbers of flight conditions and missions and to reduce the multimission
   problem to a multipoint problem could be used with a few modifications
   to minimize the expected value of any objective function given the
   probability density functions of the flight conditions.}},

   hanging drop platform}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{336-344}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional spheroid cultures have become increasingly popular as
   drug screening platforms, especially with the advent of different high
   throughput spheroid forming technologies. However, comparing drug
   efficacy across different cell types in spheroid culture can be
   difficult due to variations in spheroid morphologies and transport
   characteristics. Improving the reproducibility of compact, circular
   spheroids contributes to standardizing and increasing the fidelity of
   the desired gradient profiles in these drug screening three-dimensional
   tissue cultures. In this study we discuss the role that circularity and
   compaction has on spheroids, and demonstrate the impact methylcellulose
   (MethoCel) and collagen additives in the culture media can contribute to
   more compact and circular spheroid morphology. We demonstrate that
   improved spheroid formation is not a simple function of increased
   viscosity of the different macromolecule additives, suggesting that
   other macromolecular characteristics contribute to improved spheroid
   formation. Of the various macromolecular additives tested for hanging
   drop culture, MethoCel provided the most desirable spheroid formation.
   Additionally, the higher viscosity of MethoCel-containing media improved
   the ease of imaging of cellular spheroids within hanging drop cultures
   by reducing motion-induced image blur.}},

Title = {{Identification of the Dynamic Operating Envelope of HCCI Engines Using
   Class Imbalance Learning}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is a futuristic
   automotive engine technology that can significantly improve fuel economy
   and reduce emissions. HCCI engine operation is constrained by combustion
   instabilities, such as knock, ringing, misfires, high-variability
   combustion, and so on, and it becomes important to identify the
   operating envelope defined by these constraints for use in engine
   diagnostics and controller design. HCCI combustion is dominated by
   complex nonlinear dynamics, and a first-principle-based dynamic modeling
   of the operating envelope becomes intractable. In this paper, a machine
   learning approach is presented to identify the stable operating envelope
   of HCCI combustion, by learning directly from the experimental data.
   Stability is defined using thresholds on combustion features obtained
   from engine incylinder pressure measurements. This paper considers
   instabilities arising from engine misfire and high-variability
   combustion. A gasoline HCCI engine is used for generating stable and
   unstable data observations. Owing to an imbalance in class proportions
   in the data set, the models are developed both based on resampling the
   data set (by undersampling and oversampling) and based on a
   cost-sensitive learning method (by overweighting the minority class
   relative to the majority class observations). Support vector machines
   (SVMs) and recently developed extreme learning machines (ELM) are
   utilized for developing dynamic classifiers. The results compared
   against linear classification methods show that cost-sensitive nonlinear
   ELM and SVM classification algorithms are well suited for the problem.
   However, the SVM envelope model requires about 80\% more parameters for
   an accuracy improvement of 3\% compared with the ELM envelope model
   indicating that ELM models may be computationally suitable for the
   engine application. The proposed modeling approach shows that HCCI
   engine misfires and high-variability combustion can be predicted ahead
   of time, given the present values of available sensor measurements,
   making the models suitable for engine diagnostics and control
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Driver intention detection is an important component in human-centric
   driver assistance systems. This article proposes a novel method for
   detecting driver normal and emergency left-or right-lane-changing
   intentions by using driver models based on the queuing network cognitive
   architecture. Driver lane-changing and lane-keeping models are developed
   and used to simulate driver behavior data associated with 5 kinds of
   intentions (i.e., normal and emergency left-or right-lane-changing and
   lane-keeping intentions). The differences between 5 sets of simulated
   behavior data and the collected actual behavior data are computed, and
   the intention associated with the smallest difference is determined as
   the detection outcome. The experimental results from 14 drivers in a
   driving simulator show that the method can detect normal and emergency
   lane-changing intentions within 0.325 s and 0.268 s of the steering
   maneuver onset, respectively, with high accuracy (98.27\% for normal

Abstract = {{Effective treatment of ovarian cancer depends upon the early detection
   of the malignancy. Here, we report on the development of a new
   nanostructured immunosensor for early detection of cancer antigen 125
   (CA-125). A gold electrode was modified with mercaptopropionic acid
   (MPA), and then consecutively conjugated with silica coated gold
   nanoparticles (AuNP@SiO2), CdSe quantum dots (QDs) and anti-CA-125
   monoclonal antibody (mAb). The engineered MPA vertical bar AuNP@SiO(2
   vertical bar)QD vertical bar mAb immunosensor was characterised using
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM),
   cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS). Successive conjugation of AuNP@SiO2, CdSe QD and anti-CA-125 mAb
   onto the gold electrode resulted in sensitive detection of CA-125 with a
   limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0016 U mL(-1) and a linear detection range
   (LDR) of 0-0.1 U mL(-1). Based on the high sensitivity and specificity
   of the immunosensor, we propose this highly stable and reproducible
   biosensor for the early detection of CA-125.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of path planning for a team of unmanned
   aerial vehicles performing surveillance near a friendly base. The
   unmanned aerial vehicles do not possess sensors with automated target
   recognition capability and, thus, rely on communicating with unattended
   ground sensors placed on roads to detect and image potential intruders.
   The problem is motivated by persistent intelligence, surveillance,
   reconnaissance and base defense missions. The problem is formulated and
   shown to be intractable. A heuristic algorithm to coordinate the
   unmanned aerial vehicles during surveillance and pursuit is presented.
   Revisit deadlines are used to schedule the vehicles' paths nominally.
   The algorithm uses detections from the sensors to predict intruders'
   locations and selects the vehicles' paths by minimizing a linear
   combination of missed deadlines and the probability of not intercepting
   intruders. An analysis of the algorithm's completeness and complexity is
   then provided. The effectiveness of the heuristic is illustrated through
   simulations in a variety of scenarios.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{1386-1396}},
Abstract = {{Recent reports of the synthesis and assembly of faceted nanoplates with
   a wide range of shapes and composition motivates the possibility of a
   new class of two-dimensional materials with specific patterns targeted
   for a host of exciting properties. Yet, studies of how nanoplate shape
   controls their assembly knowledge necessary for their inverse design
   from target structures - has been performed for only a handful of
   systems. By constructing a general framework in which many known faceted
   nanoplates may be described in terms of four anisotropy dimensions, we
   discover design rules to guide future synthesis and assembly. We study
   via Monte Carlo simulations attractive polygons whose shape is altered
   systematically under the following four transformations: faceting,
   pinching, elongation and truncation. We report that (i) faceting leads
   to regular porous structures (ii) pinching stabilizes complex structures
   such as dodecagonal quasicrystals (iii) elongation leads to asymmetric
   phase behavior, where low and high aspect ratio nanoplates self-assemble
   completely different structures and (iv) low and high degrees of
   truncation transform a complex self-assembler into a disk-like
   assembler, providing design ideas that could lead to switchable
   structures. We provide important insight into how the shape and
   attractive interactions of a nanoplate can be exploited or designed to
   target specific classes of structures, including space-filling, porous,
   and complex tilings.}},

Abstract = {{We review constitutive modeling of solutions and melts of linear
   polymers, focusing on changes in rheological behavior in shear and
   extensional flow as the concentration increases from unentangled dilute,
   to entangled, to dense melt. The rheological changes are captured by
   constitutive equations, prototypes of which are the FENE-P model for
   unentangled solutions and the DEMG model for entangled solutions and
   melts. From these equations, and supporting experimental data, for
   dilute solutions, the extensional viscosity increases with the strain
   rate from the low-strain rate to the high-strain rate asymptote, but in
   the densely entangled state, the high-strain rate viscosity is lower
   than the low-shear rate value, especially when orientation-dependent
   friction is accounted for. In shearing flow, shear thinning increases
   dramatically as the entanglement density increases, which can eventually
   lead to a shear-banding inhomogeneity. Recent improvements in
   constitutive modeling are paving the way for robust and accurate
   numerical simulations of polymer fluid mechanics and industrial
   processing of polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic waves carry information about their source and collect
   information about their environment as they propagate. This article
   reviews how these information-carrying and -collecting features of
   acoustic waves that travel through fluids can be exploited for remote
   sensing. In nearly all cases, modern acoustic remote sensing involves
   array-recorded sounds and array signal processing to recover
   multidimensional results. The application realm for acoustic remote
   sensing spans an impressive range of signal frequencies (10(-2) to 10(7)
   Hz) and distances (10(-2) to 10(7) m) and involves biomedical ultrasound
   imaging, nondestructive evaluation, oil and gas exploration, military
   systems, and Nuclear Test Ban Treaty monitoring. In the past two
   decades, approaches have been developed to robustly localize remote
   sources; remove noise and multipath distortion from recorded signals;
   and determine the acoustic characteristics of the environment through
   which the sound waves have traveled, even when the recorded sounds
   originate from uncooperative sources or are merely ambient noise.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{335-341}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{In previous literature, it has been reported that over 50\% of all
   energy consumed in buildings occurs during non-working hours.
   Unfortunately, to the best of the authors' knowledge, studies to date
   using field-collected data have only investigated energy consumed during
   periods of non-occupancy in non-domestic buildings and little is known
   regarding this quantity of energy in households. The work presented in
   this paper bridges this information gap and contributes to the
   literature by presenting a first look into this quantity in households.
   In a yearlong investigation of seven dormitories, hourly occupancy data
   and electricity consumption is combined and analyzed using numerous
   statistical methods to discover the amount of energy that is expended in
   unoccupied households. Across the seasons, the average household
   consumed between 27.5\% and 31.5\% of all energy while unoccupied. This
   quantity in individual rooms fluctuated from under 4\% to over 80\%.
   Differences in occupant behavior, along with time spent unoccupied, can
   explain the differences in this quantity among the households. Further,
   no meaningful relationship was found between total energy consumption
   and percentage of energy spent in empty rooms for individuals. High and
   low energy users both spent electricity while away from home in
   proportion to his/her consumption. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Providing direct communications among a rapidly growing number of
   wireless devices within the coverage area of a cellular system is an
   attractive way of exploiting the proximity among them to enhance
   coverage and spectral and energy efficiency. However, such
   device-to-device (D2D) communications create a new type of interference
   in cellular systems, calling for rigorous system analysis and design to
   both protect mobile users (MUs) and guarantee the connectivity of
   devices. Motivated by the potential advantages of cognitive radio (CR)
   technology in detecting and exploiting underutilized spectrum, we
   investigate CR-assisted D2D communications in a cellular network as a
   viable solution for D2D communications, in which devices access the
   network with mixed overlay-underlay spectrum sharing. Our comprehensive
   analysis reveals several engineering insights useful to system design.
   We first derive bounds of pivotal performance metrics. For a given
   collision probability constraint, as the prime spectrum-sharing
   criterion, we also derive the maximum allowable density of devices. This
   captures the density of MUs and that of active macro base stations.
   Limited in spatial density, devices may not have connectivity among
   them. Nevertheless, it is shown that for the derived maximum allowable
   density, one should judiciously push a portion of devices into receiving
   mode in order to preserve the connectivity and to keep the isolation
   probability low. Furthermore, upper bounds on the cellular coverage
   probability are obtained incorporating load-based power allocation for
   both path-loss and fading-based cell association mechanisms, which are
   fairly accurate and consistent with our in-depth simulation results.
   Finally, implementation issues are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma-in-water based technological approaches offer great potential to
   addressing a wide range of contaminants threatening the safety of
   freshwater reserves. Widespread application of plasma-based
   technologies, however require a better understanding of plasma formation
   processes in water and the nature of the plasma-driven chemistry in
   solution. In this paper, we survey the scope of the threat to freshwater
   via contamination from a variety of sources, the status of conventional
   treatment technologies, the promise of plasma-based water purification,
   and the pathway to understanding plasma formation in water through the
   study of single bubble breakdown physics. Plasma formation-in bubbles
   lie at the heart of plasma formation in liquid water. We present
   findings from ongoing research at the University of Michigan aimed at
   understanding the nature of plasma formation in bubbles, which provides
   an avenue for not only understanding breakdown conditions, but also
   insight in reducing the magnitude of the breakdown voltage. These
   experiments also establish an approach to a standardized apparatus for
   the study of plasma discharges in bubbles. We also discuss approaches to
   controlling plasma-induced chemistry in liquid water. (C) 2015 The Japan

Abstract = {{Voltage and capacity fading of layer structured lithium and manganese
   rich (LMR) transition metal oxide is directly related to the structural
   and composition evolution of the material during the cycling of the
   battery. However, understanding such evolution at atomic level remains
   elusive. On the basis of atomic level structural imaging, elemental
   mapping of the pristine and cycled samples, and density functional
   theory calculations, it is found that accompanying the hoping of Li ions
   is the simultaneous migration of Ni ions toward the surface from the
   bulk lattice, leading to the gradual depletion of Ni in the bulk lattice
   and thickening of a Ni enriched surface reconstruction layer (SRL).
   Furthermore, Ni and Mn also exhibit concentration partitions within the
   thin layer of SRL in the cycled samples where Ni is almost depleted at
   the very surface of the SRL, indicating the preferential dissolution of
   Ni ions in the electrolyte. Accompanying the elemental composition
   evolution, significant structural evolution is also observed and
   identified as a sequential phase transition of C2/m -> I41 -> Spinel.
   For the first time, it is found that the surface facet terminated with
   pure cation/anion is more stable than that with a mixture of cation and
   anion. These findings firmly established how the elemental species in
   the lattice of LMR cathode transfer from the bulk lattice to surface
   layer and further into the electrolyte, clarifying the long-standing
   confusion and debate on the structure and chemistry of the surface layer
   and their correlation with the voltage fading and capacity decaying of
   LMR cathode. Therefore, this work provides critical insights for design
   of cathode materials with both high capacity and voltage stability
   during cycling.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study is carried out of the electrochemical
   characteristics of electrodes made from pure silicon (Si), doped-silicon
   (doped-Si) particles and doped-silicon-silver (doped-Si-Ag) composite
   particles. Doped-Si particles of 10-20 mu m are obtained by mechanically
   crushing the silicon wafers, followed by sieving, and the doped-Si-Ag
   composite particles was prepared by self-selective electroless
   deposition. The Ag coating on doped-Si provides improved overall
   electrical conductivity that enables a better charge transfer.
   Measurements show that the doped-Si-Ag composite anode give the best
   electrochemical performance, with the lowest impedance and improved
   cyclability, and this is followed by the electrodes of doped-Si and pure
   Si. Moreover, the composite electrode has a stable discharge capacity of
   1300 mAhrg(-1) for more than 100 cycles, which is attributed to a good
   electrical integrity, while the pure and doped-Si electrodes degraded in
   less than 40 cycles. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Reducing Soot Emissions in a Diesel Series Hybrid Electric Vehicle Using
   a Power Rate Constraint Map}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{2-12}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers a diesel series hybrid electric vehicle (SHEV) and
   proposes the utilization of an engine-generator power rate constraint
   map to reduce soot emissions without a significant compromise in fuel
   economy. Specifically, model predictive control (MPC) is used to split
   the vehicle power demand between the engine-generator unit and the
   battery. To achieve a reduction in soot, the engine-generator power rate
   is constrained. Unlike existing strategies, the power rate limit is not
   a fixed value but varies, depending on the power level, resulting in a
   map. This constraint map is designed by formulating the soot emission
   reduction problem as an optimization problem, which is solved through a
   three-step offline discrete optimization process. The optimization
   relies on a quasi-static soot emissions map that captures the trends,
   even during transients, but underestimates the magnitudes. Therefore, to
   evaluate the performance of the MPC-based power management with the
   power rate constraint map, experiments are conducted through an
   engine-in-the-loop simulation framework. Experimental results show that
   compared with a constant power rate constraint, soot emissions can be
   reduced by 44.5\% while compromising fuel economy by only 0.3\% through
   the proposed approach. As a tradeoff, the ampere-hour (Ah) processed in
   the battery, which is a variable that has been shown to correlate with
   battery capacity loss, increases by 5.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Energetic radiation can cause dramatic changes in the physical and
   chemical properties of actinide materials, degrading their performance
   in fission-based energy systems. As advanced nuclear fuels and
   wasteforms are developed, fundamental understanding of the processes
   controlling radiation damage accumulation is necessary. Here we report
   oxidation state reduction of actinide and analogue elements caused by
   high-energy, heavy ion irradiation and demonstrate coupling of this
   redox behaviour with structural modifications. ThO2, in which thorium is
   stable only in a tetravalent state, exhibits damage accumulation
   processes distinct from those of multivalent cation compounds CeO2 (Ce3+
   and Ce4+) and UO3 (U4+, U5+ and U6+). The radiation tolerance of these
   materials depends on the efficiency of this redox reaction, such that
   damage can be inhibited by altering grain size and cation valence
   variability. Thus, the redox behaviour of actinide materials is
   important for the design of nuclear fuels and the prediction of their
   performance.}},

Title = {{A dendrite-suppressing composite ion conductor from aramid nanofibres}},
Journal = {{Nature Communications}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Dendrite growth threatens the safety of batteries by piercing the
   ion-transporting separators between the cathode and anode. Finding a
   dendrite-suppressing material that combines high modulus and high ionic
   conductance has long been considered a major technological and materials
   science challenge. Here we demonstrate that these properties can be
   attained in a composite made from Kevlar-derived aramid nanofibres
   assembled in a layer-by-layer manner with poly(ethylene oxide).
   Importantly, the porosity of the membranes is smaller than the growth
   area of the dendrites so that aramid nanofibres eliminate `weak links'
   where the dendrites pierce the membranes. The aramid nanofibre network
   suppresses poly(ethylene oxide) crystallization detrimental for ion
   transport, giving a composite that exhibits high modulus, ionic
   conductivity, flexibility, ion flux rates and thermal stability.
   Successful suppression of hard copper dendrites by the composite ion
   conductor at extreme discharge conditions is demonstrated, thereby
   providing a new approach for the materials engineering of solid ion
   conductors.}},

Abstract = {{The decomposition of ortho-benzyne radicals (o-C6H4), generated from the
   dissociation of a new precursor, fluorobenzene (C6H5F), has been
   investigated in a diaphragmless shock tube in a combined laser schlieren
   densitometry, LS, (P-2 = 30 +/- 2, 59 +/- 3, 121 +/- 5 Torr, 2050 < T-2
   < 2980)/time-of-flight mass spectrometry, TOF-MS (P-5 = 1150 +/- 200
   Torr, 2300 < T-5 < 2800 K) study. The LS density gradient profiles were
   simulated, and excellent agreement was found between simulations and
   experimental profiles. Rate coefficients for C6H5F -> o-C6H4 + HF,
   o-C6H4 -> C4H2 + C2H2, and o-C6H4 -> C6H3 + H were obtained. Good
   agreement with Xu et al. {[} Proc. Combust. Inst., 31(2007) 231-239]
   with respect to the o-benzyne dissociation branching ratio was found.
   However a strong pressure dependence was also observed in o-benzyne
   dissociation which was not seen by Xu et al. For o-C6H4 -> C4H2 + C2H2:
   k(2a,) (120Torr) = (1.2 + 0.4) x 10(63) T-14.27 exp(-52,710/T)
   k(2a,60Torr) = (1.4 + 0.5) x 10(60) T-13.595 exp(-50,538/T),
   k(2a,30Torr) = (4.0 +/- 1.3) x 10(57) T-13.015 exp(-48,628/T) s(-1). The
   inclusion of high temperature o-benzyne abstraction reactions is
   necessary to simulate the reacting system, and we report estimates of
   the rate of o-C6H4 + C6H5F. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute. Published

Title = {{The effect of support fibers on micro-convection in droplet combustion
   experiments}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1709-1716}},
Abstract = {{This study reports experimental evidence of gas phase micro-convection
   induced by support fibers used in droplet combustion experimentation.
   Soot aggregates formed during combustion of n-octane and n-decane
   droplets (initial diameters ranging from 0.5 mm to 5 mm) provide natural
   seeds to reveal the thermal and flow asymmetries involved. The
   experiments are carried out in an environment that reduces the influence
   of forced and buoyant convection for both free-floating (unsupported)
   and fiber-supported droplets. Under these conditions, the soot trapping
   patterns (due to a balance of thermophoretic and flow-induced drag)
   would be spherical. However, this situation is only observed for
   unsupported droplets, or for fiber-supported droplets when the fiber is
   small relative to the droplet diameter. For D-o < 1 mm a ground based
   drop tower employed two 14 mu m diameter SiC fibers to fix the droplet's
   position during burning; unsupported droplets were also examined. For
   D-o > 1 mm the International Space Station provided capabilities for
   anchoring test droplets onto a single 80 mu m SiC fiber, and for
   deploying unsupported droplets. Results clearly indicate that a
   non-symmetric gas flow field exists in some cases (i.e., for 1 mm < D-o
   < 3 mm, with an 80 mu m fiber) near to where the fiber enters the
   droplet. This gas motion originates from the presence of the fiber that
   introduces asymmetries in the temperature and flow fields resulting in
   localized force imbalances on the soot particles, which cause vortical
   flow patterns near the fiber. This may in part be explained by flow
   asymmetries induced by droplet shape distortions coupled with heat
   exchanges between the fiber and surrounding gas and conduction into the
   droplet, resulting in a Marangoni flow near the droplet surface. For
   very small fibers (or for unsupported droplets) spherical soot shells
   are found suggesting that no thermal and flow asymmetries exist. (C)

Abstract = {{We have combined experimental and theoretical approaches to gain new
   insight into the mechanisms of PAH growth and soot formation. The
   experimental approach involves aerosol-mass spectrometry in conjunction
   with vacuum-ultraviolet photoionization of volatile species vaporizing
   from particles sampled from an Ar-diluted C2H2/O-2 counter-flow
   diffusion flame at nearly atmospheric pressure (700 Torr). We recorded
   aerosol mass spectra at different distances from the fuel outlet for
   fixed ionization energies and in a fixed position while tuning the
   photoionization energy. The mass spectra contain a large distribution of
   peaks, highlighting the importance of small building blocks and showing
   a variety of chemical species that extends beyond the traditional
   classification of PAHs based on thermodynamic stability. In addition, we
   performed stochastic simulations of PAH growth in the flame in order to
   provide better insight into the chemical composition of species
   associated with peaks in the measured mass spectra. These simulations
   were conducted using a stochastic nanoparticle simulator (SNAPS).
   Synthesis of experimental and simulated results showed that peaks in the
   observed mass spectra generally consisted of a mixture of PAH isomers.
   At m/z = 154 and 202, for example, experiments and simulations suggested
   that additional isomers than biphenyl and pyrene are important.
   Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of odd-carbon numbered
   species and complex growth paths. The experimental results suggest that
   species of higher masses can build up concentration ahead of species of
   lower masses. Our experimental results show, for example, that the peak
   at m/z = 278 appears closer to the burner outlet than the peak at m/z =
   202, i.e., suggesting that a single monotonic growth mechanism is not
   enough. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Soot particles are a significant pollutant formed as the result of
   incomplete combustion. Particle nucleation significantly impacts the
   formation and morphology of soot particles, yet remains a key knowledge
   gap. To elucidate the process of nucleation, we have investigated the
   thermodynamic stability of dimers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs), towards developing a more comprehensive model for PAH clustering
   behavior. Using a computational methodology based on molecular dynamics
   and well-tempered Metadynamics, we quantified the impact of
   morphological parameters on homo-molecular dimerization, as well as the
   relative size of monomers on the stability of hetero-molecular dimers.
   The results illustrated the substantial impact of PAH mass and geometry
   on the stability of homo-molecular and hetero-molecular dimers at flame
   temperatures. In particular, dimer stability was found to depend most
   strongly on monomer mass, followed by solvent-accessible surface area.
   Additionally, hetero-molecular dimer stability was found to be largely
   determined by the size of the smallest monomer. Identifying
   relationships between PAH morphology and thermodynamic stability is a
   significant step towards a more comprehensive understanding of the
   physical interactions between PAHs. Altogether, this work presents a
   framework for elucidating the clustering behavior of arbitrary PAHs and
   will greatly impact understanding and modeling of particle nucleation
   and growth. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Simultaneous applications of high-speed toluene-LIF thermometry and PIV
   at kHz rates were utilized to investigate the evolution of gas
   temperature stratification imposed from direct-injection of liquid fuel
   within a motored SIDI engine. Temperature imaging was based on the
   two-color detection method that measures the LIF signal ratio from two
   separated wavelength ranges to enable LIF temperature imaging within
   inhomogeneously mixed systems. It was observed that cold gases
   associated with evaporative cooling exist within the regions of dense
   liquid fuel droplet clouds. As droplets disperse, the cold-gas regions
   expand and relative temperatures as low as -50 K exist. Average
   temperature gradients between cold-and bulk-gases are up to 30 K/mm and
   gradients persist but drop in magnitude throughout compression as
   cold-and bulk-gases mix. Temperature stratification is greatest as the
   fuel disperses within the field-of-view producing large areas of
   cold-gases with relative temperatures as low as -50 K. Individual
   temperature images and 2D PDFs of identified cold-gas regions reveal
   that local regions of cold-gas imposed from evaporative cooling can last
   up to 30 CAD after fuel injection for the given operating conditions.
   The time-resolved imaging study show the mechanics of localized
   evaporative cooling and bulk-flow motion-driven mixing that over time
   reduces temperature gradients but does not completely homogenize the

   Compression Ignition combustion heat release rate}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{3117-3124}},
Abstract = {{Spark Assisted Compression Ignition (SACI) combustion is capable of
   partially decoupling combustion phasing from peak heat release rate,
   overcoming one of the major challenges associated with low temperature
   combustion. Experimental SACI studies have shown that for a given
   combustion phasing, peak heat release rate can be modulated by trading
   the fraction of the fresh charge consumed by flame propagation with the
   fraction consumed by auto-ignition. The chemical and physical mechanisms
   controlling the changes in heat release rate are not well known. The
   current work uses computational simulation to explore these modes
   through the combined control of spark timing and charge temperature via
   changes in negative valve overlap. Open cycle CFD simulation results are
   compared with experimental data to validate a newly developed SACI
   model, and used to gain insight into the processes governing combustion
   behavior. The simulations predict a 43\% reduction in the peak rate of
   heat release with increasing spark advance, while the unburned charge
   mass at the time of auto-ignition decreases by only 23\%. Detailed
   analysis of the end-gas thermodynamic state prior to auto-ignition shows
   as spark is advanced, the end-gas thermal and compositional
   distributions vary with the fraction of the charge consumed by the
   flame. The reduction in the rate of peak rate of heat release during the
   auto-ignition process is therefore a function of both the mass of the
   end-gas and the end-gas reactivity. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.

Title = {{Coupling of flame geometry and combustion instabilities based on
   kilohertz formaldehyde PLIF measurements}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{In the past, flame geometry was found to play an important role in
   determining when strong pressure fluctuations associated with a
   combustion instability occur in a gas turbine model combustor. The goals
   of this study were to use flame surface area as a more accurate way to
   quantify the flame shape and the heat release rate, in lieu of
   chemiluminescence; to accurately resolve both the spatial structure and
   the time history of the heat release fluctuations, and to show that
   kilohertz formaldehyde planar laser-induced fluorescence provides a new
   way to achieve these goals. The dual-swirl burner, developed at DLR
   Stuttgart by Meier et al. was operated using dimethyl ether (DME) to
   study fluctuations in the flame surface area, flame brush, flame length,
   and heat release rate. To understand the instability, accurate
   measurements are needed of the correlation between heat release rate
   fluctuations and pressure fluctuations. Thus heat release rate must be
   recorded as a function of time and space. However conventional
   chemiluminescence offers only a line-of-sight measurement. High-speed
   CH2O PLIF was applied to study the motion of flame surfaces in response
   to the pressure oscillations. Results show that the flame surface
   density fluctuated at the acoustic frequency (typically 320 Hz). The
   frequency of the combustion instability was found to increase as either
   the gas velocity or the flame speed was increased. These trends are
   consistent with previous n-tau theories that model the convective time
   delay. Strong pressure oscillations occur for conditions when the flame
   is nearly flat; the instability disappears when the flame becomes
   V-shaped. The explanation is that all points on a flatter flame have the
   same convective time delay but this is not true for the V-flame
   geometry. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{The direct simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC) has evolved over 50
   years into a powerful numerical technique for the computation of
   thermochemical nonequilibrium gas flows. In this context, nonequilibrium
   means that velocity and internal energy distribution functions are not
   in equilibrium forms due to a low number of intermolecular collisions
   within a fluid element. In hypersonic flow, nonequilibrium conditions
   occur at high altitude and in regions of flow fields with small length
   scales. This article highlights significant developments in particle
   simulation methods (since 2001) applied specifically to hypersonic
   flows, which now includes Molecular Dynamics in addition to DSMC.
   Experimental measurements that have led directly to improved DSMC models
   will be highlighted. Algorithm development for DSMC aimed at increasing
   computational efficiency is discussed with a focus on hybrid
   particle-continuum methods. New research that applies all-atom Molecular
   Dynamics simulation and trajectory-based DSMC simulation to normal shock
   waves is summarized. Finally, a discussion of state-resolved DSMC
   modeling is included with reference to future prospects for particle
   simulation methods and in particular for the DSMC method. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Mechanisms that cause foot discomfort during prolonged standing are
   poorly understood. There is currently no method for evaluating
   discomfort associated with low levels of static pressure that are
   typical during standing. Pain thresholds were measured for 20 healthy
   participants by applying five levels of static pressure at different
   plantar foot locations. A survival analysis was performed to determine
   the effects of pressure magnitude and foot location on the time until
   pain onset. Time to pain onset was significantly affected by pressure
   magnitude (P <0.001); time decreased as pressure increased. Foot
   location was also significant (P < 0.001); greatest times to pain onset
   (least sensitive) were observed under the heel and fifth metatarsal
   head, shortest times (most sensitive) were found under the midfoot. This
   research presents a novel methodology for evaluating static pressure
   that may be applicable to product design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The

Abstract = {{Conventional immunostaining methods consume large quantities of
   expensive antibodies and are limited in terms of the number of antigens
   that can be detected from a single sample. In order to achieve
   multiplexed immunostaining, we micropatterned antibodies using aqueous
   two-phase systems (ATPS) formed from polyethylene glycol (PEG) and
   dextran. Multiple antigens can be detected on a single fixed sample by
   incorporating antibodies within dextran solutions, which are then
   patterned by micropipetting at specific sites on the sample in a
   solution of PEG. The antibodies are retained within the dextran phase
   due to biomolecular partitioning, allowing multiple protein markers to
   be visualized simultaneously by way of chromogenic, chemiluminescent, or
   immunofluorescent detection. This aqueous two-phase system-mediated
   antibody micropatterning approach allows antibody dilutions to be easily
   optimized, reduces the consumption of expensive primary antibodies and
   can prevent antibody cross-reactions, since the antibodies are retained
   at separate sites within the dextran microdroplets.}},

Abstract = {{IEEE802.15.4 standard has quickly become a benchmark in the era of
   Internet of things. The mandatory mode of 2.4 GHz physical layer of
   IEEE802.15.4 standard employs offset quadrature phase shift keying
   (OQPSK) modulation with direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). The
   performance of conventional differential demodulator is not
   satisfactory. The coherent demodulator is vulnerable to initial phase
   mismatch or frequency offset. In this paper, we propose a new
   non-coherent demodulator for the OQPSK-DSSS system. The proposed
   demodulator is robust against initial phase mismatch and frequency
   offset. At 1.3 dB SNR in additive white Gaussian noise channel, the
   proposed demodulator achieves the target sensitivity at 1 \% packet
   error rate. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and
   robustness of the proposed demodulator.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB),
   induces formation of granulomas, structures in which immune cells and
   bacteria colocalize. Macrophages are among the most abundant cell types
   in granulomas and have been shown to serve as both critical bactericidal
   cells and targets for M. tuberculosis infection and proliferation
   throughout the course of infection. Very little is known about how these
   processes are regulated, what controls macrophage
   microenvironment-specific polarization and plasticity, or why some
   granulomas control bacteria and others permit bacterial dissemination.
   We take a computational-biology approach to investigate mechanisms that
   drive macrophage polarization, function, and bacterial control in
   granulomas. We define a ``macrophage polarization ratio{''} as a metric
   to understand how cytokine signaling translates into polarization of
   single macrophages in a granuloma, which in turn modulates cellular
   functions, including antimicrobial activity and cytokine production.
   Ultimately, we extend this macrophage ratio to the tissue scale and
   define a ``granuloma polarization ratio{''} describing mean polarization
   measures for entire granulomas. Here we coupled experimental data from
   nonhuman primate TB granulomas to our computational model, and we
   predict two novel and testable hypotheses regarding macrophage profiles
   in TB outcomes. First, the temporal dynamics of granuloma polarization
   ratios are predictive of granuloma outcome. Second, stable necrotic
   granulomas with low CFU counts and limited inflammation are
   characterized by short NF-kappa B signal activation intervals. These
   results suggest that the dynamics of NF-kappa B signaling is a viable
   therapeutic target to promote M-1 polarization early during infection
   and to improve outcome.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Work-hour restrictions have decreased flexibility in
   scheduling and reduced exposure to certain operative cases. These
   restrictions may affect a resident's ability to meet certification
   requirements, particularly for rare, unscheduled cases (e.g.,
   cardiothoracic transplants). We developed a computer-based simulation
   model using variables such as case volume and program size to
   demonstrate the influence of these factors on the likelihood of
   certifying a set of residents on rare cases.
   METHODS: We built a simulator to predict the probability of attaining
   certification for surgical residents, using cardiothoracic transplants
   as a test case. Inputs to the model included operating times, call
   schedules, and procurement travel times, as well as information on the
   distribution of times between transplants.
   RESULTS: We simulated 100 years of schedules using our current system
   parameters of an average of 33 heart and 31 lung transplants per year,
   and assuming an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
   Education-compliant dailyrotating call schedule. Despite having enough
   transplants to certify all residents for lungs if all opportunities were
   distributed equally among residents, the certification rate achieved
   when constrained by arrival time (and call schedules) and work
   restrictions was only 55\%. Our calculations show that meeting minimum
   transplant-certification requirements for all residents would require at
   least 1.5 times the expected number of annual transplants.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our model enables analysis of a given program's ability to
   certify its residents based on program size and volume. These results
   could be used to design alternative scheduling paradigms to improve
   certification rates, without requiring reductions in certification
   requirements or program size. (C) 2014 Association of Program Directors

Title = {{Thermodynamic insights into the self-assembly of capped nanoparticles
   using molecular dynamic simulations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{3820-3831}},
Abstract = {{Although the molecular modeling of self-assembling processes stands as a
   challenging research issue, there have been a number of breakthroughs in
   recent years. This report describes the use of large-scale molecular
   dynamics simulations with coarse grained models to study the spontaneous
   self-assembling of capped nanoparticles in chloroform suspension. A
   model system comprising 125 nanoparticles in chloroform evolved
   spontaneously from a regular array of independent nanoparticles to a
   single thread-like, ramified superstructure spanning the whole
   simulation box. The aggregation process proceeded by means of two
   complementary mechanisms, the first characterized by reactive collisions
   between monomers and oligomers, which were permanently trapped into the
   growing superstructure, and the second a slow structural reorganization
   of the nanoparticle packing. Altogether, these aggregation processes
   were over after ca. 0.6 mu s and the system remained structurally and
   energetically stable until 1 mu s. The thread-like structure closely
   resembles the TEM images of capped ZrO2, but a better comparison with
   experimental results was obtained by the deposition of the suspension
   over a graphene solid substrate, followed by the complete solvent
   evaporation. The agreement between the main structural features from
   this simulation and those from the TEM experiment was excellent and
   validated the model system. In order to shed further light on the
   origins of the stable aggregation of the nanoparticles, the Gibbs energy
   of aggregation was computed, along with its enthalpy and entropy
   contributions, both in chloroform and in a vacuum. The thermodynamic
   parameters arising from the modeling are consistent with larger
   nanoparticles in chloroform due to the solvent-swelled organic layer and
   the overall effect of the solvent was the partial destabilization of the
   aggregated state as compared to the vacuum system. The modeling strategy
   has been proved effective and reliable to describe the self-assembling
   of capped nanoparticles, but we must acknowledge the fact that larger
   model systems and longer timescales will be necessary in future
   investigations in order to assess structural and dynamical information
   approaching the behavior of macroscopic systems.}},

Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{651-662}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary genetic optimization algorithms (GA) have been used for
   thermal building optimization in the past. However, the results of these
   algorithms can differ significantly from each other because of random
   search and it is not guaranteed that the optimal solution is close to
   the global optimum. Furthermore, the use of these algorithms for
   non-expert users is limited. In this study, a hybrid single objective
   building optimization algorithm is introduced, which combines an
   evolutionary genetic algorithm with a modified simulated annealing
   algorithm.
   The goal of this paper is (1) to illustrate that the GA does not always
   provide solutions close to the global optimum and (2) to provide a
   building optimization method, which provides a higher reliability than
   what the GA alone can provide by using a relatively short computation
   time.
   Results: illustrate that the hybrid GA coupled with the modified SA
   provides solutions close to the global optimum in all of the test runs
   in this study. The proposed algorithm therefore provides more reliable
   results than the GA without the addition of the modified SA. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The erosion of boron particles from Hall thruster channel walls is a
   concern because it limits the lifetime of the device. A new optical
   experimental technique that measures path-integrated boron number
   density in the plume of a Hall effect thruster has recently been tested
   on an SPT-70 thruster. The data obtained may be used to infer the
   channel wall erosion rate, but further knowledge of the flow field is
   required. This development and the need to obtain a complete picture of
   the thruster channel and plume flows prompted a numerical simulation of
   the thruster erosion process. The direct simulation Monte Carlo method
   is used to study the sputtered boron atoms. These particles are
   introduced to the computational domain with velocities consistent with
   the sputtering process. The number flux is derived from a
   Sigmund-Thompson velocity distribution function. The number density
   values obtained in the plume are processed and compared with the
   measured values. The experimental and simulation results agree
   qualitatively, and disagree quantitatively by a factor of three to four,
   with the experimental results having lower values. Various causes of the
   discrepancy are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Spokes are azimuthally propagating perturbations in the plasma discharge
   of Hall effect thrusters (HETs) that travel in the E x B direction. The
   mechanisms for spoke formation are unknown, but their presence has been
   associated with improved thruster performance in some thrusters
   motivating a detailed investigation. The propagation of azimuthal spokes
   are investigated in a 6 kW HET by using high-speed imaging and
   azimuthally spaced probes. The spoke velocity is determined from
   high-speed image analysis using three methods with similar results. The
   spoke velocity for three discharge voltages (300, 400, and 450 V) and
   three anode mass flow rates (14.7, 19.5, and 25.2 mg/s) are between 1500
   and 2200 m/s across a range of magnetic field settings. The spoke
   velocity is inversely dependent on magnetic field strength for lower
   B-fields and asymptotes at higher B-fields. Spoke velocities calculated
   from the probes are consistently higher by 30\% or more. An empirically
   approximated dispersion relation of omega(alpha) =
   nu(alpha)(ch)k(theta)(alpha) - omega(alpha)(ch) where alpha >= 1 yields
   a characteristic velocity that matches the ion acoustic speed for
   similar to 5 eV electrons which exist in the near-anode and near-field
   plume regions of the discharge.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the physics involved in plasma detachment from magnetic
   nozzles is well theorized, but lacking in large scale experimental
   support. We have undertaken an experiment using the 150-m(3) variable
   specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket test facility and VX-200 thruster
   seeking evidence that detachment occurs and an understanding of the
   physical processes involved. It was found that the plasma jet in this
   experiment does indeed detach from the applied magnetic nozzle (peak
   field similar to 2 T) in a two part process. The first part involves the
   ions beginning to deviate from the nozzle field 0.8-m downstream of the
   nozzle throat. This separation location is consistent with a loss of
   adiabaticity where the ratio of the ion Larmor radius to the magnetic
   field scale length (r(Li)vertical bar del B vertical bar/B) becomes of
   order unity and conservation of the magnetic moment breaks down.
   Downstream of this separation region, the dynamics of the unmagnetized
   ions and magnetized electrons, along with the ion momentum, affect the
   plume trajectory. The second part of the process involves the formation
   of plasma turbulence in the form of high-frequency electric fields. The
   ion and electron responses to these electric fields depend upon ion
   momentum, magnetic field line curvature, magnetic field strength, angle
   between the particle trajectories, and the effective momentum transfer
   time. In stronger magnetic field regions of the nozzle, the detached ion
   trajectories are affected such that the unmagnetized ions begin to flare
   radially outward. Further downstream as the magnetic field weakens, for
   higher ion momentum and along the edge of the plume, the fluctuating
   electric field enables anomalous cross-field electron transport to
   become more dominant. This cross-field transport occurs until the
   electric fields dissipate similar to 2-m downstream of the nozzle throat
   and the ion trajectories become ballistic. This transition to ballistic
   flow correlates well with the sub-to-super Alfvenic flow transition
   (beta(k)). There was no significant change observed to the applied
   magnetic field.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been great interest in 3-D ultrasound imaging, but
   power constraints have precluded practical implementation of
   high-resolution and high-frame-rate 3-D ultrasound in handheld imaging
   platforms. In this paper, we propose a separable beamforming procedure
   for both 3-D synthetic aperture and plane wave systems that drastically
   reduces computational and hence power requirements. Separable
   beamforming approximates 2-D array beamforming for 3-D images through a
   series of beamforming operations on 1-D arrays. Our proposed method is
   based on a separable delay decomposition method that minimizes phase
   error. We show that the proposed separable synthetic aperture system
   achieves 19-fold complexity reduction and the proposed plane wave
   separable system achieves 12-fold complexity reduction compared to the
   corresponding non-separable beamforming baseline systems. Furthermore,
   we verify the performance of the fixed-point-precision separable
   beamforming and iterative delay calculation through Field II
   simulations. Our results show that both the synthetic aperture system
   and the plane wave system can produce images with the same quality as
   images generated by non-separable beamforming. We also briefly describe
   how the two types of separable beamformer can be implemented on a
   modified version of Sonic Millip3De, our recently proposed hardware
   accelerator for the digital front-end of a 3-D ultrasound system.}},

Abstract = {{A set of 920 heavily used LiF:Mg,Ti thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs)
   was placed into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) plate attached to a 40
   x 40 x 15 cm(3) PMMA phantom and irradiated to 4.52 mGy using a Cs-137
   source. This was repeated three times to determine the mean and standard
   deviation of each TLD's sensitivity. Reader drift was tracked over time
   with 10 control dosimeters. Two test sets of 100 TLDs were divided into
   subsets with sensitivities within +/- 1\% of their subset means. All
   dosimeters were re-irradiated four times to test the TLDs' response
   repeatability and determine the sensitivity uniformity within the
   subsets. Coefficients of variation revealed that, within a given subset,
   the dosimeters responded within +/- 2.5\% of their subset mean in all
   calibrations. The coefficient of variation in any of the 200 TLDs'
   calibrations was below 6\% across the four calibrations. The work
   validates the approach of performing three calibrations to separate
   heavily used and aged TLDs with overall sensitivity variations of +/-
   25\% into subsets that reproducibly respond within +/- 2.5\%. (C) 2014

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-49}},

Abstract = {{The lack of clear visibility and spatial awareness frequently results in
   construction accidents such as workers being struck by heavy equipment;
   and collisions between equipment and workers or between two pieces of
   equipment. In addition, certain processes such as excavation and
   drilling inherently pose constraints on equipment operators' abilities
   to clearly perceive and analyze their working environment. In this
   paper, the authors investigate the types of spatial interactions on
   construction sites and the need for graphical real-time monitoring. A
   computing framework is presented for monitoring interactions between
   mobile construction equipment and static job-site entities, workers, and
   other equipment. The framework is based on the use of sensor-based
   tracking, georeferenced models, and a resulting concurrent, evolving 3D
   graphical database. The developed framework enables a real-time 3D
   visualization scheme that provides equipment operators with graphical
   job-site views that are not possible through conventional on-site
   cameras. The two key parameters affecting a proximity monitoring
   framework's effectiveness are measurement error and latency. Measurement
   error refers to the error in proximity computation-with respect to
   ground truth or theoretically expected values. Latency is a difference
   in the time between when an event occurs in the real world and when a
   proximity monitoring framework provides output to warning systems that
   end users depend upon. Results from validation experiments conducted to
   analyze the achievable measurement error and latency of the monitoring
   framework using indoor GPS tracking as a ground truth system are also
   presented and discussed.}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to model defect
   creation in alpha zirconium with tensile strains comparable to the
   elastic strains near the interfaces between zirconium and hydrides.
   Irradiation-induced vacancy clusters under the strain field could be
   initiation sites for dislocation nucleation, and the gliding of these
   dislocations provides channels for transporting atoms from the cascade
   core, significantly accelerating the growth of vacancy clusters to form
   a void. The critical number of vacancies in a cluster that is enhanced
   to grow by the external stress is estimated. The present results provide
   an atomic-level mechanism to explain the stress-enhanced void growth
   under irradiation in zirconium, as observed in experiments. The
   acceleration of delayed hydride cracking under irradiation might be
   partially attributed to the formation of these voids. (C) 2014 Acta

Abstract = {{The accumulation and clustering of He atoms at Sigma 3 < 110 >\{112) and
   Sigma 73b < 110 > \{661\} grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centred cubic
   Fe, as well as their effects on GB reconstruction, have been
   investigated using atomic-level computer simulations. The accumulation
   of He atoms and the evolution of the GB structure all depend on local He
   concentration, temperature and the original GB structure. At a local He
   concentration of 1\%, small He clusters are formed in the Sigma 3 GB,
   accompanied by the emission of single self-interstitial Fe atoms (SIAs).
   At a He concentration of 5\%, a large number of SIAs are emitted from He
   clusters in the Sigma 3 GB and collect at the periphery of these
   clusters. The SIAs eventually form < 100 > dislocation loops between two
   He clusters. It is likely that impurities may promote the formation of <
   100 > loops and enhance their stabilities in alpha-Fe. At a He
   concentration of 10\%, the large number of emitted SIAs are able to
   rearrange themselves, forming a new GB plane within the Sigma 3 GB,
   which results in self-healing of the GB and leads to GB migration. In
   contrast to the Sigma 3 GB, He clusters are mainly formed along the GB
   dislocation lines in the Sigma 73b, and the emitted SIAs accumulate at
   the cores of the GB dislocations, leading to the climb of the
   dislocations within the GB plane. As compared to bulk Fe, a higher
   number density of clusters form at GBs, but the average cluster size is
   smaller. The product of cluster density and average cluster size is
   roughly constant at a given He level, and is about the same in bulk and
   GB regions, and varies linearly with the He concentration. (C) 2014 Acta

Abstract = {{Statistical X-ray computed tomography (CT) reconstruction can improve
   image quality from reduced dose scans, but requires very long
   computation time. Ordered subsets (OS) methods have been widely used for
   research in X-ray CT statistical image reconstruction (and are used in
   clinical PET and SPECT reconstruction). In particular, OS methods based
   on separable quadratic surrogates (OS-SQS) are massively parallelizable
   and are well suited tomodern computing architectures, but the number of
   iterations required for convergence should be reduced for better
   practical use. This paper introduces OS-SQS-momentum algorithms that
   combine Nesterov's momentum techniques with OS-SQS methods, greatly
   improving convergence speed in early iterations. If the number of
   subsets is too large, the OS-SQS-momentum methods can be unstable, so we
   propose diminishing step sizes that stabilize the method while
   preserving the very fast convergence behavior. Experiments with
   simulated and real 3D CT scan data illustrate the performance of the
   proposed algorithms.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{38-50}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent work by the authors investigated an extension of the finite
   element analysis of plasticity-induced crack closure to non-stationary,
   ship structural loading sequences by taking advantage of their inherent
   time-dependent nature in which the larger loading cycles tend to be
   clustered together. In doing so, first-order load interactions are
   presumed to arise from the random occurrence and severity of physical
   storms encountered by ships and offshore structures throughout their
   service lives. This material hysteresis is captured through a
   time-dependent crack ``opening{''} level (K-op) which is based on the
   evolution of a rate-independent, incremental plasticity model simulating
   combined nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening. The result is a
   mechanistic rather than phenomenological numerical model requiring only
   experimentally measured fatigue crack growth rates under constant
   amplitude, cyclic loading (e.g., ASTM E647-13) and a full material
   constitutive model defined through experimental push-pull tests for the
   same material. This approach permits a consideration of material
   behaviors which are physically relevant to structural steels, yet
   necessarily omitted in the similar application of a strip-yield model.
   The present paper generalizes the model originally proposed by the
   authors to now consider arbitrary storm model loading sequences taken
   from high-fidelity, time-domain seakeeping codes. To predict the fatigue
   fracture induced by variable amplitude stress records with upwards of 5
   x 10(6) time-dependent cycles, a consistent modeling reduction is
   applied based on the Ordered Overall Range (OOR) or racetrack counting
   method. The resultant crack growth behavior is demonstrated to converge
   remarkably well for sufficiently small refined mesh sizes. Using this
   model, and by considering different arrangements of the same stress
   record, the importance of nonlinearities (i.e., those associated with
   ship response as well as material hysteresis) are emphasized. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In situ ultrasonic fatigue with a cyclic frequency of 20 kHz was
   employed in an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) to
   characterize fatigue crack formation and growth in the near alpha
   titanium alloy Ti-6242S. The role of environment on small fatigue crack
   initiation and growth was investigated in vacuum and in variable
   pressures of saturated water vapor, as well as in laboratory air. Small
   crack growth behavior from cracks initiated at FIB-produced
   micro-notches indicated a significant environmental dependence, with
   fatigue crack growth rates increasing with increasing partial pressures
   of water vapor. Environment also influenced crack initiation lifetime in
   that cracks initiated earlier in laboratory air than in vacuum or
   saturated water vapor environments. Transgranular, crystallographic
   crack growth was observed in each environment, with the crack path in
   primary alpha grains producing facets parallel to basal planes when
   crack size was small. Small crack growth resistance had a marked
   sensitivity to microstructural features, such as alpha/alpha grain
   boundaries with high misorientation and alpha/alpha + beta boundaries.
   These initial investigations demonstrate the usefulness of in situ
   ultrasonic fatigue instrumentation (UF-SEM) as a new tool for the

Abstract = {{In a simplified setting, a multi-network model for remodeling in the

   in an algebraic relation for LV pressure-volume-contraction. We
   considered two networks, the original tissue and a new tissue, each of
   which has its own volume fraction, stress-free reference configuration,
   elastic properties, and contractility. This is used to explore the
   consequences of microstructural changes in the muscle tissue on LV
   function in terms of the pressure-volume loop during a single cardiac
   cycle. Special attention is paid to the stroke volume, which is directly
   related to cardiac output, and changes in LV wall stress caused by
   various disease states, including wall thinning (dilated
   cardiomyopathy), wall thickening (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy),
   contractility degradation, and stiffness changes (scarring). Various

Abstract = {{Knee articular cartilage exhibits complex mechanical behavior, even
   under high strain rates, which poses a challenge to developing accurate
   and efficient cartilage models. In particular, the tissue's
   stress-strain response is non-linear and the stiffness of the response
   is location-dependent. Hyperelastic models such as those of Alan Gent
   and others have increasingly found use in soft tissue biomechanics.
   Recently, a hyperelastic statistical chain network model representing
   the transverse isotropy of the collagen matrix in the superficial
   tangential zone has been developed. The model successfully simulated the
   100\% strain/s unconfined compression response of human proximal tibial
   cartilage. Moreover, spatial variations in the tangent modulus to the
   nominal stress-strain curve taken at 10\% strain were reflected in the
   variability of a single parameter of the model. Given the success of the
   model, we desired to determine whether these outcomes are equally
   applicable to healthy human distal femoral cartilage so that a complete
   model of tibiofemoral joint cartilage can be developed. The transversely
   isotropic model was employed along with two other hyperelastic chain
   network models to determine which model best simulated unconfined
   compression data for healthy distal femoral cartilage. The transversely
   isotropic model fit the data excellently (R-2=0.999). The model was
   subsequently simplified to depend on a single parameter and reapplied to
   the dataset The modified model maintained an excellent fit to the data
   (R-2=0.999), and its single parameter varied in a statistically similar
   regional pattern (p <0.05) to the experimentally-obtained elastic
   modulus of the tissue. Outcomes suggest that this model is suitable for
   modeling the spatially-varying, non-linear mechanics of healthy human
   distal femoral cartilage. Implementation of this constitutive relation
   within computational models of the knee will provide novel insight into
   the relationship between joint mechanics, cartilage loading, and knee
   osteoarthritis development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on the design of heparin and heparin-mimicking polymer based
   hydrogels are of tremendous interest and are fuelled by diverse emerging
   biomedical applications, such as antithrombogenic materials, growth
   factor carriers, and scaffolds for tissue engineering and regeneration
   medicine. In this study, inspired by the recent developments of
   heparin-based hydrogels, graphene oxide (GO) based heparin-mimicking
   hydrogels with hemocompatibility and versatile properties were prepared
   via free radical copolymerization, and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl
   ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)
   hydrogels were used as the control samples. The GO based
   heparin-mimicking polymeric hydrogels exhibited interconnected
   structures with thin pore walls and high porosity. Because of the
   increased ionization and electrostatic repulsion of sodium styrene
   sulfonate (SSNa) segments, the swelling ratios of the SSNa added
   hydrogels were dramatically increased; after incorporating flexible GO
   nanosheets, as the 3D skeleton of the hydrogels, the swelling ability
   was further increased. In addition, the GO based heparin-mimicking
   hydrogels showed superior red blood cell compatibility, anti-platelet
   adhesion ability and anticoagulant ability. Furthermore, drug release
   data indicated that the GO based heparin-mimicking hydrogels had high
   drug loading ability and prolonged drug releasing ability; the
   antibacterial tests showed coincident results with large inhibition
   zones and long effective periods. Due to the integration of blood
   compatibility, drug loading and releasing abilities, as well as an
   excellent ability for the removal of toxic molecules, the GO based
   heparin-mimicking hydrogels can be used for versatile biomedical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{This review provides a summary statement of recommended implementations
   of arterial spin labeling (ASL) for clinical applications. It is a
   consensus of the ISMRM Perfusion Study Group and the European ASL in
   Dementia consortium, both of whom met to reach this consensus in October
   2012 in Amsterdam. Although ASL continues to undergo rapid technical
   development, we believe that current ASL methods are robust and ready to
   provide useful clinical information, and that a consensus statement on
   recommended implementations will help the clinical community to adopt a
   standardized approach. In this review, we describe the major
   considerations and trade-offs in implementing an ASL protocol and
   provide specific recommendations for a standard approach. Our conclusion
   is that as an optimal default implementation, we recommend
   pseudo-continuous labeling, background suppression, a segmented
   three-dimensional readout without vascular crushing gradients, and
   calculation and presentation of both label/control difference images and
   cerebral blood flow in absolute units using a simplified model. Magn

Pages = {{204-213}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{PurposeTo develop MRI feedback for cavitation-based, focused ultrasound,
   tissue erosion surgery (histotripsy), we investigate image contrast
   generated by transient cavitation events.
   MethodsChanges in GRE image intensity are observed while balanced pairs
   of field gradients are varied in the presence of an acoustically driven
   cavitation event. The amplitude of the acoustic pulse and the timing
   between a cavitation event and the start of these gradient waveforms are
   also varied. The magnitudes and phases of the cavitation site are
   compared with those of control images. An echo-planar sequence is used
   to evaluate histotripsy lesions in ex vivo tissue.
   ResultsCavitation events in water cause localized attenuation when
   acoustic pulses exceed a pressure threshold. Attenuation increases with
   increasing gradient amplitude and gradient lobe separation times and is
   isotropic with gradient direction. This attenuation also depends upon
   the relative timing between the cavitation event and the start of the
   balanced gradients. These factors can be used to control the appearance
   of attenuation while imaging ex vivo tissue.
   ConclusionBy controlling the timing between cavitation events and the
   imaging gradients, MR images can be made alternately sensitive or
   insensitive to cavitation. During therapy, these images can be used to
   isolate contrast generated by cavitation. Magn Reson Med 73:204-213,

   Setting Multidisciplinary effort encompassing 2 academic institutions.
   Subjects and Methods Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine
   (DICOM) computed tomography scans were segmented and utilized in
   image-based CAD to create porous, anatomic structures. Bioresorbable
   polycaprolactone scaffolds with spherical and random porous architecture
   were produced using a laser-based 3D printing process. Subcutaneous in
   vivo implantation of auricular and nasal scaffolds was performed in a
   porcine model. Auricular scaffolds were seeded with chondrogenic growth
   factors in a hyaluronic acid/collagen hydrogel and cultured in vitro
   over 2 months' duration.
   Results Auricular and nasal constructs with several types of microporous
   architecture were rapidly manufactured with high fidelity to human
   patient anatomy. Subcutaneous in vivo implantation of auricular and
   nasal scaffolds resulted in an excellent appearance and complete soft
   tissue ingrowth. Histological analysis of in vitro scaffolds

Abstract = {{A computational framework for uncertainty quantification in transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (TMS) is presented. The framework leverages
   high-dimensional model representations (HDMRs), which approximate
   observables (i.e., quantities of interest such as electric (E) fields
   induced inside targeted cortical regions) via series of iteratively
   constructed component functions involving only the most significant
   random variables (i.e., parameters that characterize the uncertainty in
   a TMS setup such as the position and orientation of TMS coils, as well
   as the size, shape, and conductivity of the head tissue). The component
   functions of HDMR expansions are approximated via a multielement
   probabilistic collocation (ME-PC) method. While approximating each
   component function, a quasi-static finite-difference simulator is used
   to compute observables at integration/collocation points dictated by the
   ME-PC method. The proposed framework requires far fewer simulations than
   traditional Monte Carlo methods for providing highly accurate
   statistical information (e.g., the mean and standard deviation) about
   the observables. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework
   are demonstrated via its application to the statistical characterization
   of E-fields generated by TMS inside cortical regions of an MRI-derived
   realistic head model. Numerical results show that while uncertainties in
   tissue conductivities have negligible effects on TMS operation,
   variations in coil position/orientation and brain size significantly
   affect the induced E-fields. Our numerical results have several
   implications for the use of TMS during depression therapy: 1)
   uncertainty in the coil position and orientation may reduce the response
   rates of patients; 2) practitioners should favor targets on the crest of
   a gyrus to obtain maximal stimulation; and 3) an increasing
   scalp-to-cortex distance reduces the magnitude of E-fields on the
   surface and inside the cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Alloy 617 was exposed in Cr-Cr2O3 Rhines pack and in He-CO-CO2 gas with
   the goal of determining the mechanisms that govern the rapid internal
   aluminum oxidation kinetics of the alloy at 1123 K (850 A degrees C).
   The predominant mechanism is the accelerated oxygen transport along the
   incoherent Al2O3-metal interfaces in the internal oxidation zone of
   Alloy 617, which results in values of oxygen diffusion coefficients up
   to five orders of magnitude greater than the bulk oxygen diffusion
   coefficient in pure nickel at 1123 K (850 A degrees C). Another
   contribution to the rapid internal oxidation is the gas permeability of
   Cr2O3, which results in enhanced oxygen dissolution in the alloy.
   Despite formation of a surface Cr2O3 film, the dissolved oxygen
   concentration attained in Alloy 617 in He-CO-CO2 environments is a
   factor of 4 greater than that established by the dissociation oxygen
   partial pressure of Cr2O3 in the Rhines pack exposure. The dissolved
   oxygen concentrations and oxygen diffusion coefficient values
   established in this study are used to determine that internal oxidation
   of Alloy 617 in He-CO-CO2 environments can be mitigated by increasing
   the Al concentration of the alloy at least to 5.0 at. pct.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a simulation tool that accelerates the evaluation of design
   changes on the equilibrium cycle of fast-spectrum nuclear reactors.
   Within the tool, an implicit equilibrium cycle search is accelerated by
   a modal expansion perturbation method that expands arbitrary flux
   perturbations on a large basis of lambda-eigenmode harmonics. The
   harmonics are computed only at the reference state using Krylov subspace
   iterative methods, and substantial perturbations from this state are
   shown to be well approximated by computationally efficient algebraic
   expressions. The modal expansion method is coupled to the equilibrium
   method to produce the later-in-time response of each design
   perturbation, resulting in an explicit perturbation-accelerated
   equilibrium cycle method.
   Because the method determines the perturbed flux explicitly, a wide
   variety of core performance metrics may be tracked within optimization
   frameworks, including the performance of thermal hydraulics, fuel,
   economics, core mechanical, and transients. This capability strongly
   differentiates the method from traditional generalized perturbation
   theory approaches. The motivating end-use of the method is to evaluate
   objective functions in multidisciplinary optimization of advanced
   reactor designs, though many other applications are envisioned.}},

Abstract = {{The semiconductor supply chain is full of complexities outside of the
   traditional order, make/buy, and deliver process. One critical challenge
   occurs when part of a semiconductor fabricator's capacity is allocated
   to produce wafers designed by and provided to fabless companies. In this
   situation, linked customer requirements are expressed simultaneously at
   both the semiconductor level of the supply chain and the finished goods
   level. As a result of the complex contractual relationships between the
   foundry and the fabless company, a new solution model and method is
   needed to determine a production plan. In our approach, two linear
   programming (LP) models are solved sequentially where the results of a
   first LP are post-processed into input for a second LP. We describe the
   application of this approach for two different types of contracts where
   the goal is maintaining as much common modeling as possible while
   ensuring the unique features of each contract are covered. For one type
   of contract, the first LP model determines the minimum quantities of
   wafers required to be released into the fab to meet the contractual
   obligation; these required starts are added as a constraint for the
   second LP model. For the other type of contract, the first LP determines
   production at one level of the bills of materials and feeds these
   outputs into a second LP that determines production for later stages of
   manufacture. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{26-34}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Based on the modified couple stress theory, the free vibration behavior
   of micro scale Bernoulli Euler nanocomposite cantilever beams is
   analytically investigated by introducing a material length scale
   parameter. The mechanical properties of polymer composite micro-beams
   reinforced by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are assumed to vary
   continuously in the longitudinal direction of the beam. A new
   exponential distribution of the volume fraction of the constituents is
   proposed to achieve the beam's highest fundamental natural frequency
   given a weight percent (wt.\%) of MWCNTs. The effect of the material
   length scale parameter on the fundamental natural frequency of the
   ensuing axially functionally graded (FG) composite micro-beam is
   investigated for various CNT gradient indices. The difference between
   the frequencies, predicted by the modified couple stress theory and the
   classical continuum mechanics theory is considerable when the ratio of
   the beam thickness to the internal material length scale is
   approximately less than two. It is also observed that with a 1.0 wt.\%
   addition of MWCNTs to the polymer-based microcantilevers, almost a
   two-fold improvement in the relative change of the fundamental natural
   frequency is achieved by adopting the proposed optimum CNT dispersion
   pattern rather than the commonly used uniform CNT distribution pattern.

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{242-250}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that complete frictional contacts subjected to cyclic
   loads can shake down such that the interface becomes fully stuck after
   some number of cycles (even if partial-slip occurs at the onset of
   loading). However, if the amplitude of the cyclic load is greater than a
   particular value (the shakedown limit), it is impossible for shakedown
   to occur. In this paper, we examine a numerical approach for determining
   the shakedown limit for elastic frictional systems subjected to
   quasi-static loads using a discrete formulation. We then use this
   technique to determine the shakedown limit for a finite element model of
   a (coupled) complete contact with similar to 50,000 total degrees of
   freedom and similar to 250 along the contact interface. Finally, we
   compare the calculated value of the shakedown limit to a series of over
   1000 transient simulations and investigate the influence of initial
   conditions on steady state frictional energy dissipation. The results
   demonstrate that the dissipative properties of complete contacts can be
   highly dependent on the initial residual slip displacement state. (C)

Title = {{Context-Aware Framework for Highway Bridge Inspections}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Bridge inspections are tedious, time consuming, and complex tasks in the
   field that require highly specific information pertinent to the
   decisions at hand. The use of a centralized inspection database and
   bridge inspection reporting software has been explored by several state
   DOTs in recent years. During an inspection routine, the inspector
   visually assesses the condition of a particular bridge component. Based
   on a priori knowledge of the bridge components' taxonomic hierarchy and
   ontology, the inspector navigates to the form corresponding to the
   component. The inspector then reports the component's condition to the
   database. Context-aware computing offers the possibility to make
   inspections more efficient by reducing the time required to navigate the
   software and the effort spent by inspectors to learn, remember, and
   recall the taxonomic hierarchy and ontology of bridge components.
   Context-aware computing leverages environmental variables, which define
   the inspector's context, and delivers streamlined information, pertinent
   to the task at hand, to assist decision making. This paper presents a
   computing framework that identifies the component of interest to the
   inspector and automatically queries the inspection database to retrieve
   information relevant to the component being assessed. The framework's
   run-time and space complexity are analyzed and presented. The
   uncertainty in sensing the inspector's location and line of sight are
   translated into errors in identifying the component of interest. Using a
   case study bridge, sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate and
   characterize the errors in identifying the component of interest due to
   the errors in tracking technologies through simulation studies and field

Title = {{Methodology for Creating Empirically Supported Agent-Based Simulation
   with Survey Data for Studying Group Behavior of Construction Workers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Construction workers' attitudes and behaviors are one of the most
   important factors of a construction project's performance. As the
   attention paid to the impact of social influences and norms on worker
   behavior grows, agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) emerges as a
   research tool for studying workers' group behavior. With ABMS,
   researchers can uncover the underlying process of group behavior
   emerging from individuals' interactions in an organization. However,
   validating agent-based simulation with real data is the greatest
   challenge in using ABMS for organizational behavior research. With this
   background in mind, the objective of this paper is to propose a
   methodology for creating an empirically supported agent-based model for
   studying workers' behavior influenced by social norms. The proposed
   methodology suggests that empirical data collected by a questionnaire
   can be used for ABMS in three steps: (1) testing the agent behavior
   rules used in an agent-based model (i. e., testing the modeling
   assumptions), (2) demonstrating the model behavior's qualitative
   agreement with real workers' behavior (i. e., testing the simulation
   results against real data in a qualitative manner), and (3) creating a
   specific agent-based model with the model parameters that correspond to
   a specific empirical case. A specific agent-based model created in this
   way can then be seen as a scenario generator that corresponds to a
   specific reality and can be used to answer what if questions. Therefore,
   the model can be used to develop policies/interventions to improve
   workers' behavior in a given situation. The proposed methodology is
   illustrated by a study on construction workers' absenteeism that was
   conducted by the authors. This paper contributes to the body of
   knowledge of workforce management in construction; the proposed
   methodology provides a means of simulating workers' group behavior and
   developing policies/interventions to improve worker behavior at the
   group level in construction. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{While wireless sensor networks have been successfully deployed on a
   variety of civil infrastructure systems for structural monitoring, past
   studies have shown that there is room for improvement in terms of
   network robustness and overall resource consumption efficiency. The
   mechanisms employed by biological nervous systems (e.g. signal
   modulation, communication, and integration) can be used as inspiration
   for overcoming the performance bottlenecks seen in existing wireless
   sensor nodes and networks. The mammalian auditory system is of
   particular interest due to its unique signal decomposition techniques
   (performed by the cochlea) that enable real-time processing of complex
   sound signals. In this article, a novel wireless sensor architecture
   based on the operational principles of cochlea is described. The
   performance of the proposed sensor is validated on a
   single-degree-of-freedom structure that is excited by seismic ground
   motion signals, thus demonstrating its real-time monitoring capabilities
   while maintaining high data compression rates.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Micropipette aspiration measures the mechanical properties of single
   cells. A traditional micropipette aspiration system requires a bulky
   infrastructure and has a low throughput and limited potential for
   automation. We have developed a simple microfluidic device which is able
   to trap and apply pressure to single cells in designated aspiration
   arrays. By changing the volume flow rate using a syringe pump, we can
   accurately exert a pressure difference across the trapped cells for
   pipette aspiration. By examining cell deformation and protrusion length
   into the pipette under an optical microscope, several important cell
   mechanical properties, such as the cortical tension and the Young's
   modulus, can be measured quantitatively using automated image analysis.
   Using the microfluidic pipette array, the stiffness of breast cancer
   cells and healthy breast epithelial cells was measured and compared.
   Finally, we applied our device to examine the gating threshold of the
   mechanosensitive channel MscL expressed in mammalian cells. Together,
   the development of a microfluidic pipette array could enable rapid
   mechanophenotyping of individual cells and for mechanotransduction
   studies.}},

Pages = {{66-72}},

Abstract = {{The high optical and chemical activity of nanoparticles (NPs) signifies
   the possibility of converting the spin angular momenta of photons into
   structural changes in matter. Here, we demonstrate that illumination of
   dispersions of racemic CdTe NPs with right- (left-) handed circularly
   polarized light (CPL) induces the formation of right- (left-) handed
   twisted nanoribbons with an enantiomeric excess exceeding 30\%, which is
   similar to 10 times higher than that of typical CPL-induced reactions.
   Linearly polarized light or dark conditions led instead to straight
   nanoribbons. CPL `templating' of NP assemblies is based on the
   enantio-selective photoactivation of chiral NPs and clusters, followed
   by their photooxidation and self-assembly into nanoribbons with specific
   helicity as a result of chirality-sensitive interactions between the
   NPs. The ability of NPs to retain the polarization information of
   incident photons should open pathways for the synthesis of chiral
   photonic materials and allow a better understanding of the origins of
   biomolecular homochirality.}},

Abstract = {{Icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs) are a form of matter that is ordered
   but not periodic in any direction. All reported IQCs are intermetallic
   compounds and either of face-centred-icosahedral or
   primitive-icosahedral type, and the positions of their atoms have been
   resolved from diffraction data. However, unlike axially symmetric
   quasicrystals, IQCs have not been observed in non-atomic (that is,
   micellar or nanoparticle) systems, where real-space information would be
   directly available. Here, we show that an IQC can be assembled by means
   of molecular dynamics simulations from a one-component system of
   particles interacting via a tunable, isotropic pair potential extending
   only to the third-neighbour shell. The IQC is body-centred,
   self-assembles from a fluid phase, and in parameter space neighbours
   clathrates and other tetrahedrally bonded crystals. Our findings
   elucidate the structure and dynamics of the IQC, and suggest routes to
   search for it and design it in soft matter and nanoscale systems.}},

Abstract = {{Many natural micrometre-scale assemblies can be actuated to control
   their optical, transport and mechanical properties, yet such
   functionality is lacking in colloidal structures synthesized thus far.
   Here, we show with experiments and computer simulations that Janus
   ellipsoids can self-assemble into self-limiting one-dimensional fibres
   with shape-memory properties, and that the fibrillar assemblies can be
   actuated on application of an external alternating-current electric
   field. Actuation of the fibres occurs through a sliding mechanism that
   permits the rapid and reversible elongation and contraction of the
   Janus-ellipsoid chains by similar to 36\% and that on long timescales
   leads to the generation of long, uniform self-assembled fibres.
   Colloidal-scale actuation might be useful in microrobotics and in
   applications of shape-memory materials.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and proteins in living
   systems are a precursor to the formation of a NP-protein ``corona{''}
   that underlies cellular and organism responses to nanomaterials.
   However, the thermodynamic properties and reversibility of NP-protein
   interactions have rarely been examined. Using an automated,
   high-throughput and temperature-controlled dynamic light scattering
   (DLS) technique we observed a distinct hysteresis in the hydrodynamic
   radius of branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) coated-silver nanoparticles
   (bAgNPs) exposed to like-charged lysozyme during the processes of
   heating and cooling, in contrast to the irreversible interactions
   between bAgNPs and oppositely charged alpha lactalbumin (ALact). Our
   discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations offered a new molecular
   insight into the differential structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of
   bAgNPs binding with the two protein homologs and further revealed the
   different roles of the capping agents of citrate and BPEI in NP-protein
   interactions. This study facilitates our understanding of the
   transformation of nanomaterials in living systems, whose implications
   range from the field study of nanotoxicology to nanomaterials synthesis,
   nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{Passive fluidic particle manipulation techniques are useful for particle
   handling in microfluidic devices. Created using specifically designed
   channel structures, these systems are advantageous due to their low
   energy requirements and simple operation. Here we present results on a
   passive fluidic element termed an asymmetric trap, that is based on
   obstacle/particle steric interactions. The asymmetric behavior-capturing
   particles during downward flow with respect to the trap and releasing or
   passing particles during upward flow-is induced by the asymmetric
   configuration of the trap elements. The critical particle diameter for
   the asymmetric behavior in the trap array was theoretically obtained by
   numerically solving the conservation of flow equations through critical
   gaps between trap array elements. Based on the physical dimension of the
   array, five different trap/particle interaction regimes are predicted:
   symmetric passage (I), asymmetric passage (IIa), symmetric capturing
   (IIb), asymmetric capturing (III), and channel clogging (IV). The
   presence of these regimes was experimentally confirmed using
   micron-sized particles (20.3 mu m and 10.1 mu m) at low Reynolds number
   (Re < 0.1).}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{The conductivity of glass fiber reinforced polymers with nanocomposite
   matrices can be leveraged for structural health monitoring. Since
   nanocomposite matrices depend on well-connected networks of conductive
   nanofillers for electrical conductivity, matrix damage will sever the
   connection between fillers and result in a local conductivity loss.
   Monitoring composite conductivity changes can therefore give insight
   into the state of the matrix. Existing conductivity-based structural
   health monitoring methods are either insensitive to matrix damage or
   employ large electrode arrays. This research advances the state of the
   art by combining the superior imaging capabilities of electrical
   impedance tomography with conductive networks of nanofillers in the
   composite matrix. Electrical impedance tomography for damage detection
   in glass fiber/epoxy laminates with carbon black nanocomposite matrices
   is characterized by identifying a lower threshold of through-hole
   detection, demonstrating the capability of electrical impedance
   tomography to accurately resolve multiple through holes, and locating
   impact damage. It is found that through holes as small as 3.18 mm in
   diameter can be detected, and electrical impedance tomography can detect
   multiple through holes. However, sensitivity to new through holes is
   diminished in the presence of existing through holes unless a damaged
   baseline is used. Finally, it is shown that electrical impedance
   tomography is also able to accurately locate impact damage. These
   research findings demonstrate the considerable potential of
   conductivity-based health monitoring for glass fiber reinforced polymer
   laminates with conductive networks of nanoparticles in the matrix.}},

Abstract = {{The graphene has been interested world-widely for the superb mechanical
   and electrical properties. Among them, the thermal conductivity of
   graphene was often reported as the 500-5000 W/mK. We tried to apply the
   graphene to the thermal application of boiling heat transfer through the
   graphene coating. The graphene was used for the reduced graphene oxide
   flakes in water (RGO colloid). The RGO colloid boiling on
   silicon-dioxide heater (substrate) showed both the boiling heat transfer
   and the critical heat flux enhancement as 65\% and 70\%, respectively.
   After RGO colloid boiling, the base graphene layer (BGL) with 10-100 nm
   thickness below the self-assembled foam-like graphene (SFG) was
   observed. In order to confirm the effect of BGL on the enhanced boiling
   performance, the only water boiling on an artificial graphene
   multilayers (RGO film) coated heater was conducted, and shows the
   similar result with the RGO colloid boiling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Coupled bending and axial vibrations in a planar multi-story frame
   structure are controlled from a wave vibration standpoint, in which
   vibrations are described as waves that propagate along uniform
   waveguides, and are reflected and transmitted upon structural
   discontinuities. The bending vibrations are modeled using a Timoshenko
   model, which takes into account the effects of rotary inertia and shear
   distortion. The axial vibrations are modeled using elementary theory, as
   it is typically valid for frequencies up to twice the cutoff frequency
   of Timoshenko bending waves. Regardless of the complexity of a
   structure, when it is modeled from a wave point of view, it consists of
   only two basic types of structural components, namely, structural
   elements and joints. In this paper, both structural element and
   structural joint controllers are designed based on various control
   strategies such as optimal damping and optimal energy absorbing.
   Numerical examples are presented. Results are compared to those obtained
   based on the classical Euler-Bernoulli model that are available in the
   literature. As was expected, good agreement between the results of the
   models at low frequencies was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{An elastomeric cylindrical membrane with ends attached to rigid end caps
   is inflated and extended by a fluid that accesses its interior though
   one of the end caps. The membrane is at a high enough temperature that
   it undergoes microstructural changes due to simultaneous scission and
   re-crosslinking of macromolecular network junctions. Motivated by the
   known elastic response at lower temperatures, it is assumed that the
   membrane undergoes time-dependent extension and inflation. The
   deformation history is axially symmetric and nearly cylindrical for
   short times. There is then a time when a bulge-like deformation starts
   to form. This is treated as branching from the cylindrical deformation.
   For times beyond this branching time', the governing equations are
   satisfied by both the continuation of the initial deformation and the
   branched deformation. Criteria are derived for determining this
   branching time for two different assumptions about the branched
   response: when it is another cylindrical deformation and when it is a
   non-homogeneous bulge-shaped deformation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we apply retrospective-cost-based adaptive input and

   retrospective performance to drive the estimated maneuvering
   acceleration to approximate the actual maneuvering acceleration. Using
   the maneuvering target tracking model, a state estimator is constructed
   to provide the optimal estimate of the state. Numerical simulations
   illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of RCAISE with comparison

   The estimator structure is derived using an alternate attitude error

Abstract = {{Reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels, whose primary
   composition is iron and chromium, are considered as primary candidate
   structural materials for fusion demo and test reactor due to its
   technological maturity. There are a large numbers of defects, including
   dislocation loops, helium clusters, voids and interfaces, existing in
   RAFM steels irradiated under fusion environment, which were created by
   neutron transmutation and induced cascades. Grain boundaries (GBs) play
   an important role on evolution of these defects. Correspondingly,
   defects absorbed at GBs have detrimental effects on strength of grain
   boundary.
   In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) and molecular statics (MS)
   methods are applied to investigate the effects of defects on GB strength
   in bcc iron. Symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) with different tilt
   axes, GB planes and misorientations are considered. The results show
   that GB cleavage fracture strength is closely related to its structure
   and defect concentration. Also, it is of interest to note that the
   fracture strength of GBs and elongation of the crystals decrease with
   increasing defect size.}},

   of the input model is especially important, yet is often hard to obtain

   without any knowledge on the input tail, but rather only making a
   general assumption that it is convex. We focus on the standard problem
   of estimating the probability for i.i.d. sum, and set out goal as to
   compute its worst-case bound among all summand distributions that have
   convex tails. Our main procedure relies on a stochastic, and in a sense
   infinite-dimensional, version of the Frank-Wolfe method in nonlinear
   programming We demonstrate through a numerical example how the level of
   knowledge on the tail of the summands relates to the conservativeness in
   computing bounds for the aggregate tail quantity.}},

Abstract = {{Performance analysis via stochastic simulation is often subject to input
   model uncertainty, meaning that the input model is unknown and needs to
   be inferred from data. Motivated especially from situations with limited
   data, we consider a worst-case analysis to handle input uncertainty by
   representing the partially available input information as constraints
   and solving a worst-case optimization problem to obtain a conservative
   bound for the output. In the context of i.i.d. input processes, such
   approach involves simulation-based nonlinear optimizations with decision
   variables being probability distributions. We explore the use of a
   specialized class of minor descent stochastic approximation (MDSA) known
   as the entropic descent algorithm, particularly effective for handling
   probability simplex constraints, to iteratively solve for the local
   optima. We show how the mathematical program associated with each
   iteration of the MDSA algorithm can be efficiently computed, and carry
   out numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{We consider linear programs where some parameters in the objective
   functions are unknown but data are available. For a risk-averse modeler,
   the solutions of these linear programs should be picked in a way that
   can perform well for a range of likely scenarios inferred from the data.
   The conventional approach uses robust optimization. Taking the
   optimality gap as our loss criterion, we argue that this approach can be
   high-risk, in the sense that the optimality gap can be large with
   significant probability. We then propose two computationally tractable
   alternatives: The first uses bootstrap aggregation, or so-called bagging
   in the statistical learning literature, while the second uses Bayes
   estimator in the decision-theoretic framework. Both are simulation-based
   schemes that aim to improve the distributional behavior of the
   optimality gap by reducing its frequency of hitting large values.}},

   probability distribution is not fully known, and can only be observed
   through data. Common procedures handle such problems by optimizing an
   empirical counterpart, namely via using an empirical distribution of the
   input. The optimal solutions obtained through such procedures are hence
   subject to uncertainty of the data. In this paper, we explore techniques
   to quantify this uncertainty that have potentially good finite-sample
   performance. We consider three approaches: the empirical likelihood
   method, nonparametric Bayesian approach, and the bootstrap approach.
   They are designed to approximate the confidence intervals or posterior
   distributions of the optimal values or the optimality gaps. We present
   computational procedures for each of the approaches and discuss their
   relative benefits. A numerical example on conditional value-at-risk is

Abstract = {{Sands change their properties over time even under constant loads: they
   age. The changes include increase in small strain stiffness and the
   resistance to cone penetration. Mechanisms behind aging have been
   proposed in the past, but none has gained wide acceptance. Previous
   research did not produce sufficient information about the behavior of
   individual contacts between grains. A static fatigue hypothesis is
   adopted here, which attributes aging of sand to evolution of
   micromechanical properties at grain contacts, caused by delayed
   fracturing of textural features at grain surfaces. A distinct element
   model of a small portion of an inter-grain contact region was
   constructed; the solid material of the grain was modeled with an
   assembly of sub-particles bonded together with the parallel-bond stress
   corrosion model (PSC), which is able to mimic the stress corrosion
   process at the near-surface grain region. The surface at the contact was
   generated with a random topography to simulate the rough sand grain
   surface. Numerical static fatigue tests were conducted on this model,
   where normal load was applied by a rigid plate and was kept constant
   throughout the test. The true contact area was monitored in term of the
   number of contact points, as stress corrosion developed. The results
   provided useful information regarding evolution of grain contacts, which
   in turn, shed light on the mechanisms of sand aging.}},

Title = {{Electrode subset selection methods for an EEG-based P300 brain-computer
   interface}},
Journal = {{DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION-ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{216-220}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: An electroencephalography (EEG)-based P300 speller is a type of
   brain-computer interface (BCI) that uses EEG to allow a user to select
   characters without physical movement. In general, using fewer electrodes
   for such a system makes it easier to set up and less expensive. This
   study addresses the question of electrode selection for EEG-based P300
   systems. Methods: Data from 13 subjects collected with a 16-electrode
   cap was analyzed. The optimal subsets of electrodes of sizes 1-15 were
   calculated for each subject and for the group as a whole. The methods of
   exhaustive search, forward selection, and backward elimination were then
   compared to each other and to these optimal subsets. Results: The
   results show that, while none of the methods consistently picked the
   best-performing electrode subsets, all methods were able to find small
   electrode subsets that provided acceptable accuracy both for individuals
   and for the whole group. The computationally intensive exhaustive search
   method provided no statistically significant increase in performance
   over the much quicker forward and backward selection methods.
   Conclusions: The forward and backward selection methods are preferred
   for electrode selection.}},

Title = {{Organic databases}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{270-283}},
Abstract = {{Databases today are carefully engineered: there is an expensive and
   deliberate design process, after which a database schema is defined;
   during this design process, various possible instance examples and use
   cases are hypothesised and carefully analysed; finally, the schema is
   ready and then can be populated with data. All of this effort is a major
   barrier to database adoption. In this paper, we explore the possibility
   of organic database creation instead of the traditional engineered
   approach. The idea is to let the user start storing data in a database
   with a schema that is just enough to cove the instances at hand. We then
   support efficient schema evolution as new data instances arrive. By
   designing the database to evolve, we can sidestep the expensive
   front-end cost of carefully engineering the design of the database.
   Indeed, the deliberate design model complicates not only database
   creation, but also database transformation (i.e., schema mapping)
   because traditional schema mapping tasks are carefully engineered with
   declarative specification hidden beneath complex user interface. In this
   paper, we also study the issue of organic database transformation, which
   automatically induces schema mappings from sample target database
   instances.}},

   rodent model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THERAPEUTIC ULTRASOUND}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Myocardial cavitation-enabled therapy (MCET) has been
   proposed as a means to achieve minimally invasive myocardial reduction
   using ultrasound to produce scattered microlesions by cavitating
   contrast agent microbubbles.
   Methods: Rats were treated using burst mode focused ultrasound at 1.5
   MHz center frequency and varying envelope and pressure amplitudes. Evans
   blue staining indicated lethal cardiomyocytic injury. A previously
   developed quantitative scheme, evaluating the histologic treatment
   results, provides an insightful analysis for MCET treatment parameters.
   Such include ultrasound exposure amplitude and pulse modulation,
   contrast agent dose, and infusion rate.
   Results: The quantitative method overcomes the limitation of visual
   scoring and works for a large dynamic range of treatment impact.
   Macrolesions are generated as an accumulation of probability driven
   microlesion formations. Macrolesions grow radially with radii from 0.1
   to 1.6 mm as the ultrasound exposure amplitude (peak negative) increases
   from 2 to 4 MPa. To shorten treatment time, a swept beam was
   investigated and found to generate an acceptable macrolesion volume of
   about 40 mu L for a single beam position.
   Conclusions: Ultrasound parameters and administration of microbubbles
   directly influence lesion characteristics such as microlesion density
   and macrolesion dimension. For lesion generation planning, control of
   MCET is crucial, especially when targeting larger pre-clinical models.}},

Title = {{Resonant magnetoelastic microstructures for wireless actuation of liquid
   flow on 3D surfaces and use in glaucoma drainage implants}},
Journal = {{MICROSYSTEMS \& NANOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Magnetoelastic resonators made from metal alloy foils are widely used
   for miniature wireless anti-theft tags and have also been explored for
   use in various sensing applications. Through annealing within
   three-dimensional (3D) molds, these foils can be formed into curved
   structures. Consequently, magnetoelastic materials present an
   opportunity for the development of a new class of wireless, actuators
   that have small form factors and low surface profiles and that can
   conform to curved surfaces. This paper describes passive, wireless,
   resonant magnetoelastic actuators intended for the generation of fluid
   flow on the surfaces of implantable Ahmed glaucoma drainage devices. The
   actuators are remotely excited to resonance using a magnetic field
   generated by external coils. The fluid flow is intended to limit
   cellular adhesion to the surface of the implant, as this adhesion can
   ultimately lead to implant encapsulation and failure. The actuators are
   micromachined from planar 29-mu m-thick foils of Metglas 2826MB
   (Fe40Ni38Mo4B18), an amorphous magnetoelastic alloy, using photochemical
   machining. Measuring 10.3 x 5.6 mm(2), the planar structures are
   annealed in 3D molds to conform to the surface of the drainage device,
   which has an aspherical curvature. Six actuator designs are described,
   with varying shapes and resonant mode shapes. The resonant frequencies
   for the different designs vary from 520 Hz to 4.7 kHz. Flow velocities
   of up to 266 mu m s(-1) are recorded at a wireless activation range of
   25-30 mm, with peak actuator vibration amplitudes of 1.5 mu m.
   Integrated actuators such as those described here have the potential to
   greatly enhance the effectiveness of glaucoma drainage devices at
   lowering eye pressure and may also be useful in other areas of medicine.}},

Title = {{Effect of Bend Radius on Magnitude and Location of Erosion in S-Bend}},
Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Solid particle erosion is a mechanical process that removes material by
   the impact of solid particles entrained in the flow. Erosion is a
   leading cause of failure of oil and gas pipelines and fittings in fluid
   handling industries. Different approaches have been used to control or
   minimize damage caused by erosion in particulated gas-solid or
   liquid-solid flows. S-bend geometry is widely used in different fluid
   handling equipment that may be susceptible to erosion damage. The
   results of a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation of diluted
   gas-solid and liquid-solid flows in an S-bend are presented in this
   paper. In addition to particle impact velocity, the bend radius may have
   significant influence on the magnitude and the location of erosion. CFD
   analysis was performed at three different air velocities (15.24m/s-45.72
   m/s) and three different water velocities (0.1 m/s-10 m/s) with
   entrained solid particles. The particle sizes used in the analysis range
   between 50 and 300 microns. Maximum erosion was observed in water with
   10m/s, 250 micron particle size, and a ratio of 3.5. The location of
   maximum erosion was observed in water with 10m/s, 300-micron particle
   size, and a ratio of 3.5. Comparison of CFD results with available
   literature data showed reasonable and good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper focuses on the results obtained from impedance
   spectroscopy, thermal analysis (DSC and DMA) and electron paramagnetic
   resonance (EPR) of membranes of DNA plasticized with glycerol and
   containing either poly( ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) or Prussian
   Blue (PB) and copper perchlorate (CuClO4). The ionic conductivity values
   for the DNAPEDOT- CuClO4 and DNA-PB-CuClO4 of 4.8x10(-4)S/cm and
   2.2x10(-4)S/cm at 30(o)C, respectively, were obtained. The DSC analysis
   of the samples showed two glass transition temperatures at about -80 and
   50(o)C and DMA a permanent deformation above 50(o)C ascribed to a
   transition between elastic and plastic states. The EPR spectra evidenced
   that Cu2+ ions are in tetragonally distorted octahedral sites and the
   quantitative analysis of the EPR spin Hamiltonian g(||) and A(||)
   parameters revealed copper ions complexed by nitrogen and oxygen atoms.
   All these results suggest that DNA-biomembranes are interesting
   materials to be used in materials engineering science.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic arrays of discrete nonlinear oscillators may exhibit a
   phenomenon termed intrinsic localized modes (ILMs), in which areas of
   localized energy are triggered. This research hypothesizes that
   exploiting the unique localization of energy produced by ILMs in
   periodic structures may be strategically utilized to detect damage
   within the structures. To explore the idea, this paper presents an
   experimental study of the opportunities enabled by triggering and
   steering ILMs through a periodic structure composed of nonlinear,
   cantilevered beams which contain a stiffness defect representative of a
   damaged array site. The investigations show that the particular
   behaviors of ILMs moving within a damaged structure, as compared to
   within the healthy periodic system, may be used to identify the presence
   as well as the approximate location of the damage. Strategies to guide
   the ILM within the periodic structure are explored for their application
   to situations in which deliberate energy-steering is favorable. The
   findings show that ILMs is a robust phenomenon and their strategic
   employment presents novel opportunities to advance the aims of
   structural damage identification.}},

Abstract = {{Although graphics processing units (GPUs) are capable of high compute
   throughput, their memory systems need to supply the arithmetic pipelines
   with data at a sufficient rate to avoid stalls. For benchmarks that have
   divergent access patterns or cause the L1 cache to run out of resources,
   the link between the GPU's load/store unit and the L1 cache becomes a
   bottleneck in the memory system, leading to low utilization of compute
   resources. While current GPU memory systems are able to coalesce
   requests between threads in the same warp, we identify a form of spatial
   locality between threads in multiple warps. We use this locality, which
   is overlooked in current systems, to merge requests being sent to the L1
   cache. This relieves the bottleneck between the load/store unit and the
   cache, and provides an opportunity to prioritize requests to mini-mize
   cache thrashing. Our implementation, WarpPool ,yields a 38\% speedup on
   memory throughput-limited kernels by increasing the throughput to the L1
   by 8\% and the reducing the number of L1 misses by 23\%. We also
   demonstrate that WarpPool can improve GPU pro-grammability by achieving
   high performance without the need to optimize workloads' memory access
   patterns. A Verilog implementation including place-and-route shows
   WarpPool requires 1.0\% added GPU area and 0.8\% added power.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic steel moment frames rely on the formation of plastic hinges at
   the beam ends and at the column bases to dissipate seismic input energy.
   Local buckling and accumulation of damage associated with this inelastic
   behavior may lead to inconsistent performance, residual deformation, and
   significant repair needs. To take advantage of the properties of
   light-weight, non-traditional materials that offer high damping, the
   integration of these materials into the hollow portion of hollow
   structural section members is considered to enhance their performance
   under large cyclic loads associated with a seismic event. The use of
   these materials as fill in hollow structural sections is explored
   through beam bending tests under cyclic load. The bending tests allow
   the cyclic behavior to be assessed with respect to fill material type
   (polymer foam and rubber), fill length, member width-thickness ratio,
   and member depth-thickness ratio. The results are used to evaluate the
   ability of the fill materials to control the behavior of structures
   during a seismic event and will benefit design professionals, code
   writers, and researchers in developing new ways to better integrate
   non-traditional materials into structural systems.}},

Abstract = {{Performance-based design (PBD) is becoming the benchmark approach for
   designing civil structures that rationally meet society's need for a

   define an appropriate framework to allow the principles of PBD to be
   fully embraced during the design of building systems to resist severe
   wind events. Focus is placed on highlighting the necessary steps to
   reach such a goal, which include the definition of site-specific wind
   hazard models, of suitable fragility functions as well as of consequence
   functions that rationally assess damage and losses, while communicating
   performance in ways that are meaningful to decision-makers. The
   application of the framework to a case study provides the basis for a

Abstract = {{Spray-applied fire-resistive materials (SFRM) is one of the most widely
   used passive fire protection material for steel structures in North
   America. However, SFRM is inherently brittle and tends to dislodge or
   delaminate under extreme loading conditions (earthquakes or impacts) and
   even normal service load. Such loss of fire protection material puts the
   steel structure in great danger in subsequent fires. To address this
   concern, a new type of ductile spray-applied fire-resistive material,
   namely spray-applied fire-resistive engineered cementitious composite
   (SFR-ECC), has been developed recently as a durable alternative to
   conventional SFRM. SFR-ECC exhibits a ductile strain-hardening behavior
   with tensile strength, tensile ductility and interfacial adhesion (to
   steel) of 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional SFRM
   under static loads. In the present paper, the behavior of SFR-ECC under
   high rate loading was experimentally studied. SFR-ECC maintains desired
   tensile performance under high rate loading, ensuring the performance of
   such material under impact or earthquake loads. Low velocity impact
   tests were also conducted on SFR-ECC protected steel beam and panel.
   SFR-ECC protected steel system showed much higher impact resistance than
   conventional SFRM protected ones. The integrity and functionality of
   SFR-ECC were well preserved after multiple impacts while conventional
   SFRM experienced catastrophic failure. This experimental study further
   demonstrated the advantages of SFR-ECC over conventional SFRM under
   severe loading conditions, which is critical for the fire safety of
   steel structures under multi-hazards.}},

Abstract = {{Topology optimization has recently been explored as a tool for the
   conceptual design of efficient structures during the initial building
   design stage. Although these techniques were originally developed in a
   deterministic setting, most practical applications are subject to
   inherent uncertainties in the design problem (e.g. stochastic loads,
   model idealization) and thus there has recently been an effort to
   incorporate the effect of these uncertainties into the topology
   optimization procedure. Within this context, the authors have developed
   an approach that is able to efficiently account for the uncertainties in
   the problem at hand using concepts from Performance-Based Design. This
   paper presents a general overview of this method and illustrates its
   applicability for the topology design of structures under wind and

   system level, models undergoing different modes of deformation and
   failure are deployed in a virtual reality setting. The virtual reality
   environment developed allows users to interact with a structure through
   a head mounted device and hand system in a CAVE-like immersive
   environment or with a virtual reality headset such as the Oculus Rift.
   The use of a portable headset allows the virtual reality models to be
   directly accessible in the classroom. The models, which can be modified
   and expanded, enable students to view a wide variety of structures under
   different loadings from any number of vantage points unlike a physical
   model that may be limited by cost and safety concerns.}},

Abstract = {{Obstructions within a task environment provide opportunities for people

   Previous research has shown that bracing can increase one-hand isometric

   study examined the patterns of force on the bracing surfaces as a
   function of task and human characteristics. Twenty-two men and women
   exerted static forces with their right hands. Bracing opportunities were
   provided at the thigh, contralateral hand, or both. Using the task hand
   force as a reference, bracing forces were decomposed into opposing and
   non-opposing components and normalised relative to task hand force
   magnitude. Five distinct patterns of bracing force, termed
   force-generation strategies (FGSs), emerged.}},

Abstract = {{To exploit the favorable mechanical and electrical properties of
   graphene in practical applications, control over the dimensionality and
   geometry of assembled graphene structures is required. Here, we report
   the use of boiling with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) colloidal
   dispersion to form self-assembled three-dimensional (3D) RGO structures.
   The morphology of the resulting self-assembled RGO structures could be
   controlled by varying the heat flux during boiling. A large heat flux
   resulted in continuous bubble nucleation at the surface, and
   consequently, the interference exhibited aggregates of RGO flakes around
   the bubble nucleation site due to repetitive expansion and contraction
   of the bubble triple line. As the water evaporated, self-assembled
   foam-like graphene (SFG) was formed. As the heat flux increased, more
   vigorous agitation occurred at the interface, which led to smaller pores
   in the structures. With a low heat flux, the less vigorous bubble
   interference dynamics led to interactions between the RGO flakes, and
   consequently, self-assembled bump-like graphene (SBG) structures were
   formed, which were not porous. The self-assembled RGO 3D structures
   exhibited favorable mechanical and electrical properties compared with
   conventional 3D self-assembled graphene-or carbon-based structures. Such
   controllable 3D RGO structures with good mechanical and electrical
   properties have potential applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Systems With Prestress and Friction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{An efficient methodology to capture the nonlinear responses of combustor
   systems with prestress and Coulomb friction is developed. The combustor
   systems experience wear at the interfaces between components due to
   flow-induced vibrations. In particular, wear has been observed at the
   interface between the transition piece and the hula seal, and at the
   interface between the hula seal and the liner. These interfaces are
   prestressed, and their vibratory response has a softening nonlinearity
   caused by Coulomb friction combined with microslip. In addition, the
   contact between the hula seal and the transition piece is that between a
   convex surface and a concave surface. Hence, geometric nonlinearity of
   the contact stiffness in the normal direction is present also. These
   phenomena are hard to capture by full-order finite element (FE)
   approaches because they require time marching or harmonic balancing of
   very large models. To address this issue, we develop reduced order
   models (ROMs) which are specifically designed to capture Coulomb
   friction (combined with micro-and macroslip). To demonstrate the
   proposed approach, a simplified hula seal is placed between two very
   rigid plates (which relate to the transition piece and the liner). For
   validation, contact elements are used to model the interface between the
   plates and the hula seal. Transient dynamic analysis (TDA) in ANSYS is
   applied to the full-order model. The model is shown to exhibit softening
   nonlinearity and microslip at all levels of prestress. To show that ROMs
   for this system are possible (i.e., they exist), we use proper
   orthogonal decomposition (POD) to show that the dynamics is dominated by
   a low number of spatial coherences. For a variety of frequency ranges
   and prestress levels, we show that a single such coherence is dominant.
   Next, low order models are proposed and their parameters are identified.
   A systematic method to identify these parameters is developed.
   Particular attention is paid to the amount of calculations needed for
   obtaining these parameters. Finally, the ROMs are validated by comparing
   their predictions with results from TDA for the full-order model. We
   show that these ROMs can accurately predict the nonlinear response of
   the system.}},

Abstract = {{The excitation-induced stability (EIS) phenomenon in a harmonically
   excited bistable Duffing oscillator is studied in this paper. Criteria
   to predict system and excitation conditions necessary to maintain EIS
   are derived through a combination of the method of harmonic balance,
   perturbation theory, and stability theory for Mathieu's equation.
   Accuracy of the criteria is verified by analytical and numerical
   studies. We demonstrate that damping primarily determines the likelihood
   of attaining EIS response when several dynamics coexist while excitation
   level governs both the existence and frequency range of the EIS region,
   providing comprehensive guidance for realizing or avoiding EIS dynamics.
   Experimental results are in good agreement regarding the comprehensive

Abstract = {{In this paper, macro homogenized material models are adopted to simulate
   an in-plane constrained punch indentation test of a small-scale
   lithium-ion battery module specimen. The macro material models are based
   on the compressive stress strain curves obtained from representative
   volume element (RVE) module specimens under in-plane constrained
   compression tests. The ABAQUS implicit solver is used for simulation of
   the punch test. The hyperfoam and the crushable foam material models in
   ABAQUS are adopted to fit the nominal stress strain curves of the module
   RVE specimens under in-plane constrained compression. The load
   displacement responses and the deformation patterns of the module
   specimen from the finite element analyses of the punch test based on the
   hyperfoam and crushable foam material models compare fairly well with
   the experimental results. However, the initial yielding and the
   corresponding unloading of the load displacement curves of the module
   specimen due to micro buckling could not be modeled distinctively by the
   macro homogenized models. The computational results show that the
   material models available in commercial finite element software can be
   used to reasonably model lithium-ion battery modules under non-uniform

Abstract = {{Background: A persistent atrophy of muscle fibers and an accumulation of
   fat, collectively referred to as fatty degeneration, commonly occur in
   patients with chronic rotator cuff tears. The etiology of fatty
   degeneration and function of the residual rotator cuff musculature have
   not been well characterized in humans. We hypothesized that muscles from
   patients with chronic rotator cuff tears have reduced muscle fiber force
   production, disordered myofibrils, and an accumulation of fat vacuoles.
   Methods: The contractility of muscle fibers from biopsy specimens of
   supraspinatus muscles of 13 patients with chronic full-thickness
   posterosuperior rotator cuff tears was measured and compared with data
   from healthy vastus lateralis muscle fibers. Correlations between muscle
   fiber contractility, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores,
   and tear size were analyzed. Histology and electron microscopy were also
   performed.
   Results: Torn supraspinatus muscles had a 30\% reduction in maximum
   isometric force production and a 29\% reduction in normalized force
   compared with controls. Normalized supraspinatus fiber force positively
   correlated with ASES score and negatively correlated with tear size.
   Disordered sarcomeres were noted, along with an accumulation of
   lipid-laden macrophages in the extracellular matrix surrounding
   supraspinatus muscle fibers.
   Conclusions: Patients with chronic supraspinatus tears have significant
   reductions in muscle fiber force production. Force production also
   correlates with ASES scores and tear size. The structural and functional
   muscle dysfunction of the residual muscle fibers is independent of the
   additional area taken up by fibrotic tissue. This work may help
   establish future therapies to restore muscle function after the repair
   of chronically torn rotator cuff muscles. Level of evidence: Basic

Title = {{Low-temperature ignition behavior of iso-octane}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{79-86}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Auto-ignition properties of iso-octane mixtures were systematically
   investigated at conditions relevant to practical combustion devices
   using the University of Michigan Rapid Compression Facility and the
   Tsinghua University Rapid Compression Machine. Pressure time history
   measurements and high-speed imaging of the ignition process were used in
   both facilities to determine auto-ignition delay times and directly
   observe physical ignition behaviors. Test mixtures used fuel-to-O-2
   equivalence ratios of phi = 0.25 and 1.0, and were air-dilute, i.e.
   molar O-2 to diluent gas (N-2, Ar) ratio of 1: 3.76. The pressures and
   temperatures after compression ranged from 3 to 30 atm and 740-1125 K
   respectively. The comprehensive results of the present work combined
   with those from previous shocktube studies clearly illustrate the
   existence of both inhomogeneous and homogeneous auto-ignition behaviors
   at these conditions. Analysis of patterns in the ignition behaviors
   revealed a dependence on initial unburned temperature and pressure, as
   well as equivalence ratio, with distinct regions of thermodynamic state
   in which the behavior is consistent and repeatable. The strong ignition
   limits were identified for both phi using the experimental results and
   compared to predicted locations made using the Sankaran Criterion (the
   ratio of the laminar flame speed to the thermal gradient driven
   spontaneous propagation speed). Predictions made using an assumed
   thermal gradient of 5-10 K/mm were in excellent agreement with
   measurements at all conditions, clearly indicating that use of this
   criterion is an effective method for a priori prediction of
   auto-ignition behaviors for iso-octane. This validation of the Sankaran
   Criterion for iso-octane, an important reference hydrocarbon fuel,
   importantly broadens the use of this tool and is an indication that
   ignition processes in hydrocarbon and high hydrogen content fuels are
   fundamentally similar. Additionally, a comparison of the measured
   auto-ignition delay times to predictions made using zero-dimensional
   homogeneous reactor modeling revealed that for experiments with
   inhomogeneous ignition behaviors, agreement was dependent on phi and the
   auto-ignition delay time. The presence of inhomogeneous ignition
   behavior did not significantly affect the accuracy of auto-ignition
   delay time predictions for mixtures with phi = 0.25; whereas, for
   mixtures with phi = 1.0 the presence of inhomogeneous ignition behavior
   significantly reduced the accuracy of predictions if the auto-ignition
   delay time was greater than similar to 1 ms. These results indicate that
   while lowering phi may not eliminate inhomogeneous ignition behaviors,
   the subsequent effect of these behaviors on the predictive accuracy of
   typical zero-dimensional ignition modeling can be reduced or eliminated.

Title = {{A new limiting procedure for discontinuous Galerkin methods applied to
   compressible multiphase flows with shocks and interfaces}},

Abstract = {{Although the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method has seen widespread use
   for compressible flow problems in a single fluid with constant material
   properties, it has yet to be implemented in a consistent fashion for
   compressible multiphase flows with shocks and interfaces. Specifically,
   it is challenging to design a scheme that meets the following
   requirements: conservation, high-order accuracy in smooth regions and
   non-oscillatory behavior at discontinuities (in particular, material
   interfaces). Following the interface-capturing approach of Abgrall
   {[}1], we model flows of multiple fluid components or phases using a
   single equation of state with variable material properties;
   discontinuities in these properties correspond to interfaces. To
   represent compressible phenomena in solids, liquids, and gases, we
   present our analysis for equations of state belonging to the
   Mie-Gruneisen family. Within the DG framework, we propose a
   conservative, high-order accurate, and non-oscillatory limiting
   procedure, verified with simple multifluid and multiphase problems. We
   show analytically that two key elements are required to prevent spurious
   pressure oscillations at interfaces and maintain conservation: (i) the
   transport equation(s) describing the material properties must be solved
   in a non-conservative weak form, and (ii) the suitable variables must be
   limited (density, momentum, pressure, and appropriate properties
   entering the equation of state), coupled with a consistent
   reconstruction of the energy. Further, we introduce a physics-based
   discontinuity sensor to apply limiting in a solution-adaptive fashion.
   We verify this approach with one- and two-dimensional problems with
   shocks and interfaces, including high pressure and density ratios, for
   fluids obeying different equations of state to illustrate the robustness
   and versatility of the method. The algorithm is implemented on parallel
   graphics processing units (Gm) to achieve high speedup. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Graphene and its derivatives have attracted much attention in
   application of electrochemical devices. Construction of
   three-dimensional (3D) heterostructured composites is promising for
   establishing high-performance devices, which enables large surface area,
   facilitated ion and electron transport, and synergistic effects between
   multicomponents. Here, we report a simple and general
   sonochemical-assisted synthesis to prepare various 3D porous
   graphene/nanoparticle (i.e., Pt, Au, Pd, Ru, and MnO2) foams using
   colloidal template. The 3D porous network structure of composite foams
   significantly improves a large surface area of around 550 m(2) g(-1)
   compared to the bare graphene (215 m(2) g(-1)). This unique structure of
   3D graphene/MnO2 enables further improvement of electrochemical
   characteristics, compared with bare graphene/MnO2 composite, showing a
   high specific capacitance of 421 F g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), high rate
   capability (97\% retention at 20 A g(-1)), and good cycling performance
   (97\% retention over 1000 cycles). Moreover, electrochemical impedance
   analysis demonstrates that electron and ion transfer are triggered by 3D
   porous structure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Enhanced heat release analysis for advanced multi-mode combustion engine
   experiments}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{465-479}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Advanced combustion strategies, such as Homogeneous-Charge
   Compression-Ignition (HCCI) and Spark-Assisted HCCI or Spark-Assisted
   Compression-Ignition (SAC!) hold considerable promise for improving
   engine efficiencies while maintaining low pollutant emissions, yet few
   models exist that accurately include the important chemical and physical
   mechanisms of these advanced combustion strategies. Further,
   experimental data from advanced combustion engine experiments are not
   well represented using conventional spark ignited analytical tools. This
   paper presents new methods for advanced combustion analysis that
   integrate previous analytical methods with new algorithms to capture the
   unique features of advanced combustion strategies like SACI.
   The new analytical capabilities were incorporated into a program which
   was designated the Advanced Combustion Engine Heat Release Analysis
   (ACE-HRA) tool. The models developed and applied in ACE-HRA were
   assessed by comparison with high fidelity engine simulations of HCCI and
   SACI. The high fidelity simulations provided data sets with detailed
   predictions of heat release rates, temperatures, auto-ignition timing,
   flame speeds and other key parameters not resolved or measured in engine
   experiments. The sensitivity of ACE-HRA estimates to model input data
   was quantified for important engine performance parameters. The
   sensitivity analysis showed that estimates for in-cylinder masses have
   the largest overall impact on the ACE-HRA results (e.g. +/- 10\%
   variation led to changes on the order of +/- 5-10\% in peak rate of heat
   release, burn duration and peak temperature). Noticeable differences in
   peak heat release rate and ringing intensity were also observed when
   comparing cycle-by-cycle analysis against ensemble-average analysis,
   which has implications on how the results are interpreted and applied in
   modeling work.
   After validating ACE-HRA with the high-fidelity simulations, ACE-HRA was
   applied to interpret the data from a recent experimental study of SACI
   combustion. The ACE-HRA methods were used to infer the effects of flame
   propagation on in-cylinder gradients and cycle-to-cycle variability, and
   to provide quantitative estimates for the associated changes in the
   end-gas burn rate. The trends observed, such as the decrease in burn
   rate for later auto-ignition and higher burn fraction by flame, provide
   more in-depth understanding of SACI combustion and demonstrate the
   insight that can be revealed by the new ACE-HRA tool. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Number = {{51}},
Pages = {{15408-15415}},

Abstract = {{The noncovalent binding of the gold hemispheres of polystyrene/gold
   colloidal Janus spheres in aqueous solution was found to depend more
   significantly on the deposition thickness of the particles gold layer
   than the chemistry of a covalently affixed self-assembled monolayer on
   the gold. By means of two-channel confocal laser scanning microscopy,
   salt-induced clustering was observed and quantified for Janus particles
   with gold hemispheres functionalized with a thiol self-assembled
   monolayer that varied in hydrophobicity and chain length. The thickness
   of the gold layer on the Janus particles was also varied from 10 to 40
   nm. The measured cluster distributions were strongly salt dependent,
   with clustering absent at 1 mM salt but present at salt concentrations
   in the range of 2-3 mM. For Janus spheres with a 40 nm thick gold
   hemisphere, the effects of both thiol monolayer hydrophobicity and chain
   length were modest. Varying the gold layer thickness from 10 to 40 nm,
   however, had a significant effect on the cluster distribution; the most
   abundant cluster size shifted from one to seven particles as the gold
   layer thickness increased from 10 to 40 nm. Thus, the gold layer
   thickness had an effect stronger than that of either self-assembled
   monolayer hydrophobicity or chain length on the self-assembly of
   metallodielectric Janus particles into clusters. The dominant effect of
   the metallic layer thickness suggests that van der Waals forces between
   metallic surfaces are more important than hydrophobic interactions in
   determining the pair potential interactions of metallodielectric Janus
   particles.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the carrier dynamics in InGaN/GaN dot-in-nanowire quantum
   dots, revealed by a systematic mapping between the optical properties
   and structural parameters of the quantum dots. Such a study is made
   possible by using quantum dots with precisely controlled locations and
   sizes. We show that the carrier dynamics is governed by two competing
   mechanisms: (1) Excitons are protected from surface recombination by a
   potential barrier formed due to strain relaxation at the sidewall
   surface. (2) Excitons can overcome the potential barrier by tunneling
   and thermal activation. This carrier dynamics model successfully
   explains the following surprising experimental findings on individual
   quantum dots. First, there exist strong statistical correlations among
   multiple optical properties of many individual quantum dots, despite
   variations of these properties resulting from inevitable structural
   variations among the quantum dots. Second, the antibunching property of
   the quantum dot emission exhibits an abnormal ladle-shaped dependence on
   the decay time and temperature. Our results can guide the way toward
   nitride-based high-temperature single-photon emitters and nanophotonic
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the zeroes and poles of the determinant of the retarded Green

   massless fermions interacting via a dipole coupling. For large negative
   values of the dipole coupling constant p, det G(R) possesses only poles
   pointing to a Fermi liquid phase. We show that a duality exists relating
   systems of opposite p. This maps poles of det G(R) at large negative p
   to zeroes of det G(R) at large positive p, indicating that the latter
   corresponds to a Mott insulator phase. This duality suggests that the
   properties of a Mott insulator can be studied by mapping the system to a
   Fermi liquid. Finally, for small values of p, det G(R) contains both
   poles and zeroes (pseudogap phase).}},

Title = {{A biomimetic approach to active self-microencapsulation of proteins in
   PLGA}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{196}},
Pages = {{60-70}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{A biomimetic approach to organic solvent-free microencapsulation of
   proteins based on the self-healing capacity of poly
   (DL)-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microspheres containing
   glycosaminoglycan-like biopolymers (BPs), was examined. To screen BPs,
   aqueous solutions of BP {[}high molecular weight dextran sulfate (HDS),
   low molecular weight dextran sulfate (LDS), chondroitin sulfate (CS),
   heparin (HP), hyaluronic acid (HA), chitosan (CH)] and model protein
   lysozyme (LYZ) were combined in different molar and mass ratios, at 37
   degrees C and pH 7. The BP-PLGA microspheres (20-63 mu m) were prepared
   by a double water-oil-water emulsion method with a range of BP content,
   and trehalose and MgCO3 to control microclimate pH and to create
   percolating pores for protein. Biomimetic active self-encapsulation
   (ASE) of proteins {[}LYZ, vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF)
   and fibroblast growth factor (FgF-20)] was accomplished by incubating
   blank BP-PLGA microspheres in low concentration protein solutions at
   similar to 24 degrees C, for 48 h. Pore closure was induced at 42.5
   degrees C under mild agitation for 42 h. Formulation parameters of
   BP-PLGA microspheres and loading conditions were studied to optimize
   protein loading and subsequent release. LDS and HP were found to bind
   >95\% LYZ at BP: LYZ >0.125 w/w, whereas HDS and CS bound >80\% LYZ at
   BP: LYZ of 0.25-1 and <0.33, respectively. HA-PLGA microspheres were
   found to be not ideal for obtaining high protein loading (>2\% w/w of
   LYZ). Sulfated BP-PLGA microspheres were capable of loading LYZ (-2-7\%
   w/w), VEGF (-4\% w/w), and FgF-20 (-2\% w/w) with high efficiency.
   Protein loading was found to be dependent on the loading solution
   concentration, with higher protein loading obtained at higher loading
   solution concentration within the range investigated. Loading also
   increased with content of sulfated BP in microspheres. Release kinetics
   of proteins was evaluated in-vitro with complete release media
   replacement. Rate and extent of release were found to depend upon volume
   of release (with non-sink conditions observed <5ml release volume for
   similar to 18 mg loaded BP-PLGA microspheres), ionic strength of release
   media and loading solution concentration. HDS-PLGA formulations were
   identified as having ideal loading and release characteristics. These
   optimal microspheres released -73-80\% of the encapsulated LYZ over 60
   days, with >90\% of protein being enzymatically active. Nearly 72\% of
   immunoreactive VEGF was similarly released over 42 days, without
   significant losses in heparin binding affinity in the release medium.

Abstract = {{This paper provides a study on the characterizations of large format
   lithium ion battery cells exposed to extreme high temperature but
   without thermal runaway. A unique test is set up: an extended
   volume-accelerating rate calorimetry (EV-ARC) test is terminated at a
   specific temperature before thermal runaway happens in the battery. The
   battery was cooled down after an EV-ARC test with early termination. The
   performances of the battery before and after the EV-ARC test are
   investigated in detail. The results show that (a) the melting point of
   the separator dictates the reusability of the 25 Ah NCM battery after a
   near-runaway event. The battery cannot be reused after being heated to
   140 degrees C or higher because of the exponential rise in ohmic
   resistance; (b) a battery can lose up to 20\% of its capacity after
   being heated to 120 degrees C just one time; (c) if a battery is cycled
   after a thermal event, its lost capacity may be recovered partially.
   Furthermore, the fading and recovery mechanisms are analyzed by
   incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and a prognostic/mechanistic model.
   Model analysis confirms that the capacity loss at extremely high
   temperature is caused by the increase of the resistance, the loss of
   lithium ion (LLI) at the anode and the loss of active material (LAM) at
   the cathode. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{50}},
Pages = {{15200-15205}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Nanoindentation studies of the mechanical properties of sufficiently
   thin polymer films, supported by stiff substrates, indicate that the
   mechanical moduli are generally higher than those of the bulk. This
   enhancement of the effective modulus, in the thickness range of few
   hundred nanometers, is indicated to be associated with the propagation
   and impingement of the indentation tip induced stress field with the
   rigid underlying substrate; this is the so-called substrate effect. This
   behavior has been rationalized completely in terms of the moduli and
   Poissons ratios of the individual components, for the systems
   investigated thus far. Here we show that for thin supported polymer
   films, in general, information regarding the local chain stiffness and
   local vibrational constants of the polymers provides an appropriate
   rationalization of the overall mechanical response of polymers of
   differing chemical structures and polymer-substrate interactions. Our
   study should provide impetus for atomistic simulations that carefully
   account for the role of intermolecular interactions on the mechanical
   response of supported polymer thin films.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{This letter proposes and analyzes a system composed of many micro-or
   nano-scale batteries. Each battery is a self-contained Li-ion
   micro-battery enclosed in an insulating shell, and can charge/discharge
   wirelessly or through contacts. Thousands of such batteries are carried
   by an inert fluid to form a power fluid to drive an electric vehicle.
   This power fluid can be stored in the tank and replaced easily with a
   fully charged fluid by refilling once its energy is depleted. The system
   can provide better energy density, higher power density, and extremely
   fast ``charging{''} within minutes. The architecture eliminates the
   large over-capacity design in the current battery packs, significantly
   reducing the weight and cost. It would also enable progressive
   improvements of vehicle performance by replacing the micro-batteries.
   The battery system has flexible geometry, and therefore can essentially
   go into a storage space of any geometry, allowing uniform design of
   battery configurations for diverse applications. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Stochastic resonance (SR) is an important approach to detect weak
   vibration signals from heavy background noise. In order to increase the
   calculation speed and improve the weak feature detection performance, a
   new bistable model has been built. With this model, an adaptive and fast
   SR method based on dyadic wavelet transform and least square system
   parameters solving is proposed in this paper. By adding the second-order
   differential item into the traditional bistable model, noise utilization
   can be increased and the quality of SR output signal can be improved.
   The iteration algorithm for implementing the adaptive SR is given.
   Compared with the traditional adaptive SR method, this algorithm does
   not need to set up the searching range and searching step size of the
   system parameters, but only requires a few iterations. The proposed
   method, discrete wavelet transform and the traditional adaptive SR
   method are applied to analyzing simulated vibration signals and
   extracting the fault feature of a rotor system. The contrastive results
   verify the superiority of the proposed method, and it can be effectively
   applied to weak mechanical fault feature extraction. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   activated by the grain boundary to transfer slip across it. However, the
   selected slip system is still determined by the minimization of the
   grain boundary strain energy density condition. These findings have
   implications for modelling the mechanical properties of irradiated
   metals as well as in establishing the mechanism for disrupting the grain
   boundary oxide, which is a necessary prerequisite for
   irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer-stromal interaction is a critical process in tumorigenesis.
   Conventional dish-based co-culture assays simply mix two cell types in
   the same dish: thus, they are deficient in controlling cell locations
   and precisely tracking single cell behavior from heterogeneous cell
   populations. Microfluidic technology can provide a good spatial-temporal
   control of microenvironments, but the control has been typically
   realized by using external pumps, making long-term cultures cumbersome
   and bulky. In this work, we have presented a cell-cell interaction
   microfluidic platform that can accurately control the co-culture
   microenvironment by using a novel electrolytic cell isolation scheme
   without using any valves or pneumatic pumps. The proposed microfluidic
   platform can also precisely control the number of interacting cells and
   pairing ratios to emulate cancer niches. More than 80\% of the chambers
   captured the desired number of cells. The duration of cell isolation can
   be adjusted by electrolytic bubble generation and removal. We have
   verified that the electrolytic process has a negligible effect on cell
   viability and proliferation in our platform. To the best of our
   knowledge, this work is the first attempt to incorporate electrolytic
   bubble generation as a cell isolation method in microfluidics. For proof
   of feasibility, we have performed cell-cell interaction assays between
   prostate cancer (PC3) cells and myoblast (C2C12) cells. The preliminary
   results demonstrated the potential of using electrolysis for
   micro-environmental control during cell culture. Also, the ratio
   controlled cell-cell interaction assays were successfully performed
   which showed that the cell pairing ratios of PC3 to C2C12 affected the
   proliferation rate of myoblast cells due to increased secretion of
   growth factors from prostate cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, multifunctional and heparin-mimicking star-shaped
   supramolecules-deposited 3D porous multilayer films with improved
   biocompatibility were fabricated via a layer-by-layer (LbL)
   self-assembly method on polymeric membrane substrates. Star-shaped
   heparin-mimicking polyanions (including poly(styrenesulfonate-co-sodium
   acrylate; Star-PSS-AANa) and poly(styrenesulfonate-co-poly(ethylene
   glycol)methyl ether methacrylate; Star-PSS-EGMA)) and polycations
   (poly(methyl chloride-quaternized 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate;
   Star-PMeDMA) were first synthesized by atom transfer radical
   polymerization (ATRP) from beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) based cores. Then
   assembly of 3D porous multilayers onto polymeric membrane surfaces was
   carried out by alternating deposition of the polyanions and polycations
   via electrostatic interaction. The surface morphology and composition,
   water contact angle, blood activation, and thrombotic potential as well
   as cell viability for the coated heparin-mimicking films were
   systematically investigated. The results of surface ATR-FTIR spectra and
   XPS spectra verified successful deposition of the star-shaped
   supramolecules onto the biomedical membrane surfaces; scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations revealed
   that the modified substrate had 3D porous surface morphology, which
   might have a great biological influence on the biointerface.
   Furthermore, systematic in vitro investigation of protein adsorption,
   platelet adhesion, human platelet factor 4 (PF4, indicates platelet
   activation), activate partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time
   (TT), coagulation activation (thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT,
   indicates blood coagulant)), and blood-related complement activation
   (C3a and C5a, indicates inflammation potential) confirmed that the
   heparin-mimicking multilayer coated membranes exhibited ultralow blood
   component activations and excellent hemocompatibility. Meanwhile, after
   surface coating, endothelial cell viability was also promoted, which
   indicated that the heparin-mimicking multilayer coating might extend the
   application fields of polymeric membranes in biomedical fields.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion batteries are used as the main power source in many
   electronic and electrical devices. In particular, with the growth in
   battery-powered electric vehicle development, the lithium-ion battery
   plays a critical role in the reliability of vehicle systems. In order to
   provide timely maintenance and replacement of battery systems, it is
   necessary to develop a reliable and accurate battery health diagnostic
   that takes a prognostic approach. Therefore, this paper focuses on two
   main methods to determine a battery's health: (1) Battery
   State-of-Health (SOH) monitoring and (2) Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
   prediction. Both of these are calculated by using a filter algorithm
   known as the Support Vector Regression-Particle Filter (SVR-PF). Models
   for battery SOH monitoring based on SVR-PF are developed with novel
   capacity degradation parameters introduced to determine battery health
   in real time. Moreover, the RUL prediction model is proposed, which is
   able to provide the RUL value and update the RUL probability
   distribution to the End-of-Life cycle. Results for both methods are
   presented, showing that the proposed SOH monitoring and RUL prediction
   methods have good performance and that the SVR-PF has better monitoring
   and prediction capability than the standard particle filter (PF). (C)

Abstract = {{The ever-emerging demands on miniaturization of electronic devices have
   pushed the development of innovative materials with desired properties.
   One major endeavor is the development of organic- or organic-inorganic
   hybrid-based electronics as alternatives or supplements to silicon-based
   devices. Herein we report the first observation of the coexistence of
   resistance switching and ferroelectricity in a metal-organic framework
   (MOF) material, {[}InC16H11N2O8]center dot 1.5H(2)O, denoted as RSMOF-1.
   The electrical resistance of RSMOF-1 can be turned on and off repeatedly
   with a current ratio of 30. A first-principles molecular dynamics
   simulation suggests that the resistive switching effect is related to
   the ferroelectric transition of N center dot center dot center dot H-O
   center dot center dot center dot H-N bridge-structured dipoles of the
   guest water molecules and the amino-tethered MOF nanochannel. The
   discovery of the resistive switching effect and ferroelectricity in MOFs

Abstract = {{This article uses a market-based allocation method in a consequential
   life cycle assessment (LCA) framework to estimate the environmental
   emissions created by recovering carbon dioxide (CO2). We find that 1 ton
   of CO2 recovered as a coproduct of chemicals manufacturing leads to
   additional greenhouse gas emissions of 147-210 kg CO2 eq , while
   consuming 160-248 kWh of electricity, 254-480 MJ of heat, and 1836-4027
   kg of water. The ranges depend on the initial and final purity of the
   CO2, particularly because higher purity grades require additional
   processing steps such as distillation, as well as higher temperature and
   flow rate of regeneration as needed for activated carbon treatment and
   desiccant beds. Higher purity also reduces process efficiency due to
   increased yield losses from regeneration gas and distillation reflux.
   Mass- and revenue-based allocation methods used in attributional LCA
   estimate that recovering CO2 leads to 19 and 11 times the global warming

Abstract = {{The potential utility of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to guide
   clinical care in oncology patients has gained momentum with emerging
   micro-and nanotechnologies. Establishing the role of CTCs in tumor
   progression and metastasis depends both on enumeration and on obtaining
   sufficient numbers of CTCs for downstream assays. The numbers of CTCs
   are few in early stages of cancer, limiting detailed molecular
   characterization. Recent attempts in the literature to culture CTCs
   isolated from metastatic patients using monoculture have had limited
   success rates of less than 20\%. Herein, we have developed a novel
   in-situ capture and culture methodology for ex-vivo expansion of CTCs
   using a three dimensional co-culture model, simulating a tumor
   microenvironment to support tumor development. We have successfully
   expanded CTCs isolated from 14 of 19 early stage lung cancer patients.
   Expanded lung CTCs carried mutations of the TP53 gene identical to those
   observed in the matched primary tumors. Next-generation sequencing
   further revealed additional matched mutations between primary tumor and
   CTCs of cancer-related genes. This strategy sets the stage to further
   characterize the biology of CTCs derived from patients with early lung
   cancers, thereby leading to a better understanding of these putative
   drivers of metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a semi-active battery/supercapacitor (SC) hybrid
   energy storage system (HESS) for use in electric drive vehicles. A much
   smaller unidirectional dc/dc converter is adopted in the proposed HESS
   to integrate the SC and battery, thereby increasing the HESS efficiency
   and reducing the system cost. We have also included a quantitative
   battery capacity fade model, in addition to the theoretical HESS model
   proposed in this paper. For the proposed HESS, we have examined the
   sizing optimization of the HESS parameters for an electric city bus,
   including the parallel and series number of the battery cell and the SC
   module. Considering the constraint of requirement on minimal mileage,
   the optimization goal is to simultaneously minimize (i) the total cost
   of the HESS and (ii) the capacity loss of a LiFePO4 battery over a
   typical China Bus Driving Cycle. The simulation result shows that these
   two objectives are conflicting, and trades them off using a
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. Finally, the Pareto front
   including optimal HESS parameter groups has been obtained, which
   indicates that the battery capacity loss can be reduced rapidly when the
   SC cost increases within the range from 10 to 40 thousand RMB. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this study, we present the synthesis of a carbazole-bridged porphyrin
   dimer system that possesses a 90 degrees change in orientation between
   porphyrin units and the single-product four dimer macrocycle, which is
   formed upon self-assembly of the dimer via imidazolyl-to-zinc
   complementary coordination. Subsequent characterization of the
   two-photon absorption and ultrafast emission lifetimes of these systems
   indicates a very strong coupling between constituent dimers in the
   assembled macrocycle structure. These interactions lead to a red-shifted
   two-photon response and a full order of magnitude increase in the
   two-photon absorption (TPA) cross section per building block with
   respect to the lone dimer. Excitonic coupling through the slipped
   cofacial arrangement created by imidazolyl-to-zinc interaction has been
   shown to play a critical role in the observed TPA enhancement. This
   points to the use of our small light-harvesting mimic for nonlinear
   optical applications in which aggregation effects have often stymied
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are believed to play an important role in
   metastasis, a process responsible for the majority of cancer-related
   deaths. But their rarity in the bloodstream makes microfluidic isolation
   complex and time-consuming. Additionally the low processing speeds can
   be a hindrance to obtaining higher yields of CTCs, limiting their
   potential use as biomarkers for early diagnosis. Here, a high throughput
   microfluidic technology, the OncoBean Chip, is reported. It employs
   radial flow that introduces a varying shear profile across the device,
   enabling efficient cell capture by affinity at high flow rates. The
   recovery from whole blood is validated with cancer cell lines H1650 and
   MCF7, achieving a mean efficiency >80\% at a throughput of 10 mL h(-1)
   in contrast to a flow rate of 1 mL h(-1) standardly reported with other
   microfluidic devices. Cells are recovered with a viability rate of 93\%
   at these high speeds, increasing the ability to use captured CTCs for
   downstream analysis. Broad clinical application is demonstrated using
   comparable flow rates from blood specimens obtained from breast,
   pancreatic, and lung cancer patients. Comparable CTC numbers are
   recovered in all the samples at the two flow rates, demonstrating the
   ability of the technology to perform at high throughputs.}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-derived particles surrounded
   by a (phospho) lipid bilayer that are released by cells in the human
   body. In addition to direct cell-to-cell contact and the secretion of
   soluble factors, EVs function as another mechanism of intercellular
   communication. These vesicles are able to efficiently deliver their
   parental cell-derived molecular cargo to recipient cells, which can
   result in structural changes at an RNA, protein, or even phenotypic
   level. For this reason, EVs have recently gained much interest for drug
   delivery purposes. In contrast to these `natural delivery systems',
   synthetic (phospho) lipid vesicles, or liposomes, have been employed as
   drug carriers for decades, resulting in several approved liposomal
   nanomedicines used in the clinic. This review discusses the similarities
   and differences between EVs and liposomes with the focus on features
   that are relevant for drug delivery purposes such as circulation time,
   biodistribution, cellular interactions and cargo loading. By applying
   beneficial features of EVs to liposomes and vice versa, improved drug
   carriers can be developed which will advance the field of nanomedicines
   and ultimately improve patient outcomes. While the application of EVs
   for therapeutic drug delivery is still in its infancy, issues regarding
   the understanding of EV biogenesis, large-scale production and in vivo
   interactions need to be addressed in order to develop successful and
   cost-effective EV-based drug delivery systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that liquid-feed flame spray pyrolysis (LF-FSP)
   processing provides non-aggregated nanopowders that can be used
   immediately to tape cast, producing thin films (<100 mu m) of Li+ ion

   methods are commonly used for such but require additional high-energy
   milling and/or calcining to obtain powder feedstock.
   Li1+x+yAlxTi2-xSiyP3-yO12 (x = 0.1, 0.3/y = 0.2, 0.4) nanopowders were
   prepared by LF-FSP with a primary focus on the effects of Al-0.3/Si-0.4
   doping on conductivities. Furthermore, the effects of excess Li2O on
   Al-0.3/Si-0.4 doped materials were studied. Li1.7Al0.3Ti1.7Si0.4P2.6O12
   pellets sintered to 93-94\% of theoretical density and samples with
   varying excess Li2O contents all show superionic conductivities of 2 -3
   x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature. Li2O lowers both the
   crystallization temperatures and temperatures required to sinter. Total
   conductivities range from 2 x 10(-3) to 5 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) in the
   temperature span of 25 degrees-125 degrees C. Small grain sizes of 600
   +/- 200 nm were produced. Initial attempts to make thin films gave-films
   with thicknesses of 52 +/- 1 mu m on sintering just to 1000 degrees C.
   Measured conductivities were 3-5 x 10(-4) S cm(-1); attributed to final

Abstract = {{The cure kinetics of epoxy cured with an amine hardener is investigated
   using a combination of light scattering techniques. Concurrent Raman and
   Brillouin scattering are used to monitor the formation of epoxy networks
   over time in terms of both the structural connectivity of the network
   and the evolution of chemical bonding configurations. The relationship
   between the elastic properties of the network and the degree of cure was
   found to depend on the cure temperature and the resinhardener
   stoichiometry. A numerical model was created to determine the degree of
   cure and elastic modulus as a function of time and cure conditions.
   Accordingly, the modulus of the epoxy comprises two contributions: one
   directly related to the concentration of covalent bonds that form and
   another one due to nonbonding interactions that arise as the network
   relaxes into an optimally packed configuration.}},

Abstract = {{The He-3 (helium) accumulation due to tritium decays in rare-earth metal
   tritides can influence their mechanical properties and stabilities,
   limiting their applications as neutron generators. Ab initio
   calculations based on density functional theory have been performed to
   investigate the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus and
   Young's modulus of the beta-MH2-xHex (M = Er, Sc) systems, with the
   variety of the x (the ratio of He to M atoms), ranging from 0 to 0.1875.
   The changes in the mechanical properties of beta-ErH2-xHex and
   beta-ScH2-xHex exhibit two regimes, which is in agreement with the
   experimental observations. It appears that the different He
   concentrations cause the different interactions between metal atoms and
   their neighbors in beta-MH2-xHex, a key factor which gives rise to the
   observed two regimes. When x is about 0.13, the mechanical properties of
   metal hydrides degrade significantly. Furthermore, the degradation
   mechanisms of the mechanical properties in the beta-MH2-xHex systems
   depend mainly on the crystal structure of metal hydrides.}},

Title = {{A haemodynamic predictor of intraluminal thrombus formation in abdominal

   SCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{Intraluminal thrombus (ILT) is present in over 75\% of all abdominal
   aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and probably contributes to the complex
   biomechanics and pathobiology of these lesions. A reliable predictor of
   thrombus formation in enlarging lesions could thereby aid clinicians in
   treatment planning. The primary goal of this work was to identify a new
   phenomenological metric having clinical utility that is motivated by the
   hypothesis that two basic haemodynamic features must coincide spatially
   and temporally to promote the formation of a thrombus on an intact
   endothelium-platelets must be activated within a shear flow and then be
   presented to a susceptible endothelium. Towards this end, we propose a
   new thrombus formation potential (TFP) that combines information on the
   flow-induced shear history experienced by blood-borne particles that
   come in close proximity to the endothelium with information on both the
   time-averaged wall shear stress (WSS) and the oscillatory shear index
   (OSI) that locally affect the endothelial mechanobiology. To illustrate
   the possible utility of this new metric, we show computational results
   for 10 carotid arteries from five patients where regions of low WSS and
   high OSI tend not to be presented with activated platelets (i.e. they
   have a low TFP), consistent with the thrombo-resistance of the healthy
   carotid despite its complex haemodynamics. Conversely, we show results
   for three patients that high TFP co-localizes with regions of observed
   thin thrombus in AAAs, which contrasts with findings of low TFP for the
   abdominal aorta of three healthy subjects. We submit that these
   promising results suggest the need for further consideration of the TFP,
   or a similar combined metric, as a potentially useful clinical predictor
   of the possible formation of ILT in AAAs.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of a SEI layer and its growth cause internal resistance
   increase and capacity loss, leading to performance degradation of
   lithium-ion batteries. In order to comprehensively investigate the
   effects of SEI growth on battery performance, a one-dimensional
   thermal-electrochemical model was developed. This model is equipped with
   a growth mechanism of the SEI layer coupled with thermal evolution,
   based on the diffusional process of the solvent through the SEI layer
   and the kinetic process at the interface between the solid and liquid
   phases. The model is able to reveal the effects of diffusivity, reaction
   kinetics and temperature on SEI layer growth and cell capacity fade. We
   show that depending on the SEI thickness, the growth can be
   kinetics-limited or diffusion-limited. With the layer becoming thicker,
   its growth rate slows down gradually due to increased diffusion
   resistance. The SEI layer grows faster during charge than discharge due
   to the difference in the electron flux through the SEI layer and the
   temperature change during cycling. Temperature rise due to reaction and
   joule heating accelerates the SEI layer growth, leading to more capacity
   loss. Our model can provide insights on position-dependent SEI growth
   rate and be used to guide the strategic monitoring location. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The performance and thermal response of large-scale GS-Yuasa LEV50 50-Ah
   NMC automotive battery cells were investigated via simulation. To
   evaluate local transient temperature distributions, the Dualfoil model
   was coupled to local energy-balance equations. At similar C rates the
   difference between maximum and minimum temperature in the LEV50 was
   found to be higher than that in an 18650 cell with identical chemistry.
   Unlike thinner prismatic lithium ion batteries, the temperature
   variation through the cell thickness in the large-format cell was not
   negligible (-5 degrees C at 4C discharge). Because of the non-uniform
   temperature distribution within the jellyroll, the risk of lithium
   plating at high charging rates and low ambient temperatures may be
   greater toward the jellyroll exterior. Simulations of thermal abuse
   (oven test) of the large cell showed a delayed thermal response relative
   to the 18650, but also indicated a lower onset temperature for thermal
   runaway. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We adopt atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the
   solvation and gelation behavior of homogeneous methylcellulose (MC) and
   model random oligomers that represent the commercial cellulosic polymer
   product METHOCEL A in water and acetone solvents. We demonstrate that
   the two carbohydrate-specific GROMOS force fields, GROMOS 45A4 and
   56Acarbo, are capable of reproducing characteristic angle distributions
   and the persistence length of MC chains reported in the literature. We
   then use the GROMOS 56Acarbo force field in both single-chain and
   multiple-chain simulations to characterize their solvation behavior
   through radial distribution functions, hydrogen-bond counts, and contact
   map analyses. We find that the un-methylated O6 position on the
   cellulose ring forms the most hydrogen bonds, followed by O2 and O3,
   implying that methylation at the 6 position reduces hydrogen bonding
   more than does methylation at other positions. O6-O6 is the most
   probable intermolecular hydrogen bond between different MC molecules.
   Dimethylated and trimethylated MCs form aggregated structures at low
   temperatures and precipitate-like structures at high temperatures in
   water but disperse randomly in acetone. This is consistent with
   experimental observations of gelation at elevated temperatures in water.
   The heterogeneous METHOCEL A model shows increased aggregation of
   trimethylated monomer units at elevated temperatures, suggesting that
   hydrophobic interaction is the main factor that induces the gelation,
   rather than hydrogen bonding.}},

Abstract = {{In engineering applications, a suspension system may be attached to a
   flexible host structure, e.g. spacecraft truss, to provide vibration
   isolation for sensitive instrumentation, where the suspension and host
   structure dynamics are strongly coupled. For linear suspensions, a
   resonance normally occurs adjacent to the roll-off frequency band, which
   significantly and detrimentally amplifies vibration transmission. To
   avoid the adverse resonance for operational safety enhancement, this
   research proposes a nonlinear bistable suspension and evaluates its
   performance when attached to a flexible host structure. Dynamic models
   of the bistable and comparable linear suspensions attached to the host
   structure are formulated, and steady-state responses are predicted using
   analytical and numerical methods. Results show that the bistable
   suspension can eliminate the harmful resonance via a dynamic
   stabilization phenomenon, and simultaneously retains the favorable
   isolation performance in the roll-off bandwidth as compared to the
   linear suspension. Series of experimental investigations support the
   analytical and numerical findings and help define design guidelines for
   operational safety improvement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{During embryogenesis and tissue maintenance and repair in an adult
   organism, a myriad of stem cells are regulated by their surrounding
   extracellular matrix (ECM) enriched with tissue/organ-specific nanoscale
   topographical cues to adopt different fates and functions. Attributed to
   their capability of self-renewal and differentiation into most types of
   somatic cells, stem cells also hold tremendous promise for regenerative
   medicine and drug screening. However, a major challenge remains as to
   achieve fate control of stem cells in vitro with high specificity and
   yield. Recent exciting advances in nanotechnology and materials science
   have enabled versatile, robust, and large-scale stem cell engineering in
   vitro through developments of synthetic nanotopographical surfaces
   mimicking topological features of stem cell niches. In addition to
   generating new insights for stem cell biology and embryonic development,
   this effort opens up unlimited opportunities for innovations in stem
   cell-based applications. This review is therefore to provide a summary
   of recent progress along this research direction, with perspectives
   focusing on emerging methods for generating nanotopographical surfaces
   and their applications in stem cell research. Furthermore, we provide a
   review of classical as well as emerging cellular mechano-sensing and
   -transduction mechanisms underlying stem cell nanotopography sensitivity
   and also give some hypotheses in regard to how a multitude of signaling
   events in cellular mechanotransduction may converge and be integrated
   into core pathways controlling stem cell fate in response to
   extracellular nanotopography. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{EARTHQUAKES AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1283-1301}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ground motion modification is extensively used in seismic design of
   civil infrastructure, especially where few or no recorded ground motions
   representative of the design scenario are available. A site in Los
   Angeles, California is used as a study site and 28 ground motions
   consistent with the design earthquake scenario are selected. The suite
   of 28 ground motions is scaled and modified in the time domain (TD) and
   frequency domain (FD) before being used as input to a bilinear SDOF
   system. The median structural responses to the suites of scaled,
   TD-modified, and FD-modified motions, along with ratios of he
   modified-to-scaled responses, are investigated for SDOF systems with
   different periods, strength ratios, and post-yield stiffness ratios.
   Overall, little difference (less than 20\%) is observed in the peak
   structural accelerations, velocities, and displacements; displacement
   ductility; and absolute accelerations caused by the TD-modified and
   FD-modified motions when compared to the responses caused by the scaled
   motions. The energy absorbed by the system when the modified motions are
   used as input is more than 20\% greater than when scaled motions are
   used as input. The observed trends in the structural response are
   predominantly the result of changes in the ground motion characteristics
   caused by modification.}},

Title = {{Pitch angle distributions of electrons at dipolarization sites during
   geomagnetic activity: THEMIS observations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Changes in pitch angle distributions of electrons with energies from a
   few eV to 1 MeV at dipolarization sites in Earth's magnetotail are
   investigated statistically to determine the extent to which adiabatic
   acceleration may contribute to these changes. Forty-two dipolarization
   events from 2008 and 2009 observed by Time History of Events and
   Macroscale Interactions during Substorms probes covering the inner
   plasma sheet from 8 R-E to 12 R-E during geomagnetic activity identified
   by the AL index are analyzed. The number of observed events with
   cigar-type distributions (peaks at 0 degrees and 180 degrees) decreases
   sharply below 1 keV after dipolarization because in many of these
   events, electron distributions becamemore isotropized. From above 1 keV
   to a few tens of keV, however, the observed number of cigar-type events
   increases after dipolarization and the number of isotropic events
   decreases. These changes can be related to the ineffectiveness of Fermi
   acceleration below 1 keV (at those energies, dipolarization time becomes
   comparable to electron bounce time). Model-calculated pitch angle
   distributions after dipolarization with the effect of betatron and Fermi
   acceleration tested indicate that these adiabatic acceleration
   mechanisms can explain the observed patterns of event number changes
   over a large range of energies for cigar events and isotropic events.
   Other factors still need to be considered to assess the observed
   increase in cigar events around 2 keV. Indeed, preferential directional
   increase/loss of electron fluxes, which may contribute to the formation
   of cigar events, was observed. Nonadiabatic processes to accelerate
   electrons in a parallel direction may also be important for future
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Preliminary aircraft design studies use structural weight models that
   are calibrated with data from existing aircraft. Computing weights with
   these models is a fast procedure that provides reliable weight estimates
   when the candidate designs lie within the domain of the data used for
   calibration. However, this limitation is too restrictive when we wish to
   assess the relative benefits of new structural technologies and new
   aircraft configurations early in the design process. To address this
   limitation, we present a computationally efficient aerostructural design
   framework for initial aircraft design studies that uses a full
   finite-element model of key structural components to better assess the
   potential benefits of new technologies. We use a three-dimensional panel
   method to predict the aerodynamic forces and couple the lifting surface
   deflections to compute the deformed aerodynamic flying shape. To be used
   early in the design cycle, the aerostructural computations must be fast,
   robust, and allow for significant design flexibility. To address these
   requirements, we develop a geometry parametrization technique that
   enables large geometric modifications, we implement a parallel

Abstract = {{Intermediate disturbances shape forest structure and composition, which
   may in turn alter carbon, nitrogen, and water cycling. We used a
   large-scale experiment in a forest in northern lower Michigan where we
   prescribed an intermediate disturbance by stem girdling all
   canopy-dominant early successional trees to simulate an accelerated
   age-related senescence associated with natural succession. Using 3 years
   of eddy covariance and sap flux measurements in the disturbed area and
   an adjacent control plot, we analyzed disturbance-induced changes to
   plot level and species-specific transpiration and stomatal conductance.
   We found transpiration to be similar to 15\% lower in disturbed plots
   than in unmanipulated control plots. However, species-specific responses
   to changes in microclimate varied. While red oak and white pine showed
   increases in stomatal conductance during postdisturbance (62.5 and
   132.2\%, respectively), red maple reduced stomatal conductance by
   36.8\%. We used the hysteresis between sap flux and vapor pressure
   deficit to quantify diurnal hydraulic stress incurred by each species in
   both plots. Red oak, a ring porous anisohydric species, demonstrated the
   largest mean relative hysteresis, while red maple, bigtooth aspen, and
   paper birch, all diffuse porous species, had the lowest relative
   hysteresis. We employed the Penman-Monteith model for LE to demonstrate
   that these species-specific responses to disturbance are not well
   captured using current modeling strategies and that accounting for
   changes to leaf area index and plot microclimate are insufficient to
   fully describe the effects of disturbance on transpiration.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Measurements of pelvic floor muscle strength are
   contaminated by crosstalk from intra-abdominal pressure. We tested an
   improved instrumented speculum designed to minimize this crosstalk. The
   hypotheses were that the speculum yields: 1) maximum vaginal closure
   forces unrelated to intra-abdominal pressure, 2) discriminatory validity
   between women with strong vs. weak pelvic floor muscles, and 3)
   acceptable test-retest reliability.
   Methods: Maximum voluntary vaginal closure force was measured in 40
   incontinent women (20-77 years) on two visits spaced one month apart. At
   the baseline visit, intra-abdominal pressure was also estimated via
   intra-vesical catheterization during the vaginal closure force
   measurement. Subjective estimate of pelvic floor muscle strength was
   also assessed using digital palpation by a skilled examiner to determine
   group placement as ``strong{''} (n = 31) or ``weak{''} (n = 9).
   Findings: Vaginal closure force was not significantly correlated with
   intra-abdominal pressure (r = -26, P = .109). The groups with
   subjectively scored strong and weak pelvic floor muscles differed
   significantly by mean {[}SD] maximum vaginal closure force (3.8 {[}1.7]
   vs. 1.9 {[}0.8] N respectively, P < .01.) Across both time points the
   mean vaginal closure force was 3.42 {[}1.67] N with a range of .68 to
   9.05 N. Mean Visit 1 and Visit 2 vaginal closure force scores did not
   differ (3.41 {[}1.8] and 3.42 {[}1.6] N, respectively). The vaginal
   closure force repeatability coefficient was 3.1 N.
   Interpretation: The improved speculum measured maximum vaginal closure
   force without evidence of crosstalk from intra-abdominal pressure, while
   retaining acceptable discriminant validity and repeatability. (C) 2014

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic trees are typically constructed using genetic and genomic
   data, and provide robust evolutionary relationships of species from the
   genomic point of view. We present an application of network motif mining
   and analysis of metabolic pathways that when used in combination with
   phylogenetic trees can provide a more complete picture of evolution. By
   using distributions of three-node motifs as a proxy for metabolic
   similarity, we analyze the ancestral origin of Eukaryotic organelles
   from the metabolic point of view to illustrate the application of our
   motif mining and analysis network approach. Our analysis suggests that
   the hypothesis of an early proto-Eukaryote could be valid. It also
   suggests that a delta- or epsilon-Proteobacteria may have been the
   endosymbiotic partner that gave rise to modern mitochondria. Our
   evolutionary analysis needs to be extended by building metabolic network
   reconstructions of species from the phylum Crenarchaeota, which is
   considered to be a possible archaeal ancestor of the eukaryotic cell. In
   this paper, we also propose a methodology for constructing phylogenetic
   trees that incorporates metabolic network signatures to identify regions
   of genomically-estimated phylogenies that may be spurious. We find that
   results generated from our approach are consistent with a parallel
   phylogenetic analysis using the method of feature frequency profiles.

Abstract = {{Tungsten was irradiated with 400 key Kr+ ions using the IVEM-Tandem
   Facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The evolution of microstructure
   and gas bubbles during the irradiation was observed by in situ
   transmission electron microscopy. Under irradiation, dislocation loops
   were created and grew into an increased density of network dislocations
   with increasing Kr+ ion fluence. The irradiation induced final
   microstructure consists of dislocation cells similar to 50 nm in
   diameter separated by dislocation walls. The irradiation also induced
   formation of Kr gas bubbles with an average diameter of 1.4 nm after 3.0
   x 10(16) ions/cm(2) at 525 K. The gas bubbles were observed to grow to
   2.6 nm diameter after additional Kr-irradiation of 5.0 x 10(16)
   ions/cm(2) at 815 K. The relationship between bubble size and
   irradiation time was obtained from experimental data obtained at 815 K
   and an empirical formula for calculating Kr bubble size was developed by
   fitting bubble growth equations with experiment data. The growth
   mechanisnis of Kr gas bubbles in tungsten are discussed. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A 14Cr-ODS ferritic steel with the nominal compositions of Fe-14Cr-2
   W-0.3Ti-0.3Y(2)O(3) (wt:\%) was produced by mechanical alloying (MA) and
   hot isostatic pressing (HIP). Helium ion was implanted into the 14Cr-ODS
   steel along with Eurofer 97 steel as reference at 400 degrees C to a
   fluence of 1 x 10(17) He/cm(2). High resolution transmission electron
   microscopy (HRTEM), high angle annual dark field (HAADF) scanning TEM
   (STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) were used to characterize the
   microstructure of 14Cr-ODS and Eurofer 97 steels before and after helium
   implantation. High-density Y-Ti-O-rich nanoclusters and Y2Ti2O7
   precipitates as well as large Cr-Ti rich oxides were observed in the
   14Cr-ODS steel. The average size of Y-Ti-O nanoclusters and Y2Ti2O7
   precipitates is 9 nm. After helium implantation, the helium bubbles
   formed in the 14Cr-ODS steel exhibit the smaller Size and the lower
   volume fraction than that in Eurofer 97 steel, indicating high-density
   nano-scale precipitates can effectively suppress the coarsening of
   helium bubbles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Comparison of discrete element method and traditional modeling methods
   for steady-state wheel-terrain interaction of small vehicles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TERRAMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{61-75}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A simulation study was conducted to evaluate three terramechanics
   methods for predicting single wheel performance of small vehicles on
   granular terrain. Traditional Bekker-type terramechanics methods do not
   consider the soil profile, soil dynamics, or transient wheel dynamics,
   which can be important factors in vehicle performance. The `dynamic
   Bekker' method treats the wheel as a free body and discretizes the soil
   into grid regions, which allows for multibody dynamics simulations on
   more complex soil profiles. Another option is to use the discrete
   element method (DEM), which makes fewer assumptions but requires
   significantly more computation time. Before these methods can be
   evaluated in dynamic conditions, they must first be tested in
   steady-state conditions. Single-wheel experiments were performed on
   Mojave Martian Simulant to evaluate performance at various slip ratios.
   Similar tests were simulated using traditional Bekker, dynamic Bekker,
   and DEM. Each method was tuned to match direct shear and
   pressure-sinkage tests performed on the same soil. While Bekker-type
   methods only require curve-fitting to determine soil parameters, the
   discrete element method was tuned by simulating the soil tests with
   varying parameters. The results from this study show DEM can better
   predict wheel performance both qualitatively and quantitatively, though
   at a considerably higher computation cost. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on

Abstract = {{Using the ideal magnetohydrodynamic model, we calculate the temporal
   evolution of initial ripples on the boundaries of a planar plasma slab
   that is subjected to the magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The plasma
   slab consists of three regions. We assume that in each region the plasma
   density is constant with an arbitrary value and the magnetic field is
   also constant with an arbitrary magnitude and an arbitrary direction
   parallel to the interfaces. Thus, the instability may be driven by a
   combination of magnetic pressure and kinetic pressure. The general
   dispersion relation is derived, together with the feedthrough factor
   between the two interfaces. The temporal evolution is constructed from
   the superposition of the eigenmodes. Previously established results are
   recovered in the various limits. Numerical examples are given on the
   temporal evolution of ripples on the interfaces of the finite plasma
   slab. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTONOMOUS MENTAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Following work on designing optimal rewards for single agents, we define
   a multiagent optimal rewards problem (ORP) in cooperative (specifically,
   common-payoff or team) settings. This new problem solves for individual
   agent reward functions that guide agents to better overall team
   performance relative to teams in which all agents guide their behavior
   with the same given team-reward function. We present a multiagent
   architecture in which each agent learns good reward functions from
   experience using a gradient-based algorithm in addition to performing
   the usual task of planning good policies (except in this case with
   respect to the learned rather than the given reward function).
   Multiagency introduces the challenge of nonstationarity: because the
   agents learn simultaneously, each agent's reward-learning problem is
   nonstationary and interdependent on the other agents evolving reward
   functions. We demonstrate on two simple domains that the proposed
   architecture outperforms the conventional approach in which all the
   agents use the same given team-reward function (even when accounting for
   the resource overhead of the reward learning); that the learning
   algorithm performs stably despite the nonstationarity; and that learning
   individual reward functions can lead to better specialization of roles
   than is possible with shared reward, whether learned or given.}},

Abstract = {{A serpentine transmission-line in a microstrip configuration is used to

   Specifically demonstrated with silicon substrates coupled to standard
   charge-sensitive preamplifiers, a meandering electrode is used to enable
   lateral position sensing to within an approximately 1 cm length along
   the electrode. Configured in a rectilinear shape, the lateral resolution
   is therefore equivalent to the strip pitch, which we have made as small
   as 4 mu m. The position-of-interaction is extracted using either timing
   or amplitude techniques, both enabled by the slow-wave propagation
   structure inherent to the standard metal-semiconductor-insulator
   configuration of the bounding electrodes, the analysis of which is
   summarized and compared experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the origin of threshold voltage (V-th) shift of amorphous
   In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs), a combination of
   bias-temperature stress (BTS) and multi-frequency capacitance-voltage
   (C-V) measurements were used to evaluate the impact of oxygen partial
   pressure (P-O2) during a-IGZO deposition on TFT electrical properties,
   electrical stability, and density of states (DOS). The extracted sub-gap
   DOS was decomposed into exponential bandtail states and Gaussian-like
   deep-gap states. The peak density of Gaussian-like states is larger for
   higher P-O2. We conclude that the Gaussian-like states are
   excess/weakly-bonded oxygen in the form of O-0 or O-1-ions acting as
   acceptor-like states and are at the origin of TFT threshold voltage
   shift during positive BTS. (C) 2014 The Japan Society of Applied Physics}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, results of a numerical study on pore continuity,
   permeability and durability of cementitious slurries for carbon
   sequestration projects are presented. The hydration model Hymostruc is
   used to simulate and visualize 3D virtual microstructures which are used
   to demonstrate the contribution of capillary pores to the continuity of
   the capillary pore system embedded in an evolving cementitious
   microstructure. Once capillary pores are blocked due to ongoing
   hydration, transport of CO2 species through the microstructure is
   avoided which may protect the slurry from leakage. Evaluating the pore
   continuity of the capillary pore system during hydration of the
   microstructure is therefore indispensable for a robust cementitious
   sealing material and is the main objective for slurry design.
   Simulations are conducted on slurries exposed to ambient temperatures of
   20 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 60 degrees C, and a durability outlook
   regarding the CO2 ingress is given as well. Aggregates and associated
   interfacial transition zones (ITZs) are introduced in the slurry system
   that may cause alternative porous path ways through the system. Pore
   continuity analysis shows the relevance of numerical simulations for
   assessing the capillary pore structure inside an evolving microstructure
   in relation to its sealing and durability performance.}},

Abstract = {{We subjected a set of model compounds (cornstarch and cellulose as model
   polysaccharides, soy protein and albumin as model proteins, sunflower
   oil and castor oil as model lipids) to the processing conditions and
   product recovery protocol commonly used for hydrothermal liquefaction
   (HTL) of algal biomass to make crude bio-oil. The model compounds were
   treated individually and in mixtures at 300 and 350 degrees C for batch
   holding time ranging from 10 min to 90 min. The model lipids produced
   the highest yield (>90 wt?\%) of biocrude (operationally defined as
   material soluble in dichloromethane), followed by the model proteins
   similar to 30-35 wt\%) and then the model polysaccharides (similar to
   10-15 wt\%). The production of biocrude at 350 degrees C occurred fully
   within the first 10 min of treatment, and the biocrude yield changed
   very little at longer times. Liquefaction at 350 degrees C and 60 min
   nearly doubled the biocrude yields from polysaccharides, relative to
   those obtained at 300 degrees C and 20 min. Otherwise, the yields from
   the different model compounds at the milder and the more-severe
   conditions were comparable. In most instances, the biocrude yield from
   hydrothermal treatment of mixtures was very similar to the mass-averaged
   yield calculated from the individual compound results. The chief
   exceptions were binary combinations of polysaccharide and protein under
   the more-severe conditions. For these mixtures, the biocrude yield
   exceeded the mass-average yield calculated from the pure compound
   results, thereby providing evidence that interactions influencing the
   biocrude yield can occur during hydrothermal treatment of mixtures of
   the biomolecules. Even so, a quantitative model built on the assumption
   that the lipids, polysaccharides, and proteins react independently
   during HTL predicted biocrude yields for ternary mixtures more
   accurately than did a model with three additional parameters that
   allowed for the possibility of interactions between the different model
   compounds.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the bandwidth efficiency (throughput) and the
   energy efficiency of relay networks considering both the physical layer
   and the medium access control (MAC) layer. Due to wireless signal power
   attenuation with transmission distance, using a relay for packet
   transmissions can lead to more energy-efficient wireless networking at
   the expense of requiring multihop transmissions. To understand the
   potential benefits of using a relay, the energy-throughput tradeoff
   needs to be analyzed. In a decentralized wireless network, not only the
   physical layer but also the MAC layer should be considered. At the
   physical layer, the transmit power determines the area which contains
   nodes that might be contending for channel access at the MAC layer. At
   the MAC layer, gaining access to the channel entails transmitting
   various signals at the physical layer. This uses energy and takes time,
   which impacts the bandwidth efficiency. We analyze the energy
   consumption and the throughput of relay networks as a function of the
   transmit power. We determine the conditions in which wireless
   communication using a relay has better energy efficiency or bandwidth
   efficiency than direct transmission.}},

Journal = {{MICROMACHINES}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1254-1269}},

Abstract = {{ability to elicit distinct duty cycles from the same self-regulating
   microfluidic oscillator device would greatly enhance the versatility of
   this micro-machine as a tool, capable of recapitulating in vitro the
   diverse oscillatory processes that occur within natural systems. We
   report a novel approach to realize this using the coordinated modulation
   of input volumetric flow rate ratio and fluidic capacitance ratio. The
   demonstration uses a straightforward experimental system where fluid
   inflow to the oscillator is provided by two syringes (of symmetric or
   asymmetric cross-sectional area) mounted upon a single syringe pump
   applying pressure across both syringes at a constant linear velocity.
   This produces distinct volumetric outflow rates from each syringe that
   are proportional to the ratio between their cross-sectional areas. The
   difference in syringe cross-sectional area also leads to differences in
   fluidic capacitance; this underappreciated capacitive difference allows
   us to present a simplified expression to determine the microfluidic
   oscillators duty cycle as a function of cross-sectional area.
   Examination of multiple total volumetric inflows under asymmetric inflow
   rates yielded predictable and robust duty cycles ranging from 50\% to
   90\%. A method for estimating the outflow duration for each inflow under
   applied flow rate ratios is provided to better facilitate the
   utilization of this system in experimental protocols requiring specific
   stimulation and rest intervals.}},

Abstract = {{A challenge for high-power millimeter-wave (mmw) traveling-wave tube
   (TWT) amplifiers is to realize high-power operation without incurring
   oscillation from backward-wave (BW) interaction. Conventional wisdom
   purports that contrawound (including ring bar) helix TWTs are superior
   to monofilar helix TWTs for stability against BW oscillations due to a
   zero or at least greatly suppressed BW interaction impedance (K-BW)
   compared with the forward-wave (FW) interaction impedance (K-FW). We use
   3-D electromagnetic (EM) field calculations of a ring-bar helix to
   compare the BW and FW interaction impedances. Using a sine/cosine basis
   set and a comparison at a fixed phase velocity (rather than fixed
   frequency assumed in previous analyses), we show that the BW interaction
   impedance is not always significantly suppressed in the
   ring-bar/contrawound helix. In spite of the lack of ubiquitous BW
   stability, we use EM simulations to illustrate that there remain
   specific, efficient, high-gain mmw ring-bar designs with K-BW < K-FW.
   The accuracy of the simulations is validated by experimental
   measurements that confirm simulation predictions of phase velocity and
   S-parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Micro milling operation is a fabrication process to create 3D parts from
   tens of micrometers to a few millimeters in size using a tool with
   diameter less than 1mm. Micro groove is one of the common features
   observed in the micro parts. The surface roughness of micro grooves
   plays an important role in their performance. Since most of the
   finishing processes could not be easily performed on the micro grooves,
   it is of extreme importance to find a relationship between micro milling
   parameters and the surface roughness profile. In this paper, in order to
   anticipate the profile and surface roughness of the groove floor a model
   is proposed based on the kinematic of cutting process and tool geometry.
   The effects of minimum chip thickness, elastic recovery, size effect and
   tool deflection are included in the model. Relationship between position
   of points on the floor surface of groove and kinematics of cutting
   process are derived. In next step, simulations of proposed model are
   performed in the ACIS environment. Finally, using the DOE method surface
   roughness is investigated stochastically. The simulated and measured
   surface roughnesses are compared together that confirm the validity of
   proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral nanostructures exhibit strong coupling to the spin angular
   momentum of incident photons. The integration of metal nanostructures
   with semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) to form hybrid plasmonexciton
   nanoscale assemblies can potentially lead to plasmon-induced optical
   activity and unusual chiroptical properties of plasmonexciton states.
   Here we investigate such effects in supraparticles (SPs) spontaneously
   formed from gold nanorods (NRs) and chiral CdTe NPs. The geometry of
   this new type of self-limited nanoscale superstructures depends on the
   molar ratio between NRs and NPs. NR dimers surrounded by CdTe NPs were
   obtained for the ratio NR/NP = 1:15, whereas increasing the NP content
   to a ratio of NR/NP = 1:180 leads to single NRs in a shell of NPs. The
   SPs based on NR dimers exhibit strong optical rotatory activity
   associated in large part with their twisted scissor-like geometry. The
   preference for a specific nanoscale enantiomer is attributed to the
   chiral interactions between CdTe NP in the shell. The SPs based on
   single NRs also yield surprising chiroptical activity at the frequency
   of the longitudinal mode of NRs. Numerical simulations reveal that the
   origin of this chiroptical band is the cross talk between the
   longitudinal and the transverse plasmon modes, which makes both of them
   coupled with the NP excitonic state. The chiral SP NRNP assemblies
   combine the optical properties of excitons and plasmons that are
   essential for chiral sensing, chiroptical memory, and chiral catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{It is common for a firm to make use of multiple suppliers of different
   delivery lead times, reliabilities, and costs. In this study, we are
   concerned with the joint pricing and inventory control problem for such
   a firm that has a quick-response supplier and a regular supplier that
   both suffer random disruptions, and faces price-sensitive random
   demands. We aim at characterizing the optimal ordering and pricing
   policies in each period over a planning horizon, and analyzing the
   impacts of supply source diversification. We show that, when both
   suppliers are unreliable, the optimal inventory policy in each period is
   a reorder point policy and the optimal price is decreasing in the
   starting inventory level in that period. In addition, we show that
   having supply source diversification or higher supplier reliability
   increases the firm's optimal profit and lowers the optimal selling
   price. We also demonstrate that, with the selling price as a decision, a
   supplier may receive even more orders from the firm after an additional
   supplier is introduced. For the special case where the quick-response
   supplier is perfectly reliable, we further show that the optimal
   inventory policy is of a base-stock type and the optimal pricing policy
   is a list-price policy with markdowns.}},
