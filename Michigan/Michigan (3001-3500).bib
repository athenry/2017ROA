Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel methodology for real-time nondestructive defect
   detection, particularly hydrogen-assisted porosity of an aluminum alloy
   welded using pulsed gas tungsten arc welding is presented based on the
   plasma spectroscopy signal of the welding arc. The emission lines of the
   hydrogen atom at 656.3 nm and argon atom at 641.63 nm were analyzed to
   extract multiple feature parameters, from which more sensitive features
   were then selected for monitoring by means of Fisher distance criteria.
   The threshold detection method based on the features selected from the
   spectrum was found to be feasible in detecting the welding defect, i.e.,
   porosity in real-time. Furthermore, the established predicting model
   based on SVM-CV also successfully identified defect of porosity from
   normal welding with high accuracy.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{785+}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Efforts to impart elasticity and multifunctionality in nanocomposites
   focus mainly on integrating polymeric(1,2) and nanoscale(3-5)
   components. Yet owing to the stochastic emergence and distribution of
   strain-concentrating defects and to the stiffening of nanoscale
   components at high strains, such composites often possess unpredictable
   strain-property relationships. Here, by taking inspiration from
   kirigami-the Japanese art of paper cutting-we show that a network of
   notches(6-8) made in rigid nanocomposite and other composite sheets by
   top-down patterning techniques prevents unpredictable local failure and
   increases the ultimate strain of the sheets from 4 to 370\%. We also
   show that the sheets' tensile behaviour can be accurately predicted
   through finite-element modelling. Moreover, in marked contrast to other
   stretchable conductors(3-5), the electrical conductance of the
   stretchable kirigami sheets is maintained over the entire strain regime,
   and we demonstrate their use to tune plasma-discharge phenomena. The
   unique properties of kirigami nanocomposites as plasma electrodes open
   up a wide range of novel technological solutions for stretchable
   electronics and optoelectronic devices, among other application
   possibilities.}},

Abstract = {{Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are reported to be the
   most common category of nonfatal occupational injuries that result in
   days away from work and are also a leading cause of temporary and
   permanent disability. One of the most effective approaches to preventing
   WMSDs is to evaluate ergonomics considerations early in the design and
   construction planning stage before the worker encounters the unsafe
   conditions. However, a lack of tools for identifying potential ergonomic
   risks in a proposed workplace design has led to difficulties in
   integrating safety and health into workplace design practice. In an
   effort to address this issue, this study explores a motion data-driven
   framework for ergonomic analysis that automates and visualizes the
   evaluation process in a virtual workplace. This is accomplished by
   coupling the ergonomic analysis with three-dimensional (3D) virtual
   visualization of the work environment. The proposed approach uses motion
   data from the 3D model of the jobsite to evaluate the risk factors that
   can produce excessive physical loads on the human body through a
   biomechanical analysis. A global risk assessment of musculoskeletal
   disorders is performed on worker motions first, and a biomechanical
   simulation is then used to further analyze unsafe motions by estimating
   internal loads on each selected body joint of the worker and redesigning
   the motion and workplace accordingly. As a case study, several tasks
   taking place in a construction prefabrication shop are modeled and
   analyzed to modify the workplace and ensure improved ergonomic safety.
   The results indicate that the proposed approach enables identification
   and minimization of awkward worker postures in the virtual model to
   mitigate ergonomic risk during workplace design. (C) 2015 American

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective. One of the main goals of brain-machine interface (BMI)
   research is to restore function to people with paralysis. Currently,
   multiple BMI design features are being investigated, based on various
   input modalities (externally applied and surgically implantable sensors)
   and output modalities (e.g. control of computer systems, prosthetic
   arms, and functional electrical stimulation systems). While these
   technologies may eventually provide some level of benefit, they each
   carry associated burdens for end-users. We sought to assess the
   attitudes of people with paralysis toward using various technologies to
   achieve particular benefits, given the burdens currently associated with
   the use of each system. Approach. We designed and distributed a
   technology survey to determine the level of benefit necessary for people
   with tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury to consider using different
   technologies, given the burdens currently associated with them. The
   survey queried user preferences for 8 BMI technologies including
   electroencephalography, electrocorticography, and intracortical
   microelectrode arrays, as well as a commercially available eye tracking
   system for comparison. Participants used a 5-point scale to rate their
   likelihood to adopt these technologies for 13 potential control
   capabilities. Main Results. Survey respondents were most likely to adopt
   BMI technology to restore some of their natural upper extremity
   function, including restoration of hand grasp and/or some degree of
   natural arm movement. High speed typing and control of a fast robot arm
   were also of interest to this population. Surgically implanted wireless
   technologies were twice as `likely' to be adopted as their wired
   equivalents. Significance. Assessing end-user preferences is an
   essential prerequisite to the design and implementation of any assistive
   technology. The results of this survey suggest that people with
   tetraplegia would adopt an unobtrusive, autonomous BMI system for both
   restoration of upper extremity function and control of external devices
   such as communication interfaces.}},

Title = {{Isolating gait-related movement artifacts in electroencephalography
   during human walking}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective. High-density electroencephelography (EEG) can provide an
   insight into human brain function during real-world activities with
   walking. Some recent studies have used EEG to characterize brain
   activity during walking, but the relative contributions of movement
   artifact and electrocortical activity have been difficult to quantify.
   We aimed to characterize movement artifact recorded by EEG electrodes at
   a range of walking speeds and to test the efficacy of artifact removal
   methods. We also quantified the similarity between movement artifact
   recorded by EEG electrodes and a head-mounted accelerometer. Approach.
   We used a novel experimental method to isolate and record movement
   artifact with EEG electrodes during walking. We blocked
   electrophysiological signals using a nonconductive layer (silicone swim
   cap) and simulated an electrically conductive scalp on top of the swim
   cap using a wig coated with conductive gel. We recorded motion artifact
   EEG data from nine young human subjects walking on a treadmill at speeds
   from 0.4 to 1.6 m s(-1). We then tested artifact removal methods
   including moving average and wavelet-based techniques. Main results.
   Movement artifact recorded with EEG electrodes varied considerably,
   across speed, subject, and electrode location. The movement artifact
   measured with EEG electrodes did not correlate well with head
   acceleration. All of the tested artifact removal methods attenuated
   low-frequency noise but did not completely remove movement artifact. The
   spectral power fluctuations in the movement artifact data resembled data
   from some previously published studies of EEG during walking.
   Significance. Our results suggest that EEG data recorded during walking
   likely contains substantial movement artifact that: cannot be explained
   by head accelerations; varies across speed, subject, and channel; and
   cannot be removed using traditional signal processing methods. Future
   studies should focus on more sophisticated methods for removal of EEG
   movement artifact to advance the field.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Single carbon fiber electrodes (d = 8.4 mu m) insulated with
   parylene-c and functionalized with PEDOT:pTS have been shown to record
   single unit activity but manual implantation of these devices with
   forceps can be difficult. Without an improvement in the insertion method
   any increase in the channel count by fabricating carbon fiber arrays
   would be impractical. In this study, we utilize a water soluble coating
   and structural backbones that allow us to create, implant, and record
   from fully functionalized arrays of carbon fibers with similar to 150 mu
   m pitch. Approach. Two approaches were tested for the insertion of
   carbon fiber arrays. The first method used a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
   coating that temporarily stiffened the fibers while leaving a small
   portion at the tip exposed. The small exposed portion (500 mu m-1 mm)
   readily penetrated the brain allowing for an insertion that did not
   require the handling of each fiber by forceps. The second method
   involved the fabrication of silicon support structures with individual
   shanks spaced 150 mu m apart. Each shank consisted of a small groove
   that held an individual carbon fiber. Main results. Our results showed
   that the PEG coating allowed for the chronic implantation of carbon
   fiber arrays in five rats with unit activity detected at 31 days
   post-implant. The silicon support structures recorded single unit
   activity in three acute rat surgeries. In one of those surgeries a
   stacked device with three layers of silicon support structures and
   carbon fibers was built and shown to readily insert into the brain with
   unit activity on select sites. Significance. From these studies we have
   found that carbon fibers spaced at similar to 150 mu m readily insert
   into the brain. This greatly increases the recording density of chronic
   neural probes and paves the way for even higher density devices that
   have a minimal scarring response.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives/HypothesisThe mechanical properties of normal auricular
   cartilage provide a benchmark against which to characterize changes in
   auricular structure/function due to genetic defects creating phenotypic
   abnormalities in collagen subtypes. Such properties also provide
   inputs/targets for auricular reconstruction scaffold design. Several
   studies report the biomechanical properties for septal, costal, and
   articular cartilage. However, analogous data for auricular cartilage are
   lacking. Therefore, our aim in this study was to characterize both
   whole-ear and auricular cartilage mechanics by mechanically testing
   specimens and fitting the results to nonlinear constitutive models.
   Study DesignMechanical testing of whole ears and auricular cartilage
   punch biopsies.
   MethodsWhole human cadaveric ear and auricular cartilage punch biopsies
   from both porcine and human cartilage were subjected to whole-ear
   helix-down compression and quasistatic unconfined compression tests.
   Common hyperelastic constitutive laws (widely used to characterize soft
   tissue mechanics) were evaluated for their ability to represent the
   stress-strain behavior of auricular cartilage.
   ResultsLoad displacement curves for whole ear testing exhibited
   compliant linear behavior until after significant displacement where
   nonlinear stiffening occurred. All five commonly used two-term
   hyperelastic soft tissue constitutive models successfully fit both human
   and porcine nonlinear elastic behavior (mean R-2 fit >0.95).
   ConclusionsAuricular cartilage exhibits nonlinear strain-stiffening
   elastic behavior that is similar to other soft tissues in the body. The
   whole ear exhibits compliant behavior with strain stiffening at high
   displacement. The constants from the hyperelastic model fits provide
   quantitative baselines for both human and porcine (a commonly used
   animal model for auricular tissue engineering) auricular mechanics.

Abstract = {{Given the increasing evidence of safe application of elevated
   temperature in other clinical contexts, we consider the potential for
   supplemental hyperthermia to augment the effects of vancomycin against
   staphylococci, a major source of postoperative and posttraumatic sepsis.
   Laboratory reference strains and libraries of clinical blood isolates of
   Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   aureus, both as planktonic cells and as established biofilms, were
   assessed for thermosensitivity and increased susceptibility to
   vancomycin in the setting of thermal treatment. In addition to viability
   measures, patterns of stress gene expression were assessed with
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and structural changes were
   measured using quantitative transmission electron microscopy. Laboratory
   strains of both species had reduced growth and biofilm viability at 45
   degrees C, a temperature commonly used in other domains such as adjuvant
   treatments of malignancy. Blood isolates of S. epidermidis were
   consistent in this regard as well, but significant between-isolate
   variability in thermosensitivity was seen in blood isolates of S.
   aureus. Expression profiling and ultrastructural measurements confirmed
   that elevated temperature was a substantial stressor with or without
   vancomycin treatment. Our findings suggest that temperature elevations
   shown to be tolerated in humans in other settings hold the potential to
   be used as an adjuvant to antibiotic therapy against staphylococcal
   biofilms.}},

   search}},
Journal = {{VLDB JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{493-518}},

Abstract = {{When users issue a query to a database, they have expectations about the
   results. If what they search for is unavailable in the database, the
   system will return an empty result or, worse, erroneous mismatch
   results. We call this problem the MisMatch problem. In this paper, we
   solve the MisMatch problem in the context of XML keyword search. Our
   solution is based on two novel concepts that we introduce: target node
   type and Distinguishability. Target Node Type represents the type of
   node a query result intends to match, and Distinguishability is used to
   measure the importance of the query keywords. Using these concepts, we
   develop a low-cost post-processing algorithm on the results of query
   evaluation to detect the MisMatch problem and generate helpful
   suggestions to users. Our approach has three noteworthy features: (1)
   for queries with the MisMatch problem, it generates the explanation,
   suggested queries and their sample results as the output to users,
   helping users judge whether the MisMatch problem is solved without
   reading all query results; (2) it is portable as it can work with any
   lowest common ancestor-based matching semantics (for XML data without ID
   references) or minimal Steiner tree-based matching semantics (for XML
   data with ID references) which return tree structures as results. It is
   orthogonal to the choice of result retrieval method adopted; (3) it is
   lightweight in the way that it occupies a very small proportion of the
   whole query evaluation time. Extensive experiments on three real
   datasets verify the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our
   approach. A search engine called XClear has been built and is available
   at <http://xclear.comp.nus.edu.sg.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring high-intensity turbulence with fast response pressure probe
   sensors has proved to be an effective and accurate technique;
   unfortunately, according to the available literature, most pressure
   probe research focuses primarily on high-velocity (>100 m/s)
   applications. Commercially available pressure probe sensor systems are
   available; however, most designs are intended for not only high-velocity
   flow but also for high bandwidth (similar to 10 kHz) and
   multidirectional applications, which drastically increase cost and
   complexity. Extremely limited options exist for those seeking a simple
   yet sensitive and accurate unidirectional turbulent flow measurement
   method; therefore, the intended purpose of this paper is to provide a
   means for future scientists and engineers to develop a pressure probe
   sensor tailored to their specific needs. Research presented in this
   paper focuses on the design and analysis of two high-sensitivity,
   low-cost pressure probes for invasive measurements in low-velocity (<20
   m/s) highly turbulent air flow. The pressure probe design, calibration
   techniques, and modeling are discussed and experimentally validated.}},

Abstract = {{Generic quantum-circuit simulation appears intractable for conventional
   computers and may be unnecessary because useful quantum circuits exhibit
   significant structure that can be exploited during simulation. For
   example, Gottesman and Knill identified an important subclass, called
   stabilizer circuits, which can be simulated efficiently using
   group-theory techniques and insights from quantum physics. Realistic
   circuits enriched with quantum error-correcting codes and fault-tolerant
   procedures are dominated by stabilizer subcircuits and contain a
   relatively small number of non-Clifford components. Therefore, we
   develop new data structures and algorithms that facilitate parallel
   simulation of such circuits. Stabilizer frames offer more compact
   storage than previous approaches but require more sophisticated
   bookkeeping. Our implementation, called Quipu, simulates certain quantum
   arithmetic circuits (e.g., reversible ripple-carry adders) in polynomial
   time and space for equal superpositions of n-qubits. On such instances,
   known linear-algebraic simulation techniques, such as the
   (state-of-the-art) BDD-based simulator QuIDDPro, take exponential time.
   We simulate quantum Fourier transform and quantum fault-tolerant
   circuits using Quipu, and the results demonstrate that our
   stabilizer-based technique empirically outperforms QuIDDPro in all
   cases. While previous high-performance, structure-aware simulations of
   quantum circuits were difficult to parallellize, we demonstrate that

Title = {{A review on spindle thermal error compensation in machine tools}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{20-38}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Thermal error caused by the thermal deformation is one of the most
   significant factors influencing the accuracy of the machine tool. Among
   all the heat sources which lead to the thermal distortions, the spindle
   is the main one. This paper presents an overview of the research about
   the compensation of the spindle thermal error. Thermal error
   compensation is considered as a more convenient, effective and
   cost-efficient way to reduce the thermal error compared with other
   thermal error control and reduction methods. Based on the analytical
   calculation, numerical analysis and experimental tests of the spindle
   thermal error, the thermal error models are established and then applied
   for implementing the thermal error compensation. Different kinds of
   methods adopted in testing, modeling and compensating are listed and
   discussed. In addition, because the thermal key points are vital to the
   temperature testing, thermal error modeling, and even influence the
   effectiveness of compensation, various approaches of selecting thermal
   key points are introduced as well. This paper aims to give a basic
   introduction of the whole process of the spindle thermal error
   compensation and presents a summary of methods applied on different
   topics of it. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The retina drives various non-image-forming photoresponses, including
   circadian photoentrainment and pupil constriction. Previous
   investigators showed that in humans, photic suppression of the
   clock-controlled hormone melatonin is most sensitive to 460-nm blue
   light, with a threshold of 12 log photons cm(-2) s(-1). This threshold
   is surprising because non-image-forming vision is mediated by
   intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, which receive
   rod-driven synaptic input and can respond to light levels as low as 7
   log photons cm(-2) s(-1). Using a protocol that enhances data precision,
   we have found the threshold for human melatonin suppression to be 10 log
   photons cm(-2) s(-1) at 460 nm. This finding has far-reaching
   implications since there is mounting evidence that nocturnal activation
   of the circadian system can be harmful.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on an algorithm for automatic, targetless, extrinsic
   calibration of a lidar and optical camera system based upon the
   maximization of mutual information between the sensor-measured surface
   intensities. The proposed method is completely data-driven and does not
   require any fiducial calibration targetsmaking in situ calibration easy.
   We calculate the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the estimated
   calibration parameter variance, and we show experimentally that the
   sample variance of the estimated parameters empirically approaches the
   CRLB when the amount of data used for calibration is sufficiently large.
   Furthermore, we compare the calibration results to independent
   ground-truth (where available) and observe that the mean error
   empirically approaches zero as the amount of data used for calibration
   is increased, thereby suggesting that the proposed estimator is a
   minimum variance unbiased estimate of the calibration parameters.
   Experimental results are presented for three different lidar-camera
   systems: (i) a three-dimensional (3D) lidar and omnidirectional camera,
   (ii) a 3D time-of-flight sensor and monocular camera, and (iii) a 2D
   lidar and monocular camera.}},

Abstract = {{This research is a comprehensive study on the correlations between the
   locomotion characteristics and the gait patterns of a metameric
   earthworm-like robot. The paper is divided into two parts: modeling and
   gait generation are the focuses of Part A; relationship among physical
   parameters, gait designs and dynamic behavior of the robot, as well as
   gait optimization and experimental verification are the core problems
   presented in Part B. The results of the research contribute to the
   design and control of earthworm-like robots.
   In the first part of the paper, inspired by earthworms' morphology
   structure and based on the idea of integrating actuator and anchor into
   an individual body segment, a general N-segment kinematic model of the
   earthworm-like robot is developed. Kinematics of a single segment and
   the locomotion mechanism of the whole robot are investigated. Then the
   gait generation is studied for a general case. Gait parameters and their
   constraints are identified, and a gait generation algorithm is put
   forward following the mechanism of retrograde peristalsis waves. After
   that, considering non-ideal anchors and non-ideal actuators, a dynamic
   model with anisotropic Coulomb dry friction is developed. Critical
   conditions for actuator-overload and anchor-slippage are derived,
   respectively. The constructed kinematic and dynamic models, the gait
   generation algorithm and the critical conditions obtained in this study
   provide a sound basis for earthworm-like robot design and the follow-up
   gait analysis presented in Part B.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular wall endothelial cells control several physiological processes

   for drug targeting. Vascular-targeted drug carriers (VTCs) offer

   This is perhaps due to complex interactions of VTCs with blood
   components, which dictate VTC transport and adhesion to endothelial
   cells. This review focuses on VTC interaction with blood as well as
   novel `bio-inspired' designs to mimic and exploit features of blood in
   VTC development. Advanced approaches for enhancing VTCs are discussed
   along with applications in regenerative medicine, an area of massive

Abstract = {{Transcatheter arterial embolization and chemoembolization are standard
   locoregional therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However,
   these can result in tumor hypoxia, thus promoting tumor angiogenesis.
   The anti-angiogenic agent sorafenib is hypothesized to improve outcomes;
   however, oral administration limits patient tolerance. Therefore, the
   purpose of this study was to fabricate poly(lactide-co-glycolide)
   microspheres for local sorafenib delivery to tumors during
   liver-directed embolotherapies. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) were
   co-encapsulated for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of microsphere
   delivery. Microspheres were fabricated using a double emulsion/solvent
   evaporation method and characterized for size, sorafenib and IONP
   content, and MRI properties. MRI was performed before and after
   intra-arterial microsphere infusions in a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model.
   The microspheres were 13 microns in diameter with 8.8\% and 0.89\% (w/w)
   sorafenib and IONP, respectively. 21\% and 28\% of the loaded sorafenib
   and IONP, respectively, released within 72 h. Rabbit VX2 studies
   demonstrated that sorafenib microspheres normalized VEGFR 2 activity and
   decreased microvessel density. Quantitative MRI enabled in vivo
   visualization of intra-hepatic microsphere distributions. These methods
   should avoid systemic toxicities, with MRI permitting follow-up
   confirmation of microsphere delivery to the targeted liver tumors. (C)

Abstract = {{Short-term fluctuations in arterial pressures arising from normal
   physiological function are buffered by a negative feedback system known
   as the arterial baroreflex. Initiated by altered biomechanical stretch
   in the vessel wall, the baroreflex coordinates a systemic response that
   alters heart rate, cardiac contractility and peripheral vessel
   vasoconstriction. In this work, a coupled 3D-0D formulation for the
   short-term pressure regulation of the systemic circulation is presented.
   Including the baroreflex feedback mechanisms, a patient-specific model
   of the large arteries is subjected to a simulated head up tilt test.
   Comparative simulations with and without baroreflex control highlight
   the critical role that the baroreflex has in regulating variations in

Abstract = {{This paper presents procedural guidelines for the construction of

   subject to kappa Pfaffian constraints, system states are partitioned
   into ``leafwise{''} and ``transverse,{''} based on the structure of the
   Pfaffian constraint matrix. A reference vector field F is defined as a
   function of the leafwise states only in a way that it is nonsingular
   everywhere except for a submanifold containing the origin. The induced
   decomposition of the configuration space, together with requiring the
   system vector field to be aligned with F, suggests choices for
   Lyapunov-like functions. The proposed approach recasts the original
   nonholonomic control problem as an output regulation problem, which
   although nontrivial, may admit solutions based on standard tools.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the gas-kinetic method (GKM) is enhanced with resistive
   and Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) effects. Known as MGKM (for
   MHD-GKM), this approach incorporates additional source terms to the
   momentum and energy conservation equations and solves the magnetic field
   induction equation. We establish a verification protocol involving
   numerical solutions to the one-dimensional (1D) shock tube problem and
   two-dimensional (2D) channel flows. The contributions of ideal,
   resistive, and Hall effects are examined in isolation and in combination
   against available analytical and computational results. We also simulate
   the evolution of a laminar MHD jet subject to an externally applied
   magnetic field. This configuration is of much importance in the field of
   plasma propulsion. Results support previous theoretical predictions of
   jet stretching due to magnetic field influence and azimuthal rotation
   due to the Hall effect. In summary, MGKM is established as a promising
   tool for investigating complex plasma flow phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{The dependence of grain orientation on stress-induced martensitic

   view of nominally 100 mu m x 100 mu m using a custom combination of
   scanning electron microscopy with distortion-corrected digital image
   correlation. It was found that similarly oriented grains do not
   necessarily transform similarly, in contrast to a common assumption in
   mean-field theories. Specifically, grains with similar orientation (as
   determined by the misorientation of the grain and specimen axes) showed
   variation in both the mean strain of the grain as well as the range
   (heterogeneity) of strain across the grain, as determined from surface
   measurements. Additionally, neither grain size nor degree of
   misorientation (of common crystal axes from the loading axis) affected
   the mean strain and strain range. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc.

Title = {{Effect of concurrent oxygen therapy on accuracy of forecasting imminent

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Episodic postoperative desaturation occurs predominantly from
   respiratory depression or airway obstruction. Monitor display of
   desaturation is typically delayed by over 30 s after these dynamic
   inciting events, due to perfusion delays, signal capture and averaging.
   Prediction of imminent critical desaturation could aid development of
   dynamic high-fidelity response systems that reduce or prevent the
   inciting event from occurring. Oxygen therapy is known to influence the
   depth and duration of desaturation epochs, thereby potentially
   influencing the accuracy of forecasting of desaturation. In this study,
   postoperative pulse oximetry data were retrospectively modeled using
   autoregressive methods to create prediction models for and imminent
   critical desaturation in the postoperative period. The accuracy of these
   models in predicting near future values was tested using root mean
   square error. The model accuracy for prediction of critical desaturation
   ( ) was evaluated using meta-analytical methods (sensitivity,
   specificity, likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratios and area under
   summary receiver operating characteristic curves). Between-study
   heterogeneity was used as a measure of reliability of the model across
   different patients and evaluated using the tau-squared statistic. Model
   performance was evaluated in patients who received postoperative oxygen
   supplementation and patients who did not receive oxygen. Our results
   show that model accuracy was high with root mean square errors between
   0.2 and 2.8 \%. Prediction accuracy as defined by area under the curve
   for critical desaturation events was observed to be greater in patients
   receiving oxygen in the 60-s horizon ( vs. ). This was likely related to
   the higher frequency of events in this group (median {[}IQR] ) than
   patients who were not treated with oxygen ( ; ). Model reliability was
   reflected by the homogeneity of the prediction models which were
   homogenous across both prediction horizons and oxygen treatment groups.
   In conclusion, we report the use of autoregressive models to predict and
   forecast imminent critical desaturation events in the postoperative
   period with high degree of accuracy. These models reliably predict
   critical desaturation in patients receiving supplemental oxygen therapy.
   While high-fidelity prophylactic interventions that could modify these
   inciting events are in development, our current study offers proof of
   concept that the afferent limb of such a system can be modeled with a
   high degree of accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological evolution upon intense energetic particle matter
   interactions is of fundamental importance for materials utilized in
   extreme radiation environment, and controlling surface morphology by
   radiation also provides a new pathway for exploring non-equilibrium
   process at surface. In this work, surface morphology and microstructural
   evolution upon low energy ion irradiation of 18Cr-ODS, a candidate
   structural material for cladding and first wall of future fission and
   fusion reactors, were investigated by in situ focused Ga+ ion
   beam/scanning electron microscopy and ex situ transmission electron
   microscopy. A surface roughening through pore formation, coalescence and
   eventually nanoneedle formation was induced on 18Cr-ODS steel surface.
   Cross-section microstructure analysis indicates that the formation of
   nanoneedle was not a result of grain recrystallization or chemical
   composition change. Pre-irradiated materials by He+ and Fe+ ions
   displays enhanced kinetics for surface morphological evolution and lower
   fluences of focused Ga+ are required for the nanoneedle formation. These
   results suggest that the surface roughening and morphological evolution
   of 18Cr-ODS under low energy ion irradiation is an interplay between a
   curvature-dependent sputtering and defect accumulation near the surface.

Abstract = {{Laminar natural convection heat transfer in a differentially heated
   square cavity with a thin porous fin attached to the hot wall is studied
   numerically under steady state condition. Various pertinent parameters
   were employed, such as the Rayleigh number, Darcy number, fin
   inclination angle, length and position of the fin. Three different fin
   lengths (L = 0.2, 0.35, and 0.5) and positions (S = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75)
   are considered. The inclination fin angle is varied between 30 degrees
   and 150 degrees. The left wall of the cavity, to which the fin is
   attached, is assumed uniformly heated while the right wall is kept at a
   lower temperature. In addition, the horizontal walls of the cavity were
   considered insulated. Furthermore, the governing transport equations
   within the porous media are treated according to the volume-average
   theory while the Navier-Stokes equations were employed to represent the
   transport phenomena in the rest of the cavity. Moreover, the governing
   equations are solved using a finite element formulation based on the
   Galerkin method of weighted residuals. The results of this investigation
   showed that the presence of a porous fin increases the average Nusselt
   number when compared with the differentially heated cavity for various
   lengths, positions, and inclination angle of the fin. To achieve optimum
   heat transfer, the present results suggests that the porous fin should
   be placed either close to the bottom surface or in the middle of the
   vertical hot surface and an angle of 90 degrees. Finally, a numerical
   correlation for the average Nusselt number was developed as a function
   of the employed range of the Rayleigh number, Darcy number, fin's length
   and position. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Predictions of Delamination Growth for Quasi-Static Loading of Composite
   Laminates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an exact, two-dimensional (2D) quasi-static elastic
   analysis of predelaminated composite panels subject to arbitrary
   transverse pressure loads. The piecewise linear spring model and the
   shear bridging model are, respectively, used to simulate the normal
   contact and shear frictional behavior between the interfaces of the
   existing delamination. This general contact model can be further reduced
   to the ``friction-free model{''} and the ``constrained model{''} by
   assigning extreme values to the spring stiffnesses. The analysis yields
   a closed-form solution for the 2D displacement and stress fields. To
   predict the delamination propagation, different propagation criteria as
   suggested in the literature are used. Calculated load-displacement
   responses and delamination threshold loads are in good agreement with
   existing experimental data. The results are further compared against
   simple fracture models and a model that uses a modified classical
   laminated plate theory for the predelaminated composite with fracture
   criteria, showing an overestimation of the delamination threshold loads.
   The 2D elasticity theory that is formulated can be used with confidence
   to study other multilayered structures with multiple delaminations and
   subject to arbitrary loading profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels have been used in regenerative medicine because they provide a
   three-dimensional environment similar to soft tissues, allow diffusion
   of nutrients, present critical biological signals, and degrade via
   endogenous enzymatic mechanisms. Herein, we developed in vitro system
   mimicking cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in secondary lymphoid
   organs (SLOs). Existing in vitro culture systems cannot accurately
   represent the complex interactions happening between T-cells and stromal
   cells in immune response. To model T-cell interaction in SLOs in vitro,
   we encapsulated stromal cells in fibrin, collagen, or fibrin-collagen
   hydrogels and studied how different mechanical and biological properties
   affect stromal network formation. Overall, fibrin supplemented with
   aprotinin was superior to collagen and fibrin-collagen in terms of
   network formation and promotion of T-cell penetration. After 8 days of
   culture, stromal networks formed through branching and joining with
   other adjacent cell populations. T-cells added to the newly formed
   stromal networks migrated and attached to stromal cells, similar to the
   T-cell zones of the lymph nodes in vivo. Our results suggest that the
   constructed three-dimensional lymphoid stromal network can mimic the in
   vivo environment and allow the modeling of T-cell interaction in SLOs.

Abstract = {{The structure of in-cylinder flow field makes significant impacts on the
   processes of fuel injection, air-fuel interactions, and flame
   development in internal combustion engines. In this study, the
   implementation of time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) in an
   optical engine is presented. Flow field PIV images at different crank
   angles have been taken using a high-speed double-pulsed laser and a
   high-speed camera with seeding particles mixed with the intake air. This
   study is focused on measuring the flow fields on the swirl plane at 30mm
   below the injector tip under various intake air swirl ratios. A simple
   algorithm is developed to identify the vortex structure and to track the
   location and motion of vortex center at different crank angles. Proper
   orthogonal decomposition (POD) has been used to extract the ensemble and
   variation information of the vortex structure. Experimental results
   reveal that strong cycle-to-cycle variations exist in almost all test
   conditions. The vortex center is difficult to identify since multiple,
   but small scale, vortices exist during the early stage of the intake
   stroke. However, during the compression stroke when only one vortex
   center exists in most cycles, the motion of vortex center is found to be
   quite similar at different intake swirl ratios and engine speeds. This
   is due to the dominant driving force exerted by the piston's upward
   motion on the in-cylinder air.}},

Abstract = {{Algae is generally regarded as the only source of renewable biodiesel
   that is capable of meeting the global demand for transport fuels.
   Hydrothermal liquefaction is the method of dissolving organic compounds
   in subcritical water at high ion product, which can accelerate the
   acid-catalyzed and hydrolytic decomposition of algal macromolecules.
   This promising process converts different algal strains with high
   moisture content to high bio-oil yields with lower coke and lower energy
   consumption in comparison to other methods. The properties of the
   resulting bio-oil are clearly affected by parameters such as
   temperature, reaction time, algae species, algae concentration, reaction
   atmosphere, and catalysts, in subcritical water reaction conditions.
   This paper will provide an extensive review of the updated results on
   the hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae. Including summary on the
   conversion of major compounds in microalgae and products related to the
   process and the influences of reaction conditions, catalysts and
   hydrotreating with comparing the variation tendencies and main results

Pages = {{10-18}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The interaction between a salt solution and ice formation in capillary
   pores might provide new insight into the salt frost scaling process. To
   accomplish this small prismatic specimens (10 mm x 10 mm x 90 mm) were
   cut from air-entrained concrete, dried at 50 degrees C until constant
   weight, then immersed in sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions of different
   concentrations (0\%, 3\%, 9\% and 12\%) until they reached full
   capillary saturation. They were then subjected to a freeze-thaw (F-T)
   cycle in a high resolution low temperature dilatometer (LTD) with the
   surface temperature and uniaxial length-change continuously monitored.
   Internal saturation of capillary pores with increasing salt solutions is
   found to have a profound effect on the F-T response including the
   temperature rise and instant dilation associated with ice nucleation. It
   is concluded that salt ions retard ice formation and the effect of
   ice-growth on pore expansion during an F-T cycle. The presence of salt
   ions in the concrete pores and surface liquid has a counter-balancing
   effect on specimen length-change associated with ice-growth, which may
   provide one possible explanation for the pessimum salt concentration
   effect. The extent of surface scaling is also affected by the intrinsic
   capillary transport property (i.e., sorptivity) of the porous
   cementitious binder. Salt scaling is exacerbated in concretes with
   increasing sorptivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneously targeted imaging cytoplasm and nucleus in living cell by
   just one photoluminescent nanocrystals has been a giant challenge in
   nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine. Herein we report a novel Arg-Gly-Asp
   peptide (RGD) or cysteine (Cys) functionalized ultra-small GdOF
   nanocrystals for simultaneously targeted imaging cell cytoplasm and
   nucleus. As-prepared RGD@GdOF and Cys@GdOF nanocrystals possessed high
   water dispersibility, ultra-small size (about 5 nm) and double emissions
   (545 nm and 587 nm) with high quantum yield. Such functionalized
   nanocrystals presented high cellular biocompatibility and were
   successfully used to label living cells with very high signal to noise
   ratio. The living cells cytoplasm and nucleus (cancer cells and stem
   cells) could be imaged simultaneously through the mergence of green and
   red emission of nanocrystals, based on mechanism of fluorescent
   intensity difference. These functionalized nanocrystals also exhibited
   significantly higher photostability and brightness as compared to dyes.
   Such the ultra-small size, high photostability and intensity, double
   emissions, excellent biocompatibility and targeted ability, make
   as-prepared functionalized nanocrystals particularly promising for

Abstract = {{An experimentally verified finite element model was used to estimate the

   the grain refinement. A linear relation of the form In d = a x In Z + b
   was determined relating the average grain size (d) to the Z-parameter
   with a and b being equal to -0.23 and 8.79, respectively. These
   coefficients differed from values reported by others for AZ31 magnesium
   alloy with this difference being attributed to different material
   processing techniques used in the as-received condition. The resulting
   equation can be used in controlling the grain size during friction stir
   processing by varying the process parameters (spindle speed and tool
   feed) that would in turn affect the instantaneous value of the
   Zener-Hollomon parameter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Generation 5 (G5) poly(amidoamide) (PAMAM) dendrimers are synthetic
   polymers that have been broadly applied as drug delivery carriers.
   Methotrexate (MTX), an anti-folate metabolite, has been successfully
   used as an anti-inflammatory drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in
   the clinic. In this study, we examine the therapeutic efficacy of G5
   PAMAM dendrimer methotrexate conjugates (G5-MTX) that also have folic
   acid (FA) conjugated to the G5-MTX (G5-FA-MTX) to target
   inflammation-activated folate receptors overexpressing macrophages.
   These cells are thought to play an important role in the development of
   RA. With G5 serving as a control, the in vitro binding affinities of
   G5-FA-MTX and G5-MTX to activated macrophages were assessed in RAW264.7,
   NR8383 and primary rat peritoneal macrophages. The results indicated
   that the binding of either conjugate to macrophages was concentration-
   and temperature-dependent and could be blocked by the presence of 6.25
   mM free FA (p < 0.005). The preventive effects of G5-MTX and G5-FA-MTX
   conjugates on the development of arthritis were explored on an
   adjuvant-induced inflammatory arthritis model and had similar preventive
   effects in inflammatory arthritis at a MIX equivalent dose of 4.95 mu
   mol/kg. These studies indicated that when multiples of MTX are
   conjugated on dendritic polymers, they specifically bind to folate
   receptor overexpressing macrophages and have comparable
   anti-inflammatory effects to folate targeted MTX conjugated polymers.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to fabricate bone-like apatite (BLAp)
   powder using the modified simulated body fluid (SBF). The SBF2X and
   SBF4X groups were prepared by increasing the concentration of inorganic
   ions by two and four times, respectively, to that of the standard SBF.
   The mSBF4X group was prepared by particularly increasing the
   concentrations of calcium and phosphate ions in SBF. Bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) was added for SBF2X-BSA, SBF4X-BSA, and mSBF4X-BSA groups.
   BLAp powders were precipitated in these SBFs while being kept at 60
   degrees C. Micro-morphology of BLAp powders showed tens of
   micrometers-sized rounded clusters which composed with sheet-like nano
   crystallites. The radius of BLAp clusters were decreased by increasing
   the concentration of inorganic ions and by incorporating the BSA. The
   hydroxyapatite crystalline structure was dominant for all sample groups.
   Further, octacalciunn phosphate structure was detected in the mSBF4X
   group. However, these peaks were decreased in nnSBF4X-BSA. FT-IR spectra
   demonstrated that BSA was co-precipitated in BLAp crystallites, and the
   amount of BSA was higher in the mSBF4X-BSA group than in the SBF4X-BSA
   group.}},

Title = {{First-principles calculations of indirect Auger recombination in nitride
   semiconductors}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Auger recombination is an important nonradiative carrier recombination
   mechanism in many classes of optoelectronic devices. The microscopic
   Auger processes can be either direct or indirect, mediated by an
   additional scattering mechanism such as the electron-phonon interaction
   and alloy disorder scattering. Indirect Auger recombination is
   particularly strong in nitride materials and affects the efficiency of
   nitride optoelectronic devices at high powers. Here, we present a
   first-principles computational formalism for the study of direct and
   indirect Auger recombination in direct-band-gap semiconductors and apply
   it to the case of nitride materials. We show that direct Auger
   recombination is weak in the nitrides and cannot account for
   experimental measurements. On the other hand, carrier scattering by
   phonons and alloy disorder enables indirect Auger processes that can
   explain the observed loss in devices. We analyze the dominant phonon
   contributions to the Auger recombination rate and the influence of
   temperature and strain on the values of the Auger coefficients. Auger
   processes assisted by charged-defect scattering are much weaker than the
   phonon-assisted ones for realistic defect densities and not important
   for the device performance. The computational formalism is general and
   can be applied to the calculation of the Auger coefficient in other
   classes of optoelectronic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant replacement therapy (SRT) involves instillation of a
   liquid-surfactant mixture directly into the lung airway tree. It is
   widely successful for treating surfactant deficiency in premature
   neonates who develop neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS).
   However, when applied to adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome
   (ARDS), early successes were followed by failures. This unexpected and
   puzzling situation is a vexing issue in the pulmonary community. A
   pressing question is whether the instilled surfactant mixture actually
   reaches the adult alveoli/acinus in therapeutic amounts. In this study,
   to our knowledge, we present the first mathematical model of SRT in a 3D
   lung structure to provide insight into answering this and other
   questions. The delivery is computed from fluid mechanical principals for
   3D models of the lung airway tree for neonates and adults. A liquid plug
   propagates through the tree from forced inspiration. In two separate
   modeling steps, the plug deposits a coating film on the airway wall and
   then splits unevenly at the bifurcation due to gravity. The model
   generates 3D images of the resulting acinar distribution and calculates
   two global indexes, efficiency and homogeneity. Simulating published
   procedural methods, we show the neonatal lung is a well-mixed
   compartment, whereas the adult lung is not. The earlier, successful
   adult SRT studies show comparatively good index values implying adequate
   delivery. The later, failed studies used different protocols resulting
   in very low values of both indexes, consistent with inadequate acinar
   delivery. Reasons for these differences and the evolution of failure
   from success are outlined and potential remedies discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Supramolecular chemistry utilizes coordination bonds to assemble
   molecular building blocks into a variety of sophisticated constructs.
   However, traditional coordination assemblies are based on organic
   compounds that have limited ability to transport charge. Herein, we
   describe coordination assembly of anisotropic FeS2 pyrite nanoparticles
   (NPs) that can facilitate charge transport. Zn2+ ions form
   supramolecular complexes with carboxylate end-groups on NP surface,
   leading to multiparticle sheets with liquid-crystal-like organization.
   Conductivity and Hall carrier mobility of the p-type layered
   semiconductor films with Zn2+ coordination bridging exceed those known
   for coordination compounds, some by several orders of magnitude. The
   nanoscale porosity of the assembled sheets combined with fast hole
   transport leads to high electrocatalytic activity of the NP films. The
   coordination assembly of NPs embraces the versatility of several types
   of building blocks and opens a new design space for self-organized
   materials combining nanoscale and supramolecular structural motifs.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disease. Accurate
   detection of AD and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI), are crucial. There is also a growing interest in identifying
   brain imaging biomarkers that help to automatically differentiate stages
   of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we focused on brain structural networks
   computed from diffusion MRI and proposed a new feature extraction and
   classification framework based on higher order singular value
   decomposition and sparse logistic regression. In tests on publicly
   available data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, our
   proposed framework showed promise in detecting brain network differences
   that help in classifying different stages of Alzheimer's disease.}},

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires have recently been
   utilized as an interphase to increase the interfacial strength of carbon
   fiber Composites. It was shown that the interaction between the carbon
   fiber and the ZnO nanowires was a critical parameter in adhesion;
   however, fiber based testing techniques are dominated by local defects
   and cannot be used to effectively study the bonding interaction
   directly. Here, the strength of the interface between ZnO and graphitic
   carbon is directly measured with atomic force microscopy (AFM) using
   oxygen plasma treated highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and an
   AFM tip coated with ZnO nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   analysis is used to compare the surface chemistry of HOPG and carbon
   fiber and to quantify the presence of various oxygen functional groups.
   An indirect measurement of the interfacial strength is then performed
   through single fiber fragmentation testing (SFF) on functionalized
   carbon fibers coated with ZnO nanowires to validate the AFM
   measurements. The SFF and AFM methods showed the same correlation,
   demonstrating the capacity Of the AFM method to study the interfacial
   properties in composite materials. Additionally, the chemical
   interactions between oxygen functional groups and the ionic structure of
   ZnO suggest that intermolecular forces at the interface are responsible
   for the strong interface.}},

Abstract = {{We present new experimental results from a radiation portal monitor
   based on the use of organic liquid scintillators. The system was tested
   as part of a He-3-free radiation portal monitor testing campaign at the
   European Commission's joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy, in February
   2014. The radiation portal monitor was subjected to a wide range of test
   conditions described in ANSI N42.35, including a variety of gamma ray
   sources and a 20,000 n/s Cf-252 source. A false alarm test tested
   whether radiation portal monitors ever alarmed in the presence of only
   natural background. The University of Michigan Detection for Nuclear
   Nonproliferation Group's system triggered zero false alarms in 2739
   trials. It consistently alarmed on a variety of gamma ray sources
   travelling at 1.2 m/s at a 70 cm source to detector distance. The
   neutron source was detected at speeds up to 3 m/s and in configurations
   with up to 8 cm of high density polyethylene shielding. The success of
   on radionuclide identification varied with the gamma ray source measured
   as well as with which of two radionuclide identification methods was
   used. Both methods used a least squares comparison between the measured
   pulse height distributions to library spectra to pick the best match.
   The methods varied in how the pulse height distributions were modified
   prior to the least squares comparison. Correct identification rates were
   as high as 100\% for highly enriched uranium, but as low as 50\% for
   Am-241. Both radionuclide identification algorithms produced mixed
   results, but the concept of using liquid scintillation detectors for
   gamma ray and neutron alarming in radiation portal monitor was
   validated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate semitransparent small molecule organic photovoltaic (OPV)

   series resistance, whereas the internal quantum efficiency increases
   from an average of 75\% to 85\% between the wavelengths of lambda = 450
   nm and 550 nm. The inverted, semitransparent PM-HJ cell achieves a power
   conversion efficiency of PCE = 3.9\% +/- 0.2\% under simulated AM1.5G
   illumination at one sun intensity with an average optical transmission
   of (T) over bar = 51\% +/- 2\% across the visible spectrum,
   corresponding to > 10\% improvement compared with the mixed HJ cell. We
   also demonstrate an inverted semitransparent tandem cell incorporating
   two PM-HJ sub-cells with different absorption spectra. The tandem cell
   achieves a PCE = 5.3\% +/- 0.3\% under simulated AM1.5G at one sun

Abstract = {{The field of artificial intelligence (AI) strives to build rational
   agents capable of perceiving the world around them and taking actions to

   construct a synthetic homo economicus, the mythical perfectly rational
   agent of neoclassical economics. We review progress toward creating this
   new species of machine, machina economicus, and discuss some challenges
   in designing AIs that can reason effectively in economic contexts.
   Supposing that AI succeeds in this quest, or at least comes close enough
   that it is useful to think about AIs in rationalistic terms, we ask how
   to design the rules of interaction in multi-agent systems that come to
   represent an economy of AIs. Theories of normative design from economics
   may prove more relevant for artificial agents than human agents, with
   AIs that better respect idealized assumptions of rationality than
   people, interacting through novel rules and incentive systems quite
   distinct from those tailored for people.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical structure and bond location are well-known to impact combustion
   reactivity. The current work presents new experimental autoignition and
   speciation data on the three trans-hexene isomers (1-hexene,
   trans-2-hexene, and trans-3-hexene), which describe the effects of the
   location of the carbon carbon double bond. Experiments were conducted
   with the University of Michigan rapid compression facility to determine
   ignition delay times from pressure time histories. Stoichiometric (phi =
   1.0) mixtures at dilution levels of buffer gas:O-2 = 7.5 (mole basis)
   were investigated at an average pressure of 11 atm and temperatures from
   837 to 1086 K. Fast gas sampling and gas chromatography were also used
   to quantitatively measure 13 stable intermediate species formed during
   the ignition delay period of each isomer at a temperature of similar to
   900 K. The measured ignition delay times and species measurements were
   in good agreement with previous experimental studies at overlapping
   conditions. The results were modeled using a gasoline surrogate reaction
   mechanism from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which contains a
   submechanism for the trans-hexene isomers. The model predictions
   captured the overall autoignition characteristics of the hexene isomers
   well (within a factor of 2), as well as the time histories of several of
   the intermediate species (e.g., propene). However, there were
   discrepancies between the model predictions and the experimental data
   for some species, particularly for the 3-hexene isomer.}},

Abstract = {{Humans can perform motor tasks in a variety of ways, yet often favor a
   particular strategy. Some factors governing the preferred strategy may
   be objective and quantifiable, (e.g. metabolic energy or mechanical
   work) while others may be more subjective and less measurable, (e.g.
   discomfort, pain, or mental effort). Subjectivity can make it
   challenging to explain or predict preferred movement strategies. We
   propose that subjective factors might nevertheless be characterized
   indirectly by their trade-offs against more objective measures such as
   work. Here we investigated whether subjective costs that influence human
   movement during drop landings could be indirectly assessed by
   quantifying mechanical work performed. When landing on rigid ground,
   humans typically absorb much of the collision actively by bending their
   knees, perhaps to avoid the discomfort of stiff-legged landings. We
   measured how work performed by healthy adults (N=8) changed as a
   function of surface cushioning for drop landings (fixed at about 0.4 m)
   onto varying amounts of foam. Landing on more foam dissipated more
   energy passively in the surface, thus reducing the net dissipation
   required of subjects, due to relatively fixed landing energy. However,
   subjects actually performed even less work in the dissipative collision,
   as well as in the subsequent active, positive work to return to upright
   stance (approximately linear decrease of about 1.52 J per 1 cm of foam
   thickness). As foam thickness increased, there was also a corresponding
   reduction in center-of-mass vertical displacement after initial impact
   by up to 43\%. Humans appear to subjectively value cushioning, revealed
   by the extra work they perform landing without it. Cushioning is thus
   worth more than the energy it dissipates, in an amount that indicates
   the subjective discomfort of stiff landings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The photophysics of {[}o-4-RStyrPhSiO(1.5)](8) {[}R = Me, OMe, NBoc, and
   CN] was reported previously. Here we report studies on
   {[}o-4-RStyrPhSiO(1.5)](10,12),
   {[}o-4-RStyrPhSiO(1.5)](3-){[}PhSiO1.5](7), and
   {[}o-4-RStyrPhSiO(1.5)](6){[}PhSiO1.5](6) to explore cage size,
   geometry, and partial substitution effects on photophysical properties.
   All compounds were characterized by traditional methods including
   solution spectroscpy and two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections and
   except R = NBoc offer T-d5\% >= 400 degrees C/air. All exhibit
   absorption and emission spectra similar to the T-8 cages but with some
   important differences in TPA cross sections. The R-stilbenes appear to
   interact in the excited state through the cage, exhibiting emission
   spectra red-shifted from the parent stilbenes. TPA studies show novel
   behavior that is functional group, geometry, and substitution number
   dependent. Thus, NBoc TPA cross sections/moiety increase, with
   decreasing numbers of functional groups from 8 to 3 for PhT10 and 10 to
   6 for PhT12 where {[}NBocStyrPhSiO(1.5)](8) TPA/moiety approximate to 0.
   In contrast, CN cages offer TPA/moiety values slightly greater on going
   from 3 to 8 (PhT10) and 6 to 10 (PhT12). NBoc TPA data are best
   explained if bromination occurs asymmetrically, leading to asymmetric
   functionalization and exceptional polarization in partially substituted
   cages as symmetrically substituted cages exhibit opposing polarizations.
   In sum, all the individual induced transition dipoles on excitation
   mutually cancel. In contrast, both the cage and CN are strongly electron
   withdrawing such that no significant polarization is observed/expected
   when asymmetrically functionalized. Both NBoC and CN substituents offer
   red shifts greater than Me and MeO T-10,T-12, suggesting extended
   conjugation without polarization. Asymmetric bromination is supported by
   DFT modeling studies where initial o-Br/o-H bonding stabilizes incoming
   Br-2 by 300 mEv.}},

Abstract = {{Redox flow batteries (RFBs) hold promise for use in large-scale energy
   storage applications, but new electrolyte chemistries are needed to
   significantly enhance their energy densities and lower their cost. The
   energy density is governed by the cell voltage, active species
   concentration, and number of electrons transferred at each electrode.
   Nonaqueous solvents offer wider voltage windows than water; however,
   most if not all of the previously reported active species have low
   solubilities and/or are limited to single electron transfer at each
   electrode. In this paper we describe the design, synthesis, and
   characterization of metal coordination complexes containing noninnocent
   ligands that demonstrate enhanced solubilities at different oxidation
   states along with multiple electron transfers. In particular, a series
   of ester-functionalized chromium bipyridine complexes are demonstrated
   that afford six reversible redox couples over similar to 2 V and
   solubilities approaching 1 M. These characteristics allow the same
   complex to be used at the negative and positive electrodes. Using an
   electrolyte consisting of the
   tris(4,4'-(bis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)-ethyl)ester)-2,2'-bipyridine)chromium
   complex ({[}Cr(L3)(3)]) in acetonitrile, we demonstrate two reversible
   electron transfers at each electrode in an unoptimized, symmetric H-cell
   with efficiencies of similar to 70\%. With further enhancements in the
   electrolyte chemistry and cell design, this approach could lead to the
   demonstration of highly energy dense RFB chemistries for grid-scale
   storage applications.}},

Abstract = {{Set-point attitude control of a rigid body explicitly preventing
   actuator saturation is considered. The attitude control approach
   developed does not employ any sort of direction-cosine-matrix (DCM)
   parameterisation, such as Euler angles or quaternions. Rather, the DCM
   is used directly within the feedback control algorithm. Together a
   proportional control term and an angular velocity control term make up
   the attitude controller. The angular velocity control is composed of a
   strictly positive real system subject to a special input non-linearity.
   The specific form of the proportional control and angular velocity
   control ensure control torques are below the saturation level of the
   on-board actuators. Two controller synthesis methods are considered. The
   first uses the linearised system, the solution to the linear quadratic
   regulator problem, and the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma to design the
   controller. The second employs a simple low-pass filter that is
   guaranteed to stabilise the closed-loop system; tuning the low-pass
   filter is also considered. Numerical simulation results demonstrate
   effective closed-loop control in the presence of plant disturbances and
   sensor noise.}},

Abstract = {{Memristors have attracted broad interest as a promising candidate for
   future memory and computing applications. Particularly, it is believed
   that memristors can effectively implement synaptic functions and enable
   efficient neuromorphic systems. Most previous studies, however, focus on
   implementing specific synaptic learning rules by carefully engineering
   external programming parameters instead of focusing on emulating the
   internal cause that leads to the apparent learning rules. Here, it is
   shown that by taking advantage of the different time scales of internal
   oxygen vacancy (V-O) dynamics in an oxide-based memristor, diverse
   synaptic functions at different time scales can be implemented
   naturally. Mathematically, the device can be effectively modeled as a
   second-order memristor with a simple set of equations including multiple
   state variables. Not only is this approach more biorealistic and easier
   to implement, by focusing on the fundamental driving mechanisms it
   allows the development of complete theoretical and experimental
   frameworks for biologically inspired computing systems.}},

   oxide (GO) or reduced GO (rGO) as the starting materials, which take
   hours to days for fabrication. Here, an unexpected discovery that GO
   with or without holes can be controllably, directly, and rapidly (tens
   of seconds) fabricated from graphite powder via a one-step-one-pot
   microwave assisted reaction with a production yield of 120 wt\% of
   graphite is reported. Furthermore, a fast and low temperature approach
   is developed for simultaneous nitrogen (N) doping and reduction of GO
   sheets. The N-doped holey rGO sheets demonstrate remarkable
   electrocatalytic capabilities for the electrochemical oxygen reduction
   reaction. The existence of the nanoholes provides a short cut for
   efficient mass transport and dramatically increases edges and surface
   area, therefore, creates more catalytic centers. The capability of rapid
   fabrication and N-doping as well as reduction of holey GO can lead to
   development of an efficient catalyst that can replace previous coin
   metals for energy generation and storage, such as fuel cells and
   metal-air batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel-base alloys display exceptional mechanical properties to high
   fractions of their melting point due to the presence of L1(2) gamma'
   precipitates. However, above 1000 degrees C, the precipitates typically
   coarsen or rapidly undergo shape changes along with dissolution into the
   matrix, thereby degrading the mechanical performance of the alloy at
   higher temperatures. In this research, a Pt-modified Ni-base alloy with
   exceptional high temperature stability has been identified. Coarsening
   studies conducted in the temperature range from 1050-1200 degrees C
   reveal unusually high volume fractions of morphologically stable gamma'
   precipitates up to 1200 degrees C. Electron-probe micro-analysis
   demonstrates strong partitioning of Pt to the gamma' phase. The presence
   of a high volume fraction of slowly coarsening precipitates at 1200
   degrees C suggests that the alloy would have excellent performance as a
   bond coat and/or single crystal blade. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Dense nanoparticles exhibit enhanced vascular wall targeting over
   neutrally buoyant nanoparticles in human blood flow}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Pages = {{99-108}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{For vascular-targeting carrier (VTC) systems to be effective, carriers
   must be able to localize and adhere to the vascular wall at the target
   site. Research suggests that neutrally buoyant nanoparticles are limited
   by their inability to localize to the endothelium, making them
   sub-optimal as carriers. This study examines whether particle density
   can be exploited to improve the targeting (localization and adhesion)
   efficiency of nanospheres to the vasculature. Silica spheres with 500 nm
   diameter, which have a density roughly twice that of blood, exhibit
   improved adhesion to inflamed endothelium in an in vitro model of human
   vasculature compared to neutrally buoyant polystyrene spheres of the
   same size. Silica spheres also display better near-wall localization in
   the presence of red blood cells than they do in pure buffer, likely
   resulting in the observed improvement in adhesion. Titania spheres (4
   times more dense than blood) adhere at levels higher than polystyrene,
   but only in conditions when gravity or centrifugal force acts in the
   direction of adhesion. In light of the wide array of materials proposed
   for use as carrier systems for drug delivery and diagnostics, particle
   density may be a useful tool for improving the targeting of diseased
   tissues. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Hypercellularity Components of Glioblastoma Identified by High b-Value
   Diffusion-Weighted Imaging}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Use of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for target
   definition may expose glioblastomas (GB) to inadequate radiation dose
   coverage of the nonenhanced hypercellular subvolume. This study aimed to
   develop a technique to identify the hypercellular components of GB by
   using high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and to investigate
   its relationship with the prescribed 95\% isodose volume (PDV) and
   progression-free survival (PFS).
   Methods and Materials: Twenty-one patients with GB underwent
   chemoradiation therapy post-resection and biopsy. Radiation therapy (RT)
   treatment planning was based upon conventional MRI. Pre-RT DWIs were
   acquired in 3 orthogonal directions with b-values of 0, 1000, and 3000
   s/mm(2). Hypercellularity volume (HCV) was defined on the high b-value
   (3000 s/mm(2)) DWI by a threshold method. Nonenhanced signified regions
   not covered by the Gd-enhanced gross tumor volume (GTV-Gd) on
   T1-weighted images. The PDV was used to evaluate spatial coverage of the
   HCV by the dose plan. Association between HCV and PFS or other clinical
   covariates were assessed using univariate proportional hazards
   regression models.
   Results: HCVs and nonenhanced HCVs varied from 0.58 to 67 cm(3) (median:
   9.8 cm(3)) and 0.15 to 60 cm3 (median: 2.5 cm(3)), respectively.
   Fourteen patients had incomplete dose coverage of the HCV, 6 of whom had
   > 1 cm(3) HCV missed by the 95\% PDV (range: 1.01-25.4 cm(3)). Of the 15
   patients who progressed, 5 progressed earlier, within 6 months post-RT,
   and 10 patients afterward. Pre-RT HCVs within recurrent GTVs-Gd were
   78\% (range: 65\%-89\%) for the 5 earliest progressions but lower, 53\%
   (range: 0\%-85\%), for the later progressions. HCV and nonenhanced HCV
   were significant negative prognostic indicators for PFS (P<.002 and
   P<.01, respectively). The hypercellularity subvolume not covered by the
   95\% PDV was a significant negative predictor for PFS (P<.05).
   Conclusions: High b-value DWI identifies the hypercellular components of
   GB and could aid in RT target volume definition. Future studies will
   allow us to investigate the role of high b-value DWI in identifying
   radiation boost volumes and diagnosing progression. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Charging procedures at low temperatures severely shorten the cycle life
   of lithium ion batteries due to lithium deposition on the negative
   electrode. In this paper, cycle life tests are conducted to reveal the
   influence of the charging current rate and the cut-off voltage limit on
   the aging mechanisms of a large format LiFePO4 battery at a low
   temperature (-10 degrees C). The capacity degradation rates accelerate
   rapidly after the charging current reaches 0.25 C or the cut-off voltage
   reaches 3.55 V. Therefore the scheduled current and voltage during
   low-temperature charging should be reconsidered to avoid capacity
   degradation. Lithium deposition contributes to low-temperature aging
   mechanisms, as something needle-like which might be deposited lithium is
   observed on the surface of the negative electrode after disassembling
   the aged battery cell. To confirm our explanation, incremental capacity
   analysis (ICA) is performed to identify the characteristics of the
   lithium deposition induced battery aging mechanisms. Furthermore, the
   aging mechanism is quantified using a mechanistic model, whose
   parameters are estimated with the particle swarm optimization algorithm
   (PSO). The loss of reversible lithium originating from secondary SEI
   formation and dead lithium is confirmed as the cause of the aging. (C)

Abstract = {{The ability to synthesize semiconductor nanowires with deterministic and
   tunable control of orientation and morphology on a wide range of
   substrates, while high precision and repeatability are maintained, is a
   challenge currently faced for the development of many nanoscale material
   systems. Here we show that atomic layer deposition (ALD) presents a
   reliable method of surface and interfacial modification to guide
   nanowire orientation on a variety of substrate materials and geometries,
   including high-aspect-ratio, three-dimensional templates. We demonstrate
   control of the orientation and geometric properties of hydrothermally
   grown single crystalline ZnO nanowires via the deposition of a ZnO seed
   layer by ALD. The crystallographic texture and roughness of the seed
   layer result in tunable preferred nanowire orientations and densities
   for identical hydrothermal growth conditions. The structural and
   chemical relationship between the ALD layers and nanowires was
   investigated with synchrotron X-ray diffraction, high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of orientation and morphology
   control. The resulting control parameters were utilized to produce
   hierarchical nanostructures with tunable properties on a wide range of
   substrates, including vertical micropillars, paper fibers, porous
   polymer membranes, and biological substrates. This illustrates the power
   of AID for interfacial engineering of heterogeneous material systems at
   the nanoscale, to provide a highly controlled and scalable seeding
   method for bottom-up synthesis of integrated nanosystems.}},

Abstract = {{We simulate poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) oligomers and model Tween 80
   (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate) molecules at water/alkane
   interfaces. Using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM),
   including an extension of WHAM to two reaction coordinates to remove
   hysteresis, we calculate interfacial potentials of mean force (PMFs) for
   PEG and Tween 80 using three force fields: the atomistic GROMOS
   53a6(OXY+D) and two coarse-grained (CG) MARTINI force fields. Because
   the force fields have not yet been validated for PEO adsorption to
   hydrophobic interfaces, we calculate PMFs for alcohol ethoxylates C12E2
   and C12E8 and find that they agree with semiempirical results of
   Mulqueen and Blankschtein {[}Langmuir 2002, 18 (2), 365-376] for the
   GROMOS 53a6(OXY+D) force field, whereas for both MARTINI force fields,
   PEO adsorbs too weakly to a clean hydrophobic interface. One MARTINI
   force field incorrectly shows depletion rather than adsorption to a
   clean hydrophobic interface. We find that the adsorption free energy for
   PEG oligomers at a clean, planar water/alkane interface is around 1.3
   k(B)T per monomer for the atomistic force field but is less than half of
   this for the two CG force fields. With the newly validated GROMOS
   53a6(OXY+D) force field, we bracket the dilute adsorption free energy

Abstract = {{We examine the role played by a linear dynamical network's topology in
   inference of its eigenvalues from noisy impulse-response data.
   Specifically, for a canonical linear-time-invariant network dynamics, we
   relate the Cramer-Rao bounds on eigenvalue estimator performance (from
   impulse-response data) to structural properties of the transfer function
   and in turn, to the network's topological structure. We begin by
   reviewing and enhancing algebraic characterizations of such eigenvalue
   estimates, which are based on pole-residue and pole-zero representations
   of the network's dynamics. We use these results to characterize mode
   estimation in networks with slow-coherency structures, finding that
   stimulus and observation in each strongly connected network subgraph is
   needed for high-fidelity estimation. We also obtain spectral and
   graphical characterizations of estimator performance for other graph
   classes (e.g., trees) and for the general case. These characterizations
   are used to determine the role of measurement and actuation locations in
   estimation performance. Finally, application of our results in
   dynamical-network security is illustrated through a simple example, and
   a concrete procedure for network mode estimation that draws on our
   structural results is introduced to conclude the article. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{The hydrophilicity of the extracellular matrix is one of the most
   important factors affecting cell adhesion in tissue engineering. In the
   present study, to improve the cellular biocompatibility of
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofiber scaffolds, their surface
   hydrophilicity was enhanced by electrospinning PCL with biocompatible,
   amphiphilic poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)-b-PCL (PVP-b-PCL) block copolymer.
   The PVP-b-PCL block copolymer (M-n = 26,300 g/mol, M-w/M-n = 1.14) was
   synthesized using 2-hydroxyethyl 2(ethoxycarbonothioylthio)propanoate as
   a dual initiator for reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer
   polymerization and ring opening polymerization in a one-pot procedure.
   As the content of PVP-b-PCL block copolymer increased, the surface of
   the PCL/PVP-b-PCL nanofiber scaffolds became more hydrophilic. The
   scaffolds showed no cytotoxicity, better cell adhesion, and improved
   viability of primary fibroblasts than PCL scaffolds, and did not lose
   their structure during cell culture. In particular, the PCL/PVP-b-PCL
   (90/10, w/w) nanofiber scaffold produced the highest cell viability,
   suggesting that appropriate scaffold hydrophilicity is required to
   enhance cell activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Efficacy of Photo Dynamic Therapy in 3D Cell Cultures}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{Photodynamic therapy (PDT), wherein light sensitive non-toxic agents are
   locally and selectively activated using light, has emerged as an
   appealing alternative to traditional cancer chemotherapy. Yet to date,
   PDT efficacy has been mostly characterized using 2D cultures. Compared
   to 2D cultures, 3D sphere culture generates unique spatial distributions
   of nutrients and oxygen for the cells that better mimics the in-vivo
   conditions. Using a novel polyHEMA (non-adherent polymer) fabrication
   process, we developed a microfluidic sphere formation platform that can
   (1) generate 1,024 uniform (size variation <10\%) cancer spheres within
   a 2 cm by 2 cm core area, (2) culture spheres for more than 2 weeks, and
   (3) allow the retrieval of spheres. Using the presented platform, we
   have successfully characterized the different responses in 2D and 3D
   cell culture to PDT. Furthermore, we investigated the treatment
   resistance effect in cancer cells induced by tumor associated
   fibroblasts (CAF). Although the CAFs can enhance the resistance to
   traditional chemotherapy agents, no significant difference in PDT was
   observed. The preliminary results suggest that the PDT can be an
   attractive alternative cancer therapy, which is less affected by the
   therapeutic resistance induced by cancer associated cells.}},

   measured, for the first time, the small signal modulation
   characteristics of a GaN-based electrically pumped polariton laser
   operating at room temperature. A maximum -3 dB modulation bandwidth of
   1.18 GHz is measured. The experimental results have been analyzed with a
   theoretical model based on the Boltzmann kinetic equations and the
   agreement is very good. We have also investigated frequency chirping
   during such modulation. Gain compression phenomenon in a polariton laser
   is interpreted and a value is obtained for the gain compression factor.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are being investigated in the
   context plasma medicine and biotechnology applications, and surface
   functionalization. The composition of the surface being treated ranges
   from plastics, liquids, and biological tissue, to metals. The dielectric
   constant of these materials ranges from as low as 1.5 for plastics to
   near 80 for liquids, and essentially infinite for metals. The electrical
   properties of the surface are not independent variables as the
   permittivity of the material being treated has an effect on the dynamics
   of the incident APPJ. In this paper, results are discussed from a
   computational investigation of the interaction of an APPJ incident onto
   materials of varying permittivity, and their impact on the discharge
   dynamics of the plasma jet. The computer model used in this
   investigation solves Poisson's equation, transport equations for charged
   and neutral species, the electron energy equation, and the Navier-Stokes
   equations for the neutral gas flow. The APPJ is sustained in He/O-2 =
   99.8/0.2 flowing into humid air, and is directed onto dielectric
   surfaces in contact with ground with dielectric constants ranging from 2
   to 80, and a grounded metal surface. Low values of relative permittivity
   encourage propagation of the electric field into the treated material
   and formation and propagation of a surface ionization wave. High values
   of relative permittivity promote the restrike of the ionization wave and
   the formation of a conduction channel between the plasma discharge and
   the treated surface. The distribution of space charge surrounding the
   APPJ is discussed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   nanotechnology enable novel lenses, such as, superlens and hyperlens,
   with sub-wavelength resolution capabilities by specially designed
   materials' refractive indices with meta-materials and transformation
   optics. However, these artificially nano- or micro-engineered lenses
   usually suffer high losses from metals and are highly demanding in
   fabrication. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, a
   nonlinear dielectric magnifying lens using negative refraction by
   degenerate four-wave mixing in a plano-concave glass slide, obtaining
   magnified images. Moreover, we transform a nonlinear flat lens into a
   magnifying lens by introducing transformation optics into the nonlinear
   regime, achieving an all-optical controllable lensing effect through
   nonlinear wave mixing, which may have many potential applications in
   microscopy and imaging science.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a local real-space formulation for orbital-free density
   functional theory (DFT) with density dependent kinetic energy
   functionals and a unified variational framework for computing the
   configurational forces associated with geometry optimization of both
   internal atomic positions as well as the cell geometry. The proposed
   real-space formulation, which involves a reformulation of the extended
   interactions in electrostatic and kinetic energy functionals as local
   variational problems in auxiliary potential fields, also readily extends
   to all-electron orbital-free DFT calculations that are employed in warm
   dense matter calculations. We use the local real-space formulation in
   conjunction with higher-order finite-element discretization to
   demonstrate the accuracy of orbital-free DFT and the proposed formalism
   for the Al-Mg materials system, where we obtain good agreement with
   Kohn-Sham DFT calculations on a wide range of properties and benchmark
   calculations. Finally, we investigate the cell-size effects in the
   electronic structure of point defects, in particular, a monovacancy in
   Al. We unambiguously demonstrate that the cell-size effects observed
   from vacancy formation energies computed using periodic boundary
   conditions underestimate the extent of the electronic structure
   perturbations created by the defect. On the contrary, the bulk Dirichlet
   boundary conditions, accessible only through the proposed real-space
   formulation, which correspond to an isolated defect embedded in the
   bulk, show cell-size effects in the defect formation energy that are
   commensurate with the perturbations in the electronic structure. Our
   studies suggest that even for a simple defect like a vacancy in Al, we
   require cell sizes of similar to 10(3) atoms for convergence in the
   electronic structure.}},

Abstract = {{To establish a theoretical framework for generalizing Monte Carlo
   transport algorithms by adding external electromagnetic fields to the
   Boltzmann radiation transport equation in a rigorous and consistent
   fashion. Using first principles, the Boltzmann radiation transport
   equation is modified by adding a term describing the variation of the
   particle distribution due to the Lorentz force. The implications of this
   new equation are evaluated by investigating the validity of Fano's
   theorem. Additionally, Lewis' approach to multiple scattering theory in
   infinite homogeneous media is redefined to account for the presence of
   external electromagnetic fields. The equation is modified and yields a
   description consistent with the deterministic laws of motion as well as
   probabilistic methods of solution. The time-independent Boltzmann
   radiation transport equation is generalized to account for the
   electromagnetic forces in an additional operator similar to the
   interaction term. Fano's and Lewis' approaches are stated in this new
   equation. Fano's theorem is found not to apply in the presence of
   electromagnetic fields. Lewis' theory for electron multiple scattering
   and moments, accounting for the coupling between the Lorentz force and
   multiple elastic scattering, is found. However, further investigation is
   required to develop useful algorithms for Monte Carlo and deterministic
   transport methods. To test the accuracy of Monte Carlo transport
   algorithms in the presence of electromagnetic fields, the Fano cavity
   test, as currently defined, cannot be applied. Therefore, new tests must
   be designed for this specific application. A multiple scattering theory
   that accurately couples the Lorentz force with elastic scattering could
   improve Monte Carlo efficiency. The present study proposes a new
   theoretical framework to develop such algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{A transmissibility is a relationship between signals of the same type,
   where the input and the output of the transmissibility are outputs of
   the underlying system. Transmissibility estimates are traditionally
   obtained using frequency-domain methods, which are based on the
   assumption that the input and output signals are stationary, and thus
   initial conditions and transient effects are ignored. In this paper we
   develop a time domain framework for SISO and MIMO transmissibilities
   that accounts for nonzero initial conditions for both force driven and
   displacement driven structures. We show that transmissibilities in force
   driven and displacement driven structures are equal when the locations
   of the forces and prescribed displacements are identical. We present
   three examples to illustrate this equality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   mainly modulate the ON-state transconductance of the transistor, which
   is attributed to the antigen-induced disordered potential in the MoS2

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Various spheroid formation techniques have been widely developed for
   efficient and reliable 3-D cell culture research. Although those efforts
   improved many aspects of spheroid generation, the procedures became
   complex and also required unusual laboratory equipment. Many recent
   techniques still involve laborious pipetting steps for spheroid
   manipulation such as collection, distribution and reseeding. In this
   report, we used a density-controlled polyethylene glycol and dextran
   aqueous two phase system to generate spheroids that are both consistent
   in size and precisely size-controllable. Moreover, by adding a few drops
   of fresh medium to the wells the contain spheroids, they can be simply
   settled and attached to the culture surface due to reduced densities of
   the phases. This unique attribute of the technique significantly reduces
   the numerous pipetting steps of spheroid manipulation to a single
   pipetting; therefore, the errors from those steps are eliminated and the
   reliability and efficiency of a research can be maximized.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)
   mediate nonimage-forming visual functions such as pupillary constriction
   and circadian photoentrainment. Optimizing daytime nonimage-forming
   photostimulation has health benefits. We aimed to enhance ipRGC
   excitation using flickering instead of steady light.
   METHODS. Human subjects were tested with a three-dimensional matrix of
   flickering 463-nm stimuli: three photon counts (13.7, 14.7 and 15.7 log
   photons cm(-2)), three duty cycles (12\%, 47\%, and 93\%) and seven
   flicker frequencies (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 7 Hz). Steady-state
   pupil constrictions were measured.
   RESULTS. Among stimuli containing 13.7 log photons cm(-2), the one
   flickering at 2 Hz with a 12\% duty cycle evoked the greatest pupil
   constriction of 48\% +/- 4\%, 71\% greater than that evoked by an
   equal-intensity (12.3 log photons cm(-2) s(-1)) continuous light. This
   frequency and duty cycle were also best for 14.7 log photons cm(-2)
   stimuli, inducing a 58\% +/- 4\% constriction which was 38\% more than
   that caused by an equal-intensity (13.3 log photons cm(-2) s(-1))
   constant light. For 15.7 log photons cm(-2) stimuli, the 1-Hz, 47\% duty
   cycle flicker was optimal although it evoked the same constriction as
   the best 14.7 log photons cm(-2) flicker.
   CONCLUSIONS. Pupillary constriction depends on flicker frequency and
   duty cycle besides intensity. Among the stimuli tested, the one with the
   lowest photon count inducing a maximal response is 13.3 log photons
   cm(-2) s(-1) flickering at 2 Hz with 12\% duty cycle. Our data could
   guide the design of healthier architectural lighting and better
   phototherapy devices for treating seasonal affective disorder and jet

Abstract = {{A generic waverider-type hypersonic aircraft that undergoes an ascent
   trajectory has been modeled using a first-principles reduced-order
   model. Two types of operability limits are added that represent
   boundaries on the aircraft trajectory map (of vehicle altitude versus
   Mach number). These boundaries are associated with engine unstart and
   ram-scram transition. The predicted unstart boundary is to be avoided;
   the ram-scram transition is a condition through which the aircraft must
   fly, but it is useful for the control system to know when this
   transition is approached to account for possible sudden changes in
   thrust and moments. The model shows that unstart occurs if the aircraft
   flies too high, too slow, or at too great of an acceleration. The
   unstart limit can be avoided by selecting a trajectory having
   sufficiently large dynamic pressure or a low vehicle acceleration.
   Optimizing these factors avoids an excessive value of the fuel-air ratio
   that is required for trim. The model also identifies an engine inlet
   geometry that avoids unstart. To assess the model, the computed results
   are compared to some available experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Histotripsy is a nonthermal, noninvasive, pulsed
   ultrasound technology that homogenizes tissue within the targeted
   volume. From previous experiments, it appeared that the resultant
   fibrotic response from histotripsy was limited compared with the typical
   tissue response seen after thermoablation. The objective of this study
   was to characterize the inflammatory response and quantify patterns of
   collagen deposition 6 weeks after in vivo canine prostate histotripsy.
   Methods: Histotripsy was applied to the left half of eight canine
   prostates to produce an intraparenchymal zone of tissue homogenization.
   Six weeks after treatment, prostates were harvested, sectioned, and
   stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic evaluation, CD3, CD20,
   and Mac387 immunohistochemistry to characterize the inflammatory
   components, and picrosirius red staining to identify collagen. Results:
   Seven of eight treated prostates exhibited only minimal residual
   inflammation. Visual microscopic analysis of picrosirius red slides
   revealed a band of dense collagen (0.5mm wide) immediately adjacent to
   the cavity produced by histotripsy. This was surrounded by a second band
   (1mm wide) of less dense collagen interspersed among glandular
   architecture. A lobar distribution of epithelial atrophy and basal cell
   hyperplasia reminiscent of periurethral glands and ducts was apparent
   surrounding the margin of the treatment cavities. Tissue loss (-31\%)
   was apparent on the treated side of all prostates while four
   demonstrated a net decrease in collagen content. Conclusions:In vivo
   histotripsy of canine prostate produced a decrease in prostate volume
   coupled with a limited inflammatory and fibrotic response. A narrow
   (1.5mm) band of fibrosis around the empty, reepithelialized treatment
   cavity was observed 6 weeks after treatment. In four cases, an overall
   reduction in collagen content was measured. Further studies are planned
   to correlate these histologic findings with alteration in mechanical
   tissue properties and to explore histotripsy strategies for treatment of
   benign prostatic hyperplasia that optimize tissue volume removal with
   minimization of fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{CoAl2O4 pigments were synthesized through Liquid-Feed Flame Spray
   Pyrolysis (LF-FSP) method using metallorganic precursors of cobalt
   propionate and alumatrane. The precursors were dissolved in ethanol and
   aerosolized into a methane/oxygen flame where it was combusted to result
   in nanopowders at a single step. The resulting nanopowders were
   collected in electrostatic precipitators and analyzed by x-ray
   Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR),
   colorimetry, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and
   BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) nitrogen adsorption. Results show formation
   of single phase blue nanopigments, suggesting that LF-FSP is an
   excellent method to produce nanoparticles with high quality in a
   continuous process for new industrial applications. The nanoparticles
   presented spherical morphology with specific surface area of 50 m(2)/g,
   corresponding to average particle size of 27 nm. The pigments were
   calcined at 500, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1300 degrees C, aiming to find
   the color stability whereby the colors were measured using the color
   space CIE L{*}a{*}b{*} under standardized D65 light. The brightest and
   bluest was obtained at calcination temperature of 1200 degrees C and its
   application into a glaze was carried out at 1200 degrees C to evaluate
   the color performance and stability after a decoration process. Finally,
   LF-FSP produced pigments were compared with those produced by solid
   state reaction. Differences in the color due to the average particle
   size and process conditions were observed. It is possible to obtain new
   hues for ceramic applications by LF-FSP method.}},

Abstract = {{The increased access to books afforded to blind people via e-publishing
   has given them long-sought independence for both recreational and
   educational reading. In most cases, blind readers access materials using
   speech output. For some content such as highly technical texts, music,
   and graphics, speech is not an appropriate access modality as it does
   not promote deep understanding. Therefore blind braille readers often
   prefer electronic braille displays. But, these are prohibitively
   expensive. The search is on, therefore, for a low-cost refreshable
   display that would go beyond current technologies and deliver graphical
   content as well as text. And many solutions have been proposed, some of
   which reduce costs by restricting the number of characters that can be
   displayed, even down to a single braille cell. In this paper, we
   demonstrate that restricting tactile cues during braille reading leads
   to poorer performance in a letter recognition task. In particular, we
   show that lack of sliding contact between the fingertip and the braille
   reading surface results in more errors and that the number of errors
   increases as a function of presentation speed. These findings suggest
   that single cell displays which do not incorporate sliding contact are
   likely to be less effective for braille reading.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic properties of solid waste are needed to reliably evaluate the
   seismic response of landfills. A testing method for investigating the
   dynamic properties of solid waste in situ has been implemented at
   various landfills. The field method is primarily aimed at evaluating
   shear wave and compression wave velocities at small strains as well as
   the shear modulus reduction versus shearing strain relationship of solid
   waste. In this study, shear modulus nonlinearity was successfully
   evaluated for shearing strains ranging from 10(-4) to 0.2 \%. The
   relationship between shear modulus and shearing strain was investigated
   by applying dynamic horizontal loads applied by a mobile field shaker at
   the waste surface in a staged-loading sequence. The solid waste response
   was measured with a buried array of three-component geophones. The
   testing method also permitted in situ assessment of the effect of
   confining stress and waste variability on the dynamic properties of
   solid waste. Load-settlement measurements and in situ unit weight
   measurements were also made. Testing equipment, field setup, testing
   procedure, data analysis, and examples of test results are presented.}},

Title = {{A microfluidic model to study fluid dynamics of mucus plug rupture in
   small lung airways}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Fluid dynamics of mucus plug rupture is important to understand mucus
   clearance in lung airways and potential effects of mucus plug rupture on
   epithelial cells at lung airway walls. We established a microfluidic
   model to study mucus plug rupture in a collapsed airway of the 12th
   generation. Mucus plugs were simulated using Carbopol 940 (C940) gels at
   concentrations of 0.15\%, 0.2\%, 0.25\%, and 0.3\%, which have
   non-Newtonian properties close to healthy and diseased lung mucus. The
   airway was modeled with a polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic channel.
   Plug motion was driven by pressurized air. Global strain rates and shear
   stress were defined to quantitatively describe plug deformation and
   rupture. Results show that a plug needs to overcome yield stress before
   deformation and rupture. The plug takes relatively long time to yield at
   the high Bingham number. Plug length shortening is the more significant
   deformation than shearing at gel concentration higher than 0.15\%.
   Although strain rates increase dramatically at rupture, the transient
   shear stress drops due to the shear-thinning effect of the C940 gels.
   Dimensionless time-averaged shear stress, T-xy, linearly increases from
   3.7 to 5.6 times the Bingham number as the Bingham number varies from
   0.018 to 0.1. The dimensionless time-averaged shear rate simply equals
   to T-xy/2. In dimension, shear stress magnitude is about one order lower
   than the pressure drop, and one order higher than yield stress. Mucus
   with high yield stress leads to high shear stress, and therefore would
   be more likely to cause epithelial cell damage. Crackling sounds
   produced with plug rupture might be more detectable for gels with higher
   concentration. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate physical effects influencing 0.5-2 GHz brightness
   temperatures of layered polar firn to support the Ultra Wide Band
   Software Defined Radiometer (UWBRAD) experiment to be conducted in
   Greenland and in Antarctica. We find that because ice particle grain
   sizes are very small compared to the 0.5-2 GHz wavelengths, volume
   scattering effects are small. Variations in firn density over cm-to
   m-length scales, however, cause significant effects. Both incoherent and
   coherent models are used to examine these effects. Incoherent models
   include a ``cloud model{''} that neglects any reflections internal to
   the ice sheet, and the DMRT-ML and MEMLS radiative transfer codes that
   are publicly available. The coherent model is based on the layered
   medium implementation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem for thermal
   microwave radiation from a medium having a nonuniform temperature.
   Density profiles are modeled using a stochastic approach, and model
   predictions are averaged over a large number of realizations to take
   into account an averaging over the radiometer footprint. Density
   profiles are described by combining a smooth average density profile
   with a spatially correlated random process to model density
   fluctuations. It is shown that coherent model results after ensemble
   averaging depend on the correlation lengths of the vertical density
   fluctuations. If the correlation length is moderate or long compared
   with the wavelength (similar to 0.6x longer or greater for Gaussian
   correlation function without regard for layer thinning due to
   compaction), coherent and incoherent model results are similar (within
   similar to 1 K). However, when the correlation length is short compared
   to the wavelength, coherentmodel results are significantly different
   from the incoherent model by several tens of kelvins. For a 10-cm
   correlation length, the differences are significant between 0.5 and 1.1
   GHz, and less for 1.1-2 GHz. Model results are shown to be able to match
   the v-pol SMOS data closely and predict the h-pol data for small
   observation angles.}},

Abstract = {{Multilayer assembly is a commonly used technique to construct multilayer
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic devices with complex 3D
   architecture and connectivity for large-scale microfluidic integration.
   Accurate alignment of structure features on different PDMS layers before
   their permanent bonding is critical in determining the yield and quality
   of assembled multilayer microfluidic devices. Herein, we report a
   custom-built desktop aligner capable of both local and global alignments
   of PDMS layers covering a broad size range. Two digital microscopes were
   incorporated into the aligner design to allow accurate global alignment
   of PDMS structures up to 4 in. in diameter. Both local and global
   alignment accuracies of the desktop aligner were determined to be about
   20 mu m cm(-1). To demonstrate its utility for fabrication of integrated
   multilayer PDMS microfluidic devices, we applied the desktop aligner to
   achieve accurate alignment of different functional PDMS layers in
   multilayer microfluidics including an organs-on-chips device as well as
   a microfluidic device integrated with vertical passages connecting
   channels located in different PDMS layers. Owing to its convenient
   operation, high accuracy, low cost, light weight, and portability, the
   desktop aligner is useful for microfluidic researchers to achieve rapid
   and accurate alignment for generating multilayer PDMS microfluidic
   devices. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in access-transistor-free memristive crossbars have
   demonstrated the potential of memristor arrays as high-density and
   ultra-low-power memory. However, with considerable variations in the
   write-time characteristics of individual memristors, conventional
   fixed-pulse write schemes cannot guarantee reliable completion of the
   write operations and waste significant amount of energy.
   We propose an adaptive write scheme that adaptively adjusts the write
   pulses to address such variations in memristive arrays, resulting in
   7x-11x average energy saving in our case studies. Our scheme embeds an
   online monitor to detect the completion of a write operation and takes
   into account the parasitic effect of line-shared devices in
   access-transistor-free crossbars. This feature also helps shorten the
   test time of memory march algorithms by eliminating the need of a
   verifying read right after a write, which is commonly employed in the
   test sequences of march algorithms.}},

Title = {{EGFR Overexpressed in Colonic Neoplasia Can be Detected on Wide-Field
   Endoscopic Imaging}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer initially lies dormant as dysplasia, a
   premalignant state that provides an opportunity for early cancer
   detection. Dysplasia can be flat in morphology, focal in size, and
   patchy in distribution, and thus it appears ``invisible{''} on
   conventional wide-field endoscopy.
   AIMS: We aim to develop and validate a peptide that is specific for
   epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR), a cell surface target that is
   overexpressed in colonic adenomas and is readily accessible for imaging.
   METHODS: We expressed and purified the extracellular domain of EGFR for
   use with phage display to identify a peptide QRHKPRE that binds to
   domain 2 of this target. A near-infrared fluorescence endoscope was used
   to perform in vivo imaging to validate specific peptide binding to
   spontaneous colonic adenomas in a mouse model with topical
   administration. We also validated specific peptide binding to human
   colonic adenomas on immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.
   RESULTS: After labeling with Cy5.5, we validated specific peptide
   binding to EGFR on knockdown and competition studies. Peptide binding to
   cells occurred within 2.46 min and had an affinity of 50 nM. No
   downstream signaling was observed. We measured a target-to-background
   ratio of 4.0 +/- 1.7 and 2.7 +/- 0.7, for polyps and flat lesions,
   respectively. On immunofluorescence of human colonic specimens, greater
   intensity from peptide binding to dysplasia than normal was found with a
   19.4-fold difference.
   CONCLUSIONS: We have selected and validated a peptide that can be used
   as a specific contrast agent to identify colonic adenomas that
   overexpress EGFR in vivo on fluorescence endoscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Small spacecraft can now perform trajectory maneuvers resulting in
   significant orbit changes that were once only feasible with larger
   spacecraft due to the development of miniaturized propulsion technology.
   This paper addresses the feasibility of using CubeSat Ambipolar
   Thruster, a large Delta V miniaturized propulsion system for
   constellation control, Earth escape, and planetary flybys, to enable
   Earth-escape maneuvers on a CubeSat form factor. Operational and
   trajectory variables include the power setting during thrust maneuvers,
   when to thrust, and the attitude control inputs. The dynamic energy
   available through the maneuvers, which is constrained by the power
   available from the sun depending on the orbit and is consumed in
   propulsion, is modeled as well as attitude control maneuvers and
   realistic battery degradation. To explore the design space of this
   capability, the sensitivity of solutions to spacecraft mass, fuel
   quantity, initial orbit, solar power collection, and battery size is
   demonstrated. Optimal orbit-raising techniques are compared and the
   optimal approach depending on the goals is discussed (i.e., minimize
   time, minimize fuel, minimize batteries, minimize propulsion system
   volume, and minimize accumulated radiation). The models and results
   presented lay the groundwork for future work in integrated vehicle and
   operational design optimization problems with both interplanetary and

Abstract = {{The exceptional activity for methane combustion of modular
   palladium-ceria core-shell subunits on silicon-functionalized alumina
   that was recently reported has created renewed interest in the potential
   of core-shell structures as catalysts. Here we report on our use of
   advanced ex situ and in situ electron microscopy with atomic resolution
   to show that the modular palladium-ceria core-shell subunits undergo
   structural evolution over a wide temperature range. In situ observations
   performed in an atmospheric gas cell within this temperature range
   provide real-time evidence that the palladium and ceria nanoparticle
   constituents of the palladium-ceria core-shell participate in a
   dynamical process that leads to the formation of an unanticipated
   structure comprised of an intimate mixture of palladium, cerium, silicon
   and oxygen, with very high dispersion. This finding may open new
   perspectives about the origin of the activity of this catalyst.}},

   fabricated at University of Michigan that is aeroelastically
   representative of very flexible aircraft. Known as X-HALE, this

   characteristics designed into the experiment. This paper presents the
   data from the initial flight tests of the lightly instrumented X-HALE
   Risk Reduction Vehicle that confirm the expected aeroelastic

Abstract = {{Spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) based devices have recently
   garnered a great deal of attention owing to their ability to propagate
   THz signal without dispersion and very low signal attenuation. In this

   full-field analysis on the periodically corrugated cylindrical
   waveguide. It has been shown that this structure has the capability of
   propagating localized spoof surface plasmons polariton (SSPP) mode of EM
   waves. The variation of band diagrams as a function of different groove
   dimensions has been investigated. Finally, by employing cylindrical SSPP
   a new polarizer controller has been designed that can be utilized to
   design THz Boolean gates.}},

Abstract = {{Computational methods for solving problems of fluid dynamics and
   fluid-solid-interactions have advanced to the point that they enable
   reliable estimates of many hemodynamic quantities, including those
   important for studying vascular mechanobiology or designing medical
   devices. In this paper, we use a customized version of the open source
   code SimVascular to develop a computational model of central artery
   hemodynamics in anesthetized mice that is informed with experimental
   data on regional geometries, blood flows and pressures, and biaxial wall
   properties. After validating a baseline model against available data, we
   then use the model to investigate the effects of commercially available
   catheters on the very parameters that they are designed to measure,
   namely, murine blood pressure and (pressure) pulse wave velocity (PWV).
   We found that a combination of two small profile catheters designed to
   measure pressure simultaneously in the ascending aorta and femoral
   artery increased the PWV due to an overall increase in pressure within
   the arterial system. Conversely, a larger profile dual-sensor pressure
   catheter inserted through a carotid artery into the descending thoracic
   aorta decreased the PWV due to an overall decrease in pressure. In both
   cases, similar reductions in cardiac output were observed due to
   increased peripheral vascular resistance. As might be expected,
   therefore, invasive transducers can alter the very quantities that are
   designed to measure, yet advanced computational models offer a unique
   method to evaluate or augment such measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Rho-GTPases are small GTP-binding proteins that contribute to the
   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by regulating several cellular
   processes including organization of the actin cytoskeleton, cell
   motility, transcription, and cell proliferation. Overexpression of
   RhoC-GTPases (RhoC) in breast cancer has been implicated in poor disease
   prognosis due to increased cancer cells invasion, migration, and
   motility, which warranted its consideration as a therapeutic target for
   inhibiting breast cancer metastasis. Using silencing RNA (siRNA)
   molecules to knockdown RhoC expression is a promising approach to
   inhibit breast cancer metastases. However, transforming anti-RhoC siRNA
   molecules into a viable therapy remains a challenge due to the lack of a
   biocompatible carrier that can selectively deliver the RNA cargo into
   breast cancer cells. We report the use of a degradable, pH-sensitive,
   beta-cyclodextrin (beta CD)-based polymeric carrier that condenses
   anti-RhoC siRNA forming ``smart{''} particles. These smart anti-RhoC
   particles were efficiently internalized, successfully escaped the
   endosome, and delivered the RNA cargo into the cytoplasm of SUM 149 and
   MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Our results show that anti-RhoC
   particles used at a low N/P ratio of 2.5/1 suppressed RhoC protein
   levels by 100\% and 90\% in SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively.
   Further, anti-RhoC particles inhibited the invasion, motility, and
   migration of SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells by 40-47\%, 57-60\%, and
   61.5-73\%, respectively. Smart particles encapsulating the scrambled
   siRNA sequence did not affect RhoC protein expression or the invasion,
   motility, and migration of SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells, which indicate
   the biocompatibility of the polymeric carrier and selectivity of the
   observed RhoC knockdown. These results collectively indicate the
   therapeutic potential of smart anti-RhoC particles in arresting the
   metastatic spread of breast cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetically tuning the surface properties of many oxide catalysts to
   optimize their catalytic activity has been appreciably challenging,
   given their complex crystal structure. Nickelate oxides (e.g.,
   La2NiO4+delta) are among complex, layered oxides with great potential
   toward efficiently catalyzing chemical/electrochemical reactions
   involving oxygen (oxygen reduction, ammonia oxidation). Our theoretical
   calculations show that the surface structure of La2NiO4+delta plays a
   critical role in its activity, with the (001)-Ni oxide-terminated
   surface being the most active. This is demonstrated through the effect
   on the energetics associated with surface oxygen exchange, a key process
   in reactions involving oxygen on these oxides. Using a reverse
   microemulsion method, we have synthesized La2NiO4+delta
   nanorod-structured catalysts highly populated by (001)-Ni
   oxide-terminated surfaces. We show that these nanostructures exhibit
   superior catalytic activity toward oxygen exchange/reduction as compared
   with traditional catalysts while maintaining stability under reaction
   conditions. The findings reported here pave the way for engineering
   complex metal oxides with optimal activity.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy has been investigated as a noninvasive, drug-free,
   image-guided thrombolysis method that fractionates blood clots using
   acoustic cavitation alone. In previous histotripsy-mediated thrombolysis
   studies, cavitation clouds were generated using multi-cycle pulses and
   tended to form on vessel wall. To avoid potential cavitational damage to
   the vessel wall, a new histotripsy approach, termed microtripsy, has
   been recently discovered in which cavitation is generated via an
   intrinsic-threshold mechanism using single-cycle pulses. We hypothesize
   that microtripsy can generate and confine cavitation in vessel lumen
   without contacting the vessel wall, which results in recanalization
   within the clot and potentially eliminating vessel damage. To test our
   hypothesis, microtripsy was investigated for clot recanalization in an
   in vitro flow model. Clots were formed inside a vessel phantom (6.5 mm
   inner diameter) in line with a flow system. Microtripsy was applied by a
   1-MHz transducer at a pulse repetition frequency of 50 Hz with a peak
   negative pressure (P-) of 30 MPa or 36 MPa. To create a flow channel
   through a clot, the cavitation focus was scanned through the clot at an
   interval of 0.3 or 0.7 mm. The treated clots were 3-D-scanned by a
   20-MHz ultrasound probe to quantify the channels. Restored flow rates
   were measured and clot debris particles generated from the treatments
   were analyzed. In all treatments, the cavitation cloud was consistently
   generated in the center of the vessel lumen without contacting the
   vessel wall. After each treatment, a flow channel was successfully
   generated through and completely confined inside the clot. The channels
   had a diameter up to 60\% of the vessel diameter, with restored flow up
   to 500 mL/min. The debris particles were small with more than 99.9\% <10
   mu m and the largest at 153 um. Each clot (2 cm long) was recanalized
   within 7 min. The size of the flow channels increased by using higher
   P-and was significantly larger by using the 0.3 mm scan interval than
   those using 0.7 mm. The results in this study show the potential of this
   new microtripsy thrombolysis method for fast, precise, and effective
   clot recanalization, minimizing risks of vessel damage and embolism.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this work was to fabricate and evaluate new
   antibacterial and bioactive composites capable of strictly controlling
   oral bacteria, enhancing apatite layer formation and retaining their
   mechanical properties.
   Methods: A new Ag-doped bioactive glass (Ag-BG) was incorporated into
   flowable dental composite (COMP) in different concentrations (1, 5, and
   15 wt.\%) in order to fabricate new combined bioactive and antibacterial
   composite materials (Ag-BGCOMPs). The antibacterial properties,
   bioactivity, and total bond strength of the Ag-BGCOMPs were evaluated.
   Results: The bioactivity of the Ag-BG was confirmed after its immersion
   in simulated body fluid (SBF). The total bond strength between the
   surrounding tooth tissue and the new composites or the control (dental
   composite alone) has not shown any statistically significant difference
   in the performed pilot study. Antibacterial activity was observed
   against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans)
   for the Ag-BGCOMP 5 wt.\% and 15 wt.\% but not for the Ag-BGCOMP 1 wt.\%
   or the control.
   Conclusions: This work contributes to our long term aim which is the
   fabrication of dental materials capable of reducing bacteria invasion
   and enhancing remineralization of the surrounding dental tissues.
   Significance: We anticipate that these new composites could ultimately
   prevent restoration failure by inhibiting the formation of secondary
   caries and by remineralizing the hard tissues surrounding tooth lesions.

Abstract = {{Ovarian cancer is known to be composed of distinct populations of cancer
   cells, some of which demonstrate increased capacity for cancer
   initiation and/or metastasis. The study of human cancer cell populations
   is difficult due to long requirements for tumor growth, interpatient
   variability, and the need for tumor growth in immune-deficient mice. We
   therefore characterized the cancer initiation capacity of distinct
   cancer cell populations in a transgenic murine model of ovarian cancer.
   In this model, conditional deletion of Apc, Pten, and Trp53 in the
   ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) results in the generation of high-grade
   metastatic ovarian carcinomas. Cell lines derived from these murine
   tumors express numerous putative stem cell markers, including CD24,
   CD44, CD90, CD117, CD133, and ALDH. We show that CD24(+) and CD133(+)
   cells have increased tumor sphere-forming capacity. CD133(+) cells
   demonstrated a trend for increased tumor initiation while CD24(+) cells
   versus CD24(-) cells had significantly greater tumor initiation and
   tumor growth capacity. No preferential tumor-initiating or growth
   capacity was observed for CD44(-), CD90(-), CD117(-), or ALDH(+) versus
   their negative counterparts. We have found that CD24+ cells, compared
   with CD24(-) cells, have increased phosphorylation of STAT3 and
   increased expression of STAT3 target Nanog and c-myc. JAK2 inhibition of
   STAT3 phosphorylation preferentially induced cytotoxicity in CD24(-)
   cells. In vivo JAK2 inhibitor therapy dramatically reduced tumor
   metastases, and prolonged overall survival. These findings indicate that
   CD24(-) cells play a role in tumor migration and metastasis and support
   JAK2 as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer. (C) 2015 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{A correction-based resonance self-shielding method is developed that
   allows annular subdivision of the fuel rod. The method performs the
   conventional iteration of the embedded self-shielding method (ESSM)
   without subdivision of the fuel to capture the interpin shielding
   effect. The resultant self-shielded cross sections are modified by
   correction factors incorporating the intrapin effects of radial
   variation of the shielded cross section, radial temperature
   distribution, and resonance interference. A quasi one-dimensional
   slowing-down equation is developed to calculate such correction factors.
   The method is implemented in the DeCART code and compared with the
   conventional ESSM and subgroup method with benchmark MCNP results. The
   new method yields substantially improved results for both spatially
   dependent reaction rates and eigenvalues for typical pressurized water
   reactor pin cell cases with uniform and nonuniform fuel temperature
   profiles. The new method is also proved effective in treating assembly
   heterogeneity and complex material composition such as mixed oxide fuel,
   where resonance interference is much more intense.}},

Abstract = {{Selective catalytic reduction of NOx with hydrogen (H-2-SCR) in excess
   oxygen over Pd and Ir based catalysts with various silica supports was
   studied. The Pd/V2O5/TiO2/SBA-15 and Ir/SBA-15 catalysts showed the
   highest activities. The effects of noble metal, various silica supports,
   CO and SO2 on H-2-SCR over these catalysts were also studied and
   compared, and possible underlying mechanisms discussed. A comparison of
   1 \% Ir-doped on silicas with a wide range of pore sizes showed that the
   peak temperature (where the NO conversion maximum was located) was
   directly related to the pore size: larger pores of the support resulted
   in higher peak temperatures. This result indicates that pore diffusion
   limitation played a role in determining the peak temperature. In
   addition, a non-noble metal catalyst, Nb2O5/SiO2, was found to have
   considerable activity.
   Larger pores of the support resulted in higher peak temperatures, which
   indicated that pore diffusion limitation played a direct role.

Abstract = {{High-gain lens antennas with a subwavelength thickness that radiate
   linearly and circularly polarized waves are reported. The lens antennas
   are fed with a planar, leaky radial waveguide that generates a
   TM-polarized Bessel beam (Bessel beam launcher). Two different
   metasurface lenses are placed a subwavelength distance from the Bessel
   beam launcher to collimate the radiation with minimal reflection loss.
   The unit cells of the two metasurface lenses are designed to act as
   inhomogenous wave plates to convert the polarization from radial to
   linear and circular, respectively. The lens antennas are fabricated
   using standard printed circuit board processes, and their performance is
   experimentally characterized. The antennas achieve an order of magnitude
   thickness reduction over previously reported lens antennas since the
   metasurface lenses are directly integrated with the antenna feed.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid lattice cores for sandwich structures containing both solid
   struts and polymer foam are a recent option available to designers.
   These cores benefit from a synergistic effect in which the foam supports
   the slender struts against buckling in addition to carrying a portion of
   the applied loads directly. This work will optimize these hybrid cores
   to minimize unit cell density given compressive and shear strength
   constraints for a variety of unit cell configurations. An analytical
   model is developed for prediction of failure using the assumption that
   the foam is an elastic foundation that supports the struts; however, the
   unit cells are found to be optimal when no polymer foam is used. With
   the problem thereby simplified, analytical optimization solutions are
   derived and studied extensively, revealing qualitative insights about
   efficient lattice core designs. Optimal strut inclination angle, failure
   mode, and configuration are plotted against loading, which show that,
   for the large majority of strength constraints, the lowest unit cell
   density is achieved with tetrahedral cores whose struts fail in
   compressive yielding.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the void swelling resistance of reduced-activation

   irradiation was performed up to 188 dpa (4.6 x 10(17) ion/cm(2)) at 460

   10 and 100 appm at room temperature to investigate the role of helium on
   void swelling. Commercial FM steel T91 was also irradiated in this
   condition and the swelling results are of included in this paper as a
   reference. Voids were observed in all conditions. The 9Cr CNS I samples
   implanted with 10 appm helium exhibited lower swelling than 9Cr T91
   irradiated at the same condition. The 12Cr CNS II with 10 and 100 appm
   helium showed significantly lower swelling than CNS I and T91. The
   swelling rate for CNS I and CNS II were determined to be 0.02\%/dpa and
   0.003\%/dpa respectively. Increasing the helium content from 10 to 100
   appm shortened the incubation region and increased the void density but
   had no effect on the swelling rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In an effort to understand the mechanisms resulting in the variations of

   electron energy loss spectroscopy and atom probe tomography. The results
   reveal a complex structure of different phases at different stages of
   corrosion. The oxide/metal interface exhibits an intermediate layer,
   with an oxygen content between 45 and 55 O at.\% and a suboxide layer
   corresponding to an oxygen-saturated solid solution in the metal matrix
   side (similar to 30 O at.\%). Local variations are observed in the width

Abstract = {{Void evolution in Fe++-irradiated ferritic-martensitic alloy HT9 was
   characterized in the temperature range of 400-480 degrees C between
   doses of 25 and 375 displacements per atom (dpa) with pre-implanted
   helium levels of 0-100 appm. A systematic study using depth profiling in
   cross-section samples was conducted to determine a valid region of
   analysis between 300 and 700 nm from the surface, which excluded effects
   due to the injected interstitial and the surface. Pre-implanted helium
   was found to promote void swelling at low doses by shortening the
   nucleation regime and to retard void growth at doses in the transient
   regime by enhancement of nucleation of small voids. Swelling was found
   to peak at a temperature of 460 degrees C. The primary effect of
   temperature was on the nucleation regime; nucleation regime was the
   shortest at 460 degrees C compared to that at 440 and 480 degrees C. The
   growth rate of voids was temperature-invariant. Steady state swelling
   was reached at 460 degrees C between 188 and 375 dpa at a rate of
   0.02\%/dpa. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We apply our recently developed mesoscopic simulation method for
   entangled wormlike micelle (WLM) solutions to extract multiple micellar
   characteristic lengths and time constants: i.e., average micelle length,
   breakage rate, and entanglement and persistence lengths, from linear
   rheological measurements on commercial surfactant solutions, one
   containing sodium lauryl one ether sulfate (SLE1S), and the other
   containing both SLE1S and cocamidopropyl betaine, as well as a perfume
   mixture, in both cases with a sample salt (NaCl) added. Measurements
   include both mechanical rheometry and diffusing wave spectroscopy, the
   latter providing the high-frequency data needed to determine micelle
   persistence length accurately. By fitting the experimental data (G' and
   G `') across the entire frequency range through our iteration procedure,
   the method is of practical use in predicting micellar parameters, which
   are difficult to obtain from other theoretical or experimental methods.
   The dependence of micellar parameters on added salt concentration, and
   the effect of micelle breakage mechanisms on viscoelasticity of WLM
   solutions, are also discussed. (C) 2015 The Society of Rheology.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},

Pages = {{55-61}},

Abstract = {{Background High-fidelity volitional control of bioengineered prosthetic
   limbs with multiple degrees of freedom requires the implantation of
   multiple recording interfaces to detect independent control signals.
   However, interface utilization is complicated by interfering
   electrophysiological signals originating from surrounding muscles and
   nerves, leading to equivocal signal detection. We developed and
   validated a surgical model to characterize signal propagation through
   various biomaterials to identify insulating substrates for use in
   implantable interfaces. The identification of these insulating materials
   will facilitate the acquisition of noncontaminated prosthetic control
   signals, thus improving manipulation of advanced prosthetic limbs.
   Methods Using a rat hindlimb model, 4 groups (n = 8/group) were tested.
   A medial gastrocnemius muscle flap was elevated, leaving the
   neurovascular pedicle intact. The flap was rotated into a chamber and
   secured to a silicone base. A stainless steel electrode was affixed to
   the surface of a muscle and encircled by 1-layer small intestinal
   submucosa (SIS), 4-layer SIS, silicone elastomer, or nothing
   (uninsulated). A superimposing electrode was attached, and an external
   silicone layer was wrapped around the construct and sutured in place.
   Electromyographic studies were then performed.
   Results This model was found to correspond with expected signal
   isolation characteristics of the nonconductive silicone group,
   electrically inert single and multilayer SIS group, and the uninsulated
   group. Signal isolation of compound muscle action potential amplitude at
   stimulation threshold was significantly greater using silicone (51.4\%)
   compared with the 1-layer SIS (-6.8\%), 4-layer SIS (-3.3\% ), or
   uninsulated groups (1.2\%) (P = <0.001). Isolation of the maximum
   compound muscle action potential peak-to-peak amplitude was also greater
   with silicone (56.7\%) versus the 1-layer SIS (1.5\%), 4-layer SIS
   (1.1\%), or uninsulated groups (-0.7\%) (P = <0.001).
   Conclusions This study demonstrates and validates a novel surgical model
   to characterize in vivo signal propagation and subsequently identify
   insulating materials for use in implantable interface systems currently
   in development. Improved signal isolation through the utilization of
   these materials stands to greatly improve control fidelity of
   neuroprosthetic limbs.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new multiobjective model predictive control
   (MO-MPC) of constrained nonlinear systems. According to objective
   prioritization, the MO-MPC problem is formulated as a lexicographic
   optimization problem. The optimal solutions are obtained by solving a
   hierarchy of single objective optimization problems. The conditions
   guaranteeing the recursive feasibility of the optimization problem and
   stability of the closed-loop system are derived, which depend only on
   the most important objective. Moreover, a suboptimal algorithm is
   presented to reduce the computational demand of MO-MPC. One
   characteristic of the proposed MO-MPC is that the given objective
   prioritization is automatically satisfied. The theoretical results are
   illustrated by a comparison study of an example. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Formation of stable small cell number three-dimensional ovarian cancer

Abstract = {{Background. Ovarian cancer grows and metastasizes from multicellular
   spheroidal aggregates within the ascites fluid. Multicellular tumor
   spheroids are therefore physiologically significant 3D in vitro models
   for ovarian cancer research. Conventional hanging drop cultures require
   high starting cell numbers, and are tedious for long-term maintenance.
   In this study, we generate stable, uniform multicellular spheroids using
   very small number of ovarian cancer cells in a novel 384 well hanging
   drop array platform.
   Methods. We used novel tumor spheroid platform and two ovarian cancer
   cell lines (A2780 and OVCAR3) to demonstrate the stable incorporation of
   as few as 10 cells into a single spheroid.
   Results. Spheroids had uniform geometry, with projected areas (42.60 x
   10(3) mu m-475.22 x 10(3) mu m(2) for A2780 spheroids and 37.24 x 10(3)
   mu m(2)-281.01 x 10(3) mu m(2) for OVCAR3 spheroids) that varied as a
   function of the initial cell seeding density. Phalloidin and nuclear
   stains indicated cells formed tightly packed spheroids with demarcated
   boundaries and cell-cell interaction within spheroids. Cells within
   spheroids demonstrated over 85\% viability. 3D tumor spheroids
   demonstrated greater resistance (70-80\% viability) to cisplatin
   chemotherapy compared to 20 cultures (30-50\% viability).
   Conclusions. Ovarian cancer spheroids can be generated from limited cell
   numbers in high throughput 384 well plates with high viability.
   Spheroids demonstrate therapeutic resistance relative to cells in
   traditional 2D culture. Stable incorporation of low cell numbers is
   advantageous when translating this research to rare patient-derived
   cells. This system can be used to understand ovarian cancer spheroid
   biology, as well as carry out preclinical drug sensitivity assays. (C)

Abstract = {{Quasilinear Control (QLC) is a set of methods for analysis and design of
   systems with nonlinear actuators and sensors. The approach of QLC is
   based on the method of stochastic linearization, which replaces each
   nonlinearity with an equivalent gain and bias. In this brief, we apply
   QLC to the design of controllers for regulating the power output of a
   wind farm with multiple wind turbines. Each of these turbines is modeled
   by a linear plant preceded by an asymmetric saturation nonlinearity,
   which accounts for the limited availability of wind. It is shown via
   numerical simulation that controllers designed using QLC perform
   significantly better in a broad range of wind farm operating regimes,
   compared with those designed using traditional linear methods in our
   earlier work, where saturation is ignored.}},

   spacecraft docking phase, with each phase having distinct requirements,
   constraints, and sampling rates. Obstacle avoidance is considered in the
   rendezvous phase, while a line-of-sight cone constraint, bandwidth
   constraints on the spacecraft attitude control system, and exhaust plume
   direction constraints are addressed during the docking phase. The MPC
   controller is demonstrated in simulation studies using a nonlinear model
   of spacecraft orbital motion. The implementation uses estimates of
   spacecraft states derived from relative angle and range measurements,

Abstract = {{Distribution utilities are becoming increasingly aware that their
   networks may struggle to accommodate a large number of plug-in electric
   vehicles (PEVs), especially at times of peak loading. In this paper, a
   centralized scheduling scheme is formulated to coordinate charging of a
   heterogeneous PEV fleet, which is then divided into load groups, each
   with a set of local objectives, constraints, and a decentralized control
   algorithm. Realistic energy tariffs are used to formulate probable
   ``real-world{''} objectives for each load group, and a distributed
   dynamic program is used to regulate the net load of each load group. It
   is shown that charging coordination not only reduces peak network loads,
   but can also significantly reduce the customer's PEV charging cost.
   Potential improvements from the perspective of communication and
   modeling are also highlighted by adopting a systematic approach to
   divide the PEV fleet into load groups.}},

Abstract = {{Bone engineering of localized craniofacial osseous defects or
   deficiencies by stem cell therapy offers strong prospects to improve
   treatment predictability for patient care. The aim of this phase 1/2
   randomized, controlled clinical trial was to evaluate reconstruction of
   bone deficiencies of the maxillary sinus with transplantation of
   autologous cells enriched with CD90+ stem cells and CD14+ monocytes.
   Thirty human participants requiring bone augmentation of the maxillary
   sinus were enrolled. Patients presenting with 50\% to 80\% bone
   deficiencies of the maxillary sinus were randomized to receive either
   stem cells delivered onto a -tricalcium phosphate scaffold or scaffold
   alone. Four months after treatment, clinical, radiographic, and
   histologic analyses were performed to evaluate de novo engineered bone.
   At the time of alveolar bone core harvest, oral implants were installed
   in the engineered bone and later functionally restored with dental tooth
   prostheses. Radiographic analyses showed no difference in the total bone
   volume gained between treatment groups; however, density of the
   engineered bone was higher in patients receiving stem cells. Bone core
   biopsies showed that stem cell therapy provided the greatest benefit in
   the most severe deficiencies, yielding better bone quality than control
   patients, as evidenced by higher bone volume fraction (BVF; 0.5 versus
   0.4; p=0.04). Assessment of the relation between degree of CD90+ stem
   cell enrichment and BVF showed that the higher the CD90 composition of
   transplanted cells, the greater the BVF of regenerated bone (r=0.56;
   p=0.05). Oral implants were placed and restored with functionally loaded
   dental restorations in all patients and no treatment-related adverse
   events were reported at the 1-year follow-up. These results provide
   evidence that cell-based therapy using enriched CD90+ stem cell
   populations is safe for maxillary sinus floor reconstruction and offers
   potential to accelerate and enhance tissue engineered bone quality in
   other craniofacial bone defects and deficiencies ( NCT00980278). (c)

Abstract = {{Obesity not only adds to the mass that must be carried during walking
   but also changes body composition. Although extra mass causes roughly
   proportional increases in musculoskeletal loading, less well understood
   is the effect of relatively soft and mechanically compliant adipose
   tissue. Purpose: This purpose of this study was to estimate the work
   performed by soft tissue deformations during walking. The soft tissue
   would be expected to experience damped oscillations, particularly from
   high force transients after heel strike, and could potentially change
   the mechanical work demands for walking. Methods: We analyzed treadmill
   walking data at 1.25 ms(-1) for 11 obese (BMI >30 kgm(-2)) and nine
   nonobese (BMI <30 kgm(-2)) adults. The soft tissue work was quantified
   with a method that compares the work performed by lower extremity joints
   as derived using assumptions of rigid body segments, with that estimated
   without rigid body assumptions. Results: Relative to body mass, obese
   and nonobese individuals perform similar amounts of mechanical work.
   However, negative work performed by soft tissues was significantly
   greater in obese individuals (P = 0.0102), equivalent to approximately
   0.36 Jkg(-1) vs 0.27 Jkg(-1) in nonobese individuals. The negative
   (dissipative) work by soft tissues occurred mainly after heel strike
   and, for obese individuals, was comparable in magnitude to the total
   negative work from all of the joints combined (0.34 Jkg(-1) vs 0.33
   Jkg(-1) for obese and nonobese adults, respectively). Although the
   joints performed a relatively similar amount of work overall, obese
   individuals performed less negative work actively at the knee.
   Conclusions: The greater proportion of soft tissues in obese individuals
   results in substantial changes in the amount, location, and timing of
   work and may also affect metabolic energy expenditure during walking.}},

Abstract = {{The photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs) can be
   improved by incorporating zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures of different
   particle morphology in combination with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)
   and {[}6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in the active
   layer of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs. Special emphasis is made to
   study the effect of the stabilizer-free ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) geometry
   - nanospheres, nanoplates and nanopyramids in the active layer of BHJ
   PSCs. The concentration of ZnO NPs in the active layer of BHJ blends was
   varied from 1 to 6 wt\%. Incorporation of NPs in the blend of active
   layer material (P3HT:PC71BM) increases the absorptivity with increasing
   concentration of ZnO NPs due to the light scattering effect of ZnO,
   which enhances the photovoltaic performance of the resultant polymer
   solar cells. The influence of the morphology and the concentration of
   the ZnO NPs on the general performance of the PSC devices are discussed
   in detail. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Swift heavy ion (2 GeV Ta-181) irradiation-induced amorphization and
   temperature-induced recrystallization of cubic pyrochlore Gd2Ti2O7 (Fd
   (3) over barm) are compared with the response of a
   compositionally-similar material with a monoclinic-layered
   perovskite-type structure, La2Ti2O7 (P2(1)). The averaged electronic
   energy loss, dE/dx, was 37 keV/nm and 35 keV/nm in Gd2Ti2O7 and
   La2Ti2O7, respectively. Systematic analysis of the structural
   modifications was completed using transmission electron microscopy,
   synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and small-angle X-ray
   scattering. Increasing ion-induced amorphization with increasing ion
   fluence was evident in the X-ray diffraction patterns cif both
   compositions by a reduction in the intensity of the diffraction maxima
   concurrent with the growth in intensity of a broad diffuse scattering
   halo. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed complete
   amorphization within ion tracks (diameter: similar to 10 nm) for the
   perovskite-type material; whereas a concentric, core shell morphology
   was evident in the ion tracks of the pyrochlore, with an outer shell of
   disordered yet still crystalline material with the fluorite structure
   surrounding an amorphous track core (diameter: nm). The radiation
   response of both titanate oxides with the same stoichiometry can be
   understood in terms of differences in their structures and compositions.
   While the radiation damage susceptibility of pyrochlore A(2)B(2)O(7)
   materials decreases as a function of the cation radius ratio r(A)/r(B),
   the current study correlates this behavior with the stability field of
   monoclinic structures, where r(La)/r(Ti) > r(Gd)/r(Ti). Isochronal
   annealing experiments of the irradiated materials showed complete
   recrystallization of La2Ti2O7 at 775 degrees C and of Gd2Ti2O7 at 850
   degrees C. The annealing behavior is discussed in terms of enhanced
   damage recovery in La2Ti2O7, compared to the pyrochlore compounds
   Gd2Ti2O7. The difference in the recrystallization behavior may be
   related to structural constraints, i.e., reconstructing a low symmetry
   versus a high symmetry phase. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{A probabilistic scheme is presented for simulating evolution of
   polycrystalline microstructures during deformation. Microstructure
   images are described using a compact descriptor called the
   nearest-neighbor conditional orientation correlation function, defined
   as the probability density of occurrence of a crystal orientation at one
   pixel distance from a known orientation. The neighborhood information
   obtained from this function is used to correct a Taylor-based
   formulation of crystal plasticity. A finite differencing scheme is
   developed to capture equilibrium of each orientation in an average
   sense. The predictions of textures and stresses using our approach are
   compared against crystal plasticity finite element model of a planar
   polycrystalline microstructure. We find that the new descriptor is able
   to capture texture components that are otherwise missed by the Taylor
   model and provides consistent improvements in the prediction of
   reorientation and stresses. The simulation speed is significantly faster
   than crystal plasticity finite element method and is more comparable to
   that of Taylor models. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Oxide dispersion strengthened ferritic/martensitic alloys have attracted
   significant attention for their potential uses in future nuclear
   reactors and storage vessels, as the metal/oxide interfaces act as
   stable high-strength sinks for point defects while also dispersing
   helium. Here, in order to unravel the evolution and interplay of
   interface structure and chemistry upon irradiation in these types of
   materials, an atomically sharp FeCr/MgO interface was synthesized at 500
   degrees C and separately annealed and irradiated with Ni3+ ions at 500
   degrees C. After annealing, a slight enrichment of Cr atoms was observed
   at the interface, but no other structural changes were found. However,
   under irradiation, sufficient Cr diffuses across the interface into the
   MgO to form a Cr-enriched transition layer that contains spinel
   precipitates. First-principles calculations indicate that it is
   energetically favorable to incorporate Cr, but not Fe, substitutionally
   into MgO. Our results indicate that irradiation can be used to form new
   phases and complexions at interfaces, which may have different radiation
   tolerance than the pristine structures. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on

   using a white phosphor light-emitting diode to study the effects of
   input spectra and illuminance on performance. The Al0.2Ga0.8As cells
   demonstrated the highest performance with a power conversion efficiency
   of 21\%, with open-circuit voltages >0.65 V under low lighting
   conditions. The GaAs and Al0.2Ga0.8As cells each provide a power density

Title = {{Motion Data-Driven Biomechanical Analysis during Construction Tasks on
   Sites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are one of the major
   health issues that workers frequently experience due to awkward postures
   or forceful exertions during construction tasks. Among available job
   analysis methods, biomechanical models have been widely applied to
   assess musculoskeletal risks that may contribute to the development of
   WMSDs based on motion data during occupational tasks. Recently, with the
   advent of vision-based motion capture approaches, it has become possible
   to collect the motion data required for biomechanical analysis under
   real conditions. However, vision-based motion capture approaches have
   not been applied to biomechanical analysis because of compatibility
   issues in body models of the motion data and computerized biomechanical
   analysis tools. To address this issue, automated data processing is
   focused on to convert motion data into available data in existing
   biomechanical analysis tools, given the BVH motion data from
   vision-based approaches. To examine the feasibility of the proposed
   motion data processing, an experiment for both static and dynamic
   biomechanical analyses was conducted on lifting tasks. The results
   indicate that vision-based motion capture data-converted as proposed in
   this paper-can provide a sufficient level of detail on human kinematics
   to conduct biomechanical analysis, thus allowing for the identification
   of particular body parts where excessive forces are placed during tasks.
   The issues and directions of future research are also discussed to
   perform on-site biomechanical analysis during construction tasks. (C)

   Perception of Sustainable Retrofits}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Alignment among building stakeholders is necessary to ensure that
   sustainable retrofits achieve the purpose of maximizing economic,
   environmental, and social value of the building. However, dynamic
   stakeholder opinions and value maximization perceptions result in
   conflicting requirements that hinder the adoption of truly sustainable
   retrofit decision. This paper uses an agent-based model to understand
   how social network interactions can help stakeholders with different
   characteristics prioritize their values on cost awareness, energy
   saving, and organizational performance to ultimately come up with an
   optimal retrofit decision for a commercial office building. Experimental
   analysis is used to qualitatively validate the model against results
   from other studies in literature. The results indicate that highly
   connected network structures can facilitate the interaction between the
   stakeholders to achieve alignment. In addition, networks with highly
   confident stakeholders typically hinder agreement, whereas those with
   stakeholders that have similar perceptions of values and moderate
   confidence levels can significantly facilitate alignment and
   polarization of stakeholders towards a unified retrofit objective. (C)

Abstract = {{We have used molecular statics in conjunction with an embedded atom
   method to explore the interplay between native point defects (vacancies
   and self-interstitials (SIAs)) and a low-angle grain boundary (GB) in
   bcc tungsten. The low-angle GB has biased absorption of SIAs over
   vacancies. We emphasize the significance of phenomena such as vacancy
   delocalization and SIA instant absorption around the GB dislocation
   cores in stabilizing the defect structures. Interstitial loading into
   the GB can dramatically enhance the interaction strength between the
   point defects and the GB due to SIA clustering (SIA cloud formation) or
   SIA vacancy recombination. We propose that the `maximum atom
   displacement' can complement the `vacancy formation energy' in
   evaluating unstable vacancy sites. Calculations of point defect
   migration barriers in the vicinity of GB dislocation cores show that
   vacancies and SIAs preferentially migrate along the pathways in the
   planes immediately above and below the core, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A new spray-applied fire-resistive material (SFRM) that combines the
   desirable thermal insulation property, sprayability, lightweightness and
   enhanced mechanical property is developed adopting Engineered
   Cementitious Composite (ECC) technology, overcoming the lack of
   durability issue of conventional brittle SFRM. The newly developed
   spray-applied fire-resistive ECC (SFR-ECC) exhibits density as low as
   550 kg/m(3) yet with tensile strength of 0.87 MPa and tensile strain
   capacity of 1\% when spray-applied, significantly higher than those of
   conventional SFRM with tensile strength of less than 0.1 MPa and no
   inelastic tensile strain. The newly developed material also exhibit
   significantly higher adhesion to steel than conventional SFRM. The
   thermal conductivity and sprayability of SFR-ECC are measured to be
   comparable to conventional SFRM, which ensures the proper functioning of
   SFR-ECC. SFR-ECC with enhanced mechanical performance is expected to
   improve the overall fire safety of steel structure under both service
   and extreme loads. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This work addresses some fundamental questions in the area of partially
   premixed combustion what parameters control the fraction of flamelets
   that are premixed (versus non-premixed), and what are the locations of
   high probability of premixed (versus non-premixed) combustion? To answer
   these questions there is a need to measure the flame index (xi) and its
   statistical properties, and this information previously has not been
   available. Flame index is +1 where a premixed flamelet exists and is -1
   at the location of a non-premixed flamelet A new method to measure flame
   index was developed that adds NO2 to the air; acetone is used as one
   component of the fuel. Laser-induced fluorescence images indicate the
   locations of flamelets and whether the gradients of the fuel and O-2 are
   in the same direction or not. Flame index was measured in a gas turbine
   model combustor that was designed at DLR that is a good example of
   partially premixed combustion.
   Measurements show how the mean flame index varies in space; near the
   fuel injector the combustion is 50\% non-premixed and 50\% premixed
   while downstream the flamelets are mostly premixed. This trend is
   consistent with two numerical simulations of swirl flames; however for
   simple lifted jet flames the premixed flamelets do not extend so far
   downstream. It was found that one parameter that controls the fraction
   of flamelets that are premixed is the ratio of the fuel injection
   velocity to the air velocity. Increasing this ratio increases the
   fraction of flamelets that are premixed because it increases the
   distance that the fuel stream penetrates into the more intense mixing
   region. Good signal-to-noise ratios of 24 (for acetone) and 13 (for NO2)
   were achieved and an uncertainty analysis is presented that is based on
   calibration experiments. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The problem of bounding the reliability function of a multiple access
   channel (MAC) is studied. Two new upper bounds on the error exponent of
   a two-user discrete memoryless (DM)-MAC are derived. The first bound
   (sphere packing) is an upper bound on the exponent of the average
   probability of error and is the first bound of this type that is zero
   outside the capacity region and thus results in a tighter sphere-packing
   exponent when compared with the tightest known exponent derived by
   Haroutunian. The second bound (minimum distance) is an upper bound on
   the exponent of the maximal (as opposed to average) probability of
   error. To obtain this bound, first, an upper bound on the minimum
   Bhattacharyya distance between codeword pairs is derived. For a certain
   class of two-user DM-MACs, an upper bound on the exponent of maximal
   probability of error is derived as a consequence of the upper bound on
   the minimum Bhattacharyya distance. We analytically evaluate the sphere
   packing bound for uniform composition codes for an additive and
   nonsymmetric channel and show that it is tight near the boundary of the
   capacity region, i.e., equal to the random coding lower bound.}},

Abstract = {{Frost heave and thaw settlement are the cause of substantial damage to
   infrastructure in regions of seasonal freezing as well as seasonal
   thawing (permafrost). While frost heaving of soils has been researched
   for decades, less attention has been paid to quantitative estimates of
   settlement and loss of strength of soils due to thawing. A constitutive
   model is developed, capable of simulating freezing and thawing of soils,
   and associated changes in the soil strength. While the porosity growth
   parameters describing frost heaving have been calibrated and validated
   for a specific soil, the description of the thawing phase has not been
   validated due to a lack of experimental data. The yielding of the frozen
   soil is described using the critical state concept, with the pore ice
   content being an important parameter affecting the yield function. The
   model was calibrated using available laboratory test data and used in
   the simulation of a freezing-thawing cycle in the soil with embedded
   footing. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the development and characterization of the
   synergistic smart morphing aileron concept, which leverages the
   properties of two different smart material actuators to achieve
   performance that exceeds that of the constituent materials. Utilizing
   the relatively higher work density and phase transformation of shape
   memory alloys combined with the larger bandwidth and conformal bending
   of bonded piezoelectric macro-fiber composites, the resultant
   synergistic morphing design improves the range of static tip
   deflections, enabling the capability to hold more trim positions over
   long timescales while still quickly compensating for dynamic loading. By
   commanding an input of full-range square waves of 0.01-10 Hz to the
   actuators, first-order time responses were measured and characterized
   using a common methodology by tracking a relative time constant. Using
   this method, aeroelastic effects for each actuator and the combined
   system were characterized in a wind tunnel at 0 degrees angle of attack
   with flow speeds ranging from 0 to 15 m/s. This novel approach
   characterized a large-deflection morphing actuation system with multiple
   smart materials operating over different timescales. The combined system
   achieved additive amplitude while tracking the faster actuation response
   of the macro-fiber composite between 0.1 and 1 Hz.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the growth of interface perturbations
   following the interaction of a shock wave with successive layers of
   fluids. Using the Discontinuous Galerkin method, we solve the
   two-dimensional multifluid Euler equations. In our setup, a shock
   impacts up to four adjacent fluids with perturbed interfaces. At each
   interface, the incoming shock generates reflected and transmitted shocks
   and rarefactions, which further interact with the interfaces. By
   monitoring perturbation growth, we characterize the influence these
   instabilities have on each other and the fluid mixing as a function of
   time in different configurations. If the third gas is lighter than the
   second, the reflected rarefaction at the second interface amplifies the
   growth at the first interface. If the third gas is heavier, the
   reflected shock decreases the growth and tends to reverse the
   Richtmyer-Meshkov instability as the thickness of the second gas is
   increased. We further investigate the effect of the reflected waves on
   the dynamics of the small scales and show how a phase difference between
   the perturbations or an additional fluid layer can enhance growth. This
   study supports the idea that shocks and rarefactions can be used to

Title = {{Dynamics and Control of Spacecraft With a Generalized Model of Variable

Abstract = {{The attitude dynamics model for a spacecraft with a variable speed
   control moment gyroscope (VSCMG) is derived using the principles of
   variational mechanics. The resulting dynamics model is obtained in the
   framework of geometric mechanics, relaxing some of the assumptions made
   in prior literature on control moment gyroscopes (CMGs). These
   assumptions include symmetry of the rotor and gimbal structure, and no
   offset between the centers of mass of the gimbal and the rotor. The
   dynamics equations show the complex nonlinear coupling between the
   internal degrees-of-freedom associated with the VSCMG and the spacecraft
   base body's rotational degrees-of-freedom. This dynamics model is then
   further generalized to include the effects of multiple VSCMGs placed in
   the spacecraft base body, and sufficient conditions for nonsingular
   VSCMG configurations are obtained. General ideas on control of the
   angular momentum of the spacecraft using changes in the momentum
   variables of a finite number of VSCMGs are provided. A control scheme
   using a finite number of VSCMGs for attitude stabilization maneuvers in
   the absence of external torques and when the total angular momentum of
   the spacecraft is zero is presented. The dynamics model of the
   spacecraft with a finite number of VSCMGs is then simplified under the
   assumptions that there is no offset between the centers of mass of the
   rotor and gimbal, and the rotor is axisymmetric. As an example, the case
   of three VSCMGs with axisymmetric rotors, placed in a tetrahedron
   configuration inside the spacecraft, is considered. The control scheme
   is then numerically implemented using a geometric variational integrator
   (GVI). Numerical simulation results with zero and nonzero rotor offset
   between centers of mass of gimbal and rotor are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by a grain boundary (GB) healing mechanism that GB turns into
   a mobile sink through migration to eliminate the vacancies in a bulk, we
   have further investigated the influence of the retained hydrogen (H) on
   the GB migration in tungsten using a molecular dynamics simulation. We
   show that H hinders the GB migration at different H concentrations and
   temperatures, and such friction of GB migration due to the presence of H
   increases with the H concentration and decreases with temperature. We
   demonstrate that H follows the GB-migration as the temperature is higher
   than 300 K. Most importantly, the presence of H induces a disordering of
   GB, which affects the GB migration significantly.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS B-FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{206-216}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the influence of directionality on intermediate- and
   deep-water (kh = 1.09-3.49) wave breaking, an elaborately designed
   physical experiment was conducted in an `X' configuration, where two
   identical two-dimensional wave trains were generated and propagated with
   an approach angle of 8 degrees (i.e. a weakly three-dimensional
   configuration) and encountered each other in an interaction region. The
   study involved measuring the wave surface elevations using calibrated
   wave gauges along the channels as well as recording the variation of the
   surface elevations spatially using video in the vicinity of the
   interaction region. In addition, for direct comparison a two-dimensional
   experiment was also conducted in one of the channels with the `X'
   configuration essentially removed by a dummy wall in the interaction
   region. The experimental results show that the weakly three-dimensional
   experiments have little influence on the profile of wave trains with
   relatively low initial steepness (S-0 = 0.215. S-0 = k(s) Sigma a(n),
   where k(s) is the wave number corresponding to the spectrally weighted
   wave frequency, and a(n) is the wave amplitude of the nth wave
   component), although it is pronounced when breaking occurs. In addition,
   the frequency spectra of the focusing waves illustrate that the
   interaction of two wave trains increases the energy in the 0.91 < f/f(p)
   < 1.82 band for non-breaking cases and dissipates the energy from the
   higher frequency end for breaking cases. Compared with the
   two-dimensional experiment, it is noted that due to directional
   wave-wave interaction, breaking events could occur with smaller initial
   steepness and, more interestingly, with lower energy dissipation. It is
   somewhat surprising that the breaking dissipation was reduced. We
   noticed a shift in focusing/breaking location (i.e. premature) due to
   the increase in crest height using linear focusing theory, which was
   more pronounced during directional wave-wave interaction. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents the experimental results pertaining to the

   strain measurement system ARAMIS was used to obtain the complete
   non-uniform strain and displacement fields of the damaged face-sheet.
   Consequently, damage in the face-sheets was characterized by
   fractography. It has been found that the dominant damage mechanism is
   kink band in the impacted face-sheets due to fiber plastic
   micro-buckling. Besides, the effects of impactor diameter, impact
   energy, face-sheet thickness and foam core thickness on the residual

Abstract = {{This paper presents a wave-based, analytical method for the computation
   of power transfer coefficients (PTC) to evaluate vibratory power
   transmitted through a set of angled structural joints that connects an
   arbitrary number of composite plates. Each joint is only used to hold
   two adjacent plates together. The elastic wave motions and dispersion
   properties of the plate are calculated by considering shear deformation,
   rotary inertia, and material anisotropy. The joint is modeled with
   stiffness and damping in both translational and rotational directions,
   and the joint parameters are allowed to differ from one joint to
   another. The equilibrium conditions at the joint set are derived to
   solve for the complex amplitude of waves propagating away from it. From
   the PTCs computed for a particular angle of wave incidence at the
   junction, the diffuse-field PTCs are calculated using weighted integral
   of the incidence angle. A comparison with published numerical results
   for simpler configurations has been performed in order to validate some
   key aspects of the present analytical formulation. Several numerical
   examples of two coupled composite sandwich panels are considered to
   compute PTCs, through which it is clearly demonstrated that the joint
   compliance and damping as well as the transverse shear deformation and
   rotary inertia of composite sandwich panels influence the vibratory
   power transmission through coupled composite plates.}},

Abstract = {{In a number of nickel-based superalloy systems strengthened by gamma
   prime (gamma'), eta-phase (Ni3Ti, eta) forms during prolonged
   high-temperature exposure, but its effect on mechanical properties is
   not well characterized. Using thermodynamic modeling and
   design-of-experiments techniques, three modifications of the
   nickel-based superalloy Nimonic (Nimonic(A (R)) is a trademark of
   Special Metals Corporation group of companies.) 263 were identified that
   yield increased volume fractions of the eta-phase (Ni3Ti, eta) at
   temperatures above 1023 K (750 A degrees C). Volume fractions of
   eta-phase were evaluated for each alloy and heat-treatment condition
   using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy
   dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Compared to Nimonic 263,
   small additions of V and Ta were found to increase the volume fraction
   of eta-phase above 1023 K (750 A degrees C) from approximately 5 pct to
   above 15 pct, thus providing a route for future mechanical behavior
   experimental studies, which was not in the scope of this work.}},

   temperature uniaxial straining. The material was examined in as-molded,
   as-rolled, and rolled + annealed conditions. The yield strength and work
   hardening behavior are controlled primarily by grain size and
   crystallographic texture, which reaches a maximum of only 4.8 multiples
   of random density in the as-rolled material. The low degree of texture
   results in a low degree of plastic anisotropy (Lankford r value),
   suggesting good formability properties. In addition, it is shown that
   although the beta-phase particles begin to crack as early as 4 pct
   elongation, their presence does not lead to a decrease in ductility, as
   beta-phase cracks do not coalesce to initiate fracture.}},

Abstract = {{The density-functional theory and phase-field dislocation model have
   been used to compute and simulate the strength of theta' plates and
   precipitate-dislocation interactions in an Al-4Cu-0.05Sn (wt pct) alloy
   that is strengthened exclusively by coherent theta' precipitate plates.
   The density-functional theory computation indicates that a 1.06 GPa
   applied stress is required for a dislocation to shear through a theta'
   plate, which is far larger than the critical resolved shear stress
   increment (Delta CRSS) of the peak-aged sample of the alloy. The Delta
   CRSS values of the alloy aged for 0.5, 3, 48, and 168 hours at 473 K
   (200 A degrees C) are computed by the phase-field dislocation model, and
   they agree well with experimental data. The phase-field simulations
   suggest that the Delta CRSS value increases with an increase in plate
   aspect ratio and number density, and that the change of Delta CRSS is
   not sensitive to the variation of the distribution of theta' plate
   diameters when the average diameter of theta' plates is fixed, and that
   the coherency strain of theta' plates does not contribute much to Delta
   CRSS of the alloy when the theta' number density and aspect ratio are
   below certain values. The simulations further suggest that, when the
   volume fraction of theta' is constant, the Delta CRSS value for a random
   spatial distribution of the theta' plates is 0.78 times of that for a
   regular spatial distribution. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials

Abstract = {{We describe a highly optimized implementation of MPI domain
   decomposition in a GPU-enabled, general-purpose molecular dynamics code,
   HOOMD-blue (Anderson and Glotzer, 2013). Our approach is inspired by a
   traditional CPU-based code, LAMMPS (Plimpton, 1995), but is implemented
   within a code that was designed for execution on GPUs from the start
   (Anderson et al., 2008). The software supports short-ranged pair force
   and bond force fields and achieves optimal GPU performance using an
   autotuning algorithm. We are able to demonstrate equivalent or superior
   scaling on up to 3375 GPUs in Lennard-Jones and dissipative particle
   dynamics (DPD) simulations of up to 108 million particles. GPUDirect
   RDMA capabilities in recent GPU generations provide better performance
   in full double precision calculations. For a representative polymer
   physics application, HOOMD-blue 1.0 provides an effective GPU vs. CPU
   node speed-up of 12.5x. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, nonlinear free vibration analysis of simply-supported
   nanoscale beams incorporating surface effects, i.e. surface elasticity,
   surface tension and surface density, is studied using the nonlocal
   elasticity within the frame work of Euler Bernoulli beam theory with von
   karman type nonlinearity. A linear variation for the component of the
   bulk stress, sigma(zz), through the nanobeam thickness is used to
   satisfy the balance conditions between the nanobeam bulk and its
   surfaces. An exact analytical solution to the governing equation of
   motion is presented for natural frequencies of nanobeams using elliptic
   integrals. The effect of the nanobeam length, thickness to length ratio,
   mode number, amplitude of deflection to radius of gyration ratio and
   nonlocal parameter on the normalized natural frequencies of aluminum and
   silicon nanobeams with positive and negative surface elasticity,
   respectively, is investigated. It is observed that the surface effects
   increase natural frequencies of the aluminum nanobeam for all values of
   the amplitude ratio and the silicon nanobeam at low amplitude ratios
   while at higher amplitude ratios the surface effects decrease the
   natural frequencies of the silicon nanobeam. Also, for all values of
   amplitude ratios, the normalized fundamental natural frequencies of
   silicon and aluminum nanobeams vary linearly with respect to the
   nonlocal parameter while this is not the case at higher mode numbers.

Abstract = {{As the capacity of wind turbines has increased, the loads on crucial
   components such as a gearbox, a generator, and blades are significantly
   increasing. An intelligent online monitoring system is indispensable to
   protect the excessive load on core components and manage a wind farm
   efficiently. In order to verify new online monitoring and diagnostic
   methods for such a monitoring system in advance, a wind turbine
   simulator is essential. For this purpose, we developed a simulator that
   has similar dynamics to an actual 3 MW wind turbine, and is thereby able
   to acquire a state of operation that closely resembles that of the 3 MW
   wind turbine under a variety of wind conditions.
   This paper describes the implementation of a torque and a collective
   pitch controller, which is used for a new type of simulator with the
   intention of exploiting online monitoring and diagnostic methods. The
   torque and the collective pitch controllers were developed to facilitate
   variable speed-variable pitch control strategies in the wind turbine
   simulator. Experiments demonstrated that three control regions were
   successfully deployed on the simulator, and thereby the simulator was
   operated at all control regions in a stable and accurate manner.
   Moreover, the strain and vibration measured from the blade and the
   gearbox showed different trends at three control regions. Therefore, a
   new type of simulator is an effective means to develop diagnostic and
   prognostic algorithms as well as online monitoring methods reflecting
   the dependency of dynamic characteristics on the control regions. (C)

Abstract = {{To simplify signal analysis on wind turbine blades and enable their
   efficient monitoring, this paper presents a novel method of transforming
   blade moment signals on a horizontal axis 3-blade wind turbine. Instead
   of processing 3-blade moment signals directly, the proposed algorithm
   transforms the three sinusoidal signals into two static signals relative
   to the center of blade rotation through vector synthesis and coordinate
   transformation, and eliminates frequency components due to blade
   rotation from the obtained signals. Moreover, as an alternative to a
   rotational sensor, a blade rotation angle estimator is introduced. Its
   effectiveness was confirmed through simulations and field tests on an
   actual wind turbine.

Abstract = {{The Fisher information matrix (FIM) is a foundational concept in
   statistical signal processing. The FIM depends on the probability
   distribution, assumed to belong to a smooth parametric family.
   Traditional approaches to estimating the FIM require estimating the
   probability distribution function (PDF), or its parameters, along with
   its gradient or Hessian. However, in many practical situations the PDF
   of the data is not known but the statistician has access to an
   observation sample for any parameter value. Here we propose a method of
   estimating the FIM directly from sampled data that does not require
   knowledge of the underlying PDF. The method is based on non-parametric
   estimation of an f-divergence over a local neighborhood of the parameter
   space and a relation between curvature of the f-divergence and the FIM.
   Thus we obtain an empirical estimator of the FIM that does not require
   density estimation and is asymptotically consistent. We empirically
   evaluate the validity of our approach using two experiments.}},

   conformation capture and 3D imaging, and function using RNA-sequencing.
   We introduce a quantitative index that measures underlying topological
   stability of a genomic region. Our results show that structural features
   of genomic regions correlate with function with surprising persistence
   over time. Furthermore, constructing genome-wide gene-level contact maps
   aided in identifying gene pairs with high potential for coregulation and
   colocalization in a manner consistent with expression via transcription
   factories. We additionally use 2D phase planes to visualize patterns in
   4DN data. Finally, we evaluated gene pairs within a circadian gene
   module using 3D imaging, and found periodicity in the movement of clock
   circadian regulator and period circadian clock 2 relative to each other
   that followed a circadian rhythm and entrained with their expression.}},

Abstract = {{A temperature-compensated silicon micromechanical resonator with a
   quadratic temperature characteristic is realized by acoustic
   engineering. Energy-trapped resonance modes are synthesized by acoustic
   coupling of propagating and evanescent extensional waves in waveguides
   with rectangular cross section. Highly different temperature sensitivity
   of propagating and evanescent waves is used to engineer the linear
   temperature coefficient of frequency. The resulted quadratic temperature
   characteristic has a well-defined turn-over temperature that can be
   tailored by relative energy distribution between propagating and
   evanescent acoustic fields. A 76MHz prototype is implemented in single
   crystal silicon. Two high quality factor and closely spaced resonance
   modes, created from efficient energy trapping of extensional waves, are
   excited through thin aluminum nitride film. Having different evanescent
   wave constituents and energy distribution across the device, these modes
   show different turn over points of 67 degrees C and 87 degrees C for
   their quadratic temperature characteristic. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Size-dependent mechanical properties of Mg nanoparticles used for
   hydrogen storage}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{26}},
Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{Magnesium (Mg) hydride is a promising hydrogen storage material, yet its
   application has been limited by the slow hydrogen sorption kinetics.
   Recently, Mg nanoparticles have shown significant improvement of
   hydrogen storage properties in terms of dimensional stability upon
   cycling with the trend that the smaller the particle, the better the
   sorption kinetics. Since the volume change during sorption generates
   stress, leading to plastic deformation, the fundamentals of the
   mechanical deformation of the Mg particles are a significant issue. By
   using in situ transmission electron microscope compression tests and
   atomistic simulations on Mg nanoparticles, it was observed that
   deformation in the larger particles was dominated by the nucleation of
   hai-type dislocations from stress concentrations at the contact surface,
   while the smaller particles deformed more homogeneously with greater
   distribution of multiple types of dislocation sources. Importantly, this
   improvement of plastic deformation with decrease in size is
   orientation-independent. First-principles calculations suggest that this
   improved plasticity can be explained by the nearly-isotropic ideal shear
   strength for Mg, which becomes more important in smaller nanoparticles.
   As a result, the smaller Mg nanoparticles demonstrated better plastic
   stability to accommodate volume change upon hydrogen storage cycling.

Abstract = {{Here we report the development of a new cationic liposome-hyaluronic
   acid (HA) hybrid nanoparticle (NP) system and present our
   characterization of these NPs as an intranasal vaccine platform using a
   model antigen and F1-V, a candidate recombinant antigen for Yersinia
   pestis, the causative agent of plague. Incubation of cationic liposomes
   composed of DOTAP and DOPE with anionic HA biopolymer led to efficient
   ionic complexation and formation of homogenous liposome-polymer hybrid
   NPs, as evidenced by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, dynamic
   light scattering, and nanoparticle tracking analyses. Incorporation of
   cationic liposomes with thiolated HA allowed for facile surface
   decoration of NPs with thiol-PEG, resulting in the formation of DOTAP/HA
   core-PEG shell nanostructures. These NPs, termed DOTAP-HA NPs, exhibited
   improved colloidal stability and prolonged antigen release. In addition,
   cytotoxicity associated with DOTAP liposomes (LC50 similar to 0.2 mg/ml)
   was significantly reduced by at least 20-fold with DOTAP-HA NPs (LC50 >
   4 mg/ml), as measured with bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs).
   Furthermore, NPs co-loaded with ovalbumin (OVA) and a molecular
   adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) promoted BMDC maturation and
   upregulation of co-stimulatory markers, including CD40, CD86, and
   MHC-II, and C57BL/6 mice vaccinated with NPs via intranasal route
   generated robust OVA-specific CD8(+) T cell and antibody responses.
   Importantly, intranasal vaccination with NPs co-loaded with F1-V and
   MPLA induced potent humoral immune responses with 11-, 23-, and 15-fold
   increases in F1-V-specific total IgG, IgG(1), and IgG(2c) titers in
   immune sera by day 77, respectively, and induced balanced Th1/Th2
   humoral immune responses, whereas mice immunized with the equivalent
   doses of soluble F1-V vaccine failed to achieve sero-conversion.
   Overall, these results suggest that liposome-polymer hybrid NPs may
   serve as a promising vaccine delivery platform for intranasal
   vaccination against Y. pestis and other infectious pathogens. (C) 2015

Title = {{Effect of Variation in hemorheology between human and animal blood on
   the binding efficacy of vascular-targeted carriers}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Animal models are extensively used to evaluate the in vivo functionality
   of novel drug delivery systems (DDS). However, many variations likely
   exist in vivo between the animals and human physiological environment
   that significantly alter results obtained with animal models relative to
   human system. To date, it is not clear if the variation in hemorheology
   and hemodynamics between common animal and human models affect the
   functionality of DDS. This study investigates the role of hemorheology
   of humans and various animal models in dictating the binding efficiency
   of model vascular-targeted carriers (VTCs) to the wall in physiological
   blood flows. Specifically, the adhesion of sLeA-coated nano-and
   micro-spheres to inflamed endothelial cells monolayers were conducted
   via a parallel plate flow chamber assay with steady and disturbed red
   blood cells (RBCs)-in-buffer and whole blood flows of common animal
   models. Our results suggest that the ratio of carrier size to RBC size
   dictate particle binding in blood flow. Additionally, the presence of
   white blood cells affects the trend of particle adhesion depending on
   the animal species. Overall, this work sheds light on some deviation in
   VTC vascular wall interaction results obtained with in vivo animal
   experimentation from expected outcome and efficiency in vivo in human.}},

Title = {{In vivo estimation of perineal body properties using ultrasound

Abstract = {{Objective: The perineal body must undergo a remarkable transformation
   during pregnancy to accommodate an estimated stretch ratio of over 3.3
   in order to permit vaginal delivery of the fetal head. Yet measurements
   of perineal body elastic properties are lacking in vivo, whether in the
   pregnant or nonpregnant state. The objective of this study, therefore,
   was to develop a method for measuring perineal body elastic modulus and
   to test its feasibility in young nulliparous women.
   Methods: An UltraSONIX RP500 ultrasound system was equipped with
   elastography software. Approximately 1 Hz free-hand sinusoidal
   compression loading of the perineum was used to measure the relative
   stiffness of the perineal body compared to that of a custom reference
   standoff pad with a modulus of 36.7 kPa. Measurements were made in 20
   healthy nulliparous women. Four subjects were invited back for second
   and third visits to evaluate within- and between-visit repeatability
   using the coefficient of variation.
   Results: The mean +/- SD elastic compression modulus of the perineal
   body was 28.9 +/- 4.7 kPa. Within- and between-visit repeatability
   averaged 3.4\% and 83\%, respectively.
   Conclusion: Ultrasound elastography using a standoff pad reference
   provides a valid method for evaluating the elastic modulus of the
   perineal body in living women. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A multi-compartment 3-D finite element model of rectocele and its

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},

Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{9, SI}},
Pages = {{1580-1586}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{We developed a subject-specific 3-D finite element model to understand
   the mechanics underlying formation of female pelvic organ prolapse,
   specifically a rectocele and its interaction with a cystocele. The model
   was created from MRI 3-D geometry of a healthy 45 year-old multiparous
   woman. It included anterior and posterior vaginal walls, levator ani
   muscle, cardinal and uterosacral ligaments, anterior and posterior arcus
   tendineus fascia pelvis, arcus tendineus levator ani, perineal body,
   perineal membrane and anal sphincter. Material properties were mostly
   from the literature. Tissue impairment was modeled as decreased tissue
   stiffness based on previous clinical studies. Model equations were
   solved using Abaqus v 6.11. The sensitivity of anterior and posterior
   vaginal wall geometry was calculated for different combinations tissue
   impairments under increasing intraabdominal pressure. Prolapse size was
   reported as pelvic organ prolapse quantification system (POP-Q) point at
   point Bp for rectocele and point Ba for cystocele. Results show that a
   rectocele resulted from impairments of the levator ani and posterior
   compartment support. For 20\% levator and 85\% posterior support
   impairments, simulated rectocele size (at POP-Q point: Bp) increased
   0.29 mm/cm H2O without apical impairment and 0.36 mm/cm H2O with 60\%
   apical impairment, as intraabdominal pressures increased from 0 to 150
   cm H2O. Apical support impairment could result in the development of
   either a cystocele or rectocele. Simulated repair of posterior
   compartment support decreased rectocele but increased a preexisting
   cystocele. We conclude that development of rectocele and cystocele
   depend on the presence of anterior, posterior, levator and/or or apical
   support impairments, as well as the interaction of the prolapse with the
   opposing compartment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based conjugated polymer PDTDPPQT was
   synthesized and was used to perform epitaxial polymer crystal growth on
   removable 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene crystallite templates. A thin-film
   transistor (TFT) was successfully fabricated in well-grown large
   spherulites of PDTDPPQT. The charge carrier mobility along the radial
   direction of the spherulites was measured to be 5.46-12.04 cm(2) V-1
   s(-1), which is significantly higher than that in the direction
   perpendicular to the radial direction. The dynamic response of charge
   transport was also investigated by applying a pulsed bias to TFTs loaded
   with a resistor (similar to 20 M Omega). The charge-transport behaviors
   along the radial direction and perpendicular to the radial direction
   were investigated by static and dynamic experiments through a
   resistor-loaded (RL) inverter. The RL inverter made of PDTDPPQT-based
   TFT operates well, maintaining a fairly high switching voltage ratio
   (V-out(ON)/V-out(OFF)) at a relatively high frequency when the
   source-drain electrodes are aligned parallel to the radial direction.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoindentation measurements of the elastic moduli E-r of thin polymer
   films supported by stiff substrates with moduli E-s >> E-r show an
   increase of Er with decreasing h, for h less than a threshold thickness
   h(t). In the thickness range h < h(t), the value of the modulus
   manifests the influence of various interactions associated with the
   ``stiff{''} substrate. We show that h, is a function of composition for
   the miscible blend of polystyrene (PS) and tetramethyl bisphenol-A
   polycarbonate (TMPC). The modulus E-r,(TMPC) of TMPC films supported by
   SiOx increases for h < h(t)(TMPC) similar to 300 nm while h(t)(PS)
   similar to 450 nm for the modulus E-r,E-PS of PS films, supported by the
   same substrate. The threshold thicknesses of the blends and the moduli
   of the blends appear to be reasonably described by an effective medium
   approximation. This behavior is rationalized in terms of the vibrational
   force constants f, determined using incoherent neutron scattering
   experiments, of the materials.}},

Abstract = {{Linear viscoelastic G' and G `' master curves for linear, star, H, and
   comb 1,4-polybutadienes from the literature are compared and found to
   agree well in the transition frequency region, where G' and G `' exceed
   the plateau modulus, irrespective of molecular weight and branching
   structures. A value of tau(e) = (3-.7 +/- 0.93) x 10(-7) s for the
   equilibration time at T = 25 degrees C can therefore-be determined from
   fitting Rouse predictions to the transition frequency data, after
   subtracting effects of glassy modes represented by the
   Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) expression. Good agreement among
   multiple data sets was obtained in the transition region despite large
   variations in low-temperature shift factors, evidently due to small
   sample-to-sample variations in 1,2 content. These variations in 1,2
   content can also cause small changes the plateau modulus G(N)(0), and
   the entanglement molecular weight M-e, which should have only a small
   effect On linear polymers but for long-chain branched polymers could
   lead to large variations in terminal relaxation time predicted by tube
   models. The small variations in G(N)(0) can, however, be inferred from
   the dependence of shift factor on temperature, allowing all three tube
   model parameters tau(e), G(N)(0), and M-e to be Obtained from
   high-frequency data for 1,4-polybutadienes, thus in principle removing
   these as parameters that can be adjusted to fit specific data sets for
   linear or branched 1,4-polybutadienes.}},

Abstract = {{Self-limited, or terminal, supraparticles have long received great
   interest because of their abundance in biological systems (DNA bundles
   and virus capsids) and their potential use in a host of applications
   ranging from photonics and catalysis to encapsulation for drug delivery.
   Moreover, soft, uniform colloidal aggregates are a promising candidate
   for quasicrystal and other hierarchical assemblies. In this work, we
   present a generic coarse-grained model that captures the formation of
   self-limited assemblies observed in various soft-matter systems
   including nanoparticles, colloids, and polyelectrolytes. Using molecular
   dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the assembly process is
   self-limited when the repulsion between the particles is renormalized to
   balance their attraction during aggregation. The uniform finite-sized
   aggregates are further shown to be thermodynamically stable and tunable
   with a single dimensionless parameter. We find large aggregates
   self-organize internally into a core-shell morphology and exhibit
   anomalous uniformity when the constituent nanoparticles have a
   polydisperse size distribution.}},

Title = {{A predictive machine learning approach for microstructure optimization
   and materials design}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses an important materials engineering question: How
   can one identify the complete space (or as much of it as possible) of
   microstructures that are theoretically predicted to yield the desired
   combination of properties demanded by a selected application? We present
   a problem involving design of magnetoelastic Fe-Ga alloy microstructure
   for enhanced elastic, plastic and magnetostrictive properties. While
   theoretical models for computing properties given the microstructure are
   known for this alloy, inversion of these relationships to obtain
   microstructures that lead to desired properties is challenging,
   primarily due to the high dimensionality of microstructure space,
   multi-objective design requirement and non-uniqueness of solutions.
   These challenges render traditional search-based optimization methods
   incompetent in terms of both searching efficiency and result optimality.
   In this paper, a route to address these challenges using a machine
   learning methodology is proposed. A systematic framework consisting of
   random data generation, feature selection and classification algorithms
   is developed. Experiments with five design problems that involve
   identification of microstructures that satisfy both linear and nonlinear
   property constraints show that our framework outperforms traditional
   optimization methods with the average running time reduced by as much as
   80\% and with optimality that would not be achieved otherwise.}},

Abstract = {{Control of ion energy distributions (IEDs) onto the surface of wafers is
   an ongoing challenge in microelectronics fabrication. The use of
   capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs) using multiple radio frequency (rf)
   power sources provides many opportunities to customize IEDs. In
   dual-frequency CCPs using a fundamental frequency and its second
   harmonic, varying the relative voltages, powers, and phases between the
   fundamental and second harmonic biases have demonstrated potential as
   control mechanisms for the shape of the IEDs. In this paper, we report
   on computational and experimental investigations of IED control in
   dual-frequency and triple-frequency CCPs where the phase between the
   fundamental and second harmonic frequency voltage waveform is used as a
   control variable. The operating conditions were 5-40 mTorr (0.67-5.33
   Pa) in Ar and Ar/CF4/O-2 gas mixtures. By changing the phase between the
   applied rf frequency and its second harmonic, the Electrical Asymmetric
   Effects was significant and not only shifted the dc self-bias but also
   affected plasma uniformity. When changing phases of higher harmonics,
   the energies and widths of the IEDs could be controlled. With the
   addition of a 3rd high-frequency source, the plasma density increased
   and uniformity improved. Computed results for IEDs were compared with
   experimental results using an ion energy analyzer in systems using rf
   phase locked power supplies. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The development of high-capacity methane adsorbents would accelerate the
   adoption of natural gas as a vehicular fuel, thereby lowering CO2
   emissions from the combustion of gasoline. In this regard metal-organic
   frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising methane storage materials
   due to their high capacities and tunable properties. Within this class,
   HKUST-1 ({[}Cu-3(BTC)(2)](n), BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) is an
   important benchmark, as it exhibits methane densities that are among the
   highest reported. Furthermore, uptake in HKUST-1 can potentially be
   tuned by altering the methane-MOF interaction through metal substitution
   on coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS). Predicting the impact of
   metal substitution remains a challenge, however, because general
   interatomic potentials commonly used in calculating uptake do not
   properly describe interactions involving CUS. Here, a new interatomic
   potential that explicitly accounts for these interactions is derived
   from quantum-mechanical calculations. The potential reproduces both the
   measured methane isotherm for HKUST-1 and the site preference for
   adsorption at CUS. Extension to 17 metal-substituted variants confirms
   that CUS composition can dramatically alter uptake, with Ni- and
   Ca-based compounds predicted to exceed the performance of Cu-HKUST-1.
   Trends in methane uptake correlate well with elementary MOF properties
   such as surface area, adsorption energy, and the electronegativity of
   the metal site.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an improved method of constant reactive loading for
   the miniaturisation of quarter-wavelength transmission lines. The method
   provides an optimum location for loading, which maintains the electrical
   characteristics before and after miniaturisation. Therefore circuits
   based on transmission lines can be miniaturised with negligible
   deterioration in performance. This simple yet highly effective method is
   especially attractive for popular multi-section circuits, in which a
   number of sections are cascaded for wider bandwidths. Experimental
   results of various Chebyshev multi-section impedance transformers not
   only verifies the effectiveness of this method in bandwidths as large as
   99\% with a size reduction of more than 55\%, but also demonstrates the
   method's flexibility of design.}},

Title = {{Round-trip efficiency of fast demand response in a large commercial air

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},

Abstract = {{Air conditioning (AC) of large commercial buildings represents an
   attractive target for many different forms of demand response (DR)
   including DR for ancillary services (AS) such as frequency regulation.
   The operating cost of such DR is typically discussed in terms of
   occupant discomfort. However at fast timescales, perturbations to
   well-functioning building controls may increase the total energy
   consumption relative to a baseline that does not provide DR ancillary
   services (DR-AS). The extra energy is a cost of control to the asset
   owner and should be factored into the cost of providing DR-AS. We
   performed DR experiments on a similar to 30,000 m(2) office building,
   and at the 15-min time scale of these experiments, we find the extra
   energy consumption to be significant. Similar to battery energy storage,
   we express the energy cost in terms of a round-trip efficiency and use
   this metric in a simple economic analysis of the cost of frequency
   regulation from these resources and discuss potential impacts on
   advanced load management methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Evaluating the impact of extreme energy use behavior on occupancy
   interventions in commercial buildings}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{205-218}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Occupancy interventions, which are typically used to diffuse energy
   conservation practices among commercial building occupants, are showing
   promising but un-sustained energy savings. One possible explanation to
   the observed results is the presence of extreme energy users in the
   buildings who can have an important influence on their moderate peers
   and revoke the benefits of occupancy interventions. While this
   `extremism' in human behavior phenomenon has been extensively studied in
   various social science fields, it has yet to be applied on the study of
   energy conservation from occupancy interventions in commercial
   buildings. Using agent-based modeling and data from actual commercial
   buildings, this paper evaluates the influence of extreme energy users
   (1) on their peers and on the energy performance of commercial buildings
   and (2) on the effectiveness of commonly implemented occupancy
   interventions. Parametric variations and statistical analyses indicate
   that extremism can highly affect the effectiveness of traditional
   occupancy interventions. In parallel, a combination of methods has shown
   to empower moderate energy users, helping diffuse and maintain energy
   conservation practices even in the presence of extreme energy users. The
   demonstrated capability to test and optimize occupancy interventions is
   expected to support and boost their adoption in large-scale energy
   conservation initiatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Volume = {{106}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{In this letter, the authors present a semi-empirical relationship used
   to predict the velocity at which two adjacent identical cantilevers
   placed in steady cross-flow begin to experience persistent large
   amplitude vibrations at a particular combination of flow velocity and
   separation distance. This recently discovered flow-induced vibration
   phenomenon is called dual cantilever flutter (DCF). The only DCF models
   available can be used to predict time-series dynamics; however, they are
   complex and require extensive model updating procedures. The model
   proposed in this letter requires known parameters and only a single
   nondimensional empirical value called the Jd number. The Jd number was
   found to be an approximately constant single value for four case
   studies, each performed with a different cantilever design. Derivation
   of the Jd number and the flutter prediction model are discussed and
   experimentally validated. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Rapid, automated, parallel quantitative immunoassays using highly

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Immunoassays represent one of the most popular analytical methods for
   detection and quantification of biomolecules. However, conventional
   immunoassays such as ELISA and flow cytometry, even though providing
   high sensitivity and specificity and multiplexing capability, can be
   labor-intensive and prone to human error, making them unsuitable for
   standardized clinical diagnoses. Using a commercialized no-wash,
   homogeneous immunoassay technology ('AlphaLISA') in conjunction with
   integrated microfluidics, herein we developed a microfluidic immunoassay
   chip capable of rapid, automated, parallel immunoassays of microliter
   quantities of samples. Operation of the microfluidic immunoassay chip
   entailed rapid mixing and conjugation of AlphaLISA components with
   target analytes before quantitative imaging for analyte detections in up
   to eight samples simultaneously. Aspects such as fluid handling and
   operation, surface passivation, imaging uniformity, and detection
   sensitivity of the microfluidic immunoassay chip using AlphaLISA were
   investigated. The microfluidic immunoassay chip could detect one target
   analyte simultaneously for up to eight samples in 45 min with a limit of
   detection down to 10 pg mL(-1). The microfluidic immunoassay chip was
   further utilized for functional immunophenotyping to examine cytokine
   secretion from human immune cells stimulated ex vivo. Together, the
   microfluidic immunoassay chip provides a promising high-throughput,
   high-content platform for rapid, automated, parallel quantitative
   immunosensing applications.}},

Abstract = {{The (0001) sapphire samples are irradiated with 60 keV helium ions at
   the fluences of 5 x 10(16), 1 x 10(17)and 5 x 10(17) ions/cm(2) at room
   temperature. After implantation, two broad absorption bands at 320-460
   and 480-700 nm are observed and their intensities increase with the
   increasing ion fluence. The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction results
   indicate that the \{0001\} diffraction peaks of sapphire decrease and
   broaden due to the disorientation of the generated crystallites after
   ion irradiation. The microstructure evolution is examined by the
   scanning and transmission electron microscopes. The surface becomes
   rough because of the aggregation of helium bubbles and migration towards
   the surface. There is a lattice expansion up to similar to 4.5\% in the
   implanted area and the lattice distortion measured from dispersion of
   (110) diffraction is similar to 4.6 degrees. Such strain of crystal
   lattice is rather large and leads to contrast fluctuation at scale of
   1-2 nm (the bubble size). The laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) is
   investigated to understand the effect of helium ion beam irradiation on
   the laser damage resistance of sapphire components and the results show
   that the LIDT decreases from 5.4 to 2.5 J/cm(2) due to the absorptive
   color centers, helium bubbles and defects induced by helium ion
   implantation. The laser damage morphologies of samples before and after
   ion implantation are also presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{SmxSr1-xMnO3 with x = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8, denoted as SSM37, SSM55 and

   for cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells. Their activities in the oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) have been evaluated in comparison with the
   state-of-the-art cathode material La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM82) by
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) and thermogravimetry (TG). Among all the prepared
   cathodes, the SSM55 exhibits the lowest values, while the LSM82 exhibits
   the highest polarization resistance, at open circuit voltage (OCV) and
   temperatures from 650 to 800 degrees C. This result indicates that the
   prepared SmxSr1-xMnO3 is a promising replacement for LSM82 as cathode
   material for SOFCs, and the SSM55 represents the optimal concentration
   in SmxSr1-xMnO3 series. The remarkably high ORR activity of the SSM55 is
   ascribed to its high surface Mn4+/Mn3+ and O-ad/O-lattice ratios and
   fast surface oxygen exchange kinetics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The deposition of manganese ions dissolved from the cathode onto the
   interface between the solid electrolyte interphase (SE!) and graphite
   causes severe capacity fading in manganese oxide-based cells. The
   evolution of the SEI layer containing these Mn compounds and the
   corresponding instability of the layer are thoroughly investigated by
   artificially introducing soluble Mn ions into a 1 mol L-1 LiPF6
   electrolyte solution. Deposition of dissolved Mn ions induces an
   oxygen-rich SEI layer that results from increased electrolyte
   decomposition, accelerating SE! growth. The spatial distribution of Mn
   shows that dissolved Mn ions diffuse through the porous layer and are
   deposited mostly at the inorganic layer/graphite interface. The Mn
   compound deposited on the anode, identified as MnF2, originates from a
   metathesis reaction between LiF and dissolved Mn ion. It is confirmed
   that ion-exchange reaction occurs in the inorganic layer, converting SEI
   species to Mn compounds. Some of the Mn is observed inside the graphite;
   this may cause surface structural disordering in the graphite, limiting
   lithium-ion intercalation. The continuous reaction that occurs at the
   inorganic layer/graphite interfacial regions and the modification of the
   original SEI layer in the presence of Mn ions are critically related to
   capacity fade and impedance rise currently plaguing Li-ion cells. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of finding a stationary point of a
   nonlinear dynamical system whose state variables are under inequality
   constraints. Systems of this type often arise from the discretization of
   PDEs that model physical phenomena (e.g., fluid dynamics) in which the
   state variables are under realizability constraints (e.g., positive
   pressure and density). We start from the popular pseudo-transient
   continuation method and augment it with nonlinear inequality
   constraints. The constraint handling technique does not help in
   situations where no steady-state solution exists, for example, because
   of an under-resolved discretization of PDEs. However, an often
   overlooked situation is one in which the steady-state solution exists
   but cannot be reached by the solver, which typically fails because of
   the violation of constraints, that is, a non-physical state error during
   state iterations. This is the shortcoming that we address by
   incorporating physical realizability constraints into the solution path
   from the initial condition to steady state. Although we focus on the DG
   method applied to fluid dynamics, our technique relies only on implicit
   time marching and hence can be extended to other spatial discretizations
   and other physics problems. We analyze the sensitivity of the method to
   a range of input parameters and present results for compressible
   turbulent flows that show that the constrained method is significantly
   more robust than a standard unconstrained method while on par in terms
   of cost. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We present a set of high explosive driven Rayleigh-Taylor strength
   experiments for beryllium to produce data to distinguish predictions by

   model parameterizations from Steinberg-Lund and Preston-Tonks-Wallace
   (PTW) suggested an optimal design that would delineate between not just
   different strength models, but different parameters sets of the PTW
   model. Application of the models to the post-shot results, however,
   suggests growth consistent with little material strength. We focus
   mostly on efforts to simulate the data using published strength models
   as well as the more recent RING relaxation model developed at VNIIEF.
   The results of the strength experiments indicate weak influence of
   strength in mitigating the growth with the RING model coming closest to
   predicting the material behavior. Finally, we present shock and

Title = {{Surveying the interest of individuals with upper limb loss in novel
   prosthetic control techniques}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Novel techniques for the control of upper limb prostheses
   may allow users to operate more complex prostheses than those that are
   currently available. Because many of these techniques are surgically
   invasive, it is important to understand whether individuals with upper
   limb loss would accept the associated risks in order to use a
   prosthesis.
   Methods: An online survey of individuals with upper limb loss was
   conducted. Participants read descriptions of four prosthetic control
   techniques. One technique was noninvasive (myoelectric) and three were
   invasive (targeted muscle reinnervation, peripheral nerve interfaces,
   cortical interfaces). Participants rated how likely they were to try
   each technique if it offered each of six different functional features.
   They also rated their general interest in each of the six features. A
   two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Greenhouse-Geisser
   corrections was used to examine the effect of the technique type and
   feature on participants' interest in each technique.
   Results: Responses from 104 individuals were analyzed. Many participants
   were interested in trying the techniques 83 \% responded positively
   toward myoelectric control, 63 \% toward targeted muscle reinnervation,
   68 \% toward peripheral nerve interfaces, and 39 \% toward cortical
   interfaces. Common concerns about myoelectric control were weight, cost,
   durability, and difficulty of use, while the most common concern about
   the invasive techniques was surgical risk. Participants expressed
   greatest interest in basic prosthesis features (e.g., opening and
   closing the hand slowly), as opposed to advanced features like fine
   motor control and touch sensation.
   Conclusions: The results of these investigations may be used to inform
   the development of future prosthetic technologies that are appealing to
   individuals with upper limb loss.}},

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory based molecular dynamics with the
   tight-binding approximation and experimental characterization, the H2O
   vapor adsorption/desorption processes in Zn-MOF-74 and the corresponding
   influence on the lattice dynamics were investigated. It was found that
   the Zn sites are preferred for H2O adsorption, and they even allow for
   the adsorption of multiple H2O molecules on the same site, making it
   possible to form stable H2O cluster at low temperatures. The adsorption
   heats of different adsorption processes were predicted, and the
   possibility of H2O cluster formation under vapor exposure at low and
   room temperatures was explored. The first adsorbed H2O can only be
   dissociated at elevated temperatures, therefore reducing the cyclic
   uptake near the room temperature. The vibrational spectra of the lattice
   and adsorbed H2O were also calculated using molecular dynamics
   simulation to illuminate the variation of lattice dynamics during the
   adsorption. The framework was found to be stable after water vapor
   exposure near room temperature but may start to collapse at around 570
   K. X-ray diffraction and H2O adsorption isotherm measurements have been
   conducted to verify the theoretical predictions, and good agreements are
   found.}},

Abstract = {{A hollow microneedle (HM) was prepared to deliver a phenylephrine (PE)
   solution into the anal sphincter muscle as a method for treating fecal
   incontinence. The goal of this study was the local targeted delivery of
   PE into the sphincter muscle through the perianal skin with minimal pain
   using hollow microneedles, resulting in the increase of resting anal
   sphincter pressure. PE was administered on the left and the right sides
   of the anus of a rat through the perianal skin using 1.5 mm long HM. An
   in vivo imaging system study was conducted after injection of Rhodamine
   B, and a histological study was performed after injection of gentian
   violet. The resting anal sphincter pressure in response to various drug
   doses was measured by using an air-charged catheter. Anal pressure
   change produced by HM administration was compared with change produced
   by intravenous injection (IV), subcutaneous (SC) injection and
   intramuscular (IM) injection. The change in mean blood pressure produced
   by HM administration as a function of PE dose was compared with change
   produced by PBS injection. A pharmacokinetic study of the new HM
   administration method was performed. A model drug solution was localized
   in the muscle layer under the perianal skin at the injection site and
   then diffused out over time. HM administration of PE induced significant
   contraction of internal anal sphincter pressure over 12 h after
   injection, and the maximum anal pressure was obtained between 5 and 6 h.
   Compared to IV, SC and IM treatments, HM treatment produced greater anal
   pressure. There was no increase in blood pressure after HM
   administration of PE within the range of predetermined concentration.
   Administration of 800 mu g/kg of PE using HM produced 0.81 +/- 0.38 h of
   t(max). Our study suggests that HM administration enables local delivery
   of a therapeutic dose of PE to the anal sphincter muscle layer with less
   pain. This new treatment has great potential as a clinical application
   because of the ease of the procedure, minimal pain, and dose-dependent
   response. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Intrinsic Conductivity in Sodium-Air Battery Discharge Phases: Sodium
   Superoxide vs Sodium Peroxide}},

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3852-3860}},

Abstract = {{The primary discharge product in sodium air batteries has been reported
   in some experiments to be sodium peroxide, Na2O2, while in others sodium
   superoxide, NaO2, is observed. Importantly, cells that discharge to NaO2
   exhibit low charging overpotentials, while those that discharge to Na2O2
   do not. These differences could arise from a higher conductivity within
   the superoxide; however, this explanation remains speculative given that
   charge transport in superoxides is relatively unexplored. Here, density
   functional and quasi-particle GW methods are used to comparatively
   assess the conductivities of Na-O-2 discharge phases by calculating the
   concentrations and mobilities of intrinsic charge carriers in Na2O2 and
   NaO2. Both compounds are predicted to be electrical insulators, with
   bandgaps in excess of 5 eV. In the case of sodium peroxide, the
   transport properties are similar to those reported previously for
   lithium peroxide, suggesting low bulk conductivity. Transport in the
   superoxide has some features in common with the peroxide but also
   differs in important ways. Similar to Na2O2, NaO2 is predicted to be a
   poor electrical conductor, wherein transport is limited by sluggish
   charge hopping between O-2 dimers. Different from Na2O2, in NaO2 this
   transport is mediated by a combination of electron and hole polarons, An
   additional distinguishing feature of the Superoxide is its ionic
   conductivity, which is 10 orders of magnitude larger than the electronic
   component. The ionic component is comprised primarily of p-type
   contributions from (surprisingly mobile) oxygen dimer vacancies, and
   from n-type contributions from negative sodium vacancies. In the context
   of sodium air batteries, the low electronic conductivity afforded by
   NaO2 suggests that enhanced bulk transport within this phase is unlikely
   to account for the low overpotentials associated with its decomposition.
   Rather, the enhanced efficiency of NaO2-based cells should be attributed
   to other factors, such as a reduced tendency for electrolyte
   decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-immobilized enzymes are important for a wide range of
   technological applications, including industrial catalysis, drug
   delivery, medical diagnosis, and biosensors; however, our understanding
   of how enzymes and proteins interact with abiological surfaces on the
   molecular level remains extremely limited. We have compared the
   structure, activity, and thermal stability of two variants of a
   beta-galactosidase attached to a chemically well-defined
   maleimide-terminated self-assembled monolayer surface through a unique
   cysteinyl residue. In one case the enzyme is attached through an alpha
   helix and in the other case through an adjacent loop. Both enzymes
   exhibit similar specific activities and adopt similar orientations with
   respect to the surface normal, as determined by sum-frequency generation
   and attenuated total reflectance FT-IR spectroscopies. Surprisingly,
   however, the loop-tethered enzyme exhibits a thermal stability 10
   degrees C lower than the helix-tethered enzyme and 13 degrees C lower
   than the enzyme in free solution. Using coarse-grain models, molecular
   dynamics simulations of the thermal unfolding of the surface-tethered
   enzymes were able to reproduce these differences in stability. Thus,
   revealing that tethering through the more flexible loop position
   provides more opportunity for surface residues on the protein to
   interact with the surface and undergo surface-induced unfolding. These
   observations point to the importance of the location of the attachment
   point in determining the performance of surface-supported biocatalysts
   and suggest strategies for optimizing their activity and thermal
   stability through molecular simulations.}},

Abstract = {{One of the greatest obstacles for the realization of the nonaqueous
   Li-O-2 battery is finding a solvent that is chemically and
   electro-chemically stable : under cell operating conditions. Dimethyl
   sulfoxide (DMSO) is an attractive candidate for rechargeable Li-O-2
   battery studies; however, there is still significant controversy
   regarding its stability on the Li-O-2 cathode surface. We performed
   multiple experiments (in situ XPS, FTIR, Raman, and XRD) which assess
   the stability of the DMSO-Li-2-O-2 interface and report perspectives on
   previously published studies. Our electro-chemical experiments show
   long-term stable cycling of a DMSO-based operating Li-O-2 cell with a
   platinum@carbon nanotube core-shell cathode fabricated via atomic layer
   deposition, specifically with >45 cycles of 40 h of discharge per cycle.
   This work is complemented by density functional theory calculations of
   DMSO degradation pathways on Li2O2. Both experimental and theoretical
   evidence strongly suggests that DMSO it chemically and electrochemically
   stable On the surface of Li-2-O-2 under the reported operating

   Garnet-Based Ionic Conductors for Advanced Li Batteries}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{Solid electrolytes based on the garnet crystal structure have recently
   been identified as a promising material to enable advance Li battery
   cell chemistries because of the unprecedented combination of high ionic
   conductivity and electrochemical stability against metallic Li. To
   better understand the mechanisms that give rise to high conductivity,
   the goal of this work is to correlate Li site occupancy with Li-ion
   transport. Toward this goal, the Li site occupancy is studied in cubic
   garnet as a function of Li concentration over the compositions range:
   Li7-xLa3Zr2-xTaxO12 (x = 0.5, 0.75, and 1.5). The distribution of Li
   between the two interstitial sites (24d and 96h) is determined using
   neutron and synchrotron diffraction. The bulk conductivity is measured
   on >97\% relative density polycrystalline specimens to correlate Li-ion
   transport as a function of Li site occupancy. It is determined that the
   conductivity changes nonlinearly with the occupancy of the octahedral
   (96h) Li site. It is shown that the effective carrier concentration is
   dependent on the Li site occupancy and suggests that this is a
   consequence of significant carrier-carrier coulombic interactions.
   Furthermore, the observation of maximum conductivity near Li = 6.5 mol
   is explained.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic hazards pose a significant concern for older steel bridges in
   the Central and Eastern USA. The majority of these bridges still use
   steel bearings that are not designed to sustain earthquake loads. To
   assess older bridge vulnerability, an understanding of the cyclic
   behaviour of their components, such as steel bolster and rocker
   bearings, is needed. A theoretical analysis is conducted to understand
   steel bearing behaviour and their potential limit states, which also
   serves to validate bearing finite element models. The high fidelity
   models are used to evaluate the hysteretic behaviour of the bearings.
   The influence of gravity load on the response is evaluated to consider
   different bridge configurations, while varying the friction coefficient
   between steel surfaces allows for consideration of effects from ageing
   and corrosion. These parameters are shown to influence the response
   suggesting the need to consider ageing effects in assessing the
   vulnerability of in situ bridges.}},

Abstract = {{An open-source implementation of chemistry modeling for the direct
   simulation Monte Carlo method is presented. Following the recent work of
   Bird (Bird, G. A., `` The Q-K Model for Gas Phase Chemical Reaction
   Rates,{''} Physics of Fluids, Vol. 23, No. 10, 2011, Paper 106101), an
   approach known as the quantum-kinetic method has been adopted to
   describe chemical reactions in a five-species air model using direct
   simulation Monte Carlo procedures based on microscopic gas information.
   The quantum-kinetic technique has been implemented within the framework
   of the dsmcFoam code, a derivative of the open-source
   computational-fluid-dynamics code OpenFOAM. Results for vibrational
   relaxation, dissociation, and exchange reaction rates for an adiabatic
   bath demonstrate the success of the quantum-kinetic model implementation
   in dsmcFoam when compared with analytical solutions for both inert and
   reacting conditions. A comparison is also made between the
   quantum-kinetic and total collision energy chemistry approaches for a
   hypersonic flow benchmark case.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of the contractile properties of chemically skinned, or
   permeabilized, skeletal muscle fibers offers a powerful means by which
   to assess muscle function at the level of the single muscle cell. Single
   muscle fiber studies are useful in both basic science and clinical
   studies. For basic studies, single muscle fiber contractility
   measurements allow investigation of fundamental mechanisms of force
   production, and analysis of muscle function in the context of genetic
   manipulations. Clinically, single muscle fiber studies provide useful
   insight into the impact of injury and disease on muscle function, and
   may be used to guide the understanding of muscular pathologies. In this
   video article we outline the steps required to prepare and isolate an
   individual skeletal muscle fiber segment, attach it to force-measuring
   apparatus, activate it to produce maximum isometric force, and estimate
   its cross-sectional area for the purpose of normalizing the force

Abstract = {{Neurosurgeries to remove pituitary tumors using the endonasal,
   transsphenoidal approach often incur the risk of patient death caused by
   injury to the carotid arteries hidden by surrounding sphenoid bone. To
   avoid this risk, we propose intraoperative photoacoustic vessel
   visualization with an optical fiber attached to the surgical tool and an
   external ultrasound transducer placed on the temple. Vessel detection
   accuracy is limited by acoustic propagation properties, which were
   investigated with k-Wave simulations. In a two-layer model of temporal
   bone (3200 m/s sound speed, 1-4 mm thickness) and surrounding tissues,
   the localization error was <= 2 mm in the tranducer's axial dimension,
   while temporal bone curvature further degraded target localization.
   Phantom experiments revealed that multiple image targets (e.g. sphenoid
   bone and vessels) can be visualized, particularly with coherence-based
   beamforming, to determine tool-to-vessel proximity despite expected
   localization errors. In addition, the potential flexibility of the fiber
   position relative to the transducer and vessel was elucidated. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A framework of multi-objective topology optimization for vehicle

   Incorporating into the simplified isotropic material with penalization

   multi-objective and multi-stiffness topology optimization under static
   loading conditions, whereas mean eigenvalue formulation is proposed to
   analyze vibration optimization. To yield well-behaved optimal
   topologies, minimum member size and draw constraint are settled for
   meeting manufacturing feasibility requirements. The ultimate mounting
   bracket is reconstructed based on the optimum results. Numerical
   analyses of the bracket are performed, followed by physical tests. It is
   proven that topology optimization methodology is promising and effective

Abstract = {{The recent progress of advanced vehicle control systems presents a great
   opportunity for the application of model predictive control (MPC) in the
   automotive industry. However, high computational complexity inherently
   associated with the receding horizon optimization must be addressed to
   achieve real-time implementation. This paper presents a generic scale
   reduction framework to reduce the online computational burden of MPC
   controllers. A lower dimensional MPC algorithm is formulated by
   combining an existing ``move blocking ``strategy with a ``constraint-set
   compression{''} strategy, which is proposed to further reduce the
   problem scale by partially relaxing inequality constraints in the
   prediction horizon. The closed-loop stability is guaranteed by adding
   terminal zero-state constraint. The trade-off between control optimality
   and computational intensity is achieved by proper design of the blocking
   and compression matrices. The fast algorithm has been applied on
   intelligent vehicular longitudinal automation, implemented as a fuel
   economy-oriented adaptive cruise controller and experimentally evaluated
   by a series of real-time simulations and field tests. These results
   indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the
   computational speed while maintaining satisfactory control optimality
   without sacrificing the desired performance.}},

Abstract = {{As the complexity of the systems aboard the new classes of ships being
   commissioned by the United States Navy has increased, the capability of
   the Navy's system analysis tools to analyze these systems has struggled
   to keep up. This has driven an increase in cost, technical risk, and
   longer schedules on these new acquisition programs. In order to
   ameliorate this situation, the authors of this paper suggest unifying
   the Navy's system analysis capability around the Leading Edge
   Architecture for Prototyping Systems (LEAPS), a data format mandated by
   the Naval Sea Systems Command. In this paper, the authors describe a
   network-based systems model for ship systems and demonstrate how a
   system modeled in this way can be expressed to load-flow analysis
   software, a time-domain electrical analysis code, a ship synthesis tool,
   and a deactivation-diagram-based systems vulnerability code.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a framework for indexing of grain and subgrain structures in
   electron backscatter diffraction patterns of polycrystalline materials.
   We discretize the domain of a dynamical forward model onto a dense grid
   of orientations, producing a dictionary of patterns. For each measured
   pattern, we identify the most similar patterns in the dictionary, and
   identify boundaries, detect anomalies, and index crystal orientations.
   The statistical distribution of these closest matches is used in an
   unsupervised binary decision tree (DT) classifier to identify grain
   boundaries and anomalous regions. The DT classifies a pattern as an
   anomaly if it has an abnormally low similarity to any pattern in the
   dictionary. It classifies a pixel as being near a grain boundary if the
   highly ranked patterns in the dictionary differ significantly over the
   pixel's neighborhood. Indexing is accomplished by computing the mean
   orientation of the closest matches to each pattern. The mean orientation
   is estimated using a maximum likelihood approach that models the
   orientation distribution as a mixture of Von Mises-Fisher distributions
   over the quaternionic three sphere. The proposed dictionary matching
   approach permits segmentation, anomaly detection, and indexing to be
   performed in a unified manner with the additional benefit of uncertainty
   quantification.}},

Abstract = {{Conjugated polymers (CPs) are widely investigated because of their
   intriguing optical and semiconducting properties in various
   optoelectronic device applications. Because of the one-dimensional
   p-orbital overlap along the main chain, CPs exhibit strong anisotropy in
   optoelectronic characteristics. Therefore, macroscopic assembly and
   alignment of CPs are essential to fully utilize their potential
   properties in real device applications. Here we review various
   processing strategies and material design principles for efficient CP
   alignment that result in highly anisotropic optical and electronic
   characteristics. Furthermore, we thoroughly review the incorporation of
   aligned CPs layers in organic light-emitting diodes, organic thin film
   transistors, and organic photovoltaic devices. The achieved macroscopic
   CP alignment has increased the optoelectronic properties and greatly
   improved device performance.}},

Title = {{Testing of a spreading mechanism to promote diversity in multi-objective

Journal = {{OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{279-302}},

Abstract = {{The design of many real-life engineering systems involves optimization
   according to multiple, often conflicting, objectives. In this paper, an
   algorithm called spreading multi-objective particle swarm optimizer
   (SMOPSO) is developed and tested for optimization problems with two
   objectives. The motivation for SMOPSO is to promote a high diversity of
   solutions found in two-objective particle swarm optimization. This is
   attempted through the use of a spreading function based on neighboring
   particle positions and an archive controller which discriminates based
   on particle spacing. The spreading function directs non-dominated
   particles away from their nearest neighbor, aiming for evenly-spaced
   solutions as particles ``spread out{''}. To test if such an approach can
   indeed improve Pareto front diversity, a performance comparison of
   SMOPSO is made to two benchmark algorithms. Preliminary results suggest
   the proposed algorithm may improve the diversity of solutions for a
   limited selection of optimization problems, but at the expense of other
   important measures of performance which is discussed in this paper.
   SMOPSO's performance degrades for more difficult optimization problems,
   such those with multiple fronts and narrow global minima. An example
   application of SMOPSO to a theoretical, two-objective high-speed planing
   craft design problem is also given.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common multifocal inflammatory
   demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Due to the
   progressive neurodegenerative nature of MS, developing treatments that
   exhibit direct neuroprotective effects are needed. Tecfidera (TM)
   (BG-12) is an oral formulation of the fumaric acid esters (FAE),
   containing the active metabolite dimethyl fumarate (DMF). Although BG-12
   showed remarkable efficacy in lowering relapse rates in clinical trials,
   its mechanism of action in MS is not yet well understood. In this study,
   we reported the potential neuroprotective effects of dimethyl fumarate
   (DMF) on mouse and rat neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons.
   We found that DMF increased the frequency of the multipotent
   neurospheres and the survival of NPCs following oxidative stress with
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment. In addition, utilizing the reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) assay, we showed that DMF reduced ROS production
   induced by H2O2. DMF also decreased oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.
   Using motor neuron survival assay, DMF significantly promoted survival
   of motor neurons under oxidative stress. We further analyzed the
   expression of oxidative stress-induced genes in the NPC cultures and
   showed that DMF increased the expression of transcription factor nuclear
   factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) at both levels of RNA and
   protein. Furthermore, we demonstrated the involvement of Nrf2-ERK1/2
   MAPK pathway in DMF-mediated neuroprotection. Finally, we utilized
   SuperArray gene screen technology to identify additional anti-oxidative
   stress genes (Gstp1, Sod2, Nqo1, Srxn1, Fth1). Our data suggests that
   analysis of anti-oxidative stress mechanisms may yield further insights
   into new targets for treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Cavitation occurs in a variety of non-Newtonian fluids and viscoelastic
   materials. The large-amplitude volumetric oscillations of cavitation
   bubbles give rise to high temperatures and pressures at collapse, as
   well as induce large and rapid deformation of the surroundings. In this
   work, we develop a comprehensive numerical framework for spherical
   bubble dynamics in isotropic media obeying a wide range of viscoelastic
   constitutive relationships. Our numerical approach solves the
   compressible Keller-Miksis equation with full thermal effects (inside
   and outside the bubble) when coupled to a highly generalized
   constitutive relationship (which allows Newtonian, Kelvin-Voigt, Zener,
   linear Maxwell, upper-convected Maxwell, Jeffreys, Oldroyd-B, Giesekus,
   and Phan-Thien-Tanner models). For the latter two models, partial
   differential equations (PDEs) must be solved in the surrounding medium;
   for the remaining models, we show that the PDEs can be reduced to
   ordinary differential equations. To solve the general constitutive PDEs,
   we present a Chebyshev spectral collocation method, which is robust even
   for violent collapse. Combining this numerical approach with theoretical
   analysis, we simulate bubble dynamics in various viscoelastic media to
   determine the impact of relaxation time, a constitutive parameter, on
   the associated physics. Relaxation time is found to increase bubble
   growth and permit rebounds driven purely by residual stresses in the
   surroundings. Different regimes of oscillations occur depending on the
   relaxation time. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Cationic gene delivery agents (vectors) are important for delivering
   nucleotides, but are also responsible for cytotoxicity. Cationic
   polymers (L-PEI, jetPEI, and G5 PAMAM) at 1 x to 100 x the
   concentrations required for translational activity (protein expression)
   induced the same increase in plasma membrane current of HEK 293A cells
   (30-50 nA) as measured by whole cell patch-clamp. This indicates
   saturation of the cell membrane by the cationic polymers. The increased
   currents induced by the polymers are not reversible for over 15 min.
   Irreversibility on this time scale is consistent with a
   polymer-supported pore or carpet model and indicates that the cell is
   unable to clear the polymer from the membrane. For polyplexes, although
   the charge concentration was the same (at N/P ratio of 10:1), G5 PAMAM
   and jetPEI polyplexes induced a much larger current increase (40- 50 nA)
   than L-PEI polyplexes (<20 nA). Both free cationic lipid and lipid
   polyplexes induced a lower increase in current than cationic polymers
   (<20 nA). To quantify the membrane bound material, partition constants
   were measured for both free vectors and polyplexes into the HEK 293A
   cell membrane using a dye influx assay. The partition constants of free
   vectors increased with charge density of the vectors. Polyplex partition
   constants did not show such a trend. The long lasting cell plasma
   permeability induced by exposure to the polymer vectors or the
   polyplexes provides a plausible mechanism for the toxicity and
   inflammatory response induced by exposure to these materials.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for generating an arbitrary, prescribed radiation pattern
   from a 1-D leaky-wave antenna is presented. The technique is applied to
   leaky-wave impedance surfaces. A homogenized model for an impedance
   surface is used so that the work is not limited to particular
   geometries. The model consists of a grounded, uniaxial dielectric
   substrate topped by a reactance sheet. To synthesize prescribed aperture
   fields, the leakage constant alpha(parallel to) and phase constant
   beta(parallel to) along the antenna are tailored. The aperture field is
   determined by adapting the Orchard-Elliott method used in array
   synthesis to continuous line sources. The aperture field is related to
   alpha(parallel to) and beta(parallel to) using a well-known approach,
   then the transverse resonance technique is employed to analytically
   relate alpha(parallel to) and beta(parallel to) to the electrical
   parameters of the impedance surface. Specifically, the extraordinary
   index and sheet reactance are used to control alpha(parallel to) and
   beta(parallel to). The designs presented demonstrate the synthesis of a
   variety of far-field patterns. Full-wave simulations show an improvement
   over previous beam synthesis techniques based on geometrical optics.
   Moreover, the numerical techniques demonstrate an efficient, gradient
   search method as an alternative to the iterative FFT methods explored
   previously, which have not generated radiation patterns with such high
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The lower VHF band has potential for low-power, short-range
   communications, as well as for geolocation applications, in both indoor
   and urban environments. Most prior work at low VHF focuses on longer
   range path loss modeling, often with one node elevated. In this paper,
   we study indoor/outdoor near-ground scenarios through experiments and
   electromagnetic wave propagation simulations. These include the effects
   of indoor penetration through walls and obstacles, as well as
   indoor/outdoor cases, for both line of sight (LoS) and nonLoS (NLoS), at
   ranges up to 200 m. Mounting our receiver (Rx) on a robotic platform
   enabled the collection of thousands of measurements over an extended
   indoor/outdoor test area. We measure the channel transfer function,
   employing bandpass waveform sampling, with pulse and tone probe signals.
   Based on statistical tests, we show that the measured channels have a
   nearly ideal scalar attenuation and delay transfer function, with
   minimal phase distortion, and little to no evidence of multipath
   propagation. Compared with higher VHF and above, the measured
   short-range VHF channels do not exhibit small-scale fading, which
   simplifies communications Rx signal processing, and enables phase-based
   geolocation techniques.}},

Title = {{The mixing region in freely decaying variable-density turbulence}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{772}},
Pages = {{386-426}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A novel set-up is proposed to numerically study turbulent multimaterial
   mixing, starting from an unperturbed material interface between a light
   and a heavy fluid. We conduct direct numerical simulation (DNS) to
   better understand the role of density gradient alone on the turbulence,
   specifically with regard to the mixing region dynamics and anisotropy
   across scales. Freely decaying isotropic turbulent fields of different
   densities but identical kinematic viscosities are juxtaposed. The
   rationale for this strategy is that conventional turbulence scalings are
   based on kinetic energy per unit mass and kinematic viscosity. Thus, by
   matching the initial kinematics (root-mean-square velocity) and the
   dissipation (kinematic viscosity), the turbulence (kinetic energy per
   unit mass) decays at the same rate in both fluids. With this set-up, the
   effect of the density gradient alone on the turbulence can be
   considered, independently from other contributions (e.g. mismatch in
   kinetic energy per unit mass, acceleration field, etc.). We examine the
   mixing region dynamics at large and small scales for different density
   ratios and Reynolds numbers. After an initial transient, we observe a
   self-similar growth of the mixing region, which we explain via
   theoretical arguments verified by the DNS results. Inside the mixing
   region, the momentum of the heavier eddies causes the mean interface
   location to shift toward the light fluid. A higher density ratio leads
   to a wider, less molecularly mixed mixing region. Although anisotropy is
   evident at the large scales, the dissipation scales remain essentially
   isotropic, even at the highest density ratio under consideration (12:
   1). The intermittency of the velocity field exhibits isotropy, while the
   mass fraction field is more intermittent in the direction of the density
   gradient.}},

   design of experiments (DOE), approximation techniques, and a design
   optimization algorithm. 35 sampling points of computational experiments
   are performed to find the optimum values of the design variables. In all
   cases, ANSYS Maxwell electromagnetic analysis software was used to model
   the electromagnetic dynamics. An approximate model generated from the
   electromagnetic analysis was estimated and used for the optimization.
   The best optimization model was selected using the verified

Abstract = {{Platelets have been long postulated to play a critical role in the
   pathogenesis of prostate cancer, although relatively little is known
   regarding the precise mechanisms involved. Androgen deprivation therapy
   (ADT) for prostate cancer eventually fails with relapse occurring in the
   form of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC tumors
   typically overexpress androgen receptor (AR), demonstrating continued
   dependence upon AR signaling. Platelets have been previously
   demonstrated to contain androgens, and we sought to explore the
   contribution of platelet-derived androgens in CRPC. In this study, we
   examined the role of platelet-derived androgens in vitro using platelets
   from men with CRPC, men with high-risk prostate cancer, and healthy male
   donors. A series of in vitro assays was performed to elucidate the
   impact of platelet-derived androgens on androgen-sensitive prostate
   tumor cells. By examining platelet-derived androgen effects on AR
   signaling in prostate tumor cells, we found that platelets, from men
   with CRPC and on ADT, strongly induce AR target genes and tumor cell
   proliferation. Moreover, we show a fully intact testosterone (T)
   biosynthetic pathway within platelets from its precursor cholesterol and
   demonstrate that platelets of CRPC patients with ADT resistance are able
   to generate T. Overall, our findings reveal an unknown capacity of
   platelets to synthesize T at functionally relevant levels in patients
   with lethal prostate cancer. Importantly, it suggests a novel paracrine
   mechanism of T production that may act to sustain CRPC state and
   potentiate therapeutic resistance.}},

Abstract = {{We achieved two types of laser emissions from aqueous quantum dots (Qps)
   using the same high-Q:factor optofluidic ring resonator (OFRR) platform.
   In the first type, 2 mu M QDs were in bulk buffer solution that filled
   the entire OFRR cavity volume. The lasing threshold was 0.1 mu J/mm(2),
   over 3 orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art. In the
   second type of laser, the QDs were immobilized as a single layer on the
   interface between the OFRR inner wall and buffer solution with a surface
   density as low as 3 X 10(9)-10(10) cm(-2). The lasing threshold of 60 mu
   J/mm(2) was achieved. In both bulk solution and single-layer lasing
   cases, the laser emission persisted even under 5-10 min of uninterrupted
   pulsed optical excitation that was well above the corresponding lasing
   threshold, indicative of high photostability of the QD laser. This was
   in sharp contrast to organic-dye-based lasers, which underwent quick
   photobleaching during the laser operation under similar pumping
   conditions. Theoretical analysis is also carried out to elucidate the
   advantages of QD-based optofluidic lasers over those based on dyes. Our
   work opens the door to a plethora of applications where optofluidic QD
   lasers can replace dye-based optofluidic lasers in biosensing and
   on-chip miniaturized laser development.}},

   prediction for aircraft mission analysis}},
Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{126-151}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The accurate evaluation of aircraft fuel burn over a complete mission is
   computationally expensive and may require millions of aerodynamic
   performance evaluations. Thus, it is advantageous to use surrogate
   models as approximations of high-fidelity aerodynamic or aerostructural
   models. Conventional surrogate models, such as the radial basis function
   and kriging, cannot model these functions accurately, especially in the
   transonic regime. To address this issue, we explore several ways to
   improve the accuracy of surrogate models. First, we employ an adaptive
   sampling algorithm to complement a traditional space-filling algorithm.
   Second, we improve the kriging surrogate performance by including
   gradient information in the interpolation (a form of gradient-enhanced
   kriging-GEK) and by introducing a known trend in the global model
   component (kriging with a trend). Lastly, we propose a mixture of
   experts (ME) approach, which is based on the divide-and-conquer
   principle. We validate our surrogate models using aerodynamic data for
   conventional and unconventional aircraft configurations, and we assess
   their performance in predicting the mission ranges by analyzing ten
   mission profiles. Our results show that the proposed ME approach is
   superior to the traditional models. Using a mixture of GEK models to
   approximate the drag coefficients gives approximation errors of less
   than 5\% with fewer than 150 samples, whereas the adaptive sampling
   fails to converge when training a global model. However, when we have a
   simple function profile, such as the lift and moment coefficients, using
   a conventional surrogate model is more efficient than an ME model,
   because of the added computational complexity in the latter. The range
   estimation errors associated with the ME models are less than 2\% for
   all the benchmark mission profiles considered, whereas some traditional
   models yield errors as high as 20-80\%. We thus conclude that the ME
   technique is both necessary and sufficient for modeling the aerodynamic
   coefficients for surrogate-based mission analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Supporting information retrieval from electronic health records: A
   report of University of Michigan's nine-year experience in developing
   and using the Electronic Medical Record Search Engine (EMERSE)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{290-300}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: This paper describes the University of Michigan's nine-year
   experience in developing and using a full-text search engine designed to
   facilitate information retrieval (IR) from narrative documents stored in
   electronic health records (EHRs). The system, called the Electronic
   Medical Record Search Engine (EMERSE), functions similar to Google but
   is equipped with special functionalities for handling challenges unique
   to retrieving information from medical text.
   Materials and methods: Key features that distinguish EMERSE from
   general-purpose search engines are discussed, with an emphasis on
   functions crucial to (1) improving medical IR performance and (2)
   assuring search quality and results consistency regardless of users'
   medical background, stage of training, or level of technical expertise.
   Results: Since its initial deployment, EMERSE has been enthusiastically
   embraced by clinicians, administrators, and clinical and translational
   researchers. To date, the system has been used in supporting more than
   750 research projects yielding 80 peer-reviewed publications. In several
   evaluation studies, EMERSE demonstrated very high levels of sensitivity
   and specificity in addition to greatly improved chart review efficiency.
   Discussion: Increased availability of electronic data in healthcare does
   not automatically warrant increased availability of information. The
   success of EMERSE at our institution illustrates that free-text EHR
   search engines can be a valuable tool to help practitioners and
   researchers retrieve information from EHRs more effectively and
   efficiently, enabling critical tasks such as patient case synthesis and
   research data abstraction. Conclusion: EMERSE, available free of charge
   for academic use, represents a state-of-the-art medical IR tool with
   proven effectiveness and user acceptance. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Title = {{On the mechanism of turbulent drag reduction with super-hydrophobic
   surfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{773}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The mechanism of turbulent drag reduction (DR) with super-hydrophobic
   (SH) surfaces is investigated by direct numerical simulation (DNS) and
   analysis of the governing equations in channel flow. The DNS studies
   were performed using lattice Boltzmann methods in Channels with
   `idealized' SH surfaces on both walls, comprised of longitudinal
   micro-grooves (MG), transverse MG, or micro-posts. DRs of 5 \% to 83 \%,
   -4\% to 20\%, and 14\% to 81\% were realized in DNS with longitudinal
   MG, transverse MG, and micro-posts, respectively. By mathematical.
   analysis of the governing equations, it is shown that, in SH channel
   flows with any periodic SH micro pattern on the walls, the magnitude of
   DR can be expressed as DR = U-slip/U-bulk + O(epsilon), where the first
   term represents the DR resulting from the effective slip on the walls,
   and the second term represents the DR or drag increase (DI) resulting
   from modifications to the turbulence dynamics and any secondary mean
   flows established in the SH channel compared to a channel flow with
   no-slip walls at the same bulk Reynolds number as the SH channel.
   Comparison of this expression to DNS results shows that, with all SH
   surface micro-patterns studied, between 80\% and 100\% of the DR in
   turbulent flow arises from the effective slip on the walls.
   Modifications to the turbulence dynamics contribute no more than 20\% of
   the total DR with longitudinal MG or micro-posts of high shear-free
   fraction (SEE), and a DI with transverse MG or micro-posts of moderate
   SFF. The effect of the SH surface on the normalized dynamics of
   turbulence is found to be small in all cases, and confined to additional
   production of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) within a thin `surface
   layer' of thickness of the order of the width of surface
   micro-indentations. Outside of this `surface layer', the normalized
   dynamics of turbulence proceeds as in a turbulent channel flow with
   no-slip walls at the friction Reynolds number of the SH channel flow.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SHIP RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{99-112}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Roll motion control and path following are two representative marine
   control problems that have been traditionally treated separately.
   However, these two problems are closely coupled, as roll motion could
   cause negative effects on marine surface vessels during path following
   in seaways and path following actions could cause undesirable roll
   motion. In this article, an optimal controller is proposed for the
   integrated path following and roll motion control problem. The rudder,
   whose actuation amplitude and rate are both limited, is the only control
   input, while the cross-track error, heading angle, roll rate, and roll
   angle are the outputs that collectively define the performance of the
   system. This leads to a classic underactuated problem. Model predictive
   control is the natural choice for the solution, given its capability in
   dealing with constraints and multi-input multi-output system, and its
   design will be pursued in this article. Line of sight technique is used
   to extend the straight-line path following to arbitrary path following.
   A four degrees of freedom high-fidelity model is implemented as the
   simulation model, and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of
   the proposed controller. The influences of the control design parameters
   on system performance are investigated and the trade-offs between two
   key attributes, namely, the roll reduction and path following, are
   explored.}},

Title = {{A digitally generated ultrafine optical frequency comb for spectral
   measurements with 0.01-pm resolution and 0.7-mu s response time}},
Journal = {{LIGHT-SCIENCE \& APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Optical spectral measurements are crucial for optical sensors and many
   other applications, but the prevailing methods, such as optical spectrum
   analysis and tunable laser spectroscopy, often have to make compromises
   among resolution, speed, and accuracy. Optical frequency combs are
   widely used for metrology of discrete atomic and molecular spectral
   lines. However, they are usually generated by optical methods and have
   large comb spacing, which limits the resolution for direct sampling of
   continuous spectra. To overcome these problems, this paper presents an
   original method to digitally generate an ultrafine optical frequency
   comb (UFOFC) as the frequency ruler for spectral measurements. Each comb
   line provides one sampling point, and the full spectrum can be captured
   at the same time using coherent detection. For an experimental
   demonstration, we adopted the inverse fast Fourier transform to generate
   a UFOFC with a comb spacing of 1.46 MHz over a 10-GHz range and
   demonstrated its functions using a Mach-Zehnder refractive index sensor.
   The UFOFC obtains a spectral resolution of 0.01 pm and response time of
   0.7 mu s; both represent 100-fold improvements over the state of the art
   and could be further enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The UFOFC
   presented here could facilitate new label-free sensor applications that
   require both high resolution and fast speed, such as measuring binding

Abstract = {{GaN nanowires and InGaN disk heterostructures are grown on an amorphous
   SiO2 layer by a plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Structural
   studies using scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy reveal that the nanowires grow
   vertically without any extended defect similarly to nanowires grown on
   Si. The as-grown nanowires have an intermediate region consisting of Ga,
   O, and Si rather than SiNx at the interface between the nanowires and
   SiO2. The measured photoluminescence shows a variation of peak
   wavelengths ranging from 580 nm to 635 nm because of non-uniform indium
   incorporation. The nanowires grown on SiO2 are successfully transferred
   to a flexible polyimide sheet by Au-welding and epitaxial lift-off
   processes. The light-emitting diodes fabricated with the transferred
   nanowires are characterized by a turn-on voltage of approximately 4 V.
   The smaller turn-on voltage in contrast to those of conventional
   nanowire light-emitting diodes is due to the absence of an intermediate
   layer, which is removed during an epitaxial lift-off process. The
   measured electroluminescence shows peak wavelengths of 610-616 nm with
   linewidths of 116-123 nm. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Slowed reaction time (RT) represents both a risk factor for and a
   consequence of sport concussion. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the reliability and criterion validity of a novel clinical
   test of simple and complex RT, called RTdin, in contact sport athletes.
   Both tasks were adapted from the well-known ruler drop test of RT and
   involve manually grasping a falling vertical shaft upon its release,
   with the complex task employing a go/no-go paradigm based on a light
   cue. In 46 healthy contact sport athletes (24 men; M = 16.3 yr., SD =
   5.0; 22 women: M age = 15.0 yr., SD = 4.0) whose sports included soccer,
   ice hockey, American football, martial arts, wrestling, and lacrosse,
   the latency and accuracy of simple and complex RTdin had acceptable
   test-retest and inter-rater reliabilities and correlated with a
   computerized criterion standard, the Axon Computerized Cognitive
   Assessment Tool. Medium to large effect sizes were found. The novel
   RTdin tests have acceptable reliability and criterion validity for
   clinical use and hold promise as concussion assessment tools.}},

Title = {{Biaxial mechanical characterization of bat wing skin}},
Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The highly flexible and stretchable wing skin of bats, together with the
   skeletal structure and musculature, enables large changes in wing shape
   during flight. Such compliance distinguishes bat wings from those of all
   other flying animals. Although several studies have investigated the
   aerodynamics and kinematics of bats, few have examined the complex
   histology and mechanical response of the wing skin. This work presents
   the first biaxial characterization of the local deformation, mechanical
   properties, and fiber kinematics of bat wing skin. Analysis of these
   data has provided insight into the relationships among the structural
   morphology, mechanical properties, and functionality of wing skin. Large
   spatial variations in tissue deformation and non-negligible fiber
   strains in the cross-fiber direction for both chordwise and spanwise
   fibers indicate fibers should be modeled as two-dimensional elements.
   The macroscopic constitutive behavior was anisotropic and nonlinear,
   with very low spanwise and chordwise stiffness (hundreds of kilopascals)
   in the toe region of the stress-strain curve. The structural arrangement
   of the fibers and matrix facilitates a low energy mechanism for wing
   deployment and extension, and we fabricate examples of skins capturing
   this mechanism. Wepropose a comprehensive deformation map for the entire
   loading regime. The results of this work underscore the importance of
   biaxial field approaches for soft heterogeneous tissue, and provide a
   foundation for development of bio-inspired skins to probe the effects of
   the wing skin properties on aerodynamic performance.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Soft actuators comprised of fluidic structures with fiber-reinforced
   elastomeric enclosures are seen throughout nature, exhibiting strength,
   power density, resilience, and diverse motions and forces. However,
   these structures are rarely used by engineers, in part due to the
   absence of a generalized understanding of their kinematics and forces. A
   small subset of soft actuators generating only extension or compression,
   popularly known as McKibben actuators, has been thoroughly investigated.
   This paper introduces the entire design space of actuators built with
   two families of fibers, of which McKibben actuators occupy a subset. The
   helix angle of the actuator's translation and rotation deformation is
   determined from the kinematics of the fiber deformation for all fiber
   angles as the actuator is pressurized. The volumetric transduction of
   the actuators, relating the output motion to change in contained volume,
   is analytically determined. The results are discretized to provide a
   designer with an easy to use design selection chart. The kinematics,
   force, and moment of the actuators are experimentally validated for all
   fiber angles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a double-sided LCC compensation network and its

   topology and its tuning method, the resonant frequency is irrelevant

   independent of the load condition, which means that the system can work
   at a constant switching frequency. Analysis in frequency domain is given
   to show the characteristics of the proposed method. We also propose a
   method to tune the network to realize zero voltage switching (ZVS) for
   the Primary-side switches. Simulation and experimental results verified
   analysis and validity of the proposed compensation network and the
   tuning method. A wireless charging system with output power of up to 7.7
   kW for electric vehicles was built, and 96\% efficiency from dc power
   source to battery load is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary behavioral choices have a strong effect on the environmental
   impact associated with the food system. Here, we consider the greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions associated with production of food that is lost at
   the retail and consumer level, as well as the potential effects on GHG
   emissions of a shift to dietary recommendations. Calculations are based
   on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food availability data
   set and literature meta-analysis of emission factors for various food
   types. Food losses contribute 1.4kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide
   equivalents (CO2-eq) capita(-1)day(-1) (28\%) to the overall carbon
   footprint of the average U.S. diet; in total, this is equivalent to the
   emissions of 33million average passenger vehicles annually. Whereas beef
   accounts for only 4\% of the retail food supply by weight, it represents
   36\% of the diet-related GHG emissions. An iso-caloric shift from the
   current average U.S. diet to USDA dietary recommendations could result
   in a 12\% increase in diet-related GHG emissions, whereas a shift that
   includes a decrease in caloric intake, based on the needs of the
   population (assuming moderate activity), results in a small (1\%)
   decrease in diet-related GHG emissions. These findings emphasize the
   need to consider environmental costs of food production in formulating
   recommended food patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies measured the effects of Rn-222 on various
   thermoluminescent dosemeters (TLDs). This study quantified the effects
   of Rn-222 on LiF :Ti, Mg chips encapsulated in plastic extremity rings.
   For 28d, one batch of TLDs was left in a chamber with high radon levels,
   and another batch in a control chamber with normal background radon
   levels. A few TLDs in each batch were removed from the rings for direct
   exposure to the ambient air in each chamber. Passive continuous radon
   monitors (CRMs) recorded the Rn-222 levels. TLDs were processed using a
   third-party dosimetry company, CRM data were analysed, and the
   relationship between integrated Rn-222 concentration and TLD response
   was determined. The batch of TLDs in the experimental chamber showed a
   weak response to Rn-222 gas, which was in the order of 0.5 nSv Bq(-1)
   m(3) d(-1).}},

Abstract = {{We find that mixtures of C-60 with the wide energy gap, small molecular
   Weight semiconductor bathophenanthroline (BPhen) exhibit a combination
   of surprisingly high electron Conductivity and efficient exciton
   blocking when employed as buffer layers in Organic photovoltaic cells.
   Photoluminescence quenching measurements show that a 1:1 BPhen/C-60
   mixed layer has an exciton blocking efficiency Of 84 +/- 5\% compared to
   that of 100\% for a neat BPhen layer. This high blocking efficiency
   accompanied by a 100-fold increase in electron conductivity compared
   with neat BPhen, Transient photocurrent measurements show that charge
   transport through a Peat BPhen buffer is' dispersive, in contrast to
   nondispersive transport in the compound buffer. Interestingly, although
   the conductivity is high, there is no clearly defined
   insulating-to-conducting phase transition with increased insulating
   BPhen fraction. Thus, we infer that C-60 undergoes nanoscale (<10 nm
   domain size) phase segregation even at very high (>80\%) BPhen
   fractions,}},

Journal = {{NANO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{4234-4239}},

Abstract = {{The photo-Dember effect arises from the asymmetric diffusivity of
   photoexcited electrons and holes, which creates a transient spatial
   charge distribution and hence the buildup of a voltage. Conventionally,
   a strong photo-Dember effect is only observed in semiconductors with a
   large asymmetry between the electron and hole mobilities, such as in
   GaAs or InAs, and is considered negligible in graphene due to its
   electron hole symmetry. Here, we report the observation of a strong
   lateral photo-Dember effect induced by nonequilibrium hot carrier
   dynamics when exciting a graphene metal interface with a femtosecond
   laser. Scanning photocurrent measurement reveal the extraction of
   photoexcited hot carriers is driven by the transient photo-Dember field,
   and the polarity of the photo current is determined by the device's
   mobility asymmetry. Furthermore, ultrafast pump probe measurements
   indicate the magnitude of photocurrent is related to the hot carrier
   cooling rate. Our simulations also suggest that the lateral photo-Dember
   effect originates from graphene's 2D nature combined with its unique
   electrical and optical properties. Taken together, these results not
   only reveal a new ultrafast photocurrent generation mechanism in
   graphene but also suggest new types of terahertz sources based Oil 2D
   nanomaterials.}},

Title = {{Ulnar Neuropathy Among Active Workers Based Upon Hand Diagram Ratings}},
Journal = {{PM\&R}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{571-575}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Limited studies have estimated the prevalence of ulnar
   neuropathy (UN) in the workplace. Hand diagrams have been demonstrated
   to have a good sensitivity and specificity when attempting to identify
   patients with UN.
   Objective: To determine the prevalence and associated risk factors for
   UN among active workers based on results of a hand diagram, and to
   determine the reliability of hand diagram scoring.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Seven different industrial and clerical work sites.
   Methods: A total of 501 active workers were screened. Subjects completed
   a hand diagram and the Job Content Questionnaire, and had ergonomic
   assessment of their job. Each hand diagram was scored independently by 2
   raters.
   Main Outcome Measures: Rating of the hand diagram for UN.
   Results: Interrater reliability of scoring the hand diagram for UN was
   very high. The estimated prevalence of UN was 3.6\%. Suspected UN was
   associated with positioning of the elbow but not by contact stress at
   the elbow or force at the hand. Smokers had a lower prevalence, but
   smokers with suspected UN had higher-pack year histories. Workers with
   suspected UN had a greater sense of job insecurity and lower job
   satisfaction rating.
   Conclusions: Hand diagram rating has a high interrater reliability.
   Suspected UN has a relatively high prevalence among active workers in
   comparison to prior estimates of the prevalence of UN among the general
   population and is not strongly associated with ergonomic factors.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{We report on the development of a hydrothermal synthesis procedure that
   results in the growth of highly aligned arrays of high aspect ratio
   barium titanate nanowires. Using a multiple step, scalable hydrothermal
   reaction, a textured titanium dioxide film is deposited on titanium foil
   upon which highly aligned nanowires are grown via homoepitaxy and
   converted to barium titanate. Scanning electron microscope images
   clearly illustrate the effect the textured film has on the degree of
   orientation of the nanowires. The alignment of nanowires is quantified
   by calculating the Herman's Orientation Factor, which reveals a 58\%
   improvement in orientation as compared to growth in the absence of the
   textured film. The ferroelectric properties of barium titanate combined
   with the development of this scalable growth procedure provide a
   powerful route towards increasing the efficiency and performance of
   nanowire-based devices in future real-world applications such as sensing
   and power harvesting. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Oligonucleotide microarrays allow the production of complex custom
   oligonucleotide libraries for nucleic acid detection-based applications
   such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We have developed a
   PCR-free method to make single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fluorescent probes
   through an intermediate RNA library. A double-stranded oligonucleotide
   library is amplified by transcription to create an RNA library. Next,
   dye-or hapten-conjugate primers are used to reverse transcribe the RNA
   to produce a dye-labeled cDNA library. Finally the RNA is hydrolyzed
   under alkaline conditions to obtain the single-stranded fluorescent
   probes library. Starting from unique oligonucleotide library constructs,
   we present two methods to produce single-stranded probe libraries. The
   two methods differ in the type of reverse transcription (RT) primer, the
   incorporation of fluorescent dye, and the purification of fluorescent
   probes. The first method employs dye-labeled reverse transcription
   primers to produce multiple differentially single-labeled probe subsets
   from one microarray library. The fluorescent probes are purified from
   excess primers by oligonucleotide-bead capture. The second method uses
   an RNA: DNA chimeric primer and amino-modified nucleotides to produce
   amino-allyl probes. The excess primers and RNA are hydrolyzed under
   alkaline conditions, followed by probe purification and labeling with
   amino-reactive dyes. The fluorescent probes created by the combination
   of transcription and reverse transcription can be used for FISH and to
   detect any RNA and DNA targets via hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{High-temperature applications of ceramic matrix composites necessitate a
   rigorous understanding of the fracture and damage mechanisms that occur
   under thermomechanical loading, requiring the development of advanced
   small-scale characterization approaches. In this work, fiber-reinforced
   SiC/SiC tensile specimens were loaded in a scanning electron microscope
   at 800 degrees C, and full-field deformation maps at the constituent
   length scale were generated using digital image correlation (DIC). A
   colloidal system containing mechanically milled titanium nanopowder,
   bicine, and water was developed for use as a DIC tracking pattern that
   is stable at 795 degrees C. The resultant full-field strain maps provide
   a constituent level characterization of damage evolution from crack
   initiation through final fracture. An analysis of strain along fiber
   lengths indicated that fiber mean strain and standard deviation reached
   a minimum at fiber fracture. In addition, multiple matrix cracks in the
   process zone ahead of a notch/crack tip were apparent and could falsely
   appear as a continuous region of high strain in DIC fields. Relatively
   large displacement (strain) error was attributed to noise and bias at
   these small length scales and small strain values, and approaches for
   mitigating this error are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric materials play a significant role in harvesting ambient
   vibration energy. Due to their inherent characteristics and
   electromechanical interaction, the system damping for piezoelectric
   energy harvesting can be adequately characterized by fractional
   calculus. This paper introduces the fractional model for magnetically
   coupling broadband energy harvesters under low-frequency excitation and
   investigates their nonlinear dynamic characteristics. The effects of
   fractional-order damping, excitation amplitude, and frequency on dynamic
   behaviors are proposed using the phase trajectory, power spectrum,
   Poincare map, and bifurcation diagram. The numerical analysis shows that
   the fractionally damped energy harvesting system exhibits chaos,
   periodic motion, chaos and periodic motion in turn when the fractional
   order changes from 0.2 to 1.5. The period doubling route to chaos and
   the inverse period doubling route from chaos to periodic motion can be
   clearly observed. It is also demonstrated numerically and experimentally
   that the magnetically coupling piezoelectric energy harvester possesses
   the usable frequency bandwidth over a wide range of low-frequency
   excitation. Both high-energy chaotic attractors and large-amplitude
   periodic response with inter-well oscillators dominate these broadband
   energy harvesting.}},

   provide thermal-hydraulic feedback for BWR depletion calculations with
   the neutronics code PARCS (Purdue Advanced Reactor Core Simulator). The
   simplified solution methodology, including a three-equation drift flux
   formulation and an optimized iteration scheme, yields very fast run
   times in comparison to conventional thermal-hydraulic systems codes used
   in the industry, while still retaining sufficient accuracy for
   applications such as BWR depletion calculations. The capability to model
   advanced BWR fuel designs with part-length fuel rods and heterogeneous
   axial channel flow geometry has been implemented in PATHS, and the code

Abstract = {{Space and cyberspace operations are primary missions within the U.S.
   Armed Forces. Air Force Space Command performs investment planning for
   Air Force space and cyberspace missions. The command has performed space
   investment planning for more than 15 years using multiobjective decision
   analysis to assess the value of space programs for military operations
   and an optimization model to maximize space capabilities subject to
   performance, budget, schedule, and programmatic constraints. Air Force
   cyberspace operations and investment planning were assigned to Air Force
   Space Command in 2009. We developed an improved cyberspace investment
   analysis method using decision analysis techniques to support investment
   planning for the Air Force's approximately \$3.5 billion annual
   cyberspace investment. We developed four models to assess the value of
   Air Force cyberspace programs: a multiobjective decision analysis model
   for information technology infrastructure, a probability model to assess
   the capability to defend Air Force networks, a probability model to
   assess the capability to command and control cyberspace assets, and a
   probability model to assess the capability to perform cyberspace attacks
   when directed by national command authorities. The models were
   incorporated into the Air Force Space Command Integrated Planning
   Process and have been used for three years.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrothermal diamond anvil cells (HDACs) provide facile means for
   coupling synchrotron X-ray techniques with pressure up to 10 GPa and
   temperature up to 1300 K. This manuscript reports on an application of
   the HDAC as an ambient-pressure sample environment for performing in
   situ defect annealing and thermal expansion studies of swift heavy ion
   irradiated CeO2 and ThO2 using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The
   advantages of the in situ HDAC technique over conventional annealing
   methods include rapid temperature ramping and quench times,
   high-resolution measurement capability, simultaneous annealing of
   multiple samples, and prolonged temperature and apparatus stability at
   high temperatures. Isochronal annealing between 300 and 1100 K revealed
   two-stage and one-stage defect recovery processes for irradiated CeO2
   and ThO2, respectively, indicating that the morphology of the defects
   produced by swift heavy ion irradiation of these two materials differs
   significantly. These results suggest that electronic configuration plays
   a major role in both the radiation-induced defect production and
   high-temperature defect recovery mechanisms of CeO2 and ThO2.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale polymeric fibers are expected to bring about exceptional
   mechanical and optical properties in composite materials related to the
   better integration of different properties between fibers and polymers.
   The discovery of the first aramid nanofiber dispersion from commercial
   para-aramid macrofibers similar to Kevlar (R) developed by DuPont
   allowed the emergence of an innovative nanoscale building block with
   great potential for engineering novel high-performance polymer
   nanocomposites. Here we report the fabrication of aramid
   nanofiber-reinforced polyacrylic-acid thin films using vacuum-assisted
   flocculation. We show that the resulting composite has high transparency
   owing to the nanoscale size of the fibers. The multiple hydrogen bonds
   available at the interface between the polyacrylic acid and nanofibers
   result in significant improvement of mechanical properties, with Young's
   modulus outperforming single-walled carbon nanotube composites. The
   successful use of ANFs in producing transparent, strong and flexible
   polymer nanocomposites indicates their great potential as an effective
   reinforcing agent in optical applications.}},

Abstract = {{There is heterogeneity in how pediatric voiding cystourethrography
   (VCUG) is performed. Some institutions, including our own, obtain a
   radiographic scout image prior to contrast agent instillation.
   To demonstrate that the radiographic scout image does not augment VCUG
   interpretation or contribute management-changing information but
   nonetheless carries a non-negligible effective dose.
   We evaluated 181 children who underwent VCUG in 2012, with an age
   breakdown of less than 1 year (56 children), 1-5 years (66 children),
   6-10 years (43 children) and 11-18 years (16 children), with a mean age
   of 4.0 years. We investigated patient demographics, clinical indication
   for the examination, scout image findings and estimated effective
   radiation dose, as well as overall exam findings and impression.
   No clinically significant or management-changing findings were present
   on scout images, and no radiopaque urinary tract calculi or concerning
   incidental finding was identified. Scout image estimated effective
   radiation dose averaged 0.09 mSv in children younger than 1 y, 0.09 mSv
   in children age 1-5, 0.13 mSv in children age 6-10 and 0.18 mSv in
   children age 11-18. Total fluoroscopy time per examination averaged 36.7
   s (range 34.8-39.6 s for all age group averages). Evaluation of known or
   suspected vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and urinary tract infection (UTI)
   were the most common clinical indications, stated in 40.9\% and 37.0\%
   of exams, respectively.
   Although the estimated effective dose is low for VCUG radiographic scout
   images, this step did not augment VCUG interpretation or contribute
   management-changing information. This step should be omitted or
   substituted to further reduce dose in pediatric VCUG.}},

Abstract = {{Runflat structure plays an important role in determining the sustainable
   mileage after the tire is shot. Lightweight, stiffness and strength are
   highly relevant to the overall performance of the structure. A
   parameterized model was built based on the full study of the structure,
   and a new adaptive meshing method is proposed to ensure the quality of
   the model. The accuracy of the new model was verified by comparing to
   the traditional finite element model. The parameter study was carried
   out to investigate the response of the performance and mass.
   Multi-objective optimization model was established by applying optimal
   Latin square design method and response surface model approach.
   Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was applied to
   obtain the optimization design. The results indicate that the
   combination of parameterized model and multi-objective genetic
   algorithms successfully achieve the goal of multi-objective optimization
   for mass and displacement while ensuring the stress. Meanwhile, the
   optimal topology, shape and thickness optimization for the runflat
   structure have been achieved at the same time.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Recent field data analyses have shown that the safety
   advantages of rear seats relative to the front seats have decreased in
   newer vehicles. Separately, the risks of certain injuries have been
   found to be higher for obese occupants. The objective of this study is
   to investigate the effects of advanced belt features on the protection
   of rear-seat occupants with a range of body mass index (BMI) in frontal
   crashes.
   Methods: Whole-body finite element human models with 4 BMI levels (25,
   30, 35, and 40kg/m(2)) developed previously were used in this study. A
   total of 52 frontal crash simulations were conducted, including 4
   simulations with a standard rear-seat, 3-point belt and 48 simulations
   with advanced belt features. The parameters varied in the simulations
   included BMI, load limit, anchor pretensioner, and lap belt routing
   relative to the pelvis. The injury measurements analyzed in this study
   included head and hip excursions, normalized chest deflection, and torso
   angle (defined as the angle between the hip-shoulder line and the
   vertical direction). Analyses of covariance were used to test the
   significance (P <.05) of the results.
   Results: Higher BMI was associated with greater head and hip excursions
   and larger normalized chest deflection. Higher belt routing increased
   the hip excursion and torso angle, which indicates a higher submarining
   risk, whereas the anchor pretensioner reduced hip excursion and torso
   angle. Lower load limits decreased the normalized chest deflection but
   increased the head excursion. Normalized chest deflection had a positive
   correlation with maximum torso angle. Occupants with higher BMI have to
   use higher load limits to reach head excursions similar to those in
   lower BMI occupants.
   Discussion and Conclusion: The simulation results suggest that
   optimizing load limiter and adding pretensioner(s) can reduce injury
   risks associated with obesity, but conflicting effects on head and chest
   injuries were observed. This study demonstrated the feasibility and
   importance of using human models to investigate protection for occupants
   with various BMI levels. A seat belt system capable of adapting to
   occupant size and body shape will improve protection for obese occupants
   in rear seats.}},

Abstract = {{We present an energy/illumination-adaptive CMOS image sensor for
   distributed wireless sensor applications. The adaptive feature enables
   always-on imaging operation with extremely low power consumption for
   extended lifetime of wireless image sensor nodes and provides optimum
   images in a wide range of illuminations. For adaptive operation, the
   sensor employs reconfigurable modes of operation. Most of time, the
   sensor is in a monitoring mode, which keeps imaging at extremely low
   power consumption. The sensor turns into a high-sensitivity imaging mode
   or a wide dynamic range imaging mode when illumination varies and
   sufficient power supply is available from energy harvesting. The sensor
   changes its operation back to the monitoring mode in order to save
   energy in the battery. The sensor operates at 1.36 mu W/frame in the
   monitoring mode from harvested energy and provides high-sensitive (24
   V/lx . sec) and wide dynamic range images (99.2 dB) at 867 mu W in
   battery operation. The chip achieved power FOM of 15.4 pW/pixel. frame

Abstract = {{Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are circuits that produce outputs
   determined by random physical variations from fabrication. The PUF
   studied in this paper utilizes the variation sensitivity of static
   random access memory (SRAM) data retention voltage (DRV), the minimum
   voltage at which each cell can retain state. Prior work shows that DRV
   can uniquely identify circuit instances with 28\% greater success than
   SRAM power-up states that are used in PUFs {[}1]. However, DRV is highly
   sensitive to temperature, and until now this makes it unreliable and
   unsuitable for use in a PUF. In this paper, we enable DRV PUFs by
   proposing a DRV-based hash function that is insensitive to temperature.
   The new hash function, denoted DRV-based hashing (DH), is reliable
   across temperatures because it utilizes the temperature-insensitive
   ordering of DRVs across cells, instead of using the DRVs in absolute
   terms. To evaluate the security and performance of the DRV PUF, we use
   DRV measurements from commercially available SRAM chips, and use data
   from a novel DRV prediction algorithm. The prediction algorithm uses
   machine learning for fast and accurate simulation-free estimation of any
   cell's DRV, and the prediction error in comparison to circuit simulation
   has a standard deviation of 0.35 mV. We demonstrate the DRV PUF using
   two applications-secret key generation and identification. In secret key
   generation, we introduce a new circuit-level reliability knob as an
   alternative to error correcting codes. In the identification
   application, our approach is compared to prior work and shown to result
   in a smaller false-positive identification rate for any desired
   true-positive identification rate.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing IC manufacturing cost encourages a business model where
   design houses outsource IC fabrication to remote foundries. Despite cost
   savings, this model exposes design houses to IC piracy as remote
   foundries can manufacture in excess to sell on the black market. Recent
   efforts in digital hardware security aim to thwart piracy by using
   XOR-based chip locking, cryptography, and active metering. To counter
   direct attacks and lower the exposure of unlocked circuits to the
   foundry, we introduce a multiplexor-based locking strategy that
   preserves test response allowing IC testing by an untrusted party before
   activation. We demonstrate a simple yet effective attack against a
   locked circuit that does not preserve test response, and validate the
   effectiveness of our locking strategy on IWLS 2005 benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{Shared-memory chip-multiprocessor (CMP) architectures define memory
   consistency models that establish the ordering rules for memory
   operations from multiple threads. Validating the correctness of a CMP's
   implementation of its memory consistency model requires extensive
   monitoring and analysis of memory accesses while multiple threads are
   executing on the CMP. In this paper, we present a low overhead solution
   for observing, recording and analyzing shared-memory interactions for
   use in an emulation and/or post-silicon validation environment. Our
   approach leverages portions of the CMP's own data caches, augmented only
   by a small amount of hardware logic, to log information relevant to
   memory accesses. After transferring this information to a central memory
   location, we deploy our own analysis algorithm to detect any possible
   memory consistency violations. We build on the property that a violation
   corresponds to a cycle in an appropriately defined graph representing
   memory interactions. The solution we propose allows a designer to choose
   where to run the analysis algorithm: 1) on the CMP itself; 2) on a
   separate processor residing on the validation platform; or 3) off-line
   on a separate host machine. Our experimental results show an 83\% bug
   detection rate, in our testbed CMP, over three distinct memory
   consistency models, namely: relaxed-memory order, total-store order, and
   sequential consistency. Finally, note that our solution can be disabled
   in the final product, leading to zero performance overhead and a
   per-core area overhead that is smaller than the size of a physical
   integer register file in a modern processor.}},

Abstract = {{With the aging US population, demographic shifts, and obesity epidemic,
   there is potential for further exacerbation of the current liver donor
   shortage. We aimed to project the availability of liver grafts in the
   United States. We performed a secondary analysis of the Organ
   Procurement and Transplantation Network database of all adult donors
   from 2000 to 2012 and calculated the total number of donors available
   and transplanted donor livers stratified by age, race, and body mass
   index (BMI) group per year. We used National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
   historical data to stratify the general population by age, sex, race,
   and BMI. We then used US population age and race projections provided by
   the US Census Bureau and the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service and
   made national and regional projections of available donors and donor
   liver utilization from 2014 to 2025. We performed sensitivity analyses
   and varied the rate of the rise in obesity, proportion of Hispanics,
   population growth, liver utilization rate, and donation after cardiac
   death (DCD) utilization. The projected adult population growth in the
   United States from 2014 to 2025 will be 7.1\%. However, we project that
   there will be a 6.1\% increase in the number of used liver grafts. There
   is marked regional heterogeneity in liver donor growth. Projections were
   significantly affected by changes in BMI, DCD utilization, and liver
   utilization rates but not by changes in the Hispanic proportion of the
   US population or changes in the overall population growth. Overall
   population growth will outpace the growth of available donor organs and
   thus potentially exacerbate the existing liver graft shortage. The
   projected growth in organs is highly heterogeneous across different
   United Network for Organ Sharing regions. Focused strategies to increase
   the liver donor pool are warranted. Liver Transpl 21:855-863, 2015. (c)

Abstract = {{Each year, approximately 185,000 Americans suffer the devastating loss
   of a limb. The effects of upper limb amputations are profound because a
   person's hands are tools for everyday functioning, expressive
   communication, and other uniquely human attributes. Despite the
   advancements in prosthetic technology, current upper limb prostheses are
   still limited in terms of complex motor control and sensory feedback.
   Sensory feedback is critical to restoring full functionality to
   amputated patients because it would relieve the cognitive burden of
   relying solely on visual input to monitor motor commands and provide
   tremendous psychological benefits. This article reviews the latest
   innovations in sensory feedback and argues in favor of peripheral nerve
   interfaces. First, the authors examine the structure of the peripheral
   nerve and its importance in the development of a sensory interface.
   Second, the authors discuss advancements in targeted muscle
   reinnervation and direct neural stimulation by means of intraneural
   electrodes. The authors then explore the future of prosthetic sensory
   feedback using innovative technologies for neural signaling,
   specifically, the sensory regenerative peripheral nerve interface and
   optogenetics. These breakthroughs pave the way for the development of a
   prosthetic limb with the ability to feel.}},

Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{283-299}},
Month = {{JUN-JUL}},
Abstract = {{Many small satellites are power constrained due to their minimal solar
   panel area and the eclipse environment of low-Earth orbit. As with
   larger satellites, these small satellites, including CubeSats, use
   deployable power arrays to increase power production. This presents a
   design opportunity to develop various objective functions related to
   energy management and methods for optimizing these functions over a
   satellite design. A novel power generation model was created, and a
   simulation system was developed to evaluate various objective functions
   describing energy management for complex satellite designs. The model
   uses a spacecraft-body-fixed spherical coordinate system to analyze the
   complex geometry of a satellite's self-induced shadowing with
   computation provided by the Open Graphics Library. As an example design
   problem, a CubeSat configured as a space-dart with four deployable
   panels is optimized. Due to the fast computation speed of the solution,
   an exhaustive search over the design space is used to find the solar
   panel deployment angles which maximize total power generation.
   Simulation results are presented for a variety of orbit scenarios. The
   method is extendable to a variety of complex satellite geometries and
   power generation systems. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Distributed Coordination of Co-Channel Femtocells via Inter-Cell

Abstract = {{To achieve high spatial reuse of spectrum resources with limited
   inter-layer/cell interference, co-channel femtocells must be coordinated
   with the underlying macro-and other femtocells in using radio resources.
   While inter-cell signaling can coordinate femtocells by providing the
   status information of neighbor cells explicitly, signaling delay-which
   may result from a limited signaling rate to reduce the resulting
   overhead, network latency, etc.-and its impact on the behavior of
   distributed coordination has not been explored before. In this paper, we
   propose a new architecture for the distributed coordination of
   co-channel femtocells based on asynchronous inter-cell signaling, called
   asynchronous coordination of co-channel femtocells (ACoF). ACoF improves
   solutions iteratively; femtocells update radio resource usage based on
   the received information, which usually gets outdated due to delayed
   signaling and asynchronous update behavior. ACoF allows each femtocell
   to adjust its signaling rate depending on its local conditions for
   fine-grained cost minimization, but at the expense of higher degree of
   inconsistency of femtocells' knowledge. Despite such asynchrony and
   inconsistency, the solution yielded by ACoF is guaranteed to converge to
   a global optimum under a certain condition of configuration parameters,
   which we prove theoretically. We design the optimization method of
   per-cell signaling rate for both wired and over-the-air signaling.
   Finally, we present a joint muting and transmit power adjustment scheme
   designed for ACoF and evaluate its convergence behavior and performance
   gain.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular nonlinear/neural network (CNN) has been recognized as a
   powerful massively parallel architecture capable of solving complex
   engineering problems by performing trillions of analog operations per
   second. The memristor was theoretically predicted in the late seventies,
   but it garnered nascent research interest due to the recent
   much-acclaimed discovery of nanocrossbar memories by engineers at the
   Hewlett-Packard Laboratory. The memristor is expected to be
   co-integrated with nanoscale CMOS technology to revolutionize
   conventional von Neumann as well as neuromorphic computing. In this
   paper, a compact CNN model based on memristors is presented along with
   its performance analysis and applications. In the new CNN design, the
   memristor bridge circuit acts as the synaptic circuit element and
   substitutes the complex multiplication circuit used in traditional CNN
   architectures. In addition, the negative differential resistance and
   nonlinear current-voltage characteristics of the memristor have been
   leveraged to replace the linear resistor in conventional CNNs. The
   proposed CNN design has several merits, for example, high density,
   nonvolatility, and programmability of synaptic weights. The proposed
   memristor-based CNN design operations for implementing several image
   processing functions are illustrated through simulation and contrasted
   with conventional CNNs. Monte-Carlo simulation has been used to
   demonstrate the behavior of the proposed CNN due to the variations in
   memristor synaptic weights.}},

Abstract = {{Improving the structural integrity of bone reduces fracture risk and
   development of osteoporosis later in life. Exercise can increase the
   mechanical properties of bone, and this increase is often attributed to
   the dynamic loading created during exercise. However, the increase in
   systemic parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels during exercise gives reason
   to hypothesize that PTH signaling also regulates bone adaptation in
   response to exercise. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to
   establish the impact PTH signaling has on bone adaptation during
   exercise by inhibiting PTH signaling with PTH(7-34); the second aim was
   to determine whether increasing PTH levels during exercise with
   PTH(1-34) can augment bone adaptation. Thirty minutes after a single
   bout of running on a treadmill, mice exhibited a twofold increase in
   systemic PTH levels. Under the same exercise regimen, the influence of
   PTH signaling on bone adaptation during exercise was then evaluated in
   mice after 21 consecutive days of exercise and treatment with PTH(7-34),
   PTH(1-34), or vehicle. Exercise alone caused a significant increase in
   trabecular bone volume with adaptation to a more platelike structure,
   which was inhibited with PTH(7-34) during exercise. Changes in
   structural-level and tissue-level mechanical properties during exercise
   occurred in the absence of significant changes to cortical bone
   geometry. Inhibition of PTH signaling during exercise attenuated the
   changes in structural-level mechanical properties, but not tissue-level
   properties. Enhanced PTH signaling during exercise with PTH(1-34)
   increased trabecular and cortical bone volume, but had little effect on
   the structural-level and tissue-level mechanical properties compared to
   exercise alone. Our study is the first to demonstrate that bone
   adaptation during exercise is not only a function of dynamic loading,
   but also PTH release, and that PTH signaling contributes differently at
   the structural and tissue levels. (c) 2015 American Society for Bone and

Abstract = {{The strong interaction of electromagnetic fields with plasmonic
   nanomaterials offers opportunities in various technologies that take
   advantage of photophysical processes amplified by this light-matter
   interaction. Recently, it has been shown that in addition to
   photophysical processes, optically excited plasmonic nanoparticles can
   also activate chemical transformations directly on their surfaces. This
   potentially offers a number of opportunities in the field of selective
   chemical synthesis. In this Review we summarize recent progress in the
   field of photochemical catalysis on plasmonic metallic nanostructures.
   We discuss the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the
   observed chemical activity, and the issues that must be better
   understood to see progress in the field of plasmon-mediated
   photocatalysis.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic noise of the front-end preamplifier can potentially limit
   the energy and position resolutions of radiation sensors, a detrimental
   effect that can be diminished by the use of on-chip amplification. The
   implementation of an avalanching structure upon a direct-conversion
   semiconductor-based radiation detector is modeled and demonstrated using
   high-resistivity silicon. The avalanche particle sensor configuration is
   designed analytically, and we validated the design with numerical
   process and device simulations. Process and device simulation results
   from the sensors modeled with various geometries, doping profile
   arrangements, and fabrication conditions are reported. We tested the
   refined numerical design by fabricating and testing diagnostic sensors.
   Multiplication junctions, based on a junction termination extension
   design, were created from micrometer-scale highly-doped layers on
   silicon wafers using both diffusion and ion implantation techniques. For
   <100 keV energy depositions, our modeling has shown that a gain of
   similar to 8 is ideal if one is attempting to optimize the SNR, which is
   realized in the experimental detectors at an excess bias of 3 V. At that
   voltage, the energy resolution for 81 keV gammarays can, in principle,
   be reduced from 2.12\% to 0.96\% (for a k(alpha)=0.2 device), the degree
   of improvement limited by the leakage current of the devices, and within
   a factor of 2 of the ultimate Fano limit (0.53\%). (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Superheated emulsion detectors are suspensions of metastable liquid
   droplets in a compliant inert medium. Upon interaction with ionizing
   radiation, the droplets evaporate, generating visible bubbles. Bubble
   expansion associated with the boiling of the droplets is accompanied by
   pressure pulses in both the sonic and ultrasonic frequency range. In
   this work, we analyzed the signal generated by bubble evaporation in the
   frequency and time domain. We used octafluoropropane (R-218) based
   emulsions, sensitive to both photons and neutrons. The frequency content
   of the detected pulses appears to extend well into the hundreds of kHz,
   beyond the range used in commercial devices to count bubbles as they are
   formed (typically 1-10 kHz). Kilohertz components characterize the early
   part of the waveforms, potentially containing information about the
   energetics of the explosive bubble initial growth phase. The power
   spectral density of the acoustic signal produced by neutron-induced
   evaporation shows a characteristic frequency pattern in the 200-400 kHz
   range, which is not observed when bubbles evaporate upon gamma
   ray-induced irradiation. For practical applications, detection of
   ultrasonic pulses associated with the boiling of the superheated drops
   can be exploited as a fast readout method, negligibly affected by
   mechanical ambient noise. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical analyses have been performed to develop bounding estimates
   of the expected performance of a conceptual fast-neutron multiplicity
   system (FNMS) for assaying plutonium. The conceptual FNMS design
   includes 32 cubic liquid scintillator detectors, measuring 7.62 cm per
   side, configured into 4 stacked rings of 8 detectors each. Expected
   response characteristics for the individual FNMS detectors, as well as
   the response characteristics of the entire FNMS, were determined using
   Monte Carlo simulations based on prior validation experiments. The
   results from these simulations were then used to estimate the Pu assay
   capabilities of the FNMS in terms of counting time, assay mass, and
   assay mass variance, using assay mass variance as a figure of merit. The
   analysis results are compared against a commonly used thermal-neutron
   coincidence counter. The advantages of using a fast-neutron counting
   system versus a thermal-neutron counting system are significant. Most
   notably, the time required to perform an assay to an equivalent assay
   mass variance is greatly reduced with a fast-neutron system, by more
   than an order of magnitude compared with that of the thermal-neutron
   system, due to the reduced probability of random summing with the fast
   system. The improved FNMS performance is especially relevant for assays
   involving Pu masses of 10 g or more. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{New organic-plastic scintillation compositions have demonstrated
   pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) of neutrons and gamma rays. We present
   cross-correlation measurements of Cf-252 and mixed uranium-plutonium
   oxide (MOX) with the EJ-299-33 plastic scintillator. For comparison,
   equivalent measurements were performed with an EJ-309 liquid
   scintillator. Offline, digital PSD was applied to each detector. These
   measurements show that EJ-299-33 sacrifices a factor of 5 in
   neutron-neutron efficiency relative to EJ-309, but could still utilize
   the difference in neutron-neutron efficiency and neutron
   single-to-double ratio to distinguish Cf-252 from MOX.
   These measurements were modeled with MCNPX-PoliMi, and MPPost was used
   to convert the detailed collision history into simulated
   cross-correlation distributions. MCNPX-PoliMi predicted the measured
   Cf-252 cross-correlation distribution for EJ-309 to within 10\%. Greater
   photon uncertainty in the MOX sample led to larger discrepancy in the
   simulated MOX cross-correlation distribution. The modeled EJ-299-33
   plastic also gives reasonable agreement with measured cross-correlation
   distributions, although the MCNPX-PoliMi model appears to under-predict
   the neutron detection efficiency. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this study we explore the use of impediographic techniques to perform
   damage detection in plate-like metal structures. Impediography relies on
   the piezo-resistive coupling of the host structure to reconstruct high
   sensitivity and high resolution maps of the internal electrical
   conductivity. By exploiting localized strain perturbations generated via
   focused acoustic waves, the piezo-resistive coupling allows extracting a
   set of linearly independent boundary voltage data that drastically
   reduces the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem, therefore
   increasing the performance. The localized perturbation is achieved by
   leveraging the concept of frequency selective structure (FSS), that is a
   dynamically tailored structural element enabling the required acoustic
   focusing via vibration localization. Based on the FSS approach, the
   impediographic technique is numerically tested to investigate the
   performance of the combined approach for structural damage detection.
   The effects of practical implementation issues, such as limited
   perturbations and limited boundary data, are also explored.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical intervention is often required to restore knee instability in
   patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The most commonly
   used grafts for ACL reconstruction are tendon autografts or allografts.
   These current options, however, have shown failure rates requiring
   revision and continued instability in the long term. The mismatched
   biomechanical properties of the current tendon grafts compared with
   native ACL tissue are thought to contribute to these poor outcomes and
   potential risk of early onset osteoarthritis. As a possible solution to
   these issues, our laboratory has fabricated tissue-engineered ligament
   constructs that exhibit structural and functional properties similar to
   those of native ACL tissue after 6 months implantation. In addition,
   these tissue-engineered grafts achieve vascular and neural development
   that exceeds those of patellar tendon grafts. However, the utility of
   our tissue-engineered grafts is limited by the labor-intensive method
   required to produce the constructs and the need to use the constructs
   fresh, directly from the cell culturing system. Ideally, these
   constructs would be fabricated and stored until needed. Thus, in this
   study, we investigated the efficacy of freezing our tissue-engineered
   constructs as a method of preservation before use for ACL
   reconstruction. We hypothesized that frozen constructs would have
   similar histological and biomechanical outcomes compared with our fresh
   model. Our results showed that 6 months postimplantation as an ACL
   replacement graft, both our tissue-engineered fresh and frozen grafts
   demonstrated similar mechanical and histological outcomes, indicating
   that freezing is a suitable method for preserving and storing our graft
   before ACL reconstruction. The ability to use frozen constructs
   significantly increases the versatility of our graft technology
   expanding the clinical utility of our graft.}},

Title = {{Clutter in Electronic Medical Records: Examining Its Performance and
   Attentional Costs Using Eye Tracking}},
Journal = {{HUMAN FACTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{591-606}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The objective was to use eye tracking to trace the underlying
   changes in attention allocation associated with the performance effects
   of clutter, stress, and task difficulty in visual search and noticing
   tasks.
   Background: Clutter can degrade performance in complex domains, yet more
   needs to be known about the associated changes in attention allocation,
   particularly in the presence of stress and for different tasks.
   Frequently used and relatively simple eye tracking metrics do not
   effectively capture the various effects of clutter, which is critical
   for comprehensively analyzing clutter and developing targeted, real-time
   countermeasures.
   Method: Electronic medical records (EMRs) were chosen as the application
   domain for this research. Clutter, stress, and task difficulty were
   manipulated, and physicians' performance on search and noticing tasks
   was recorded. Several eye tracking metrics were used to trace attention
   allocation throughout those tasks, and subjective data were gathered via
   a debriefing questionnaire.
   Results: Clutter degraded performance in terms of response time and
   noticing accuracy. These decrements were largely accentuated by high
   stress and task difficulty. Eye tracking revealed the underlying
   attentional mechanisms, and several display-independent metrics were
   shown to be significant indicators of the effects of clutter.
   Conclusion: Eye tracking provides a promising means to understand in
   detail (offline) and prevent (in real time) major performance breakdowns
   due to clutter.
   Application: Display designers need to be aware of the risks of clutter
   in EMRs and other complex displays and can use the identified eye
   tracking metrics to evaluate and/or adjust their display.}},

Abstract = {{In the field weakening region, the voltage is utilized to the maximum to
   minimize the current amplitude. In this paper, the hexagonal voltage
   limit is considered to increase the voltage and to decrease the current,
   as a result to reduce the copper loss. At first, an intersection between
   the hexagonal voltage limit and torque curve was found. Because the
   intersection lies on the boundary of the hexagon, the equations of the
   sides of the hexagon were derived. Since the hexagonal voltage limit
   rotates in the synchronous reference frame, they are a function of the
   rotor position. Finally, the voltage angle was calculated from the
   intersection. To reduce the torque ripple, d-axis current feedback was
   added to the voltage angle. In the simulation and experiment results, an
   increase of voltage and a decrease of current were observed. In
   addition, an improvement of the motor and inverter efficiencies was also
   achieved.}},

   determine nonlinear viscoelastic properties}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{8-17}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Experimental results obtained by compressing fluid-filled polymeric
   capsules between two flat, parallel plates, are analyzed to obtain
   information on the capsule wall material properties. Reaction
   force-displacement-time response of the capsule and the contact area
   during the compression process are recorded and fitted by an inverse
   analysis. This inverse analysis is a surrogate model based on a Kriging
   estimator. It is built upon optimizing the error between simulated
   force-time responses from a finite element (FE) model of the experiment
   with the corresponding experimental data. In addition, the contact area
   information during the compression test is also used to give more
   insight into the modeling of the problem. Since the capsule is subjected
   to large relative displacements of the top plate, material and geometric
   non-linearity are incorporated in the FE model. As observed from
   experiments, the capsule material exhibits time-dependent
   characteristics. Therefore, in this study, a nonlinear viscoelastic
   (NLV) constitutive relation for modeling the capsule shell material is
   employed. The enclosed fluid is assumed to be incompressible and in a
   steady state. Combining the FE model and the Kriging estimator allowed
   for an automatic identification of the NLV properties of capsule walls
   from a general 3D compression test. The study can be extended to the
   characterization of the nonlinear viscoelastic characteristics of
   biological cells which might be applicable for the purpose of
   establishing biomarkers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We have previously shown that BMP-2 induces bone formation and inhibits
   tumorigenicity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in a human osteosarcoma
   OS99-1 cell line. In this study, we sought to determine whether BMP-2
   can similarly induce bone formation and inhibit the tumorigenicity of
   renal CSCs identified based on aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in
   renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines and primary tumors.
   Using a xenograft model in which cells from human RCC cell lines ACHN,
   Caki-2, and primary tumors were grown in NOD/SCID mice, renal CSCs were
   identified as a subset of ALDH(br) cells. The ALDH(br) cells possessed a
   greater colony-forming efficiency, higher proliferative output,
   increased expression of stem cell marker genes Oct3/4A, Nanog, renal
   embryonic marker Pax-2, and greater tumorigenicity compared to cells
   with low ALDH activity (ALDH(lo) cells), generating new tumors with as
   few as 25 cells in mice.
   In vitro, BMP-2 was found to inhibit the ALDH(br) cell growth,
   down-regulate the expression of embryonic stem cell markers, and
   up-regulate the transcription of osteogenic markers. In vivo, all
   animals receiving a low number of ALDH(br) cells (5 x 10(3)) from ACHN,
   Caki-2, and primary tumor xenografts treated with 30 A mu g BMP-2 per
   animal showed limited tumor growth with significant bone formation,
   while untreated cells developed large tumor masses without bone
   formation.
   These results suggest that BMP-2 inhibits the tumor-initiating ability
   of renal CSCs and induces osseous bone formation. BMP-2 may therefore
   provide a beneficial strategy for human RCC treatment by targeting the
   CSC-enriched population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Bayesian algorithm for linear spectral unmixing of
   hyperspectral images that accounts for anomalies present in the data.
   The model proposed assumes that the pixel reflectances are linear
   mixtures of unknown endmembers, corrupted by an additional nonlinear
   term modeling anomalies, and additive Gaussian noise. A Markov random
   field is used for anomaly detection based on the spatial and spectral
   structures of the anomalies. This allows outliers to be identified in
   particular regions and wavelengths of the data cube. A Bayesian
   algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameters involved in the model
   yielding a joint linear unmixing and anomaly detection algorithm.
   Simulations conducted with synthetic and real hyperspectral images
   demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed unmixing and outlier detection
   strategy for the analysis of hyperspectral images.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient nanomedical platform that can combine two-photon cell
   imaging, near infrared (NIR) light and pH dual responsive drug delivery,
   and photothermal treatment was successfully developed based on
   fluorescent porous carbon-nanocapsules (FPC-NCs, size similar to 100 nm)
   with carbon dots (CDs) embedded in the shell. The stable, excitation
   wavelength (lambda(ex))-tunable and upconverted fluorescence from the
   CDs embedded in the porous carbon shell enable the FPC-NCs to serve as
   an excellent confocal and two-photon imaging contrast agent under the
   excitation of laser with a broad range of wavelength from ultraviolet
   (UV) light (405 nm) to NIR light (900 nm). The FPC-NCs demonstrate a
   very high loading capacity (1335 mg g(-1)) toward doxorubicin drug
   benefited from the hollow cavity structure, porous carbon shell, as well
   as the supramolecular pi stacking and electrostatic interactions between
   the doxorubicin molecules and carbon shell. In addition, a responsive
   release of doxorubicin from the FPC-NCs can be activated by lowering the
   pH to acidic (from 7.4 to 5.0) due to the presence of pH-sensitive
   carboxyl groups on the FPC-NCs and amino groups on doxorubicin
   molecules. Furthermore, the FPC-NCs can absorb and effectively convert
   the NIR light to heat, thus, manifest the ability of NIR-responsive drug
   release and combined photothermal/chemo-therapy for high therapeutic
   efficacy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest (I-HCA) remains < 30 \%. There
   is very limited literature exploring the electrocardiogram changes prior
   to I-HCA. The purpose of the study was to determine demographics and
   electrocardiographic predictors prior to I-HCA. A retrospective study
   was conducted among 39 cardiovascular subjects who had cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation from I-HCA with initial rhythms of pulseless electrical
   activity (PEA) and asystole. Demographics including medical history,
   ejection fraction, laboratory values, and medications were examined.
   Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters from telemetry were studied to
   identify changes in heart rate, QRS duration and morphology, and time of
   occurrence and location of ST segment changes prior to I-HCA. Increased
   age was significantly associated with failure to survive to discharge (p
   < 0.05). Significant change was observed in heart rate including a
   downtrend of heart rate within 15 min prior to I-HCA (p < 0.05). There
   was a significant difference in heart rate and QRS duration during the
   last hour prior to I-HCA compared to the previous hours (p < 0.05).
   Inferior ECG leads showed the most significant changes in QRS morphology
   and ST segments prior to I-HCA (p < 0.05). Subjects with an initial
   rhythm of asystole demonstrated significantly greater ECG changes
   including QRS morphology and ST segment changes compared to the subjects
   with initial rhythms of PEA (p < 0.05). Diagnostic ECG trends can be
   identified prior to I-HCA due to PEA and asystole and can be further
   utilized for training a predictive machine learning model for I-HCA.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in manufacturing automotive lithium-ion
   batteries and battery packs is to achieve consistent weld quality in
   joining multiple layers of dissimilar materials. While most fusion
   welding processes face difficulties in such joining, ultrasonic welding
   stands out as the ideal method. However, inconsistency of weld quality
   still exists because of limited knowledge on the weld formation through
   the multiple interfaces. This study aims to establish real-time
   phenomenological observation on the multilayer ultrasonic welding
   process by analyzing the vibration behavior of metal layers. Such
   behavior is characterized by a direct measurement of the lateral
   displacement of each metal layer using high-speed images. Two different
   weld tools are used in order to investigate the effect of tool geometry
   on the weld formation mechanism and the overall joint quality. A series
   of microscopies and bond density measurements is carried out to validate
   the observations and hypotheses of those phenomena in multilayer
   ultrasonic welding. The results of this study enhance the understanding
   of the ultrasonic welding process of multiple metal sheets and provide
   insights for optimum tool design to improve the quality of multilayer
   joints.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A major barrier in consumer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is
   ``range anxiety,{''} the concern that the vehicle will run out of power
   at an inopportune time. Range anxiety is caused by the current
   relatively low electric-only operational range and sparse public
   charging station (CS) infrastructure. Range anxiety may be significantly
   mitigated if EV manufacturers and CS operators work in partnership using
   a cooperative business model to balance EV performance and CS coverage.
   This model is in contrast to a sequential decision-making model where
   manufacturers bring new EVs to the market first and CS operators decide
   on CS deployment given EV specifications and market demand. This paper
   proposes an integrated decision-making framework to assess profitability
   of a cooperative business model using a multidisciplinary optimization
   model that combines marketing, engineering, and operations
   considerations. This model is demonstrated in a case study involving
   battery EV design and direct current (DC) fast-CS location network in
   Southeast Michigan. The expected benefits can motive both government and
   private enterprise actions.}},

Abstract = {{Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) has shown significant potential in many
   areas of medicine to provide new physiologic markers. Several acute and
   chronic diseases are accompanied by changes in intra-and extracellular
   fluid within various areas of the human body. The estimation of fluid in
   various body compartments is therefore a simple and convenient method to
   monitor certain disease states. In this work, the design and evaluation
   of a BIS instrument are presented and three key areas of the development
   process investigated facilitating the BIS measurement of tissue
   hydration state. First, the benefit of incorporating DC-stabilizing
   circuitry to the standard modified Howland current pump (MHCP) is
   investigated to minimize the effect of DC offsets limiting the dynamic
   range of the system. Second, the influence of the distance between the
   bioimpedance probe and a high impedance material is investigated using
   finite element analysis (FEA). Third, an analytic compensation technique
   is presented to minimize the influence of parasitic capacitance.
   Finally, the overall experimental setup is evaluated through ex vivo BIS
   measurements of porcine spleen tissue and compared to published results.
   The DC-stabilizing circuit demonstrated its ability to maintain DC
   offsets at less than 650 mu V through 100 kHz while maintaining an
   output impedance of 1 M Omega from 100 Hz to 100 kHz. The proximity of a
   bioimpedance probe to a high impedance material such as acrylic was
   shown to increase measured impedance readings by a factor of 4x as the
   ratio of the distance between the sensing electrodes to the distance
   between the bioimpedance probe and acrylic reached 1:3. The average
   parasitic capacitance for the circuit presented was found to be 712 +/-
   128 pF, and the analytic compensation method was shown to be able to
   minimize this effect on the BIS measurements. Measurements of porcine
   spleen tissue showed close correlation with experimental results
   reported in published articles. This research presents the successful
   design and evaluation of a BIS instrument. Specifically, robust
   measurements were obtained by implementing a DC-stabilized current
   source, investigating probe-material proximity issues and compensating
   for parasitic capacitance. These strategies were shown to provide tissue
   measurements comparable with published literature.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics of a longitudinally vibrating rod are analyzed from a wave
   standpoint, in which the motion of the rod is described in terms of
   waves that propagate through the uniform rod and are reflected and
   transmitted at structural discontinuities and boundaries. This study is
   based on the four engineering theories, namely, the elementary, Love,
   Mindlin-Herrmann, and three-mode theories. The propagation relations
   that are governed by the equations of motion are derived. The reflection
   and transmission relations, which are dependent upon the continuity and
   equilibrium conditions at structural discontinuities, are obtained.
   Waves generated by externally applied forces are found. The wave
   propagation, reflection, and transmission relations are assembled to
   provide a concise and systematic approach to vibration analysis of rods.
   Numerical examples are presented. Comparisons and recommendations are
   made for meaningful engineering practice.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy is an ultrasound ablation method that depends on the
   initiation of a cavitation bubble cloud to fractionate soft tissue.
   Previous work has indicated that a cavitation cloud can be formed by a
   single pulse with one high-amplitude negative cycle, when the negative
   pressure amplitude directly exceeds a pressure threshold intrinsic to
   the medium. We hypothesize that the intrinsic threshold in water-based
   tissues is determined by the properties of the water inside the tissue,
   and changes in tissue stiffness or ultrasound frequency will have a
   minimal impact on the histotripsy intrinsic threshold. To test this
   hypothesis, the histotripsy intrinsic threshold was investigated both
   experimentally and theoretically. The probability of cavitation was
   measured by subjecting tissue phantoms with adjustable mechanical
   properties and ex vivo tissues to a histotripsy pulse of 1-2 cycles
   produced by 345-kHz, 500-kHz, 1.5-MHz and 3-MHz histotripsy transducers.
   Cavitation was detected and characterized by passive cavitation
   detection and high-speed photography, from which the probability of
   cavitation was measured versus pressure amplitude. The results revealed
   that the intrinsic threshold (the negative pressure at which probability
   = 0.5) is independent of stiffness for Young's moduli (E) <1 MPa, with
   only a small increase (similar to 2-3 MPa) in the intrinsic threshold
   for tendon (E = 380 MPa). Additionally, results for all samples revealed
   only a small increase of similar to 2-3 MPa when the frequency was
   increased from 345 kHz to 3 MHz. The intrinsic threshold was measured to
   be between 24.7 and 30.6 MPa for all samples and frequencies tested in
   this study. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the
   intrinsic threshold to initiate a histotripsy bubble cloud is not
   significantly affected by tissue stiffness or ultrasound frequency in
   the hundreds of kilohertz to megahertz range. (E-mail:

   performance, which further facilitates photoacoustic imaging and sensing
   applications. By carefully designing and fabricating the imprint mold,
   the imprinted polymer microring has a quality factor on the order of 105
   at 780 nm. The device has advantages such as wide acoustic bandwidth
   response from dc to 350 MHz at -3 dB, low noise equivalent detectable

Abstract = {{Safe and high-efficiency gene therapy for nucleus pulposus (NP)
   regeneration was urgently desired to treat disc degeneration-associated
   diseases. In this work, an efficient nonviral cationic block copolymer
   gene delivery system was used to deliver therapeutic plasmid DNA (pDNA),
   which was prepared via complexation between the mixed cationic block
   copolymers, poly(ethylene
   glycol)-block-poly\{N-{[}N-(2-aminoethyl)-2-aminoehtyl]aspartamide)
   IPEG-b-PAsp(DET)] and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-block-PAsp(DET)
   {[}PNIPAM-b-PAsp(DET)], and pDNA at 25 degrees C. The mixed polyplex
   micelles (MPMs) containing heterogeneous coronas with hydrophobic and
   hydrophilic microdomains coexisting could be obtained upon heating from
   25 to 37 degrees C, which showed high tolerability against nuclease and
   strong resistance towards protein adsorption. The gene transfection
   efficiency of MPMs in NP cells was significantly higher than that of
   regular polyplex micelles prepared from sole block copolymer of
   PEG-b-PAsp(DET) (SPMs) in in vitro and in vivo evaluation due to the
   synergistic effect of improved colloidal stability and low cytotoxicity.
   High expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in NP cells transfected by
   MPMs loading HO-1 pDNA significantly decreased the expression activity
   of matrix metalloproteinases 3 (MMP-3) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
   induced by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and simultaneously increased
   the NP phenotype-associated genes such as aggrecan, type II collagen,
   and SOX-9. Moreover, the therapeutic effects of MPMs loading pDNA were
   tested to treat disc degeneration induced by stab injury. The results
   demonstrated that administration of HO-1 pDNA carried by MPMs in rat
   tail discs apparently reduced inflammatory responses induced by need
   stab and increased glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content, finally achieving
   better therapeutic efficacy as compared with SPMs. Consequently, MPMs
   loading HO-1 pDNA were demonstrated to be potential as a safe and
   high-efficiency nonviral gene delivery system for retarding or
   regenerating the degenerative discs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide promising resources for
   regenerating tissues and organs and modeling development and diseases in
   vitro. To fulfill their promise, the fate, function, and organization of
   hPSCs need to be precisely regulated in a three-dimensional (3D)
   environment to mimic cellular structures and functions of native tissues
   and organs. In the past decade, innovations in 3D culture systems with
   functional biomaterials have enabled efficient and versatile control of
   hPSC fate at the cellular level. However, we are just at the beginning
   of bringing hPSC-based regeneration and development and disease modeling
   to the tissue and organ levels. In this review, we summarize existing
   bioengineered culture platforms for controlling hPSC fate and function
   by regulating inductive mechanical and biochemical cues coexisting in
   the synthetic cell microenvironment. We highlight recent excitements in
   developing 3D hPSC-based in vitro tissue and organ models with in
   vivolike cellular structures, interactions, and functions. We further
   discuss an emerging multifaceted mechanotransductive signaling network
   with transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ at the center stage that
   regulate fates and behaviors of mammalian cells, including hPSCs. Future
   development of 3D biomaterial systems should incorporate dynamically
   modulated mechanical and chemical properties targeting specific
   intracellular signaling events leading to desirable hPSC fate patterning
   and functional tissue formation in 3D. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{An adaptive middleware design to support the dynamic interpretation of
   domain-specific models}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{21-41}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Context: As the use of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs)
   continues to gain popularity, we have developed new ways to execute DSML
   models. The most popular approach is to execute code resulting from a
   model-to-code transformation. An alternative approach is to directly
   execute these models using a semantic-rich execution engine -
   Domain-Specific Virtual Machine (DSVM). The DSVM includes a middleware
   layer responsible for the delivery of services in a given domain.
   Objective: We will investigate an approach that performs the dynamic
   combination of constructs in the middleware layer of DSVMs to support
   the delivery of domain-specific services. This middleware should
   provide: (a) a model of execution (MoE) that dynamically integrates
   decoupled domain-specific knowledge (DSK) for service delivery, (b)
   runtime adaptability based on context and available resources, and (c)
   the same level of operational assurance as any DSVM middleware. Method:
   Our approach will involve (1) defining a framework that supports the
   dynamic combination of MoE and DSK and (2) demonstrating the
   applicability of our framework in the DSVM middleware for user-centric
   communication. We will measure the overhead of our approach and provide
   a cost-benefit analysis factoring in its runtime adaptability using
   appropriate experimentation.
   Results: Our experiments show that combining the DSK and MoE for a DSVM
   middleware allow us to realize efficient specialization while
   maintaining the required operability. We also show that the overhead
   introduced by adaptation is not necessarily deleterious to overall
   performance in a domain as it may result in more efficient operation
   selection.
   Conclusion: The approach defined for the DSVM middleware allows for
   greater flexibility in service delivery while reducing the complexity of
   application development for the user. These benefits are achieved at the
   expense of increased execution times, however this increase may be
   negligible depending on the domain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A dynamic discretization method for reliability inference in Dynamic

Abstract = {{The material and modeling parameters that drive structural reliability
   analysis for marine structures are subject to a significant uncertainty.
   This is especially true when time-dependent degradation mechanisms such
   as structural fatigue cracking are considered. Through inspection and
   monitoring, information such as crack location and size can be obtained
   to improve these parameters and the corresponding reliability estimates.
   Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) are a powerful and flexible tool to
   model dynamic system behavior and update reliability and uncertainty
   analysis with life cycle data for problems such as fatigue cracking.
   However, a central challenge in using DBNs is the need to discretize
   certain types of continuous random variables to perform network
   inference while still accurately tracking low-probability failure
   events. Most existing discretization methods focus on getting the
   overall shape of the distribution correct, with less emphasis on the
   tail region. Therefore, a novel scheme is presented specifically to
   estimate the likelihood of low-probability failure events. The scheme is
   an iterative algorithm which dynamically partitions the discretization
   intervals at each iteration. Through applications to two stochastic
   crack-growth example problems, the algorithm is shown to be robust and
   accurate. Comparisons are presented between the proposed approach and
   existing methods for the discretization problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The Special Power Excursion Reactor Test (SPERT) III E-Core is a small

   code KENO and the deterministic 3D transport code MPACT. All components
   including fuel assemblies, control rods, transient rod, flux
   suppressors, grid spacers and dummy spacer assemblies were explicitly
   modeled. Calculations were performed for cold zero power (CZP) and hot
   zero power (HZP) critical conditions of the core. Numerical results
   indicate that both models were able to achieve very good agreement with
   experimental measurements for both eigenvalue and control rod worths,
   and good agreement was obtained with each other with respect to fission

Abstract = {{Light scattering in photopolymerizable ceramic suspensions affects the

   doses were determined. The volume fraction of powder has no effect on
   the broadening depth; the solids loading can be varied without concern
   for increased scattering within the suspension. The broadening depth
   decreases with the logarithm of RI contrast. Suspensions with a small RI
   contrast are able to cure deep, narrow features without broadening. (C)

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{Memristors have emerged as a promising candidate for critical
   applications such as non-volatile memory as well as non-Von Neumann
   computing architectures based on neuromorphic and machine learning
   systems. In this study, we demonstrate that memristors can be used to
   perform principal component analysis (PCA), an important technique for
   machine learning and data feature learning. The conductance changes of
   memristors in response to voltage pulses are studied and modeled with an
   internal state variable to trace the analog behavior of the device.
   Unsupervised, online learning is achieved in a memristor crossbar using
   Sanger's learning rule, a derivative of Hebb's rule, to obtain the
   principal components. The details of weights evolution during training
   is investigated over learning epochs as a function of training
   parameters. The effects of device non-uniformity on the PCA network
   performance are further analyzed. We show that the memristor-based PCA
   network is capable of linearly separating distinct classes from sensory
   data with high clarification success of 97.6\% even in the presence of
   large device variations.}},

Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{Self-healing of pores in Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)s (PLGA) plays an
   important role in the encapsulation and controlled release of drugs from
   PLGA microparticles. Despite the importance of this phenomenon, neither
   the mechanics of the deformation nor the material properties that
   control it have been fully studied. In this study, the material
   properties of PLGA have been characterized using mechanical tests, and a
   finite-element model has been developed to predict how pores heal. This
   model assumes that the healing process occurs by viscous flow resulting
   from the deviatoric stress field induced by the interaction between the
   surface curvature and the surface tension of the PLGA. The simulations,
   which incorporate measured material properties, show good agreement with
   experimental observations. However, annealing processes that occur over
   prolonged times increase the viscosity and slow the healing times of
   PLGA films at intermediate temperatures above the glass-transition
   temperature. These findings may be reasonably applied towards the
   prediction of healing processes in PLGA and in related biomaterials for
   important biomedical applications such as drug delivery. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Thermodynamics drive crystalline organic molecules to be crystallized at
   temperatures below their melting point. Even though molecules can form
   supercooled liquids by rapid cooling, crystalline organic materials
   readily undergo a phase transformation to an energetically favorable
   crystalline phase upon subsequent heat treatment. Opposite to this
   general observation, here, we report molecular design of thermally
   stable supercooled liquid of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives and
   their intriguing shear-triggered crystallization with dramatic optical
   property changes. Molten DPP8, one of the DPP derivatives, remains as
   stable supercooled liquid without crystallization through subsequent
   thermal cycles. More interestingly, under shear conditions, this
   supercooled liquid DPP8 transforms to its crystal phase accompanied by a
   25-fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency and a
   color change. By systematic investigation on supercooled liquid
   formation of crystalline DPP derivatives and their correlation with
   chemical structures, we reveal that the origin of this thermally stable
   supercooled liquid is a subtle force balance between aromatic
   interactions among the core units and van der Waals interactions among
   the aliphatic side chains acting in opposite directions. Moreover, by
   applying shear force to a supercooled liquid DPP8 film at different
   temperatures, we demonstrated direct writing of fluorescent patterns and
   propagating fluorescence amplification, respectively. Shear-triggered
   crystallization of DPP8 is further achieved even by living cell
   attachment and spreading, demonstrating the high sensitivity of the
   shear-triggered crystallization which is about 6 orders of magnitude
   more sensitive than typical mechanochromism observed in organic
   materials.}},

Title = {{Multiple MoS2 Transistors for Sensing Molecule Interaction Kinetics}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{Atomically layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) exhibit a
   significant potential to enable next-generation low-cost transistor
   biosensors that permit single-molecule-level quantification of
   biomolecules. To realize such potential biosensing capability,
   device-oriented research is needed for calibrating the sensor responses
   to enable the quantification of the affinities/kinetics of biomolecule
   interactions. In this work, we demonstrated MoS2-based transistor
   biosensors capable of detecting tumor necrosis factor - alpha
   (TNF-alpha) with a detection limit as low as 60 fM. Such a detection
   limit was achieved in both linear and subthreshold regimes of MoS2
   transistors. In both regimes, all sets of transistors exhibited
   consistent calibrated responses with respect to TNF-alpha concentration,
   and they resulted in a standard curve, from which the equilibrium
   constant of the antibody-(TNF-alpha) pair was extracted to be K-D = 369
   +/- 48 fM. Based on this calibrated sensor model, the time-dependent
   binding kinetics was also measured and the association/dissociation
   rates of the antibody-(TNF-alpha) pair were extracted to be (5.03 +/-
   0.16) x 10(8)M(-1)s(-1) and (1.97 +/- 0.08) x 10(-4)s(-1), respectively.
   This work advanced the critical device physics for leveraging the
   excellent electronic/structural properties of TMDCs in biosensing
   applications as well as the research capability in analyzing the
   biomolecule interactions with fM-level sensitivities.}},

   solar modules}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{MAY 25}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the scalability of multi-junction organic photovoltaic
   cells (OPV) with device areas ranging from 1 mm(2) to 1 cm(2), as well
   as 25 cm(2) active area solar modules. We find that the series
   resistance losses in 1 cm(2) vs. 1 mm(2) OPV cell efficiencies are
   significantly higher in single junction cells than tandem, triple, and
   four junction cells due to the lower operating voltage and higher
   current of the former. Using sub-electrodes to reduce series resistance,
   the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of multi-junction cells is almost
   independent of area from 1 mm(2) to 1 cm(2). Twenty-five, 1 cm(2)
   multi-junction cell arrays are integrated in a module and connected in a
   series-parallel circuit configuration. A yield of 100\% with a deviation
   of PCE from cell to cell of < 10\% is achieved. The module generates an
   output power of 16 +/- 69 mW under simulated AM1.5G illumination at one
   sun intensity, corresponding to PCE = 6.5 +/- 0.1\%, slightly lower than
   PCE of discrete cells ranging from 6.7\% to 7.2\%. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{An experimental study was carried out in order to analyze the formation

   Results showed that the in-flight particles melted and broke up through
   strong coupling with the supersonic plasma jet in thermal and momentum
   transfer, resulting in the deposited SAPS-particles being significantly
   smaller in size than either the original feedstock powders or the
   subsonic particles during the conventional atmospheric plasma spraying
   (APS). The fragmented particles travelling in a supersonic plasma jet
   had a lower Reynolds number and lower solidification time, leading to
   the formation of disk-shaped splats with lower thickness and surface
   roughness. This was crucial in reducing or eliminating the defects of
   as-sprayed coating and in forming the fine-lamellar structured
   SAPS-coating with a higher mechanical property. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{We present the design of a concentric tube (CT) reactor for roll-to-roll
   chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on flexible substrates, and its
   application to continuous production of graphene on copper foil. In the
   CTCVD reactor, the thin foil substrate is helically wrapped around the
   inner tube, and translates through the gap between the concentric tubes.
   We use a bench-scale prototype machine to synthesize graphene on copper
   substrates at translation speeds varying from 25 mm/min to 500 mm/min,
   and investigate the influence of process parameters on the uniformity
   and coverage of graphene on a continuously moving foil. At lower speeds,
   high-quality monolayer graphene is formed; at higher speeds, rapid
   nucleation of small graphene domains is observed, yet coalescence is
   prevented by the limited residence time in the CTCVD system. We show
   that a smooth isothermal transition between the reducing and
   carbon-containing atmospheres, enabled by injection of the carbon
   feedstock via radial holes in the inner tube, is essential to
   high-quality roll-to-roll graphene CVD. We discuss how the foil quality
   and microstructure limit the uniformity of graphene over macroscopic
   dimensions. We conclude by discussing means of scaling and reconfiguring
   the CTCVD design based on general requirements for 2-D materials
   manufacturing.}},

   layers. Agreement was observed between simulations and experiment,
   including complex phenomena occurring at the intersections between
   facets. The sources of the discrepancies between simulated and

Abstract = {{Models of space-charge affected thermal-field emission from protrusions,
   able to incorporate the effects of both surface roughness and elongated
   field emitter structures in beam optics codes, are desirable but
   difficult. The models proposed here treat the meso-scale diode region
   separate from the micro-scale regions characteristic of the emission
   sites. The consequences of discrete emission events are given for both
   one-dimensional (sheets of charge) and three dimensional (rings of
   charge) models: in the former, results converge to steady state
   conditions found by theory (e.g., Rokhlenko et al. {[}J. Appl. Phys.
   107, 014904 (2010)]) but show oscillatory structure as they do. Surface
   roughness or geometric features are handled using a ring of charge
   model, from which the image charges are found and used to modify the
   apex field and emitted current. The roughness model is shown to have
   additional constraints related to the discrete nature of electron
   charge. The ability of a unit cell model to treat field emitter
   structures and incorporate surface roughness effects inside a beam
   optics code is assessed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the evolution of dislocation densities during compressive
   deformation of nanoscale Cu/Nb single crystal multilayers with
   individual layer thickness of 20 nm is investigated using Synchrotron
   X-ray micro-diffraction. The samples were subjected to successive
   compression straining up to a final cumulative strain of 35\%. The
   nanolayer composite exhibited a maximum flow strength of similar to 1.6
   GPa at approximately 24\% compressive strain. Synchrotron X-ray
   micro-diffraction experiments, using a monochromatic beam of 10 keV
   energy were performed after each compression strain increment. We
   observed a significant increase in X-ray ring width peak broadening in
   both Cu and Nb layers up to strains of similar to 3.5\% followed by
   saturation broadening at higher strains. This observation indicates that
   the interfaces of the Cu/Nb nanolayers are very effective in trapping
   and annihilating dislocation content during mechanical deformation. (C)

   great attention in the past decade. Because the functional layers in
   OPVs can be dissolved in common solvents, they can be manufactured by
   eco-friendly and scalable printing or coating technologies. In this
   review article, the focus is on recent efforts to control
   nanomorphologies of photoactive layer and discussion of various
   solution-processed charge transport and extraction materials, to
   maximize the performance of OPV cells. Next, recent works on printing
   and coating technologies for OPVs to realize solution processing are
   reviewed. The review concludes with a discussion of recent advances in
   the development of non-traditional lamination and transfer method
   towards highly efficient and fully solution-processed OPV.}},

Title = {{Scaling for quantum tunneling current in nano- and subnano-scale
   plasmonic junctions}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 19}},
Abstract = {{When two conductors are separated by a sufficiently thin insulator,
   electrical current can flow between them by quantum tunneling. This
   paper presents a self-consistent model of tunneling current in a nano-
   and subnano-meter metal-insulator-metal plasmonic junction, by including
   the effects of space charge and exchange correlation potential. It is
   found that the J-V curve of the junction may be divided into three
   regimes: direct tunneling, field emission, and space-charge-limited
   regime. In general, the space charge inside the insulator reduces
   current transfer across the junction, whereas the exchange-correlation
   potential promotes current transfer. It is shown that these effects may
   modify the current density by orders of magnitude from the widely used
   Simmons' formula, which is only accurate for a limited parameter space
   (insulator thickness > 1 nm and barrier height > 3 eV) in the direct
   tunneling regime. The proposed self-consistent model may provide a more
   accurate evaluation of the tunneling current in the other regimes. The
   effects of anode emission and material properties (i.e. work function of
   the electrodes, electron affinity and permittivity of the insulator) are
   examined in detail in various regimes. Our simple model and the general
   scaling for tunneling current may provide insights to new regimes of
   quantum plasmonics.}},

Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Head injury is the leading cause of fatality and long-term disability
   for children. Pediatric heads change rapidly in both size and shape
   during growth, especially for children under 3 years old (YO). To
   accurately assess the head injury risks for children, it is necessary to
   understand the geometry of the pediatric head and how morphologic
   features influence injury causation within the 0-3 YO population. In
   this study, head CT scans from fifty-six 0-3 YO children were used to
   develop a statistical model of pediatric skull geometry. Geometric
   features important for injury prediction, including skull size and
   shape, skull thickness and suture width, along with their variations
   among the sample population, were quantified through a series of image
   and statistical analyses. The size and shape of the pediatric skull
   change significantly with age and head circumference. The skull
   thickness and suture width vary with age, head circumference and
   location, which will have important effects on skull stiffness and
   injury prediction. The statistical geometry model developed in this
   study can provide a geometrical basis for future development of child
   anthropomorphic test devices and pediatric head finite element models.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Tumor cell migration toward and intravasation into capillaries is an
   early and key event in cancer metastasis, yet not all cancer cells are
   imbued with the same capability to do so. This heterogeneity within a
   tumor is a fundamental property of cancer. Tools to help us understand
   what molecular characteristics allow a certain subpopulation of cells to
   spread from the primary tumor are thus critical for overcoming
   metastasis. Conventional in vitro migration platforms treat populations
   in aggregate, which leads to a masking of intrinsic differences among
   cells. Some migration assays reported recently have single-cell
   resolution, but these platforms do not provide for selective retrieval
   of the distinct migrating and non-migrating cell populations for further
   analysis. Thus, to study the intrinsic differences in cells responsible
   for chemotactic heterogeneity, we developed a single-cell migration
   platform so that individual cells' migration behavior can be studied and
   the heterogeneous population sorted based upon chemotactic phenotype.
   Furthermore, after migration, the highly chemotactic and non-chemotactic
   cells were retrieved and proved viable for later molecular analysis of
   their differences. Moreover, we modified the migration channel to
   resemble lymphatic capillaries to better understand how certain cancer
   cells are able to move through geometrically confining spaces.}},

Abstract = {{We present a physical model for recently demonstrated high indium
   content self-assembled In0.4Ga0.6N/GaN quantum dot (QD)-based
   ridge-waveguide lasers emitting at red wavelengths. The strain
   distribution in the QD is calculated using linear elastic theory with
   the application of shrink-fit boundary condition at the InGaN/GaN
   material interface, and the electronic states are evaluated using a
   single-band effective mass Hamiltonian. A Schrodinger-Poisson
   self-consistent solver is used to describe the effect of charge
   screening under current injection. Our theoretical result shows a good
   match to the measured Hakki-Paoli gain spectrum. Combining the
   calculated gain spectrum and cavity properties, we have developed a
   device-level simulation to successfully explain the electrical and
   optical characteristics of this specific laser. Possible solutions to
   improving the device performance have been explored. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{Since the late 1990s, the Laurentian Great Lakes have experienced
   persistent low water levels and above average over-lake evaporation
   rates. During the winter of 2013-2014, the lakes endured the most
   persistent, lowest temperatures and highest ice cover in recent history,
   fostering speculation that over-lake evaporation rates might decrease
   and that water levels might rise. To address this speculation, we
   examined interseasonal relationships in Lake Michigan's thermal regime.
   We find pronounced relationships between winter conditions and
   subsequent fall heat content, modest relationships with fall surface
   temperature, but essentially no correlation with fall evaporation rates.
   Our findings suggest that the extreme winter conditions of 2013-2014 may
   have induced a shift in Lake Michigan's thermal regime and that this
   shift coincides with a recent (and ongoing) rise in Great Lakes water
   levels. If the shift persists, it could (assuming precipitation rates
   remain relatively constant) represent a return to thermal and hydrologic
   conditions not observed on Lake Michigan in over 15years.}},

Abstract = {{While coarsening of spherical particles has been well documented, our
   understanding of coarsening of complex microstructures is still limited.
   The first step in developing a theory of coarsening of microstructures
   with complex morphologies is to study coarsening of microstructures that
   evolve self-similarly. In this paper, we examine the morphological
   evolution of a self-similar two-phase bicontinuous structure generated
   via nonconserved dynamics (i.e., motion by mean curvature) to elucidate
   the complex dynamics of coarsening. We find that the evolution proceeds
   with some interfaces evolving toward topological singularities
   (pinching) while the majority of interfaces flatten. These two processes
   were also illustrated through the evolution equation for the mean
   curvature, which has a term that depends solely on the local curvatures,
   as well as a term that is proportional to the surface Laplacian of the
   mean curvature. The first term causes an increase in the magnitude of
   the mean curvature, while the second term causes smoothing of the mean
   curvature in a manner similar to diffusion of chemical species on a
   surface. The second term causes a large dispersion in the values of the
   time derivative of mean curvature at various locations in the structure,
   characterized neither by the mean curvature nor the Gaussian curvature.

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Wireless charging, as opposed to plug-in charging, is an alternative
   charging method for electric vehicles (EVs) with rechargeable batteries
   and can be applicable to EVs with fixed routes, such as transit buses.
   This study adds to the current research of EV wireless charging by
   utilizing the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to provide a comprehensive
   framework for comparing the life cycle energy demand and greenhouse gas
   emissions associated with a stationary wireless charging all-electric
   bus system to a plug-in charging all-electric bus system. Life cycle
   inventory analysis of both plug-in and wireless charging hardware was
   conducted, and battery downsizing, vehicle lightweighting and use-phase
   energy consumption were modeled, A bus system in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti
   area in Michigan is used as the basis for bus system modeling. Results
   show that the wirelessly charged battery can be downsized to 27-44\% of
   a plug-in charged battery. The associated reduction of 12-16\% in bus
   weight for the wireless buses can induce a reduction of 5.4-7.0\% in
   battery-to-wheel energy consumption. In the base case, the wireless
   charging system consumes 0.3\% less energy and emits 0.5\% less
   greenhouse gases than the plug-in charging system in the total life
   cycle. To further improve the energy and environmental performance of a
   wireless charging electric bus system, it is important to focus on key
   parameters including carbon intensity of the electric grid and wireless
   charging efficiency, If the wireless charging efficiency is improved to
   the same level as the assumed plug-in charging efficiency (90\%), the
   difference of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions between the two
   systems can increase to 6.3\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{289}},
Pages = {{196-223}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{In this article, a rigorous framework for the analysis of the
   convergence of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is
   presented. It is applied to the simulation of two test cases: an
   axisymmetric jet at a Knudsen number of 0.01 and Mach number of 1 and a
   two-dimensional cylinder flow at a Knudsen of 0.05 and Mach 10. The rate
   of convergence of sampled quantities is found to be well predicted by an
   extended form of the Central Limit Theorem that takes into account the
   correlation of samples but requires the calculation of correlation

Abstract = {{With its particular ability to image solute clusters in three dimensions
   and impurity segregation to selected interfaces and grain boundaries,
   atom probe tomography has provided unique insight into the effects of
   irradiation on materials microstructures. This article reviews the
   contribution of atom probe tomography to our understanding of behaviors
   and responses of structural materials under irradiation. Possible atom
   probe tomography based approaches and common data analysis methods to
   analyze the microstructural features often observed in irradiated
   materials are described. In particular, the analysis of solute
   clustering, solute segregation, and void imaging are discussed in the
   context of radiation-induced hardening of austenitic steels and reactor
   pressure vessel steels, and the development of oxide dispersion
   strengthened steels, radiation-induced solute segregation to grain
   boundaries for stress corrosion cracking or corrosion issues, and to
   understand the swelling response of irradiated materials. While
   highlighting the unique information that atom probe tomography can
   offer, common limitations, current challenges, and outstanding technical
   questions regarding data analysis and interpretation are also presented.}},

   accelerated through a carefully chosen combination of advanced
   multiscale modeling paired with appropriate experimental validation. The
   studies reported in this work, the combined efforts of six universities

   use that approach to focus on improving the scientific basis for the
   response of ferritic-martensitic steels to irradiation. A combination of
   modern modeling techniques with controlled experimentation has
   specifically focused on improving the understanding of radiation-induced
   segregation, precipitate formation and growth under radiation, the
   stability of oxide nanoclusters, and the development of dislocation
   networks under radiation. Experimental studies use both model and
   commercial alloys, irradiated with both ion beams and neutrons.
   Transmission electron microscopy and atom probe are combined with both
   first-principles and rate theory approaches to advance the understanding

   zirconia with a preferential orientation of the oxide grains. Second
   phase particles (SPPs) consumed by the oxidation front were rapidly
   oxidized, but no SPPs were amorphized or dissolved in the metal matrix

Abstract = {{The progressive build up of fission products inside different nuclear
   reactor components can lead to significant damage of the constituent
   materials. We demonstrate the use of time-domain thermoreflectance
   (TDTR), a nondestructive thermal measurement technique, to study the
   effects of radiation damage on material properties. We use TDTR to
   report on the thermal conductivity of optimized ZIRLO, a material used
   as fuel cladding in nuclear reactors. We find that the thermal
   conductivity of optimized ZIRLO is 10.7 +/- 1.8 W m(-1) K-1 at room
   temperature. Furthermore, we find that the thermal conductivities of
   copper-niobium nanostructured multilayers do not change with helium ion
   irradiation doses of 10(15) cm(-2) and ion energy of 200 keV,
   demonstrating the potential of heterogeneous multilayer materials for
   radiation tolerant coatings. Finally, we compare the effect of ion doses
   and ion beam energies on the measured thermal conductivity of bulk
   silicon. Our results demonstrate that TDTR can be used to quantify depth
   dependent damage.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{One of the obstacles preventing wireless power transfer from becoming
   ubiquitous is their leakage of power: high-amplitude electromagnetic
   fields that can interfere with other electronic devices, increase health
   concerns, or hinder power metering. In this paper, we present near-field
   plates (NFPs) as a novel method to tailor the electromagnetic fields
   generated by a wireless power transfer system while maintaining high
   efficiency. NFPs are modulated arrays or surfaces designed to form
   prescribed near-field patterns. The NFP proposed in this paper consists
   of an array of loaded loops that are designed to confine the
   electromagnetic fields of a resonant transmitting loop to the desired
   direction (receiving loop) while suppressing fields in other directions.
   The step-by-step design procedure for this device is outlined. Two NFPs
   are designed and examined in full-wave simulation. Their performance is
   shown to be in close agreement with the design predictions, thereby
   verifying the proposed design and operation. A NFP is also fabricated
   and experimentally shown to form a unidirectional wireless power
   transfer link with high efficiency. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We present a structural phase-field crystal model {[}M. Greenwood et
   al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 045702 (2010)] that yields a stable dc
   structure. The stabilization of a dc structure is accomplished by
   constructing a two-body direct correlation function (DCF) approximated
   by a combination of two Gaussian functions in Fourier space. A phase
   diagram containing a dc-liquid phase coexistence region is calculated
   for this model. We examine the energies of solid-liquid interfaces with
   normals along the {[}100], {[}110], and {[}111] directions. The
   dependence of the interfacial energy on a temperature parameter, which
   controls the heights of the peaks in the two-body DCF, is described by a
   Gaussian function. Furthermore, the dependence of the interfacial energy
   on the peak widths of the two-body DCF, which controls the excess energy
   associated with interfaces, defects, and strain, is described by an
   inverse power law. These relationships can be used to parametrize the
   phase-field crystal model for the dc structure to match solid-liquid
   interfacial energies to those measured experimentally or calculated from
   atomistic simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The need for smart materials in the area of biotechnology has fueled the
   development of numerous stimuli-responsive polymers. Many of these
   polymers are responsive to pH, light, temperature, or oxidative stress,
   and yet very few are responsive toward multiple stimuli. Here we report
   on the synthesis of a novel dual-stimuli-responsive poly(ethylene
   glycol)-based polymer capable of changing its hydrophilic properties
   upon treatment with UV light (exogenous stimulus) and markers of
   oxidative stress (endogenous stimulus). From this polymer, smart
   microparticles and fibers were fabricated and their responses to either
   stimulus separately and in conjunction were examined. Comparison of the
   degradation kinetics demonstrated that the polymer became water-soluble
   only after both oxidation and irradiation with UV light, which resulted
   in selective degradation of the corresponding particles. Furthermore, in
   vitro experiments demonstrated successful uptake of these particles by
   Raw 264.7 cells. Such dual-stimuli-responsive particles could have
   potential applications in drug delivery, imaging, and tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{We use chemical vapor deposition polymerization to prepare a novel
   dibromomaleimide-functionalized polymer for selective and reversible
   binding of thiol-containing biomolecules on a broad range of Substrates.
   We report the synthesis and CVD polymerization of
   4-(3,4-dibromomaleimide){[}2.2]paracyclophane to yield nanometer thick
   polymer coatings. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the chemical composition of the
   polymer coating. The reactivity of the polymer coating toward
   thiol-functionalized molecules was confirmed using fluorescent ligands.
   As a proof of concept, the binding and subsequent release of
   cysteine-modified peptides from the polymer coating were also
   demonstrated via sum frequency generation spectroscopy. This reactive
   polymer coating provides a flexible surface modification approach to
   selectively and reversibly bind biomolecules on a broad range of
   materials, which Could open up new opportunities in many biomedical
   sensing and diagnostic applications where specific binding and release
   of target analytes are desired.}},

Journal = {{DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Products of multiexon genes, especially in higher organisms, are a
   mixture of isoforms with different or even opposing functions, and
   therefore need to be treated separately. However, most studies and
   available resources such as Gene Ontology provide only gene-level
   function annotations, and therefore lose the differential information at
   the isoform level. Here we report MIsoMine, a high-resolution portal to
   multiple levels of functional information of alternatively spliced
   isoforms in the mouse. This data portal provides tissue-specific
   expression patterns and co-expression networks, along with such
   previously published functional genomic data as protein domains,
   predicted isoform-level functions and functional relationships. The core
   utility of MIsoMine is allowing users to explore a preprocessed,
   quality-controlled set of RNA-seq data encompassing diverse tissues and
   cell lineages. Tissue-specific co-expression networks were established,
   allowing a 2D ranking of isoforms and tissues by co-expression patterns.
   The results of the multiple isoforms of the same gene are presented in
   parallel to facilitate direct comparison, with cross-talking to
   prioritized functions at the isoform level. MIsoMine provides the first
   isoform-level resolution effort at genome-scale. We envision that this
   data portal will be a valuable resource for exploring functional genomic
   data, and will complement the existing functionalities of the mouse
   genome informatics database and the gene expression database for the
   laboratory mouse.}},

Abstract = {{Putative riboflavin receptors are considered as biomarkers due to their
   overexpression in breast and prostate cancers. Hence, these receptors
   can be potentially exploited for use in targeted drug delivery systems
   where dendrimer nanoparticles with multivalent ligand attachments can
   lead to greater specificity in cellular interactions. In this study, the
   single molecule force spectroscopy technique was used to assess the
   physical strength of multivalent interactions by employing a riboflavin
   (RF)-conjugated generation 5 PAMAM dendrimer G5(RF)(n) nanoparticle. By
   varying the average RF ligand valency (n = 0, 3, 5), the rupture force
   was measured between G5(RF)(n) and the riboflavin binding protein
   (RFBP). The rupture force increased when the valency of RF increased. We
   observed at the higher valency (n = 5) three binding events that
   increased in rupture force with increasing loading rate. Assuming a
   single energy barrier, the Bell-Evans model was used to determine the
   kinetic off-rate and barrier width for all binding interactions. The
   analysis of our results appears to indicate that multivalent
   interactions are resulting in changes to rupture force and kinetic
   off-rates.}},

Title = {{Deep convolutional neural networks for annotating gene expression
   patterns in the mouse brain}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Profiling gene expression in brain structures at various
   spatial and temporal scales is essential to understanding how genes
   regulate the development of brain structures. The Allen Developing Mouse
   Brain Atlas provides high-resolution 3-D in situ hybridization (ISH)
   gene expression patterns in multiple developing stages of the mouse
   brain. Currently, the ISH images are annotated with anatomical terms
   manually. In this paper, we propose a computational approach to annotate
   gene expression pattern images in the mouse brain at various structural
   levels over the course of development.
   Results: We applied deep convolutional neural network that was trained
   on a large set of natural images to extract features from the ISH images
   of developing mouse brain. As a baseline representation, we applied
   invariant image feature descriptors to capture local statistics from ISH
   images and used the bag-of-words approach to build image-level
   representations. Both types of features from multiple ISH image sections
   of the entire brain were then combined to build 3-D, brain-wide gene
   expression representations. We employed regularized learning methods for
   discriminating gene expression patterns in different brain structures.
   Results show that our approach of using convolutional model as feature
   extractors achieved superior performance in annotating gene expression
   patterns at multiple levels of brain structures throughout four
   developing ages. Overall, we achieved average AUC of 0.894 +/- 0.014, as
   compared with 0.820 +/- 0.046 yielded by the bag-of-words approach.
   Conclusions: Deep convolutional neural network model trained on natural
   image sets and applied to gene expression pattern annotation tasks
   yielded superior performance, demonstrating its transfer learning
   property is applicable to such biological image sets.}},

Abstract = {{Using confocal microscopy and first passage time analysis, we measure
   and predict the rates of formation and breakage of
   polymer-depletion-induced bonds between lock-and-key colloidal particles
   and find that an indirect route to bond formation is accessed at a rate
   comparable to that of the direct formation of these bonds. In the
   indirect route, the pocket of the lock particle is accessed by
   nonspecific bonding of the key particle with the lock surface, followed
   by surface diffusion leading to specific binding in the pocket of the
   lock. The surprisingly high rate of indirect binding is facilitated by
   its high entropy relative to that of the pocket. Rate constants for
   forward and reverse transitions among free, nonspecific, and specific
   bonds are reported, compared to theoretical values, and used to
   determine the free energy difference between the nonspecific and
   specific binding states. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   a thin SnO2 layer and a dense Fe2O3 nanocrystals (NCs) shell, and their
   application for significantly enhanced solar water reduction in a
   neutral medium is reported. The p-Si/n-SnO2 /n-Fe2O3 css-NW structure is
   characterized in detail using scanning, transmission, and scanning
   transmission electron microscopes. The p-Si/n-SnO2 /n-Fe2O3 css-NWs show
   considerably improved photocathodic performances, including higher
   photocurrent and lower photocathodic turn-on potential, compared to the
   bare p-Si NWs or p-Si/n-SnO2 core/shell NWs (cs-NWs), due to increased
   optical absorption, enhanced charge separation, and improved gas
   evolution. As a result, photoactivity at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen
   electrode and a low onset potential in the neutral solution are
   achieved. Moreover, p-Si/n-SnO2 /n-Fe2O3 css-NWs exhibit long-term
   photoelectrochemical stability due to the Fe2O3 NCs shell well
   protection. These results reveal promising css-NW photoelectrodes from
   cost-effective materials by facile fabrication with simultaneously
   improved photocathodic performance and stability.}},

Abstract = {{In the United States, state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)
   have served as key drivers for the development of new renewable energy.
   This research presents a method to evaluate emissions reductions and
   costs attributable to new or expanded RPS programs by integrating a
   comprehensive economic dispatch model and a renewable project selection
   model. The latter model minimizes incremental RPS costs, accounting for
   renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs, displaced generation and
   capacity costs, and net changes to a state's imports and exports. We
   test this method on potential expansions to Michigan RPS, evaluating
   target renewable penetrations of 10\% (business as usual or BAU), 20\%,
   25\%, and 40\%, with varying times to completion. Relative to the BAU
   case, these expanded RPS policies reduce the CO2 intensity of generation
   by 13\%, 18\%, and 33\% by 2035, respectively. SO2 emissions intensity
   decreased by 13\%, 20\%, and 34\% for each of the three scenarios, while
   NOx reductions totaled 12\%, 17\%, and 31\%, relative to the BAU case.
   For CO2 and NOx, absolute reductions in emissions intensity were not as
   large due to an increasing trend in emissions intensity in the BAU case
   driven by load growth. Over the study period (2015 to 2035), the
   absolute CO2 emissions intensity increased by 1\% in the 20\% RPS case
   and decreased by 6\% and 22\% for the 25\% and 40\% cases, respectively.
   Between 26\% and 31\% of the CO2, SO2, and NOx, emissions reductions
   attributable to the expanded RPS occur in neighboring states,
   underscoring the challenges quantifying local emissions reductions from
   state-level energy policies with an interconnected grid. Without federal
   subsidies, the cost of CO2 mitigation using an RPS in Michigan is
   between \$28 and \$34/t CO2 when RPS targets are met. The optimal
   renewable build plan is sensitive to the capacity credit for solar but
   insensitive to the value for wind power.}},

Title = {{Kinetic Stability of MOF-5 in Humid Environments: Impact of Powder
   Densification, Humidity Level, and Exposure Time}},
Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of microporous,
   crystalline materials with potential applications in the capture,
   storage, and separation of gases. Of the many known MOFs, MOP-5 has
   attracted considerable attention because of its ability to store gaseous
   fuels at low pressure with high densities. Nevertheless, MOF-5 and
   several other MOFs exhibit limited stability upon exposure to reactive
   species such as water. The present study quantifies the impact of humid
   air exposure on the properties of MOF-5 as a function of exposure time,
   humidity level, and morphology (i.e., powders vs pellets). Properties
   examined include hydrogen storage capacity, surface area, and
   crystallinity. Water adsorption/desorption isotherms are measured using
   a gravimetric technique; the first uptake exhibits a type V isotherm
   with a sudden increase in uptake at similar to 50\% relative humidity.
   For humidity levels below this threshold only minor degradation is
   observed for exposure times up to several hours, suggesting that MOP-5
   is more stable than generally assumed under moderately humid conditions.
   In contrast, irreversible degradation occurs in a matter of minutes for
   exposures above the 50\% threshold. Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy indicates that molecular and/or dissociated water is
   inserted into the skeletal framework after long exposure times.
   Densification into pellets can slow the degradation of MOP-5
   significantly, and may present a pathway to enhance the stability of
   some MOFs.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate electrochemical properties of Mg in layered and spinel

   at stoichiometric compositions due to Mg-vacancy ordering. Mg ions are
   predicted to occupy the octahedral sites in both layered and spinel TiS2
   with diffusion mediated by hops between octahedral sites that pass
   through adjacent tetrahedral sites. Predicted migration barriers are
   substantially higher than typical Li-migration barriers in intercalation
   compounds. The migration barriers are shown to be very sensitive to
   lattice parameters of the host crystal structure. We also discuss the

Abstract = {{This article presents a multi-objective design optimization study of a
   vehicle suspension system with passive variable stiffness and active
   damping. Design of suspension systems is particularly challenging when
   the effective mass of the vehicle is subject to considerable variation
   during service. Perfectly maintaining the suspension performance under
   the variable load typically requires a controlled actuator to emulate
   variable stiffness. This is typically done through a hydraulic or
   pneumatic system, which can be too costly for small/medium pick-up
   trucks. The system in this article employs two springs with an offset to
   the second spring so that it engages during large deformation only,
   thereby providing passive variable stiffness without expensive
   hydraulics. The system damping is assumed to be controlled via variable
   viscosity magnetizable fluid, which can be implemented in a compact,
   low-power set-up. Performance indices from the literature are evaluated
   at minimum and maximum weight, and regarded as objectives in a
   multi-objective problem. As the individual objectives are prone to
   having local optima, the multi-objective problem is prone to having a
   disjointed Pareto-space. To deal with this issue, a modification is
   proposed to a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The algorithm
   performance is investigated via analytical test functions as well as the
   design case of the suspension system.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},

Pages = {{1063-1101}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Lasso is a widely used regression technique to find sparse
   representations. When the dimension of the feature space and the number
   of samples are extremely large, solving the Lasso problem remains
   challenging. To improve the efficiency of solving large-scale Lasso
   problems, El Ghaoui and his colleagues have proposed the SAFE rules
   which are able to quickly identify the inactive predictors, i.e.,
   predictors that have 0 components in the solution vector. Then, the
   inactive predictors or features can be removed from the optimization
   problem to reduce its scale. By transforming the standard Lasso to its
   dual form, it can be shown that the inactive predictors include the set
   of inactive constraints on the optimal dual solution. In this paper, we
   propose an efficient and effective screening rule via Dual Polytope
   Projections (DPP), which is mainly based on the uniqueness and
   nonexpansiveness of the optimal dual solution due to the fact that the
   feasible set in the dual space is a convex and closed polytope.
   Moreover, we show that our screening rule can be extended to identify
   inactive groups in group Lasso. To the best of our knowledge, there is
   currently no exact screening rule for group Lasso. We have evaluated our
   screening rule using synthetic and real data sets. Results show that our
   rule is more effective in identifying inactive predictors than existing
   state-of-the-art screening rules for Lasso.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, population genetics has gained tremendous success in
   identifying genetic variations that are statistically relevant to renal
   diseases and kidney function. However, it is challenging to interpret
   the functional relevance of the genetic variations found by population
   genetics studies. In this review, we discuss studies that integrate
   multiple levels of data, especially transcriptome profiles and phenotype
   data, to assign functional roles of genetic variations involved in
   kidney function. Furthermore, we introduce state-of-the-art machine
   learning algorithms, Bayesian networks, support vector machines, and
   Gaussian process regression, which have been applied successfully to
   integrating genetic, regulatory, and clinical information to predict
   clinical outcomes. These methods are likely to be deployed successfully
   in the nephrology field in the near future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Objectives: Glycemic control can lower the risk of diabetes-related
   complications, and delayed treatment intensification can impede optimal
   diabetes care. This study examines trends in hyperglycemia treatment
   intensification between 2002 and 2010.
   Study Design: Retrospective secondary data analysis of a large national
   administrative data set of privately insured individuals across the
   United States.
   Methods: Adults 18 years or older with diabetes, initiated on metformin
   monotherapy between 2002 and 2007, were studied, stratified by date of
   first metformin prescription (2002-2003, 2004-2005, 2006-2007). Time to
   treatment intensification between 2002 and 2010, defined by the addition
   of >= 1 agents to metformin, was estimated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox
   proportional hazards regression analysis.
   Results: There were 75,069 treatment-naive adults with diabetes first
   initiated on metformin between 2002 and 2007; mean age was 60 years (SD
   = 11.5), 49.7\% were women, and 63.1\% were non-Hispanic white. Diabetes
   therapy was intensified in 26,169 individuals (34.6\%). Treatment
   intensification became increasingly more likely with time for the
   2004-2005 cohort (hazard ratio {[}HR], 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.10) and for
   the 2006-2007 cohort (HR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.14) compared with the
   2002-2003 cohort (P <. 001), after adjustment for significant
   confounders including sex, income level, education level, and
   comorbidity burden. Sulfonylureas were the most commonly used agents,
   though their use declined over time; thiazolidinedione use decreased;
   and incretin use increased (all P <. 001).
   Conclusions: There was a significant increase in diabetes treatment
   intensification between 2002 and 2010. Choice of second-line agents
   changed as well, with decreasing prevalence of thiazolidinedione and
   sulfonylurea use and rising prevalence of incretin use.}},

Title = {{The effect of impurities on syngas combustion}},
Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2286-2295}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The effects of chemical impurities on the combustion of syngas were
   investigated, focusing on CH4, a common component of syngas, and
   trimethylsilanol (TMS), an unstudied impurity related to those common to
   landfill-based syngas. Ignition properties were systematically
   investigated at high-pressure low-temperature conditions relevant to gas
   turbine combustor operation using the University of Michigan Rapid
   Compression Facility. Pressure time history measurements and high-speed
   imaging of the ignition process in this facility were used to determine
   auto-ignition delay times and observe ignition behaviors. The four
   simulated syngas mixtures used were (1) pure syngas: 30\% H-2, 70\% CO
   fuel volume. (2) syngas with CH4: 27\% H-2, 67\% CO, 6\% CH4, (3 \& 4)
   pure syngas with 10 or 100 ppm TMS, all with fuel-to-O-2 equivalence
   ratios (phi) 01 0.1 at air dilution (i.e. molar O-2 to inert gas ratio
   of 1:3.76). and N-2 as the primary diluent gas. The pressures after
   compression were 5 \& 15 atm with temperatures of similar to 1010-1110 K
   respectively. The results uniquely illustrated the occurrence of
   two-step ignition behavior at higher pressures, with two distinct
   regions of heat release and pressure rise. First and second
   auto-ignition delay times were therefore defined and interestingly the
   times were affected differently by the addition of impurities. The
   addition of CH4 consistently increased auto-ignition delay times up to
   40\% at 15 atm, while increasing delay times at 5 atm by up to a factor
   of three. Conversely, the addition of 10 ppm TMS impurity addition
   caused a consistent decrease of similar to 10-30\% delay times at 15 atm
   with insignificant impact at 5 atm, and 100 ppm TMS impurity caused
   consistent decreases of 50-70\% at 15 atm and 20-30\% decreases at 5
   atm. The marked pressure dependence of the auto-ignition delay time,
   typical for syngas at these conditions, was virtually eliminated for the
   100 ppm TMS mixture. Kinetic modeling suggests that the promoting
   effects of TMS are related to enhanced consumption and/or reduced
   production of HO2. The impact of TMS is remarkably similar to that for
   SiH4 in pure H-2, suggesting a possible trend for poorly understood
   Si-based species to promote auto-ignition in syngas and hydrogen
   mixtures. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{An expression that separates biotic and abiotic controls on the temporal
   dynamics of the soil moisture spatial coefficient of variation
   C-v(theta) was explored via numerical simulations using a mechanistic
   ecohydrological model, Tethys-Chloris. Continuous soil moisture
   spatiotemporal dynamics at an exemplary hillslope domain were computed
   for six case studies characterized by different climate and vegetation
   cover and for three configurations of soil properties. It was shown that
   abiotic controls largely exceed their biotic counterparts in wet
   climates. Biotic controls on C-v(theta) were found to be more pronounced
   in Mediterranean climates. The relation between C-v(theta) and spatial
   mean soil moisture (theta) over bar was found to be unique in wet
   locations, regardless of the soil properties. For the case of
   homogeneous soil texture, hysteretic cycles between C-v(theta) and
   (theta) over bar were observed in all Mediterranean climate locations
   considered here and to a lesser extent in a deciduous temperate forest.
   Heterogeneity in soil properties increased C-v(theta) to values
   commensurate with field observations and weakened signatures of
   hysteresis at all of the studied locations. This finding highlights the
   role of site-specific heterogeneities in hiding or even eliminating the
   signature of climatic and biotic controls on C-v(theta), thereby
   offering a new perspective on causes of confounding results reported
   across field experiments.}},

Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric pressure plasma jets have many beneficial effects in their
   use in surface treatment and, in particular, plasma medicine. One of
   these benefits is the controlled production of reactive oxygen and
   nitrogen species (RONS) in the active discharge through the molecular
   gases added to the primary noble gas in the input mixture, and through
   the interaction of reactive species in the plasma effluent with the
   ambient air. In this computational investigation, a parametric study was
   performed on the production of RONS in a multiply pulsed atmospheric
   pressure plasma jet sustained in a He/O-2 mixture and flowing into
   ambient humid air. The consequences of flow rate, O-2 fraction, voltage,
   and repetition rate on reactant densities after a single discharge
   pulse, after 30 pulses, and after the same total elapsed time were
   investigated. At the end of the first discharge pulse, voltage has the
   greatest influence on RONS production. However, the systematic trends
   for production of RONS depend on repetition rate and flow rate in large
   part due to the residence time of RONS in the plasma zone. Short
   residence times result in reactive species produced by the previous
   pulse still being in the discharge tube or in the path of the ionization
   wave at the next pulse. The RONS therefore accumulate in the tube and in
   the near effluent on a pulse-to-pulse basis. This accumulation enables
   species requiring multiple reactions among the primary RONS species to
   be produced in greater numbers.}},

   of electronegativity of the surrounding gas}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Atmospheric pressure plasma jets for biomedical applications are often
   sustained in He with small amounts of, for example, O-2 impurities and
   typically propagate into ambient air. The resulting poorly controlled
   generation of reactive species has motivated the use of gas shields to
   control the interaction of the plasma plume with the ambient gas. The
   use of different gases in the shield yields different behavior in the
   plasma plume. In this paper, we discuss results from experimental and
   computational investigations of He plasma jets having attaching and
   non-attaching gas shields. We found that negative ion formation in the
   He-air mixing region significantly affects the ionization wave dynamics
   and promotes the propagation of negative guided streamers through an
   electrostatic focusing mechanism. Results from standard and phase
   resolved optical emission spectroscopy ratios of emission from states of
   N-2 and He imply different electric fields in the plasma plume depending
   on the composition of the shielding gas. These effects are attributed to
   the conductivity in the transition region between the plasma plume and
   the shield gas, and the immobile charge represented by negative ions.
   The lower conductivity in the attaching mixtures enables more extended
   penetration of the electric field whereas the negative ions aid in
   focusing the electrons towards the axis.}},

Title = {{Controlling VUV photon fluxes in low-pressure inductively coupled
   plasmas}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Low-pressure (a few to hundreds of millitorrs) inductively coupled
   plasmas (ICPs), as typically used in microelectronics fabrication, often
   produce vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) photon fluxes onto surfaces comparable
   to or exceeding the magnitude of ion fluxes. These VUV photon fluxes are
   desirable in applications such as sterilization of medical equipment but
   are unwanted in many materials fabrication processes due to damage to
   the devices by the high-energy photons. Under specific conditions, VUV
   fluxes may stimulate etching or synergistically combine with ion fluxes
   to modify polymeric materials. In this regard, it is desirable to
   control the magnitude of VUV fluxes or the ratio of VUV fluxes to those
   of other reactive species, such as ions, or to discretely control the
   VUV spectrum. In this paper, we discuss results from a computational
   investigation of VUV fluxes from low-pressure ICPs sustained in rare gas
   mixtures. The control of VUV fluxes through the use of pressure, pulsed
   power, and gas mixture is discussed. We found that the ratio, beta, of
   VUV photon to ion fluxes onto surfaces generally increases with
   increasing pressure. When using pulsed plasmas, the instantaneous value
   of beta can vary by a factor of 4 or more during the pulse cycle due to
   the VUV flux more closely following the pulsed power.}},

Title = {{Performance assessment of lower VHF band for short-range communication
   and geolocation applications}},
Journal = {{RADIO SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{443-452}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is to characterize near-ground wave propagation
   in the lower very high frequency (VHF) band and to assess advantages
   that this frequency band offers for reliable short-range low-data rate
   communications and geolocation applications in highly cluttered
   environments as compared to conventional systems in the microwave range.
   With the advent of palm-sized miniaturized VHF antennas, interest in
   low-power and low-frequency communication links is increasing because
   (1) channel complexity is far less in this frequency band compared to
   higher frequencies and (2) significant signal penetration through/over
   obstacles is possible at this frequency. In this paper, we quantify the
   excess path loss and small-scale fading at the lower VHF and the 2.4GHz
   bands based on short-range measurements in various environments. We
   consider indoor-to-indoor, outdoor-to-indoor, and non-line-of-sight
   outdoor measurements and compare the results with measurements at higher
   frequencies which are used in conventional systems (i.e., 2.4GHz).
   Propagation measurements at the lower VHF band are carried out by using
   an electrically small antenna to assess the possibility of achieving a
   miniaturized, mobile system for near-ground communication. For each
   measurement scenario considered, path loss and small-scale fading are
   characterized after calibrating the differences in the systems used for
   measurements at different frequencies, including variations in antenna
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{We develop the first approximation algorithms with worst-case
   performance guarantees for periodic-review perishable inventory systems
   with general product lifetime, for both backlogging and lost-sales
   models. The demand process can be nonstationary and correlated over
   time, capturing such features as demand seasonality and forecast
   updates. The optimal control policy for such systems is notoriously
   complicated, thus finding effective heuristic policies is of practical
   importance. In this paper, we construct a computationally efficient
   inventory control policy, called the proportional-balancing policy, for
   systems with an arbitrarily correlated demand process and show that it
   has a worst-case performance guarantee less than 3. In addition, when
   the demands are independent and stochastically nondecreasing over time,
   we propose another policy, called the dual-balancing policy, which
   admits a worst-case performance guarantee of 2. We demonstrate through
   an extensive numerical study that both policies perform consistently
   close to optimal.}},

Abstract = {{High order harmonic generation from solid targets is a compelling route
   to generating intense attosecond or even zeptosecond pulses. However,
   the effects of ion motion on the generation of harmonics have only
   recently started to be considered. Here, we study the effects of ion
   motion in harmonics production at ultrahigh laser intensities
   interacting with solid density plasma. Using particle-in-cell
   simulations, we find that there is an optimum density for harmonic
   production that depends on laser intensity, which scales linearly with
   a(0) with no ion motion but with a reduced scaling if ion motion is
   included. We derive a scaling for this optimum density with ion motion
   and also find that the background ion motion induces Doppler red-shifts
   in the harmonic structures of the reflected pulse. The temporal
   structure of the Doppler shifts is correlated to the envelope of the
   incident laser pulse. We demonstrate that by introducing a frequency
   chirp in the incident pulse we are able to eliminate these Doppler
   shifts almost completely. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Deficiencies of cathode materials severely limit cycling performance and
   discharge rates of Li batteries. The key problem is that cathode
   materials must combine multiple properties: high lithium ion
   intercalation capacity, electrical/ionic conductivity, porosity, and
   mechanical toughness. Some materials revealed promising characteristics
   in a subset of these properties, but attaining the entire set of often
   contrarian characteristics requires new methods of materials
   engineering. In this paper, we report high surface area 3D composite
   from reduced graphene oxide loaded with LiFePO4 (LFP) nanoparticles made
   by layer-by-layer assembly (LBL). High electrical conductivity of the
   LBL composite is combined with high ionic conductivity, toughness, and
   low impedance. As a result of such materials properties, reversible
   lithium storage capacity and Coulombic efficiency were as high as 148 mA
   h g(-1) and 99\%, respectively, after 100 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, these
   composites enabled unusually high reversible charge-discharge rates up
   to 160 C with a storage capacity of 56 mA h g(-1), exceeding those of
   known LFP-based cathodes, some of them by several times while retaining
   high content of active cathode material. The study demonstrates that
   LBL-assembled composites enable resolution of difficult materials
   engineering tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Radiative thermal transport via the fluctuating electromagnetic near-
   field has recently attracted increasing attention due to its fundamental
   importance and its impact on a range of applications from data storage
   to thermal management and energy conversion. After a brief historical
   account of radiative thermal transport, we summarize the basics of
   fluctuational electrodynamics, a theoretical framework for the study of
   radiative heat transfer in terms of thermally excited propagating and
   evanescent electromagnetic waves. Various approaches to modeling near-
   field thermal transport are briefly discussed, together with key results
   and proposals for manipulation and utilization of radiative heat flow.
   Subsequently, we review the experimental advances in the
   characterization of both near- field heat flow and energy density. We
   conclude with remarks on the opportunities and challenges for future
   explorations of radiative heat transfer at the nanoscale. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{An efficient method for statistically characterizing multiconductor
   transmission line (MTL) networks subject to a large number of
   manufacturing uncertainties is presented. The proposed method achieves
   its efficiency by leveraging a high-dimensional model representation
   (HDMR) technique that approximates observables (quantities of interest
   in MTL networks, such as voltages/currents on mission-critical circuits)
   in terms of iteratively constructed component functions of only the most
   significant random variables (parameters that characterize the
   uncertainties in MTL networks, such as conductor locations and widths,
   and lumped element values). The efficiency of the proposed scheme is
   further increased using a multielement probabilistic collocation (ME-PC)
   method to compute the component functions of the HDMR. The ME-PC method
   makes use of generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions to
   approximate the component functions, where the expansion coefficients
   are expressed in terms of integrals of the observable over the random
   domain. These integrals are numerically evaluated and the observable
   values at the quadrature/collocation points are computed using a fast
   deterministic simulator. The proposed method is capable of producing
   accurate statistical information pertinent to an observable that is
   rapidly varying across a high-dimensional random domain at a
   computational cost that is significantly lower than that of gPC or Monte
   Carlo methods. The applicability, efficiency, and accuracy of the method
   are demonstrated via statistical characterization of frequency-domain
   voltages in parallel wire, interconnect, and antenna corporate feed
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropic etching, enabled by energetic ion bombardment, is one of the
   primary roles of plasma-assisted materials processing for
   microelectronics fabrication. One challenge in plasma etching is being
   able to control the ion energy-angular distributions (IEADs) from the
   presheath to the surface of the wafer which is necessary for maintaining
   the critical dimension of features. Dual frequency capacitive coupled
   plasmas (DF-CCPs) potentially provide flexible control of IEADs,
   providing high selectivity while etching different materials and
   improved uniformity across the wafer. In this paper, the authors present
   a computational investigation of customizing and controlling IEADs in a
   DF-CCP resembling those industrially employed with both biases applied
   to the substrate holding the wafer. The authors found that the ratio of
   the low-frequency to high-frequency power can be used to control the
   plasma density, provide extra control for the angular width and energy
   of the IEADs, and to optimize etch profiles. If the phases between the
   low frequency and its higher harmonics are changed, the sheath dynamics
   are modulated, which in turn produces modulation in the ion energy
   distribution. With these trends, continuously varying the phases between
   the dual-frequencies can smooth the high frequency modulation in the
   time averaged IEADs. For validation, results from the simulation are
   compared with Langmuir probe measurements of ion saturation current
   densities in a DF-CCP. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{We report herein on the hydrothermal catalytic liquefaction of soy
   protein concentrate. Catalyst,screening experiments have shown that
   metal catalysts (e.g., 5 wt \% Pt, Pd, or Ru) supported on porous solids
   (e.g., carbon, Al2O3) produce crude bio-oils with less heteroatom
   content-than does noncatalytic liquefaction of this material under
   otherwise identical conditions. The catalysts had little influence on
   the biocrude yield. Of-the different catalytic materials tested, Ru/C
   had the greatest influence on the biocrude composition. The heating
   value of the;biocrude produced from liquefaction at 350 degrees C for
   120 min with a 20 wt \% loading of Ru/C was 16\% higher than the
   heating-value from the noncatalytic run (37 MJ/kg vs 43 MJ/kg).
   Moreover, the heteroatom content of this biocrude from catalytic
   liquefaction was less than half that of its noncatalytic counterpart
   (16.6 wt \% vs 7.8 wt \%). The catalyst reduced sulfur levels in the
   biocrude to below detection limits and the nitrogen level to 45\% of
   that in the noncatalytic product. Additional experiments with the Ru/C
   catalyst showed only modest improvements, in biocrude quality with
   increasing catalyst loading or liquefaction temperature or time. The
   presence of the Ru/C catalyst shifted the distribution of products
   amenable to gas chromatography (GC), analysis from being primarily
   heterocyclic nitrogen-containing compounds and fatty acid amides to
   being primarily single-ring aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolics. Taken
   collectively, these results show that heterogeneous catalysts can be
   effective during hydrothermal liquefaction of material rich hi protein.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of ethanol on reducing the particulate emissions of a direct
   injection spark ignition (DISI) engine were investigated using a
   single-cylinder, optically accessible engine. Neat anhydrous ethanol was
   compared with a baseline fuel of reference grade gasoline. A high speed
   camera was used to record crank-angle resolved in-cylinder images of the
   fuel spray, combustion, and thermal radiation from the soot formed for
   the engine operating conditions studied. Particulate emissions in the
   engine exhaust gas were also measured using opacity measurements (i.e.,
   using a smoke meter). All experiments were conducted at the same load
   conditions with a net indicated mean effective pressure of IMEPnet
   approximate to 5.5 bar and an intake manifold absolute pressure of 76
   kPa. The engine speed was fixed at 1500 rpm, and the fuel injection
   duration was controlled to achieve stoichiometric combustion. Spark
   timing was adjusted to target combustion phasing (CA50) of 80 degrees
   aTDC. The effects of engine coolant temperature and fuel injection
   timing on fuel spray characteristics and soot formation were studied for
   each fuel. The imaging data indicate that soot formation is a strong
   function of liquid fuel impingement on the piston surface, consistent
   with previous in-cylinder imaging studies of soot formation in DISI
   engines using different engine hardware and imaging orientation. A
   quantitative metric was applied to the imaging data of this work, and
   the in-cylinder soot formation based on the imaging data were in good
   agreement with the engine-out smoke measurements, indicating the optical
   imaging results are representative of engine-out particulate emissions.
   Higher coolant temperatures and later fuel injection timing
   significantly mitigated the in-cylinder soot emissions for both fuels by
   altering the fuel spray interactions with the piston surface and
   cylinder liner. As expected based on previous studies, ethanol
   systematically produced less soot than gasoline for each operating
   condition. Features of the fuel spray roll-up were identified as
   important indicators of pool fires on the piston surface for the
   earliest fuel injection timings.}},

   high angular tolerant performance up to +/- 70 degrees for any
   polarization state of an incident light wave, which is highly desirable
   for a broad range of research areas. Moreover, the purity of the color
   and luminous intensity of the proposed device are improved as compared
   to conventional colorant-based color filters and colloidal glasses. The
   present approach may have the potential to replace existing color
   filters and pigments and pave the way for various applications,
   including color displays and image sensor technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Practical solar energy solutions must not only reduce the cost of the
   module, but also address the substantial balance of system costs. Here,
   we demonstrate a counter-intuitive approach based on gallium arsenide
   solar cells that can achieve extremely low-cost solar energy conversion
   with an estimated cost of only 3\% that of conventional gallium arsenide
   solar cells using an accelerated, non-destructive epitaxial lift-off
   wafer recycling process along with a lightweight, thermoformed plastic,
   truncated mini-compound parabolic concentrator that avoids the need for
   active solar tracking. Using solar cell/concentrator assemblies whose
   orientations are adjusted only a few times per year, the annual energy
   harvesting is increased by 2.8 times compared with planar solar cells
   without solar tracking. These results represent a potentially drastic
   cost reduction in both the module and the balance of system costs
   compared with heavy, rigid conventional modules and trackers that are
   subject to wind loading damage and high installation costs.}},

Title = {{Removal of Residual Cavitation Nuclei to Enhance Histotripsy Erosion of
   Model Urinary Stones}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy has been shown to be an effective treatment for model kidney
   stones, eroding their surface to tiny particulate debris via a
   cavitational bubble cloud. However, similar to shock wave lithotripsy,
   histotripsy stone treatments display a rate-dependent efficacy, with
   pulses applied at a low rate generating more efficient stone erosion in
   comparison with those applied at a high rate. This is hypothesized to be
   the result of residual cavitation bubble nuclei generated by bubble
   cloud collapse. Although the histotripsy bubble cloud only lasts on the
   order of 100 mu s, these microscopic remnant bubbles can persist on the
   order of 1 s, inducing direct attenuation of subsequent histotripsy
   pulses and influencing bubble cloud dynamics. In an effort to mitigate
   these effects, we have developed a novel strategy to actively remove
   residual cavitation nuclei from the field using low-amplitude ultrasound
   pulses. Previous work has demonstrated that with selection of the
   appropriate acoustic parameters these bubble removal pulses can
   stimulate the aggregation and subsequent coalescence of microscopic
   bubble nuclei, effectively deleting them from the target volume. Here,
   we incorporate bubble removal pulses in histotripsy treatment of model
   kidney stones. It was found that when histotripsy is applied at low rate
   (1 Hz), bubble removal does not produce a statistically significant
   change in erosion. At higher pulse rates of 10, 100, and 500 Hz,
   incorporating bubble removal results in 3.7-, 7.5-, and 2.7-fold
   increases in stone erosion, respectively. High-speed imaging indicates
   that the introduction of bubble removal pulses allows bubble cloud
   dynamics resulting from high pulse rates to more closely approximate
   those generated at the low rate of 1 Hz. These results corroborate
   previous work in the field of shock wave lithotripsy regarding the ill
   effects of residual bubble nuclei, and suggest that high treatment
   efficiency can be recovered at high pulse rates through appropriate
   manipulation of the cavitation environment surrounding the stone.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of temperature on the electrical characteristics of the short

   shows that the fabricated TFTarrays are acceptable and stable enough for

   crystal displays in size larger than 55 in. We observed that studied
   a-IGZO TFT arrays obeyed the Meyer-Neldel (MN) rule over a broad range
   of gate bias voltages. The MN rule and exponential subgap density of
   states (DOS) model were combined to extract the DOS distribution for the
   investigated a-IGZO TFT arrays. The results were consistent with the
   previous works on single a-IGZO TFTs. This study demonstrates that this
   method of DOS extraction can be applied to both single devices and
   arrays, and is reproducible from lab to lab. We believe that this

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this work we perform coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations to study the molecular origins of the thermal shape memory
   effect in crosslinked polymer materials. Thermal shape memory polymers
   (SMPs) are materials able to hold a deformed shape when cooled below the
   glass transition temperature, and subsequently recover the initial shape
   when heated. To use SMPs in various applications requires materials
   which reliably hold and recover their shapes; this has sparked recent
   synthesis work to create new SMP materials with optimized properties.
   Here we use coarse-grained MD simulations with different polymer chain
   models to determine which parameters affect relevant SMP behavior and to
   investigate the molecular mechanisms at the level of individual chains
   during temperature cycling. The simulations show how
   temperature-dependent chain mobility leads to shape memory polymer
   behavior. In particular, we demonstrate the importance of attractive
   monomer interactions in leading to `good' SMP behavior. The results
   suggest promising routes for material development. Additionally, the
   mechanisms identified with the simple simulation model can be used to
   inform multi-scale models of SMP material behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Microvascular shape memory polymer (SMP) composites are a new class of
   active composites consisting of an embedded microvascular network in a
   SMP matrix. The microvascular network can be used to deliver thermal,
   chemical, electrical, and magnetic stimulation to the SMP matrix thus
   integrating the activation/deactivation mechanism and opening up a new
   functional space for active polymers. Here, we focus on thermomechanical
   coupling triggered through fluid transport within the polymer. A
   modified thermo-viscoelastic model is used to simulate the response of
   microvascular SMP composites. The model is developed within a finite
   deformation continuum mechanics framework and captures the free recovery
   response of the SMP composite. The present model includes two glass
   transition temperatures to describe the structural relaxation time and
   the stress relaxation time, respectively. The model results are
   calibrated with experimental data from the literature. Lined and unlined
   microvascular composites fabricated with a varying number of channels
   and thermal profiles were recorded by infrared camera. Using a range of
   thermal inputs, we calculate the corresponding free recovery response of
   microvascular SMP composites. We show that the response can be optimized

   spacing, inlet temperature, fluid flow rate, and the heating/cooling

Abstract = {{A series of three energetic cocrystals containing
   5,5'-dinitro-2H,2H'-3,3'-bi-1,2,4-triazole (DNBT) were obtained. These
   incorporate a class of energetic materials that has seen significant
   synthetic work, the azole family (tetrazoles, triazole, pyrazole, etc.),
   and yet have struggled to see broad application. A cocrystal was
   obtained with the triazole 5-amino-3-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazole (ANTA) in a
   stoichiometry of 2:1 (ANTA:DNBT). Two cocrystals were obtained with the
   pyrazoles 1H,4H-3,6-dinitropyrazolo{[}4,3-c]pyrazole (DNPP) and
   3,4-dinitropyrazole (3,4-DNP) in ratios of 1:1 (DNPP:DNBT) and 2:1
   (3,4-DNP:DNBT). All three cocrystals, 2:1 ANTA/DNBT (1), 1:1 DNPP/DNBT
   (2), and 2:1 3,4-DNP/DNBT (3), have high densities (>1.800 g/cm(3)) and
   high predicted detonation velocities (>8000 m/s). In small-scale impact
   drop tests, cocrystals 1 and 2 were both found to be insensitive,
   whereas cocrystal 3 possesses sensitivity between that of its two pure
   components 3,4-DNP and DNBT. The hydrogen bonding motif of the three
   components with DNBT is preserved among all three cocrystals, and this
   observation suggests a generally useful motif to be employed in the
   development of other energetic energetic cocrystals. These cocrystals
   represent an area of energetic materials that has yet to be explored for
   cocrystalline materials.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic response of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H)
   thin-film transistor (TFT) and amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) TFT are
   compared. We study the storage capacitor (C-st) charging characteristics
   by applying gate and data voltage waveforms corresponding to ultra-high
   definition (UHD) active-matrix liquid crystal displays (AM-LCDs). We
   show that the charging behavior of the a-Si: H TFT is insufficient for
   UHD AM-LCDs and that the a-IGZO TFT is capable of supporting at least 8
   K x 4 K display resolution at 480 Hz. The impact of C-st and gate
   voltage falling edge (t(FE)) on feedthrough voltage (Delta V-P) is
   investigated. Because of higher mobility of the a-IGZO TFT, it is
   possible to reduce Delta V-P by mitigating channel charge redistribution
   with non-abrupt t(FE). The a-IGZO TFT shows no drawbacks in terms of
   Delta V-P when compared to the a-Si: H TFT. In addition, a larger C-st
   can be used in combination with the a-IGZO TFT to reduce Delta V-P with
   minimal impact on its charging behavior. Gate overdrive operation is
   also evaluated for the a-IGZO TFT, which may improve charging
   characteristics with no adverse effects on Delta V-P. Our results show
   that the a-IGZO TFT is a suitable technology for UHD high-frame rate
   AM-LCDs.}},

Title = {{Optimizing tradeoffs among housing sustainability objectives}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{83-94}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The sustainability of housing units can be improved by integrating green
   building equipment and systems such as energy-efficient HVAC systems,
   building envelopes, water heaters, appliances, and water-efficient
   fixtures. The use of these green building measures often improves the
   environmental and social performances of housing units; however they can
   increase their initial cost and life cycle cost This paper presents a
   multi-objective optimization model that is capable of optimizing housing
   design and construction decisions in order to generate
   optimal/near-optimal tradeoffs among the three sustainability objectives
   of maximizing the operational environmental performance of housing
   units, maximizing the social quality of life for their residents, and
   minimizing their life cycle cost The model is designed as a
   multi-objective genetic algorithm to provide the capability of
   optimizing multiple housing objectives and criteria that include
   minimizing carbon footprint and water usage during housing operational
   phase, maximizing thermal comfort, enhancing indoor air and lighting
   quality, improving neighborhood quality, and minimizing life cycle cost
   An application example is analyzed to illustrate the use of the
   developed model and evaluate its performance. The results of this
   analysis illustrate the novel capabilities of the model in generating
   210 near-optimal tradeoff solutions for the analyzed housing example,
   where each represents an optimal/near-optimal and unique tradeoff among
   the aforementioned three sustainability optimization objectives of
   maximizing the operational environmental performance of housing units,
   maximizing the social quality of life for their residents, and
   minimizing their life cycle cost These novel capabilities of the
   developed model are expected to improve the design and construction of
   housing units and maximize their overall sustainability. (C) 2015

   32 kb SRAM shows 35\% energy savings at iso-quality and operates at a

Abstract = {{This paper reports on complex permittivity values of different natural
   and synthetic materials at J-band (220-325 GHz). The materials
   considered in this study include different types of fabrics (wool,
   polyester, acrylic, jeans, vinyl, and cow leather), in addition to human
   skin. For the wool and jeans materials, we consider both dry and wet
   conditions. The knowledge of dielectric constant of these materials is
   needed for evaluation of radar based concealed object detection methods.
   The measurement setup used consists mainly of a vector network analyzer
   (VNA) combined with two J-band frequency extenders. A free space
   transmission only measurement technique is used to obtain both the
   complex dielectric constant and the effective thickness of all the
   fabric materials. Such approach is adequate for fabric materials as they
   do not have a well-defined thickness. The major factors affecting the
   uncertainty in the measurements are shown to be related to the sample
   thickness inhomogeneity, and to the unrepeatability of the network
   analyzer measurement itself. For the human skin case, a reflection
   measurement method from a terminated waveguide is adapted.}},

Abstract = {{To distinguish it clearly from nonlinear viscoelasticity, we define
   ``ideal thixotropy{''} as ``a time-dependent viscous response to the
   history of the strain rate, with fading memory of that history,{''}
   endowing such fluids with memory but no elasticity. An ``ideal
   thixotropic fluid{''} has instantaneous stress relaxation upon cessation
   of flow and no elastic recoil on removal of stress. We describe
   ``nonideal thixotropic{''} fluids as those whose viscoelastic time
   scales governing stress relaxation are much shorter than those governing
   the thixotropic response. This ensures that a clear distinction can be
   maintained between ``thixotropy{''} and ``nonlinear viscoelasticity.{''}
   The stress tensor for an ideal thixotropic fluid can in general be
   expressed as a contraction product of a fourth rank viscosity tensor
   with the velocity gradient tensor, in which the viscosity tensor depends
   on the history of the flow. We show examples of constitutive equations
   that meet the definitions of ideal thixotropy or nonideal thixotropy. We
   also show examples of constitutive equations that have been designated
   as ``thixotropic{''} by virtue of containing an equation for evolution
   of a ``structure parameter,{''} but whose behavior is indistinguishable
   from that of ordinary nonlinear viscoelasticity, and so should not be
   considered thixotropic. (C) 2015 The Society of Rheology.}},

   surface roughness. Using layered medium Green's functions, we derive the
   Lippmann-Schwinger equation in the spectral domain with scattering
   potentials for the case of surface roughness over a layered medium.
   Because of deep subwavelength surface roughness, the scattering
   potentials are next approximated by the small potential approximation,
   so that the solutions of fields in the spectral domain can be readily
   computed. Numerical results are illustrated for the surface fields on
   the rough surface and the fields in the image plane. For periodic
   roughness, small periods, on the order of 0.1 lambda, and small heights,
   on the order of 0.01 lambda, are used. For the case of random roughness,
   we choose the correlation length to be much smaller than a wavelength,
   on the order of 0.1 lambda, and height on the order of 0.01 lambda. The
   results of the fields on the rough surface in the spectral domain show
   that subwavelength roughness creates fields with wave vector components
   that are many times larger than the free-space wavenumber (similar to
   10k(0) or larger). In the spatial domain, the imaging is enhanced by the
   deep subwavelength roughness. Results of the small roughness
   approximation are in good agreement with that of exact potential and
   that of the method of moments. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Real-time lane detection is an important element for driver assistance
   systems in rapidly changing traffic scenarios. In this paper, an
   embedded lane detection platform combining a high-dynamic-range image
   sensor is proposed. As for the software development, a multiscale
   matched filter scheme is successfully used to enhance the local contrast
   between the lane markings and the background interference for different
   traffic scenarios. Then, an intelligent constant-false-alarm-rate
   detector is designed to generate an adaptive threshold for extraction of
   the lane markings. As for hardware implementation, a field programmable
   gate array is used for obtaining a high-dynamic-range image, and then
   matched filters achieve their optimal design based on the coefficient
   decomposition technology in the form of a fixed point number.
   Subsequently, through a high-speed serial peripheral interface bus, all
   pre-processed data are transferred to an ARM processor, which takes
   charge of extraction of the lane markings and also lane fitting.
   Experiments and evaluation prove that the proposed system can
   effectively detect the lane markings for different traffic scenarios in
   a time of 11.64ms for each frame.}},

Abstract = {{Whether an arm will buckle under an impulsive end-load should partly
   depend on the elastic and viscous properties of the pretensed arm
   muscles. In measuring these properties we hypothesized that neither age,
   gender, nor muscle pre-contraction level would affect the bilinear elbow
   or shoulder lumped rotational stiffness or damping parameters in the
   impulsively end-loaded upper extremity of 38 healthy men and women.
   Subjects were instructed to preactivate triceps to either 25, 50 or 75\%
   of maximum myoelectric activity levels. Then a standardized impulsive
   end-load was applied via a 6-axis load cell to the wrist of the slightly
   flexed arm in the prone posture. Arm kinematic responses were acquired
   at 280 Hz and an inverse dynamics analysis was used to estimate the
   bilinear rotational stiffnesses and damping parameters at the elbow and
   shoulder. The results show that pre-contraction level affected
   normalized joint rotational stiffness and damping coefficients (p <
   0.02). Age affected the initial stiffness for the elbow (p < 0.05), and
   gender affected that of the shoulder in the sagittal plane (p < 0.006).
   Arm muscle strength was positively related to normalized stiffness at
   the elbow, but not the shoulder. We conclude that age, gender and
   pre-contraction level each affect the viscoelastic behavior of the
   end-loaded upper extremity in healthy adults.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers radio resource allocation (RRA) in the downlink of
   an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDM)-based
   spectrum-sharing network. The objective of RRA is to maximize the
   average achievable throughput subject to the primary service
   interference threshold and the secondary service transmit power
   constraint. RRA is usually implemented based on a time window T over
   which system parameters are averaged and checked against resource
   constraints. We use short-term (T = 1 time slot) and long-term (T >> 1
   slots) averaging as approximations to instantaneous and average
   constraints, respectively. RRA is also investigated for this system with
   long-term interference threshold and short-term interference threshold
   constraints. RRA optimization is a nonconvex optimization problem in
   which the duality principle is adopted to obtain approximate solutions.
   The duality gap indicates the degree of approximation in the
   thus-obtained solution. We prove that the duality gap corresponding to
   each resource allocation asymptotically decays at least with an
   exponential rate of T. We further show that OFDMA is, asymptotically,
   the optimal subcarrier assignment. We also propose a practically
   implementable online power and subcarrier allocation with on-the-fly
   channel state information measurement. An extensive simulation study has
   been conducted to verify the theoretically predicted duality gap
   behavior and to investigate the impact of different system parameters on
   the secondary service performance. The developed algorithms are also
   validated to be robust in practical settings and converge fast to
   theoretical bounds, and thus practically implementable.}},

Abstract = {{The operation of the power grid is becoming more stressed, due to the
   addition of new large loads represented by electric vehicles (EVs) and a
   more intermittent supply due to the incorporation of renewable sources.
   As a consequence, the coordination and control of projected EV demand in
   a network of fast charging stations becomes a critical and challenging
   problem. In this paper, we introduce a game theoretic based
   decentralized control mechanism to alleviate negative impacts from the
   EV demand. The proposed mechanism takes into consideration the
   nonuniform spatial distribution of EVs that induces uneven power demand
   at each charging facility, and aims to: 1) avoid straining grid
   resources by offering price incentives, so that customers accept being
   routed to less busy stations; 2) maximize total revenue by serving more
   customers with the same amount of grid resources; and 3) provide
   charging service to customers with a certain level of quality-of-service
   (QoS), the latter defined as the long term customer blocking
   probability. We examine three scenarios of increased complexity that
   gradually approximate real world settings. The obtained results show
   that the proposed framework leads to substantial performance
   improvements in terms of the aforementioned goals when compared to
   current state of affairs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A theoretical framework for optical granulometry of sands by a wavelet
   transformation method is presented. The Haar wavelet transformation is
   explained by using simple mathematics with comparisons drawn to the use
   of wavelet decomposition in image compression and image enhancement. The
   use of seven wavelet decomposition levels on thousands of 128x128pixel
   areas of a much larger image of a soil specimen presorted by size yields
   the soil's particle-size distribution. The method employs previously
   developed calibration curves of a wavelet index (CA) versus the average
   number of pixels per particle diameter (PPD). The curves are nonlinear
   in CA versus log10(PPD) space. This paper demonstrates that the
   nonlinearity stems from having to use a relatively low number of
   decomposition levels. With future advances in camera technology, a
   linear CA versus log10(PPD) calibration curve could be developed
   requiring a single soil texture index (T) parameter.}},

Title = {{BIM-Based Construction Scheduling Method Using Optimization Theory for
   Reducing Activity Overlaps}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{As building information modeling (BIM) systems continue to be widely
   adopted, there is an increasing demand for an active construction
   schedule management system with more advanced decision-making
   capabilities. For example, if overlapping between construction
   activities is significant, the performance of construction operations
   for the corresponding activities may deteriorate. Thus, a viable
   construction schedule should be formulated in order to minimize
   overlapping of proximate construction activities. An active system can
   be regarded as a certain solution for this issue. The purpose of this
   study is to develop a systematic methodology and computer system for an
   optimal construction schedule simulation that minimize overlapping
   activities for the enhancement of a project's operational performance.
   This study centers on identifying overlapping activities, applying fuzzy
   theory, and analyzing risk levels for schedule overlap issues. In
   addition, genetic algorithm (GA) theory is adopted for the minimization
   of the overlapping of highly risky activities. Finally, an optimal
   construction schedule that minimizes overlapping activities is
   suggested. The optimal schedule is visualized in a BIM-based
   four-dimensional (4D) computer-aided design (CAD) environment. The 4D
   CAD system developed in this study includes fuzzy and GA analysis
   functions with a schedule simulator. A case study on an actual project
   is introduced to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Water is a requirement for life as we know it(1). Indirect evidence of
   transient liquid water has been observed from orbiter on equatorial
   Mars(2), in contrast with expectations from large-scale climate models.
   The presence of perchlorate salts, which have been detected at Gale
   crater on equatorial Mars by the Curiosity rover(3,4), lowers the
   freezing temperature of water(5). Moreover, perchlorates can form stable
   hydrated compounds and liquid solutions by absorbing atmospheric water
   vapour through deliquescence(6,7). Here we analyse relative humidity,
   air temperature and ground temperature data from the Curiosity rover at
   Gale crater and find that the observations support the formation of
   night-time transient liquid brines in the uppermost 5 cm of the
   subsurface that then evaporate after sunrise. We also find that changes
   in the hydration state of salts within the uppermost 15 cm of the
   subsurface, as measured by Curiosity, are consistent with an active
   exchange of water at the atmosphere-soil interface. However, the water
   activity and temperature are probably too low to support terrestrial
   organisms(8). Perchlorates are widespread on the surface of Mars(9) and
   we expect that liquid brines are abundant beyond equatorial regions
   where atmospheric humidity is higher and temperatures are lower.}},

   of the engine and generators are analyzed to improve the calculation
   precision. In addition, the state of health of the battery is taken into
   account to extend the application of the proposed method. Simulations

   inactivation of ARGs and intI1 genes (chlorine dose of 160 mg/L with
   contact time of 120 min for 2.98-3.24 log reductions of ARGs) than UV
   irradiation (UV dose of 12,477 mJ/cm(2) for 2.48-2.74 log reductions of
   ARGs) and ozonation disinfection (ozonation dose of 177.6 mg/L for
   1.68-2.55 log reductions of ARGs). The 16S rDNA was more efficiently
   removed than ARGs by ozone disinfection. The relative abundance of
   selected genes (normalized to 16S rDNA) increased during ozonation and
   with low doses of UV and chlorine disinfection. Inactivation of sul1 and
   tetG showed strong positive correlations with the inactivation of intI1
   genes (for sul1, R (2) = 0.929 with p < 0.01; for tetG, R (2) = 0.885
   with p < 0.01). Compared to other technologies (ultraviolet
   disinfection, ozonation disinfection, Fenton oxidation, and
   coagulation), chlorination is an alternative method to remove ARGs from
   wastewater effluents. At a chlorine dose of 40 mg/L with 60 min contact
   time, the selected genes inactivation efficiency could reach 1.65-2.28

Abstract = {{Error detection and correction (EDAC) has become more important with
   continued device scaling. We propose a field-programmable gate array
   (FPGA)-based simulator to accelerate the transient simulation of
   pipeline-level EDAC circuits and their interactions with circuits under
   test (CUTs). The simulator incorporates the CUT delay profile, the CUT
   error profile, and the EDAC model. The FPGA-based simulator captures the
   fine-grained interactions between the CUT and EDAC for the evaluation of
   the effectiveness of EDAC and its tuning. The simulator is constructed
   based on parameterized models, making it general purpose and widely
   applicable. We demonstrate the capability of this simulator in the
   evaluation of two popular pipeline-level EDAC designs, i.e., preedge
   EDAC and postedge EDAC, using synthesized processors that operate under
   generic error and noise models. The proposed error simulator uncovers
   key insights to help guide EDAC designs.}},

Abstract = {{A model-based control strategy to track combustion phasing during load
   and speed transitions in the homogeneous charge compression ignition
   (HCCI) operating region of a multimode combustion engine is presented in
   this paper. HCCI transitions can traverse regions of high cyclic
   variability (CV), even if the steady state transition end points are
   stable with low CV. A control-oriented HCCI model for both the stable,
   low CV region and the oscillatory, high CV, late phasing region is used
   to design a controller that uses valve and fuel injection timings to
   track combustion phasing. Novel aspects of the controller include
   nonlinear model-inversion-based feedforward and gain scheduled feedback
   based on unburned fuel that reduces transient CV. Transitions tested on
   a multicylinder HCCI engine include load transitions at fixed engine
   speeds, simultaneous load, and speed transitions, and select FTP75
   drive-cycle transitions with high load slew rates. Good combustion
   phasing tracking performance is demonstrated, and misfires are
   prevented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a lumped-mass dynamic model of a single degree of freedom
   cable-actuated system is derived, and passivity-based control is
   considered. The dynamic model developed takes into consideration the
   changing cable stiffness and mass as the cable is wrapped around a
   winch. In addition, the change in the winch inertia as the cable is
   wrapped around the winch is modeled. It is assumed that the mass of the
   payload is much greater than the mass of the cables and the equivalent
   mass of the winches, which allows for an approximation where the rigid
   dynamics can be decoupled from the elastic dynamics of the system. This
   approximation enables the definition of a modified input torque and
   modified output rate, allowing the establishment of passive input-output
   mappings. Passivity-based controllers are investigated, shown to render
   the closed-loop system input-output stable, and tested in simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing voltage sensing in a battery pack is beneficial for cutting the
   cost of the battery management system. In this paper, a methodology is
   designed to estimate the states of charge (SOC) of two cells connected
   in series when only their total voltage is measured. First, the
   feasibility is analyzed based on the nonlinear observability of the
   two-cell string under reduced voltage sensing. Furthermore,
   observability analysis is performed to different battery chemistries to
   determine their respective observable SOC ranges based on the
   voltage-SOC relationship. A trajectory-based nonlinear observer, the
   Newton observer, is then designed for SOC estimation and has been
   validated by experiments. The limitation of extending the method to
   strings with more than two cells is also discussed. The methodology is
   initially designed under the assumption of equal and known capacity and
   resistance among cells. The robustness of estimation is finally
   investigated when the above assumptions do not hold.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the asymptotic performance of Abelian group
   codes for the channel coding problem for arbitrary discrete (finite

   for arbitrary discrete (finite alphabet) memoryless sources. For the
   channel coding problem, we find the capacity characterized in a
   single-letter information-theoretic form. This simplifies to the
   symmetric capacity of the channel when the underlying group is a field.
   For the source coding problem, we derive the achievable rate-distortion
   function that is characterized in a single-letter information-theoretic
   form. When the underlying group is a field, it simplifies to the
   symmetric rate-distortion function. We give several illustrative
   examples. Due to the nonsymmetric nature of the sources and channels
   considered, our analysis uses a synergy of information-theoretic and

Abstract = {{Type III collagen (Col3) has been proposed to play a key role in tissue
   repair based upon its temporospatial expression during the healing
   process of many tissues, including bone. Given our previous finding that
   Col3 regulates the quality of cutaneous repair, as well as our recent
   data supporting its role in regulating osteoblast differentiation and
   trabecular bone quantity, we hypothesized that mice with diminished Col3
   expression would exhibit altered long-bone fracture healing. To
   determine the role of Col3 in bone repair, young adult wild-type
   (Col3+/+) and haploinsufficent (Col3+/-) mice underwent bilateral tibial
   fractures. Healing was assessed 7, 14, 21, and 28 days following
   fracture utilizing microcomputed tomography (microCT),
   immunohistochemistry, and histomorphometry. MicroCT analysis revealed a
   small but significant increase in bone volume fraction in Col3+/- mice
   at day 21. However, histological analysis revealed that Col3+/- mice
   have less bone within the callus at days 21 and 28, which is consistent
   with the established role for Col3 in osteogenesis. Finally, a reduction
   in fracture callus osteoclastic activity in Col3+/- mice suggests Col3
   also modulates callus remodeling. Although Col3 haploinsufficiency
   affected biological aspects of bone repair, it did not affect the regain
   of mechanical function in the young mice that were evaluated in this
   study. These findings provide evidence for a modulatory role for Col3 in
   fracture repair and support further investigations into its role in
   impaired bone healing. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published

Abstract = {{Objectives:Significant data exist regarding heat production of twist
   drills; however, there are little data regarding cannulated drills or
   Kirschner (K) wires. This study compared the heat produced during bone
   drilling with twist drills, K wires, and a cannulated drill. It was
   hypothesized that drilling temperature would increase with tool sizes
   used in orthopaedic surgery; with twist drills producing the least
   amount of heat followed by cannulated drills and K wires.Methods:Twist
   drills (2.0, 2.5, and 3.5 mm), K wires (1.25, 1.6, and 2.0 mm), and a
   cannulated drill (2.7 mm) were driven into warmed human cadaveric tibia
   by a battery-powered hand drill. The drill was secured on a
   servo-controlled linear actuator to provide a constant advancing speed
   (1 mm/s) during drilling. Two thermocouples were embedded 2 mm from the
   surface at 0.5 and 1.5 mm from the drill hole margin. Eight tests were
   performed for each tool.Results:Twist drills exhibited a positive trend
   between size and heat production. The size effect was less significant
   with K wires. K wires resulted in significantly (P = 0.008 at 0.5 mm)
   higher peak temperatures than twist drills of the same size. A 2.7-mm
   cannulated drill produced more than double the temperature rise of a
   2.5-mm twist drill.Conclusions:Twist drills produced the smallest
   temperature rise among all bit types. Thermal effects should not be a
   reason for choosing K-wire size. The cannulated drill showed
   significantly higher temperatures when compared with standard drills,
   reaching maximal temperatures comparable with K wires.}},

Abstract = {{The diverse roles of protein kinase C-delta (PKC delta) in cellular
   growth, survival, and injury have been attributed to stimulus-specific
   differences in PKC delta signaling responses. PKC delta exerts
   membrane-delimited actions in cells activated by agonists that stimulate
   phosphoinositide hydrolysis. PKC delta is released from membranes as a
   Tyr(313)-phosphorylated enzyme that displays a high level of
   lipid-independent activity and altered substrate specificity during
   oxidative stress. This study identifies an interaction between PKC
   delta's Tyr(313)-phosphorylated hinge region and its
   phosphotyrosine-binding C2 domain that controls PKC delta's enzymology
   indirectly by decreasing phosphorylation in the kinase domain
   ATP-positioning loop at Ser(359). We show that wild-type (WT) PKC delta
   displays a strong preference for substrates with serine as the
   phosphoacceptor residue at the active site when it harbors
   phosphomimetic or bulky substitutions at Ser(359). In contrast, PKC
   delta-S(359)A displays lipid-independent activity toward substrates with
   either a serine or threonine as the phosphoacceptor residue. Additional
   studies in cardiomyocytes show that oxidative stress decreases Ser(359)
   phosphorylation on native PKC delta and that PKC delta-S(359)A
   overexpression increases basal levels of phosphorylation on substrates
   with both phosphoacceptor site serine and threonine residues.
   Collectively, these studies identify a C2 domain-pTyr(313) docking
   interaction that controls ATP-positioning loop phosphorylation as a
   novel, dynamically regulated, and physiologically relevant structural
   determinant of PKC delta catalytic activity.}},

Abstract = {{Compton cameras have become an instrument of interest for long-range
   localization of radioactive materials in nuclear-nonproliferation
   applications. In this work, a specialized simulation tool was developed
   for the optimization of a Compton camera through realistic Monte Carlo
   simulations. This tool can be used for Compton cameras with different
   geometries. The MCNPX-PoliMi code was used to simulate Compton scatters
   and photoelectric absorptions in the camera's detectors. The imaging
   capability is derived from the physics of Compton scattering and the
   full-energy information obtained in photoelectric absorptions. The
   simulated system is a 1 x 1 m(2) Compton camera consisting of two planar
   arrays of photon detectors. Several scintillators were evaluated: LaBr3,
   CaF2, and NaI(Tl) (all inorganic scintillators), and C9H10 (plastic
   organic scintillator). The investigation was carried out with a Cs-137
   source. A minimum detectable activity (MDA) was defined and used to
   assess the performance of cameras based on different detectors. The
   simulation results show that C9H10 is a reliable, low-cost,
   scatter-plane material, increasing the MDA by similar to 0.2 mCi when
   compared to a CaF2 scatter plane. On the other hand, the intrinsic
   background of LaBr3 undermines its above-average energy resolution as
   the MDA increased by similar to 0.5 mCi when compared to a NaI(TI)
   absorption plane. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: One strategy to reconstruct large bone defects is to
   prefabricate a vascularized flap by implanting a biomaterial scaffold
   with associated biologics into the latissimus dorsi and then
   transplanting this construct to the defect site after a maturation
   period. This strategy, similar to all clinically and regulatory feasible
   biologic approaches to surgical reconstruction, requires the ability to
   quickly (<1 h within an operating room) and efficiently bind biologics
   to scaffolds. It also requires the ability to localize biologic
   delivery. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of binding bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) to poly-e-caprolactone (PCL) using
   adsorption and conjugation as a function of time.
   Methods: BMP2 was adsorbed (Ads) or conjugated (Conj) to PCL scaffolds
   with the same three-dimensional printed architecture while altering
   exposure time (0.5, 1, 5, and 16 h), temperature (4 degrees C, 23
   degrees C), and BMP2 concentration (1.4, 5, 20, and 65 mu g/mL). The in
   vitro release was quantified, and C2C12 cell alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
   expression was used to confirm bioactivity. Scaffolds with either 65 or
   20 mu g/mL Ads or Conj BMP2 for 1 h at 23 degrees C were implanted
   subcutaneously in mice to evaluate in vivo bone regeneration.
   Micro-computed tomography, compression testing, and histology were
   performed to characterize bone regeneration.
   Results: After 1 h exposure to 65 mu g/mL BMP2 at 23 degrees C, Conj and
   Ads resulted in 12.83 +/- 1.78 and 10.78 +/- 1.49 mu g BMP2 attached,
   respectively. Adsorption resulted in a positive ALP response and had a
   small burst release; whereas conjugation provided a sustained release
   with negligible ALP production, indicating that the conjugated BMP2 may
   not be bioavailable. Adsorbed 65 mu g/mL BMP2 solution resulted in the
   greatest regenerated bone volume (15.0 +/- 3.0 mm(3)), elastic modulus
   (20.1 +/- 3.0 MPa), and \%bone ingrowth in the scaffold interior
   (17.2\%+/- 5.4\%) when compared with conjugation.
   Conclusion: Adsorption may be optimal for the clinical application of
   prefabricating bone flaps due to BMP2 binding in a short exposure time,
   retained BMP2 bioactivity, and bone growth adhering to scaffold geometry
   and into pores with healthy marrow development.}},

Title = {{Mouse forepaw lumbrical muscles are resistant to age-related declines in
   force production}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{42-45}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and force generating capacity
   occurs with aging. Mice are commonly used in the study of
   aging-associated changes in muscle size and strength, with most models
   of aging demonstrating 15-35\% reductions in muscle mass,
   cross-sectional area (CSA), maximum isometric force production (P-o) and
   specific force (sP(o)), which is P-o/CSA. The lumbrical muscle of the
   mouse forepaw is exceptionally small, with corresponding short diffusion
   distances that make it ideal for in vitro pharmacological studies and
   measurements of contractile properties. However, the aging-associated
   changes in lumbrical function have not previously been reported. To
   address this, we tested the hypothesis that compared to adult (12 month
   old) mice, the forepaw lumbrical muscles of old (30 month old) mice
   exhibit aging-related declines in size and force production similar to
   those observed in larger limb muscles. We found that the forepaw
   lumbricals were composed exclusively of fibers with type II myosin heavy
   chain isoforms, and that the muscles accumulated connective tissue with
   aging. There were no differences in the number of fibers per
   whole-muscle cross-section or in muscle fiber CSA. The whole muscle CSA
   in old mice was increased by 17\%, but the total CSA of all muscle
   fibers in a whole-muscle cross-section was not different. No difference
   in Po was observed, and while sPo normalized to total muscle CSA was
   decreased in old mice by 22\%, normalizing Po by the total muscle fiber
   CSA resulted in no difference in sPo. Combined, these results indicate
   that forepaw lumbrical muscles from 30 month old mice are largely
   protected from the aging-associated declines in size and force
   production that are typically observed in larger limb muscles. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Purpose: Hospital readmissions after radical cystectomy vary with
   respect to intensity in terms of impact on patients and health care
   systems. Therefore, we conducted a population based study to examine
   factors associated with increasing readmission intensity after radical
   cystectomy for bladder cancer.
   Materials and Methods: Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results)-Medicare data we identified 1,782 patients who underwent
   radical cystectomy from 2003 to 2009. We defined readmission intensity
   in terms of length of stay (days) divided into quartiles of less than 3
   (lowest), 3 to 4, 5 to 7 and more than 7 (highest). We used logistic
   regression to examine factors associated with readmission intensity.
   Results: More than half of the patients with the highest intensity
   readmissions were readmitted within the first week and 77\% were
   readmitted within 2 weeks of discharge. Patients with the highest
   intensity readmissions were similar in age, gender, race, socioeconomic
   status, pathological stage, comorbidity, neoadjuvant chemotherapy use
   and urinary diversion type compared to patients with the lowest
   intensity readmissions. After multivariable adjustment, complications
   during the index cystectomy admission (p < 0.001), readmission week
   (p=0.04), and the interaction between index length of stay and discharge
   to a skilled nursing facility (p=0.04) were associated with the highest
   readmission intensity.
   Conclusions: Readmission intensity differs widely after discharge
   following radical cystectomy. As postoperative efforts to minimize the
   readmission burden increase, a better understanding of the factors that
   contribute to the highest intensity readmissions will help direct
   limited resources (eg telephone calls, office visits) toward high yield
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{Histotripsy thrombolysis is a non-invasive, drug-free, image-guided
   therapy that fractionates blood clots using well-controlled acoustic
   cavitation alone. Real-time quantitative feedback is highly desired
   during histotripsy thrombolysis treatment to monitor the progress of
   clot fractionation. Bubble-induced color Doppler (BCD) monitors the
   motion after cavitation generated by each histotripsy pulse, which has
   been found in gel and ex vivo liver tissue to be correlated with
   histotripsy fractionation. We investigated the potential of BCD to
   quantitatively monitor histotripsy thrombolysis in real time. To
   visualize clot fractionation, transparent threelayered fibrin clots were
   developed. Results indicated that a coherent motion follows the
   cavitation generated by each histotripsy pulse with a push and rebound
   pattern. The temporal profile of this motion expands and saturates as
   treatment progresses. A strong correlation exists between the degree of
   histotripsy clot fractionation and two metrics extracted from BCD: time
   of peak rebound velocity (tPRV) and focal mean velocity at a fixed delay
   (Vf, delay). The saturation of clot fractionation (i.e., treatment
   completion) matches well the saturations detected using tPRV and Vf,
   delay. The mean Pearson correlation coefficients between the progression
   of clot fractionation and the two BCD metrics were 93.1\% and 92.6\%,
   respectively. To validate BCD feedback in in vitro clots, debris volumes
   from histotripsy thrombolysis were obtained at different therapy doses
   and compared with Vf, delay. There is also good agreement between the
   increasing and saturation trends of debris volume and Vf, delay.
   Finally, a realtime BCD feedback algorithm to predict complete clot
   fractionation during histotripsy thrombolysis was developed and tested.
   This work illustrates the potential of BCD to monitor histotripsy
   thrombolysis treatment in real time. (C) 2015 World Federation for

Title = {{Network Mechanisms Generating Abnormal and Normal Hippocampal
   High-Frequency Oscillations: A Computational Analysis}},
Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are an intriguing potential biomarker
   for epilepsy, typically categorized according to peak frequency as
   either ripples (100-250 Hz) or fast ripples (>250 Hz). In the
   hippocampus, fast ripples were originally thought to be more specific to
   epileptic tissue, but it is still very difficult to distinguish which
   HFOs are caused by normal versus pathological brain activity. In this
   study, we use a computational model of hippocampus to investigate
   possible network mechanisms underpinning normal ripples, pathological
   ripples, and fast ripples. Our results unify several prior findings
   regarding HFO mechanisms, and also make several new predictions
   regarding abnormal HFOs. We show that HFOs are generic, emergent
   phenomena whose characteristics reflect a wide range of connectivity and
   network input. Although produced by different mechanisms, both normal
   and abnormal HFOs generate similar ripple frequencies, underscoring that
   peak frequency is unable to distinguish the two. Abnormal ripples are
   generic phenomena that arise when input to pyramidal cells overcomes
   network inhibition, resulting in high-frequency, uncoordinated firing.
   In addition, fast ripples transiently and sporadically arise from the
   precise conditions that produce abnormal ripples. Lastly, we show that
   such abnormal conditions do not require any specific network structure
   to produce coherent HFOs, as even completely asynchronous activity is
   capable of producing abnormal ripples and fast ripples in this manner.
   These results provide a generic, network-based explanation for the link
   between pathological ripples and fast ripples, and a unifying
   description for the entire spectrum from normal ripples to pathological
   fast ripples.}},

   participation in ancillary services}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{76-87}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Increasing penetrations of intermittent renewable energy resources will
   require additional power system services. California recently adopted an
   energy storage mandate to support its renewable portfolio standard,
   which requires 33\% of delivered energy from renewables by 2020. The
   objective of this paper is to estimate the amount of energy storage that
   could be provided by residential thermostatically controlled loads, such
   as refrigerators and air conditioners, and the amount of revenue that
   could be earned by loads participating in ancillary services markets. We
   model load aggregations as virtual energy storage, and use simple
   dynamical system models and publicly available data to generate our
   resource and revenue estimates. We find that the resource potential is
   large: 10-40 GW/8-12 GWh, which is significantly more than that required
   by the mandate. We also find that regulation and spinning/non-spinning
   reserve revenues vary significantly depending upon type of load and, for
   heat pumps and air conditioners, climate zone. For example, mean
   regulation revenues for refrigerators are \$11/year, for electric water
   heaters are \$24/year, for air conditioners are \$0-32/year, and for
   heat pumps are \$22-56/year. Both consumer choices, such as appliance
   settings, and policy, such as the design of ancillary service
   compensation and appliance standards, could increase revenue potentials.

Abstract = {{Cooperative relay aims to realize the capacity of multi-antenna arrays
   in a distributed manner. However, the symbol-level synchronization
   requirement among distributed relays limits its use in practice. We
   propose to circumvent this barrier with a cross-layer protocol called
   Distributed Asynchronous Cooperation (DAC). With DAC, multiple relays
   can schedule concurrent transmissions with packet-level (hence coarse)
   synchronization. The receiver then extracts multiple versions of each
   relayed packet via a collision-resolution algorithm, thus realizing the
   diversity gain of cooperative communication. We demonstrate the
   feasibility of DAC by prototyping and testing it on the GNURadio/USRP
   software radio platform. To explore its relevance at the network level,
   we introduce a DAC-based medium access control (MAC) protocol, and a
   generic approach to integration of the DAC MAC/PHY layer into a typical
   routing algorithm. Considering the use of DAC for multiple network
   flows, we analyze the fundamental tradeoff between the improvement in
   diversity gain and the reduction in multiplexing opportunities. DAC is
   shown to improve the throughput and delay performance of lossy networks
   with intermediate link quality. Our analytical results have also been
   confirmed via network-level simulation with ns-2.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of resource-constrained and
   noise-limited localization and estimation of dynamic targets that are
   sparsely distributed over a large area. We generalize an existing
   framework {[}Bashan et al., 2008] for adaptive allocation of sensing
   resources to the dynamic case, accounting for time-varying target
   behavior such as transitions to neighboring cells and varying amplitudes
   over a potentially long time horizon. The proposed adaptive sensing
   policy is driven by minimization of a surrogate function for mean
   squared error within locations containing targets. We provide
   theoretical upper bounds on the performance of adaptive sensing policies
   by analyzing solutions with oracle knowledge of target locations,
   gaining insight into the effect of target motion and amplitude variation
   as well as sparsity. Exact minimization of the multistage objective
   function is infeasible, but myopic optimization yields a closed-form
   solution. We propose a simple non-myopic extension, the Dynamic Adaptive
   Resource Allocation Policy (D-ARAP), that allocates a fraction of
   resources for exploring all locations rather than solely exploiting the
   current belief state. Our numerical studies indicate that D-ARAP has the
   following advantages: (a) it is more robust than the myopic policy to
   noise, missing data, and model mismatch; (b) it performs comparably to
   well-known approximate dynamic programming solutions but at
   significantly lower computational complexity; and (c) it improves
   greatly upon nonadaptive uniform resource allocation in terms of
   estimation error and probability of detection.}},

Abstract = {{Highly diluted, low temperature homogeneous charge compression ignition
   (HCCI) combustion leads to ultralow levels of engine-out NOx emissions.
   A standard drive cycle, however, would require switches between HCCI and
   spark-ignited (SI) combustion modes. In this paper we quantify the
   efficiency benefits of such a multimode combustion engine, when emission
   constraints are to be met with a three-way catalytic converter (TWC).
   The TWC needs unoccupied oxygen storage sites in order to achieve
   acceptable performance. The lean exhaust gas during HCCI operation,
   however, fills the oxygen storage and leads to a drop in NOx conversion
   efficiency. If levels of tailpipe NOx become unacceptable, a mode switch
   to a fuel rich combustion mode is necessary in order to deplete the
   oxygen storage and restore TWC efficiency. The resulting lean-rich
   cycling leads to a penalty in fuel economy. Another form of penalty
   originates from the lower combustion efficiency during a combustion mode
   switch itself. In order to evaluate the impact on fuel economy of those
   penalties, a finite state model for combustion mode switches is combined
   with a longitudinal vehicle model and a phenomenological TWC model,
   focused on oxygen storage. The aftertreatment model is calibrated using
   combustion mode switch experiments from lean HCCI to rich spark-assisted
   HCCI (SA-HCCI) and back. Fuel and emission maps acquired in steady-state
   experiments are used. Different depletion strategies are compared in
   terms of their influence on drive cycle fuel economy and NOx emissions.
   It is shown that even an aggressive lean-rich cycling strategy will
   marginally satisfy the cumulated tailpipe NOx emission standards under
   warmed-up conditions. More notably, the cycling leads to substantial
   fuel penalties that negate most of HCCI's efficiency benefits.}},

Abstract = {{In the classical k-median problem, we are given a metric space and want
   to open k centers so as to minimize the sum (over all the vertices) of
   the distance of each vertex to its nearest open center. In this paper we
   present the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for two
   natural generalizations of this problem that handle matroid or knapsack
   constraints.
   In the matroid median problem, there is an underlying matroid on the
   vertices and the set of open centers is constrained to be independent in
   this matroid. When the matroid is uniform, we recover the k-median
   problem. Another previously studied special case is the red-blue median
   problem where we have a partition matroid with two parts. Our algorithm
   for matroid median is based on rounding a natural linear programming
   relaxation in two stages, and it relies on a connection to matroid
   intersection.
   In the knapsack median problem, centers have weights and the total
   weight of open centers is constrained to be at most a given capacity.
   When all weights are uniform, this reduces to the k-median problem. The
   algorithm for knapsack median is based on a novel LP relaxation that
   constrains the set of centers that each vertex can get connected to. The
   rounding procedure uses a two-stage approach similar to that for matroid
   median.}},

Abstract = {{The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP) satellite is scheduled for launch in January 2015.
   In order to develop robust soil moisture retrieval algorithms that fully
   exploit the unique capabilities of SMAP, algorithm developers had
   identified a need for long-duration combined active and passive L-band
   microwave observations. In response to this need, a joint Canada-U.S.
   field experiment (SMAPVEX12) was conducted in Manitoba (Canada) over a
   six-week period in 2012. Several times per week, NASA flew two aircraft
   carrying instruments that could simulate the observations the SMAP
   satellite would provide. Ground crews collected soil moisture data, crop
   measurements, and biomass samples in support of this campaign. The
   objective of SMAPVEX12 was to support the development, enhancement, and
   testing of SMAP soil moisture retrieval algorithms. This paper details
   the airborne and field data collection as well as data calibration and
   analysis. Early results from the SMAP active radar retrieval methods are
   presented and demonstrate that relative and absolute soil moisture can
   be delivered by this approach. Passive active L-band sensor (PALS)
   antenna temperatures and reflectivity, as well as backscatter, closely
   follow dry down and wetting events observed during SMAPVEX12. The
   SMAPVEX12 experiment was highly successful in achieving its objectives
   and provides a unique and valuable data set that will advance algorithm
   development.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the spontaneous self-assembly of Ge QDs on AlAs, GaAs
   and AlGaAs by high-temperature ina situ pound annealing using molecular
   beam epitaxy (MBE). The morphology of Ge dots formed on AlAs were
   observed by atom probe tomography, which revealed nearly spherical QDs
   with diameters approaching 10 nm and confirmed the complete absence of a
   wetting layer. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction and atomic
   force microscopy of Ge annealed under similar conditions on GaAs and
   Al0.3Ga0.7As surfaces revealed the gradual suppression of QD formation
   with decreasing Al-content of the buffer. To investigate the prospects
   of using encapsulated Ge dots for upconverting photovoltaics, in which
   photocurrent can still be generated from photons with energy less than
   the host bandgap, Ge QDs were embedded into the active region of III-V
   PIN diodes by MBE. It was observed that orders of magnitude higher
   short-circuit current is obtained at photon energies below the GaAs
   bandgap compared with a reference PIN diode without Ge QDs. These
   results demonstrate the promise of Ge QDs for upconverting solar cells
   and the realization of device-quality integration of group IV and III-V
   semiconductors.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop models and algorithms for solving the
   single-satellite, multi-ground station communication scheduling problem,
   with the objective of maximizing the total amount of data downloaded
   from space. With the growing number of small satellites gathering large
   quantities of data in space and seeking to download this data to a
   capacity-constrained ground station network, effective scheduling is
   critical to mission success. Our goal in this research is to develop
   tools that yield highquality schedules in a timely fashion while
   accurately modeling on-board satellite energy and data dynamics as well
   as realistic constraints of the space environment and ground network. We
   formulate an under-constrained mixed integer program (MIP) to model the
   problem. We then introduce an iterative algorithm that progressively
   tightens the constraints of this model to obtain a feasible and thus
   optimal solution. Computational experiments are conducted on diverse
   real-world data sets to demonstrate tractability and solution quality.
   Additional experiments on a broad test bed of contrived problem
   instances are used to test the boundaries of tractability for applying
   this approach to other problem domains. Our computational results
   suggest that our approach is viable for real-world instances, as well as
   providing a strong foundation for more complex problems with multiple
   satellites and stochastic conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An electrically assisted friction stir welding (FSW) system has been
   developed, which enables a local electrical current field moving with
   the FSW tool without requiring the tool to be one of the electrodes. The
   effectiveness of electro-plastic effect, which describes a material
   softening phenomenon during plastic deformation induced by high density
   current, was investigated for FSW of dissimilar Al 6061 to TRIP 780
   steel. Measured temperature results indicate that the electro-plastic
   effect could hardly be separated from resistance heating for this
   process. The relative significance of these two factors depends on
   welding parameters. Axial welding force can be effectively reduced with
   application of current and the phenomenon is more pronounced under a
   lower rotating speed and a smaller tool offset into aluminum.
   Microstructure analysis has been performed for cross sections
   perpendicular to weldline both at beginning and middle position of the
   weld. Enhanced formation of thin layer of intermetallic compounds and
   micro-interlock features at the Al-Fe interface can be observed in
   electrically assisted welding conditions, which are believed to be
   beneficial for joint quality. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We tested Ru/C, Pt/C, Pd/C, Pt/Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3, activated carbon, and
   Ni-Ru/CeO2 catalysts for the gasification of indole in supercritical
   water. All of the materials enhanced the gasification of this
   nitrogen-containing compound, but the bimetallic catalyst, Ni-Ru/CeO2,
   showed the highest activity for producing CO and CH4 and for converting
   indole. We focused on this catalyst in more detail. The catalyst loading
   in the reactor has no effect on the H-2 yield, but both CH4 and CO2
   yields decrease with decreased loading. Water density has no
   statistically significant effect on the yield of gas products, but
   operating above the critical pressure of water is a prerequisite for the
   Ni-Ru composite catalyst to reach a high conversion of indole. The
   catalyst surface area and pore volume decrease from 5.91 m(2) g(-1) and
   0.0169 cm(3) g(-1) to 2.86 m(2) g(-1) and 0.0137 cm(3) g(-1),
   respectively, after an SCWG reaction time of 180 min. NiO species were
   detected in both fresh and used catalysts and may be due to oxidation of
   the reduced Ni metal during sample preparation for XPS analysis, and/or
   a strong interaction between metal and support possibly leading to the
   formation of cationic Ni species. These results point to potential
   benefits of using this bimetallic catalyst for SCWG of streams with
   recalcitrant N-containing compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Surface-Mediated Solvent Decomposition in Li-Air Batteries: Impact of

Abstract = {{A viable Li/O-2 battery will require the development of stable
   electrolytes that do not continuously decompose during cell operation.
   Recent experiments suggest that reactions occurring at the interface
   between the liquid electrolyte and the solid lithium peroxide (Li2O2)
   discharge phase are a major contributor to these instabilities. TO
   clarify the mechanisms associated With these reactions, a Variety of
   atomistic simulation techniques; classical Monte Carlo, van der
   Waals-augmented density functional theory, ab initio molecular dynamics,
   and various solvation models, are used to Study the initial
   decomposition of the common electrolyte solvent, dimethoxyethane (DME),
   on surfaces of Li2O2. Comparisons are made between the two predominant
   Li2O2 surface charge states by calculating decomposition pathways on
   peroxide-terminated (O-2(2-)) and superoxide-terminated, (O-2(1-))
   facets. For both terminations, DME decomposition, proceeds
   exothermically via a two-step process comprised of hydrogen abstraction
   (H-abstraction) followed by nudeophilic attack. In the first step,
   abstracted H dissociates a surface O-2 dimer, and combines with a
   dissociated oxygen to form a hydroxide ion (OH-). The remaining surface
   oxygen then attacks the DME, resulting in a DME fragment that is
   strongly bound to the-Li2O2 Surface. DME decomposition is predicted to
   be more exothermic on the peroxide facet; nevertheless, the rate of DME
   decomposition is faster on the superoxide termination. The impact of
   solvation (explicit vs implicit) and an applied electric field on the
   reaction energetics are investigated. Our calculations suggest that
   surface-mediated electrolyte decomposition should out-phase liquid-phase
   processes such as solvent auto-oxidation by dissolved O-2.}},

Abstract = {{Biocatalysts, especially enzymes, have the ability to catalyze reactions
   with high product selectivity, utilize a broatl range of substrates, and

   production processes using biocatalysts employ soluble enzymes or whole
   cells expressing intracellular enzymes. Cell surface display systems
   differ by presenting heterologous enzymes extracellularly; overcoming
   some of the limitations associated with enzyme purification and
   substrate transport. Additionally, coupled with directed evolution, cell
   surface display is a powerful platform for engineering enzymes with
   enhanced properties. In this review, we will introduce the Molecular and
   cellular principles of cell surface display and discuss how it has been
   applied to engineer enzymes with improved properties as well as to,
   develop surface-engineered microbes as whole-cell biocatalysts.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of the size of targeted, spherical drug carriers has been
   previously explored and reviewed. Particle shape has emerged as an
   equally important patameter in determining the in vivo journey and
   efficiency of drug carrier systems. Researchers have invented techniques
   to better control the geometry of particles of many different materials,
   which have allowed for exploratiOn of the role of particle geometry in
   the phases of drug delivery. The important biological processes include
   clearance by the immune system, trafficking to the target tissue,
   margination to the endothelial surface, interaction with the target
   cell, and controlled release of a payload. The review of current
   literature herein supports that particle shape can be altered to improve
   a system's targeting efficiency. Nonspherical particles can harness the
   potential of targeted drug carriers by enhancing targeted site
   accumulation while simultaneously decreasing Side effects and mitigating
   some limitations faced by spherical carriers.}},

Abstract = {{We used hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of wet algal bionias to
   facilitate.extraction of algal lipids that have value for both liquid
   biofuels and dietary supplements (i.e., nutraceuticals). HTC of the wet
   algal slurry produced a solid hydro char that retained more than 85\% of
   the fatty acids in the original biomass and more than 75\% of the
   valuable rimega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaerioic acid (EPA). The mass
   yield of hydro char was a linear function of the logarithm of the
   reaction ordinate, which is a measure of the severity of the
   carbonization conditions. The retained fatty acids could be readily
   extracted using ethanol, a renewable and food-grade solvent. A total
   fatty acid recovety of 74\% was achieved through this combination of HTC
   and ethanol extraction. Thus, we herein, demonstrate a process for
   removing fatty-acid-containing lipids from Wet algae Using only water
   and a non-petroleum-derived solvent. The recovered lipids include both
   those titable for making biodiesel or green diesel and those suitable
   for the human diet.}},

   Ni/Ce-Zr-O/monolith catalysts in a fixed-bed reactbr at atmospheric

   O/C ratio (0.6-1.1) was investigated. At optimal O/C ratio (0.9) the
   maximum H-2-rich syngas yield could be achieved with both upstream (746
   degrees C) and downstream (709 degrees C) monolith, teniperatures above
   700 degrees C. BET surface area and Ni dispersion were measured, while
   temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), ternperature-programmed
   reduction (TPR), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and X-ray
   diffraction ())were used to characterize carbon deposition and nickel
   status. TPO and SEM showed that carbon deposited on the monolith
   decreases With increasing O/C ratio and along the axial direction from
   upstream to doWnstream. The effect of catalYst calcination treatment
   (700 to 1200 degrees C) on the yields of H-2, CO/CO2, and C-1-C-4,
   hydrocarbon products was also studied with ATR O/C ratios at 06 and 0.9.
   The amount of deposited carbon decreased with increasing calcination
   temperature and a carbon-ree operation could be achieved on the 1000
   degrees C-calcined catalyst. The high-temperature calcination resulted
   in the decrease of H-2 yield but increased- the yield of C-1-C-4
   hydrocarbons. Quantitative H-2 chemisorption and in situ TPR-TPO
   indicated the toss of metallic Ni due to the formation of Ni2SiO4 from
   the solid-state-interaction of Ni and cordierite, which was confirmed by
   XRD of the catalysts calcined at 1200 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{The recombination of lophyl radicals generated by the photOdissociation
   of hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) compounds has been previously reported to
   proceed as either first-, 3/2-, or second-order reactions. Here, we
   re-examine the recombination of HABI-derived lophyl radicals to resolve
   these dispdrate reported recombination reaction orders. EPR spectroscopy
   was used to monitor the radical concentration for two HABI-based
   compounds in solution both during irradiation until steady state was
   achieved, then in the dark, where only the radical recombination
   reaction proceeded. Over short dark periods, lophyl radical
   recombination could be adequately described by second-order reaction
   Idnetics. To better evaluate these reactions, UV-vis spectrophotometry
   measurements were perforrned over longer dark recoinbination periods.
   The molar absorptivities of the lophyt radical species were determined
   and used to express UV-vis absorbance data as radical concentrations.
   Analysis of these radical concentration curves over extended dark
   periods revealed that the recombination reactions at low initial HABI
   concentrations and incident irradiation intensities were well fit as
   3/2- and second-order reactions for the two respective parent HABI
   compounds; however, raised initial HABI concentrations and irradiation
   intensities progressively increased deviation from the reaction order
   fits. The fitted recombination and corresponding photodissociation rate
   constants were validated by predicting radical concentration curves
   using stepped irradiation intensity profiles, which were compared
   against experimentally determined radical concentrations obtained under
   identical reaction conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis and characterization of hematite nanotube arrays for use
   as photo catalysts are described in this paper. Novel morphologies,
   including multilayered and wave-like nanottbe arrays, were synthesized
   via electrochemical anodization of iron foils in electrolytic solutions
   containing ammonium fluoride, ethylene glycol, and water. The nanotube
   formation mechanism was investigated by tracking they current response
   data during anodization. The results indicate that there are four
   distinct stages associated with the evolution of the nanotube arrays: an
   ohmic response stage, an oxide film formation stage, a chemical
   dissolution/pitting stage, and a steady-state growth stage.
   Morphological, optical, and photoelectrochernical properties of the
   resulting materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning
   electron microscopy, UV vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, linear
   sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance Spectroscopy, and incident
   photon to current efficiency (IPCE). The IPCE for the wave-like nanotube
   arrays at 350 nm was similar to 3 times that for the single layer

Abstract = {{Although multiphase transportation of petroleum fluids commonly occurs
   in the field, investigations of wax deposition, have been limited in
   the:case of single-phase oil flow for the past few decades. The
   main,complication for wax deposition research in multiphase flow is the
   variety of flow regimes and one has to analyze the transport
   characteristics in each flow regime. In the area of water-in-oil
   dispersed phase flow, previous studies provide limited information on
   the effects of water droplets on the-mass transfer of wax. This study
   discusses, the increase in the wax diffusion path to reach the pipe wall
   caused by the water droplets. The impact of the water droplets on wax
   molecular diffusion in water-in-oil dispersions is quantified using NMR
   diffusometry. Two commonly used empirical approaches for wax diffusivity
   calculation in single phase flow have been evaluated for water-in-oil
   dispersed flow and neither provides consistent predictions compared to
   experimental measurements. Finally, a fundamental approach for the
   calculation of effective wax diffusivity in water-in-oil dispersion is
   proposed and verified.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing offers the potential for rapid
   customization of medical devices. The advent of 3D-printable
   biomaterials has created the potential for device control in the fourth
   dimension: 3D-printed objects that exhibit a designed shape change under
   tissue growth and resorption conditions over time. Tracheobronchomalacia
   (TBM) is a condition of excessive collapse of the airways during
   respiration that can lead to life-threatening cardiopulmonary arrests.
   We demonstrate the successful application of 3D printing technology to
   produce a personalized medical device for treatment of TBM, designed to
   accommodate airway growth while preventing external compression over a
   predetermined time period before bioresorption. We implanted
   patient-specific 3D-printed external airway splints in three infants
   with severe TBM. At the time of publication, these infants no longer
   exhibited life-threatening airway disease and had demonstrated
   resolution of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications of their
   TBM. Long-term data show continued growth of the primary airways. This
   process has broad application for medical manufacturing of
   patient-specific 3D-printed devices that adjust to tissue growth through
   designed mechanical and degradation behaviors over time.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the response of materials to extreme conditions,
   there are several approaches to depositing extremely high concentrations
   of energy into very small volumes of material, including ultrafast laser
   and swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation. In this study,
   crystalline-to-crystalline phase transformations in cubic Gd2O3 and
   monoclinic ZrO2 have been investigated using ultrafast laser
   irradiation. The phases produced by the extreme conditions of
   irradiation were characterized by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction
   (GIXRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Gd2O3 exhibited a cubic-to-monoclinic
   phase transformation, as evidenced by the appearance of the monoclinic
   (40 (2) over bar), (003), (310), and (11 (2) over bar) peaks in the
   GIXRD pattern and of four A(g) and three B-g Raman modes. ZrO2 underwent
   a monoclinic-to-tetragonal phase transformation, as evidenced by the
   emergence of the tetragonal (101) peak in the GIXRD pattern and of E-g
   and A(1g) Raman modes. The new phases formed by ultrafast laser
   irradiation are high temperature polymorphs of the two materials. No
   evidence of amorphization was seen in the GIXRD data, though Raman
   spectroscopy indicated point defect accumulation. These results are
   identical to those produced by irradiation with SHIs, which also deposit
   energy in materials primarily through electronic excitation. The
   similarity in damage process and material response between ultrafast
   laser and SHI irradiation suggests a fundamental relationship between
   these two techniques. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{High-energy optical phonons are preferred in phonon-absorbing
   transitions, and regarding their production we analyze the phonon
   upconversion processes under nonequilibrium created by heterojunction
   transmission. For heterojunctions, steady phonon flux from a
   low-cutoff-frequency layer (e.g., Ge) is transmitted to a high cutoff
   layer (e.g., Si), creating a nonequilibrium population of low-energy
   phonons for upconversion. Using quantum spectral phonon transmission and
   first-principles calculations of the phonon interaction kinetics, we
   identify the high-conversion efficiency channels, i.e., modes and wave
   vectors. Junction-transmitted phonons, despite suffering from the
   interface reflection and from spreading interactions with equilibrium
   native phonons, have a high upconversion rate to Brillouin zone-boundary
   optical phonons, while nonequilibrium native phonons are efficiently
   upconverted over most of the zone. So, depending on the harvested
   optical phonon, one of these nonequilibrium phonons can be selected for
   an efficient upconversion rate.}},

   Chemotaxis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Chemokine gradient formation requires multiple processes that include
   ligand secretion and diffusion, receptor binding and internalization,
   and immobilization of ligand to surfaces. To understand how these events
   dynamically shape gradients and influence ensuing cell chemotaxis, we
   built a multi-scale hybrid agent-based model linking gradient formation,
   cell responses, and receptor-level information. The CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7
   signaling axis is highly implicated in metastasis of many cancers. We
   model CXCL12 gradient formation as it is impacted by CXCR4 and CXCR7,
   with particular focus on the three most highly expressed isoforms of
   CXCL12. We trained and validated our model using data from an in vitro
   microfluidic source-sink device. Our simulations demonstrate how isoform
   differences on the molecular level affect gradient formation and cell
   responses. We determine that ligand properties specific to CXCL12
   isoforms (binding to the migration surface and to CXCR4) significantly
   impact migration and explain differences in in vitro chemotaxis data. We
   extend our model to analyze CXCL12 gradient formation in a tumor
   environment and find that short distance, steep gradients characteristic
   of the CXCL12-gamma isoform are effective at driving chemotaxis. We
   highlight the importance of CXCL12-gamma in cancer cell migration: its
   high effective affinity for both extracellular surface sites and CXCR4
   strongly promote CXCR4+ cell migration. CXCL12-gamma is also more
   difficult to inhibit, and we predict that co-inhibition of CXCR4 and
   CXCR7 is necessary to effectively hinder CXCL12-gamma-induced migration.
   These findings support the growing importance of understanding
   differences in protein isoforms, and in particular their implications
   for cancer treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Optical measurements and first-principles calculations of the band
   structure and exciton states in direct-gap bulk and few-layer PbI2
   indicate that the n = 1 exciton is Frenkel-like in nature in that its
   energy exhibits a weak dependence on thickness down to atomic-length
   scales. Results reveal large increases in the gap and exciton binding
   energy with a decreasing number of layers and a transition of the
   fundamental gap, which becomes indirect for one and two monolayers.
   Calculated values are in reasonable agreement with a particle-in-a-box
   model relying on the Wannier-Mott theory of exciton formation. General
   arguments and existing data suggest that the Frenkel-like character of
   the lowest exciton is a universal feature of wide-gap layered
   semiconductors whose effective masses and dielectric constants give bulk
   Bohr radii that are on the order of the layer spacing.}},

Abstract = {{High performance active materials are of rapidly growing interest for
   applications including soft robotics; microfluidic systems, and morphing
   composites. In particular, paraffin wax has been used to actuate
   miniature pumps, solenoid valves, and composite fibers, yet its
   deployment is typically limited by the need for external volume
   constraint. We demonstrate that compact, high-performance paraffin
   actuators can be made by confining paraffin within vertically aligned
   carbon nanotube (CNT) films. This large-stroke vertical actuation is
   enabled by strong capillary interaction between paraffin and CNTs and by
   engineering the CNT morphology by mechanical compression before
   capillary-driven infiltration of the molten paraffin. The Maximum
   actuation Strain of the corrugated CNT-paraffin films (similar to
   0.02-0.2) is comparable to natural muscle, yet the maximum stress is
   limited to similar to 10 kPa by collapse of the CNT network. We also
   show how a CNT-paraffin film can serve as a self-activating thermal
   interface that closes a gap when it is heated. These new CNT-paraffin
   film actuators could be produced by large-area CNT growth, infiltration,
   and lamination methods, and are attractive for use in Miniature systems
   due to their self-contained design.}},

Title = {{Energetic-Energetic Cocrystals of Diacetone Diperoxide (DADP): Dramatic
   and Divergent Sensitivity Modifications via Cocrystallization}},

Abstract = {{Here we report a series of energeticenergetic cocrystals that
   incorporate the primary explosive diacetone diperoxide (DADP) with a
   series of trihalotrinitrobenzene explosives: 1:1
   DADP/1,3,5-trichloro-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TCTNB), 1:1
   DADP/1,3,5-tribromo-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TBTNB), and 1:1
   DADP/1,3,5-triiodo-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TITNB). Acetone peroxides are
   attractive for their inexpensive and facile synthesis, but undesirable
   properties such as poor stability, intractably high sensitivity and low
   density, an indicator for low explosive power, have limited their
   application. Here through cocrystallization the density, oxygen balance,
   and stability of DADP are dramatically improved. Regarding sensitivity,
   in the case of the DADP/TCTNB cocrystal, the high impact sensitivity of
   DADP is retained by the cocrystal, making it a denser and less volatile
   form of DADP that remains viable as a primary explosive. Conversely, the
   DADP/TITNB cocrystal features impact sensitivity that is greatly reduced
   relative to both pure DADP and pure TITNB, demonstrating for the first
   time an energetic cocrystal that is less sensitive to impact than either
   of its pure components. This dramatic difference in cocrystal
   sensitivities may stem from the significantly different halogenperoxide
   interactions seen in each cocrystal structure. These results highlight
   how sensitivity is defined by complex relationships between inherent
   bond strengths and solid-state properties, and cocrystal series such as
   that presented here provide a powerful experimental platform to probe
   this relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Although nigrostriatal changes are most commonly affiliated with
   Parkinson's disease, the role of the cerebellum in Parkinson's has
   become increasingly apparent. The present study used lobule-based
   cerebellar resting state functional connectivity to (1) compare
   cerebellar-whole brain and cerebellar-cerebellar connectivity in
   Parkinson's patients both ON and OFF L-DOPA medication and controls, and
   to (2) relate variations in cerebellar connectivity to behavioral
   performance. Results indicated that, when contrasted to the control
   group, Parkinson's patients OFF medication had increased levels of
   cerebellar-whole brain and cerebellar-cerebellar connectivity, whereas
   Parkinson's patients ON medication had decreased levels of
   cerebellar-whole brain and cerebellar-cerebellar connectivity. Moreover,
   analyses relating levels of cerebellar connectivity to behavioral
   measures demonstrated that, within each group, increased levels of
   connectivity were most often associated with improved cognitive and
   motor performance, but there were several instances where increased
   connectivity was related to poorer performance. Overall, the present
   study found medication-variant cerebellar connectivity in Parkinson's
   patients, further demonstrating cerebellar changes associated with
   Parkinson's disease and the moderating effects of medication.}},

Abstract = {{Compelling evidence shows that chemokine C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12
   (CXCL12) drives metastasis in multiple malignancies. Similar to other
   key cytokines in cancer, CXCL12 exists as several isoforms with distinct
   biophysical properties that may alter signaling and functional outputs.
   However, effects of CXCL12 isoforms in cancer remain unknown.
   CXCL12-alpha, -beta and -gamma showed cell-type-specific differences in
   activating signaling through G protein-dependent pathways in cell-based
   assays, while CXCL12-gamma had greatest effects on recruitment of the
   adapter protein beta-arrestin 2. CXCL12-beta and -gamma also stimulated
   endothelial tube formation to a greater extent than CXCL12-alpha. To
   investigate the effects of CXCL12 isoforms on tumor growth and
   metastasis, we used a mouse xenograft model of metastatic human breast
   cancer combining CXCR4+ breast cancer cells and mammary fibroblasts
   secreting an isoform of CXCL12. Altough all CXCL12 isoforms produced
   comparable growth of mammary tumors, CXCL12-gamma significantly
   increased metastasis to bone marrow and other sites. Breast cancer cells
   originating from tumors with CXCL12-gamma fibroblasts upregulated RANKL
   (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand), contributing to
   bone marrow tropism of metastatic cancer cells. CXCL12-gamma was
   expressed in metastatic tissues in mice, and we also detected
   CXCL12-gamma in malignant pleural effusions from patients with breast
   cancer. In our mouse model, mammary fibroblasts disseminated to sites of
   breast cancer metastases, providing another mechanism to increase levels
   of CXCL12 in metastatic environments. These studies identify
   CXCL12-gamma as a potent pro-metastatic molecule with important
   implications for cancer biology and effective therapeutic targeting of
   CXCL12 pathways.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and demonstrate a physical mechanism for producing liquid
   microjets by taking an optoacoustic approach that can convert light to
   sound through a carbon-nanotube-coated lens, where light from a pulsed
   laser is converted to high momentum sound wave. The carbon-nanotube lens
   can focus high-amplitude sound waves to a microspot of < 100 mu m near
   the air-water interface from the water side, leading to microbubbles in
   water and subsequent microjets into the air. Laser-flash shadowgraphy
   visualizes two consecutive jets closely correlated with bubble dynamics.
   Because of the acoustic scattering from the interface, negative pressure
   amplitudes are significantly increased up to 80 MPa, even allowing
   homogeneous bubble nucleation. As a demonstration, this nozzle-free
   approach is applied to inject colored liquid into a tissue-mimicking gel
   as well as print a material on a glass substrate.}},

Abstract = {{The discharge rate is critical to the performance of lithium/oxygen
   batteries: it impacts both cell capacity and discharge-phase morphology,
   and in so doing may also affect the efficiency of the oxygen-evolution
   reaction during recharging. First-discharge data from tens of Li/O-2
   cells discharged across four rates are analyzed statistically to inform
   these connections. In the practically significant superficial
   current-density range of 0.1 to 1 mA cm(-2), capacity is found to fall
   as a power law, with a Peukerts-law exponent of 1.6 +/- 0.1. X-ray
   diffractometry confirms the dominant presence of crystalline Li2O2 in
   the discharged electrodes. A completely air-free sample-transfer
   technique was developed to implement scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   of the discharge product. SEM imaging of electrodes with near-average
   capacities provides statistically significant measures of the shape and
   size variation of electrodeposited Li2O2 particles with respect to
   discharge current. At lower rates, typical toroidal particles are
   observed that are well approximated as cylindrical structures, whose
   average radii remain relatively constant as discharge rate increases,
   whereas their average heights decrease. At the highest rate studied,
   air-free SEM shows that particles take needle-like shapes rather than
   forming the nanosheets or compact films described elsewhere. Average
   particle volumes decrease with current while particle surface-to-volume
   ratios increase dramatically, supporting the notion that Li2O2 grows by
   a locally mass-transfer-limited nucleation and growth mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of an innovative biomedical diagnostic technique,
   thermal photo-acoustic (TPA) measurement, for non-ionizing and
   non-invasive assessment of bone health is investigated. Unlike
   conventional photo-acoustic PA methods that are mostly focused on the
   measurement of absolute signal intensity, TPA targets the change in PA
   signal intensity as a function of the sample temperature, i.e., the
   temperature-dependent Grueneisen parameter that is closely relevant to
   the chemical and molecular properties in the sample. Based on the
   differentiation measurement, the results from TPA technique are less
   susceptible to the variations associated with sample and system, and
   could be quantified with improved accurately. Due to the fact that the
   PA signal intensity from organic components such as blood changes faster
   than that from non-organic mineral under the same modulation of
   temperature, TPA measurement is able to objectively evaluate bone
   mineral density (BMD) and its loss as a result of osteoporosis. In an
   experiment on well-established rat models of bone loss and preservation,
   PA measurements of rat tibia bones were conducted over a temperature
   range from 37 degrees C to 44 degrees C. The slope of PA signal
   intensity verses temperature was quantified for each specimen. The
   comparison among three groups of specimens with different BMD shows that
   bones with lower BMD have higher slopes, demonstrating the potential of
   the proposed TPA technique in future clinical management of
   osteoporosis. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The reinforcing effect of steel fibers in asphalt concrete is
   investigated through indirect tension tests conducted at -20 degrees C.
   Control specimens with no fibers, and test series with carbon and
   polyvinyl alcohol fibers are also carried out for comparison. Cracking
   resistance, indirect tensile strength, fracture energy, and
   post-cracking energy are obtained from the tests. The effects of fiber
   diameter, length, deformed shape, and content of steel fibers are
   investigated in order to provide fundamental understanding of the
   reinforcing mechanisms mobilized during fiber pull out and select proper
   reinforcing fibers. The test results demonstrate that the low
   temperature cracking resistance of asphalt concrete can be significantly
   improved by adding the proper type and amount of steel fibers, but that
   the improvements in mechanical properties are sensitive to fiber length
   and diameter. The indirect tensile strength and toughness of fiber
   reinforced asphalt concrete increase with an increase in fiber length
   within the 0.2-0.4 mm diameter range. Mechanical deformations of the
   fibers, e.g. presence of a hook or twisting, can induce further
   improvements in post-cracking energy absorption. Compared to
   unreinforced specimens, fiber reinforced specimens show up to 62.5\%
   increase in indirect tensile strength, and up to 370\% and 895\%
   improvements in fracture energy and toughness, respectively. A
   hypothesis that explains the fiber reinforcing mechanism in asphalt
   concrete is proposed and critiqued based on the test data. (c) 2015

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{276-283}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHP-FRC) is a type of
   cementitious composite that has extended hardening and softening
   responses when subjected to tension. The length of the tensile loading
   regime complicates the development of test setups that can capture the
   full tensile response at high strain rates. To address this challenge,
   analytical and finite element modeling are used to propose modifications
   to an existing test set up to enable it to conduct accurate and
   practical testing of UHP-FRC specimens in direct tension, under high
   strain rate. The test device employs suddenly released strain energy to
   generate an impact pulse and a sufficiently long transmitter bar to
   channel the signal and measure it. Tests conducted on UHP-FRC specimens
   at strain rates of 90-145 1/s show that, under increasing strain rates,
   the material maintains its strain capacity and has highly enhanced
   strain dissipation capacity, making it particularly well suited for
   blast and impact applications. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The biotransformation of L-arabinitol into L-xylulose was investigated
   using whole-cell biocatalysts. Efficient production of L-xylulose was
   accomplished using Escherichia coli that expressed L-arabinitol

   with a cofactor-regenerating NADH oxidase in an E. coli whole-cell
   biocatalyst system. Factors affecting the production of L-xylulose by
   this whole-cell biocatalyst system include reaction pH, maximal cell
   loading, and cofactor regeneration. Under optimized conditions, the
   conversion of L-arabinitol into L-xylulose was achieved with above 96\%
   efficiency, a rate much higher than that reported in previous studies.
   Furthermore, the whole-cell system could be immobilized on calcium
   alginate; the immobilized cells showed good operational stability,
   retaining their relative productivity at 65\% after 7 cycles of

   The results reveal that the number of Frenkel pairs increases with the

   the formation of Cr precipitates in Fe-Cr alloys, as analyzed using
   short range order (SRO) parameters to quantify the degree of ordering
   and clustering of Cr atoms. In addition, the simulations using MMC
   approach show that the presence of small Cr clusters and vacancy
   clusters formed within cascade overlapped region enhance the nucleation
   of Cr precipitates, leading to the formation of large Cr dilute

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of ultrafine-grained aluminum produced by
   equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) are strongly influenced by strain
   rate. In this work, an experimental investigation of local strain rate
   sensitivity as it relates to microstructure was performed using a
   combination of scanning electron microscopy and digital image
   correlation. Uniaxial tension tests were carried out at 200 degrees C
   and strain rates alternating between 2.5 x 10(-5) s(-1) and 3.0 x 10(-3)
   s(-1). The results demonstrate that the heterogeneous microstructure
   generated by ECAP has a strong effect on the microstructure scale strain
   rate sensitivity. Deformation centered at grain boundaries separating
   regions of banded microstructure exhibits the greatest strain rate
   sensitivity. Strain rate sensitivity is limited in deformation occurring
   in regions of microstructure composed of ultrafine grains separated by
   low-angle grain boundaries. The tensile specimens all failed by shear
   bands at 200 degrees C and at room temperature they failed by necking
   with little plastic deformation apparent outside of the neck.}},

Abstract = {{Nanosized, carbon-coated LiFePO4 (LFP) is a promising cathode for Li-ion
   batteries. However, nano-particles are problematic for electrode design,
   optimized electrodes requiring high tap densities, good electronic
   wiring, and a low tortuosity for efficient Li diffusion in the
   electrolyte in between the solid particles, conditions that are
   difficult to achieve simultaneously. Using in situ energy-dispersive
   X-ray diffraction, we map the evolution of the inhomogeneous
   electrochemical reaction in LFP-electrodes. On the first cycle, the
   dynamics are limited by Li diffusion in the electrolyte at a cycle rate
   of C/7. On the second cycle, there appear to be two rate-limiting
   processes: Li diffusion in the electrolyte and electronic conductivity
   through the electrode. Three-dimensional modeling based on porous
   electrode theory shows that this change in dynamics can be reproduced by
   reducing the electronic conductivity of the composite electrode by a
   factor of 8 compared to the first cycle. The poorer electronic wiring
   could result from the expansion and contraction of the particles upon
   cycling and/or the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase layer. A
   lag was also observed perpendicular to the direction of the current: the
   LFP particles at the edges of the cathode reacted preferentially to
   those in the middle, owing to the closer proximity to the electrolyte
   source. Simulations show that, at low charge rates, the reaction becomes
   more uniformly distributed across the electrode as the porosity or the
   width of the particle-size distribution is increased. However, at higher
   rates, the reaction becomes less uniform and independent of the
   particle-size distribution.}},

Abstract = {{We show that the vitrification of star-shaped polystyrene (PS), of
   functionality f and molecular weight per arm M-w(arm), thin films
   supported by silicon oxide, SiOx, is strongly dependent on M-w(arm) and
   f. When f is small, the vitrification behavior is similar to that of
   linear-chain PS where the average glass transition, T-g, decreases with
   decreasing film thickness (Delta T-g < 0). However, for sufficiently
   large f and small M-w(arm), T-g becomes independent of film thickness
   (Delta T-g < 0). In this region, where Delta T-g approximate to 0, the
   star-shaped macromolecules self-assemble into ordered, periodic
   structures, similar to that of soft spheres or colloids, as revealed by
   simulations and experiments. This is identified as the soft-colloidal
   region. The transition from the linear-chain-like to the
   soft-colloidal-like region occurs over an intermediate range of
   functionalities and arm lengths; throughout this transition range Delta
   T-g > 0. We show that the overall vitrification behavior of these thin
   film star-shaped polymers is due to competing entropic interactions
   associated with changes in f and M-w(arm). The vitrification behavior of
   thin star-shaped PS films on SiOx is summarized in terms of a diagram of
   states.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate separation of air and bone is critical for creating synthetic
   CT from MRI to support Radiation Oncology workflow. This study compares
   two different ultrashort echo-time sequences in the separation of air
   from bone, and evaluates post-processing methods that correct intensity
   nonuniformity of images and account for intensity gradients at tissue
   boundaries to improve this discriminatory power. CT and MRI scans were
   acquired on 12 patients under an institution review board-approved
   prospective protocol. The two MRI sequences tested were ultra-short TE
   imaging using 3D radial acquisition (UTE), and using pointwise encoding
   time reduction with radial acquisition (PETRA). Gradient nonlinearity
   correction was applied to both MR image volumes after acquisition. MRI
   intensity nonuniformity was corrected by vendor-provided normalization
   methods, and then further corrected using the N4itk algorithm. To
   overcome the intensity-gradient at air-tissue boundaries, spatial
   dilations, from 0 to 4 mm, were applied to threshold-defined air regions
   from MR images. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, by
   comparing predicted (defined by MR images) versus `true' regions of air
   and bone (defined by CT images), were performed with and without
   residual bias field correction and local spatial expansion. The
   post-processing corrections increased the areas under the ROC curves
   (AUC) from 0.944 +/- 0.012 to 0.976 +/- 0.003 for UTE images, and from
   0.850 +/- 0.022 to 0.887 +/- 0.012 for PETRA images, compared to without
   corrections. When expanding the threshold-defined air volumes, as
   expected, sensitivity of air identification decreased with an increase
   in specificity of bone discrimination, but in a non-linear fashion. A 1
   mm air mask expansion yielded AUC increases of 1 and 4\% for UTE and
   PETRA images, respectively. UTE images had significantly greater
   discriminatory power in separating air from bone than PETRA images.
   Post-processing strategies improved the discriminatory power of air from
   bone for both UTE and PETRA images, and reduced the difference between
   the two imaging sequences. Both post-processed UTE and PETRA images
   demonstrated sufficient power to discriminate air from bone to support
   synthetic CT generation from MRI data.}},

Abstract = {{This article considers the treatment plan optimization problem for
   Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) with constant gantry speed and
   dose rate (VMATc). In particular, we consider the simultaneous
   optimization of multileaf collimator leaf positions and a constant
   gantry speed and dose rate. We propose a heuristic framework for
   (approximately) solving this optimization problem that is based on
   hierarchical decomposition. Specifically, an iterative algorithm is used
   to heuristically optimize dose rate and gantry speed selection, where at
   every iteration a leaf position optimization subproblem is solved, also
   heuristically, to find a high-quality plan corresponding to a given dose
   rate and gantry speed. We apply our framework to clinical patient cases,
   and compare the resulting VMATc plans to idealized IMRT, as well as full
   VMAT plans. Our results suggest that VMATc is capable of producing
   treatment plans of comparable quality to VMAT, albeit at the expense of
   long computation time and generally higher total monitor units.}},

Abstract = {{Scintillator radiation detectors suffer from low energy resolution that
   has been attributed to nonlinear light yield response to the energy of
   the incident gamma rays. Auger recombination is a key non-radiative
   recombination channel that scales with the third power of the excitation
   density and may play a role in the non-proportionality problem of
   scintillators. In this work, we study direct and phonon-assisted Auger
   recombination in NaI using first-principles calculations. Our results
   show that phonon-assisted Auger recombination, mediated primarily by
   short-range phonon scattering, dominates at room temperature. We discuss
   our findings in light of the much larger values obtained by numerical
   fits to z-scan experiments. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The past two decades have witnessed the emergence and rapid growth of
   the research field of nanoscale thermal transport. Much of the work in
   this field has been fundamental studies that have explored the
   mechanisms of heat transport in nanoscale films, wires, particles,
   interfaces, and channels. However, in recent years there has been an
   increasing emphasis on utilizing the fundamental knowledge gained toward
   understanding and improving device and system performances. In this
   opinion article, an attempt is made to provide an evaluation of the
   existing and potential impacts of the basic research efforts in this
   field on the developments of the heat transfer discipline, workforce,
   and a number of technologies, including heat-assisted magnetic
   recording, phase change memories, thermal management of
   microelectronics, thermoelectric energy conversion, thermal energy
   storage, building and vehicle heating and cooling, manufacturing, and
   biomedical devices. The goal is to identify successful examples,
   significant challenges, and potential opportunities where thermal
   science research in nanoscale has been or will be a game changer.}},

Abstract = {{We calculate the conduction-band structures and n-type thermoelectric
   transport properties for the TiO2 polymorphs rutile, anatase, and
   brookite from first principles within the constant-relaxation-time
   approximation. Although the Seebeck coefficient is nearly isotropic in
   all polymorphs, the power factor is anisotropic and takes its largest
   values along {[}100] in rutile and anatase and along {[}010] in
   brookite. We also identify the free-carrier concentrations and
   temperatures that maximize the power factor. Our results for the
   theoretical upper bounds of the figure of merit at high temperature show
   that optimized rutile exhibits thermoelectric conversion efficiency that
   is superior to anatase and brookite and can reach values desirable for
   waste-heat recovery applications.}},

Title = {{Robust decision making over a set of random targets or risk-averse
   utilities with an application to portfolio optimization}},
Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{358-372}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{In many situations, decision-makers need to exceed a random target or
   make decisions using expected utilities. These two situations are
   equivalent when a decision-maker's utility function is increasing and
   bounded. This article focuses on the problem where the random target has
   a concave cumulative distribution function (cdf) or a risk-averse
   decision-maker's utility is concave (alternatively, the probability
   density function (pdf) of the random target or the decision-maker'
   marginal utility is decreasing) and the concave cdf or utility can only
   be specified by an uncertainty set. Specifically, a robust (maximin)
   framework is studied to facilitate decision making in such situations.
   Functional bounds on the random target's cdf and pdf are used.
   Additional general auxiliary requirements may also be used to describe
   the uncertainty set. It is shown that a discretized version of the
   problem may be formulated as a linear program. A result showing the
   convergence of discretized models for uncertainty sets specified using
   continuous functions is also proved. A portfolio investment decision
   problem is used to illustrate the construction and usefulness of the
   proposed decision-making framework.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores the possibility of using camber actuation as ameans
   for reducing vibration and improving performance in a rotor in the
   presence of dynamic stall. For the analysis of a rotor bladewith camber
   actuation in forward flight conditions, a modified version of the ONERA
   dynamic stall model was included in the analysis code UM/NLABS-A
   (University of Michigan, Nonlinear Asymptotic Beam Solver coupled with
   Aerodynamics). In the optimization, the amplitude and phase of camber
   actuation at 2/rev, 3/rev, 4/rev, and 5/rev actuation frequencies were
   used as the design variables and the analysis was performed with both
   cubic and quadratic camber deformation shape functions. The optimization
   studies were performed using surrogate models in combination with the
   efficient global optimization algorithm. Using the scaled BO105 rotor as
   the baseline model, optimization results obtained showed 50\% reduction
   in 4/rev vibratory loads at the hub and more than 3.5\% improvement in
   the performance using camber actuation at an advance ratio of 0.33.}},

   increase antigen uptake by antigen-presenting cells, leading to new
   vaccine formulations optimized for induction of antigen-specific CD8+ T
   cell responses. In this article, we describe the synthesis of a
   ``pathogen-mimicking{''} nanoparticle system, termed
   interbilayer-crosslinked multilamellar vesicles (ICMVs) that can serve
   as an effective vaccine carrier for co-delivery of subunit antigens and
   immunostimulatory agents and elicitation of potent cytotoxic CD8+ T
   lymphocyte (CTL) responses. We describe methods for characterizing
   hydrodynamic size and surface charge of vaccine nanoparticles with
   dynamic light scattering and zeta potential analyzer and present a
   confocal microscopy-based procedure to analyze nanoparticle-mediated
   antigen delivery to draining lymph nodes. Furthermore, we show a new
   bioluminescence whole-animal imaging technique utilizing adoptive
   transfer of luciferase-expressing, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells into
   recipient mice, followed by nanoparticle vaccination, which permits
   non-invasive interrogation of expansion and trafficking patterns of CTLs
   in real time. We also describe tetramer staining and flow cytometric
   analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells for longitudinal
   quantification of endogenous T cell responses in mice vaccinated with
   nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an obstacle avoidance method for spacecraft relative
   motion control. In this approach, a connectivity graph is constructed
   for a set of relative frame points, which form a virtual net centered
   around a nominal orbital position. The connectivity between points in
   the virtual net is determined based on the use of safe positively
   invariant sets for guaranteed collision free maneuvering. A graph search
   algorithm is then applied to find a maneuver that avoids specified
   obstacles and adheres to specified thrust limits. As compared to
   conventional open-loop trajectory optimization, this approach enables
   the handling of bounded disturbances, which can represent the effects of
   perturbing forces and model uncertainty, while rigorously guaranteeing
   that nonconvex and possibly time-varying obstacle avoidance constraints
   are satisfied. Details for handling a single stationary obstacle,
   multiple stationary obstacles, moving obstacles, and bounded
   disturbances are reported and illustrated with simulation case studies.}},

Abstract = {{A supercritical (SC) nitrogen (N-2) switch is designed and tested. The
   dielectric strength and recovery rate of the SC switch are investigated
   by experiments. In order to theoretically study the discharge and
   recovery process of the SC N-2 switch under high repetition rate
   operation, a numerical model is developed. For SC N-2 with initial
   parameters of p = 80.9 bar and T = 300 K, the simulation results show
   that within several nanoseconds after the streamer bridges the switch
   gap, the spark is fully developed and this time depends on the applied
   electric field between electrodes. During the whole discharge process,
   the maximum temperature in the channel is about 20 000 K. About 10 mu s
   after the spark excitation of 200 ns duration, the temperature on the
   axis decays to T-axis <= 1500 K, mainly contributed by the gas expansion
   and heat transfer mechanisms. After 100 mu s, the dielectric strength of
   the gap recovers to above half of the cold breakdown voltage due to the
   temperature decay in the channel. Both experimental and numerical
   investigations indicate that supercritical fluid is a good insulating
   medium that has a proved high breakdown voltage and fast recovery speed.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Image denoising is a fundamental operation in image processing, and its
   applications range from the direct (photographic enhancement) to the
   technical (as a subproblem in image reconstruction algorithms). In many
   applications, the number of pixels has continued to grow, while the
   serial execution speed of computational hardware has begun to stall. New
   image processing algorithms must exploit the power offered by massively
   parallel architectures like graphics processing units (GPUs). This paper
   describes a family of image denoising algorithms well-suited to the GPU.
   The algorithms iteratively perform a set of independent, parallel 1D
   pixel-update subproblems. To match GPU memory limitations, they perform
   these pixel updates in-place and only store the noisy data, denoised
   image, and problem parameters. The algorithms can handle a wide range of
   edge-preserving roughness penalties, including differentiable convex
   penalties and anisotropic total variation. Both algorithms use the
   majorize-minimize framework to solve the 1D pixel update subproblem.
   Results from a large 2D image denoising problem and a 3D medical imaging
   denoising problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithms converge
   rapidly in terms of both iteration and run-time.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the buckling of a single strip of material, modeled
   as a two-dimensional (2D) micropolar solid. The effects of material
   microstructure are incorporated by modeling the material using
   micropolar theory. By setting the micropolar constants to zero, the
   equations of classical elasticity are obtained and these results are
   compared to the buckling analysis performed by previous authors on
   elastic materials. In the limiting case, when the thickness of the strip
   becomes small in comparison to the overall length, the micropolar beam
   equations are developed. Because buckling analysis requires the
   consideration of geometric nonlinearity, nonlinear micropolar equations
   are derived using a variational procedure, which also results in
   variationally consistent boundary conditions. Due to the complexity of
   micropolar theory, its application has been limited to linear analysis

Abstract = {{For construction safety and health, continuous monitoring of unsafe
   conditions and action is essential in order to eliminate potential
   hazards in a timely manner. As a robust and automated means of field
   observation, computer vision techniques have been applied for the
   extraction of safety related information from site images and videos,
   and regarded as effective solutions complementary to current
   time-consuming and unreliable manual observational practices. Although
   some research efforts have been directed toward computer vision-based
   safety and health monitoring, its application in real practice remains
   premature due to a number of technical issues and research challenges in
   terms of reliability, accuracy, and applicability. This paper thus
   reviews previous attempts in construction applications from both
   technical and practical perspectives in order to understand the current
   status of computer vision techniques, which in turn suggests the
   direction of future research in the field of computer vision-based
   safety and health monitoring. Specifically, this paper categorizes
   previous studies into three groups-object detection, object tracking,
   and action recognition-based on types of information required to
   evaluate unsafe conditions and acts. The results demonstrate that major
   research challenges include comprehensive scene understanding, varying
   tracking accuracy by camera position, and action recognition of multiple
   equipment and workers. In addition, we identified several practical
   issues including a lack of task-specific and quantifiable metrics to
   evaluate the extracted information in safety context, technical
   obstacles due to dynamic conditions at construction sites and privacy
   issues. These challenges indicate a need for further research in these
   areas. Accordingly, this paper provides researchers insights into
   advancing knowledge and techniques for computer vision-based safety and
   health monitoring, and offers fresh opportunities and considerations to
   practitioners in understanding and adopting the techniques. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In Civil Infrastructure System (CIS) applications, the requirement of
   blending synthetic and physical objects distinguishes Augmented Reality
   (AR) from other visualization technologies in three aspects: (1) it
   reinforces the connections between people and objects, and promotes
   engineers appreciation about their working context; (2) it allows
   engineers to perform field tasks with the awareness of both the physical
   and synthetic environment; and (3) it offsets the significant cost of 3D
   Model Engineering by including the real world background. This paper
   reviews critical problems in AR and investigates technical approaches to
   address the fundamental challenges that prevent the technology from
   being usefully deployed in CIS applications, such as the alignment of
   virtual objects with the real environment continuously across time and
   space; blending of virtual entities with their real background
   faithfully to create a sustained illusion of co-existence; and the
   integration of these methods to a scalable and extensible computing AR
   framework that is openly accessible to the teaching and research
   community. The research findings have been evaluated in several
   challenging CIS applications where the potential of having a significant
   economic and social impact is high. Examples of validation test beds
   implemented include an AR visual excavator-utility collision avoidance
   system that enables workers to ``see{''} buried utilities hidden under
   the ground surface, thus helping prevent accidental utility strikes; an
   AR post-disaster reconnaissance framework that enables building
   inspectors to rapidly evaluate and quantify structural damage sustained
   by buildings in seismic events such as earthquakes or blasts; and a
   tabletop collaborative AR visualization framework that allows multiple
   users to observe and interact with visual simulations of engineering
   processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A general framework is presented for the formulation of steady-state
   simulation algorithms for magnetically nonlinear eddy-current problems
   using implicit Runge-Kutta (RK) methods. A close analogy is drawn
   between equations discretized using the backward-Euler method and fully
   implicit RK methods. Detailed formulations of the time-periodic
   finite-element method (TPFEM) and the shooting-Newton method (SNM) are
   derived using the popular family of diagonally implicit RK (DIRK)
   methods. Both algorithms employ the generalized minimum residual method
   to solve the linear equations arising at each Newton iteration. The
   benefits of higher-order DIRK methods are demonstrated by simulating a
   surface mount permanent magnet synchronous machine. The effects of using
   a solid versus a laminated rotor back iron on the simulation time are
   examined. Simulation results indicate that the performance of TPFEM and
   SNM is quite similar and much faster than transient analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Vibrotactile feedback (VTF) has been shown to improve balance
   performance in healthy people and people with vestibular disorders in a
   single-task experimental condition. It is unclear how age-related
   changes in balance affect the ability to use VTF and if there are
   different attentional requirements for old and young adults when using
   VTF. Twenty younger and 20 older subjects participated in this two-visit
   study to examine the effect of age, VTF, sensory condition, cognitive
   task, duration of time, and visit on postural and cognitive performance.
   Postural performance outcome measures included root mean square of
   center of pressure (COP) and trunk tilt, and cognitive performance was
   assessed using the reaction time (RT) from an auditory choice RT task.
   The results showed that compared with younger adults, older adults had
   an increase in COP in fixed platform conditions when using VTF, although
   they were able to reduce COP during sway-referenced platform conditions.
   Older adults also did not benefit fully from using VTF in their first
   session. The RTs for the secondary cognitive tasks increased
   significantly while using the VTF in both younger and older adults.
   Older adults had a larger increase compared with younger adults,
   suggesting that greater attentional demands were required in older
   adults when using VTF information. Future training protocols for VTF
   should take into consideration the effect of aging.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Precise monitoring of the rapidly changing immune status during the
   course of a disease requires multiplex analysis of cytokines from
   frequently sampled human blood. However, the current lack of rapid,
   multiplex, and low volume assays makes immune monitoring for clinical
   decision-making (e.g., critically ill patients) impractical. Without
   such assays, immune monitoring is even virtually impossible for infants
   and neonates with infectious diseases and/or immune mediated disorders
   as access to their blood in large quantities is prohibited. Localized
   surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-based microfluidic optical biosensing
   is a promising to fill this technical gap as it could potentially permit
   real-time refractometric detection of biomolecular binding on a metallic
   nanoparticle surface and sensor miniaturization, both leading to rapid
   and sample-sparing analyte analysis. Despite this promise, practical
   implementation of such a microfluidic assay for cytokine biomarker
   detection in serum samples has not been established primarily due to the
   limited sensitivity of LSPR biosensing. Here, we developed a
   high-throughput, label-free, multiarrayed OR optical biosensor device
   with 480 nanoplasmonic sensing spots in microfluidic channel arrays and
   demonstrated parallel multiplex immunoassays of six cytokines in a
   complex serum matrix on a single device chip while overcoming technical
   limitations. The device was fabricated using easy-to-implement, one-step
   microfluidic patterning and antibody conjugation of gold nanorods
   (AuNRs). When scanning the scattering light intensity across the
   microarrays of AuNR ensembles with dark-field imaging optics, our LSPR
   biosensing technique allowed for high-sensitivity quantitative cytokine
   measurements at concentrations down to 5-20 pg/mL from a 1 mu L serum
   sample. Using the nanoplasmonic biosensor microarray device, we
   demonstrated the ability to monitor the inflammatory responses of
   infants following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery through tracking
   the time-course variations of their serum cytokines. The whole parallel
   on-chip assays, which involved the loading, incubation, and washing of
   samples and reagents, and 10-fold replicated multianalyte detection for
   each sample using the entire biosensor arrays, were completed within 40
   min.}},

Abstract = {{Individually, alloying and ion irradiation are two avenues for modifying
   the chemical and phase structure at solid-state interfaces. Both can
   lead to the phenomena of alloying, intermixing, and, when combined,
   radiation-induced elemental redistribution. Thus, understanding how each
   independently influences the structure of interfaces provides insight
   into the chemical morphologies at the interface, the possible formation
   of secondary phases, and the basic mechanisms necessary for
   understanding alloying. Within the analytical framework provided by
   electron microscopy, we study changes in structure and chemistry in
   connection with the formation of composite layered interfaces following
   alloying and ion irradiation at metal-oxide interfaces. In particular,
   the chemical evolutions of as-deposited Fe/Cr and irradiated Fe thin
   films on TiO2 are characterized to reveal structural and chemical
   changes associated with physical interactions induced by either alloying
   or irradiation. The results of the study conclude by comparing the
   effects of alloying with radiation-induced intermixing. We find that the
   extent of Fe intermixing into the TiO2 substrate is similar for both
   irradiated and alloyed films, indicating that both can lead to the
   formation of similar complex nanoscale morphologies at the interface.
   Our results highlight the complex and competing phenomena that dictate
   the structure and chemistry at these interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{We show that metallic wires embedded in narrow waveguide bends and
   channels demonstrate resonance behavior at specific frequencies. The
   electromagnetic energy at these resonances tunnels through the narrow
   waveguide channels with almost no propagation losses. Under the
   tunneling behavior, high-intensity electromagnetic fields are produced
   in the vicinity of the metallic wires. These intense field resonances
   can be exploited to build highly sensitive dielectric sensors. The
   sensor operation is explained with the help of full-wave simulations. A
   practical setup consisting of a 3D waveguide bend is presented to
   experimentally observe the tunneling phenomenon. The tunneling frequency
   is predicted by determining the input impedance minima through a
   variational formula based on the Green function of a probe-excited
   parallel plate waveguide.}},

Abstract = {{Methanotrophs can express a cytoplasmic (soluble) methane monooxygenase
   (sMMO) or membrane-bound (particulate) methane monooxygenase (pMMO).
   Expression of these MMOs is strongly regulated by the availability of
   copper. Many methanotrophs have been found to synthesize a novel
   compound, methanobactin (Mb), that is responsible for the uptake of
   copper, and methanobactin produced by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b
   plays a key role in controlling expression of MMO genes in this strain.
   As all known forms of methanobactin are structurally similar, it was
   hypothesized that methanobactin from one methanotroph may alter gene
   expression in another. When Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b was grown in
   the presence of 1 mu M CuCl2, expression of mmoX, encoding a subunit of
   the hydroxylase component of sMMO, was very low. mmoX expression
   increased, however, when methanobactin from Methylocystis sp. strain SB2
   (SB2-Mb) was added, as did whole-cell sMMO activity, but there was no
   significant change in the amount of copper associated with Methylosinus
   trichosporium OB3b. If Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b was grown in the
   absence of CuCl2, the mmoX expression level was high but decreased by
   several orders of magnitude if copper prebound to SB2-Mb (Cu-SB2-Mb) was
   added, and biomass-associated copper was increased. Exposure of
   Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b to SB2-Mb had no effect on expression of
   mbnA, encoding the polypeptide precursor of methanobactin in either the
   presence or absence of CuCl2. mbnA expression, however, was reduced when
   Cu-SB2-Mb was added in both the absence and presence of CuCl2. These
   data suggest that methanobactin acts as a general signaling molecule in
   methanotrophs and that methanobactin ``piracy{''} may be commonplace.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional Unsteady Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes equations with
   the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model are used to simulate the flow
   induced motions of multiple circular cylinders with passive turbulence
   control (PTC) in steady uniform flow. Four configurations with 1, 2, 3,
   and 4 cylinders in tandem are simulated and studied at a series of
   Reynolds numbers in the range of 30 000 < Re < 120 000. Simulation
   results are verified by experimental data measured in the Marine
   Renewable Energy Laboratory. Good agreement was observed between the
   values of vorticity, amplitude ratio, and frequency ratio predicted by
   numerical simulations and experimental measurements. The amplitude and
   frequency response show the initial and upper branches in vortex induced
   vibration (VIV), transition from VIV to galloping, and galloping branch
   for all PTC-cylinders. The maximum amplitude of 2.9 diameters for the
   first cylinder is achieved at Re=104 356 in the numerical results.
   Compared with the first cylinder, the VIV initial branch starts at
   higher Re for the downstream cylinders due to the presence of the
   upstream cylinder(s). 2P and 2P+2S vortex patterns are observed at Re=62
   049 and Re=90 254 for the single PTC-cylinder. Furthermore, the shed
   vortices of the downstream cylinders are strongly disrupted and modified
   by the vortices shed from the upstream one in the cases of multiple
   PTC-cylinders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Instability modes in the form of axially uniform vertical jets, also
   called ``elevator modes,{''} are known to be the solutions of thermal
   convection problems for vertically unbounded systems. Typically, their
   relevance to the actual flow state is limited by three-dimensional
   breakdown caused by rapid growth of secondary instabilities. We consider
   a flow of a liquid metal in a vertical duct with a heated wall and
   strong transverse magnetic field and find elevator modes that are stable
   and, thus, not just relevant, but a dominant feature of the flow. We
   then explore the hypothesis suggested by recent experimental data that
   an analogous instability to modes of slow axial variation develops in
   finite-length ducts, where it causes large-amplitude fluctuations of
   temperature. The implications for liquid metal blankets for tokamak
   fusion reactors that potentially invalidate some of the currently
   pursued design concepts are discussed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The decarboxylation of antimicrobial aromatic acids such as
   phenylacrylic acid (cinnamic acid) and ferulic acid by yeast requires
   two enzymes described as phenylacrylic acid decarboxylase (PAD1) and
   ferulic acid decarboxylase (FDC). These enzymes are of interest for
   various biotechnological applications, such as the production of
   chemical feedstocks from lignin under mild conditions. However, the
   specific role of each protein in catalyzing the decarboxylation reaction
   remains unknown. To examine this, we have overexpressed and purified
   both PAD1 and FDC from E. coli. We demonstrate that PAD1 is a flavin
   mononucleotide (FMN)-containing protein. However, it does not function
   as a decarboxylase. Rather, PAD1 catalyzes the formation of a novel,
   diffusible cofactor required by FDC for decarboxylase activity.
   Coexpression of FDC and PAD1 results in the production of FDC with high
   levels cofactor bound. Holo-FDC catalyzes the decarboxylation of
   phenylacrylic acid, coumaric acid and ferulic acid with apparent kcat
   ranging from 1.44.6 s(-1). The UV-visible and mass spectra of the
   cofactor indicate that it appears to be a novel, modified form of
   reduced FMN; however, its instability precluded determination of its
   structure. The E. coli enzymes UbiX and UbiD are related by sequence to
   PAD1 and FDC respectively and are involved in the decarboxylation of
   4-hydroxy-3-octaprenylbenzoic acid, an intermediate in ubiquinone
   biosynthesis. We found that endogenous UbiX can also activate FDC. This
   implies that the same cofactor is required for decarboxylation of
   4-hydroxy-3-polyprenylbenzoic acid by UbiD and suggests a wider role for
   this cofactor in metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of different n-alkane precipitants on the kinetics of
   asphaltene aggregation is investigated in this study. When the chain
   length of the n-alkane precipitant, i.e., the carbon number, is
   increased, both the viscosity and solubility parameter of the solution
   increase and, as a result, the aggregation rate is expected to decrease.
   However, the actual behavior of the system is more subtle, and the
   aggregation rate can remain constant, increase, or pass through a
   maximum as the carbon number, n, increases. This behavior can be
   explained by the polydispersity of asphaltenes and the weaker
   precipitating power of longer chain n-alkanes. The polidispersity of
   asphaltenes is successfully characterized using their solubility
   parameter and the model developed in our previous study (Haji-Akbari,
   N., Masirisuk, P., Hoepfner, M. P., and Fogler, H. S. Energy Fuels 2013,
   27, 2497-2505), where a universal relationship between the detection
   time and the differences in solubility parameters was established. The
   solubility parameter of the precipitated asphaltenes is shown to
   increase with increasing the chain length of the n-alkane precipitants
   and is successfully used to predict the aggregation rate of asphaltenes
   in blends of up to five different n-alkane precipitants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on an integrated navigation algorithm for the visual
   simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) robotic area coverage
   problem. In the robotic area coverage problem, the goal is to explore
   and map a given target area within a reasonable amount of time. This
   goal necessitates the use of minimally redundant overlap trajectories
   for coverage efficiency; however, visual SLAM's navigation estimate will
   inevitably drift over time in the absence of loop closures. Therefore,
   efficient area coverage and good SLAM navigation performance represent
   competing objectives. To solve this decision-making problem, we
   introduce perception-driven navigation, an integrated navigation
   algorithm that automatically balances between exploration and
   revisitation using a reward framework. This framework accounts for SLAM
   localization uncertainty, area coverage performance, and the
   identification of good candidate regions in the environment for visual
   perception. Results are shown for both a hybrid simulation and
   real-world demonstration of a visual SLAM system for autonomous
   underwater ship hull inspection.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional production- and consumption-based accounting frameworks for
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions focus on the two ends of supply chains,
   treating intermediate sectors as a black box. Particular intermediate
   sectors can potentially be important for global mitigation of CO2
   emissions, through improving productivity to reduce inputs from upstream
   suppliers, thus emissions from upstream sectors, while still fulfilling
   downstream demands. Identifying those important intermediate sectors
   requires opening the black box and treating the economy as an integrated
   system. This study constructs a global virtual carbon network for 2009
   and identifies key sectors for reducing global CO2 emissions through
   improving productivity using network analysis techniques. We also
   identify 73 communities in the network in which sectors are more closely
   connected with one another than with sectors outside the community.
   Identifying communities helps in the understanding of potential impacts
   of sector-specific policy interventions through supply chains. The
   results offer additional insights that are not obviously visible in
   traditional input-output analysis.}},

   microvibratory actuation and sensing platform to provide on-chip
   physical stimulus for in situ calibration of long-term scale factor
   drifts in multiaxis microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial

   stage that can provide piezoelectric actuation for X/Y-tilting reference
   stimuli, compensation of undesired off-axis motion, integrated sensing
   of applied periodic stimulus, and electrostatic position lock-down for
   shock protection. A dual-axis MEMS gyroscope is mounted on top of the
   microplatform, and its electrical interconnects are provided through
   microfabricated highly flexible parylene cables with virtually
   zero-loading. The piezoelectric stage is measured to provide up to 280
   degrees/s angular ac excitation to a 25-mg inertial sensor payload at an
   expense of <100 mu W, while providing an analog sensing signal (11
   mV/degrees/s) to determine the applied rate with a precision of 1.2
   degrees/s. The estimated scale factor has < 0.8\% deviation from
   rate-table characterized values on the same-model gyroscope samples.
   With further improvements in control precision and angular velocity
   estimation, the introduced platform is expected enable on-chip

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new dual polarized antenna structure with matching
   and radiation characteristics suitable for radar and base-station
   applications. Two slightly different designs based on a dual polarized
   radiating element are presented. For radar applications, the radiating
   element is used to excite the two degenerate modes of a cavity with
   square cross-section. The resulting overall antenna size is 0.5
   lambda(m) x 0.5 lambda(m) x 0.2 lambda(m), where lambda(m) is the free
   space wavelength at the minimum operating frequency. The measured
   results showed isolation better than 30 dB and voltage standing wave
   ratio (VSWR) less than 2.5 over 1-1.95 GHz as well as good radiation
   pattern performance. For base-station applications, the exciting element
   was placed in front of a metallic ground plane to increase the
   beamwidth. This results in a smaller antenna size (0.38 lambda(m) x 0.38
   lambda(m) x 0.25 lambda(m)) at the expense of reduced directivity. The
   antenna is designed to work over 1710-2170 MHz which covers three common
   frequency bands of mobile radio application. The measured results showed
   return loss better than 14 dB over the operating band and more than 30
   dB polarization isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a cellular structure concept based on fluidic flexible matrix
   composites ((FMCs)-M-2) was investigated for its potential of
   concurrently achieving multiple adaptive functions. Such structure
   consists of two fluidically connected (FMC)-M-2 cells, and it has been
   proven capable of dynamic actuation with enhanced authority, variable
   stiffness, and vibration absorption. The purpose of the research
   presented in this paper is to develop comprehensive design and synthesis
   tools to exploit the rich functionality and versatility of this
   (FMC)-M-2 based system. To achieve this goal, two progressive research
   topics are addressed: The first is to survey unique architectures based
   on rigorous mathematical principles. Four generic types of architectures
   are identified for the dual-cellular structure based on fluidic and
   mechanical constraints between the two cells. The system governing
   equations of motion are derived and experimentally tested for these
   architectures, and it is found that the overall structural dynamics are
   related to the (FMC)-M-2 cell stiffness, internal pressure difference,
   and static flow volume between the two cells according to the
   architectural layout. The second research topic is to derive a
   comprehensive synthesis procedure to assign the (FMC)-M-2 designs so
   that the cellular structure can simultaneously reach a set of different
   performance targets. Synthesis case studies demonstrate the range of
   performance of the (FMC)-M-2 based cellular structure with respect to
   different architectures. The outcome of this investigation could provide
   valuable insights and design methodologies to foster the adoption of
   (FMC)-M-2 to advance the state of art of a variety of engineering
   applications. It also lays the foundation for a large-scale
   ``metastructure,{''} where many pairs of fluidically connected (FMC)-M-2
   can be employed as modules to achieve synergetic global performance.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{88-94}},

Abstract = {{This article reports experiments where lipid-extracted algal hydrochar
   (LEH) was gasified in supercritical water to recover energy (in the form
   of fuel gases) for use within a biorefinery and to recycle nitrogen (in
   the form of ammonium) for algae growth. Supercritical water gasification
   (SCWG) of LEH at 450-600 degrees C produced H-2, CO2, CH4, CO, C2H4, and
   C2H6, and converted the organic-bound nitrogen in the LEH into ammonium
   in the aqueous phase. Increased gasification severity increases the
   energy and nitrogen recovery. An energy recovery of 75\% and complete
   nitrogen recovery as ammonium were achieved after SCWG at 600 degrees C
   and 6 h. These findings demonstrate for the first time the conversion of
   the byproduct LEH to materials that can be used within an algal
   biorefinery. Recovering energy and nutrients in this manner may improve
   the environmental and economic sustainability of making nutraceuticals
   and biodiesel from microalgal lipids via an approach that uses
   hydrothermal carbonization of the biomass followed by solvent extraction
   of the lipids from the hydrochar. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A comparison between three chemistry models used for the

   shields in atmospheric air is presented. The differences between the
   models, as well as the results they produced for the boundary-layer

   put forward. A new model, built by optimizing and reducing a baseline
   model constructed using kinetic rates from a combustion database, is
   presented. Some of the important reactions, such as the CN/CO exchange,
   are highlighted, and their effects on surface heating are discussed. The
   resulting model comprises an extensive set of reactions that are
   relevant to carbon-phenolic ablators in high-enthalpy re-entry
   environments. The analysis presented in this paper shows that this model
   preserves the important features of the three existing chemistry models

Abstract = {{Preparation of functional shape memory polymer (SMP) for tissue
   engineering remains a challenge. Here the synthesis of strong
   electroactive shape memory polymer (ESMP) networks based on star-shaped
   polylactide (PLA) and aniline trimer (AT) is reported. Six-armed PLAs
   with various chain lengths were chemically cross-linked to synthesize
   SMP. After addition of an electroactive AT segment into the SMP, ESMP
   was obtained. The polymers were characterized by (1)H NMR, GPC, FT-IR,
   CV, DSC, DMA, tensile test, and degradation test. The SMP and ESMP
   exhibited strong mechanical properties (modulus higher than GPa) and
   excellent shape memory performance: short recovery time (several
   seconds), high recovery ratio (over 94\%), and high fixity ratio (almost
   100\%). Moreover, cyclic voltammetry test confirmed the electroactivity
   of the ESMP. The ESMP significantly enhanced the proliferation of C2C12
   cells compared to SMP and linear PLA (control). In addition, the ESMP
   greatly improved the osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells
   compared to PH10 and PLA in terms of ALP enzyme activity,
   immunofluorescence staining, and relative gene expression by
   quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). These
   intelligent SMPs and electroactive SMP with strong mechanical
   properties, tunable degradability, good electroactivity,
   biocompatibility, and enhanced osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells
   show great potential for bone regeneration.}},

Title = {{Temporal variation of traffic on highways and the development of
   accurate temporal allocation factors for air pollution analyses}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},

Abstract = {{Traffic activity encompasses the number, mix, speed and acceleration of
   vehicles on roadways. The temporal pattern and variation of traffic
   activity reflects vehicle use, congestion and safety issues, and it
   represents a major influence on emissions and concentrations of
   traffic-related air pollutants. Accurate characterization of vehicle
   flows is critical in analyzing and modeling urban and local-scale
   pollutants, especially in near-road environments and traffic corridors.
   This study describes methods to improve the characterization of temporal
   variation of traffic activity. Annual, monthly, daily and hourly
   temporal allocation factors (TAFs), which describe the expected temporal
   variation in traffic activity, were developed using four years of hourly
   traffic activity data recorded at 14 continuous counting stations across
   the Detroit, Michigan, U.S. region. Five sites also provided vehicle
   classification. TAF-based models provide a simple means to apportion
   annual average estimates of traffic volume to hourly estimates. The
   analysis shows the need to separate TAFs for total and commercial
   vehicles, and weekdays, Saturdays, Sundays and observed holidays. Using
   either site-specific or urban-wide TAFs, nearly all of the variation in
   historical traffic activity at the street scale could be explained;
   unexplained variation was attributed to adverse weather, traffic
   accidents and construction. The methods and results presented in this
   paper can improve air quality dispersion modeling of mobile sources, and
   can be used to evaluate and model temporal variation in ambient air
   quality monitoring data and exposure estimates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Hardware-based computer vision accelerators will be an essential part of
   future mobile devices to meet the low power and real-time processing
   requirement. To realize a high energy efficiency and high throughput,
   the accelerator architecture can be massively parallelized and tailored
   to vision processing, which is an advantage over software-based
   solutions and general-purpose hardware. In this work, we present an ASIC
   that is designed to learn and extract features from images and videos.
   The ASIC contains 256 leaky integrate-and-fire neurons connected in a
   scalable two-layer network of 8 8 grids linked in a 4-stage ring. Sparse
   neuron activation and the relatively small grid keep the spike collision
   probability low to save access arbitration. The weight memory is divided
   into core memory and auxiliary memory, such that the auxiliary memory is
   only powered on for learning to save inference power. High-throughput
   inference is accomplished by the parallel operation of neurons.
   Efficient learning is implemented by passing parameter update messages,
   which is further simplified by an approximation technique. A 3.06 mm 65
   nm CMOS ASIC test chip is designed to achieve a maximum inference
   throughput of 1.24 Gpixel/s at 1.0 V and 310 MHz, and on-chip learning
   can be completed in seconds. To improve the power consumption and energy
   efficiency, core memory supply voltage can be reduced to 440 mV to take
   advantage of the error resilience of the algorithm, reducing the
   inference power to 6.67 mW for a 140 Mpixel/s throughput at 35 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular lines are production systems consisting of cells comprised of
   machines performing similar operations. These systems are notorious for
   having excessively long lead time (LT) that are often an order of
   magnitude longer than the total processing time by all machines in the
   system. The main goal of this paper is to carry out an analytical
   investigation of this phenomenon and offer methods for its alleviation.
   To accomplish this, we develop a technique for performance evaluation of
   cellular lines with asymptotically reliable Bernoulli machines and use
   it for analysis and control of LT
   Note to Practitioners-Machining operations are often structured as a
   sequence of manufacturing cells: turning, boring, and drilling. In many
   cases, performance of such manufacturing lines is marred by excessively
   long production lead time, which is the sum of the total processing time
   and the waiting time. Often, the latter is an order of magnitude longer
   than the former. Why does this happen? How can it be alleviated? These
   are the questions addressed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{A self-sustainable sensing platform powered entirely by small-scale
   benthic microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for oceanic sensing applications is
   presented. An ultra-low power chip featuring an ARM Cortex-M0 processor,
   3 kB of SRAM, and power management unit (PMU) is designed to consume 11
   nW in sleep mode for perpetual sensing operation. The PMU includes a
   switched-capacitor DC/ DC converter designed for efficient energy
   harvesting and step-down conversion for a wide range of input and output
   power. A small-scale MFC with 21.3 cm(2) anode surface area was
   connected to the PMU to charge a thin-film battery of 1 mAh capacity. A
   49.3-hour long-term experiment with 8-min sleep interval and 1-s wake-up
   time demonstrated the sustainability of system-on-mud concept. During
   sleep mode operation, the system charges the 4 V battery at 380 nA from
   the micro-MFC generating 5.4 mu w of power, which allows up to 20 mA of
   active mode current with net energy neutrality.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) policies in a
   multiuser multi-channel random access cognitive radio network, where
   users perform channel probing and switching in order to obtain better
   channel condition or higher instantaneous transmission quality. Prior
   studies in this area include those on channel probing and switching
   policies for a single user to exploit spectral diversity, and those on
   probing and access policies for multiple users over a single channel to
   exploit temporal and multiuser diversity. By contrast, in this study we
   consider the collective switching of multiple users over multiple
   channels. This inevitably necessitates explicit modeling of the effect
   of collision. Furthermore, we consider finite arrivals, whereby users
   are not assumed to always have data to send and the demand for channel
   follows a certain arrival process. Under such a scenario, the users'
   ability to opportunistically exploit temporal diversity (the temporal
   variation in channel quality over a single channel) and spectral
   diversity (quality variation across multiple channels at a given time)
   is greatly affected by the level of congestion in the system. We
   investigate the associated decision process in this case, and show that
   the optimal policy is given by a nested stopping rule which may be
   viewed as a type of generalization to results found in existing
   literature in this area. We analytically and numerically evaluate the
   extent to which congestion affects potential gains from opportunistic
   dynamic channel switching.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of planar homing guidance for a vehicle
   traveling to a beacon with unknown location and using a measurement of
   binary range-rate. The fundamental nature of binary range-rate is
   studied, and a guidance law requiring only this measurement is
   presented. Another guidance law utilizing both binary range-rate and
   heading angle is also presented, and stability is addressed. This
   guidance law consists of separated control and observation, and it does
   not require finding the closest points of approach for multiple
   headings. This guidance law's response to measurement corruption and
   observer gain is studied. Characteristics of good initial estimates are
   given, and an exploration method is presented that provides good initial
   estimates and leads to improved response. This approach provides a
   method of low-cost, autonomous homing guidance that utilizes a single,
   omnidirectional receiver to guide a vehicle to a single, omnidirectional
   transmitting beacon.}},

Abstract = {{While time delays typically lead to poor control performance, and even
   instability, previous research shows that time delays can, in some
   cases, be beneficial. This paper presents a new benefit of time-delayed
   control (TDC) for single-input single-output (SISO) linear time
   invariant (LTI) systems: it can be used to improve robustness. Time
   delays can be used to approximate state derivative feedback (SSD), which
   together with state feedback (SF) can reduce sensitivity and improve
   stability margins. Additional sensors are not required since the state
   derivatives are approximated using available measurements and time
   delays. A systematic design approach, based on solution of delay
   differential equations (DDEs) using the Lambert W method, is presented
   using a scalar example. The method is then applied to both single-and
   two-degree of freedom (DOF) mechanical systems. The simulation results
   demonstrate excellent performance with improved stability margins.}},

Title = {{Online Eccentricity Monitoring of Seamless Tubes in Cross-Roll Piercing
   Mill}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{Wall-thickness eccentricity is a major dimensional deviation problem in
   seamless steel tube production. Although eccentricity is mainly caused
   by abnormal process conditions in the cross-roll piercing mill, most
   seamless tube plants lack the monitoring at the hot piercing stage but
   only inspect the quality of finished tubes using ultrasonic testing (UT)
   at the end of all manufacturing processes. This paper develops an online
   monitoring technique to detect abnormal conditions in the cross-roll
   piercing mill. Based on an image-sensing technique, process operation
   condition can be extracted from the vibration signals. Optimal frequency
   features that are sensitive to tube wall-thickness variation are then
   selected through the formulation and solution of a set-covering
   optimization problem. Hotelling T-2 control charts are constructed using
   the selected features for online monitoring. The developed monitoring
   technique enables early detection of eccentricity problems at the hot
   piercing stage, which can facilitate timely adjustment and defect
   prevention. The monitoring technique developed in this paper is generic
   and can be widely applied to the hot piercing process of various
   products. This paper also provides a general framework for effectively
   analyzing image-based sensing data and establishing the linkage between
   product quality information and process information.}},

Abstract = {{The immune response to oral bacteria and the subsequent activation of
   inflammatory signaling is not only dependent on genetic factors. The
   importance of so-called epigenetic mechanisms presents additional
   regulatory pathways of genes involved in maintaining chronic
   inflammation, including gingivitis and periodontitis. The term
   epigenetics relates to changes in gene expression that are not encoded
   in the DNA sequence itself and include chemical alterations of DNA and
   its associated proteins. These changes lead to remodeling of the
   chromatin and subsequent activation or inactivation of a gene.
   Epigenetic mechanisms have been found to contribute to disease,
   including cancer and autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. In this
   state-of-the art review, the authors provide the latest findings on the
   involvement of epigenetic modifications in the development of
   periodontal disease and present emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at
   epigenetic targets (epidrugs) associated with the disruption of tissue

Abstract = {{The ignition process of ethylcyclohexane (ECH) and its two isomers,
   1,3-dimethylcyclohexane (13DMCH) and 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane (12DMCH)
   was investigated in a modified CFR engine. The experiment was conducted
   with intake air temperature-of 155 degrees C, equivalence ratio of 0.5
   and engine speed of 600 rpm. The engine compression ratio (CR) was
   gradually increased in a stepwise manner until autoignition occurred. It
   was found that ECH exhibited a significantly higher oxidation reactivity
   compared to its two isomers. The autoignition criterion was based on CO
   emissions and the apparent heat release rates. Ethylcyclohexane (ECH)
   indicated noticeable two stage ignition behavior, while less significant
   heat release occurred for the two isomers at comparable conditions. The
   mole fractions of unreacted fuel and stable intermediate species over a
   wide range of compression ratios were analyzed by GC-MS and GC-FID. Most
   of the species indicated constant rates of formation and the trends of
   relative yield to unreacted fuel are well in agreement with the
   oxidation reactivity in the low temperature regime. The major
   intermediate species are revealed as a group of conjugate olefins, which
   possess the same molecular structure as the original fuel compound
   except for the presence of a double carbon bond. Conjugate olefins were
   mostly formed through (1,4) H-shift isomerization during the low
   temperature oxidation of alkylcyclohexanes. Conformation analysis
   explains the reactivity differences in the three isomers as well as the
   fractions of intermediate species. The hydrogen availability located in
   alkyl substituents plays an important role in determining oxidation
   reactivity, requiring less activation energy for abstraction through the
   (1,5) H-shift isomerization. This reactivity difference contributes to
   building up the major intermediate species observed during oxidation of
   each test fuel. 12DMCH, whose ignition reactivity is the lowest, less
   favors beta-scission of C-C backbone of cyclic ring, thereby resulting
   in lower concentrations of small olefins and higher concentrations of
   conjugate olefins and large oxygenated species in the low temperature
   regime, prior to autoignition. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.
