Abstract = {{This paper explores two subcycling algorithms for exchanging surface
   flux data over disparate time scales between a computational fluid
   dynamics fire simulation and a conduction heat transfer model. The study
   specifically aims to evaluate the adequacy of a traditional time-sampled
   algorithm in comparison to a proposed time-averaged algorithm. A
   numerical study is carried out on a steel beam exposed to a heptane pool
   fire. The subcycling algorithms are assessed based on accuracy and the
   rate of convergence. The results show that the time-averaged algorithm
   offers greater accuracy and converges more rapidly than the time-sampled
   algorithm due to its ability to provide an energy-equivalent
   representation of the fire boundary conditions. The improved convergence
   rate provided by the time-averaged algorithm allows the time step in the
   conduction heat transfer analysis to be relaxed significantly. Reducing
   the step size in the heat transfer model directly corresponds to
   significant time savings, which is of great importance in the analysis
   of large-scale systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A workshop, known as ``Operation Tomodachi-Fire Research{''} was held in
   Tokyo, Japan from July 1 to July 4, 2012. Tomodachi means friendship in
   Japanese. This workshop, under the direction of Dr. Samuel L. Manzello
   of EL-NIST and Dr. Tokiyoshi Yamada of the University of Tokyo, was
   conducted in partnership with the Japan Association of Fire Science and
   Engineering (JAFSE). The objective was to: (1) develop scientific
   knowledge and translate it to building codes and standards that will be
   of use to both countries to reduce the devastation caused by unwanted
   fires, (2) provide a forum for next generation researchers to present
   their work in order to develop new research collaborations, (3) and
   allow USA participants a chance to visit excellent large-scale research
   facilities available in Japan that are of use to the research topics of
   this workshop. This is a formal continuation of the kickoff meeting held
   at NIST's Engineering Laboratory (EL-NIST) in June 2011. USA
   presentations were delivered from: NIST, Purdue University, University
   of Texas-Austin, Michigan State University, University of Michigan,
   Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), Worcester
   Polytechnic Institute (WPI), University of California-Berkeley,
   California Polytechnic University (CALPOLY), Underwriters laboratories
   (UL), and the University of Delaware (organizations are listed based on

Abstract = {{An image-based method has been developed for rapidly determining the
   size distribution of coarse sand and gravel. The system utilizes a
   back-lit tilting ``translucent segregation table{''} (TST) to segregate
   the particles by size prior to photographing the specimen from above.
   Most significantly, the soil particles need not to be detached from each
   other; they only need to rest on the translucent plate in a single
   layer. An image-processing method called ``watershed segmentation{''}
   digitally separates the soil particles so that each one is individually
   accounted for in the resulting size distribution. A sieve-equivalent
   particle size, which considers the passage of ellipsoids through square
   sieve openings, is obtained for every particle in the specimen. Twenty
   soil specimens were tested by the TST and by sieving. Slight differences
   between sieve and TST results were observed and explanations for the
   minor discrepancies were explored. Considering that the TST uses a
   single camera and just one photograph, it appears to be an attractive
   clean, rapid, and low-cost alternative to sieving.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of calibration data needed to produce images of adequate
   quality can prevent auto-calibrating parallel imaging reconstruction
   methods like generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions
   (GRAPPA) from achieving a high total acceleration factor. To improve the
   quality of calibration when the number of auto-calibration signal (ACS)
   lines is restricted, we propose a sparsity-promoting regularized
   calibration method that finds a GRAPPA kernel consistent with the ACS
   fit equations that yields jointly sparse reconstructed coil channel
   images. Several experiments evaluate the performance of the proposed
   method relative to unregularized and existing regularized calibration
   methods for both low-quality and underdetermined fits from the ACS
   lines. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, like
   other regularization methods, is capable of mitigating noise
   amplification, and in addition, the proposed method is particularly
   effective at minimizing coherent aliasing artifacts caused by poor
   kernel calibration in real data. Using the proposed method, we can
   increase the total achievable acceleration while reducing degradation of
   the reconstructed image better than existing regularized calibration
   methods.}},

Volume = {{182}},

Abstract = {{A thermodynamically-based work potential theory for modeling progressive
   damage and failure in fiber-reinforced laminates is presented. The
   current, multiple-internal state variable (ISV) formulation, referred to
   as enhanced Schapery theory, utilizes separate ISVs for modeling the
   effects of damage and failure. Damage is considered to be the effect of
   any structural changes in a material that manifest as pre-peak
   non-linearity in the stress versus strain response. Conversely, failure
   is taken to be the effect of the evolution of any mechanisms that
   results in post-peak strain softening, resulting in a negative tangent
   stiffness. It is assumed that matrix microdamage is the dominant damage
   mechanism in continuous fiber-reinforced polymer matrix laminates, and
   its evolution is controlled with a single ISV. Three additional ISVs are
   introduced to account for failure due to mode I transverse cracking,
   mode II transverse cracking, and mode I axial failure. Typically,
   failure evolution (i.e., post-peak strain softening characterized
   through a negative tangent stiffness) results in pathologically mesh
   dependent solutions within a finite element (FE) framework. Therefore,
   consistent characteristic lengths are introduced into the formulation to
   govern the evolution of the three failure ISVs. Using the stationarity
   of the total work potential with respect to each ISV, a set of
   thermodynamically consistent evolution equations for the ISVs are
   derived. The theory is implemented in association with the commercial FE
   software, Abaqus. Objectivity of total energy dissipated during the
   failure process, with regards to refinements in the FE mesh, is
   demonstrated. The model is also verified against experimental results
   from two laminated, T800/3900-2 panels containing a central notch and
   different fiber-orientation stacking sequences. Global load versus
   displacement, global load versus local strain gage data, and macroscopic
   failure paths obtained from the models are compared against the
   experimental results.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{4349-4364}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Production systems are often managed to maximise their production rate
   (). In some cases, this leads to excessive work-in-process and, as a
   result, long production lead time (). This issue is of particular
   importance in systems with unlimited' buffer space, where may also
   become unlimited. The question addressed in this paper is: What should
   be the release rate of raw materials so that the desired is obtained,
   while is maximised? We answer this question for serial lines with
   infinite buffers and machines obeying the Bernoulli reliability model.
   Specifically, given a serial line, we quantify the set of attainable s
   (feasible set), and for each point in the feasible set provide the
   release rate (as a function of machine parameters) that guarantees the
   desired lead time, while maximising the production rate. In addition, we
   offer a feedback control law that enforces the desired system behaviour.
   The development is based on a recursive aggregation procedure that leads
   to analytical estimates of . The accuracy of these estimates is
   evaluated by simulations and is shown to be acceptable for practical
   applications (well within 5\%). The results obtained offer small- and
   mid-size enterprises the possibility of managing their production lead
   time, when neither limited buffers nor kanban/CONWIP systems are
   available, by releasing raw materials on, say, an hourly basis.}},

Title = {{Mechanical and energetic consequences of rolling foot shape in human

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{216}},
Number = {{14}},

Abstract = {{During human walking, the center of pressure under the foot progresses
   forward smoothly during each step, creating a wheel-like motion between
   the leg and the ground. This rolling motion might appear to aid walking
   economy, but the mechanisms that may lead to such a benefit are unclear,
   as the leg is not literally a wheel. We propose that there is indeed a
   benefit, but less from rolling than from smoother transitions between
   pendulum-like stance legs. The velocity of the body center of mass (COM)
   must be redirected in that transition, and a longer foot reduces the
   work required for the redirection. Here we develop a dynamic walking
   model that predicts different effects from altering foot length as
   opposed to foot radius, and test it by attaching rigid, arc-like foot
   bottoms to humans walking with fixed ankles. The model suggests that
   smooth rolling is relatively insensitive to arc radius, whereas work for
   the step-to-step transition decreases approximately quadratically with
   foot length. We measured the separate effects of arc-foot length and
   radius on COM velocity fluctuations, work performed by the legs and
   metabolic cost. Experimental data (N=8) show that foot length indeed has
   much greater effect on both the mechanical work of the step-to-step
   transition (23\% variation, P=0.04) and the overall energetic cost of
   walking (6\%, P=0.03) than foot radius (no significant effect, P>0.05).
   We found the minimum metabolic energy cost for an arc foot length of
   approximately 29\% of leg length, roughly comparable to human foot
   length. Our results suggest that the foot's apparently wheel-like action
   derives less benefit from rolling per se than from reduced work to
   redirect the body COM.}},

Abstract = {{Personalization is an emerging manufacturing paradigm whereby customers
   can tailor products to their individual needs while maintaining high
   production efficiency. This paradigm necessitates ``personalized product
   architecting{''} for determination of customizable/personalizable
   product modules and cost-effective manufacturing methods. This paper
   presents an initial effort in developing a method for identifying
   appropriate product architectures and manufacturing resolutions to
   achieve personalization considering functional utility and manufacturing
   cost. Ergonomic experiments and conjoint analysis are implemented to
   build functions relating manufacturability, price, and utility. Using
   these functions, a case study based on shoe products is conducted and
   the common integer programming welfare problem is expanded to a
   mixed-integer programming optimization problem for determination of a
   product family incorporating both personalized and customized offerings.

   into account the defect rates in components and assembly tasks. The
   defect rate of the final assembly product is to be minimized considering
   type II errors in subassembly inspection. A numerical example is
   presented to demonstrate the methodology, and this numerical study shows
   that assembly decomposition strongly affects the final assembly defect

Abstract = {{We examine carefully the accuracy of stochastic rotational dynamics
   (SRD) simulations for isolated polymer chains in a solvent, where SRD
   incorporates hydrodynamic interaction (HI) through momentum exchange
   (collisions) between polymer beads and solvent beads, both of which are
   assigned mass. We show that the main error is due to the inertial effect
   that finite bead mass has on polymer hydrodynamics. We find that the
   inertial effect is negligible when R-g, the radius of gyration of the
   polymer chain is much larger than L-M, the distance over which bead
   inertia is lost due to collisions with solvent. For moderate HI, good
   agreement is found between the rotational relaxation time simulated by
   SRD with that from normal-mode analysis and from Brownian dynamics (BD)
   simulations, even for short five-bead chains. For dominant HI, for short
   chains, we can minimize the inertial effect by varying the ratio of
   polymer to solvent bead mass. For long chains (R-g >> L-M) SRD and BD
   relaxation times agree, but are larger than those from normal-mode
   analysis due to neglect of fluctuating HI in the latter. We also find
   that, using the same parameters, the SRD method can reproduce the BD
   results obtained by Jendrejack et al. for a k-DNA chain in viscosified
   water. (C) 2013 The Society of Rheology.}},

Title = {{FusionArc optimization: A hybrid volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)
   and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning strategy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To introduce a hybrid volumetric modulated arc
   therapy/intensity modulated radiation therapy (VMAT/IMRT) optimization
   strategy called FusionArc that combines the delivery efficiency of
   single-arc VMAT with the potentially desirable intensity modulation
   possible with IMRT.
   Methods: A beamlet-based inverse planning system was enhanced to combine
   the advantages of VMAT and IMRT into one comprehensive technique. In the
   hybrid strategy, baseline single-arc VMAT plans are optimized and then
   the current cost function gradients with respect to the beamlets are
   used to define a metric for predicting which beam angles would benefit
   from further intensity modulation. Beams with the highest metric values
   (called the gradient factor) are converted from VMAT apertures to IMRT
   fluence, and the optimization proceeds with the mixed variable set until
   convergence or until additional beams are selected for conversion. One
   phantom and two clinical cases were used to validate the gradient factor
   and characterize the FusionArc strategy. Comparisons were made between
   standard IMRT, single-arc VMAT, and FusionArc plans with one to five
   IMRT/hybrid beams.
   Results: The gradient factor was found to be highly predictive of the
   VMAT angles that would benefit plan quality the most from beam
   modulation. Over the three cases studied, a FusionArc plan with three
   converted beams achieved superior dosimetric quality with reductions in
   final cost ranging from 26.4\% to 48.1\% compared to single-arc VMAT.
   Additionally, the three beam FusionArc plans required 22.4\%-43.7\%
   fewer MU/Gy than a seven beam IMRT plan. While the FusionArc plans with
   five converted beams offer larger reductions in final cost-32.9\%-55.2\%
   compared to single-arc VMAT-the decrease in MU/Gy compared to IMRT was
   noticeably smaller at 12.2\%-18.5\%, when compared to IMRT.
   Conclusions: A hybrid VMAT/IMRT strategy was implemented to find a high
   quality compromise between gantry-angle and intensity-based degrees of
   freedom. This optimization method will allow patients to be
   simultaneously planned for dosimetric quality and delivery efficiency
   without switching between delivery techniques. Example phantom and
   clinical cases suggest that the conversion of only three VMAT segments
   to modulated beams may result in a good combination of quality and
   efficiency. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) is an antiapoptotic protein that is
   overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, which has been
   implicated in development of radio- and chemoresistance. Small molecule
   inhibitors such as AT-101 (a BH3-mimetic drug) have been developed to
   inhibit the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-2 proteins, which proved
   effective in restoring radio-and chemo-sensitivity in head and neck
   cancer cells. However, high doses of AT-101 are associated with
   gastrointestinal, hepatic, and fertility side effects, which prompted
   the search for other Bcl-2 inhibitors. Short interfering RNA (siRNA)
   proved to inhibit antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression and trigger
   cancer cell death. However, transforming siRNA molecules into a viable
   therapy remains a challenge due to the lack of efficient and
   biocompatible carriers. We report the development of degradable
   star-shaped polymers that proved to condense anti-Bcl-2 siRNA into
   ``smart{''} pH-sensitive and membrane-destabilizing particles that
   shuttle their cargo past the endosomal membrane and into the cytoplasm
   of head and neck cancer cells. Results show that ``smart{''} anti-Bcl-2
   particles reduced the mRNA and protein levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2
   protein in UM-SCC-17B cancer cells by 50-60\% and 65-75\%, respectively.
   Results also show that combining ``smart{''} anti-Bcl-2 particles with
   the IC25 of AT-101 (inhibitory concentration responsible for killing
   25\% of the cells) synergistically inhibits cancer cell proliferation
   and increases cell apoptosis, which reduce the survival of UM-SCC-17B
   cancer cells compared to treatment with AT-101 alone. Results indicate
   the therapeutic benefit of combining siRNA-mediated knockdown of
   antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression with low doses of AT-101 for
   inhibiting the growth of head and neck cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{Conjugated polymers with a one-dimensional p-orbital overlap exhibit
   optoelectronic anisotropy. Their unique anisotropic properties can be
   fully realized in device applications only when the conjugated chains
   are aligned. Here, we report a molecular design principle of conjugated
   polymers to achieve concentration-regulated chain planarization,
   self-assembly, liquid-crystal-like good mobility and non-interdigitated
   side chains. As a consequence of these intra- and intermolecular
   attributes, chain alignment along an applied flow field occurs. This
   liquid-crystalline conjugated polymer was realized by incorporating
   intramolecular sulphur-fluorine interactions and bulky side chains
   linked to a tetrahedral carbon having a large form factor. By optimizing
   the polymer concentration and the flow field, we could achieve a high
   dichroic ratio of 16.67 in emission from conducting conjugated polymer
   films. Two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction was performed
   to analyse a well-defined conjugated polymer alignment. Thin-film
   transistors built on highly aligned conjugated polymer films showed more
   than three orders of magnitude faster carrier mobility along the
   conjugated polymer alignment direction than the perpendicular direction.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Inner ear development involves signaling from surrounding
   tissues, including the adjacent hindbrain, periotic mesenchyme, and
   notochord. These signals include SHH, FGFs, BMPs, and WNTs from the
   hindbrain and SHH from the notochord. Zic genes, which are expressed in
   the dorsal neural tube and act during neural development, have been
   implicated as effectors of these pathways. This report examines whether
   Zic genes' involvement in inner ear development is a tenable hypothesis
   based on their expression patterns. RESULTS: In the developing inner ear
   of both the chick and mouse, all of the Zic genes were expressed in the
   dorsal neural tube and variably in the periotic mesenchyme, but
   expression of the Zic genes in the otic epithelium was not found. The
   onset of expression differed among the Zic genes; within any given
   region surrounding the otic epithelium, multiple Zic genes were
   expressed in the same place at the same time. CONCLUSIONS: Zic gene
   expression in the region of the developing inner ear is similar between
   mouse and chick. Zic expression domains overlap with sites of WNT and
   SHH signaling during otocyst patterning, suggesting a role for Zic genes
   in modulating signaling from these pathways. Developmental Dynamics

Abstract = {{A general model of decentralized stochastic control called partial
   history sharing information structure is presented. In this model, at
   each step the controllers share part of their observation and control
   history with each other. This general model subsumes several existing
   models of information sharing as special cases. Based on the information
   commonly known to all the controllers, the decentralized problem is
   reformulated as an equivalent centralized problem from the perspective
   of a coordinator. The coordinator knows the common information and
   selects prescriptions that map each controller's local information to
   its control actions. The optimal control problem at the coordinator is
   shown to be a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) which
   is solved using techniques from Markov decision theory. This approach
   provides 1) structural results for optimal strategies and 2) a dynamic
   program for obtaining optimal strategies for all controllers in the
   original decentralized problem. Thus, this approach unifies the various
   ad-hoc approaches taken in the literature. In addition, the structural
   results on optimal control strategies obtained by the proposed approach
   cannot be obtained by the existing generic approach (the
   person-by-person approach) for obtaining structural results in
   decentralized problems; and the dynamic program obtained by the proposed
   approach is simpler than that obtained by the existing generic approach
   (the designer's approach) for obtaining dynamic programs in
   decentralized problems.}},

Abstract = {{In production lines, multi-machine stages are pervasive in factory. In
   order to take advantage of analytical methods developed for transfer
   lines and assembly lines to analyze, optimize, and design the lines with
   multi-machine stages, a usual way is to aggregate each of such stages
   into a single machine. Aggregation results of existing methods may
   depend on the order of aggregation, which makes the choice of the
   aggregation order an open problem. In addition, existing exact
   aggregation methods are limited to two- or three-stage production lines
   due to the curse of dimensionality; for the approximate methods,
   aggregation errors sometimes are unacceptable. Inspired by some existing
   methods, in this paper, we introduce the steady-state equivalence of
   production lines, based on which we develop a unified effective method
   to figure out parameters of a single machine which is equivalent to the
   multi-machine stage. The developed aggregation method is independent of
   the aggregation order. It is tested on numerous series-parallel example
   lines and a practical general assembly line. Extensive experiments show
   that under various machine reliability models with the coefficient of
   variation of failure and repair times less than 3, aggregation errors of
   the throughput are less than 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{In real-time systems, correctness depends not only on functionality but
   also on timeliness. A great number of scheduling theories have been
   developed for verification of the temporal correctness of jobs
   (software) in such systems. Among them, the Earliest Deadline first
   until Zero-Laxity (EDZL) scheduling algorithm has received growing
   attention thanks to its effectiveness in multicore real-time scheduling.
   However, the true potential of EDZL has not yet been fully exploited in
   its schedulability analysis as the state-of-the-art EDZL analysis
   techniques involve considerable pessimism. In this paper, we propose a
   new EDZL multicore schedulability test. We first introduce an
   interesting observation that suggests an insight toward pessimism
   reduction in the schedulability analysis of EDZL. We then incorporate it
   into a well-known existing Earliest Deadline First (EDF) schedulability
   test, resulting in a new EDZL schedulability test. We demonstrate that
   the proposed EDZL test not only has lower time complexity than existing
   EDZL schedulability tests, but also significantly improves the
   schedulability of EDZL by up to 36.6 percent compared to the best
   existing EDZL schedulability tests.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To explore the feasibility of a novel approach using an
   augmented one-class learning algorithm to model in-laboratory
   complications of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
   Materials and methods Data from the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan
   Cardiovascular Consortium (BMC2) multicenter registry for the years 2007
   and 2008 (n= 41 016) were used to train models to predict 13 different
   in-laboratory PCI complications using a novel one-plus-class support
   vector machine (OP-SVM) algorithm. The performance of these models in
   terms of discrimination and calibration was compared to the performance
   of models trained using the following classification algorithms on BMC2
   data from 2009 (n= 20 289): logistic regression (LR), one-class support
   vector machine classification (OC-SVM), and two-class support vector
   machine classification (TC-SVM). For the OP-SVM and TC-SVM approaches,
   variants of the algorithms with cost-sensitive weighting were also
   considered.
   Results The OP-SVM algorithm and its cost-sensitive variant achieved the
   highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the
   majority of the PCI complications studied (eight cases). Similar
   improvements were observed for the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi(2) value (seven
   cases) and the mean cross-entropy error (eight cases).
   Conclusions The OP-SVM algorithm based on an augmented one-class
   learning problem improved discrimination and calibration across
   different PCI complications relative to LR and traditional support
   vector machine classification. Such an approach may have value in a
   broader range of clinical domains.}},

Abstract = {{Wavelength-scanning interferometry can measure thickness of transparent
   plates by differentiating optical path differences from multiple surface

   technique for two-dimensional transparent plate thickness measurements.
   Wavelength stepping allows practical high-resolution and large optics
   measurements. Systematic errors caused by nonlinearities in laser source
   stepping are reduced with synthetic wavelengths measured by a reference
   array using the phase unwrapping technique. Sub-micron measurement
   accuracy is achieved using the proposed method for a step height
   standard etched on a 3 mm quartz block.}},

Title = {{Hybrid Monte Carlo-CMFD Methods for Accelerating Fission Source

Abstract = {{In this paper, two modifications to improve the efficiency of Lee et
   al.'s recently proposed ``CMFD {[}coarse-mesh finite
   difference]-accelerated Monte Carlo{''} method for neutron criticality
   problems are presented and tested. This CMFD method employs standard
   Monte Carlo techniques to estimate nonlinear functionals (ratios of
   integrals), which are used in low-order CMFD equations to obtain the
   eigenvalue and discrete representations of the eigenfunction. In a
   ``feedback{''} procedure, the Monte Carlo fission source is then
   modified to match the resulting CMFD fission source. The proposed new
   methods differ from the CMFD-accelerated Monte Carlo method only in the
   definition of the nonlinear functionals. The new methods are compared
   with the CMFD-accelerated Monte Carlo method for two
   high-dominance-ratio test problems. All of the hybrid methods rapidly
   converge the Monte Carlo fission source, enabling a large reduction in
   the number of inactive cycles. However, the new methods stabilize the
   fission source more efficiently than the CMFD -accelerated Monte Carlo
   method, enabling a reduction in the number of active cycles as well.
   Also, in all the hybrid methods, the apparent variance of the
   eigenfunction is nearly equal to the real variance, so the real
   statistical error is well estimated from a single calculation. This is a
   major advantage over the standard Monte Carlo method, in which the real
   variance is typically underestimated due to intercycle correlations.}},

Abstract = {{A power scalable thulium-doped fiber-amplifier-based supercontinuum (SC)
   laser covering the shortwave infrared region from 2 to 2.5 mu m is

   spectral density of >12 dBm/nm. Power scalability of the laser is proven
   by showing that the SC laser maintains a nearly constant spectral
   output, beam quality (M-2 measurements), and output spectral stability
   as the SC average power is scaled from 5 to 25.7 W average output power.
   We verify that the SC laser beam is nearly diffraction limited with an
   M-2 < 1.2 for all power levels. Output spectral stability measurements
   with power scaling show a radiometric variability of <0.8\% across the

Abstract = {{Background Recent evidence suggests that head and neck squamous cell
   carcinomas (HNSCCs) harbor a small subpopulation of highly tumorigenic
   cells, designated cancer stem cells. A limiting factor in cancer stem
   cell research is the intrinsic difficulty of expanding cells in an
   undifferentiated state in vitro. Methods Here, we describe the
   development of the orosphere assay, a method for the study of putative
   head and neck cancer stem cells. An orosphere is defined as a
   nonadherent colony of cells sorted from primary HNSCCs or from HNSCC
   cell lines and cultured in 3-dimensional soft agar or ultralow
   attachment plates. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and CD44 expression
   were used here as stem cell markers. Results This assay allowed for the
   propagation of head and neck cancer cells that retained stemness and
   self-renewal. Conclusion The orosphere assay is well suited for studies
   designed to understand the pathobiology of head and neck cancer stem
   cells. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2013}},

Abstract = {{Particle shape is becoming increasingly recognized as an important
   parameter for the development of vascular-targeted carriers (VTCs) for
   disease treatment and diagnosis. However, limited research exists that
   investigates how particle shape coupled with hemodynamics affects VTC
   margination (localization and adhesion). In this study, we investigate
   the effects of particle shape parameters (volume, aspect ratio, axis
   length) on the margination efficacy of targeted spheres and prolate
   ellipsoids (rods) to an inflamed endothelial wall from human blood flow
   in an in vitro model of human vasculature. Overall, particles with 2 mu
   m equivalent spherical diameters (ESD) display higher margination than
   particles with either 1 gm or 500 nm ESDs. Interestingly, rod-shaped
   rnicroparticles (1 mu m or 2 mu m ESD) with high aspect ratios display
   significantly improved margination compared to spheres of equal volume,
   particularly under high shear rates and disturbed flow profiles.
   Nanorods (500 nm ESD), even with high aspect ratio, do not display
   enhanced margination compared to that of equivalent spheres, which
   suggests that nanorods, like nanospheres, display minimal margination
   due to their inability to effectively localize to the vessel wall in the
   presence of RBCs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work evaluated the inhibitory effect of dissolved silica on
   arsenite adsorption to nanoparticulate FeS (NP-FeS) or mackinawite and

   contrast to the known inhibitory effect of dissolved silica on As(III)
   uptake by Fe-(hydr)oxide systems. However, some inhibition was observed
   in CS-FeS system at pH 9. This latter result is attributed to the
   co-existence of both FeS and small amounts of Fe-(hydr)oxide phases on
   the sand surface. Given the ubiquitous presence of dissolved Si in
   groundwater, FeS-based sorbents may have an advantage for As retention
   compared to those based on Fe-(hydr)oxides in reducing subsurface

   A generalized 2-D formulation is presented to determine the interfaces
   most susceptible to delamination. Subsequently, cohesive elements are
   added along these interfaces to introduce delamination capability in the

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates the design procedure for a dual-band branch-line
   coupler that is capable of having an arbitrary coupling level. Simply
   with an additional parallel line that connect the centers of the two

   structural simplicity is preserved. Moreover, the practical range of
   power-split ratio is relatively wider than previous dual-band
   branch-line couplers. A detailed design procedure is presented.
   Experimental results for dual-band couplers centered at 1 and 2.5GHz
   with +/- 3-dB power-split ratios show great agreement with theoretical
   results. The power-split ratio remains within 0.5dB from the specified,

Abstract = {{Scaffoldless engineered 3D skeletal muscle tissue created from satellite
   cells offers the potential to replace muscle tissue that is lost due to
   severe trauma or disease. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-1)
   plays a vital role in mediating migration and differentiation of
   satellite cells during the early stages of muscle development.
   Additionally, TGF-1 promotes collagen type I synthesis in the
   extracellular matrix (ECM) of skeletal muscle, which provides a passive
   elastic substrate to support myofibres and facilitate the transmission
   of force. To determine the role of TGF-1 in skeletal muscle construct
   formation and contractile function in vitro, we created
   tissue-engineered 3D skeletal muscle constructs with varying levels of
   recombinant TGF-1 added to the cell culture medium. Prior to the
   addition of TGF-1, the primary cell population was composed of 75\%
   Pax7-positive cells. The peak force for twitch, tetanus and spontaneous
   force were significantly increased in the presence of 2.0ng/ml TGF-1
   when compared to 0, 0.5 and 1.0ng/ml TGF-1. Visualization of the
   cellular structure with H\&E and with immunofluorescence staining for
   sarcomeric myosin heavy chains and collagen type I showed denser regions
   of better organized myofibres in the presence of 2.0ng/ml TGF-1 versus
   0, 0.5 and 1.0ng/ml. The addition of 2.0ng/ml TGF-1 to the culture
   medium of engineered 3D skeletal muscle constructs enhanced
   contractility and extracellular matrix organization. Copyright (c) 2012

Title = {{Shifted inferior frontal laterality in women with major depressive

Abstract = {{Background. Facial emotion perception (FEP) is a critical human skill
   for successful social interaction, and a substantial body of literature
   suggests that explicit FEP is disrupted in major depressive disorder
   (MDD). Prior research suggests that weakness in FEP may be an important
   phenomenon underlying patterns of emotionprocessing challenges in MDD
   and the disproportionate frequency of MDD in women.
   Method. Women with (n=24) and without (n=22) MDD, equivalent in age and
   education, completed a FEP task during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging.
   Results. The MDD group exhibited greater extents of frontal, parietal
   and subcortical activation compared with the control group during FEP.
   Activation in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) appeared shifted from a
   left >right pattern observed in healthy women to a bilateral pattern in
   MDD women. The ratio of left to right suprathreshold IFG voxels in
   healthy controls was nearly 3 : 1, whereas in the MDD group, there was a
   greater percentage of suprathreshold IFG voxels bilaterally, with no
   leftward bias. In MDD, relatively greater activation in right IFG
   compared with left IFG (ratio score) was present and predicted FEP
   accuracy (r=0.56, p<0.004), with an inverse relationship observed
   between FEP and subgenual cingulate activation (r=-0.46, p=0.02).
   Conclusions. This study links, for the first time, disrupted IFG
   activation laterality and increased subgenual cingulate activation with
   deficient FEP in women with MDD, providing an avenue for
   imaging-to-assessment translational applications in MDD.}},

Abstract = {{Studies concerning the influence of fluidizing air on the gas-solid flow
   that occurs when a high-speed jet is injected into a fluidized bed have
   been limited to the measurement and analysis of mean velocity profiles.
   This study presents Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements and
   analysis of the change in the fluctuations of both gas and particle
   phase velocities inside the jet plume region with change in the
   fluidized state of the emulsion. It is observed that there is a small
   decrease in the fluctuating intensity in both phases upon increasing the
   fluidization velocity from 0 to 0.7 times minimum fluidization. However,
   increasing the fluidization rate (distributor gas flow rate) beyond
   minimum fluidization significantly increases the intensity of velocity
   fluctuations in both phases. A qualitative explanation based on the
   coupling that occurs between the two phases through the mean flow
   variables is proposed to explain the observations. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{358-370}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) use grid electricity as well as
   on-board gasoline for motive force. These multiple energy sources make
   prediction of PHEV energy consumption challenging and also complicate
   evaluation of their environmental impacts. This paper introduces a novel
   PHEV energy consumption modeling approach and compares it to a second
   approach from the literature, each using actual trip patterns from the
   2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). The first approach applies
   distance-dependent fuel efficiency and on-road electricity consumption
   rates based on naturalistic or real world, driving information to
   determine gasoline and electricity consumption. The second uses
   consumption rates derived in accordance with government certification
   testing. Both approaches are applied in the context of a
   location-specific case study that focuses on the state of Michigan. The
   two PHEV models show agreement in electricity demand due to vehicle
   charging, gasoline consumption, and life cycle environmental impacts for
   this case study. The naturalistic drive cycle approach is explored as a
   means of extending location-specific driving data to supplement existing
   PHEV impact assessments methods. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We address the problem of rapidly discovering spectrum opportunities for
   seamless service provisioning in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In
   particular, we focus on multichannel communications via channel-bonding
   with heterogeneous channel characteristics of ON/OFF patterns, sensing
   time, and channel capacity. Using dynamic programming (DP), we derive an
   optimal online sensing sequence incurring a minimal
   opportunity-discovery delay, and propose a suboptimal sequence that
   presents a near-optimal performance while incurring significantly less
   computational overhead than the DP algorithm. To facilitate fast
   opportunity discovery, we also propose a channel-management strategy
   that maintains a list of backup channels to be used at building the
   optimal sequence. A hybrid of maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
   inference is introduced as well for flexible estimation of ON/OFF
   channel-usage patterns, which selectively chooses the better between the
   two according to the frequency of sensing and ON/OFF durations. The
   performance of the proposed schemes, in terms of the
   opportunity-discovery delay, is evaluated via in-depth simulation, and
   for the scenarios we considered, the proposed suboptimal sequence
   achieves a near-optimal performance with only an average of 0.5 percent
   difference from the optimal delay, and outperforms the previously
   proposed probabilistic scheme by up to 50.1 percent. In addition, the
   backup channel update scheme outperforms the no-update case by up to
   49.9 percent.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the dosimetric improvements in stereotactic body
   radiation therapy for patients with larger or central lung tumors using
   a highly noncoplanar 4 pi planning system.
   Methods and Materials: This study involved 12 patients with centrally
   located or larger lung tumors previously treated with 7- to 9-field
   static beam intensity modulated radiation therapy to 50 Gy. They were
   replanned using volumetric modulated arc therapy and 4 pi plans, in
   which a column generation method was used to optimize the beam
   orientation and the fluence map. Maximum doses to the heart, esophagus,
   trachea/bronchus, and spinal cord, as well as the 50\% isodose volume,
   the lung volumes receiving 20, 10, and 5 Gy were minimized and compared
   against the clinical plans. A dose escalation study was performed to
   determine whether a higher prescription dose to the tumor would be
   achievable using 4 pi without violating dose limits set by the clinical
   plans. The deliverability of 4 pi plans was preliminarily tested.
   Results: Using 4 pi plans, the maximum heart, esophagus, trachea,
   bronchus and spinal cord doses were reduced by 32\%, 72\%, 37\%, 44\%,
   and 53\% (P <= .001), respectively, and R-50 was reduced by more than
   50\%. Lung V-20, V-10, and V-5 were reduced by 64\%, 53\%, and 32\% (P
   <= .001), respectively. The improved sparing of organs at risk was
   achieved while also improving planning target volume (PTV) coverage. The
   minimal PTV doses were increased by the 4 pi plans by 12\% (P =. 002).
   Consequently, escalated PTV doses of 68 to 70 Gy were achieved in all
   patients.
   Conclusions: We have shown that there is a large potential for plan
   quality improvement and dose escalation for patients with larger or
   centrally located lung tumors using noncoplanar beams with sufficient
   quality and quantity. Compared against the clinical volumetric modulated
   arc therapy and static intensity modulated radiation therapy plans, the
   4 pi plans yielded significantly and consistently improved tumor
   coverage and critical organ sparing. Given the known challenges in
   central structure dose constraints in stereotactic body radiation
   therapy to the lung, 4 pi planning may increase efficacy and reduce
   toxicity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.}},

   12.7-by-12.7 and 7.6-by-7.6 cm detectors. It is demonstrated that the
   dependence on detector size is important for the light output response
   functions, but not to the same extent for the resolution function, even

Abstract = {{Biomineral coatings have been extensively used to enhance the
   osteoconductivity of polymeric scaffolds. Numerous porous scaffolds have
   previously been coated with a bone-like apatite mineral through
   incubation in simulated body fluid (SBF). However, characterization of
   the mineral layer formed on scaffolds, including the amount of mineral
   within the scaffolds, often requires destructive methods. We have
   developed a method using micro-computed tomography (mu-CT) scanning to
   nondestructively quantify the amount of mineral in vitro and in vivo on
   biodegradable scaffolds made of poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and poly
   (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL). PLLA and PCL scaffolds were fabricated
   using an indirect solid freeform fabrication (SFF) technique to achieve
   orthogonally interconnected pore architectures. Biomineral coatings were
   formed on the fabricated PLLA and PCL scaffolds after incubation in
   modified SBF (mSBF). Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction
   confirmed the formation of an apatite-like mineral. The scaffolds were
   implanted into mouse ectopic sites for 3 and 10 weeks. The presence of a
   biomineral coating within the porous scaffolds was confirmed through
   plastic embedding and mu-CT techniques. Tissue mineral content (TMC) and
   volume of mineral on the scaffold surfaces detected by mu-CT had a
   strong correlation with the amount of calcium measured by the
   orthocresolphthalein complex-one (OCPC) method before and after
   implantation. There was a strong correlation between OCPC pre- and
   postimplantation and mu-CT measured TMC (R-2 = 0.96 preimplant; R-2 =
   0.90 postimplant) and mineral volume (R-2 = 0.96 preimplant; R-2 = 0.89
   postimplant). The mu-CT technique showed increases in mineral following
   implantation, suggesting that mu-CT can be used to nondestructively
   determine the amount of calcium on coated scaffolds.}},

   Photoconductive Terahertz Emitters}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{77}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this video article we present a detailed demonstration of a highly
   efficient method for generating terahertz waves. Our technique is based
   on photoconduction, which has been one of the most commonly used
   techniques for terahertz generation (1-8). Terahertz generation in a
   photoconductive emitter is achieved by pumping an ultrafast
   photoconductor with a pulsed or heterodyned laser illumination. The
   induced photocurrent, which follows the envelope of the pump laser, is
   routed to a terahertz radiating antenna connected to the photoconductor
   contact electrodes to generate terahertz radiation. Although the quantum
   efficiency of a photoconductive emitter can theoretically reach 100\%,
   the relatively long transport path lengths of photo-generated carriers
   to the contact electrodes of conventional photoconductors have severely
   limited their quantum efficiency. Additionally, the carrier screening
   effect and thermal breakdown strictly limit the maximum output power of
   conventional photoconductive terahertz sources. To address the quantum
   efficiency limitations of conventional photoconductive terahertz
   emitters, we have developed a new photoconductive emitter concept which
   incorporates a plasmonic contact electrode configuration to offer high
   quantum-efficiency and ultrafast operation simultaneously. By using
   nano-scale plasmonic contact electrodes, we significantly reduce the
   average photo-generated carrier transport path to photoconductor contact
   electrodes compared to conventional photoconductors (9). Our method also
   allows increasing photoconductor active area without a considerable
   increase in the capacitive loading to the antenna, boosting the maximum
   terahertz radiation power by preventing the carrier screening effect and
   thermal breakdown at high optical pump powers. By incorporating
   plasmonic contact electrodes, we demonstrate enhancing the
   optical-to-terahertz power conversion efficiency of a conventional
   photoconductive terahertz emitter by a factor of 50 (10).}},

Title = {{Fabrication of Carbon Nanotube High-Frequency Nanoelectronic Biosensor
   for Sensing in High Ionic Strength Solutions}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{77}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The unique electronic properties and high surface-to-volume ratios of
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) and semiconductor nanowires (NW)
   (1-4) make them good candidates for high sensitivity biosensors. When a
   charged molecule binds to such a sensor surface, it alters the carrier
   density(5) in the sensor, resulting in changes in its DC conductance.
   However, in an ionic solution a charged surface also attracts
   counterions from the solution, forming an electrical double layer (EDL).
   This EDL effectively screens off the charge, and in physiologically
   relevant conditions similar to 100 millimolar (mM), the characteristic
   charge screening length (Debye length) is less than a nanometer (nm).
   Thus, in high ionic strength solutions, charge based (DC) detection is
   fundamentally impeded(6-8).
   We overcome charge screening effects by detecting molecular dipoles
   rather than charges at high frequency, by operating carbon nanotube
   field effect transistors as high frequency mixers(9-11). At high
   frequencies, the AC drive force can no longer overcome the solution drag
   and the ions in solution do not have sufficient time to form the EDL.
   Further, frequency mixing technique allows us to operate at frequencies
   high enough to overcome ionic screening, and yet detect the sensing
   signals at lower frequencies(11-12). Also, the high transconductance of
   SWNT transistors provides an internal gain for the sensing signal, which
   obviates the need for external signal amplifier.
   Here, we describe the protocol to (a) fabricate SWNT transistors, (b)
   functionalize biomolecules to the nanotube(13), (c) design and stamp a
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-fluidic chamber(14) onto the device,
   and (d) carry out high frequency sensing in different ionic strength
   solutions(11).}},

Title = {{Force Measurement During Contraction to Assess Muscle Function in
   Zebrafish Larvae}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{77}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Zebrafish larvae provide models of muscle development, muscle disease
   and muscle-related chemical toxicity, but related studies often lack
   functional measures of muscle health. In this video article, we
   demonstrate a method to measure force generation during contraction of
   zebrafish larval trunk muscle. Force measurements are accomplished by
   placing an anesthetized larva into a chamber filled with a salt
   solution. The anterior end of the larva is tied to a force transducer
   and the posterior end of the larva is tied to a length controller. An
   isometric twitch contraction is elicited by electric field stimulation
   and the force response is recorded for analysis. Force generation during
   contraction provides a measure of overall muscle health and specifically
   provides a measure of muscle function. Although we describe this
   technique for use with wild-type larvae, this method can be used with
   genetically modified larvae or with larvae treated with drugs or
   toxicants, to characterize muscle disease models and evaluate
   treatments, or to study muscle development, injury, or chemical

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a general framework for tracking multiple,

   estimate both the camera's ego-motion and the people's paths within a
   single coherent framework. The tracking problem is framed as finding the
   MAP solution of a posterior probability, and is solved using the
   reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) particle filtering
   method. We evaluate our system on challenging datasets taken from moving
   cameras, including an outdoor street scene video dataset, as well as an
   indoor RGB-D dataset collected in an office. Experimental evidence shows
   that the proposed method can robustly estimate a camera's motion from
   dynamic scenes and stably track people who are moving independently or

Abstract = {{We present results for stiffness and damping prediction in a class of
   layered, wavy, metal-polymer composites that exceed conventionally
   published stiffness-damping maps (The Wang-Lakes line, see {[}14]).
   These composites are realized by judiciously placing selected, wavy,
   metal sheets that sandwich an ultra-thin layer of polymer. Stacks of
   alternating metal-polymer layered composites, when compressed axially
   under harmonic loading exhibit not only very high stiffness but also
   very high damping leading to an ``ideal{''} combination of properties
   for a variety of structural applications. In this paper, a finite
   element based study has been presented to predict the mechanical
   stiffness and damping of such composites. It has been shown that
   reducing the thickness of the viscous polymer layer not only increases
   the stiffness of such composites but also improves the damping. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A new finite element to seamlessly model the transition from a continuum
   to a non-continuum (through fracture) is introduced in this paper,
   motivated by the variational multi-scale cohesive (VMCM) method.
   In-plane fiber-matrix fracture (also referred to as splitting) is
   frequently observed in tensile failure of fiber reinforced polymer
   matrix composites (FRPCs). By considering a single lamina, this
   mechanism is modeled through the development of a continuum-decohesive
   finite element (CDFE). In the CDFE method, the transition from a
   continuum to a non-continuum is modeled directly (physically) without
   resorting to enrichment of the shape functions of the element, as is
   done in other methods, such as the VMCM or through nodal enrichment, as
   is done with the extended finite element method (XFEM). The CDFE is a
   natural merger between cohesive elements and continuum elements. The
   predictions of the CDFE method were found to be in very good agreement
   with corresponding experimental data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Novel Scaling Laws for the Langmuir-Blodgett Solutions in Cylindrical
   and Spherical Diodes}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{26}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{It is found that the Langmuir-Blodgett solutions for the space charge
   limited current density, for both cylindrical and spherical diodes, may
   be approximated by J(app) = (4/9)epsilon(0)root(2e/m)(E-c(3/2)/root D)
   over a wide range of parameters, where E-c is the surface electric field
   on the cathode of the vacuum diode and D is the anode-cathode spacing.
   This dependence is valid whether R-a/R-c is greater than or less than
   unity, where R-a and R-c are, respectively, the anode and cathode
   radius. Minor empirical corrections to the above scaling yield fitting
   formulas that are accurate to within 5\% for 3 x 10(-5) < R-c/R-a < 500.
   An explanation of this scaling is given. An accurate transit time model
   yields the Langmuir-Blodgett solutions even in the Coulomb blockade
   regime for a nanogap, where the electron number may be in the single
   digits, and the transit time frequency is in the THz range.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and robust scheme is proposed for the fabrication of nanoscale

   properties of the new epoxy resists were controlled by adjusting the
   ratio of bisphenol F-type epoxy resin and acrylonitrile-butadiene
   rubber-based epoxy resin in the formulation of the resist. The
   mechanical properties of the resist were tuned to obtain various aspect
   ratios as well as mold flexibility for conformal contact over non-planar
   surfaces and large areas. In order to reduce the line width of the
   imprinted patterns, a process to conformally coat the mold structure by
   atomic layer deposition of alumina was also developed. Narrow lines with
   high-aspect-ratio features and with very low defect density were
   achieved via the new approach and the high mechanical strength of the

Abstract = {{The segmental dynamics of a low glass transition temperature T-g polymer
   under different conditions of morphological confinement are shown to
   manifest the influence of the frustration of the local ``packing{''} of
   chain segments at interfaces of varying curvatures, unique to the
   morphology. Of particular interest are the polyisoprene (PI) segmental
   dynamics in polystyrene-b-polyisoprene (PS-b-PI) micelles and in layered
   onion-like structures in high T-g, ``frozen,{''} polystyrene (PS) hosts.
   At temperatures close to the T-g of PI domains, the segmental relaxation
   times of PI chains in the micellar structures, tau(micelle), are more
   than 1 order of magnitude shorter than those of PI chains in the
   onion-likestructures, tau(onion). These rates are appreciably faster
   than those of homopolymer PI and of PI in the neat copolymers possessing
   lamellar and gyroid phases, tau(homo) similar to 0.5 tau(lam) similar to
   0.5 tau(gyroid), respectively. At high temperatures tau(homo) similar to
   tau(lam) similar to tau(gyroid) similar to tau(onion) similar to

Abstract = {{This study addresses the formulation of nonlinear feedback controllers
   for stochastically excited vibratory energy harvesters. Maximizing the
   average power generated from such systems requires the transducer
   current to be regulated using a bi-directional power electronic
   converter. There are many applications where the implementation of these
   types of converters is infeasible, due to the higher parasitic losses
   they must sustain. If instead the transducer current is regulated using
   a converter capable of single-directional power-flow, then these
   parasitic losses can be reduced significantly. However, the constraint
   on the power-flow directionality restricts the domain of feasible
   feedback laws. The only feasible linear feedback law imposes a static
   relationship between current and voltage, i.e., a static admittance. In
   stochastic response, the power generation performance can be enhanced
   significantly beyond that of the optimal static admittance, using
   nonlinear feedback. In this paper, a general approach to nonlinear
   control synthesis for power-flow-constrained energy harvesters is
   presented, which is analytically guaranteed to outperform the optimal
   static admittance in stationary stochastic response. Simulation results
   are presented for a single-degree-of-freedom resonant oscillator with an
   electromagnetic transducer, as well as for a piezoelectric bimorph
   cantilever beam. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate modeling of the high strain-rate response of healthy human knee
   cartilage is critical to investigating the mechanism(s) of knee
   osteoarthritis and other cartilage disorders. Osteoarthritis has been
   suggested to originate from regional shifts in joint loading during
   walking and other high strain-rate physical activities. Tibial plateau
   cartilage under compression rates analogous to walking exhibits a
   non-linear and location-dependent mechanical response. A constitutive
   model of cartilage that efficiently predicts the non-linear and
   non-uniform high strain-rate mechanics of tibial plateau cartilage is
   important for computational studies of osteoarthritis development. A
   transversely isotropic hyperelastic statistical chain model has been
   developed. The models ability to simulate the 1-strain/s unconfined
   compression response of healthy human tibial plateau articular cartilage
   has been assessed, along with two other hyperelastic statistical chain
   models. The transversely isotropic model exhibited a superior fit to the
   non-linear stress-strain response of the cartilage. Furthermore, the
   model maintained its predictive capability after being reduced from four
   degrees of freedom to one. The remaining material constant of the model,
   which represented the local collagen density of the tissue, demonstrated
   a regional dependence in close agreement with physiological variations
   in collagen density and cartilage modulus in human knees. The
   transversely isotropic eight-chain network of freely jointed chains with
   a regionally-dependent material constant represents a novel and
   efficient approach for modeling the complex response of human tibial
   cartilage under high strain-rate compression. The anisotropy and
   microstructural variations of the cartilage matrix dictate the model's
   response, rendering it directly applicable to computational modeling of
   the human knee. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, biodiesel fuels, consisting of long-chain alkyl
   (methyl, ethyl, propyl) esters, have emerged as viable alternatives to
   petroleum-based fuels. From a combustion chemistry standpoint, there is
   great interest in developing accurate reaction models for these new
   molecules that can be used to predict their behaviors in various
   regimes. In this paper, we report a detailed study of the unimolecular
   decomposition pathways of methyl butanoate (MB), a short-chain ester
   that contains the basic chemical structure of biodiesel fuels. Using ab
   initio/DFT methods, we identified five homolytic fissions of C-C and C-O
   bonds and five hydrogen transfer reactions. Rate constants were
   determined using the G3B3 theory coupled with both variational
   transition state theory and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus/rnaster
   equation simulations with hindered rotation corrections. Branching
   ratios in the temperature range 1500-2200 K indicate that the main
   pathway for thermal decomposition of MB is the reaction
   CH3CH2CH2C(=O)OCH3 -> C2H5 + CH2C(=O)OCH3. The results, in terms of
   reaction pathways and rate constants, can be used for future development
   of mechanisms for long alkyl-chain esters.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in iterative reconstruction (IR) as a
   key tool to improve quality and increase applicability of x-ray CT
   imaging. IR has the ability to significantly reduce patient dose; it
   provides the flexibility to reconstruct images from arbitrary x-ray
   system geometries and allows one to include detailed models of photon
   transport and detection physics to accurately correct for a wide variety
   of image degrading effects. This paper reviews discretization issues and
   modelling of finite spatial resolution, Compton scatter in the scanned
   object, data noise and the energy spectrum. The widespread
   implementation of IR with a highly accurate model-based correction,
   however, still requires significant effort. In addition, new hardware
   will provide new opportunities and challenges to improve CT with new
   modelling.}},

Abstract = {{In organic liquid scintillators, the energy distribution of neutrons is
   indirectly measured by characterizing the pulse height distribution of
   light output produced through nuclear reactions within the detectors.
   However, the complexity of the light generation on these detectors makes
   simulating their response difficult with standard Monte Carlo
   techniques. This paper presents the response of 7.62-cm-long X
   7.62-cm-diameter and 12.7-cm-long X 12.7-cm-diameter EJ-309 liquid
   scintillators, simulated using the Geant4 and MCNPX-PoliMi Monte Carlo
   codes. The simulations are restricted to the neutron transport and
   interaction models. Monoenergetic neutrons as well as fission neutrons
   emitted by a Cf-252 spontaneous fission source are used in these
   simulations. The energy deposition of neutrons in organic liquid
   scintillators is dependent upon their collisions with hydrogen and
   carbon nuclei; therefore simulating neutron collisions on an
   event-by-event basis is important to generate neutron pulse height
   distributions. There are no default physics models in Geant4 hence
   proper selection of physics models is required for accurate simulation.
   In this paper, we compare Geant4 (ver. 4.9.5) and MCNPX-PoliMi (ver.
   2.0) neutron pulse height distributions. The simulations are validated
   with time-of-flight (TOF) measurements obtained with 12.7-cm-long X
   12.7-cm-diameter EJ-309 detectors. Results show that both Geant4- and
   MCNPX-PoliMi-generated distributions are in good agreement with the
   measured data. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{On the energy-delay trade-off in geographic forwarding in always-on

Abstract = {{The design and development of multi-hop wireless sensor networks are
   guided by the specific requirements of their corresponding sensing
   applications. These requirements can be associated with certain
   well-defined qualitative and/or quantitative performance metrics, which
   are application-dependent. The main function of this type of network is
   to monitor a field of interest using the sensing capability of the
   sensors, collect the corresponding sensed data, and forward it to a data
   gathering point, also known as sink. Thus, the longevity of wireless
   sensor networks requires that the load of data forwarding be balanced
   among all the sensor nodes so they,deplete their battery power (or
   energy) slowly and uniformly. However, some sensing applications are
   time-critical in nature. Hence, they should satisfy strict delay
   constraints so the sink can receive the sensed data originated from the
   sensors within a specified time bound. Thus, to account for all of these
   various sensing applications, appropriate data forwarding protocols
   should be designed to achieve some or all of the following three major
   goals, namely minimum energy consumption, uniform battery power
   depletion, and minimum delay. To this end, it is necessary to jointly
   consider these three goals by formulating a multi-objective optimization
   problem and solving it. In this paper, we propose a data forwarding
   protocol that trades off these three goals via slicing the communication
   range of the sensors into concentric circular bands. In particular, we
   discuss an approach, called weighted scale-uniform-unit sum, which is
   used by the source sensors to solve this multi-objective optimization
   problem. Our proposed data forwarding protocol, called Trade-off Energy
   with Delay (TED), makes use of our solution to this multi-objective
   optimization problem in order to find a ``best{''} trade-off of minimum
   energy consumption, uniform battery power depletion, and minimum delay.
   Then, we present and discuss several numerical results to show the
   effectiveness of TED. Moreover, we show how to relax several widely used
   assumptions in order to enhance the practicality of our TED protocol,
   and extend it to real-world network scenarios. Finally, we evaluate the
   performance of TED through extensive simulations. We find that TED is
   near optimal with respect to the energy x delay metric. This simulation
   study is an essential step to gain more insight into TED before
   implementing it using a sensor test-bed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We have investigated the formation of embedded nanocrystals (NCs) in

   by rapid thermal annealing (RTA). During irradiation, redeposition is
   enhanced by developing side walls, leading to enhanced near-surface
   {[}Ga] and {[}Si]. Subsequent RTA leads to the formation of Si and Ga
   NCs embedded in SiNx. When the ratio of the irradiated area to the
   sidewall area is increased, redeposition is limited, and SiNx and GaN
   NCs are also apparent. We discuss the effect of limited redeposition on
   NC formation and the catalytic effect of Ga on Si NC nucleation and
   growth. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   similar to what was recently used for bio-detection and for field
   enhancement. We demonstrate our solver by parametrically studying a
   toroid-nanoplasmonic device and get the optimal nano-plasmonic size for
   maximal enhancement. We investigate cases near a plasmonic resonance as
   well as far from a plasmonic resonance. Unlike common plasmons that
   typically benefit from working near their resonance, here working far
   from plasmonic resonance provides comparable performance. This is
   because the plasmonic resonance enhancement is accompanied by cavity
   quality degradation through plasmonic absorption. (C) 2013 Optical

Abstract = {{Although several recent studies have reported that GPCRs adopt multiple
   conformations, it remains unclear how subtle conformational changes are
   translated into divergent downstream responses. In this study, we report
   on a novel class of FRET-based sensors that can detect the
   ligand/mutagenic stabilization of GPCR conformations that promote
   interactions with G proteins in live cells. These sensors rely on the
   well characterized interaction between a GPCR and the C terminus of a G
   alpha subunit. We use these sensors to elucidate the influence of the
   highly conserved (E/D) RY motif on GPCR conformation. Specifically,
   Glu/Asp but not Arg mutants of the (E/D) RY motif are known to enhance
   basal GPCR signaling. Hence, it is unclear whether ionic interactions
   formed by the (E/D) RY motif ( ionic lock) are necessary to stabilize
   basal GPCR states. We find that mutagenesis of the beta 2-AR (E/D) RY
   ionic lock enhances interaction with G(s). However, only Glu/Asp but not
   Arg mutants increase G protein activation. In contrast, mutagenesis of
   the opsin (E/D) RY ionic lock does not alter its interaction with
   transducin. Instead, opsin-specific ionic interactions centered on
   residue Lys-296 are both necessary and sufficient to promote
   interactions with transducin. Effective suppression of beta 2-AR basal
   activity by inverse agonist ICI 118,551 requires ionic interactions
   formed by the (E/D) RY motif. In contrast, the inverse agonist
   metoprolol suppresses interactions with G(s) and promotes G(i) binding,
   with concomitant pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of adenylyl
   cyclase activity. Taken together, these studies validate the use of the
   new FRET sensors while revealing distinct structural mechanisms for
   ligand-dependent GPCR function.}},

Abstract = {{Micropatterning of bacteria using aqueous two phase system (ATPS)
   enables the localized culture and formation of physically separated
   bacterial communities on human epithelial cell sheets. This method was
   used to compare the effects of Escherichia coli strain MG1655 and an
   isogenic invasive counterpart that expresses the invasin (inv) gene from
   Yersinia pseudotuberculosis on the underlying epithelial cell layer.
   Large portions of the cell layer beneath the invasive strain were killed
   or detached while the non-invasive E. coli had no apparent effect on the
   epithelial cell layer over a 24 h observation period. In addition,
   simultaneous testing of the localized effects of three different
   bacterial species; E. coli MG1655, Shigella boydii KACC 10792 and
   Pseudomonas sp DSM 50906 on an epithelial cell layer is also
   demonstrated. The paper further shows the ability to use a bacterial
   predator, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus HD 100, to selectively remove the
   E. coli, S. boydii and P. sp communities from this bacteria-patterned
   epithelial cell layer. Importantly, predation and removal of the P. Sp
   was critical for maintaining viability of the underlying epithelial
   cells. Although this paper focuses on a few specific cell types, the
   technique should be broadly applicable to understand a variety of
   bacteria-epithelial cell interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Heparin decomplexation experiments, as well as all-atom (AA) and
   coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, were performed
   to determine the effect of the size of arginine(Arg)-rich peptides on
   the structure and binding strength of the siRNA peptide complex. At a
   fixed peptide/siRNA mole ratio of 5:1 or 10:1, the siRNA complexes with
   peptides longer than nine Arg residues are more easily decomplexed by
   heparin than are those with nine Arg residues. At these mole ratios,
   peptides longer than nine Arg residues have cationic/anionic charge
   ratios in excess of unity, and produce more weakly bound complexes than
   nine Arg residue ones do. AA simulations of mixtures of peptides with a
   single siRNA show formation of an electrostatically induced complex, and
   the longer peptides produce a larger complex, but with no significant
   increase in the number of Arg residues bound to the siRNA. Larger-scale
   CG-MD simulations show that multiple siRNAs can be linked together by
   peptides into a large complex, as observed in the experiments. The
   peptides longer than nine residues, which at mole ratio 5:1 yield a
   peptide/siRNA charge ratio in excess of unity, include many
   noninteracting Arg residues, which repel each other electrostatically.
   This leads to a less dense complex than for 9-residue peptides, which
   can explain why these longer complexes are more easily decomplexed by
   heparin molecules, as observed in the experiments. The key role of the
   charge ratio is supported by simulations that show that, at a mole ratio
   of 2.5 peptides per siRNA, the longer 18-residue peptide has a charge
   ratio of roughly unity and also shows a tight complex, just as the
   9-residue peptide does at a 5:1 mole ratio, where its charge ratio is
   also unity.}},

Title = {{Heat dissipation in atomic-scale junctions}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},

Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Atomic and single-molecule junctions represent the ultimate limit to the
   miniaturization of electrical circuits(1). They are also ideal platforms
   for testing quantum transport theories that are required to describe
   charge and energy transfer in novel functional nano-metre-scale devices.
   Recent work has successfully probed electric and thermoelectric
   phenomena(2-8) in atomic-scale junctions. However, heat dissipation and
   transport in atomic-scale devices remain poorly characterized owing to
   experimental challenges. Here we use custom-fabricated scanning probes
   with integrated nanoscale thermocouples to investigate heat dissipation
   in the electrodes of single-molecule ('molecular') junctions. We find
   that if the junctions have transmission characteristics that are
   strongly energy dependent, this heat dissipation is asymmetric-that is,
   unequal between the electrodes-and also dependent on both the bias
   polarity and the identity of the majority charge carriers (electrons
   versus holes). In contrast, junctions consisting of only a few gold
   atoms ('atomic junctions') whose transmission characteristics show weak
   energy dependence do not exhibit appreciable asymmetry. Our results
   unambiguously relate the electronic transmission characteristics of
   atomic-scale junctions to their heat dissipation properties,
   establishing a framework for understanding heat dissipation in a range
   of mesoscopic systems where transport is elastic-that is, without
   exchange of energy in the contact region. We anticipate that the
   techniques established here will enable the study of Peltier effects at
   the atomic scale, a field that has been barely explored experimentally
   despite interesting theoretical predictions(9-11). Furthermore, the
   experimental advances described here are also expected to enable the
   study of heat transport in atomic and molecular junctions-an important
   and challenging scientific and technological goal that has remained
   elusive(12,13).}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a comprehensive atomistic simulation study of the adhesive
   properties of aromatic rigid rod poly-{[}(4,4'diphenylene)
   pyromellitimide] on a dimer-reconstructed silicon surface. We describe
   the structural developments within the adherent's interfacial region at
   the atomistic scale, and evaluate the energetics of the adhesive
   interactions between bimaterial constituents. In particular, we observe
   a transition between noncontact and contact adhesion, regimes as a
   function of the interfacial bonding strength between the polyimide
   repeat units and the silicon substrate. This transition is manifest by a
   three- to four-fold increase in adhesive energy, which is entirely
   attributable to structural relaxation in the organic layer near the
   interface, revealing the importance of accurately describing structural
   details at interfaces for reliable interfacial strength predictions. The
   underlying molecular reconfigurations in the pyromellitimide layer
   include preferred orientation of the rigid rod molecules, molecular
   stacking, ordering, and the local densification. The role of each of
   these factors in the adhesive behavior is analyzed and.. conclusively
   described. Where possible, simulation results are compared with

Abstract = {{Focal adhesions mediate force transfer between ECM-integrin complexes
   and the cytoskeleton. Although vinculin has been implicated in force
   transmission, few direct measurements have been made, and there is
   little mechanistic insight. Using vinculin-null cells expressing
   vinculin mutants, we demonstrate that vinculin is not required for
   transmission of adhesive and traction forces but is necessary for myosin
   contractility-dependent adhesion strength and traction force and for the
   coupling of cell area and traction force. Adhesion strength and traction
   forces depend differentially on vinculin head (V-H) and tail domains.
   V-H enhances adhesion strength by increasing ECM-bound integrin-talin
   complexes, independently from interactions with vinculin tail ligands
   and contractility. A full-length, autoinhibition-deficient mutant (T12)
   increases adhesion strength compared with V-H, implying roles for both
   vinculin activation and the actin-binding tail. In contrast to adhesion
   strength, vinculin-dependent traction forces absolutely require a
   full-length and activated molecule; V-H has no effect. Physical linkage
   of the head and tail domains is required for maximal force responses.
   Residence times of vinculin in focal adhesions, but not T12 or V-H,
   correlate with applied force, supporting a mechanosensitive model for
   vinculin activation in which forces stabilize vinculin's active
   conformation to promote force transfer.}},

Title = {{Role of Environmental and Antibiotic Stress on Staphylococcus
   epidermidis Biofilm Microstructure}},

Abstract = {{Cellular clustering and separation of Staphylococcus epidermidis surface
   adherent biofilms were found to depend significantly on both antibiotic
   and environmental stress present during growth under steady flow. Image
   analysis techniques common to colloidal science were applied to image
   volumes acquired with high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy
   to extract spatial positions of individual bacteria in volumes of size
   similar to 30 X 30 X 15 mu m(3). The local number density, cluster
   distribution, and radial distribution function were determined at each
   condition by analyzing the statistics of the bacterial spatial
   positions. Environmental I stressors of high osmotic pressure (776 mM
   NaCl) and sublethal antibiotic dose (1.9 mu g/mL vancomycin) decreased
   the average bacterial local number density 10-fold. Device-associated
   bacterial biofilms are frequently exposed to these environmental and
   antibiotic stressors while undergoing flow in the bloodstream.
   Characteristic density phenotypes associated with low, medium, and high
   local number densities were identified in unstressed S. epidermidis
   biofilms, while stressed biofilms contained medium- and low-density
   phenotypes. All biofilms exhibited clustering at length scales
   commensurate with cell division (similar to 1.0 mu m). However, density
   phenotypes differed in cellular connectivity at the scale of similar to
   6 mu m. On this scale, nearly all cells in the high- and medium-density
   phenotypes were connected into a single cluster with a structure
   characteristic of a densely packed disordered fluid. However, in the
   low-density phenotype, the number of clusters was greater, equal to 4\%
   of the total number of cells, and structures were fractal in nature with
   d(f) = 1.7 +/- 0.1. The work advances the understanding of biofilm
   growth, informs the development of predictive models of transport and
   mechanical properties of biofilms, and provides a method for quantifying
   the kinetics of bacterial surface colonization as well as biofilm
   fracture and fragmentation.}},

Title = {{Chiral plasmonics of self-assembled nanorod dimers}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{Chiral nanoscale photonic systems typically follow either tetrahedral or
   helical geometries that require four or more different constituent
   nanoparticles. Smaller number of particles and different chiral
   geometries taking advantage of the self-organization capabilities of
   nanomaterials will advance understanding of chiral plasmonic effects,
   facilitate development of their theory, and stimulate practical
   applications of chiroplasmonics. Here we show that gold nanorods
   self-assemble into side-by-side orientated pairs and ``ladders'' in
   which chiral properties originate from the small dihedral angle between
   them. Spontaneous twisting of one nanorod versus the other one breaks
   the centrosymmetric nature of the parallel assemblies. Two possible
   enantiomeric conformations with positive and negative dihedral angles
   were obtained with different assembly triggers. The chiral nature of the
   angled nanorod pairs was confirmed by 4 pi full space simulations and
   the first example of single-particle CD spectroscopy. Self-assembled
   nanorod pairs and ``ladders'' enable the development of chiral
   metamaterials, (bio) sensors, and new catalytic processes.}},

Abstract = {{An analytic multi-dimensional dynamic model of a membrane type
   humidifier has been developed for the study of transient responses of
   the humidifier under proton exchange membrane fuel cell vehicle
   operating conditions. The dynamic responses of heat and mass transfer
   and fluid flow in a membrane humidifier are mathematically formulated
   and modeled with a newly developed pseudo-multi-dimensional concept. The
   model is used to analyze the performance of the humidifier under various
   operating conditions and the dynamic response of the humidifier under
   transient operating conditions. The simulation results show that, in the
   case of the water-to-gas type membrane humidifier modeled in this study,
   the time constant of water diffusion in the membrane is less than 1 s.
   Thus, the delay of the response of the humidifier induced by the vapor
   diffusion in the membrane is not significant in vehicle operation.
   However, it is also found that the dynamic behavior is mainly due to the
   thermal resistance and heat capacity of the membrane humidifier.

Abstract = {{We develop a framework to understand the performance of tandem organic
   photovoltaic (OPV) cells consisting of a series-connected stack of an
   arbitrary number of sub-cells. The power conversion efficiency penalty,
   Delta(n), is defined as the loss incurred when the tandem cell is at its
   maximum power point (MPP) but one or more sub-cells are not operating at
   their individual MPPs. To minimize Delta(n), the current at the MPP for
   each sub-cell must be equal. We also develop a method to calculate the
   tandem cell spectral mismatch factor and fill factor, showing that they
   are related to both the fill factors and short circuit currents of all
   the constituent sub-cells. By including the current generated in the
   dark, exciton dissociation at the donor-acceptor heterojunction, and
   photoconductivity, along with current losses due to polaron-pair and
   bimolecular recombination, we simulate the operation of small molecule
   bilayer and mixed-layer sub-cells used in the tandem, and from these
   results derive the behavior of the integrated device. This analysis is
   used to understand and optimize tandem OPV cell performance. (C) 2013

Title = {{A Novel Role of Three Dimensional Graphene Foam to Prevent Heater
   Failure during Boiling}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{We report a novel boiling heat transfer (NBHT) in reduced graphene oxide
   (RGO) suspended in water (RGO colloid) near critical heat flux (CHF),
   which is traditionally the dangerous limitation of nucleate boiling heat
   transfer because of heater failure. When the heat flux reaches the
   maximum value (CHF) in RGO colloid pool boiling, the wall temperature
   increases gradually and slowly with an almost constant heat flux,
   contrary to the rapid wall temperature increase found during water pool
   boiling. The gained time by NBHT would provide the safer margin of the
   heat transfer and the amazing impact on the thermal system as the first
   report of graphene application. In addition, the CHF and boiling heat

Abstract = {{The one-shot success probability of a noisy classical channel for
   transmitting one classical bit is the optimal probability with which the
   bit can be successfully sent via a single use of the channel. Prevedel
   et al. {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 110505 (2011)] recently showed that for
   a specific channel, this quantity can be increased if the parties using
   the channel share an entangled quantum state. In this paper, we
   characterize the optimal entanglement-assisted protocols in terms of the
   radius of a set of operators associated with the channel. This
   characterization can be used to construct optimal entanglement-assisted
   protocols for a given classical channel and to prove the limits of such
   protocols. As an example, we show that the Prevedel et al. protocol is
   optimal for two-qubit entanglement. We also prove some tight upper
   bounds on the improvement that can be obtained from quantum and
   nonsignaling correlations.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{This paper seeks to make joint decisions on preventive maintenance level
   and production quantity for manufacturing systems subject to stochastic
   demand in a finite-horizon. Standard models for scheduling preventive
   maintenance typically ignore the throughput target variation due to
   demand uncertainty and specify instead a constant demand rate. We show
   that maintenance decisions should be integrated with production
   decisions to accommodate the demand uncertainty. To achieve this
   objective, preventive maintenance (PM) flexibility is introduced as the
   opportunity to select and implement maintenance tasks at different
   levels, which can be viewed as real options to the manufacturer. PM
   levels can be defined according to the degree to which the machine
   condition is stored by maintenance. A preventive maintenance can be a
   minimal, imperfect, or perfect one. By leveraging PM flexibility, this
   paper proposes a model to determine optimal production quantity and PM
   level for a single-product manufacturing system with a finite planning
   horizon. A real option analysis (ROA) is developed to quantify the
   benefits and costs of PM flexibility. We derive optimal joint decisions
   for maintenance and production that maximize the overall expected profit
   of the system. We compare the proposed PM-flexible model with the
   conventional PM-fixed model in a case study. The results demonstrate the
   condition that the PM-flexible model outperforms the PM-fixed model in
   terms of option value (expected operating profits). We also show how the
   growth in demand volatility affects the optimal decisions and overall
   profitability. These results have important implications for making
   maintenance and production decisions, especially in industries that
   feature high demand volatility.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},

Abstract = {{The equipment degradation and various maintenance decision processes
   with unreliable machines have been studied extensively. The traditional
   degradation modeling using Markov process only focuses on single machine
   system and ignores maintenance or repair duration. This paper is devoted
   to analytical and numerical study of production lines within the Markov
   process framework considering repair time and periodic inspection.
   Nonexponential holding time distributions in Markov chain are
   approximated by inserting multiple intermediate states based on a
   phase-type distribution. Overall system availability is calculated by
   recursively solving the balance equations of the Markov process. The
   results show that the optimal inspection intervals for two
   repairable-machine systems can be achieved by means of the proposed
   method. By having an adequate model representing both deterioration and
   maintenance processes, it is also possible to obtain different optimal
   maintenance policies to maximize the availability or productivity for
   different configurations of components.}},

Title = {{Workpiece Temperature During Deep-Hole Drilling of Cast Iron Using High
   Air Pressure Minimum Quantity Lubrication}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This research investigates heat generation and workpiece temperature
   during deep-hole drilling of cast iron under a high air pressure minimum
   quantity lubrication (MQL). The hole wall surface (HWS) heat flux, due
   to drill margin friction and high temperature chips, is of particular
   interest in deep-hole drilling since it potentially increases the
   workpiece thermal distortion. This study advances a prior drilling model
   to quantify the effect of higher air pressure on MQL drilling of cast
   iron, which is currently performed via flood cooling. Experiments and
   numerical analysis for drilling holes 200 mm in depth on nodular cast
   iron work material with a 10 mm diameter drill were conducted. Results
   showed that the low drill penetration rate can cause intermittent chip
   clogging, resulting in tremendous heat; however this phenomenon could be
   eliminated through high air pressure or high feed and speed. Conversely,
   if the drilling process is stable without chip clogging and
   accumulation, added high air pressure is found to have no effect on heat
   generation. The heat flux though the HWS contributes over 66\% of the
   total workpiece temperature rise when intermittent chip clogging occurs,
   and around 20\% to 30\% under stable drilling conditions regardless of
   the air pressure. This paper demonstrated the significance of HWS heat
   flux and the potential of high air pressure used in conjunction with MQL
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of discharge rate and LiMn2O4 cathode
   properties (thickness, porosity, particle size, and solid-state
   diffusivity and conductivity) on the gravimetric energy and power
   density of a lithium-ion battery cell are analyzed simultaneously using
   a cell-level model. Surrogate-based analysis tools are applied to
   simulation data to construct educed-order models, which are in turn used
   to perform global sensitivity analysis to compare the relative
   importance of cathode properties. Based on these results, the cell is
   then optimized for several distinct physical scenarios using
   gradient-based methods. The complementary nature of the gradient-and
   surrogate-based tools is demonstrated by establishing proper bounds and
   constraints with the surrogate model, and then obtaining accurate
   optimized solutions with the gradient-based optimizer. These optimal
   solutions enable the quantification of the tradeoffs between energy and
   power density, and the effect of optimizing the electrode thickness and
   porosity. In conjunction with known guidelines, the numerical
   optimization framework developed herein can be applied directly to cell
   and pack design.}},

Title = {{Dual-wavelength photoacoustic technique for monitoring tissue status

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic (PA) techniques have been exploited for monitoring thermal
   treatments. However, PA signals depend not only on tissue temperature
   but also on tissue optical properties which indicate tissue status
   (e.g., native or coagulated). The changes in temperature and tissue
   status often occur simultaneously during thermal treatments, so both
   effects cause changes to PA signals. A new dual-wavelength PA technique
   to monitor tissue status independent of temperature is performed. By
   dividing the PA signal intensities obtained at two wavelengths at the
   same temperature, a ratio, which only depends on tissue optical
   properties, is obtained. Experiments were performed with two
   experimental groups, one with untreated tissue samples and the other
   with high-intensity focused ultrasound treated tissue samples including
   thermal coagulated lesion, using ex vivo porcine myocardium specimens to
   test the technique. The ratio of PA signal intensities obtained at 700
   and 800 nm was constant for both groups from 25 to 43 degrees C, but
   with distinct values for the two groups. Tissue alteration during
   thermal treatment was then studied using water bath heating of tissue
   samples from 35 to 60 degrees C. We found that the ratio stayed constant
   before it exhibited a marked increase at around 55 degrees C, indicating
   tissue changes at this temperature. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{The number of applications using high frame rate imaging in combustion
   research has grown rapidly in recent years. Enabled by continuous
   improvements in laser power, a wide range of diagnostics have been
   developed to measure velocity, species concentration, and temperature.
   Growing attention is focused on measurements near surfaces, e.g., to
   gain better insight into transient boundary layer flows in internal
   combustion engines. During such experiments, laser light is used to
   illuminate the gas phase region above the surface, but often the laser
   beam is terminated into the surface directly. Thus, laser operation at
   several kilohertz and power levels in the range of 10-100 W raise
   concerns about heating the surface and altering the conditions in the
   gas phase. In other words, the non-intrusive properties of laser
   diagnostics might not be guaranteed under such conditions. We have
   investigated the effect of heating by high repetition rate lasers by
   measuring the temperature of an exposed metal surface with an infrared
   sensor and by various simulation approaches. The current results show a
   modest but noticeable influence of laser heating.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{4818-4829}},

Abstract = {{Materials assembled by layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly and vacuum-assisted
   flocculation (VAF) have similarities, but a systematic study of their
   comparative advantages and disadvantages is missing. Such a study is
   needed from both practical and fundamental perspectives aiming at a
   better understanding of structure property relationships of
   nanocomposites and purposeful engineering of materials with unique
   properties. Layered composites from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and reduced
   graphene (RG) are made by both techniques. We comparatively evaluate
   their structure, mechanical, and electrical properties. LBL and VAF
   composites demonstrate clear differences at atomic and nanoscale
   structural levels but reveal similarities in micrometer and
   submicrometer organization. Epitaxial crystallization and suppression of
   phase transition temperatures are more pronounced for PVA in LBL than
   for VAF composites. Mechanical properties are virtually identical for
   both assemblies at high RG contents. We conclude that mechanical
   properties in layered RG assemblies are largely determined by the
   thermodynamic state of PVA at the polymer/nanosheet interface rather
   than the nanometer scale differences in RG packing. High and nearly
   Identical values of toughness for LBL and VAF composites reaching 6.1
   MJ/m(3) observed for thermodynamically optimal composition confirm this
   conclusion. Their toughness is the highest among all other layered
   assemblies from RG, cellulose, clay, etc. Electrical conductivity,
   however, is more than 10x higher for LBL than for VAF composites for the
   same RG contents. Electrical properties are largely determined by the
   tunneling barrier between RG sheets and therefore strongly dependent on
   atomic/nanoscale organization. These findings open the door for
   application-oriented methods of materials engineering using both types
   of layered assemblies.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Toluene PLIF has been applied to image temperature in supersonic
   flowfields containing shock waves. Single-and dual-camera imaging
   schemes with a single excitation wavelength (266 nm) are presented, and
   the dual-camera scheme is optimized for imaging temperature from 300 to
   900 K. The single-camera technique is implemented to verify the
   diagnostic and image temperature in uniform pressure, uniformly seeded
   flowfields; calibration is done using the signal ratio measured across
   an oblique shock wave of known Mach number. The dual-camera technique
   utilizes the redshift of toluene fluorescence with increasing
   temperature for temperature imaging in non-uniform pressure and
   temperature flowfields. Both single-and dual-camera techniques are
   verified and demonstrated by imaging the flow behind normal shock waves
   and oblique shock waves, and the dual-camera technique is further
   extended to image temperature in the non-uniform pressure and
   temperature field behind a bow shock. Good agreement is observed between
   the measured and expected temperature distributions calculated from
   ideal shock relations or CFD solutions. The accuracy of each technique
   is also evaluated; for dual-camera thermometry, SNR in temperature
   ranging from 25 at 300 K to 15 at 900 K is observed in single-shot

Abstract = {{Room-temperature polariton lasing from a GaN-dielectric rnicrocavity is

   accompanied by significant line width narrowing to 5 meV and a small
   blue shift of similar to 1 meV. The measured polariton dispersion is
   characterized by a Rabi splitting of 40 meV and a cavity exciton
   detuning of -17 meV. The device described here is a demonstration of

Abstract = {{Resistive switching devices are widely believed as a promising candidate
   for future memory and logic applications. Here we show that by using
   multilayer oxide heterostructures the switching characteristics can be
   systematically controlled, ranging from unipolar switching to
   complementary switching and bipolar switching with linear and nonlinear
   on-states and high endurance. Each layer can be tailed for a specific
   function during resistance switching, thus greatly improving the degree
   of control and flexibility for optimized device performance.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{We study the displacement flow of two Newtonian fluids in an inclined
   pipe. The fluids have the same viscosity but different densities. The
   displacing fluid is denser than the displaced fluid and is placed above
   the displaced fluid (i.e., a density-unstable configuration). Three
   dimensionless groups describe these flows: a densimetric Froude number
   Fr, a Reynolds number Re, and the pipe inclination beta. Our experiments
   cover fairly broad ranges of these parameters: 0 <= Fr <= 9; 0 <= Re
   (sic) 2400; 0 <= beta <= 85 degrees. Phenomenologically, our
   experimental flow observations vary from well mixed fully diffusive
   regimes, through buoyancy-dominated inertial exchange regimes, to
   laminar viscous flows, all with varying degrees of stability. We
   characterize the different flow regimes observed in terms of the three
   dimensionless groups and provide leading order approximations to the
   velocity of the displacement front and the macroscopic diffusion in each
   regime. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{A field and laboratory geotechnical characterization study of a
   Municipal Solid Waste Incineration Ash disposed of at the Carleton Farms
   monofill in Michigan was performed. Field characterization consisted of
   field observations, collection of four bulk samples and performance of
   shear wave velocity measurements at two locations. Laboratory
   characterization consisted of basic geotechnical characterization, i.e.,
   grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, specific gravity tests,
   compaction tests as well as moisture and organic content assessment
   followed by direct shear and triaxial shear testing. The test results of
   this investigation are compared to results in the literature. The grain
   size distribution of the samples was found to be very similar and
   consistent with the grain size distribution data available in the
   literature, but the compaction characteristics were found to vary
   significantly. Specific gravities were also lower than specific
   gravities of silicic soils. Shear strengths were higher than typically
   reported for sandy soils, even for MSWI ash specimens at a loose state.
   Strain rate was not found to impact the shear resistance. Significant
   differences in triaxial shear were observed between a dry and a
   saturated specimen not only in terms of peak shear resistance, but also
   in terms of stress-strain response. In situ shear wave velocities ranged
   from 500 to 800 m/s at a depth of about 8 m, to 1100-1200 m/s at a depth
   of 50 m. These high shear wave velocities are consistent with field
   observations indicating the formation of cemented blocks of ash with
   time, but this ``ageing{''} process in MSWI ash is still not well
   understood and additional research is needed. An improved understanding
   of the long-term behavior of MSWI ash, including the effects of moisture
   and ash chemical composition on the ageing process, as well as the
   leaching characteristics of the material, may promote unbound
   utilization of the ash in civil infrastructure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   1-D periodic dry sand surfaces. Comparison between the expected volume

   response of dry sand surfaces with rough interfaces shows that volume

Abstract = {{The sequence dependence of DNA-protein interactions that allows proteins
   to find the correct reaction site also slows down the 1D diffusion of
   the protein along the DNA molecule, leading to the so-called
   ``speed-stability paradox,{''} wherein fast diffusion along the DNA
   molecule is seemingly incompatible with stable targeting of the reaction
   site. Here, we develop diffusion-reaction models that use discrete and
   continuous Gaussian random 1D diffusion landscapes with or without a
   high-energy cut-off, and two-state models with a transition to and from
   a ``searching{''} mode in which the protein diffuses rapidly without
   recognizing the target. We show the conditions under which such
   considerations lead to a predicted speed-up of the targeting process,
   and under which the presence of a ``searching{''} mode in a two-state
   model is nearly equivalent to the existence of a high-energy cut-off in
   a one-state model. We also determine the conditions under which the
   search is either diffusion-limited or reaction-limited, and develop
   quantitative expressions for the rate of successful targeting as a
   function of the site-specific reaction rate, the roughness of the
   DNA-protein interaction potential, and the presence of a ``searching{''}
   mode. In general, we find that a rough landscape is compatible with a
   fast search if the highest energy barriers can be avoided by
   ``hopping{''} or by the protein transitioning to a lower-energy
   ``searching{''} mode. We validate these predictions with the results of
   Brownian dynamics, kinetic Metropolis, and kinetic Monte Carlo
   simulations of the diffusion and targeting process, and apply these
   concepts to the case of T7 RNA polymerase searching for its target site
   on T7 DNA.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a real-time monocular visual simultaneous

   The proposed algorithm overcomes some of the specific challenges

   imagery and feature-poor regions. It does so by exploiting our SLAM
   navigation prior within the image registration pipeline and by being
   selective about which imagery is considered informative in terms of our
   visual SLAM map. A novel online bag-of-words measure for intra and
   interimage saliency are introduced and are shown to be useful for image
   key-frame selection, information-gain-based link hypothesis, and novelty
   detection. Results from three real-world hull inspection experiments

Abstract = {{The response of a material to a high radiation field is important when
   selecting materials for nuclear applications, such as structural
   materials, nuclear waste forms and inert matrix fuels. In the present
   study, the radiation response of orthorhombic, rare-earth titanates,
   Ln(2)TiO(5) (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy and Y), was investigated by 1 MeV
   Kr2+ ion bombardment at temperatures ranging from 50 to 1073 K. In situ
   transmission electron microscopy revealed that the radiation tolerance
   and irradiation-induced structural transitions vary largely with
   composition. Y2TiO5 exhibits the lowest critical amorphization
   temperature (T-c = 623 K), above which crystals cannot be amorphized,
   which is consistent with its use in the form of nanoclusters in
   radiation-resistant oxide-dispersion-strengthened steels. The disordered
   fluorite structure type of Ln(2)TiO(5), with smaller Ln cations, formed
   as an intermediate phase prior to becoming fully amorphous. The fluorite
   structure type of Ln(2)TiO(5), containing more vacancies as compared
   with that of Ln(2)Ti(2)O(7), may exhibit enhanced ionic conductivity,
   which highlights an effective way of using ion beams to modify the
   properties of materials. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Closed-form stress intensity factor solutions for spot welds in square
   overlap parts of cross-tension specimens are investigated in this paper.
   The opposite outer edges of the square overlap parts of cross-tension
   specimens are under combined opening and counter bending conditions. The
   closed-form analytical structural stress solutions for a rigid inclusion
   in a square plate under the combined opening and counter bending
   conditions are first reviewed. Then, the J integral and stress intensity
   factor solutions for spot welds between square plates of different
   thicknesses and materials under the combined opening and counter bending
   conditions are developed in terms of the closed-form structural stress
   solutions for a strip model. The results of three-dimensional finite
   element analyses for spot welds between square plates of different
   thicknesses and materials under the combined opening and counter bending
   conditions are then presented. The analytical stress intensity factor
   solutions at the critical locations for spot welds based on the
   structural stress solutions with the equivalent and fitting coefficients
   are compared with the computational results. The results indicate that
   the computational stress intensity factor solutions agree well with
   those based on the structural stress solutions with only the equivalent
   coefficients. Based on the closed-form structural stress solutions,
   complete sets of the normalized in-plane stress intensity factor
   solutions at the critical locations of spot welds in square overlap
   parts of cross-tension specimens as functions of the ratio of the plate
   width to the spot weld diameter are presented for combinations of steel,
   aluminum and magnesium sheets and combinations of aluminum and copper
   sheets for convenient engineering applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Predictive biomechanical analysis of manual material handling (MMH)
   transfers is dependent on accurate prediction of foot locations relative
   to the task. Previous studies have classified common acyclic stepping
   patterns used during those transfer tasks, but the influence of walking
   distance prior to the transfer is not well understood. Twenty men and
   women performed transfers for a minimum of six different delivery
   distance conditions. The number of steps used by the participants ranged
   from two to seven. A theoretical framework for idealised step-scaling
   strategies is proposed and compared with the experimental data. The
   maximum observed increase in step length prior to delivery was 1.43
   times the nominal step length calculated for each participant. The data
   suggest that although participants can scale their steps to facilitate
   the use of a single terminal stance at the transfer, the majority of
   participants chose to utilise a combination of stepping strategies if
   the preferred contralateral lead foot strategy could not be easily
   implemented.
   Practitioner summary: Accurate foot placements are needed for predictive
   biomechanical analysis of MMH. A laboratory study investigated the
   influence of previous step positions on MMH. A flexible step-scaling
   strategy, in which step lengths and strategy were varied, suggests that
   analysis based on simulated movements should consider multiple lifting
   postures.}},

Abstract = {{Several compositions of the p-type half-Heusler alloys
   Zr0.5Hf0.5Co0.4Rh0.6Sb1-xSnx (0 <= x <= 0.4) were synthesized by
   mechanically alloying high purity elemental powders using hardened steel
   jars and balls on a high energy shaker mill. Powder X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) investigations of several aliquots taken after regularly spaced
   milling time suggested that single phase products with half-Heusler (HH)
   structure can be obtained after 10 h. However, XRD and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) studies of several specimens obtained from
   compacted polycrystalline powders of Zr0.5Hf0.5Co0.4Rh0.6Sb1-xSnx alloys
   using a uniaxial hot press (HP) revealed the presence of CoSb inclusions
   with various sizes embedded inside the HH matrix. Hall effect,
   electrical conductivity, and thermopower data collected between 300 K
   and 775 K on several compositions suggested that electronic transport in
   the synthesized Zr0.5Hf0.5Co0.4Rh0.6Sb1-xSnx/CoSb composites strongly
   depends on the average size and/or mole fraction of the embedded CoSb
   inclusions rather than the fraction (x) of Sn substituting for Sb. Among
   the samples investigated, the nanocomposite with x=0.2, which contains
   nanometer-scale CoSb inclusions, showed the largest power factor (800 mu
   W/K-2 m at 775 K) and the lowest lattice thermal conductivity (similar
   to 2.2 W/m K at 775 K) leading to a six-fold enhancement in the figure
   of merit when compared to the Zr0.5Hf0.5Co0.4Rh0.6Sb0.99Sn0.01 bulk

Abstract = {{Optimization of a `smart' product requires optimizing the design of both
   the physical system, or artifact, and its controller. If the artifact
   and control optimization are coupled, then a combined approach is
   typically used in order to produce optimal solutions. The combined
   approach presents certain disadvantages, however. This combined approach
   obviates a natural decomposition of the problem into smaller design and
   control sub-problems that can be a disadvantage from a modeling and
   solution practicality viewpoint. In this paper, it is shown that a
   modified sequential approach utilizing a Control Proxy Function (CPF)
   can be used to produce optimal, or near-optimal, solutions while
   allowing this decomposition. Two physical bases for CPFs are presented,
   natural frequency and the controllability Gramrnian matrix, and their
   range of applicability is discussed. These concepts are demonstrated,
   for a positioning gantry example and on an active/passive automotive
   suspension, to be quite effective. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In support of the conversion of the Oregon State TRIGA Reactor (OSTR)
   from highly enriched uranium (HE U) fuel to low-enriched uranium (LEU)
   fuel, a comprehensive neutronic analysis utilizing MCNP5 was performed
   on the HEU and LEU core configurations. The initial 1974 HEU core
   provided an opportunity for verification of the MCNP5 baseline model;
   all fuel elements in the initial core were congruent in geometry and
   material composition, having no burnup. In addition, a substantial
   database of core parameters was documented during the initial HEU core
   start-up. This verification study examined control rod worth, core
   excess reactivity, burnup, core power, power per element, temperature
   coefficient of reactivity, void coefficient of reactivity, moderator
   coefficient of reactivity, axial and radial power profiles,
   prompt-neutron lifetime, effective delayed-neutron fraction, power
   defect, and xenon poisoning.
   Fuel material composition and core loadings are presented. The excellent
   comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data of
   the initial HEU core established an objective, credible baseline model
   and methodology, which were then extended to the LEU core neutronic
   analysis. Comparison between the numerically calculated core physics
   values for the new LEU core and data collected during start-up provided
   a complete verification that the MCNP5 models developed for both the HEU
   and LEU cores were representative of the OSTR.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic excitation is among the many possible factors contributing to
   slope failures. Typical design of slopes and analyses of existing slopes
   are carried out assuming plane strain mechanisms of deformation, and
   replacing the seismic loading with a uniformly distributed static force.
   A three-dimensional (3D) analysis of slopes is described in this paper,
   based on the kinematic theorem of limit analysis. Critical acceleration
   is calculated for 3D slope failures, and an analysis of a rotating block
   is executed to develop a solution for displacements of slopes subjected
   to seismic shaking. The emphasis is more on applying the displacement
   analysis to a 3D collapse pattern, and less on the choice of ground
   motion records suitable for the 3D failure analysis of slopes. The
   analysis is applicable to slopes for which the geometry of the failure
   pattern is physically confined, as for instance, in the case of
   excavations. A 3D failure pattern is then expected, and the results of
   calculations are given for a reasonable range of the
   width-to-slope-height ratios. The method is illustrated with practical
   examples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel antenna architecture to achieve an extremely
   small form factor for HF band applications. The approach is based on
   manipulating the topology of a short monopole antenna without utilizing
   a high index material. A new architecture incorporating two radiating
   elements is configured, which allows significant gain enhancement. It is
   shown that such architecture can render a miniaturized HF antenna on air
   substrate having lateral and height dimensions as small as 0.0115
   lambda(0) x 0.0115 lambda(0) x 0.0038 lambda(0) (150 mm x 150 mm x 50 mm
   for operation at 22.9 MHz). It is found that the measured gain of such
   architecture can be as high as -18.1 dBi, which is 16.7 dB higher than a
   reference inverted-F antenna realized on a high index material
   (epsilon(R) = 10.2) having exactly the same dimensions. The proposed
   antenna architecture is composed of two in-phase radiating vertical
   elements connected to two inductors between which a capacitive top load
   is connected to achieve the desired resonant condition. The two vertical
   elements act effectively as a monopole having increased height. It is
   also shown that the gain of the antenna can be increased monotonically
   by increasing the quality factor (Q) of the phase shifter. High Q
   air-core inductors that can be accommodated in electrically small
   monopole antenna are designed and incorporated in the phase shifter to
   achieve a gain value of -17.9 dBi. Details about the proposed design
   approach, simulation, and measurement results are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Mass and energy exchange processes near the in-cylinder walls have
   become increasingly important for internal combustion engine research
   and development. Heat-transfer and fuel-deposition processes are not
   well enough understood to fully predict their magnitude and temporal and
   spatial variation. To a large extent, improvements in modeling are
   limited because of a lack of experimental guidance on the dynamics of
   boundary-layer flows in engines. High-speed particle image velocimetry
   and micro particle image velocimetry were used to study the
   boundary-layer flow field at the cylinder head of a motored internal
   combustion engine for three different engine speeds (400, 800 and
   1100r/min). Velocity measurements were taken throughout the compression
   stroke and the beginning of the expansion stroke, and comparisons to the
   frequently used law-of-the-wall were made. The low-resolution particle
   image velocimetry images showed that the average bulk flow maintained a
   tumble flow throughout the compression and expansion strokes and
   velocities scaled with engine speed. Adequate spatial resolution of the
   boundary-layer flow required the use of high-resolution (micro particle
   image velocimetry) measurements which showed that the log-law does not
   accurately describe the experimental boundary-layer structure in the
   outer layer (). Using the log-law, the velocity for earlier crank angles
   (180-260 crank angle degrees) was over predicted while the velocity for
   later crank angles (300-330 crank angle degrees) was under predicted, as
   engine speed increased. However, the experimental velocity profiles near
   the wall () matched the description of the viscous sublayer ().
   Furthermore, it was observed that the thickness of the viscous sublayer
   decreased as the engine speed increased. The viscous sublayer could not
   be adequately resolved at 1100r/min because of the limitations in
   adequate seeding density near the surface and the resulting loss of data
   points closest to the wall. The capability of high-speed particle image
   velocimetry measurements is demonstrated by the ability to identify and
   track vortical structures that move through the outer and buffer layers.
   Future work must address the evolution of such flow structures, along
   with measurements of temperature, to enable development and validation
   of boundary-layer models that are not restricted by the assumptions
   necessary for the law-of-the-wall such as steady bulk flow conditions
   and properties.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in ignition, boosting, and control systems have
   opened up new opportunities for highly dilute, high-pressure combustion
   regimes for gasoline engines. This study analytically explores the
   fundamental thermodynamics of operation in these regimes under realistic
   burn duration, heat loss, boosting, and friction constraints. The intent
   is to identify the benefits of this approach and the path to achieving
   optimum engine and vehicle-level fuel economy. A simple
   engine/turbocharger model in GT-Power is used to perform a parametric
   study exploring the conditions for best engine efficiency. These
   conditions are found in the mid-dilution range, a result of the tradeoff
   between fluid property benefits of lean mixtures and friction benefits
   of higher loads. Dilution with exhaust gas is nearly as effective as air
   dilution when compared using a fuel-to-charge' equivalence ratio defined
   as phi phi (1-RGF) where RGF is the total residual gas fraction. Optimal
   brake efficiencies are obtained over a range 0.45 phi 0.65 for operation
   up to 3 bar manifold pressure, yielding peak temperatures under 2100K
   and peak pressures under 150bar. These conditions are intermediate
   between homogeneous charge compression ignition and spark-ignition
   regimes, and are the subject of much current research on advanced
   combustion modes. An engine-vehicle drive train simulation shows that
   accessing this thermodynamic sweet spot has the potential for vehicle
   fuel economy gains between 23\% and 58\%.}},

Abstract = {{A closed-form solution is obtained for the pull-in instability of curved
   multilayer graphene/substrate microcantilever electrostatic actuators.
   The first-order fringing-field correction and the interlayer shear
   between neighboring graphene layers (GLs) and between the graphene and
   the substrate are incorporated into the analytical model. In the
   solution procedure, the governing fourth-order differential equation of
   variable coefficients is converted into a Fredholm integral equation.
   The resulting equation is solved for the static pull-in voltages by
   adopting the first natural mode of the cantilever beam as a deflection
   shape function. The influence of GLs on the pull-in voltages of the
   electrostatic microactuators is investigated. It is found that laying
   10, 30, and 60 GLs on top of the substrate results in increases of about
   95\%, 190\%, and 295\%, respectively, in the pull-in voltage of the
   straight bilayer graphene/substrate electrostatic microactuators. It is
   also observed that the classical Euler-Bernoulli beam theory fails to
   predict the pull-in voltages of the multilayer graphene/substrate
   electrostatic microactuators, showing that the pull-in voltage is highly
   affected by the graphene interlayer shear.}},

Title = {{Effect of implantation on engineered skeletal muscle constructs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{434-442}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The development of engineered skeletal muscle would provide a viable
   tissue for replacement and repair of muscle damaged by disease or
   injury. Our current tissue-engineering methods result in
   three-dimensional (3D) muscle constructs that generate tension but do
   not advance phenotypically beyond neonatal characteristics. To develop
   to an adult phenotype, innervation and vascularization of the construct
   must occur. In this study, 3D muscle constructs were implanted into the
   hindlimb of a rat, along the sciatic nerve, with the sural nerve
   isolated, transected and sutured to the construct to encourage
   innervation. Aortic ring anchors were sutured to the tendons of the
   biceps femoris muscle so that the construct would move dynamically with
   the endogenous muscle. After 1week in vivo, the constructs were
   explanted, evaluated for force production and stained for muscle, nerve
   and collagen markers. Implanted muscle constructs showed a developing
   capillary system, an epimysium-like outer layer of connective tissue and
   an increase in myofibre content. The beginning of -bungarotoxin
   clustering suggests that neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) could form on
   the implanted muscle, given more time in vivo. Additionally, the
   constructs increased maximum isometric force from 192 +/- 41 N to 549
   +/- 103 N (245\% increase) compared to in vitro controls, which
   increased from 276 +/- 23 N to 329 +/- 27N (25\% increase). These
   findings suggest that engineered muscle tissue survives 1week of
   implantation and begins to develop the necessary interfaces needed to
   advance the phenotype toward adult muscle. However, in terms of force
   production, the muscle constructs need longer implantation times to
   fully develop an adult phenotype. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Particle transport and deposition associated with flow over a wedge is
   investigated as a model for particle transport and flow at the carina of
   an airway bifurcation during inspiration. Using matched asymptotics, a
   uniformly valid solution is obtained to represent the high Reynolds
   number flow over a wedge that considers the viscous boundary layer near
   the wedge and the outer inviscid region and is then used to solve the
   particle transport equations. Sometimes particle impaction on the wedge
   is prevented due to the boundary layer. We call this boundary layer
   shielding (BLS). This effect can be broken down into different types:
   rejection, trapping and deflection that are described by what happens to
   the particle's initial negative velocity normal to the wall either
   changing sign, reaching zero, or remaining negative in the boundary
   layer region. The deposition efficiency depends on the critical Stokes
   number but exhibits a weak dependence on Reynolds number. Deposition
   efficiency for S-c in the range 0 < S-c < 0.4 yields the following
   relationship <inline-graphic xlink:href={''}DQS002IM1{''}
   xmlns:xlink={''}http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink{''}/> at large Reynolds
   numbers, where beta pi is the wedge angle. For a specific deposition
   efficiency, S-c decreases as beta pi increases. The distribution of
   impacted particles was also computed and revealed that particles
   primarily impact within one airway diameter of the carina, consistent
   with computational fluid dynamics approaches. This work provides a new
   insight that the BLS inherent to the wedge component of the structure is
   the dominant reason for the particle distribution. This finding is
   important in linking aerosol deposition to the location of airway
   disease as well as target sites for therapeutic deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Optogenetics, the use of light to stimulate or inhibit neural circuits
   via viral transduction of protein channels, has emerged as a possible
   method of treating epilepsy. By introducing viral vectors carrying
   algal-derived cation or anion channels, known as opsins, neurons that
   initiate or propagate seizures may be silenced. To date, studies using
   this technique have been performed in animal models, and current efforts
   are moving toward more sophisticated nonhuman primate models. In this
   paper, the authors present a brief overview of the development of
   optogenetics and review recent studies investigating optogenetic
   modification of circuits involved in seizures. Further developments in
   the field are explored, with an emphasis on how optogenetics may
   influence future neurosurgical interventions.

Abstract = {{Background: Thoracic artificial lungs have been proposed as a bridge to
   transplant in patients with end-stage lung disease. Systemic embolic
   complications can occur after thoracic artificial lung attachment in the
   pulmonary artery to left atrium configuration. Therefore, we evaluated
   the function of a compliant thoracic artificial lung attached via the
   proximal pulmonary artery to distal main pulmonary artery configuration.
   Methods: The compliant thoracic artificial lung was attached to 5 sheep
   (63 +/- 0.9 kg) in the proximal pulmonary artery to distal main
   pulmonary artery configuration. Device function and animal hemodynamics
   were assessed at baseline and with approximately 60\%, 75\%, and 90\% of
   cardiac output diverted to the compliant thoracic artificial lung. At
   each condition, dobutamine (0 and 5 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1)) was used to
   simulate rest and exercise conditions.
   Results: At rest, cardiac output decreased from 6.20 +/- 0.53 L/min at
   baseline to 5.40 +/- 0.43, 4.66 +/- 0.31, and 4.05 +/- 0.27 L/min with
   60\%, 75\%, and 90\% of cardiac output to the compliant thoracic
   artificial lung, respectively (P<.01 for each flow diversion vs
   baseline). During exercise, cardiac output decreased from 7.85 +/- 0.70
   L/min at baseline to 7.46 +/- 0.55, 6.93 +/- 0.51, and 5.96 +/- 0.44
   L/min (P=.82, P=.19, and P<.01 with respect to baseline) with 60\%,
   75\%, and 90\% of cardiac output to the compliant thoracic artificial
   lung, respectively. The artificial lung resistance averaged 0.46 +/-
   0.02 and did not vary significantly with blood flow rate.
   Conclusions: Use of a compliant thoracic artificial lung may be feasible
   in the proximal pulmonary artery to distal main pulmonary artery setting
   if its blood flow is held at less than 75\% of cardiac output. To ensure
   a decrease in cardiac output of less than 10\%, a blood flow rate less
   than 60\% of cardiac output is advised.}},

Abstract = {{Progress in nanocrystal synthesis and self-assembly enables the
   formation of highly ordered superlattices. Recent studies focused on
   spherical particles with tunable attraction and polyhedral particles
   with anisotropic shape, and excluded volume repulsion, but the effects
   of shape on particle interaction are only starting to be exploited. Here
   we present a joint experimental-computational multiscale investigation
   of a class of highly faceted planar lanthanide fluoride nanocrystals
   (nanoplates, nanoplatelets). The nanoplates self-assemble into
   long-range ordered tilings at the liquid-air interface formed by a
   hexane wetting layer. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that
   their assembly can be understood from maximization of packing density
   only in a first approximation. Explaining the full phase behaviour
   requires an understanding of nanoplate-edge interactions, which
   originate from the atomic structure, as confirmed by density functional
   theory calculations. Despite the apparent simplicity in particle
   geometry, the combination of shape-induced entropic and edge-specific
   energetic effects directs the formation and stabilization of
   unconventional long-range ordered assemblies not attainable otherwise.}},

Abstract = {{This study utilized transplanted bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) as a
   cellular replacement therapy to remedy radiation-induced injury and
   restore impaired new bone formation during distraction osteogenesis
   (DO). BMSC therapy brought about the successful generation of new bone
   and significantly improved both the rate and quality of a bony union of
   irradiated, distracted {[}X-ray radiation therapy (XRT)/DO] murine
   mandibles to the level of nonirradiated DO animals. The bone mineral
   density and bone volume fraction were also significantly improved by the
   BMSC replacement therapy showing no difference when compared to
   nonirradiated animals. Finally, a biomechanical analysis examining the
   yield, failure load, and ultimate load also demonstrated a significantly
   improved structural integrity in BMSC-treated XRT/DO mandibles over
   XRT/DO alone. These results indicate that administration of BMSCs
   intraoperatively to a radiated distraction gap can function as an
   adequate stimulant to rescue the ability for irradiated bone to undergo
   DO and produce a healed regenerate of a vastly superior quality and
   strength. We believe that the fundamental information on the
   optimization of bone regeneration in the irradiated mandible provided by
   this work has immense potential to be translated from the bench to the
   bedside to lead to improved therapeutic options for patients suffering
   from the disastrous sequelae of radiation therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Non-invasive histotripsy therapy has previously been used to achieve
   precise fetal tissue ablation in a sheep model. To further assess the
   clinical viability of the technique, this study investigated potential
   effects of histotripsy therapy during the remaining gestation and its
   local impact on fetal development. Five ewes (six lambs) at 95-107 d of
   gestation were treated and allowed to complete the full gestation period
   of 150 d. A 1-MHz focused transducer was used to treat the fetal kidney
   and liver with 5-ms pulses at 500-Hz repetition rates and 10- to 16-MPa
   peak negative pressures; ultrasound imaging provided real-time treatment
   guidance. The lambs were euthanized after delivery and treated organs
   were harvested. Samples were examined by magnetic resonance imaging and
   histopathologic analysis. These data were compared with results from
   four other ewes (four lambs) that underwent similar treatments but were
   sacrificed immediately after the procedure. The sheep tolerated the
   treatment well, and acute lesion samples displayed well-defined ablated
   regions characterized by the presence of fractionated tissue and
   hemorrhage. All fetuses that were allowed to continue gestation survived
   and were delivered at full term. The lambs were healthy on delivery,
   with no signs of external injury. A minor indentation was observed in
   each of the treated kidneys with minimal presence of fibrous tissue,
   while no discernible signs of lesions were detected in treated livers.
   In a sheep model, histotripsy-mediated fetal tissue ablation caused no
   acute or pregnancy-related complications, supporting the potential
   safety and effectiveness of histotripsy therapy as a tool in fetal
   intervention procedures. (E-mail: yohankim@umich.edu) (C) 2013 World

Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{Methylocystis strain SB2, a facultative methanotroph capable of growth
   on multi-carbon compounds, was screened for its ability to degrade the
   priority pollutants 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), 1,1,2-trichloroethane
   (1,1,2-TCA), and 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1-DCE), as well as
   cis-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE) when grown on methane or ethanol.
   Methylocystis strain SB2 degraded 1,2-DCA and 1,1,2-TCA when grown on
   either substrate and cis-DCE when grown on methane. Growth of
   Methylocystis strain SB2 on methane was inhibited in the presence of all
   compounds, while only 1,1-DCE and cis-DCE inhibited growth on ethanol.
   No degradation of any chlorinated hydrocarbon was observed in
   ethanol-grown cultures when particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO)
   activity was inhibited with the addition of acetylene, indicating that
   competition for binding to the pMMO between the chlorinated hydrocarbons
   and methane limited both methanotrophic growth and pollutant degradation
   when this strain was grown on methane. Characterization of Methylocystis
   strain SB2 found no evidence of a high-affinity form of pMMO for
   methane, nor could this strain utilize 1,2-DCA or its putative oxidative
   products 2-chloroethanol or chloroactetic acid as sole growth
   substrates, suggesting that this strain lacks appropriate dehydrogenases
   for the conversion of 1,2-DCA to glyoxylate. As ethanol: (1) can be used
   as an alternative growth substrate for promoting pollutant degradation
   by Methylocystis strain SB2 as the pMMO is not required for its growth
   on ethanol and (2) has been used to enhance the mobility of chlorinated
   hydrocarbons in situ, it is proposed that ethanol can be used to enhance
   both pollutant transport and biodegradation by Methylocystis strain SB2.}},

Abstract = {{We present a growth process mediated by nanoimprinted nanostructures
   specifically for producing bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) topological
   insulator nanoribbons with a high yield. In this process, topological
   insulator nanostructures are grown on nanoimprinted gratings by using a
   nanoparticle-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. In comparison with
   the growth processes performed on flat and randomly rough substrates,
   such a nanograting-mediated growth method produces topological insulator
   nanoribbons with a higher yield (similar to 15 000 nanoribbons/mm(2)), a
   narrower average ribbon width (w (avg)< 60 nm), and a higher uniformity
   in ribbon width (sigma < 30 nm); effectively suppresses the formation of
   other unwanted morphologies; and also results in the axial growth of
   nanoribbons along specific in-plane directions relative to
   pre-structured gratings. Such technical merits of nanograting-mediated
   growth are attributed to the preferential nucleation of Bi2Se3 crystal
   seeds and the concomitant pinning of catalytic nanoparticles at ordered
   grating edges. Finally, Aharonov-Bohm interference oscillations in the
   magnetoresistance were observed and demonstrated the coherent transport
   of electrons through topological surface states of Bi2Se3 nanoribbons.
   This growth process in combination with large-area nanoimprint
   lithography could serve as an important foundation for nanomanufacturing
   topological insulator nanoribbons with controllable feature size,
   large-area uniformity, and ordering, suitable for applications in future
   low-dissipation nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient parallel approximation scheme for a new
   class of min-max problems. The algorithm is derived from the matrix
   multiplicative weights update method and can be used to find
   near-optimal strategies for competitive two-party classical or quantum
   interactions in which a referee exchanges any number of messages with
   one party followed by any number of additional messages with the other.
   It considerably extends the class of interactions which admit parallel
   solutions, demonstrating for the first time the existence of a parallel
   algorithm for an interaction in which one party reacts adaptively to the
   other.
   As a consequence, we prove that several competing-provers complexity
   classes collapse to PSPACE, such as QRG(2), SQG and two new classes
   called DIP and DQIP. A special case of our result is a parallel
   approximation scheme for a specific class of semidefinite programs whose
   feasible region consists of lists of semidefinite matrices that satisfy
   a transcript-like consistency condition. Applied to this special case,
   our algorithm yields a direct polynomial-space simulation of
   multi-message quantum interactive proofs resulting in a first-principles
   proof of QIP =PSPACE.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new post-CMOS-compatible piezoelectric
   thin/thick film technology that allows wafer-level integration of bulk
   piezoelectric ceramics such as lead zirconium titanate (PZT) and lead
   magnesium niobatelead titanate (PMN-PT) on silicon substrates with
   precisely determined final film thickness of 5-100 mu m while preserving
   the original material quality. We bond commercially available bulk
   piezoelectric substrates to silicon using reliable and low-temperature
   (200 degrees C) gold-indium (Au-In) diffusion bonding or parylene
   bonding. An enhanced fixed-abrasive lapping/polishing process thins the
   piezoelectric layer to the desired thickness with high precision and
   wafer-level uniformity (+/- 0.5 mu m). The fabricated films have bond
   interface shear strength of 1.5-4.5 MPa and average surface roughness of
   43 nm, with bulk ferroelectric/piezoelectric properties preserved, such
   as remnant polarization (37.7 mu C/cm(2)), coercive field (1.95 kV/mm),
   and effective longitudinal piezoelectric strain coefficients (140-840
   pm/V). In addition, extensions of this process show the feasibility of
   fabricating bimorph layers via successive bonding/thinning, and of
   forming suspended structures on silicon via surface micromachining. The
   flexible process can easily be adapted for batch-mode silicon
   integration of a variety of other electroceramics.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To quantify the effect of handhold size (diameter) on the
   maximum breakaway strength between a hand and handhold for children.
   Background: Falls from playground equipment are a major cause of
   childhood injury and death. It is unclear if recommendations for
   handholds on playground equipment are too broad.
   Methods: Breakaway strength was defined as the maximum quasistatic force
   that can be exerted on a grasped object before the object is forcibly
   pulled from the grasp. Hand anthropometry, grip, and breakaway strengths
   were measured for 397 children between the ages of 6 and 11 years. Three
   cylindrical handhold diameters were tested.
   Results: Breakaway strength was significantly affected by handhold size,
   gender, and hand dominance. Significant covariate predictors for
   breakaway strength included grip strength, age, and hand breadth.
   Breakaway strength was reduced for the largest diameter (3.81 cm) for
   children of all ages.
   Conclusion: Handhold design factors significantly affect the breakaway
   strength of children.
   Application: The results can be used as a basis for design
   recommendations for hand rungs used by children to reliably support
   their bodyweight.}},

Abstract = {{Intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) administration increases systemic
   and craniofacial bone mass. However, the effect of PTH therapy on
   healing of tooth extraction sites is unknown. The aims of this study
   were to determine the effect of PTH therapy on tooth extraction socket
   healing and to examine whether PTH intra-oral injection promotes
   healing. The mandibular first molars were extracted in rats, and
   subcutaneous PTH was administered intermittently for 7, 14, and 28 days.
   In a second study, maxillary second molars were extracted, and PTH was
   administered by either subcutaneous or intra-oral injection to determine
   the efficacy of intra-oral PTH administration. Healing was assessed by
   micro-computed tomography and histomorphometric analyses. PTH therapy
   accelerated the entire healing process and promoted both hard-and
   soft-tissue healing by increasing bone fill and connective tissue
   maturation. PTH therapy by intra-oral injection was as effective as
   subcutaneous injection in promoting tooth extraction socket healing. The
   findings suggest that PTH therapy promotes tooth extraction socket
   healing and that intra-oral injections can be used to administer PTH.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative sensory testing (QST) can provide useful information about
   the underlying mechanisms involved in chronic pain. However, currently
   available devices typically employed suffer from operator-dependent
   effects, or are too cumbersome for routine clinical care. This paper
   presents the design and initial validation of a novel automated
   pressure-pain type QST platform, termed the multi-modal automated
   sensory testing (MAST) system. The MAST configuration presented consists
   of wireless, hand-held thumbnail pressure stimulators (with circular 10
   mm(2) rubber tips) and graphical touch screen interface devices to
   manage the QST process and obtain patient feedback. Validation testing
   of the custom-designed force sensor showed a 1 \% error for low forces
   increasing to 2 \% error for larger loads up to 100 N (full-scale).
   Validation of the controller using three ramp rates (64, 248, and 496
   kPa/s) and six pressures (32, 62, 124, 273, 620, and 1116 kPa) showed an
   overall mean error of 1.7 \% for applied stimuli. Clinical evaluation
   revealed decreased pressure pain thresholds in chronic pain patients
   (98.07 +/- A SE 16.34 kPa) compared to pain free, healthy control
   subjects (259.88 +/- A SE 33.54 kPa, p = 0.001). The MAST system is
   portable and produces accurate, repeatable stimulation profiles
   indicating potential for point-of-care applications.}},

Abstract = {{Direct observation and simulation of keyhole dynamics is the key to the
   study of laser drilling. In this study, the author used a piece of
   transparent material GG17 glass to perform a direct observation of the
   dynamics in laser drilling. This technique enabled us to analyze the
   developmental process of elongated keyhole formation and the flow
   characteristics of the vapor and molten materials in the keyhole.
   Subsequently, the various features associated with laser drilling
   velocity and depth and the influence of laser power and defocus distance
   on the drilling velocity were investigated in experiments. In addition,
   to simulate the process of material vaporization removal during laser
   drilling process, a finite element model was established for laser
   drilling with Gaussian heating. To compensate for the multiple
   reflection of the laser on the keyhole wall and the energy loss during
   the drilling process, a convergence function, a coordination function
   and a factor function were introduced at the same time to model the
   changes of the laser energy and its intensity distribution as it reached
   the keyhole bottom. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The autofocus problem in synthetic aperture radar imaging amounts to
   estimating unknown phase errors caused by unknown platform or target

   namely, phase gradient autofocus, multichannel autofocus (MCA), and
   Fourier-domain multichannel autofocus (FMCA), is the solution of a
   constant modulus quadratic program (CMQP). Currently, these algorithms
   solve a CMQP by using an eigenvalue relaxation approach. We propose an
   alternative relaxation approach based on semidefinite programming, which
   has recently attracted considerable attention in other signal processing
   problems. Experimental results show that our proposed methods provide
   promising performance improvements for MCA and FMCA through an increase
   in computational complexity.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Multi-dimensional and transient flows play a key role in many areas of
   science, engineering, and health sciences but are often not well
   understood. The complex nature of these flows may be studied using
   particle image velocimetry (PIV), a laser-based imaging technique for
   optically accessible flows. Though many forms of PIV exist that extend
   the technique beyond the original planar two-component velocity
   measurement capabilities, the basic PIV system consists of a light
   source (laser), a camera, tracer particles, and analysis algorithms. The
   imaging and recording parameters, the light source, and the algorithms
   are adjusted to optimize the recording for the flow of interest and
   obtain valid velocity data.
   Common PIV investigations measure two-component velocities in a plane at
   a few frames per second. However, recent developments in instrumentation
   have facilitated high-frame rate (> 1 kHz) measurements capable of
   resolving transient flows with high temporal resolution. Therefore,
   high-frame rate measurements have enabled investigations on the
   evolution of the structure and dynamics of highly transient flows. These
   investigations play a critical role in understanding the fundamental
   physics of complex flows.
   A detailed description for performing high-resolution, high-speed planar
   PIV to study a transient flow near the surface of a flat plate is
   presented here. Details for adjusting the parameter constraints such as
   image and recording properties, the laser sheet properties, and
   processing algorithms to adapt PIV for any flow of interest are
   included.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Surfaces that display contact angles greater than 150 degrees along with
   a low contact angle hysteresis for low surface tension liquids such as
   oils and alcohols are known as superoleophobic surfaces. Such surfaces
   are of interest for a diverse array of applications including
   self-cleaning, nonfouling, stain-free clothing and spill-resistant
   protective wear, drag reduction, microrobots for aqueous and chemical
   environments and icephobicity. Recently, significant advances have been
   made in understanding the criteria required to design superoleophobic
   surfaces. In this article, the authors discuss the roles of surface
   energy and roughness, the critical role of re-entrant texture and the
   role of hierarchical structure in fabricating superoleophobic surfaces.
   On the basis of this understanding, the authors also discuss two design
   parameters that allow for the systematic design of superoleophobic
   surfaces. The authors also summarize the recent studies on
   superoleophobic surfaces and emphasize the need for careful and diligent
   characterization. Finally, the authors conclude with the major
   challenges and opportunities for research on superoleophobic surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis of a series of aromatic azo-linkers (L1-L4),
   which are selectively recognized and cleaved by azoreductase enzymes
   present in the cytoplasm of hepatic cancer cells via a NADPH-dependent
   mechanism. We utilized L1-L4 azo-linkers to conjugate doxorubicin to
   generation 5 (G5) of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers to prepare G5-L(x)-DOX
   nanoconjugates. We incorporated electron-donating oxygen (O) or nitrogen
   (N) groups in the para and ortho positions of L1-L4 azo-linkers to
   control the electronegativity of G5-L(x)-DOX conjugates and investigated
   their cleavage by azoreductase enzymes and the associated release of
   loaded DOX molecules. Hammett sigma values of G5-L(x)-DOX conjugates
   ranged from -0.44 to -1.27, which is below the reported er threshold
   (-0.37) required for binding to azoreductase enzymes. Results show that
   incubation of G5-L1-DOX (sigma = -0.44), G5-L2-DOX (sigma = -0.71),
   G5-L3-DOX (sigma = -1.00), and G5-L4-DOX (sigma = -1.27) conjugates with
   human liver microsomal (HLM) enzymes and the S9 fraction isolated from
   HepG2 hepatic cancer cells results in release of 4\%-8\%, 17\%, 60\%,
   and 100\% of the conjugated DOX molecules, respectively. These results
   show that increasing the electronegativity (i.e. lower sigma value) of
   L1-L4 azo-linkers increases their susceptibility to cleavage by
   azoreductase enzymes. Intracellular cleavage of G5-L(x)-DOX
   nanoconjugates, release of conjugated DOX molecules, and cytotoxicity
   correlated with conjugate's electronegativity (a value) was
   investigated, with G5-L4-DOX conjugate exhibiting the highest toxicity
   towards hepatic cancer cells with an IC50 of 13 nM +/- 5 nM in HepG2
   cells. Cleavage of G5-L(x)-DOX conjugates was specific to hepatic cancer
   cells as shown by low non-specific DOX release upon incubation with
   non-enzymatic insect proteins and the S9 fraction isolated from rat
   cardiomyocytes. These enzyme-activated G5-L(x)-DOX conjugates represent
   a drug delivery platform that can achieve tunable and cell-specific
   release of the loaded cargo in hepatic cancer cells. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{94-105}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we developed two frameworks to investigate the
   thermophoretic particulate deposition in non-isothermal tube flows
   conveying particles ranging from 10 to 300 nm; a one dimensional model
   where the variables are assumed to be uniform in each cross section
   perpendicular to the tube axis and an axi-symmetric model where the
   aforementioned assumption is relaxed. In the one dimensional model, the
   rate of mass deposition along the inner surface of the tube is computed
   based on the local thermophoretic velocity of the particulate phase at
   the wall. This velocity is proportional to the radial gradient of the
   temperature at the wall and is calculated via some empirical
   correlations for heat transfer in tube flows. In the axi-symmetric
   model, the rate of deposition is computed through the Fick's law after
   solving the species transport equation for the solid phase. We included
   the formation of the soot layer through moving the gas-solid interface
   in both models. The tube effectiveness (the ratio of actual heat
   transfer to the maximum possible heat transfer) decreases due to the
   formation of the layer. Model outputs including deposited mass along the
   tube wall and the tube effectiveness drop have been compared against
   experiments. While the computed results through both models agree with
   the trend of experimental data, the axi-symmetric results are closer to
   the experiments in most cases. The calculated deposited mass is smaller
   (and closer to experiments) for the axi-symmetric model compared to the
   one dimensional model in all cases. This indicates that the
   axi-symmetric model estimates the deposited mass more accurately. (C)

Abstract = {{Ag/mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 catalysts with different loaded second
   metals (Au, Ba, Pd, Sn, and Cu) were tested for catalytic activity
   toward ethylene oxide formation from the epoxidation reaction of
   ethylene, in comparison to Ag- and Au-loaded on the SrTiO3 supports. To
   promote long-term stability, Sn was added to the optimum bimetallic
   catalyst. The catalysts were analytically characterized by
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS),
   temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The addition of a second metal of Au, Ba,
   or Cu significantly improved the catalytic performance for ethylene
   epoxidation, whereas the Pd and Sn did not. The Cu-Ag bimetallic
   catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic ethylene oxide production
   activity. An addition of Sn to this catalyst greatly promoted the
   long-term stability toward the ethylene epoxidation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Modular tissue engineering applies biomaterials-based approaches to
   create discrete cell-seeded microenvironments, which can be further
   assembled into larger constructs for the repair of injured tissues. In
   the current study, we embedded human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
   stem cells (MSC) and human adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) in
   collagen/fibrin (COL/FIB) and collagen/fibrin/hydroxyapatite
   (COL/FIB/HA) microbeads, and evaluated their suitability for bone tissue
   engineering applications. Microbeads were fabricated using a
   water-in-oil emulsification process, resulting in an average microbead
   diameter of approximately 130 +/- 25 m. Microbeads supported both cell
   viability and cell spreading of MSC and ASC over 7 days in culture. The
   embedded cells also began to remodel and compact the microbead matrix as
   demonstrated by confocal reflectance microscopy imaging. After two weeks
   of culture in media containing osteogenic supplements, both MSC and ASC
   deposited calcium mineral in COL/FIB microbeads, but not in COL/FIB/HA
   microbeads. There were no significant differences between MSC and ASC in
   any of the assays examined, suggesting that either cell type may be an
   appropriate cell source for orthopedic applications. This study has
   implications in the creation of defined microenvironments for bone
   repair, and in developing a modular approach for delivery of
   pre-differentiated cells. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Abstract = {{Stress-based forming limit diagrams for a two-stage forming technique
   with an intermediate annealing step were generated for aluminum alloy
   5182-O with a new experimental/theoretical methodology. It was
   demonstrated that unlike strain-based forming limits, stress-based
   forming limits are independent of pre-strain levels, pre-strain paths
   and annealing conditions, and converge to a single forming limit curve
   that is close to the stress forming limit of the as-received material.
   For this purpose, AA5182-O specimens were pre-strained to various levels
   in uniaxial, plane strain, and equibiaxial tension; smaller shapes were
   extracted, annealed, and tested in limiting dome height (LDH) tests.
   Strain fields for the forming limit diagrams were measured with stereo
   digital image correlation during each LDH test, where the onset of
   localized necking was identified to construct the forming limits. In the
   calculation of stress-based forming limit curves, only the as-received
   material properties were required, while the effects of pre-strain and
   annealing were accounted for with a calculated constant ``effective
   plastic strain.{''} An analytical method is described to develop a new
   experimental/theoretical methodology effectively predicting the
   pre-strain and annealing effects. This enables reliable prediction of
   formability in multi-stage forming processes interrupted by annealing
   treatment employed to recover additional stretchability in critical
   areas of a formed part. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   algorithms for the verification of liveness of Gadara nets, and report

   examples of real-world programs. The results in this paper lay the

Abstract = {{The tetra(ethylene glycol) derivative of benzothiazole aniline,
   BTA-EG(4), is a novel amyloid-binding small molecule that can penetrate
   the blood-brain barrier and protect cells from A beta-induced toxicity.
   However, the effects of A beta-targeting molecules on other cellular
   processes, including those that modulate synaptic plasticity, remain
   unknown. We report here that BTA-EG(4) decreases A beta levels, alters
   cell surface expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and improves
   memory in wild-type mice. Interestingly, the BTA-EG(4)-mediated
   behavioral improvement is not correlated with LTP, but with increased
   spinogenesis. The higher dendritic spine density reflects an increase in
   the number of functional synapses as determined by increased miniature
   EPSC (mEPSC) frequency without changes in presynaptic parameters or
   postsynaptic mEPSC amplitude. Additionally, BTA-EG(4) requires APP to
   regulate dendritic spine density through a Ras signaling-dependent
   mechanism. Thus, BTA-EG(4) may provide broad therapeutic benefits for
   improving neuronal and cognitive function, and may have implications in
   neurodegenerative disease therapy.}},

Title = {{Ab initio and classical molecular dynamics studies of the structural and
   dynamical behavior of water near a hydrophobic graphene sheet}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of water near a graphene sheet is investigated by means of
   ab initio and classical molecular dynamics simulations. The wetting of
   the graphene sheet by ab initio water and the relation of such behavior
   to the strength of classical dispersion interaction between surface
   atoms and water are explored. The first principles simulations reveal a
   layered solvation structure around the graphene sheet with a significant
   water density in the interfacial region implying no drying or cavitation
   effect. It is found that the ab initio results of water density at
   interfaces can be reproduced reasonably well by classical simulations
   with a tuned dispersion potential between the surface and water
   molecules. Calculations of vibrational power spectrum from ab initio
   simulations reveal a shift of the intramolecular stretch modes to higher
   frequencies for interfacial water molecules when compared with those of
   the second solvation later or bulk-like water due to the presence of
   free OH modes near the graphene sheet. Also, a weakening of the
   water-water hydrogen bonds in the vicinity of the graphene surface is
   found in our ab initio simulations as reflected in the shift of
   intermolecular vibrational modes to lower frequencies for interfacial
   water molecules. The first principles calculations also reveal that the
   residence and orientational dynamics of interfacial water are somewhat
   slower than those of the second layer or bulk-like molecules. However,
   the lateral diffusion and hydrogen bond relaxation of interfacial water
   molecules are found to occur at a somewhat faster rate than that of the
   bulk-like water molecules. The classical molecular dynamics simulations
   with tuned Lennard-Jones surface-water interaction are found to produce
   dynamical results that are qualitatively similar to those of ab initio
   molecular dynamics simulations. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL CELL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In vitro, topographical and biophysical cues arising from the
   extracellular matrix (ECM) direct skeletal stem cell (SSC) commitment
   and differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which the SSC-ECM
   interface is regulated and the outcome of such interactions on stem cell
   fate in vivo remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that conditional
   deletion of the membrane-anchored metalloproteinase MT1-MMP (Mmp14) in
   mesenchymal progenitors, but not in committed osteoblasts, redirects SSC
   fate decisions from osteogenesis to adipo- and chondrogenesis. By
   effecting ECM remodeling, MT1-MMP regulates stem cell shape, thereby
   activating a beta 1-integrin/RhoGTPase signaling cascade and triggering
   the nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivators YAP and
   TAZ, which serve to control SSC line-age commitment. These data identify
   a critical MT1-MMP/integrin/YAP/TAZ axis operative in the stem cell
   niche that oversees SSC fate determination.}},

Abstract = {{The thermopower (S) and electrical conductivity (sigma) in conventional
   semiconductors are coupled adversely through the carriers' density (n)
   making it difficult to achieve meaningful simultaneous improvements in
   both electronic properties through doping and/or substitutional
   chemistry. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of coherently embedded
   full-Heusler (FH) quantum dots (QDs) in tailoring the density, mobility,
   and effective mass of charge carriers in the n-type Ti0.1Zr0.9NiSn
   half-Heusler matrix. We propose that the embedded FH QD forms a
   potential barrier at the interface with the matrix due to the offset of
   their conduction band minima. This potential barrier discriminates
   existing charge carriers from the conduction band of the matrix with
   respect to their relative energy leading to simultaneous large
   enhancements of the thermopower (up to 200\%) and carrier mobility (up
   to 43\%) of the resulting Ti0.1Zr0.9Ni1+xSn nanocomposites. The
   improvement in S with increasing mole fraction of the FH-QDs arises from
   a drastic reduction (up to 250\%) in the effective carrier density
   coupled with an increase in the carrier's effective mass (m{*}), whereas
   the surprising enhancement in the mobility (mu) is attributed to an
   increase in the carrier's relaxation time (tau). This strategy to
   manipulate the transport behavior of existing ensembles of charge
   carriers within a bulk semiconductor using QDs is very promising and
   could pave the way to a new generation of high figure of merit
   thermoelectric materials.}},

Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{The effect of gravity on the onset and growth rate of capillary
   instabilities in viscous liquid jets is studied. To this end, a spatial
   linear stability analysis of Cosserat's equations is performed using a
   multiscale expansion technique. A dispersion relation and expressions
   for the perturbation amplitude are derived to evaluate the growth rate
   of the most unstable axisymmetric disturbance mode. Modeling results are
   compared with classical results in the limit of zero Bond number,
   confirming the validity of this approach. Expressions for the critical
   Weber number, demarcating the transition between convective and absolute
   instability are derived as functions of capillary and Bond numbers.
   Parametric investigations for a range of relevant operating conditions
   (characterized by capillary, Weber, and Bond numbers) are performed to
   examine the jet breakup and the perturbation growth rate. In addition to
   the physical insight that is obtained from this investigation, the
   results that are presented in this work could also be of relevance as
   test cases for the algorithmic development and the verification of
   high-fidelity multiphase simulation codes.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of two, scattering gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to
   plasmonically couple in a manner that is dependent on the interparticle
   separation has been exploited to measure nanometer-level displacements.
   However, despite broad applicability to monitoring biophysical dynamics,
   the long time scales (<5 Hz) with which plasmonic coupling are typically
   measured are not suitable for many dynamic molecular processes,
   generally occurring over several milliseconds. Here, we introduce a new
   technique intended to overcome this technical limitation: ratiometric
   analysis using monochromatic, evanescent darkfield illumination
   (RAMEDI). As a proof-of-principle, we monitored dynamic, plasmonic
   coupling arising from the binding of single biotin- and neutravidin-GNPs
   with a temporal resolution of 38 ms. We also show that the observable
   bandwidth is extendable to faster time scales by demonstrating that
   RAMEDI is capable of achieving a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20
   from individual GNPs observed with 200 Hz bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the use of a dehydrating oil system to determine
   binodal curves of an aqueous two phase system (ATPS). Aqueous droplets
   containing phase-forming polymers are dehydrated at the interface
   between two immiscible oils. The droplets shrink due to diffusion of
   water into the oil phase while constantly maintaining a spherical shape.
   Upon sufficient dehydration, dilute one-phase solutions of phase-forming
   polymers separate into two phases. Comparison of the droplet diameter at
   this phase separation point and at the beginning allows facile
   calculation of the concentration of polymers that determine the binodal
   curve. The miniaturized droplet dehydration-based binodals obtained in
   this manner matched the binodals determined by the conventional diluting
   method but using several orders of magnitude less sample volume (150 nL
   droplets versus 10 mL vials).}},

Abstract = {{The performances of fresh and sulfated MnOx-CeO2 catalysts for selective
   catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 (NH3-SCR) in a low-temperature range
   (T < 300 degrees C) Were investigated. Characterization of these
   catalysts aimed at elucidating the role of additive and the effect of
   sulfation. The catalyst having a Sn:Mn:Ce = 1:4:5 molar ratio showed the
   widest SCR activity improvement with near 100\% NOx conversion at
   110-230 degrees C. Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   indicated that Sn modification significantly increases the concentration
   of oxygen vacancies that may facilitate NO oxidation to NO2. NH3-TPD
   characterization showed that the low-temperature NH3-SCR activity is
   well correlated with surface acidity for NH3 adsorption, which is also
   enhanced by Sn modification. Furthermore, as compared to MnOx-CeO2,
   Sn-modified MnOx-CeO2 showed remarkably improved tolerance to SO2
   sulfation and to the :combined effect of SO2 and H2O. In the presence of
   SO2 and H2O, the Sn-modified MnOx-CeO2.catalyst gave 62\% and 94\% NOx
   conversions as compared to 18\% and 56\% over MnOx-CeO2 at temperatures
   of 110 and 220 degrees C respectively. Sulfation of SnO2-modified
   MnOx-CeO2 may form Ce(III) sulfate that could enhance the Lewis acidity
   and improve NO oxidation to NO2 during NH3-SCR at T > 200 degrees C.}},

Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1216-1225}},

Abstract = {{Intercalation compounds, used as electrodes in Li-ion batteries, are a
   fascinating class of materials that exhibit a wide variety of
   electronic, crystallographic, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties.
   With open structures that allow for the easy insertion and removal of Li
   ions, the properties of these materials strongly depend on the interplay
   of the host chemistry and crystal structure, the Li concentration, and
   electrode particle morphology. The large variations in Li concentration
   within electrodes during each charge and discharge cycle of a Li battery
   are often accompanied by phase transformations. These transformations
   include order disorder transitions, two-phase reactions that require the
   passage of an interface through the electrode particles, and structural
   phase transitions, in which the host undergoes a crystallographic
   change. Although the chemistry of an electrode material determines the
   voltage range in which it is electrochemically active, the crystal
   structure of the compound often plays a crucial role in determining the
   shape of the voltage profile as a function of Li concentration.
   While the relationship between the voltage profile and crystal structure
   of transition metal oxide and sulfide intercalation compounds is well
   characterized, far less is known about the kinetic behavior of these
   materials. For example, because these processes are especially difficult
   to isolate experimentally, solid-state Li diffusion, phase
   transformation mechanisms, and interface reactions remain poorly
   understood. In this respect, first-principles statistical mechanical
   approaches can elucidate the effect of chemistry and crystal structure
   on kinetic properties.
   In this Account, we review the key factors that govern Li diffusion in
   intercalation compounds and illustrate how the complexity of Li
   diffusion mechanisms correlates with the crystal structure of the
   compound. A variety of important diffusion mechanisms and associated
   migration barriers are sensitive to the overall Li concentration,
   resulting in diffusion coefficients that can vary by several orders of
   magnitude with changes in the lithium content Vacancy dusters, groupings
   of vacancies within the crystal lattice, provide a common mechanism that
   mediates Li diffusion in important intercalation compounds. This
   mechanism emerges from specific crystallographic features of the host
   and results in a strong decrease of the Li diffusion coefficient as Li
   is added to an already Li rich host Other crystallographic and
   electronic factors, such as the proximity of transition metal ions to
   activated states of hops and the occurrence of electronically induced
   distortions, can result in a strong dependence of the Li mobility on the
   overall Li concentration. The insights obtained from fundamental studies
   of ionic diffusion in electrode materials will be instrumental for
   physical chemists, chemical engineers, synthetic chemists, and materials
   and device designers who are developing these technologies.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to monitoring natural frequency shift, bifurcation-based
   sensing techniques utilize dramatic switches in response amplitude to

   configuration is broadly applicable from, e.g., microscale mass sensing

Abstract = {{The authors demonstrate a bio-inspired optofluidic laser with luciferin,
   a class of light-emitting compounds synthesized by many different
   organisms, as the gain medium. The laser characteristics under various
   conditions such as solution pH value and luciferin concentration are
   investigated. The authors demonstrate an optofluidic fluorescence
   resonance energy transfer laser by using luciferin and Rhodamine 6G as
   the donor and the acceptor, respectively, which takes advantage of the
   large Stokes shift of luciferin to avoid potential cross excitation of
   the acceptor. Their work leads to the photonic devices using
   biosynthesized materials as the gain medium and optofluidic intra-cavity
   bio/chemical sensing. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Month = {{MAY 17}},
Abstract = {{Tail-biting trellises are defined on a circular time axis and can have a
   smaller number of states than equivalent conventional trellises.
   Existing circular Viterbi algorithms (CVAs) on the tail-biting trellis
   are non-convergent and sub-optimal. In this study, we show that the net
   path metric of each tail-biting path is lower-bounded during the
   decoding process of the CVA. This property can be applied to remove
   unnecessary iterations of the CVA and results in a convergent maximum
   likelihood (ML) decoder. Simulation results show that the proposed
   algorithm exhibits higher decoding efficiency compared with other
   existing ML decoders.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of morphology on the dc conductivity sigma(dc), the charge
   carrier density n and the out-of-plane mobilities mu were investigated
   in conjugated polymer films of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) using
   impedance spectroscopy (IS). IS was used for the first time to discern
   this information from P3HT films. Values of mu, which were found to be
   film-thickness dependent, increasing with increasing film thickness, h,
   for films of thickness h > 700 nm, are in excellent agreement with those
   measured using time-of-flight (ToF) and the method of charge extraction
   by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV). Both sigma(dc) and n are shown
   to decrease appreciably with increasing h. The thickness dependent
   trends in mu, sigma(dc) and n are consistent with changes in the
   morphology of these films. Conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM)
   provided corroborating information, showing an appreciable dependence of
   carrier transport on the morphology of P3HT.}},

Title = {{Performance assessment in brain-computer interface-based augmentative
   and alternative communication}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{A large number of incommensurable metrics are currently used to report
   the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) used for augmentative
   and alterative communication (AAC). The lack of standard metrics
   precludes the comparison of different BCI-based AAC systems, hindering
   rapid growth and development of this technology. This paper presents a
   review of the metrics that have been used to report performance of BCIs
   used for AAC from January 2005 to January 2012. We distinguish between
   Level 1 metrics used to report performance at the output of the BCI
   Control Module, which translates brain signals into logical control
   output, and Level 2 metrics at the Selection Enhancement Module, which
   translates logical control to semantic control. We recommend that: (1)
   the commensurate metrics Mutual Information or Information Transfer Rate
   (ITR) be used to report Level 1 BCI performance, as these metrics
   represent information throughput, which is of interest in BCIs for AAC;
   2) the BCI-Utility metric be used to report Level 2 BCI performance, as
   it is capable of handling all current methods of improving BCI
   performance; (3) these metrics should be supplemented by information
   specific to each unique BCI configuration; and (4) studies involving
   Selection Enhancement Modules should report performance at both Level 1
   and Level 2 in the BCI system. Following these recommendations will
   enable efficient comparison between both BCI Control and Selection
   Enhancement Modules, accelerating research and development of BCI-based
   AAC systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the first in a two-part study of the dynamics of long
   pipes towed underwater. In this part, Part 1, the three-dimensional
   equations of motion are derived for the dynamics of the system. Inviscid
   forces are modelled by adapting Lighthill's slender-body work to the
   problem at hand, while the viscous forces are modelled by elaboration of
   Taylor's expressions. The effect of cross-currents is also considered in
   the equations of motion. The pipeline is flexibly connected to the
   towing and trailing vessels via cables at its upstream and downstream
   ends. The cables are modelled as linear springs and the body is assumed
   to be of null buoyancy. The linearized equations of motion and boundary
   conditions are solved in Part 2 by using a finite difference technique,
   and the results are discussed therein. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method of solution based on a finite difference scheme
   is developed, via which the partial differential equations of motion and
   boundary conditions, presented in Part 1, are converted into a set of
   first-order ODEs which are then solved numerically. The mathematical
   model is validated by considering some simplifications which enable us
   to compare the numerical results with the results of short pipes simply
   supported at both ends (pinned-pinned) and subjected to axial flow. A
   typical Argand diagram is then presented for a long pipe ((L) over cap =
   2000 m) which shows the evolution of lowest three eigenfrequencies of
   the system as a function of nondimensional flow velocity (towing speed),
   For the same pipe, the deformation and time-trace diagrams at different
   values of flow velocity are also given. The results show clearly that a
   long pipe towed underwater may lose stability by divergence and at
   higher flow velocities by flutter; the deformation is confined to a
   small segment of the pipe, close to the downstream end. Some numerical
   comparisons are also presented in which the effects of cable stiffness
   and the skin friction coefficient on the onset of instabilities are
   studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inversionless ultralow threshold coherent emission, or polariton lasing,
   can be obtained by spontaneous radiative recombination from a degenerate
   polariton condensate with nonresonant excitation. Such excitation has,
   hitherto, been provided by an optical source. Coherent emission from a
   GaAs-based quantum well microcavity diode with electrical injection is
   observed here. This is achieved by a combination of modulation doping of
   the wells, to invoke polariton-electron scattering, and an applied
   magnetic field in the Faraday geometry to enhance the exciton-polariton
   saturation density. These measures help to overcome the relaxation
   bottleneck and to form a macroscopic and degenerate condensate as
   evidenced by angle-resolved luminescence, light-current characteristics,
   spatial coherence, and output polarization. The experiments were
   performed at 30 K with an applied field of 7 T.}},

Abstract = {{Cell organization, proliferation, and differentiation are impacted by
   diverse cues present in the cellular microenvironment. As a result, the
   surface of a material plays an important role in cellular function.
   Synthetic surfaces may be augmented by physical as well as chemical
   means. In particular, patterning and interfacial gradients may be
   utilized to mitigate the cellular response. Patterning is advantageous
   as it affords control over a range of feature sizes from several
   nanometers to millimeters. Gradients exist in vivo, for instance in stem
   cell niches, and the ability to create interfacial gradients in vitro
   can provide valuable insights into the influence of a series of minute
   surface changes on a single sample. This review focuses on fabrication
   methods for generating micro- and nanoscale surface patterns as well as
   interfacial gradients, the impact of these surface modifications on the
   cellular response, and the advantages and challenges of these surfaces

Abstract = {{The real (complex) minimum semidefinite rank of a graph is the minimum
   rank among all real symmetric (complex Hermitian) positive semidefinite
   matrices that are naturally associated via their zero-nonzero pattern to
   the given graph. In this paper we give an upper bound on the minimum
   semidefinite rank of a graph when the graph is modified from the
   superposition of two graphs by can-celing some number of edges. We also
   provide a lower bound for the minimum semidefinite rank of a graph
   determined by a given cutset. When the complement of the cutset is a
   star forest these lower and upper bounds coincide and we can compute the
   minimum semidefinite rank in terms of smaller graphs. This result
   encompasses the previously known case in which the cut set has order two
   or smaller. Next we provide results for when the cut set has order
   three. Using these results we provide an example where the positive
   semidefinite zero forcing number is strictly greater than the maximum
   positive semidefinite nullity. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The coalescence of self-catalyzed GaN nanowires grown on Si substrates
   has been examined in order to identify the cause of coalescence and to
   characterize the defect structures resulting from it. Coalescence is
   found to occur due to both nanowire crystallographic misalignment and
   initial nanowire proximity independent of the growth conditions. Defects
   occasionally result from coalesced nanowires, and the root cause of
   defect creation is found to be crystallographic misorientation between
   the nanowires. Several different defect structures are identified, and
   the types of defects that may form are found to depend on the degree of
   that misorientation. In the most extreme cases ``zipper{''}-like arrays

Abstract = {{Commercialization of materials utilizing patterned carbon nanotube (CNT)
   forests, such as hierarchical composite structures, dry adhesives, and
   contact probe arrays, will require catalyst patterning techniques that
   do not rely on cleanroom photolithography. We demonstrate the large
   scale patterning of CNT growth catalyst via adaptation of a laser-based
   electrostatic printing process that uses magnetic ink character
   recognition (MICR) toner. The MICR toner contains iron oxide
   nanoparticles that serve as the catalyst for CNT growth, which are
   printed onto a flexible polymer (polyimide) and then transferred to a
   rigid substrate (silicon or alumina) under heat and mechanical pressure.
   Then, the substrate is processed for CNT growth under an atmospheric
   pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) recipe. This process enables
   digital control of patterned CNT growth via the laser intensity, which
   controls the CNT density; and via the grayscale level, which controls
   the pixelation of the image into arrays of micropillars. Moreover,
   virtually any pattern can be designed using standard software (e.g., MS
   Word, AutoCAD, etc.) and printed on demand. Using a standard office
   printer, we realize isolated CNT microstructures as small as 140 mu m
   and isolated catalyst ``pixels{''} as small as 70 mu m (one grayscale
   dot) and determine that individual toner microparticles result in
   features of approximately 5-10 mu m. We demonstrate that grayscale CNT
   patterns can function as dry adhesives and that large-area catalyst
   patterns can be printed directly onto metal foils or transferred to
   ceramic plates. Laser printing therefore shows promise to enable
   high-speed micropatterning of nanoparticle-containing thin films under
   ambient conditions, possibly for a wide variety of nanostructures by
   engineering of toners containing nanoparticles of desired composition,
   size, and shape.}},

Abstract = {{Esophageal adenocarcinoma is rising rapidly in incidence and usually
   develops from Barrett's esophagus, a precursor condition commonly found
   in patients with chronic acid reflux. Premalignant lesions are
   challenging to detect on conventional screening endoscopy because of
   their flat appearance. Molecular changes can be used to improve
   detection of early neoplasia. We have developed a peptide that binds
   specifically to high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. We first
   applied the peptide ex vivo to esophageal specimens from 17 patients to
   validate specific binding. Next, we performed confocal endomicroscopy in
   vivo in 25 human subjects after topical peptide administration and found
   3.8-fold greater fluorescence intensity for esophageal neoplasia
   compared with Barrett's esophagus and squamous epithelium with 75\%
   sensitivity and 97\% specificity. No toxicity was attributed to the
   peptide in either animal or patient studies. Therefore, our
   first-in-human results show that this targeted imaging agent is safe and
   may be useful for guiding tissue biopsy and for early detection of
   esophageal neoplasia and potentially other cancers of epithelial origin,
   such as bladder, colon, lung, pancreas, and stomach.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a Brownian dynamics simulation method with full hydrodynamic
   interactions (HI) to study the recognition kinetics between two
   patterned colloidal spheres. We use a general resistance matrix
   (12{*}12) to describe both the far and near-field hydrodynamics of
   translation, rotation, and translation-rotation coupling between the two
   spheres, adopted from Jeffrey and Onishi {[}J. Fluid Mech. 139, 261
   (1984)]. We apply the method to the specific binding of ``patchy{''}
   spheres, including effects of depletion attraction and
   orientation-specific binding, as are present in ``Janus{''} spheres
   whose surfaces contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces {[}Q. Chen, S.
   C. Bae, and S. Granick, Nature (London) 469, 381 (2011)]. The binding
   times obtained between two non-patterned spheres (of equal or unequal
   diameter) with or without HI extrapolated to infinite dilution are shown
   to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions of the Smoluchowski
   equation. In addition, the binding times for pairs of spheres for three
   cases of surface patterning of the two spheres (uniform-uniform,
   uniform-Janus, and Janus-Janus) are compared with or without rotational
   motion. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We have observed thin film removal from glass substrates after the

   are dependent on film thickness. With decreasing thickness, material
   removal transitions from intra-film separation to removal at the
   Ni-glass interface. The Gaussian energy distribution of the laser pulse
   allows for intra-film separation in the annular region of the crater and
   interface separation in the center. We propose a model to explain these

Abstract = {{Huygens' principle is a well-known concept in electromagnetics that

   electric and magnetic polarization currents to generate prescribed wave

   to develop a beam-refracting surface and a Gaussian-to-Bessel beam

Abstract = {{The smeared crack approach (SCA) is revisited to describe post-peak
   softening in laminated composite materials. First, predictions of the
   SCA are compared against linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) based
   predictions for the debonding of an adhesively bonded double cantilever
   beam. A sensitivity analysis is performed to establish the influence of
   element size and cohesive strength on the load-deflection response. The
   SCA is further validated by studying the in-plane fracture of a
   laminated composite in a single edge bend test configuration. In doing
   so, issues related to mesh size and their effects (or non-effects) are
   discussed and compared against other predictive computational
   techniques. Finally, the SCA is specialized to orthotropic materials.
   The application of the SCA is demonstrated for failure mechanics of the
   open hole tension test, where fiber/matrix fracture is predominant and
   predicted well by the present approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the design of composite materials with
   simultaneously high stiffness and high damping. We consider layered
   composite materials with parallel plane layers made of a stiff
   constituent and a lossy polymer. We analyze the response of these
   composites to a dynamic load with an arbitrary direction. Using the
   viscoelastic correspondence principle and linear frequency domain
   viscoelastic models, we derive an expression for the effective complex
   modulus of layered composites of infinite size at infinitesimal strains.
   The dependence of the effective dynamic modulus and loss factor on the
   geometrical parameters and on the tensile and bulk loss factors of the
   lossy constituent is analyzed. Moreover we determine the magnitude of
   the strains in the lossy constituent and demonstrate that the
   combination of high stiffness and high damping of these composites is
   due to the high normal and/or shear strains in the lossy material. We
   use nonlinear constrained optimization to design layered composites with
   simultaneously high stiffness and high damping while constraining the
   strains in the polymer. To determine the range of validity of the linear
   viscoelastic model, simulations using finite deformations models are
   compared to the theoretical results. Finally, we compute the effective
   properties of composites of finite size using finite element methods and
   determine the minimum size required to approach the formulae derived for
   composites of infinite size. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   engine, for a given fuel. Commercial fuels can differ considerably in
   composition and autoignition chemistry; hence, strategies intended to
   bring HCCI to market must account for this fuel variability. To this
   end, a test matrix consisting of eight gasoline fuels comprised of
   blends made solely from refinery streams were run in an experimental,
   single cylinder HCCI engine. All fuels contained 10\% ethanol by volume
   and were representative of a cross section of fuels one would expect to
   find at gasoline pumps across the United States. The properties of the
   fuels were varied according to research octane number (RON), sensitivity
   (S - RON-MON), and volumetric content of aromatics and olefins. For each
   fuel, a sweep of load (mass of fuel injected per cycle) was conducted
   and the intake air temperature was adjusted in order to keep the crank
   angle of the 50\% mass fraction burned point (CA50) constant. By
   analyzing the amount of temperature compensation required to maintain
   constant combustion phasing, it was possible to determine the
   sensitivity of HCCI to changes in load for various fuels. In addition,
   the deviation of fuel properties brought about variations in important
   engine performance metrics like specific fuel consumption. Though the
   injected energy content per cycle was matched at the baseline point
   across the test fuel matrix, thermodynamic differences resulted in a
   spread of specific fuel consumption for the fuels tested.}},

Abstract = {{A simulation study was performed to evaluate the potential fuel economy
   benefits of integrating a dual-mode SI-HCCI engine into various vehicle
   architectures. The vehicle configurations that were considered include a
   conventional vehicle and a mild parallel hybrid electric vehicle. The
   two configurations were modeled and compared in detail for a given
   engine size (2.0 L) over the EPA UDDS (city) and highway cycles. The
   results show that the dual-mode engine in the conventional vehicle
   offers a modest gain in vehicle fuel economy of approximately 5-7\%. The
   gains were modest because the baseline (the SI engine in the
   conventional vehicle) is relatively advanced with a six-speed automated
   manual transmission. The mild parallel hybrid with the SI engine
   achieved 32\% better fuel economy than the conventional vehicle in the
   city, but only 6\% on the highway. For the dual-mode engine in the mild
   parallel hybrid, a specific control strategy was used to manipulate
   engine operation in an attempt to minimize the number of engine mode
   transitions and maximize the time spent in HCCI. The parallel hybrid
   with the dual-mode engine and modified control strategy provides
   dramatic improvements of up to 48\% for city driving, demonstrating that
   the addition of HCCI has a more significant impact with mild parallel
   hybrids than with conventional vehicles. Finally, a systematic study of
   engine sizing provides guidelines for selecting the best option for a
   given vehicle application.}},

Abstract = {{Load flow visualization, which is an important step in structural and
   machine assembly design may aid in the analysis and eventual synthesis
   of compliant mechanisms. In this paper, we present a kineto-static
   formulation to visualize load flow in compliant mechanisms. This
   formulation uses the concept of transferred forces to quantify load flow
   from input to the output of a compliant mechanism. The magnitude and
   direction of load flow in the constituent members enables functional
   decomposition of the compliant mechanism into (i) Constraints (C):
   members that are constrained to deform in a particular direction and
   (ii) Transmitters (T): members that transmit load to the output.
   Furthermore, it is shown that a constraint member and an adjacent
   transmitter member can be grouped together to constitute a fundamental
   building block known as an CT set whose load flow behavior is maximally
   decoupled from the rest of the mechanism. We can thereby explain the
   deformation behavior of a number of compliant mechanisms from literature
   by visualizing load flow, and identifying building blocks.}},

Abstract = {{The VIVACE converter was introduced at OMAE2006 as a single, smooth,
   circular-cylinder module. The hydrodynamics of VIVACE is being improved
   continuously to achieve higher density in harnessed hydrokinetic power.
   Intercylinder spacing and passive turbulence control (PTC) through
   selectively located roughness are effective tools in enhancement of flow
   induced motions (FIMs) under high damping for power harnessing. Single
   cylinders harness energy at high density even in 1 knot currents. For
   downstream cylinders, questions were raised on energy availability and
   sustainability of high-amplitude FIM. Through PTC and intercylinder
   spacing, strongly synergetic FIMs of 2/3/4 cylinders are achieved.
   Two-cylinder smooth/PTC, and three/four-cylinder PTC systems are tested
   experimentally. Using the ``PTC-to-FIM{''} map developed in previous
   work at the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory (MRELab), PTC is applied
   and cylinder response is measured for inflow center-to-center distance
   2D-5D (D diameter), transverse center-to-center distance 0.5-1.5 D, Re

   free surface water (LTFSW) channel of MRELab. Amplitude spectra and
   broad field-of-view (FOV) visualization help reveal complex flow
   structures and cylinder interference undergoing VIV,
   interference/proximity/wake/soft/hard galloping. FIM amplitudes of
   2.2-2.8D are achieved for all cylinders in steady flow for all parameter
   ranges tested.}},

Abstract = {{Significant synergy exists between plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and
   wind energy: PEVs can be the demand response to mitigate the
   intermittent wind power outputs, and wind energy can provide low-carbon
   electricity to PEVs. This paper presents a hierarchical control
   algorithm to realize this synergy by integrating the PEV charging and
   wind power scheduling. The control algorithm consists of three levels:
   the top-level controller optimizes the scheduling for the conventional
   power plants and wind power; the middle-level controller plans PEV
   charging to achieve load following based on the battery state of charge
   and plug-off time of each vehicle; the bottom-level controller uses grid
   electricity frequency as the feedback cue to control PEV charging and
   serves as the ancillary service to the grid. Numerical simulations show
   that the integrated controller can improve the grid frequency regulation
   and overall electricity generation cost without sacrificing the PEVs
   charging completion.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) was proposed in the 1960s as a low-cost
   alternative to conventional binary computing. It is unique in that it
   represents and processes information in the form of digitized
   probabilities. SC employs very low-complexity arithmetic units which was
   a primary design concern in the past. Despite this advantage and also
   its inherent error tolerance, SC was seen as impractical because of very
   long computation times and relatively low accuracy. However, current
   technology trends tend to increase uncertainty in circuit behavior and
   imply a need to better understand, and perhaps exploit, probability in
   computation. This article surveys SC from a modern perspective where the
   small size, error resilience, and probabilistic features of SC may
   compete successfully with conventional methodologies in certain
   applications. First, we survey the literature and review the key
   concepts of stochastic number representation and circuit structure. We
   then describe the design of SC-based circuits and evaluate their
   advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we give examples of the potential
   applications of SC and discuss some practical problems that are yet to
   be solved.}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltenes are the heaviest and most polar fraction of crude oil. They
   can precipitate at any point of oil production or transportation as a
   result of changes in the temperature, pressure, or composition. Their
   precipitation and deposition are having a serious economic impact on
   petroleum production. It was previously shown that that the
   precipitation of asphaltenes is a kinetic phenomenon. In this work, it
   is demonstrated that the kinetics of precipitation is universal among
   many different crude oils. However, the aggregation rates strongly
   depend upon the properties of the crude oil or the solvent used to
   stabilize asphaltenes. A new method of analysis is developed to estimate
   the aggregation rates by accounting for the properties governing the
   aggregation kinetics using Smoluchowski's aggregation model. It is shown
   that the viscosity and solubility parameter of the solution play an
   important role in controlling the aggregation behavior of asphaltenes in
   different crude oils and different model oils. However, with certain key
   assumptions in the kinetic analysis, all disparities in the aggregation
   rates of asphaltenes for different types of asphaltenes and crude oils
   disappear and the rates collapse onto a single curve. These findings
   will lead to a better understanding of the properties that govern the
   destabilization and growth processes, which can, in turn, give rise to
   new predictive models to foresee precipitation kinetics under different
   operational conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Novel parametric reduced-order models are proposed for fast reanalysis
   to predict the dynamic response of complex structures, which suffered
   thickness variations caused by design changes or damage in one or more
   substructures. Parametric reduced-order models developed previously have
   two important challenges to overcome to improve accuracy and
   performance: (a) the transformation matrix is not mathematically stable
   and (b) the Taylor series parameterization techniques do not capture
   thickness variations of the structure modeled with solid-type elements
   due to the highly nonlinear dependence on thickness changes. Thus,
   herein, a new transformation matrix and novel parameterization
   techniques are proposed. Usual reduced-order models have an additional
   challenge, namely the difficulty in reducing the interface degrees of
   freedom. Thus a way of reducing the interface degrees of freedom is also
   proposed. The predicted vibration responses of complex structures are
   shown to agree very well with results obtained using a much more
   computationally expensive commercial tool. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper studies the optimal control policy for capacitated

   convexity and lattice analysis, we show that, for systems with a
   remanufacturing capacity and a manufacturing/total capacity, the optimal
   remanufacturing policy is a modified remanufacture-down-to policy and
   the optimal manufacturing policy is a modified total-up-to policy. Our
   study reveals that the optimal policies always give production priority
   to remanufacturing for systems with a remanufacturing capacity and/or a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The epitaxial growth of high-quality ZnTe on GaSb substrates is
   demonstrated by molecular beam epitaxy without the use of a group-V beam
   flux or intermediate GaSb buffer layer. A reduced surface cleaning
   temperature is achieved using a combination of HCl etching prior to
   loading into the growth chamber and use of a ZnCl2 flux during the
   thermal clean step. This procedure results in a surface clean
   temperature of approximately 440 degrees C, in comparison to 500 degrees
   C for an as-received GaSb substrate, providing a means to achieve a
   clean GaSb surface for ZnTe epitaxy without the requirement for a
   group-V flux to stabilize the surface to prevent noncongruent
   sublimation of GaSb. The resulting ZnTe epitaxial layers demonstrate
   good surface morphology and structural properties based on Nomarski
   microscope images, transmission electron microscopy images of the
   ZnTe/GaSb interface, and x-ray diffraction measurements demonstrating a
   rocking curve with a full width at half maximum of 40 arc sec for the
   ZnTe (004) reflection. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the Coulomb spike model, track formation depends strongly on
   the electrical resistivity of a material, and ion tracks form only in
   insulating materials. However, there are no systemic studies of the
   effect of resistivity on the track formation in materials, such as
   SrTiO3 (STO), where with the addition of low concentrations of Nb, the
   resistivity dramatically decreases covering the entire electronic regime
   from an insulating to conducting material. In this study, high energy
   (8.6 MeV/u) ion-induced track formation in STO was characterized by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering
   (SAXS) techniques as a function of Nb-doping concentrations. Contrary to
   the Coulomb spike model's predictions, the Nb-doping had no evident
   influence on track formation, as confirmed by both TEM and SAXS. This
   may be the result of the low electron density in the bulk material or
   the minor effect of the Nb-doping on the bonding in the material. In
   situ TEM studies of low energy (1 MeV Kr2+) ion irradiations show that
   the low concentration doping has a minor influence on the
   crystalline-to-amorphous transformation as a result of subtle structural
   variations of incorporated impurity atoms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Due to the ease of setting up a Wi-Fi hotspot and the availability of
   readily configurable mobile operating systems, Wi-Fi tethering can be
   abused by misbehaving users to gain an unfair advantage in throughput
   performance. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting selfish
   nodes in Wi-Fi tethering environments. In particular, selfish nodes can
   manipulate carrier sensing thresholds to exploit recent advances in
   physical-layer concurrent transmission technologies as well as short
   link distance in a tethered network so as to achieve unfair throughput
   gains while evading detection. We propose a new MAC-layer detection
   algorithm based on frame sequence numbers that accurately detects

Abstract = {{In thin film A/B polymer/polymer mixtures, the formation of a layer at
   the free surface, with average composition that differs from the bulk,
   due to the preferential segregation of the lower cohesive energy density
   component, is well understood. While much is also understood about this
   surface layer formation and growth to date, virtually nothing is known
   about the surface dynamics of the chains in such mixtures. Questions
   about the surface chain dynamics in relation to the bulk have remained
   unanswered. With the use of X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS)
   we show that the dynamics of poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) chains at
   the free surface of polystyrene (PS)/PVME thin film mixtures can be
   orders of magnitude larger than the PVME chains in the bulk. These
   dynamics manifest from differences between the local compositions of the
   blend at the free surface and the bulk, as well as film thickness
   constraints}},

Abstract = {{Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is a futuristic
   combustion technology that operates with high efficiency and reduced
   emissions. HCCI combustion is characterized by complex nonlinear
   dynamics which necessitates the use of a predictive model in controller
   design. Developing a physics based model for HCCI involves significant
   development times and associated costs arising from developing
   simulation models and calibration. In this paper, a neural networks (NN)
   based methodology is reported where black box type models are developed
   to predict HCCI combustion behavior during transient operation. The NN
   based approach can be considered a low cost and quick alternative to the
   traditional physics based modeling. A multi-input single-output model
   was developed each for indicated net mean effective pressure, combustion
   phasing, maximum in-cylinder pressure rise rate and equivalent air-fuel
   ratio. The two popular architectures namely multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
   and radial basis network (RBN) models were compared with respect to
   design, prediction performance and overall applicability to the
   transient HCCI modeling problem. A principal component analysis (PCA) is
   done as a pre-processing step to reduce input dimension thereby reducing
   memory requirements of the models. Also, PCA reduces the
   cross-validation time required to identify optimal model
   hyper-parameters. On comparing the model predictions with the
   experimental data, it was shown that neural networks can be a powerful
   approach for non-linear identification of a complex combustion system
   like the HCCI engine. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrothermal liquefaction of algae biomass is a promising technology for
   the production of sustainable biofuels, but the non-oil, aqueous
   co-product of the process has only been examined to a limited extent.
   The aqueous phase from liquefaction of the alga Nannochloropsis oculata
   (AqAl) was used to make growth media for model heterotrophic
   microorganisms Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae. Growth rates, yields, and carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus uptake
   were measured. E. coli and P. putida could grow using AqAl as the sole
   C, N, and P source in media containing 10 vol.\%-40 vol.\% AqAl with the
   best growth occurring at 20 vol.\%. S. cerevisiae could grow under these
   conditions only if the media were supplemented with glucose. The results
   indicate that in a biorefinery utilizing algae liquefaction, the aqueous
   co-product may be recycled via microbial cultures with significantly
   less dilution than previously published methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the production of biodiesel from wet, lipid-rich
   algal biomass using a two-step process involving hydrothermal
   carbonization (HTC) and supercritical in situ transesterification
   (SC-IST). Algal hydrochars produced by HTC were reacted in supercritical
   ethanol to determine the effects of reaction temperature, time, ethanol
   loading, water content, and pressure on the yield of fatty acid ethyl
   esters (FAEE). Reaction temperatures above 275 degrees C resulted in
   substantial thermal decomposition of unsaturated FAEE, thereby reducing
   yields. At 275 degrees C, time and ethanol loading had a positive impact
   on FAEE yield while increasing reaction water content and pressure
   reduced yields. FAEE yields as high as 79\% with a 5:1 ethanol:fatty
   acid (EtOH:FA) molar ratio (150 min) and 89\% with a 20:1 EtOH:FA molar
   ratio (180 min) were achieved. This work demonstrates that nearly all
   lipids within algal hydrochars can be converted into biodiesel through
   SC-IST with only a small excess of alcohol. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The mechanical environment is a key regulator of function
   in cardiomyocytes. We studied the role of substrate stiffness on the
   organization of sarcomeres and costameres in adult rat cardiomyocytes
   and further examined the resulting changes in cell shortening and
   calcium dynamics.
   Methods: Cardiomyocytes isolated from adult rats were plated on
   laminin-coated polydimethylsiloxane substrates of defined stiffness (255
   kPa, 117 kPa, 27 kPa, and 7 kPa) for 48 h. Levels of alpha-actinin and
   pi integrins were determined by immunofluoresence imaging and
   immunoblotting, both in the absence and presence of the phosphatase
   inhibitor calyculin A. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
   chain reaction was used to measure message levels of key structural
   proteins (alpha-actinin, alpha 7 integrin, beta 1 integrin, vinculin).
   Sarcomere shortening and calcium dynamics were measured at 2, 24, and 48
   h.
   Results: Overall cardiomyocyte morphology was similar on all substrates.
   However, well organized sarcomere structures were observed on only the
   stiffest (255 kPa) and the most compliant (7 kPa) substrates. Levels of
   alpha-actinin in cells were the same on all substrates, while message
   levels of structural proteins were up-regulated on substrates of
   intermediate stiffness. Inhibition of phosphatase activity blocked the
   degradation of contractile structures, but altered overall cardiomyocyte
   morphology. Shortening and calcium dynamics also were dependent on
   substrate stiffness; however, there was no clear causative relationship
   between the phenomena.
   Conclusions: Extracellular matrix stiffness can affect structural
   remodeling by adult cardiomyocytes, and the resulting contractile
   activity. These findings illuminate changes in cardiomyocyte function in
   cardiac fibrosis, and may suggest cardiac-specific phosphatases as a
   target for therapeutic intervention (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{This manuscript presents a systematic investigation of the response of a
   Burgers' viscoelastic fluid model with stress-dependent material
   parameters. Such a model has been used extensively in geomechanics as
   well as to describe the response of materials like asphalt. The stress,
   strain, and time relation of Burgers' fluid model is expressed with
   second order differential operators applied to the stress and strain.
   The nonlinearity is due to the stress dependence of the material
   parameters, i.e., the fluid viscosity and the parameter related to the
   characteristic time. We impose discontinuity conditions, whose necessity
   was not recognized until the recent work of Prusa and Rajagopal (2011),
   for the stress and strain and also for the stress- and strain rates such
   that we satisfy the following assumptions: if there is a jump
   discontinuity in strain there should be a jump discontinuity in the
   corresponding stress, and if there is a small change in strain there
   ought to be a small change in the corresponding stress. These
   assumptions are also applied when a stress history is considered as
   input. We present constraints on the stress-dependent material functions
   in order to obtain a physically meaningful solution that describes the
   viscoelastic response of materials. We also allow different responses
   for tension and compression and perform parametric studies geared
   towards obtaining an understanding of the effect of nonlinear
   stress-dependent functions on the stress-relaxation and creep
   deformation under various loading histories. It is important to
   recognize that methods such as time-temperature superposition or the use
   of Laplace transforms that are useful in the case of the classical
   linear viscoelastic material will not work in the case of the non-linear
   model considered in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilms are microbial communities that are characterized by the
   presence of a viscoelastic extracellular polymeric substance (EPS).
   Studies have shown that polysaccharides, along with proteins and DNA,
   are a major constituent of the EPS and play a dominant role in mediating
   its microstructure and rheological properties. Here, we investigate the
   possibility of entanglements and associative complexes in solutions of
   extracellular polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) extracted from
   Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms. We report that the weight average
   molar mass and radius of gyration of PIA isolates are 2.01 X 10(5) +/-
   1200 g/mol and 29.2 +/- 1.2 nm, respectively. The coil overlap
   concentration, c{*}, was thus determined to be (32 +/- 4) X 10(-4) g/mL.
   Measurements of the in situ concentration of PIA (c(PIA,biofilm)) was
   found to be (10 +/- 2) x 10(-4) g/mL. Thus, c(PIA,biofilm) < c{*} and
   the amount of PIA in the biofilm is too low to cause polymer chain
   entanglements. In the pH range 3.0-5.5, PIA was found to both
   self-associate and to form complexes with bovine serum albumin (BSA). By
   static light scattering, both self-association and complex formation
   with 0.5\% (w/v) BSA were found to occur at PIA concentrations of 0.30 X
   10(-4) g/mL and greater, which is about 30 times lower than the measured
   c(PIA,biofilm). These results suggest that the microscopic origin of EPS
   viscoelasticity is unlikely to be due to polysaccharide entanglements.
   Furthermore, the onset of self-association and protein complexation of
   PIA occurs at concentrations far lower than the native PIA concentration
   in biofilms. This finding therefore suggests a critical role for those
   two association mechanisms in mediating biofilm viscoelasticity.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the synthesis of optimal liveness-enforcing control
   policies for Gadara nets, a special class of Petri nets that arises in
   the modeling of the execution of multithreaded computer programs for the
   purpose of deadlock avoidance. We consider maximal permissiveness as the
   notion of optimality. Deadlock-freeness of a multithreaded program
   corresponds to liveness of its Gadara net model. We present a new
   control synthesis algorithm for liveness enforcement of Gadara nets that
   need not be ordinary. The algorithm employs structural analysis of the
   net and synthesizes monitor places to prevent the formation of a special
   class of siphons, termed resource-induced deadly-marked siphons. The
   algorithm also accounts for uncontrollable transitions in the net in a
   minimally restrictive manner. The algorithm is generally an iterative
   process and converges in a finite number of iterations. It exploits a
   covering of the unsafe states that is updated at each iteration. The
   proposed algorithm is shown to be correct and maximally permissive with
   respect to the goal of liveness enforcement.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum is an attractive energy storage material for underwater
   propulsion because of its high density and strongly exothermic reaction
   with seawater. However, the degree to which an aluminum-seawater power
   system could outperform other systems has remained unknown because of
   uncertainties about volume and energy costs associated with the balance
   of plant. This work addresses this problem by developing a thermodynamic
   model for a complete Rankine-cycle propulsion system based ob the
   aluminum-seawater reaction and combining this with a scaling methodology
   for inferring the system's effective energy density. The results show
   that replacing battery-based power systems with aluminum combustion
   based ones could increase range/endurance by factors of four to ten over
   competing technologies. Overall system efficiency is maximized by
   adjusting the water mass flow to fuel mass flow ratio so as to control
   the temperature and quantity of steam. Although increasing the amount of
   combustion byproduct, hydrogen, improves the performance of the turbine,
   the thermodynamic cost of compressing the hydrogen can be very high. As
   a result, developing a compact device for achieving an isothermal
   compression of waste hydrogen is necessary to fully realize the energy
   density advantage of the aluminum fuel.}},

Abstract = {{Surfaces that display liquid contact angles greater than 150 degrees
   along with low contact angle hysteresis for liquids with both high and
   low surface tension values are known as superomniphobic surfaces. Such
   surfaces are of interest for a diverse array of applications, including
   self-cleaning surfaces, nonfouling surfaces, stain-free clothing,
   spill-resistant protective wear, drag reduction, and
   fingerprint-resistant surfaces. Recently, significant advances have been
   made in understanding the criteria required to design superomniphobic
   surfaces. In this article, we discuss the roles of surface energy,
   roughness, re-entrant texture, and hierarchical structure in fabricating
   superomniphobic surfaces. We also provide a review of different
   superomniphobic surfaces reported recently in the literature and
   emphasize the need for mechanical, chemical, and radiation durability of
   superomniphobic surfaces for practical applications. Finally, we
   conclude with a discussion of the unresolved challenges in developing
   durable superomniphobic surfaces that define the scope for further
   improvements in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Ferritic chromium steels are important structural materials for future
   nuclear fission and fusion reactors due to their advantages over
   traditional austenitic steels, such as higher thermal fatigue
   resistance, lower thermal expansion coefficients and reduced swelling.
   However radiation-induced segregation or depletion (RIS/RID) of solute
   atoms at grain boundaries in these materials is a concern because these
   phenomena could adversely affect their mechanical properties. In an
   effort to develop a full mechanistic understanding of RIS/RID, a
   systematic approach combining orientation imaging, site-specific
   specimen preparation and three-dimensional atomic-scale analysis has
   been developed to characterize the behaviour of Cr and C at grain
   boundaries during irradiation. This methodology has been applied to a
   Fe-15.2 at.\% Cr alloy to investigate the effects of grain boundary
   misorientation, irradiation depth and impurities. Systematic differences
   in Cr segregation are reported as a function of grain boundary character
   and irradiation conditions. The similar properties demonstrated by grain
   boundaries of similar type means that it should be possible to apply
   relatively simple models to predict the long-term behaviour of these
   materials under irradiation conditions. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

   Brazil). Existing FFVs rely on ethanol sensor installed in the vehicle
   fueling system, or on an ethanol estimation based on air-to-fuel ratio
   (AFR) regulation via an exhaust gas oxygen (EGO) or lambda sensor. The
   EGO-based ethanol detection is desirable from cost and maintenance
   perspectives but it is known to be prone to large errors during mass air
   flow sensor drifts. Ethanol content estimation can be realized by a
   feedback-based fuel correction of the feedforward-based fuel calculation
   using an exhaust gas oxygen sensor. When the fuel correction is
   attributed to the difference in stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio (SAFR)
   between ethanol and gasoline, it can be used for ethanol estimation.
   When the fuel correction is attributed to a mass air flow (MAF) sensor
   error, it can be used for sensor drift estimation and correction.
   Deciding under which condition to blame (and detect) ethanol and when to
   switch to sensor correction burdens the calibration of FFV engine
   controllers. Moreover, erroneous decisions can lead to biases in ethanol
   estimation and in MAF sensor correction. In this paper, we present
   AFR-based ethanol content estimation, associated sensitivity and
   dynamical analysis, and a cylinder air flow estimation scheme that
   accounts for MAF sensor drift or bias using an intake manifold absolute
   pressure (MAP) sensor. The proposed fusion of the MAF, MAP, and lambda
   sensor measurements prevents severe misestimation of ethanol content in
   flex fuel vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops techniques to design plug-in hybrid electric vehicle
   (PHEV) power management algorithms that optimally balance lithium-ion
   battery pack health and energy consumption cost. As such, this research
   is the first to utilize electrochemical battery models to optimize the
   power management in PHEVs. Daily trip length distributions are
   integrated into the problem using Markov chains with absorbing states.
   We capture battery aging by integrating two example degradation models:
   solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) film formation and the
   ``Ah-processed{''} model. This enables us to optimally tradeoff energy
   cost versus battery-health. We analyze this tradeoff to explore how
   optimal control strategies and physical battery system properties are
   related. Specifically, we find that the slope and convexity properties
   of the health degradation model profoundly impact the optimal charge
   depletion strategy. For example, solutions that balance energy cost and
   SEI layer growth aggressively deplete battery charge at high
   states-of-charge (SoCs), then blend engine and battery power at lower
   SoCs.}},

Abstract = {{For the forced-circulation evaporation process of alumina production,
   the control objectives include maintaining the liquid level and fast
   tracking of the product density with respect to its setpoint. However,
   with the strong coupling between the level control and product density
   control loops and the process exhibits strong nonlinearities,
   conventional control strategies, such as
   proportional-integral-derivative and other linear control design, cannot
   achieve satisfactory control performance and meet production demands. By
   augmenting the forced-circulation evaporation system model with dynamics
   of its operating valves, a nonlinear adaptive decoupling switching
   control strategy is proposed. This control strategy includes a linear
   adaptive decoupling controller, a neural-network-based nonlinear
   adaptive decoupling controller, and a switching mechanism. The linear
   adaptive decoupling controller is used to reduce the coupling between
   the two control loops. The neural-network-based nonlinear adaptive
   decoupling controller is employed to improve the transient performance
   and reduce the effects of the nonlinearities on the system, and the
   switching mechanism is introduced to guarantee the input-output
   stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results show that the
   proposed method can decouple the loops effectively for the
   forced-circulation evaporation system and thus improve the evaporation
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The fluid interactions produced by a sonic reaction-control-system
   thruster are investigated using computational fluid dynamics. The study
   uses a scaled Mars Science Laboratory aeroshell at a 20 deg angle of
   attack in Mach 12 flow of I-2-seeded N-2 gas. The
   reaction-control-system jet is directed either parallel or transverse to
   the freestream flow to examine the effects of the thruster orientation.
   The results show that both the parallel and transverse
   reaction-control-system jets obstruct the flow around the aeroshell and
   impinge on the surface, increasing the overall pressure along the
   aftbody. As a result, the reaction-control-system jet decreases the
   drag, lift, and moment acting on the aeroshell, particularly at
   relatively large reaction-control-system thrust conditions. The results
   also indicate that the fluid interactions produced by the parallel and
   transverse jets affect the control effectiveness of the reaction control
   system. The performance of the parallel reaction-control-system thruster
   is close to ideal due to relatively small aerodynamic interference
   induced by the jet. However, the relatively large aerodynamic
   interference produced by the transverse reaction-control-system jet
   causes a deficit of control authority. The physical accuracy of the
   computational method is assessed by comparing the numerical results with
   experimental visualizations.}},

Abstract = {{This is the fifth paper in a series on the experimental characterization

   use of digital image correlation (DIC) to measure the strain field on
   the surface of the wire. After a brief overview of the principles and
   mathematics behind DIC, two different thermo-mechanical tension tests
   using DIC are presented to demonstrate the technique. The first
   experiment consists of Joule heating a shape memory (SM) wire to induce
   the shape memory effect, using 2-D DIC to measure the strain field. The
   second experiment measures the response of a superelastic (SE) wire to
   mechanical cycling at room temperature, using 3-D DIC to measure the
   strain field and an infrared camera to measure the temperature field. In
   addition to describing the experimental results, attention is paid to
   specimen preparation and the two experimental setups. Many of the
   challenges and precautions associated with using DIC are discussed,

Abstract = {{To reduce blur in noisy images, regularized image restoration methods
   have been proposed that use nonquadratic regularizers (like l(1)
   regularization or total-variation) that suppress noise while preserving
   edges in the image. Most of these methods assume a circulant blur
   (periodic convolution with a blurring kernel) that can lead to
   wraparound artifacts along the boundaries of the image due to the
   implied periodicity of the circulant model. Using a noncirculant model
   could prevent these artifacts at the cost of increased computational
   complexity. In this paper, we propose to use a circulant blur model
   combined with a masking operator that prevents wraparound artifacts. The
   resulting model is noncirculant, so we propose an efficient algorithm
   using variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian (AL) strategies. Our
   variable splitting scheme, when combined with the AL framework and
   alternating minimization, leads to simple linear systems that can be
   solved noniteratively using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), eliminating
   the need for more expensive conjugate gradient-type solvers. The
   proposed method can also efficiently tackle a variety of convex
   regularizers, including edge-preserving (e. g., total-variation) and
   sparsity promoting (e. g., l(1)-norm) regularizers. Simulation results
   show fast convergence of the proposed method, along with improved image
   quality at the boundaries where the circulant model is inaccurate.}},

Abstract = {{Deteriorated equipment has a significant impact on the product quality
   and maintenance policies. In this paper, we present a decision-making
   architecture to determine maintenance and product dispatching policies
   based on condition-monitoring information and the relationship between
   machine degradation and associated product quality. We use a Markov
   decision process for the long-term decision making and integer
   programming for the short-term decision making with a multi-product,
   multi-station system. We demonstrate the advantage of the proposed
   approach by comparing the proposed policy with traditional
   decision-making approaches. Furthermore, we illustrate the improvement
   of the proposed policy over the current usage-based maintenance policy
   with a semiconductor manufacturing process application.}},

Abstract = {{Cutaneous information from joints has been attributed proprioceptive
   properties similar to those of muscle spindles. This study aimed to
   assess whether vibration-induced changes in torso cutaneous information
   contribute to whole-body postural reorganization in humans. Ten healthy
   young adults stood in normal and Romberg stances with six vibrating
   actuators positioned on the torso in contact with the skin over the left
   and right external oblique, internal oblique, and erector spinae muscle
   locations at the L4/L5 vertebrae level. Vibrations around the torso were
   randomly applied at two locations simultaneously (covibration) or at all
   locations simultaneously. Kinematic analysis of the body segments
   indicated that covibration applied to the skin over the internal oblique
   muscles induced shifts of both the head and torso in the anterior
   direction (torso flexion) while the hips shifted in the posterior
   direction (ankle plantar flexion). Conversely, covibration applied to
   the skin over the erector spinae muscle locations produced opposite
   effects. However, covibration applied to the skin over the left internal
   oblique and left erector spinae, the right internal oblique and right
   erector spinae, or at all locations simultaneously did not induce any
   significant postural changes. In addition, the center of pressure
   position as measured by the force plate was unaffected by all
   covibration conditions tested. These results were independent of stance
   and suggest an integrated and coordinated reorganization of posture in
   response to vibration-induced changes in cutaneous information. In
   addition, combinations of vibrotactile stimuli over multiple locations
   exhibit directional summation properties in contrast to the individual
   responses we observed in our previous work.}},

Abstract = {{Five bulk samples of n-type Zr0.25Hf0.75NiSn0.975Sb0.025 half-Heusler
   (HH) alloy were fabricated by reacting elemental powders via (1) high
   temperature solid state (SS) reaction and (2) mechanical alloying (MA),
   followed by densification using spark plasma sintering (SPS) and/or hot
   pressing (HP). A portion of the sample obtained by SS reaction was
   mechanically alloyed before consolidation by hot pressing (SS-MA-HP).
   X-ray powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy studies
   revealed that all SS specimen (SS-SPS, SS-HP, SS-MA-HP) are single phase
   HI-I alloys, whereas the MA sample (MA-SPS) contains metallic
   nanoprecipitates. Electronic and thermal transport measurements showed
   that the embedded nanoprecipitates induce a drastic increase in the
   carrier concentration (n), a large decrease in the Seebeck coefficient
   (S) and a marginal decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity
   (kappa(l)) of the MA-SPS sample leading to lower ZT values when compared
   to the SS-HP samples. Constant values of S are observed for the SS
   series regardless of the processing method. However, a strong dependence
   of the carrier mobility (mu), electrical conductivity (sigma) and
   kappa(l) on the processing and consolidation method is observed. For
   instance, mechanical alloying introduces additional structural defects
   which enhance electron and phonon scattering leading to moderately low
   values of mu and large reduction in kappa(l). This results in a net 20\%
   enhancement in the figure of merit (ZT=0.6 at 775 K). HH specimen of the
   same nominal composition with higher ZT is anticipated from a
   combination of SS reaction, MA and SPS (SS-MA-SPS). (C) 2013 Elsevier

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{The current paper uses the Extended Kantorovich Method (EKM) to
   analytically solve the problem of squeezed film damping in micromirrors.
   First a one term Galerkin approximation is used and following the
   extended Kantorovich procedure, the solution of the Reynolds equation
   which governs the squeezed film damping in micromirrors is reduced to
   solution of two uncoupled ordinary differential equation which can be
   solved iteratively with a rapid convergence for finding the pressure
   distribution underneath the micromirror. It is shown that the EKM
   results are independent of the initial guess function. It is also shown
   that EKM is highly convergent and practically one iterate is sufficient
   for obtaining a precise response. Furthermore using the presented closed
   form solutions for the squeezed film damping torque, it is proved that
   when the tilting angle of the mirror is small, the damping is linear
   viscous one, while when the tilting angle is finite, the damping would
   be linearly proportional with the angular velocity of the mirror and at
   the same time it is a nonlinear function of the tilting angle of the
   mirror. Results of this paper can be used for accurate dynamical
   simulation of micromirrors with presence of the squeezed film damping.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of adult stem cells can be influenced by physical cues,
   including nanotopography. However, the response of human embryonic stem
   cells (hESCs) to dimensionally well-defined nanotopography is unknown.
   Using imprint lithography, we prepared well-defined nanotopography of
   hexagonal (HEX) and honeycomb (HNY) configurations with various spacings
   between the nanostructures. In serum-free hESC culture medium, basic
   fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is required to maintain expression of
   Oct4, a pluripotent gene. Unexpectedly, hESCs cultured on nanotopography
   could maintain Oct4 expression without bFGF supplementation. With bFGF
   supplementation, the HEX nanotopography maintained Oct4 expression
   whereas the HNY configuration caused down-regulation of Oct4 expression.
   Thus, we observed that the lattice configurations of the nanotopography
   cause hESCs to respond to bFGF in different ways. This differential
   response to a biochemical cue by nanotopography was unforeseen, but its
   discovery could lead to novel differentiation pathways. Consistent with
   studies of other cells, we observed that nanotopography affects focal
   adhesion formation in hESCs. We posit that this can in turn affect
   cell-matrix tension, focal adhesion kinase signaling and integrin-growth
   factor receptor crosstalk, which eventually modulates Oct4 expression in
   hESCs. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Age- and sex-specific estimates of serum dioxin concentrations are
   important for comparisons among populations. However, such comparisons
   are problematic because populations have different age and sex
   structures and values are typically reported only in broad age ranges
   that are not comparable across studies. There are few studies that
   report congener-specific serum concentrations, and none that provide
   these by sex for age as a continuous function. We combined the NHANES
   2003-2004 data with the University of Michigan Dioxin Exposure Study
   (UMDES) referent population 2005 data to achieve stable and accurate
   estimates of mean and quantiles of serum dioxins by sex over ages 18-85.
   Survey-weighted linear and quantile regression models were fitted on the
   combined data with the log-transformed congener concentration as outcome
   and age, sex, and data source as covariates. Formulas are provided to
   allow calculations of age- and sex-specific mean and quantile estimates
   over ages 18-85. For instance, the geometric mean, median, 75th
   percentile, and 95th percentile of serum TEQ for men aged 50 can be
   estimated, respectively, from the formulas as 18.33, 19.02, 22.60, and
   30.37 pg g(-1) lipids among the Michigan general population, and as
   15.71, 15.89, 22.60, and 29.90 pg g(-1) lipids among US non-Hispanic
   whites. These methods and results are useful for comparing the
   congener-specific human serum dioxin concentrations in any individual to
   the general population mean, median, 75th percentile, and 95th
   percentile, and for comparing the serum dioxin concentration in any
   group of interest to the US and the Michigan general populations. (C)

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose a new registration algorithm and computing
   framework, the KEG tracker, for estimating a camera's position and
   orientation for a general class of mobile context-aware applications in
   Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC). By studying two
   classic natural marker-based registration algorithms,
   Homography-from-detection and Homography-from-tracking, and by
   overcoming their specific limitations of jitter and drift, our method
   applies two global constraints (geometric and appearance) to prevent
   tracking errors from propagating between consecutive frames. The
   proposed method is able to achieve an increase in both stability and
   accuracy, while being fast enough for real-time applications.
   Experiments on both synthesized and real-world test cases demonstrate
   that our method is superior to existing state-of-the-art registration
   algorithms. The article also explores several AEC applications of our
   method in context-aware computing and desktop-augmented reality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computational investigation of the effect of
   time-varying modulating conditions on a polymer electrolyte membrane
   fuel cell. The focus is on developing a better understanding of the fuel
   cell's water balance under transient conditions, which is critical in
   improving the fuel cell design. The study employs a macroscopic
   single-fuel cell-based, one-dimensional, isothermal model. The model
   does not rely on the non-physical assumption of the uptake curve
   equilibrium between the pore vapor and ionomer water in the catalyst
   layers. Instead, the transition between the two phases is modeled as a
   finite-rate equilibration process. The modulating conditions are
   simulated by forcing the temporal variations in fuel cell voltage. The
   results show that cell voltage modulations cause a departure in the cell
   behavior from its steady behavior, and the finite-rate equilibration
   between the catalyst vapor and liquid water can be a factor in
   determining the cell response. The cell response is also affected by the
   modulating frequency and amplitude. The peak cell response is observed
   at low frequencies. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Significant progress has been achieved in fabricating high-quality bulk
   and thin-film iron-based superconductors. In particular, artificial
   layered pnictide superlattices(1,2) offer the possibility of tailoring
   the superconducting properties and understanding the mechanism of the
   superconductivity itself. For high-field applications, large critical
   current densities (J(c)) and irreversibility fields (H-irr) are
   indispensable along all crystal directions. On the other hand, the
   development of superconducting devices such as tunnel junctions requires
   multilayered heterostructures. Here we show that artificially engineered
   undoped Ba-122/Co-doped Ba-122 compositionally modulated superlattices
   produce ab-aligned nanoparticle arrays. These layer and self-assemble
   along c-axis-aligned defects(3-5), and combine to produce very large
   J(c) and H-irr enhancements over a wide angular range. We also
   demonstrate a structurally modulated SrTiO3(STO)/Co-doped Ba-122
   superlattice with sharp interfaces. Success in superlattice fabrication
   involving pnictides will aid the progress of heterostructured systems
   exhibiting new interfacial phenomena and device applications.}},

   as intact colonies from heterogeneous reprogramming cultures and from
   differentiated progeny using microfluidics. hiPSCs were isolated label
   free, enriched to 95\%-99\% purity with >80\% survival, and had normal
   transcriptional profiles, differentiation potential and karyotypes. We
   also applied this strategy to isolate hPSCs (hiPSCs and human embryonic

Abstract = {{In comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC), thermal
   modulation is an important process to enhance the detectability of a
   volatile organic compound analyte and compound separation capacity. For
   increased detectability, we explore a method to enhance the temperature
   uniformity of a microfabricated thermal modulator with an area-adjusted
   air-gap spacer. The area-adjusted spacer controls the spatial
   distribution of heat transfer to increase the temperature uniformity of
   the analyte passing through the device's channel. This enables higher
   analyte peak-amplitude enhancement (PAE) during thermal modulation,
   thereby increasing detectability of the analyte. The influence of
   varying spacer area on temperature uniformity was characterized by
   simulation, and its effect on PAE was experimentally estimated. With an
   optimized spacer design, we achieved a 25\% increase in PAE (34-42) for
   10 ppm n-octane vapor. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{8, SI}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Monazite, CePO4, is considered an important phosphate-type structure for
   the incorporation and disposal of actinides. Nanocrystalline monazite
   with particle sizes ranging from 20 nm to greater than 100 nm was
   synthesized. The displacive and ionizing effects of radiation were
   investigated, separately and simultaneously, for 1 MeV Kr2+ and 200 keV
   electron irradiations. In situ transmission electron microscopy
   observations indicated that CePO4 nanoparticles can be readily
   amorphized by 1 MeV Kr2+ irradiation. Nanostructured monazite displays
   greater critical amorphization doses and lower critical temperatures
   than that of bulk natural monazite, suggesting enhanced amorphization
   tolerance. A strong size dependence on radiation-induced amorphization
   was observed in which the smaller-sized particles (20 nm) are less
   resistant to amorphization compared with larger-sized particles (40 nm).
   The excess surface energy of nanostructured materials, as suggested by
   the larger surface area upon the reduction of particle size, may alter
   the energy difference between amorphous and crystalline phases, thus
   affecting the radiation stability. With 200 keV electron-beam
   irradiation, CePO4 previously amorphized by 1 MeV Kr2+ experienced an
   ionizing-radiation-induced recrystallization. A greater
   recrystallization rate was observed for the smaller-sized particles.
   Under simultaneous electron and displacive ion irradiations, CePO4
   displayed greater tolerance against amorphization, probably as a result
   of radiation-induced recovery of displacive damage by the ionizing
   radiation. The strong size dependence of displacive radiation-induced
   amorphization and ionizing-radiation-enhanced recrystallization
   processes for nanostructured CePO4 implies that an optimized size regime
   may exist in which nanostructured materials are more tolerant of
   radiation-induced amorphization. (c) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{Compact and low-cost sensors used in wireless sensor networks are
   vulnerable to deterioration and failure. As the number and scale of
   sensor deployments grow, the failure of sensors becomes an increasingly
   paramount issue. This paper presents a distributed, reference-free fault
   detection algorithm that is based on local pair-wise verification
   between sensors monitoring the same physical system. Specifically, a
   linear relationship is shown to exist between the outputs of a pair of
   sensors measuring the same system. Using this relationship, faulty
   sensors may be detected within subsystems of the global system.
   Moreover, faulty sensors suffering from sparse spikes in their
   measurements can be identified with spike magnitudes and times
   accurately estimated. An appealing feature of the proposed method is
   that the need for reference sensors and complete knowledge of the system

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study of temperature distribution
   and evolution in nanoshell colloidal solution and in phantom tissue
   populated with gold nanoshells under localized surface plasma resonance
   heating by an NIR laser. Gold nanoshells were synthesized in our
   laboratory and characterized using the TEM. Their optical properties
   were measured by a CARY 5000 photospectrometer and the localized surface
   plasma resonance occurs at 796 nm. Two types of temperature measurement
   systems were used: one for the gold nanoshell colloidal solution and the
   other for nanoshell-populated phantom tissue. For both cases, heating
   was initiated by an NIR laser of 808 nm. Measured data reveal that the
   temperature rises rapidly as a result of strong heating of gold
   nanoshells, which is converted from the absorbed laser energy under
   localized surface plasma resonance condition. Without nanoshell-mediated
   resonance absorption and heating, however, the temperature increase is
   practically negligible. The thermal transport mechanism in
   nanoshell-embedded tissue appears to be dominant by radiative heat
   transfer in the laser beam heating region but primarily by thermal
   conduction away from the laser beam. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Dynamic compaction (DC) has an extensive performance record on municipal
   solid waste (MSW) sites. A database of 56 test sites has been developed
   and analyzed to garner lessons on the performance of DC on MSW sites.
   Analysis of the data indicates that the depth of improvement in MSW is
   shallower than the depth of improvement in cohesionless soils with
   values of the empirical parameter, n, for MSW commonly on the order of
   0.4 +/- 0.05. DC results in a denser waste matrix that increases the
   stiffness of the waste by a factor of 2.8-24 compared with its
   unimproved state and results in reduction of waste compression upon load
   application. The achieved higher density and more stable structure of
   the MSW result in a lower rate and amount of long-term settlement.
   Limited studies indicate that DC is an effective technique to reduce
   settlements. Surface wave seismic methods represent an attractive method
   to assess the depth of improvement. Vibrations induced by DC are
   attenuated faster in MSW than in inorganic soils. DOI:

Abstract = {{In this work, we report the growth of vertically aligned bulk InGaN
   nanowires (NWs) on r-plane sapphire substrate by metal organic chemical
   vapor deposition (MOCVD). Through the optimization process of growth
   conditions, such as growth temperature and pressure, we obtained high
   density InGaN NWs consisting of one (000 (1) under bar) polar- and two
   equivalent \{1 (1) under bar 01\} semi-polar planes. We have shown the
   highest InGaN NWs wire density of 8 x 10(8) cm(-2), with an average
   diameter of 300 nm and a length of 2 mu m. From results of
   photoluminescence (PL) at 30 K and 300 K, we observed the intense and
   broad emission peak from InGaN NWs at around 595 nm, and confirmed that
   the luminescence could be tuned from 580 nm to 660 nm by controlling the
   indium flow (TMIn) rate. Our results indicate that MOCVD-grown InGaN NWs
   can be effective absorbers of the blue-green range of solar spectrum and
   may be one of the good candidates for high efficiency photovoltaic
   devices targeting at blue-green photons. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

Abstract = {{An integrated computational framework for textile polymer composites is
   introduced. A novel polymer curing model is used in connection with
   modeling the polymer curing process during manufacturing of textile
   composites. The model is based on the notion of polymer networks that
   are continuously formed in a body of changing shape due to changes in
   temperature, chemistry and external loads. Nonlinear material behavior
   is incorporated through nonlocal continuum damage mechanics that
   preserves mesh objectivity in calculations that go beyond maximum loads.
   The integrated model is applied to the curing of plain weave textile
   composites made from carbon fiber tows and Epon (TM) 4862 resin. The
   mechanical and chemical properties are measured during curing using
   concurrent Brillouin and Raman light scattering. It is shown that
   significant stresses can develop during cure. The effect of these
   stresses on the manufactured part performance, when subsequent service
   loads are applied, is evaluated and a reduction in ultimate load, in
   agreement with experimental observations, is observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need in the architecture, engineering, and
   construction industries for new programs and methods of producing
   reliable energy simulations using building information modeling (BIM)
   technology. Current methods and programs for running energy simulations
   are not very timely, are difficult to understand, and lack high
   interoperability between BIM and energy simulation software. It is
   necessary to improve on these drawbacks as design decisions are often
   made without the aid of energy modeling leading to the design and
   construction of nonoptimized buildings with respect to energy
   efficiency. The goal of this research project is to develop a new
   methodology to produce energy estimates from a BIM model expeditiously
   and to improve interoperability between the simulation engine and BIM
   software. In the proposed methodology, the extracted information from a
   BIM model is compiled into an input file and run in a popular energy
   simulation program on an hourly basis for a desired period. The case
   applied in this paper showed that the application of this methodology
   can be used to quickly provide energy simulations from BIM models. With
   the aid of an easy-to-run and easily understood energy simulation
   methodology, designers will be able to make more energy conscious
   decisions during the design phase and as changes in design requirements
   arise. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000215. (C) 2013 American

   (CAD) system is to express numeric construction schedule data into a
   visual format. While existing 4D CAD systems are appropriate for
   building projects composed of vertical schedule progress and
   manufactured elements, the basic functions of those systems have
   limitations when directly applied to a civil engineering project, such
   as highway and railway facilities. Such projects include horizontal
   works, and their activities are carried out according to the elements of
   natural topography. This study attempts to develop a 4D CAD engine that
   supports analysis of the 4D objects for horizontal elements including a
   visual simulation of a cutting and filling status of an earthwork
   section in civil engineering projects. The system uses integrated
   information management techniques employing work breakdown structure for
   simulating 4D objects for each level. The developed engine includes new
   functions for visualizing work schedule and activity progress in highway
   and railway project with horizontal earthwork. Finally, to improve the
   practical applicability of a 4D CAD system, a new method for visualizing
   risk analysis data is suggested for future studies. DOI:

Abstract = {{A typical unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) mission can be composed of
   various tasks and several alternative paths. Small UGVs are typically
   teleoperated and rely on electric rechargeable batteries for their
   operations. Since each battery has limited energy storage capacity, it
   is essential to predict the expected mission energy requirement during
   the mission execution and update this prediction adaptively via
   real-time performance measurements (e.g., vehicle power consumption and
   velocity). We propose and compare two methods in this paper. One is
   based on recursive least-squares estimation built upon a UGV
   longitudinal dynamics model. The other is based on Bayesian estimation
   when prior knowledge (e.g., road average grade and operator driving
   style) is available. The proposed Bayesian prediction can effectively
   combine prior knowledge with real-time performance measurements for
   adaptively updating the prediction of the mission energy requirement.
   Our experimental and simulation studies show that the Bayesian approach
   can yield more accurate predictions even with moderately imprecise prior
   knowledge. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Direct metal deposition (DMD) technology is a laser-aided rapid
   prototyping method that can be used to fabricate near net shape
   components from their CAD files. In the present study, a series of Al-Si
   samples have been deposited by DMD in order to optimize the laser
   deposition parameters to produce high quality deposit with minimum
   porosity and maximum deposition rate. This paper presents the
   microstructural evolution of the as-deposited Al 4047 sample produced
   with optimized process parameters. Optical, scanning, and transmission
   electron microscopes have been employed to characterize the
   microstructure of the deposit. The electron backscattered diffraction
   method was used to investigate the grain size distribution, grain
   boundary misorientation, and texture of the deposits. Metallographic
   investigation revealed that the microstructural morphology strongly
   varies with the location of the deposit. The layer boundaries consist of
   equiaxed Si particles distributed in the Al matrix. However, a
   systematic transition from columnar Al dendrites to equiaxed dendrites
   has been observed in each layer. The observed variation of the
   microstructure was correlated with the thermal history and local cooling
   rate of the melt pool.}},

Abstract = {{A major translational challenge in the fields of therapeutic
   angiogenesis and tissue engineering is the ability to form functional
   networks of blood vessels. Cell-based strategies to promote
   neovascularization have been widely explored, and have led to the
   consensus that co-delivery of endothelial cells (ECs) (or their
   progenitors) with some sort of a supporting stromal cell type is the
   most effective approach. However, the choice of stromal cells has varied
   widely across studies, and their impact on the functional qualities of
   the capillaries produced has not been examined. In this study, we
   injected human umbilical vein ECs alone or with normal human lung
   fibroblasts (NHLFs), human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells
   (BMSCs), or human adipose-derived stem cells (AdSCs) in a fibrin matrix
   into subcutaneous pockets in SCID mice. All conditions yielded new
   human-derived vessels that inosculated with mouse vasculature and
   perfused the implant, but there were significant functional differences
   in the capillary networks, depending heavily on the identity of the
   co-delivered stromal cells. EC-alone and EC-NHLF implants yielded
   immature capillary beds characterized by high levels of erythrocyte
   pooling in the surrounding matrix. EC-BMSC and EC-AdSC implants produced
   more mature capillaries characterized by less extravascular leakage and
   the expression of mature pericyte markers. Injection of a fluorescent
   tracer into the circulation also showed that EC-BMSC and EC-AdSC
   implants formed vasculature with more tightly regulated permeability.
   These results suggest that the identity of the stromal cells is key to
   controlling the functional properties of engineered capillary networks.}},

Title = {{Crack velocity-dependent dynamic tensile behavior of concrete}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{63-70}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Experiments have consistently shown that the tensile strength of
   concrete increases with increasing strain rate. The reasons for this
   phenomenon are not yet well understood and several hypotheses have been
   proposed in the past to explain it. This study offers additional insight
   through the application of dynamic fracture mechanics. The relationship
   between crack velocity and strain rate of concrete is first investigated
   using a cohesive zone model and fitted to available experimental data.
   The obtained relationship is then implemented into two different
   versions of crack-speed dependent dynamic fracture models. Both models
   show that computed strength versus strain rate responses compare
   favorably to well-established test data, suggesting that strain rate
   sensitivity is strongly associated with the characteristics of dynamic
   crack growth and inertial effects at the boundaries of the crack. A
   constitutive modeling scheme that incorporates the obtained dynamic
   fracture models into a meso-mechanical model is also proposed to predict
   stress-strain behavior of concrete under dynamic tensile loading.
   Comparisons between model predictions and published experimental data
   are provided to show the accuracy of the proposed framework. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{This study examines the use of high-resolution ultrasound to monitor
   changes in the morphology and nonlinear elastic properties of engineered
   oral mucosal tissues under normal and thermally stressed culture
   conditions. Nonlinear elastic properties were determined by first
   developing strain maps from acoustic ultrasound, followed by fitting of
   nonlinear stress-strain data to a 1-term Ogden model. Testing examined a
   clinically developed ex vivo produced oral mucosa equivalent (EVPOME).
   As seeded cells proliferate on an EVPOME surface, they produce a
   keratinized protective upper layer that fills in and smoothens out
   surface irregularities. These transformations can also alter the
   nonlinear stress/strain parameters as EVPOME cells differentiate. This
   EVPOME behavior is similar to those of natural oral mucosal tissues and
   in contrast to an unseeded scaffold. If ultrasonic monitoring could be
   developed, then tissue cultivation could be adjusted in-process to
   account for biological variations in their development of the stratified
   cellular layer. In addition to ultrasonic testing, an inhouse-built
   compression system capable of accurate measurements on small (similar to
   1.0-1.5 cm(2)) tissue samples is presented. Results showed a near
   2.5-fold difference in the stiffness properties between the unstressed
   EVPOME and the noncell-seeded acellular scaffold (AlloDerm (R)). There
   were also 4 x greater differences in root mean square values of the
   thickness in the unseeded AlloDerm compared to the mature unstressed
   EVPOME; this is a strong indicator for quantifying surface roughness.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by image reconstruction, sparse representation based
   classification (SRC) has been shown to be an effective method for
   applications like face recognition. In this paper, we propose a
   locality-sensitive dictionary learning algorithm for SRC, in which the
   designed dictionary is able to preserve local data structure, resulting
   in improved image classification. During the dictionary update and
   sparse coding stages in the proposed algorithm, we provide closed-form
   solutions and enforce the data locality constraint throughout the
   learning process. In contrast to previous dictionary learning approaches
   utilizing sparse representation techniques, which did not (or only
   partially) take data locality into consideration, our algorithm is able
   to produce a more representative dictionary and thus achieves better
   performance. We conduct experiments on databases designed for face and
   handwritten digit recognition. For such reconstruction-based
   classification problems, we will confirm that our proposed method
   results in better or comparable performance as state-of-the-art SRC
   methods do, while less training time for dictionary learning can be

Abstract = {{Elastocapillary self-assembly is emerging as a versatile technique to
   manufacture three-dimensional (3D) microstructures and complex surface
   textures from arrangements of micro- and nanoscale filaments.
   Understanding the mechanics of capillary self-assembly is essential to
   engineering of properties such as shape-directed actuation, anisotropic
   wetting and adhesion, and mechanical energy transfer and dissipation. We
   study elastocapillary self-assembly (herein called ``capillary
   forming{''}) of carbon nanotube (CNT) microstructures, combining in situ
   optical imaging, micro-mechanical testing, and finite element modeling.
   By imaging, we identify sequential stages of liquid infiltration,
   evaporation, and solid shrinkage, whose kinetics relate to the size and
   shape of the CNT microstructure. We couple these observations with
   measurements of the orthotropic elastic moduli of CNT forests to
   understand how the dynamic of shrinkage of the vapor liquid interface is
   coupled to the compression of the forest. We compare the kinetics of
   shrinkage to the rate of evporation from liquid droplets having the same
   size and geometry. Moreover, we show that the amount of shrinkage during
   evaporation is governed by the ability of the CNTs to slip against one
   another, which can be manipulated by the deposition of thin conformal
   coatings on the CNTs by atomic layer deposition (ALD). This insight is
   confirmed by finite element modeling of pairs of CNTs as corrugated
   beams in contact and highlights the coupled role of elasticity and
   friction in Shrinkage and stability of nanoporous solids. Overall, this
   study shows that nanoscale porosity can be tailored via the filament
   density and adhesion at contact points, which is important to the
   development of lightweight multifunctional materials.}},

Abstract = {{A series of novel oligothiophene-perylene bisimide hybrid (DOTPBI)
   dendrimers up to the second generation (G0, G1, and G2) were
   investigated. Optical measurements such as nonlinear optical and time
   resolved spectroscopy, including two-photon absorption, fluorescence
   upconversion, and excited state transient absorption were carried out.
   Results of these measurements revealed the ability of these molecules to
   undergo intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
   from the dendritic oligothiophenes (DOT) to the perylene bismide (PBI)
   moiety. The delocalization length and the photoinduced electron transfer
   (PET) rate were investigated as a function of dendrimer 1 generation. A
   fast energy transfer process from the DOT dendron to the PBI core was
   observed. For the case of the G2 dendrimer, with relatively large
   thiophene dendrons attached to the bay area of the perylene bisimide,
   the PBI core is highly twisted and its ability to self-assemble into
   pi-pi stacked aggregates is destroyed. As a result, among the three
   generations studied, G1, which has the best two-photon cross section and
   the most efficient energy transfer, is the best light harvesting
   material.}},

Abstract = {{Single-molecule super-resolution microscopy is an emerging technique for
   nanometer-scale fluorescence imaging, but in vitro single-molecule
   imaging protocols typically require a constant supply of reagents, and
   such transport is restricted in constrained geometries. In this article,
   we develop single-molecule micelle-assisted blink (MAB) microcopy to
   enable subdiffraction-limit imaging of nanochannels with better than 40
   nm accuracy. The method, based on micelles and thiol-related
   photoswitching, is used to measure nanochannels formed in
   polydimethylsiloxane through tensile cracking. These conduits are
   reversibly size-adjustable from a few nanometers up to a micrometer and
   enable filtering of small particles and linearization of DNA.
   Unfortunately, conventional techniques cannot be used to measure widths,
   characterize heterogeneities, or discover porosity in situ. We overcome
   the access barriers by using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), an ionic
   surfactant, to facilitate delivery of Cy5 dye and beta-mercaptoethanol
   reducing agent in the confined geometry. These SDS micelles and
   admicelles have the further benefit of slowing diffusion of Cy5 to
   improve localization accuracy. We use MAB microscopy to measure
   nanochannel widths, to reveal heterogeneity along channel lengths and
   between different channels in the same device, and to probe biologically
   relevant information about the nanoenvironment, such as solvent
   accessibility.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, the field of advanced nanocomposites has relied on a
   fairly limited set of building blocks; many with low reactivity and of
   limited variability. These limitations have been addressed by the
   creation of functionalized nanometer-scale aramid structures, in the
   form of nanofibers and nanosheets. These were obtained by deprotonating
   macroscale, commercial Kevlar yarns using potassium hydroxide in
   dimethyl sulfoxide to yield stable dispersions of nanometer-scale aramid
   fibers that were then hydrolyzed using phosphoric acid (PA). To
   illustrate the use of these functionally-active nanostructures as
   building blocks for nanocomposites, they were crosslinked by
   glutaraldehyde (GA), and formed into macroscopic thin films by
   vacuum-assisted filtration. It was shown that the mechanical properties
   of these PA/GA treated films can be tuned by varying the amounts of PA
   and GA used during synthesis, adjusting the relative amounts of
   hydrolysis and polymerization. These results are the first demonstration
   that aramid nanometer-scale fibers can be used to form versatile
   nanometersized building blocks that can then be crosslinked to fabricate
   a wide variety of nanostructured aramid materials with tailorable
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Developing metal-free organic phosphorescent materials is promising but
   challenging because achieving emissive triplet relaxation that
   outcompetes the vibrational loss of triplets, a key process to achieving
   phosphorescence, is difficult without heavy metal atoms. While recent
   studies reveal that bright room temperature phosphorescence can be
   realized in purely organic crystalline materials through directed
   halogen bonding, these organic phosphors still have limitations to
   practical applications due to the stringent requirement of high quality
   crystal formation. Here we report bright room temperature
   phosphorescence by embedding a purely organic phosphor into an amorphous
   glassy polymer matrix. Our study implies that the reduced beta
   (beta)-relaxation of isotactic PMMA most efficiently suppresses
   vibrational triplet decay and allows the embedded organic phosphors to
   achieve a bright 7.5\% phosphorescence quantum yield. We also
   demonstrate a microfluidic device integrated with a novel temperature
   sensor based on the metal-free purely organic phosphors in the
   temperature-sensitive polymer matrix. This unique system has many
   advantages: (i) simple device structures without feeding additional
   temperature sensing agents, (ii) bright phosphorescence emission, (iii)
   a reversible thermal response, and (iv) tunable temperature sensing
   ranges by using different polymers.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate polarized blue single photon emission up to 200K from an
   In0.2Ga0.8N quantum dot in a single Al0.1Ga0.9N nanowire. The
   InGaN/AlGaN dot-in-nanowire heterostructure was grown on (111) silicon
   by plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Nanowires dispersed on a
   silicon substrate show sharp exciton and biexciton transitions in the
   micro-photoluminescence spectra. Second-order correlation measurements
   performed under pulsed excitation at the biexciton wavelength confirm
   single photon emission, with a g((2))(0) of 0.43 at 200 K. The emitted
   photons have a short radiative lifetime of 0.7 ns and are linearly
   polarized along the c-axis of the nanowire with a degree of polarization
   of 78\%. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC

Abstract = {{Dead-Ended Anode (DEA) operation of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells
   (PEMFCs) yields a system with lower complexity and the potential to
   reduce system cost as fewer external components are required.
   Optimization of the purge interval and cycle duration, for a given
   operating power, can increase the fuel cell efficiency which depends on
   three interrelated objectives, namely, the hydrogen loss during the
   purge, the average voltage output between the purges, and the voltage
   decrease due to the carbon corrosion caused by hydrogen starvation over
   the lifetime of the DEA operation.
   In advancing past results, this paper shows how the purge cycle can be
   optimized for better efficiency in DEA operation by considering the
   impact of carbon corrosion. For this optimization, a model capturing the
   liquid water and nitrogen accumulation in the anode is needed to
   accurately describe the evolution of corrosion rate and the amount of
   hydrogen wasted during the purge. The optimization process is first
   defining a target range of purge intervals based on the physical
   constraints of the actuator and the model-based prediction of the
   species concentration distributions. The search of optima is performed
   then by scanning the target domain to quantify the trade-off between
   wasted hydrogen and reducing the corrosion rate over a long time
   horizon. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Title = {{A continuum model for the static pull-in behavior of graphene nanoribbon
   electrostatic actuators with interlayer shear and surface energy effects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{Based on multi-beam shear model theory, a continuum mechanics model is
   developed to investigate the pull-in instability of wedged/curved
   multilayer graphene nanoribbon (MLGNR) cantilever nanobeams subjected to
   electrostatic and Casimir forces. The first-order fringing-field
   correction, the interlayer shear between neighboring graphene
   nanoribbons (GNRs), surface elasticity, and residual surface tension are
   incorporated into the analytical model. An explicit closed-form
   analytical solution to the governing fourth-order nonlinear differential
   equation of variable coefficients is introduced for the static pull-in
   behavior of electrostatic nanoactuators using a Fredholm integral
   equation of the first kind. A comparison study for a {[}001] silver
   electrostatic nanoactuator indicates that the proposed analytical
   closed-form solution yields an improved accuracy over other analytical
   and numerical methods existing in literature. The results indicate that
   the interfacial slip between GNRs and the surface material parameters
   play a significant role in static pull-in behavior of MLGNR
   electrostatic nanoactuators. From the experimental data and atomistic
   simulations available in the literature, the value of interlayer shear
   modulus at the graphene/graphene interface is estimated to be in the
   order of magnitude of 10(-1) GPa. The continuum model proposed in this
   study will be helpful for characterizing the mechanical properties of
   GNRs and the design of graphene-based nanoelectromechanical system
   devices. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Visualizing the Attack of RNase Enzymes on Dendriplexes and Naked RNA
   Using Atomic Force Microscopy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{Cationic polymers such as poly(amidoamine), PAMAM, dendrimers have been
   used to electrostatically complex siRNA molecules forming dendriplexes
   for enhancing the cytoplasmic delivery of the encapsulated cargo.
   However, excess PAMAM dendrimers is typically used to protect the loaded
   siRNA against enzymatic attack, which results in systemic toxicity that
   hinders the in vivo use of these particles. In this paper, we evaluate
   the ability of G4 (flexible) and G5 (rigid) dendrimers to complex model
   siRNA molecules at low +/- ratio of 2/1 upon incubation for 20 minutes
   and 24 hours. We examine the ability of the formed G4 and G5
   dendriplexes to shield the loaded siRNA molecules and protect them from
   degradation by RNase V1 enzymes using atomic force microscopy (AFM).
   Results show that G4 and G5 dendrimers form similar hexagonal complexes
   upon incubation with siRNA molecules for 20 minutes with average full
   width of 43 +/- 19.3 nm and 62 +/- 8.3 at half the maximum height,
   respectively. AFM images show that these G4 and G5 dendriplexes were
   attacked by RNase V1 enzyme leading to degradation of the exposed RNA
   molecules that increased with the increase in incubation time. In
   comparison, incubating G4 and G5 dendrimers with siRNA for 24 hours led
   to the formation of large particles with average full width of 263 +/-
   60 nm and 48.3 +/- 2.5 nm at half the maximum height, respectively. Both
   G4 and G5 dendriplexes had a dense central core that proved to shield
   the loaded RNA molecules from enzymatic attack for up to 60 minutes.
   These results show the feasibility of formulating G4 and G5 dendriplexes
   at a low N/P (+/-) ratio that can resist degradation by RNase enzymes,
   which reduces the risk of inducing non-specific toxicity when used in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{The stabilities of three moisture-stable MOFs containing different metal
   clusters, i.e., HKUST-1 (Cu), MIL-53(Al), and ZIF-8 (Zn), were
   investigated in dihydrogen and dissociated hydrogen (caused by doped Pt
   nanoparticles) environments. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray-excited Auger electron
   spectroscopy (XAES) results showed that all three MOFs were stable in
   dihydrogen environment. However, the structure of Pt-doped HKUST-1
   collapsed in the presence of dissociated hydrogen due to the higher
   reduction potential of Cu compared with H, and the degree of reduction
   that occurred to the divalent copper in HKUST-1 increased with
   temperature. Unlike HKUST-1, MIL-53 and ZIF-8 maintained their
   structures in both dihydrogen and dissociated hydrogen environments at
   temperatures up to 150 degrees C. Moreover, comparison of Pt-doped
   HKUST-1 samples synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and
   incipient wetness impregnation showed that the contact between the doped
   Pt particles (dissociation source) and MOFs (receptor) significantly
   affected hydrogen spillover.}},

Abstract = {{The anomalous temperature-independent behavior of the Seebeck
   coefficient and the lattice thermal conductivity of B13C2 are explained
   through polaron and phonon evolutions found using ab initio molecular
   dynamics (AIMD). Analyses of lattice dynamics show that the unique
   icosahedron structures dominate the optical phonon modes and CBC
   intericosahedral bonds dominate the local acoustic vibration. We
   identify that the temperature-induced Jahn-Teller distortion and
   electron-phonon coupling in icosahedron structures create small polarons
   (i.e., charge trapping and phonon softening). We also verify that
   large-displacement chain atoms scatter heat-conducting phonons. Using
   equilibrium and nonequilibrium AIMD methods (including entropy and
   energy analyses), we predict the Seebeck coefficient and its components
   as well as the lattice thermal conductivity, and we find good agreement
   with experiments. Softened and localized phonons make a significant
   vibrational contribution to the Seebeck coefficient and allow for an
   amorphous-like lattice thermal conductivity. DOI:

Title = {{Atmospheric-pressure plasma transfer across dielectric channels and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{Atmospheric-pressure plasma transfer refers to producing an ionization
   wave (IW) in a tube or channel by impingement of a separately produced
   IW onto its outer surface. In this paper, we report on numerical and
   experimental investigations of this plasma transfer phenomenon. The two
   tubes, source and transfer, are perpendicular to each other in ambient
   air with a 4mm separation with both tubes being flushed with Ne or a
   Ne/Xe gas mixture at 1 atmosphere pressure. The primary IW is generated
   in the source tube by ns to mu s pulses of +/- 25 kV, while the transfer
   tube is electrodeless, not electrically connected to the first and at a
   floating potential. The simulations are conducted using a
   two-dimensional (2D) plasma hydrodynamics model with radiation
   transport, where the three-dimensional tubes in the experiments are
   represented by 2D channels. Simulations and experiments show that the
   primary IW propagates across the inter-tube gap and upon impingement
   induces two secondary IWs propagating in opposite directions in the
   transfer tube. Depending on the polarity of the primary IW in the source
   tube, the secondary IW in the transfer tube can have polarities either
   the same or opposite to that of the primary IW. The speed and strength
   of both the primary and secondary IWs depend on the rate of rise of the
   voltage pulse in the source tube. The modelling results were found to
   agree well with the behaviour of plasma transfer observed using
   nanosecond intensified charge-coupled device imaging.}},

Abstract = {{In 2011, Lake Erie experienced the largest harmful algal bloom in its
   recorded history, with a peak intensity over three times greater than
   any previously observed bloom. Here we show that long-term trends in
   agricultural practices are consistent with increasing phosphorus loading
   to the western basin of the lake, and that these trends, coupled with
   meteorological conditions in spring 2011, produced record-breaking
   nutrient loads. An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to
   abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and
   quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the
   top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the
   system. We further find that all of these factors are consistent with
   expected future conditions. If a scientifically guided management plan
   to mitigate these impacts is not implemented, we can therefore expect
   this bloom to be a harbinger of future blooms in Lake Erie.}},

Abstract = {{Microfabricated fluidic systems have emerged as a powerful approach for
   chemical analysis. Relatively unexplored is the use of microfabrication
   to create sampling probes. We have developed a sampling probe
   microfabricated in Si by bulk micromachining and lithography. The probe
   is 70 mu m wide by 85 mu m thick by 11 mm long and incorporates two
   buried channels that are 20 mu m in diameter. The tip of the probe has
   two 20 mu m holes where fluid is ejected or collected for sampling.
   Utility of the probe was demonstrated by sampling from the brain of live
   rats. For sampling, artificial cerebral spinal fluid was infused in
   through one channel at SO nL/min while sample was withdrawn at the same
   flow rate from the other channel. Analysis of resulting fractions
   collected every 20 min from the striatum of rats by liquid
   chromatography with mass spectrometry demonstrated reliable detection of
   17 neurotransmitters and metabolites. The small probe dimensions suggest
   it is less perturbing to tissue and can be used to sample smaller brain
   nuclei than larger sampling devices, such as microdialysis probes. This
   sampling probe may have other applications such as sampling from cells
   in culture. The use of microfabrication may also enable incorporation of
   electrodes for electrochemical or electrophysiological recording and
   other channels that enable more complex sample preparation on the
   device.}},

Abstract = {{We report a method to synthesize and image Janus spheroid and
   ``kayak{''} shaped patchy particles that combine both shape and
   interaction anisotropy. These particles are fabricated by sequentially
   combining evaporative deposition of chrome and gold with the uniaxial
   deformation of the colloidal particles into spheroids. We introduce
   combined reflection and fluorescence confocal microscopy to image each
   component of the patchy particle. Image analysis algorithms that resolve
   patch orientation from these image volumes are described and used to
   characterize self-assembly behavior. Assemblies of the Janus spheroid
   and kayak particles produced at different salt concentrations
   demonstrate the functional nature of the patch-to-patch interactions
   between the particles. Selective gold-to-gold patch bonding is observed
   at intermediate salt concentrations, while higher salt concentrations
   yield gel-like structures with nonselective patch-to-patch bonding. At
   intermediate salt concentrations, differences in the orientational order
   of the assemblies indicate that both the preferential gold-to-gold patch
   bonding and the particles' shape anisotropy influence the self-assembled
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and optimizing water and thermal management in the
   catalyst layer of proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells is crucial for
   performance and durability improvements. This is especially the case at
   low temperatures, where liquid water and even ice may exist. In this
   article, the durability of a traditional Pt/C dispersed and a
   nanostructure thin film (NSTF) membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) are
   examined under wet/dry and freeze/thaw cycles using both in situ and ex
   situ experiments. Multiple isothermal cold starts result in a
   performance degradation for the dispersed MEA, while no such a
   degradation is found in the NSTF. The results are consistent with
   stand-alone MEA tests, wherein the dispersed catalyst layer results in
   an exponential increase in the number and size of cracks until it
   delaminates from the membrane due to the impact of the freeze/thaw
   process within the catalyst-layer pores. The NSTF catalyst layer shows
   minimal crack generation without delamination since the ice forms on top
   of the layer. The results are useful for understanding degradation due
   to phase-change containing cycles. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   interface-capturing schemes represent such flows well at early times,
   the excessive numerical dissipation thereby introduced and the resulting
   computational cost prevent the resolution of small-scale features.
   Furthermore, unless special care is taken, shock-capturing schemes
   generate spurious pressure oscillations at material interfaces where the
   specific heats ratio varies. To remedy these problems, a
   solution-adaptive high-order central/shock-capturing finite difference
   scheme is presented for efficient computations of compressible
   multi-material flows, including turbulence. A new discontinuity sensor
   discriminates between smooth and discontinuous regions. The appropriate
   split form of ( energy preserving) central schemes is derived for flows
   of smoothly varying specific heats ratio, such that spurious pressure
   oscillations are prevented. High-order accurate weighted essentially
   non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes are applied only at discontinuities; the
   standard approach is followed for shocks and contacts, but material
   discontinuities are treated by interpolating the primitive variables.
   The hybrid nature of the method allows for efficient and accurate
   computations of shocks and broadband motions, and is shown to prevent
   pressure oscillations for varying specific heats ratios. The method is
   assessed through one-dimensional problems with shocks, sharp interfaces
   and smooth distributions of specific heats ratio, and the
   two-dimensional single-mode inviscid and viscous Richtmyer-Meshkov
   instability with re-shock. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The bonding and morphology of Pd clusters deposited on the LaO- and
   FeO2-terminated LaFeO3 (001) surface were studied using periodic density
   functional methods together with scanning transmission electron
   microscopy. We show that Pd tends to aggregate to three-dimensional (3D)
   clusters on both terminations since the Pd-Pd cohesive energy is larger
   than the Pd-LaFeO3 adhesive energy. However, from the kinetic point of
   view, Pd migration on the LaO termination is facile, while stronger
   interactions between Pd and the FeO2 termination significantly hinder
   the migration of Pd. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations
   demonstrate that Pd would agglomerate into 3D metallic and PdOx
   particles on the LaO and FeO2 terminations, respectively, and hint at
   the possibility of partial penetration of the PdOx particles into the
   surface, as observed experimentally. (C) 2013 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Bimetallic Au-Cu/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalysts prepared by

   (SRM) in the range of 200-500 degrees C. Many effective parameters-Au/Cu
   atomic ratio, gas pretreatment, total metal loading, and calcination
   temperature-were investigated and correlated with catalyst properties.
   At the Au/Cu ratio of 1/3, the homogeneous Au-Cu alloy was found to be
   active for SRM, while an inhomogeneous or partially developed alloy
   formation was found after applying H-2 and O-2 pretreatments. There were
   no significant differences in catalytic activity with different total
   loadings and calcination temperatures; however, the 7 wt\% Au-Cu
   catalyst calcined at 300 degrees C exhibited complete methanol
   conversion, 82\% H-2 selectivity, and 1\% CO selectivity at a low
   temperature of 300 degrees C. In regards to stability, the bimetallic

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Abstract = {{We examine the role of N environment on persistent photoconductivity
   (PPC) in GaAs1-xNx films. For x > 0.006, significant PPC is observed at
   cryogenic temperatures, with the PPC magnitude increasing with
   increasing x due to an increase in the density of N-induced levels.
   Interestingly, rapid thermal annealing suppresses the PPC magnitude and
   reduces the N interstitial fraction; thus, the N-induced level is likely
   associated with N interstitials. PPC is attributed to the
   photogeneration of carriers from N-induced levels to the conduction-band
   edge, leading to a modified N molecular bond configuration. With the
   addition of thermal energy, the ground state configuration is restored;
   the N-induced level is then able to accept carriers and the conductivity
   decays to its preillumination value. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.87.155303}},

Abstract = {{We present a unified model of compound semiconductor growth based on
   kinetic Monte Carlo simulations in tandem with experimental results that
   can describe and predict the mechanisms for the formation of various
   types of nanostructures observed during droplet epitaxy. The crucial
   features of the model include the explicit and independent
   representation of atoms with different species and the ability to treat
   solid and liquid phases independently. Using this model, we examine
   nanostructural evolution in droplet epitaxy. The model faithfully
   captures several of the experimentally observed structures, including
   compact islands and nanorings. Moreover, simulations show the presence
   of Ga/GaAs core-shell structures that we validate experimentally. A
   fully analytical model of droplet epitaxy that explains the relationship
   between growth conditions and the resulting nanostructures is presented,
   yielding key insight into the mechanisms of droplet epitaxy. DOI:

Pages = {{1517-1528}},

Abstract = {{Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments responsible for cell morphology
   and intracellular organization. Their dynamical and mechanical
   properties are regulated through the nucleotide state of the tubulin
   dimers and the binding of drugs and/or microtubule-associated proteins.
   Interestingly, microtubule-stabilizing factors have differential effects
   on microtubule mechanics, but whether stabilizers have cumulative
   effects on mechanics or whether one effect dominates another is not
   clear. This is especially important for the chemotherapeutic drug Taxol,
   an important anticancer agent and the only known stabilizer that reduces
   the rigidity of microtubules. First, we ask whether Taxol will combine
   additively with another stabilizer or whether one stabilizer will
   dominate another. We call microtubules in the presence of Taxol and
   another stabilizer, doubly stabilized. Second, since Taxol is often
   added to a number of cell types for therapeutic purposes, it is
   important from a biomedical perspective to understand how Taxol added to
   these systems affects the mechanical properties in treated cells. To
   address these questions, we use the method of freely fluctuating
   filaments with our recently developed analysis technique of
   bootstrapping to determine the distribution of persistence lengths of a
   large population of microtubules treated with different stabilizers,
   including Taxol, guanosine-5' {[}(alpha, beta)-methyleno] triphosphate,
   guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), tau, and MAP4. We find that
   combinations of these stabilizers have novel effects on the mechanical
   properties of microtubules.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury emissions in China have increased by 164\% during 1992-2007.
   While major mercury producers were among energy combustion and
   nonferrous metal sectors, little is known for the socioeconomic factors
   driving the growth of emissions. In this paper we examine the underlying
   drivers and their contributions to the change of mercury emissions.
   Results show that changes in per capita GDP and GDP composition led to
   increased emissions which offset the reduction of emissions made
   possible by technology-induced decrease of mercury emissions intensity
   and changes in final demand mix. In particular, changes in final demand
   mix caused decreasing mercury emissions from 1992 to 2002 and increasing
   emissions from 2002 to 2007. Formation of fixed capital was the dominant
   driver behind the increase of mercury emissions, followed by the
   increasing urban population and net exports. This systems-based
   examination of socioeconomic drivers for China's mercury emission
   increase is critical for emission control by guiding policy-making and
   targets of technology development.}},

Abstract = {{Phototrophic microorganisms have significant potential as bioenergy
   feedstocks, but the sustainability of large-scale cultivation will
   require the use of wastewater as a renewable resource. A key barrier to
   this advancement is a lack of bioprocess understanding that would enable
   the design and implementation of efficient and resilient mixed
   community, naturally lit cultivation systems. In this study, a lumped
   pathway metabolic model (denoted the phototrophic process model or PPM)
   was developed for mixed phototrophic communities subjected to day/night
   cycling. State variables included functional biomass (X-CPO), stored
   carbohydrates (X-CH), stored lipids (X-LI), nitrate (S-NO), phosphate
   (S-P), and others. PPM metabolic reactions and stoichiometry were based
   on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, but experiments for model calibration and
   validation were performed in flat panel photobioreactors (PBRs)
   originally inoculated with biomass from a phototrophic system at a
   wastewater treatment plant. PBRs were operated continuously as
   cyclostats to poise cells for intrinsic kinetic parameter estimation in
   batch studies, which included nutrient-available conditions in light and
   dark as well as nitrogen-starved and phosphorus-starved conditions in
   light. The model was calibrated and validated and was shown to be a
   reasonable predictor of growth, lipid and carbohydrate storage, and
   lipid and carbohydrate mobilization by a mixed microbial community.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed for the spreading of a
   nanosized water droplet on a solid substrate subject to a parallel
   electric field. A combined electrostatic and Lennard-Jones potential is
   employed to represent the intermolecular interactions. Results show that
   in response to the applied field, polar water molecules realign
   themselves and this microscopic reorientation of molecular dipoles
   combines with the intermolecular forces to produce a macroscopic
   deformation of a free spherical water droplet into an ellipsoid. The
   applied field has a strong effect on the spreading of the water droplet
   on a solid substrate. For a weaker parallel field, the droplet spreading
   is asymmetric with the leading contact angle being greater than the
   trailing contact angle. With an increase in field strength, this
   asymmetry continues to increase, culminates, and then decreases until it
   disappears. The symmetric spreading remains with a further increase in
   the field strength until the saturation point is reached. This
   transition from the asymmetric to symmetric spreading is a manifestation
   of the interaction of the electric field with polar water molecules and
   the intermolecular forces within the droplet and between the water and
   solid; the interaction also leads to a change in hydrogen bonds along
   the droplet surface. The dynamics of the droplet spreading is entailed
   by the electrically induced motion of molecules along the liquid surface
   toward the solid substrate and is controlled by a competing mechanism
   among the electric, water-water, and water-solid intermolecular forces.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing of lithium-ion battery packs for electric or hybrid
   electric vehicles requires a significant amount of joining, such as
   welding, to meet the desired power and capacity needs. However,
   conventional fusion welding processes, such as resistance spot welding
   and laser welding, face difficulties in joining multiple sheets of
   highly conductive, dissimilar materials to create large weld areas.
   Ultrasonic metal welding overcomes these difficulties by using its
   inherent advantages derived from its solid-state process
   characteristics. Although ultrasonic metal welding is well-qualified for
   battery manufacturing, there is a lack of scientific quality guidelines
   for implementing ultrasonic welding in volume production. In order to
   establish such quality guidelines, this paper first identifies a number
   of critical weld attributes that determine the quality of welds by
   experimentally characterizing the weld formation over time using
   copper-to-copper welding as an example. Samples of different weld
   quality were cross-sectioned and characterized with optical microscopy,
   scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and hardness measurements in order
   to identify the relationship between physical weld attributes and weld
   performance. A novel microstructural classification method for the weld
   region of an ultrasonic metal weld is introduced to complete the weld
   quality characterization. The methodology provided in this paper links
   process parameters to weld performance through physical weld attributes.}},

   formation, average specific cutting energy, surface roughness, and tool

Title = {{Ensemble Noise-Reconstructed Empirical Mode Decomposition for Mechanical
   Fault Detection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Various faults inevitably occur in mechanical systems and may result in
   unexpected failures. Hence, fault detection is critical to reduce
   unscheduled downtime and costly breakdowns. Empirical mode decomposition
   (EMD) is an adaptive time-frequency domain signal processing method,
   potentially suitable for nonstationary and/or nonlinear processes.
   However, the EMD method suffers from several problems such as mode
   mixing, defined as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with incorrect
   scales. In this paper, an ensemble noise-reconstructed EMD method is
   proposed to ameliorate the mode mixing problem and denoise IMFs for
   enhancing fault signatures. The proposed method defines the IMF
   components as an ensemble mean of EMD trials, where each trial is
   obtained by sifting signals that have been reconstructed using the
   estimated noise present in the measured signal. Unlike traditional
   denoising methods, the noise inherent in the input data is reconstructed
   and used to reduce the background noise. Furthermore, the reconstructed
   noise helps to project different scales of the signal onto their
   corresponding IMFs, instrumental in alleviating the mode mixing problem.
   Two critical issues concerned in the method, i.e., the noise estimation
   strategy and the number of EMD trials required for denoising are
   discussed. Furthermore, a comprehensive noise-assisted EMD method is
   proposed, which includes the proposed method and ensemble EMD (EEMD).
   Numerical simulations and experimental case studies on accelerometer
   data collected from an industrial shaving process are used to
   demonstrate and validate the proposed method. Results show that the
   proposed method can both detect impending faults and isolate multiple
   faults. Hence, the proposed method can act as a promising tool for
   mechanical fault detection.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a multiscale, iterative algorithm for reconstructing video
   signals from streaming compressive measurements. Our algorithm is based
   on the observation that, at the imaging sensor, many videos should have
   limited temporal bandwidth due to the spatial lowpass filtering that is
   inherent in typical imaging systems. Under modest assumptions about the
   motion of objects in the scene, this spatial filtering prevents the
   temporal complexity of the video from being arbitrarily high. Thus, even
   though streaming measurement systems may measure a video thousands of
   times per second, we propose an algorithm that only involves
   reconstructing a much lower rate stream of ``anchor frames.{''} Our
   analysis of the temporal complexity of videos reveals an interesting
   tradeoff between the spatial resolution of the camera, the speed of any
   moving objects, and the temporal bandwidth of the video. We leverage
   this tradeoff in proposing a multiscale reconstruction algorithm that
   alternates between video reconstruction and motion estimation as it
   produces finer resolution estimates of the video. (c) 2013 SPIE and

Abstract = {{The first Polaris system was built in September 2010 and has gone
   through significant testing at multiple DOD and DOE facilities as well
   as at the University of Michigan. It has been biased almost continuously
   for the 18 months of its current lifespan without any replacement of its
   detectors. The second Polaris system was built in June 2011 and has also
   been almost continuously biased during its lifespan. The continuous
   operation of both devices has provided the best opportunity to study the
   long-term stability of pixelated CdZnTe detectors. Spectroscopic
   performance has been monitored throughout each system's lifespan to
   study their performance over time and the impact on long term operation
   of these devices. It is shown that the charge transport properties and
   spectroscopic performance of these CdZnTe detectors are stable over time
   and devoid of fabrication or assembly issues. It is expected that future
   detectors will exhibit excellent stability.}},

Abstract = {{TlBr detectors have been investigated as room-temperature or close to

   The three-dimensional position-sensitive single-polarity charge sensing
   technique, successfully used on CdZnTe gamma-ray imaging spectrometers,
   has been applied to 5-mm thick TlBr detectors and has resulted in energy
   resolutions as good as 0.73\% FWHM and 0.97\% FWHM at 662 keV on the
   best anode pixel and from all nine pixelated anodes respectively. The
   application of the three-dimensional position-sensing readout technology
   has significantly improved the spectroscopic performance of TlBr
   detectors, and has also enabled the study of transient behavior
   immediately following the application of cathode bias as a function of
   three-dimensional location within the TlBr detector material. This work
   presents the latest spectroscopic performance and characteristic initial
   transient behavior observed at -20 degrees C on a number of 5-mm thick
   TlBr detectors manufactured by Radiation Monitoring Devices.
   Characterizing the initial transient behavior observed in TlBr detectors

Abstract = {{To address the limitations of existing silicon solid-state
   photomultipliers (SSPMs), we are developing new photodetector elements
   in Al0.8Ga0.2As. With 80\% aluminum concentration in the GaAs compound,
   the material effectively becomes a wide band-gap semiconductor with a
   band-gap energy of similar to 2.1 eV. The wide band-gap characteristic
   and the relative maturity of GaAs material processing makes Al0.8Ga0.2As
   an excellent material for developing improved SSPMs with lower dark
   current. Materials with larger band gaps have a lower limit in the
   associated thermally generated dark current.
   With a proper device structure, the AlGaAs SSPM is expected to provide a
   smaller dark current with high detection efficiency within the blue to
   UV spectral region, which is ideal for state-of-the-art scintillation
   materials, such as LaBr3, CeBr3, and CLYC that emit in the UV region.
   Utilizing commercially grown AlGaAs epitaxial wafers as the starting
   material, prototype photodiode elements have been designed and
   fabricated. The photodiodes, which have a mesa structure, exhibit a
   20-30-V reverse bias breakdown. This work presents the fabrication and
   characterization of prototype avalanche photodiodes. Geiger pulses
   induced by both thermal electrons and photons are also presented, and
   the photon detection efficiency at low excess bias is estimated.}},

Abstract = {{In pixelated 3-D position sensitive CdZnTe detectors, the Compton
   imaging performance highly depends on the accuracy of the reconstructed
   3-D interaction positions. The lateral position resolution is
   traditionally limited by the anode pixel pitch. The use of transient
   signals from the pixels that do not collect charge can give a more
   precise lateral interaction position estimate. Material defects and
   electric field nonuniformity are present in many large-volume CdZnTe
   crystals. These detector nonuniformities can severely degrade the
   accuracy of the sub-pixel position algorithm. It is observed that the
   rise time of the collecting anode signal tends to be longer for the
   pixels with nonuniform electron drift velocities. This is likely due to
   diffusion or trapping and detrapping of the electron cloud as it passes
   through a region with very low drift velocity. In a nonuniform detector,
   the sub-pixel position distribution was significantly improved by
   removing the signals with rise time greater than 500 ns. It is shown
   that rise time is a good indicator of material nonuniformity and imaging
   performance. When only events with appropriate rise time of anode
   signals are used, even poor detector material can yield excellent
   sub-pixel position information, improving the gamma-ray imaging
   performance. The sub-pixel position and C/A ratio were calculated based
   on the digitized preamplifier pulse waveforms from the collecting and
   non-collecting anode pixels.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing inspiration from nature, this paper introduces and compares two

   position control, enable passive adaption to the environment, and allow
   for the exploitation of natural dynamic motions. We report in detail on
   the design and control of both prototypes and elaborate specifically on
   the problem of precise foot placement during flight without the
   sacrifice of efficient energy storage during stance. This is achieved
   through an integrated design and control approach that incorporates
   series elastic actuation, series damping actuation, and active damping
   through torque control. The two legs are employed in efficient
   hopping/running motions for which they achieve performance similar to
   humans or animals. This paper is concluded by a comparison of the
   various design choices with respect to performance and applicability, as
   well as an outlook on the usage of these legs in a fully actuated

Abstract = {{Background-Ablation of high-frequency sources in patients with atrial
   fibrillation (AF) is an effective therapy to restore sinus rhythm.
   However, this strategy may be ineffective in patients without a
   significant dominant frequency (DF) gradient. The aim of this study was
   to investigate whether sites with high-frequency activity in human AF
   can be identified noninvasively, which should help intervention planning
   and therapy.
   Methods and Results-In 14 patients with a history of AF, 67-lead body
   surface recordings were simultaneously registered with 15 endocardial
   electrograms from both atria including the highest DF site, which was
   predetermined by atrial-wide real-time frequency electroanatomical
   mapping. Power spectra of surface leads and the body surface location of
   the highest DF site were compared with intracardiac information. Highest
   DFs found on specific sites of the torso showed a significant
   correlation with DFs found in the nearest atrium (=0.96 for right atrium
   and =0.92 for left atrium) and the DF gradient between them (=0.93). The
   spatial distribution of power on the surface showed an inverse
   relationship between the frequencies versus the power spread area,
   consistent with localized fast sources as the AF mechanism with
   fibrillatory conduction elsewhere.
   Conclusions-Spectral analysis of body surface recordings during AF
   allows a noninvasive characterization of the global distribution of the
   atrial DFs and the identification of the atrium with the highest
   frequency, opening the possibility for improved noninvasive personalized
   diagnosis and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{All known integral equation techniques for simulating scattering and
   radiation from arbitrarily shaped, perfect electrically conducting
   objects suffer from one or more of the following shortcomings: (i) they
   give rise to ill-conditioned systems when the frequency is low (ii)
   and/or when the discretization density is high, (iii) their
   applicability is limited to the quasi-static regime, (iv) they require a
   search for global topological loops, (v) they suffer from numerical
   cancellations in the solution when the frequency is very low. This work
   presents an equation that does not suffer from any of the above
   drawbacks when applied to smooth and closed objects. The new formulation
   is obtained starting from a Helmholtz decomposition of two
   discretizations of the electric field integral operator obtained by
   using RWGs and dual bases respectively. The new decomposition does not
   leverage Loop and Star/Tree basis functions, but projectors that derive
   from them. Following the decomposition, the two discretizations are
   combined in a Calderon-like fashion resulting in a new overall equation
   that is shown to exhibit self-regularizing properties without suffering
   from the limitations of existing formulations. Numerical results show
   the usefulness of the proposed method both for closed and open
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{A sub-wavelength source tracking system utilizing highly miniaturized
   antennas in the HF range for applications in GPS-denied environments
   including indoor and urban scenarios is proposed. A technique that
   combines a high resolution direction finding and radio triangulation
   utilizing a compact transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) antenna system is
   pursued. Numerical models are used to investigate wave propagation and
   scattering in complex indoor scenarios as a function of frequency. We
   choose HF band to minimize attenuation through walls and multipath in
   indoor environments. In order to achieve a compact system, a low-profile
   and highly miniaturized antenna (lambda/300 height and lambda.100
   lateral dimensions at 20 MHz) having omnidirectional, vertically
   polarized field is designed. At such low frequencies, accurate
   measurement of the phase difference between the signals at the Rx
   antennas having very small baseline is challenging. To address this
   issue, a biomimetic circuit that mimics the hearing mechanism of a fly
   (Ormia Ochracea) is utilized. With this circuit, very small phase
   differences are amplified to measurable values. The numerical
   simulations are used to analyze direction of arrival retrieval and
   source localization in highly cluttered environments. A compact system
   prototype is also realized and source tracking in complex indoor
   scenarios is successfully demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The performances of the soil moisture retrieval and assimilation
   algorithms using microwave observations rely on realistic estimates of
   brightness temperatures (T-B) from microwave emission models. This study
   identifies circumstances when current models fail to reliably relate
   near-surface soil moisture to an observed T-B at L-band; offers a
   plausible explanation of the physical cause of these failures; and
   recommends improvements needed so that L-band observations can provide
   reliable estimates of soil moisture, more universally. Physically
   consistent soil parameters and moisture at the surface were estimated by
   using dual-polarized C-band observations during an intensive field
   experiment, for an irrigation event and subsequent drydown. These
   derived parameters were used in conjunction with the in situ moisture in
   deeper layers and different moisture profiles within the moisture
   sensing depth to obtain estimates of H-pol T-B at L-band, that provided
   best matches with the observed T-B. The general assumptions of linear
   moisture distribution, with uniform or exponentially decaying weighting
   functions provided realistic T-B during the later stages of the drydown.
   However, the RMSDs of the T(B)s were upto 10.37 K during the wet period.
   In addition, the use of one value of moisture representing the entire
   moisture sensing depth during this highly dynamic stage of the drydown
   provides unrealistic estimates of emissivity, and hence, T-B at L-band.
   This study recommends use of a hydrological model to provide dynamic,
   realistic soil moisture profiles within the sensing depth and also an
   improved emissivity model that utilizes these detailed profiles for
   estimating T-B.}},

Abstract = {{Vibrational energy harvesting devices are often designed in a manner
   analogous to classical dynamic vibration absorbers (DVAs). An
   electromechanical mass-spring system is devised so as to resonate at the
   frequency most dominant in the environmental vibration spectrum; the
   consequent device oscillation is converted to a electrical signal which
   is harnessed for immediate usage or as a charging mechanism for a
   battery. The OVA is likewise designed but with the intention of inducing
   substantial inertial influence upon a host structure for vibration
   control purposes, either to globally dampen the vibration of the main
   body or, in an undamped configuration to ``absorb{''} the primary system
   vibration at a single frequency. This paper describes the development of
   an electromechanical mass-spring-damper which seeks to serve both goals
   of passive vibration control and energy harvesting. The device utilizes
   a piezoelectric film spring and a distributed mass layer so as to be
   suitable for the attenuation of surface vibrations and to convert a
   portion of the absorbed energy into electric power. The development and
   design of the device are presented and the results of realistic tests
   are provided to show both the potentials and the challenges encountered
   when attempting to superpose the goals of vibration control and energy
   harvesting. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With growing interest in understanding the magnitudes and sources of
   uncertainty in hydrological modeling, the difficult problem of
   characterizing model structure adequacy is now attracting considerable
   attention. Here, we examine this problem via a
   model-structure-independent approach based in information theory. In
   particular, we (a) discuss how to assess and compute the information
   content in multivariate hydrological data, (b) present practical methods
   for quantifying the uncertainty and shared information in data while
   accounting for heteroscedasticity, (c) show how these tools can be used
   to estimate the best achievable predictive performance of a model (for a
   system given the available data), and (d) show how model adequacy can be
   characterized in terms of the magnitude and nature of its aleatory
   uncertainty that cannot be diminished (and is resolvable only up to
   specification of its density), and its epistemic uncertainty that can,
   in principle, be suitably resolved by improving the model. An
   illustrative modeling example is provided using catchment-scale data
   from three river basins, the Leaf and Chunky River basins in the United
   States and the Chuzhou basin in China. Our analysis shows that the
   aleatory uncertainty associated with making catchment simulations using
   this data set is significant (approximate to 50\%). Further, estimated
   epistemic uncertainties of the HyMod, SAC-SMA, and Xinanjiang model
   hypotheses indicate that considerable room for model structural
   improvements remain.}},

Abstract = {{Shafts loaded by axial compressive forces constitute an area of
   considerable technical importance. The static stability and transverse
   vibrations of such shafts are the subjects of this work. Occasionally
   the shafts are tapered and of interest is the effect of employing
   functionally graded materials (FGMs), with properties varying in the
   axial direction, on the buckling load and lowest bending natural
   frequency. Here the shaft cross section is taken to be circular and
   three types of taper are treated: linear, sinusoidal and exponential.
   The shafts are assumed to have the same volume and length and to be
   subjected to a constant axial force. Euler-Bernoulli theory is used with
   the axial force handled by a buckling type approach. The problems that
   arise are computationally challenging but an efficient numerical
   strategy employing MAPLE (R)'s two-point boundary value solver has been
   developed. Typical results for a linear tapered pin-pin shaft where one
   end radius is twice the other, and the FGM model varies in a power law
   fashion with material properties increasing in the direction of
   increasing area, include doubling of the buckling load and first bending
   frequency increase of approximately 43\%, when compared with a
   homogeneous tapered shaft.}},

Abstract = {{In a classical light source, such as a laser, the photon number follows
   a Poissonian distribution. For quantum information processing and
   metrology applications, a non-classical emitter of single photons is
   required. A single quantum dot is an ideal source of single photons and
   such single-photon sources in the visible spectral range have been
   demonstrated with III-nitride and II-VI-based single quantum dots. It
   has been suggested that short-wavelength blue single-photon emitters
   would be useful for free-space quantum cryptography, with the
   availability of high-speed single-photon detectors in this spectral
   region. Here we demonstrate blue single-photon emission with electrical
   injection from an In0.25Ga0.75N quantum dot in a single nanowire. The
   emitted single photons are linearly polarized along the c axis of the
   nanowire with a degree of linear polarization of similar to 70\%.}},

Abstract = {{The unlicensed ISM spectrum is getting crowded by wireless local area
   network (WLAN) and wireless personal area network (WPAN) users and
   devices. Spectrum sharing within the same network of devices can be
   arbitrated by existing MAC protocols, but the coexistence between WPAN
   and WLAN (e.g., ZigBee and WiFi) remains a challenging problem. The
   traditional MAC protocols are ineffective in dealing with the disparate
   transmit-power levels, asynchronous time-slots, and incompatible PHY
   layers of such heterogeneous networks. Recent measurement studies have
   shown moderate-to-high WiFi traffic to severely impair the performance
   of coexisting ZigBee. We propose a novel mechanism, called cooperative
   carrier signaling (CCS), that exploits the inherent cooperation among
   ZigBee nodes to harmonize their coexistence with WiFi WLANs. CCS employs
   a separate ZigBee node to emit a carrier signal (busy tone) concurrently
   with the desired ZigBee's data transmission, thereby enhancing the
   ZigBee's visibility to WiFi. It employs an innovative way to
   concurrently schedule a busy tone and a data transmission without
   causing interference between them. We have implemented and evaluated CCS
   on the TinyOS/MICAz and GNURadio/USRP platforms. Our extensive
   experimental evaluation has shown that CCS reduces collision between
   ZigBee and WiFi by 50\% for most cases, and by up to 90\% in the
   presence of a high-level interference, all at negligible WiFi
   performance loss.}},

Abstract = {{Tail-biting codes are efficient coding techniques to eliminate the rate
   loss in conventional known-tail convolutional codes at a cost of
   increased complexity in decoders. In addition, tail-biting trellis
   representation of block codes makes the trellis-based maximum likelihood
   (ML) decoder desirable for implementation. Circular Viterbi algorithm
   (CVA) is introduced to decode the tail-biting codes for its decoding
   efficiency. However, its decoding process suffers from circular traps,
   which degrade the decoding efficiency. In this paper, we propose an
   efficient checking rule for the detection of circular traps. Based on
   this rule, a novel maximum likelihood (ML) decoding algorithm for
   tail-biting codes is presented. On tail-biting trellis, computational
   complexity and memory consumption of this decoder are significantly
   reduced comparing to other available ML decoders, such as the two-phase
   ML decoder. To further reduce the decoding complexity, we propose a new
   near-optimal decoding algorithm based on a simplified trap detection
   strategy. The performance of the above algorithms is validated with
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Underground utility lines being struck by mechanized excavators during
   construction or maintenance operations is a long standing problem.
   Besides the disruptions to public services, daily life, and commerce,
   utility strike accidents lead to injuries, fatalities, and property
   damages that cause significant financial loss. Utility strikes by
   excavation occur mainly because of the lack of an effective approach to
   synergize the geospatial utility locations and the movement of
   excavation equipment into a real-time, three-dimensional (3D) spatial
   context that is accessible to excavator operators. A critical aspect of
   enabling such a knowledge-based excavation approach is the geospatial
   utility data and its geometric modeling. Inaccurate and/or incomplete
   utility location information could lead to false instilled confidence
   and be counterproductive to the excavator operator. This paper addresses
   the computational details in geometric modeling of geospatial utility
   data for 3D visualization and proximity monitoring to support
   knowledge-based excavation. The details of the various stages in the
   life-cycle of underground utility geospatial data are described, and the
   inherent limitations that preclude the effective use of the data in
   downstream engineering applications such as excavation guidance are
   analyzed. Five key requirements - Interactivity, Information Richness,
   3-Dimensionality, Accuracy Characterization, and Extensibility - are
   identified as necessary for the consumption of geospatial utility data
   in location-sensitive engineering applications. A visualization
   framework named IDEAL that meets the outlined requirements is developed
   and presented in this paper to geometrically represent buried utility
   geospatial data and the movement of excavation equipment in a 3D
   emulated environment in real-time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper reports the metrics-based results of the Dst index part of
   the 20082009 GEM Metrics Challenge. The 20082009 GEM Metrics Challenge
   asked modelers to submit results for four geomagnetic storm events and
   five different types of observations that can be modeled by statistical,
   climatological or physics-based models of the magnetosphere-ionosphere
   system. We present the results of 30 model settings that were run at the
   Community Coordinated Modeling Center and at the institutions of various
   modelers for these events. To measure the performance of each of the
   models against the observations, we use comparisons of 1hour averaged
   model data with the Dst index issued by the World Data Center for
   Geomagnetism, Kyoto, Japan, and direct comparison of 1minute model data
   with the 1minute Dst index calculated by the United States Geological
   Survey. The latter index can be used to calculate spectral variability
   of model outputs in comparison to the index. We find that model rankings
   vary widely by skill score used. None of the models consistently perform
   best for all events. We find that empirical models perform well in
   general. Magnetohydrodynamics-based models of the global magnetosphere
   with inner magnetosphere physics (ring current model) included and
   stand-alone ring current models with properly defined boundary
   conditions perform well and are able to match or surpass results from
   empirical models. Unlike in similar studies, the statistical models used
   in this study found their challenge in the weakest events rather than
   the strongest events.}},

Abstract = {{Wideband autocorrelation radiometry (wideband AR) offers a deterministic
   method of remotely sensing microwave travel time tau(s) in planetary
   surface layers that are quasi-transparent to microwaves. Combining
   tau(s) with an independent estimate of the layer's average microwave
   index of refraction n(s) yields a measure of layer thickness whose
   accuracy is primarily limited by the accuracy of n(s). The technique
   requires that four conditions be met: 1) The correlation time of the
   radiometric signal must be less than the time difference at the
   radiometer between an upwelling ray that traverses the quasi-transparent
   layer once and a multiply reflected ray that traverses the
   quasi-transparent layer three times; 2) interfaces at the top and bottom
   of the layer must be effectively specular at the frequency of the
   radiometer; 3) dielectric transitions at the top and bottom of the layer
   must be distinct; and 4) rays transiting the layer must not be
   significantly absorbed or scattered. The performance of wideband AR for
   sensing dry snowpacks is governed by the relationship between system
   bandwidth and minimum snowpack thicknesses that can be sensed, the
   microwave indices of refraction of snowpacks and their underlying media,
   and the integration time required to depress the autocorrelation noise
   floor below the autocorrelation signal. Findings of this paper are that
   microwave travel times within dry snowpacks over frozen or thawed soils,
   or over ice, could be deterministically measured for snowpack
   thicknesses between 10 cm and 2 m using wideband AR sensors having
   10-GHz center frequencies, 1-GHz bandwidths, and 1-ms integration times.}},

Abstract = {{While many promising applications have been demonstrated for vertically
   aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) forests, lack of consistency in results
   (e.g., CNT quality, height, and density) continues to hinder knowledge
   transfer and commercialization. For example, it is well known that CNT
   growth can be influenced by small concentrations of water vapor, carbon
   deposits on the reactor wall, and experiment-to-experiment variations in
   pressure within the reaction chamber. However, even when these
   parameters are controlled during synthesis, we found that variations in
   ambient lab conditions can overwhelm attempts to perform parametric
   optimization studies. We established a standard growth procedure,
   including the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) recipe, while we varied
   other variables related to the furnace configuration and experimental
   procedure. Statistical analysis of 280 samples showed that ambient
   humidity, barometric pressure, and sample position in the CVD furnace
   contribute significantly to experiment-to-experiment variation. We
   investigated how these factors lead to CNT growth variation and
   recommend practices to improve process repeatability. Initial results
   using this approach reduced run-to-run variation in CNT forest height
   and density by more than 50\%.}},

Abstract = {{The null hypothesis was that pain pressure thresholds are the same for
   young healthy males and females and do not differ between the
   temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and muscle sites. The aim of the current
   study was to compare pain pressure threshold levels using an algometer
   with a convex-formed contact piece and pressure increase rates similar
   to those in conventional finger palpation, making the conditions more
   like clinical examination of painful spots with commonly used
   physiotherapeutic methods. Healthy subjects, 12 male, mean age 22.5 +/-
   1.62 (SD), and 12 female, 22.4 +/- 2.19 (SD), were enrolled. A
   transducer with a calibrated load range, 0 to 25 pounds, was used to
   measure pressure threshold levels for low (T1), VAS similar to 2, and
   high (T2), VAS similar to 8, pain levels bilaterally in the occipital
   (OC), sternocleidomastoid (SCM), upper trapezius (TU), transverse
   process of first vertebra (C1), and lateral temporomandibular joint
   (TMJ) areas. The null hypothesis was rejected. Levels T1 and T2 were
   significantly lower in the females in all tested areas. The range of the
   mean for T1 levels was 4.9 - 8.0 pounds for males and 3.2 - 5.1 pounds
   for females. For T2 levels, the range was 8.9 - 15.6 pounds for males
   and 6.2 - 10.3 pounds for females. Significant differences were found
   between muscle sites. These results support the use of different
   threshold levels: a) for males and females; and b) for different muscle

Abstract = {{This paper compares two optimal energy management methods for parallel
   hybrid electric vehicles using an Automatic Manual Transmission (AMT). A
   control-oriented model of the powertrain and vehicle dynamics is built
   first. The energy management is formulated as a typical optimal control
   problem to trade off the fuel consumption and gear shifting frequency
   under admissible constraints. The Dynamic Programming (DP) and
   Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) are applied to obtain the optimal
   solutions. Tuning with the appropriate co-states, the PMP solution is
   found to be very close to that from DP. The solution for the gear
   shifting in PMP has an algebraic expression associated with the
   vehicular velocity and can be implemented more efficiently in the
   control algorithm. The computation time of PMP is significantly less
   than DP.}},

Abstract = {{Fitts' law cannot be used to predict movement times (MTs) of bimanual
   tasks since no empirical relationships associating task difficulty and
   bimanual MT have been demonstrated yet. Development of a bimanual task
   difficulty index' has been challenged by the complex patterns of
   coordination involved in simultaneously performing two tasks, one with
   each hand, under a control system with limited visual and attentional
   resources. To address this fundamental issue in human motor performance,
   bimanual object transfers with the left and right hands to targets of
   various precision requirements and separated by different distances were
   studied in six healthy subjects. Visual resource allocation during task
   performance was used to identify primary' and secondary' hand movements
   in bimanual tasks. While the primary movement was similar to a unimanual
   movement, the secondary MT varied with its own, as well as the
   contralateral hand's task constraints. These results, which were stable
   and consistent across six subjects, provide preliminary evidence that
   visual behaviour, indicating closed-loop control, can be used to
   systematically derive bimanual MTs.
   Practitioner summary: A simple extension of Fitts' law cannot be used to
   predict movement times (MTs) of bimanual tasks since there is no
   consensus on the definition of a bimanual task difficulty index' in the
   literature. In this paper, we have approached this problem by using
   visual resource allocation patterns to systematically derive bimanual
   MTs.}},

   capability}},
Journal = {{ERGONOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{667-681}},

Abstract = {{Environmental obstructions that workers encounter can kinematically
   limit the postures that they can achieve. However, such obstructions can
   also provide an opportunity for additional support by bracing with the
   hand, thigh or other body part. The reaction forces on bracing surfaces,
   which are in addition to those acting at the feet and task hand, are
   hypothesised to improve force exertion capability, and become required
   inputs to biomechanical analysis of tasks with bracing. The effects of
   kinematic constraints and associated bracing opportunities on isometric
   hand force were quantified in a laboratory study of 22 men and women.
   Analyses of one-hand maximal push, pull and lift tasks demonstrated that
   bracing surfaces available at the thighs and non-task hand enabled
   participants to exert an average of 43\% more force at the task hand.
   Task hand force direction deviated significantly from the nominal
   direction for exertions performed with bracing at both medium and low
   task hand locations.
   Practitioner summary: This study quantifies the effect of bracing on
   kinematically constrained force exertions. Knowledge that appropriate
   bracing surfaces can substantially increase hand force is critical to
   the evaluation of task-oriented strength capability. Force estimates may
   also involve large off-axis components, which have clear implications
   for ergonomic analyses of manual tasks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies iteration convergence of Kronecker graphical lasso
   (KGLasso) algorithms for estimating the covariance of an i.i.d. Gaussian
   random sample under a sparse Kronecker-product covariance model and MSE
   convergence rates. The KGlasso model, originally called the transposable

   regularized covariance models with an application to missing data
   imputation,{''} Ann. Appl. Statist., vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 764-790, 2010],
   implements a pair of l(1) penalties on each Kronecker factor to enforce
   sparsity in the covariance estimator. The KGlasso algorithm generalizes
   Glasso, introduced by Yuan and Lin {[}{''}Model selection and estimation
   in the Gaussian graphical model,{''} Biometrika, vol. 94, pp. 19-35,
   2007] and Banerjee et al. {[}{''}Model selection through sparse maximum
   likelihood estimation for multivariate Gaussian or binary data,{''} J.
   Mach. Learn. Res., vol. 9, pp. 485-516, Mar. 2008], to estimate
   covariances having Kronecker product form. It also generalizes the
   unpenalized ML flip-flop (FF) algorithm of Dutilleul {[}{''}The MLE
   algorithm for the matrix normal distribution,{''} J. Statist. Comput.
   Simul., vol. 64, pp. 105-123, 1999] and Werner et al. {[}{''}On

   IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 56, no. 2, pp. 478-491, Feb. 2008] to
   estimation of sparse Kronecker factors. We establish that the KGlasso
   iterates converge pointwise to a local maximum of the penalized
   likelihood function. We derive high dimensional rates of convergence to
   the true covariance as both the number of samples and the number of
   variables go to infinity. Our results establish that KGlasso has
   significantly faster asymptotic convergence than Glasso and FF.
   Simulations are presented that validate the results of our analysis. For
   example, for a sparse 10 000 x 10 000 covariance matrix equal to the
   Kronecker product of two 100 x 100 matrices, the root mean squared error
   of the inverse covariance estimate using FF is 2 times larger than that
   obtainable using KGlasso for sample size of n = 100.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present mass spectra showing organic species with
   mass-to-charge ratios between 15 and 900 sampled from near-atmospheric
   pressure, non-premixed, opposed-flow flames of acetylene, ethylene, and
   propane using an aerosol mass spectrometer with flash vaporization.
   Near-threshold photoionization was achieved by synchrotron-generated
   tunable vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) light. Among the three different fuels,
   we observed variation in the mass progression, peak intensities, and
   isomeric content identifiable in photoionization-efficiency curves. The
   results indicate that different pathways contribute to the molecular
   growth of soot precursors and that the significance of these mechanisms
   is likely to depend on the fuel structure and/or flame conditions.
   Previous work has highlighted thermodynamic propensities for precursor
   formation; however, our results suggest that kinetic mechanisms play a
   role in determining the partitioning of soot precursor isomers under the
   conditions investigated here. Evidence for aliphatic-bridged and
   oxygenated species was also observed. Such species have been proposed as
   a possible precursor to particle inception following cluster formation
   but have never been confirmed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Ultra-precision manufacturing (UPM) machines are used to fabricate and
   measure complex parts having micrometer-level features and
   nanometer-level tolerances/surface finishes. Consequently, low-frequency
   residual vibrations that occur during the motion of the machines' axes
   must be mitigated. A long-standing rule of thumb in vibration isolation
   system design is to locate the isolators in such a way that all
   vibration modes are decoupled. This paper uses the 2D dynamics of a
   passively isolated system to show that coupling the vibration modes of
   the isolated system by altering the location of the isolators provides
   conditions which allow for the drastic reduction of residual vibrations.
   An objective function which minimizes residual vibration energy is
   defined. Perturbation analyses of the objective function reveal that the
   recommended practice of decoupling the vibration modes more often than
   not leads to sub-optimal results in terms of residual vibration
   reduction. The analyses also provide guidelines for correctly locating
   the isolators so as to reduce residual vibrations. Simulations and
   experiments conducted on a passively isolated ultra-precision machine
   tool are used to validate the findings of the paper; a 5-fold reduction
   of the dominant residual vibrations of the machine tool is achieved
   without sacrificing vibration isolation quality (i.e.,
   transmissibility). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   arrangement of acceptor/anchoring groups within a conjugated dye frame
   is important in suppressing improper charge recombination in DSSCs are
   discussed. Separating the electron acceptor from the anchoring unit in

Abstract = {{Providing sustainable mobility is a major challenge that will require
   new vehicle and fuel technologies. Alternative and future fuels are the
   subject of considerable research and public interest. A simple approach
   is presented that can be used in science education lectures at the high
   school or undergraduate level to provide students with an understanding
   of the elemental composition of future fuels. Starting from key fuel
   requirements and overlaying the chemical trends evident in the periodic
   table, it can be demonstrated that future chemical fuels will be based
   on three elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Liquid hydrocarbons are
   the most convenient transportation fuels because of their physical state
   (easier to handle than gases or solids) and their high gravimetric and
   volumetric energy densities. Challenges remain for storage of
   electricity and gaseous fuels. Recognizing the need to address climate
   change driven by increasing emissions of CO2, sustainable mobility will
   be powered by low-CO2 hydrogen, low-CO2 hydrocarbons, low-CO2
   oxygenates, low-CO2 electricity, or a combination of the above.}},

Title = {{Hydroelastic response and stability of a hydrofoil in viscous flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{40-57}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to investigate the hydroelastic
   response and stability of a flexible hydrofoil in viscous flow. The
   focus is on viscous effects, such as laminar to turbulent transition and
   stall, on the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) response and
   hydroelastic stability of flexible hydrofoils. The numerical approach is
   based on the coupling between a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics
   (CFD) solver, CFX, and a simple two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) system
   that simulates the tip section bend and twist deformations of a
   cantelivered, rectangular hydrofoil. The hydrodynamic loading is assumed
   to be uniform in the spanwise direction, and the hydrofoil is assumed to
   undergo bend and twist deformation along the spanwise direction only.
   The CFD solver is first validated by comparing numerical predictions
   with experimental measurements of the lift, drag, and moment
   coefficients of a rigid NACA0012 hydrofoil over a wide range of Reynolds
   numbers and angles of attack. The coupled viscous FSI solver is then
   validated by comparing numerical predictions with experimental
   measurements of (i) the lift coefficient of a rigid (stainless steel)
   NACA66 hydrofoil and (ii) the tip section displacement of a flexible
   (POM Polyacetate) NACA66 hydrofoil with the same initial (undeformed)
   geometry. The hydrodynamic responses of the rigid and flexible NACA66
   hydrodfoils are compared to identify FSI effects in viscous flow,
   including transition, stall, and static divergence. The results show
   that the flexible hydrofoil undergoes a clockwise twist deformation
   because the center of pressure is to the left of the elastic axis
   (center of twist), which increases the effective angle of attack and
   moves the center of pressure toward the leading edge; the resultant
   increase in lift and moment will further increase the effective angle of
   attack until the twist capacity is exceeded, i.e. static divergence or
   material failure occurs. The results show that viscous effects tend to
   delay or suppress divergence because the center of pressure moves toward
   the midchord at high effective angles of attack due to large-scale flow
   separation, which significantly limits the twisting moment. However,
   viscous effects may lead to stall, buffeting, flutter, or resonance at
   high angles of attack due to periodic shedding of large-scale vortices.

Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Micro-dielectric barrier discharges (mDBDs) are known for being stable,
   high-pressure and non-thermal plasma sources. mDBD arrays consist of
   micro-plasma devices (10-100 mu m) in which the radio frequency
   (rf)-excited electrodes are covered by dielectrics. In certain
   applications, independent control of individual mDBDs in an array is
   required for charge extraction to treat dielectric surfaces. When using
   the mDBDs to produce plumes of charged species, there are potential
   direct or indirect interactions between the mDBD devices. In this paper,
   we discuss the characteristics of atmospheric mDBD arrays sustained in
   N-2 with an O-2 impurity using results from a two-dimensional
   simulation. The device of interest consists of a sandwich structure
   using layers of dc and rf biased electrodes to help shape the plume. We
   found that the adjacency of the mDBDs and the dielectric properties of
   the materials being treated are important to the interactions between
   mDBDs in the array. Scaling laws are presented for operating
   characteristics of these mDBD arrays as a function of material
   properties, geometry, driving voltage waveform and gas mixture.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Current screening algorithms for hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC) view each testing interval independently, without
   considering prior test results. We investigated whether measurements of
   alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), over time, can be used to identify patients
   most likely to develop HCC.
   METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study using data from
   subjects in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment Against
   Cirrhosis trial; 82 patients with HCC were matched 1: 3 to individuals
   without HCC (controls), using bootstrap methods to ensure similar
   follow-up times between groups. We assessed the independent association
   between development of HCC and the following: (1) most recent level of
   AFP, (2) standard deviation in level of AFP, and (3) rate of increase in
   AFP using a multiple logistic regression that included patient-specific
   risk factors such as age, platelet count, and smoking status.
   RESULTS: In bivariable analysis, all 3 AFP metrics were associated with
   HCC development; the most strongly associated was the standard deviation
   of AFP (odds ratio, 1.03 per unit increase in standard deviation; P <
   .001). Incorporating the standard deviation of AFP and rate of AFP
   increase, along with patient-specific risk factors, improved the
   prognostic accuracy to an area under the receiver-operating
   characteristic curve of 0.81, compared with 0.76 when only the most
   recent AFP level was used.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of AFP test results can more accurately identify
   patients with hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis most likely
   to develop HCC, compared with most recent AFP test results.}},

Abstract = {{The surface impedance and dispersion equation of a printed-circuit
   tensor impedance surface (PCTIS) are derived using a modified transverse
   resonance technique. A PCTIS consists of a subwavelength-patterned
   metallic cladding over a grounded dielectric substrate. The metallic
   cladding is analytically modeled as a tensor impedance sheet. An
   explicit expression is derived for the effective surface impedance of
   the PCTIS using a transmission-line approach. First, the
   surface-impedance expression is found for a printed-circuit scalar
   impedance surface using the transverse resonance technique. Next, a
   modified transverse resonance technique is applied to an idealized
   tensor impedance boundary condition (TIBC) to find its dispersion
   equation. Finally, the analysis of the printed-circuit scalar impedance
   is combined with that of the idealized TIBC to find the tensor surface
   impedance and dispersion equation of a PCTIS. A discussion of the
   principal axes and the propagation of TM and TE waves is provided. The
   special case of electrically thin PCTISs is also analyzed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A lumped-element unit cell for designing compact beam-forming networks
   (BFNs) is proposed. It is a reciprocal four-port network, which is
   lossless, isolated, and matched at all ports. The unit cell is designed
   to behave as planar and compact directional couplers with both arbitrary
   output amplitude and phase distributions, as well as crossovers with
   arbitrary output phase distributions. For both cases, design equations
   are derived. The design procedure is validated numerically and
   experimentally through several examples. The versatility of the unit
   cell allows the design of BFNs using only the proposed network topology.
   As an example, a 4 x 4 Butler matrix is implemented. A strong size
   reduction is also achieved with respect to classical designs thanks to
   the lumped-element implementation. The prototype footprint is
   approximately 25 times smaller than typical transmission-line-based
   Butler matrices. The structure shows also a very small area compared to
   state-of-the-art miniaturized 4 x 4 Butler matrix designs. Measurement
   results confirm the behavior of the Butler matrix as a BFN. The achieved
   bandwidth is approximately 8\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a feedback controller that allows MABEL, which is a
   kneed planar bipedal robot with 1-m-long legs, to accommodate terrain
   that presents large unexpected increases and decreases in height. The
   robot is provided no information regarding where the change in terrain
   height occurs and by how much. A finite-state machine is designed that
   manages transitions among controllers for flat-ground walking,
   stepping-up and -down, and a trip reflex. If the robot completes a step,
   the depth of a step-down or the height of a step-up can be immediately
   estimated at impact from the lengths of the legs and the angles of the
   robot's joints. The change in height can be used to invoke a proper
   control response. On the other hand, if the swing leg impacts an
   obstacle during a step, or has a premature impact with the ground, a
   trip reflex is triggered on the basis of specially designed contact
   switches on the robot's shins, contact switches at the end of each leg,
   and the current configuration of the robot. The design of each control
   mode and the transition conditions among them are presented. This paper
   concludes with experimental results of MABEL (blindly) accommodating
   various types of platforms, including ascent of a 12.5-cm-high platform,
   stepping-off an 18.5-cm-high platform, and walking over a platform with
   multiple ascending and descending steps.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the performance of a matched subspace detector (MSD) where
   the test signal vector is assumed to reside in an unknown, low-rank
   subspace that must be estimated from finite, noisy, signal-bearing
   training data. Under both a stochastic and deterministic model for the
   test vector, subspace estimation errors due to limited training data
   degrade the performance of the standard plug-in detector, relative to
   that of an oracle detector. To avoid some of this performance loss, we
   utilize and extend recent results from random matrix theory (RMT) that
   precisely quantify the quality of the subspace estimate as a function of
   the eigen-SNR, dimensionality of the system, and the number of training
   samples. We exploit this knowledge of the subspace estimation accuracy
   to derive from first-principles a new RMT detector and to characterize
   the associated ROC performance curves of the RMT and plug-in detectors.
   Using more than the a critical number of informative components, which
   depends on the training sample size and eigen-SNR parameters of training
   data, will result in a performance loss that our analysis quantifies in
   the large system limit. We validate our asymptotic predictions with
   simulations on moderately sized systems.}},

Title = {{Robust manufacturing line design with controlled moderate robustness in
   bottleneck buffer time to manage stochastic inter-task times}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{382-391}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Task time variations in a manufacturing line can result in a longer time
   to complete tasks than a given cycle time, leading to line stoppage and
   loss of production time. In practice, a portion of the cycle time is
   often allocated as a predefined fixed-size buffer time, determined based
   on experience, to account for such uncertain variations for a paced line
   without storage-buffers between stations. However, the size of the
   required buffer time in each station depends on the variation levels of
   task times and the desired conservatism level for preventing cycle time
   violation. In addition, there are uncertainties in other non-value
   adding activity times in stations, known as inter-task times. Although
   many studies on stochastic manufacturing line design focused on
   minimizing the cost incurred when the cycle time is exceeded due to task
   time variations, they mostly disregarded the inter-task times.
   Furthermore, it is worth studying the simultaneous effect of the
   manufacturing time uncertainty level and that of the conservatism level
   on the cycle time. This paper proposes a new method for moderately
   robust manufacturing line design that incorporates the conservatism
   level and uncertainties in the task and inter-task times. A new
   interpretation of the non-productive times in stations is presented by
   introducing the concept of the alpha-fractal buffer time to manage the
   effect of manufacturing time uncertainties. To overcome the problem of
   excessive robustness, a moderate robust approach with conservatism-level
   flexibility is used, focusing on the cycle time in the bottleneck
   station. The effect of the uncertainties and conservatism levels on the
   cycle time is analyzed through numerical examples. This study can be
   used for improving a manufacturing system in which uncertainties in
   tasks and inter-task times significantly degrade its productivity. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a miniaturized, chip-scale Penning cell array
   for sputter-ion pumping. In a 2.5 cm(3) package, a 0.2 cm(3) pump
   architecture with 1.5 mm diameter cells in a 4 x 2 array reduces
   pressure from 1 Torr (133.3 Pa) to < 200 mTorr (26.6 Pa) in about 10 h,
   and from 115 mTorr (15.3 Pa) to < 10 mTorr (1.33 Pa) in 4 h. The rate of
   molecular removal in this range of pressures is 0.09 x 10(13) to 1.17 x
   10(13) molecules/s. Experiments show that the architecture is capable of
   igniting and sustaining the plasma required for operating at a pressure
   at least as low as 1.5 mu Torr (200 nPa). The advantage of the Penning
   cell architecture reported here in comparison to other chip-scale ion
   pump architectures is the drastically reduced operating pressures that
   can be achieved and maintained. The microdischarge requires 450-600 V
   applied across the device and consumes 100-250 mW. The Penning cell
   array architecture shows significant promise for power efficient
   high-vacuum pumping in chip-scale and smaller systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents in-plane electrostatic comb-drive actuators with
   stroke as large as 245 mu m that is achieved by employing a novel
   clamped paired double parallelogram (C-DP-DP) flexure mechanism. The
   C-DP-DP flexuremechanism design offers high bearing direction stiffness
   K-ae while maintaining low motion direction stiffness K-y over a large
   range of motion direction displacement. The resulting high (K-ae/K-y)
   ratio mitigates the onset of sideways snap-in instability, thereby
   offering significantly greater actuation stroke compared with existing
   designs. Further improvement is achieved by reinforcing the individual
   beams in this flexure mechanism. While the traditional paired double
   parallelogram (DP-DP) flexure design with comb gap G = 3 mu m and
   flexure beam length L-1 = 1 mm results in a 50-mu m stroke before
   snap-in, the reinforced C-DP-DP design with the same comb gap and
   flexure beam length achieves a stroke of 141 mu m. Furthermore, this
   C-DP-DP flexure design provides a 215-mu m stroke with G = 4 mu m and a
   245-mu m stroke with G = 6 mu m. The presented work includes closed-form
   stiffness expressions for the reinforced C-DP-DP flexure, a design
   procedure for selecting dimensions of the overall comb-drive actuator,
   microfabrication of some representative actuators, and experimental
   measurements demonstrating the large stroke.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to evaluate the relationship between cell division and protein
   expression when using commercial poly(ethylenimine) (PEI)-based
   polyplexes. The membrane dye PKH26 was used to assess cell division, and
   cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) was used to monitor protein expression.
   When analyzed at the whole population level, a greater number of cells
   divided than expressed protein, regardless of the level of protein
   expression observed, giving apparent consistency with the hypothesis
   that protein expression requires cells to pass through mitosis in order
   for the transgene to overcome the nuclear membrane. However, when the
   polyplex-exposed population was evaluated for the amount of division in
   the protein-expressing subpopulation, it was observed that substantial
   amounts of expression had occurred in the absence of division. Indeed,
   in HeLa S3 cells, this represented the majority of expressing cells. Of
   interest, the doubling time for both cell lines was slowed by similar to
   2-fold upon exposure to polyplexes. This change was not altered by the
   origin of the plasmid DNA (pDNA) transgene promoter (cytomegalovirus
   (CMV) or elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1 alpha)). Gene expression arrays
   in polyplex-exposed HeLa S3 cells showed upregulation of cell cycle
   arrest genes and downregulation of genes related to mitosis. Chemokine,
   interleukin, and toll-like receptor genes were also upregulated,
   suggesting activation of proinflammatory pathways. In summary, we find
   evidence that a cell division-independent expression pathway exists, and
   that polyplex exposure slows cell division and increases inflammatory
   response.}},

Abstract = {{Solving wireless packet retransmission problems (WPRTPs) using network
   coding (NC) approach is increasingly attracting research efforts.
   However, existing researches are almost all focused on solutions in
   Galois field GF(2), and consequently, the solutions found by these
   schemes are usually less optimal. In this paper, we focus on optimal
   NC-based scheme for perfect WPRTPs (P-WPRTPs) where, with respect to
   each receiver, a packet is either requested by or already known to it.
   The number of retransmitted packets in optimal NC-based solutions to
   P-WPRTPs is firstly analyzed and proved. Then, random network
   coding-based optimal scheme (RNCOPT) is proposed for P-WRPTPs. RNCOPT is
   optimal in the sense that it guarantees to obtain a valid solution with
   minimum number of packet retransmissions. Furthermore, in RNCOPT, each
   coding vector is generated using a publicly known pseudorandom function
   with a randomly selected seed. The seed, instead of the coding vector,
   is used as decoding information to be retransmitted together with the
   coded packet. Thus, packet overhead of RNCOPT is reduced further.
   Extensive simulations show that RNCOPT distinctively outperforms some
   previous typical schemes for P-WPRTPs in saving the number of
   retransmitted packets. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   microscopic mechanism is mostly unknown. In our work, molecular dynamics
   simulations were performed to explore the dynamic characteristics of the
   heterogeneous nucleation of supersaturated argon vapor onto a spherical
   solid nanoparticle. We discuss the effect of the cooling rate on the
   evolution of the system temperature, the cluster distribution, the
   cluster size, and the nucleation rate during the nucleation process. Our
   results show that the pre-existing nucleus plays an important role in
   the cluster formation stage. Furthermore, in the system with a
   pre-existing heterogeneous nucleus, a critical cooling rate (1.8 x
   10(-9) J.s(-1)) exists at which homogeneous nucleation emerges and
   coexists with heterogeneous nucleation but heterogeneous nucleation
   still dominates the entire nucleation process.}},

Abstract = {{Linear flux-switching permanent magnet (LFSPM) motors with both
   permanent magnets and armature windings on the short primary mover have
   attracted considerable attention due to their simple and cheap stator
   which only consists of iron. Hence, this kind of liner motor is very
   suitable for long stator applications such as in urban rail
   transportations. However, the conventional LFSPM motors directly split
   from rotary FSPM motor suffer from drawbacks such as unbalanced magnetic
   circuit of end coil, heavy mover, and bigger cogging force and force
   ripple. Modular LFSPM (MLFSPM) motors can mitigate the problem of
   unbalanced magnetic circuit of end coil. But some MLFSPM motors with
   different stator/mover pole pitch tau(s)/tau(m) = 12/14, 12/10 don't
   have complementary phase armature windings, which will lead to
   asymmetrical and non-sinusoidal back-electromotive force, bigger cogging
   force and thrust force ripple. The key of this paper is to propose,
   investigate, and compare four complementary and modular structures for
   the LFSPM motors with different tau(s)/tau(m). The electromagnetic
   performance and dimensions of the proposed complementary MLFSPM motors
   with different tau(s)/tau(m) are investigated, compared and confirmed by
   the means of finite element analysis and experimental results. Based on
   the analysis results, two complementary MLFSPM motors with tau(s)/tau(m)
   = 12/13 are chosen to be the two best motors, which can offer the
   biggest thrust force, relatively smaller cogging force and thrust force
   ripple, and shorter mover length.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous/nanocrystalline coatings are useful in high strength and
   wear-resistant applications. In the present study, the microstructural
   evolution of a nanocrystalline high performance steel coatings developed
   by different spray processes along with a novel ``hybrid thermal
   spray{''} technique was studied. The hybrid-spray process combines arc
   and high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) techniques, in which the molten metal
   at the arcing tip is atomized and rapidly propelled toward the substrate
   by HVOF jet. This so-called hybrid concept offers the benefits of
   productivity of electric arc spray combined with improved coating
   densities of HVOF. The microstructural characterization of the
   hybrid-spray coatings was performed by x-ray diffraction, electron
   microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry, and then compared
   with coatings of the similar material developed by plasma-, HVOF-, and
   arc-spray processes individually. The HVOF- and plasma-spray coatings
   showed amorphous structures with very fine nanocrystals embedded,
   whereas hybrid- and arc-spray techniques yielded completely crystalline
   coatings with grain size in the range of several nanometers. The final
   microstructures in different spray processes could be attributed to the
   precursor materials employed, process temperatures, and cooling rates

Abstract = {{Current methods for studying oligodendrocyte myelination using primary
   neurons are limited by the time, cost and reproducibility of myelination
   in vitro. Nanofibers with diameters of >0.4 mu m fabricated from
   electrospinning of liquid polystyrene are suitable scaffolds for
   concentric membrane wrapping by oligodendrocytes. With the advent of
   aligned electrospinning technology, nanofibers can be rapidly
   fabricated, standardized, and configured into various densities and
   patterns as desired. Notably, the minimally permissive culture
   environment of fibers provides investigators with an opportunity to
   explore the autonomous oligodendrocyte cellular processes underlying
   differentiation and myelination. The simplicity of the system is
   conducive to monitoring oligodendrocyte proliferation, migration,
   differentiation and membrane wrapping in the absence of neuronal
   signals. Here we describe protocols for the fabrication and preparation
   of nanofibers aligned on glass coverslips for the study of membrane
   wrapping by rodent oligodendrocytes. The entire protocol can be
   completed within 2 weeks.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We hypothesize that intervertebral disc (IVD) cells from
   distinct region respond differently to oxygen environment, and that IVD
   cells from patients with disc degeneration can benefit from hypoxia
   condition. Therefore, we aimed to determine the transcriptional response
   and extracellular matrix (ECM) production of nucleus pulposus (NP) and
   annulus fibrosus (AF) cells to different oxygen tension.
   Method: Human NP and AF from degenerated IVD were seeded in 3D scaffolds
   and subjected to varying oxygen tension (2\% and 20\%) for 3 weeks.
   Changes in ECM were evaluated using quantitative real-time reverse
   transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, histological and
   immunohistological analyses.
   Results: Hypoxia significantly enhances NP cells phenotype, which
   resulted in greater production of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and
   collagen type II within the constructs and the cells expressed higher
   levels of genes encoding NP ECM. A significantly stronger fluorescent
   signal for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1 alpha) as also found in the
   NP cells under the hypoxic than normoxic condition. However, there was
   little effect of hypoxia on the AF cells.
   Conclusions: The NP and AF cells respond differently to hypoxia
   condition on the 3D scaffold, and hypoxia could enhance NP phenotype.
   When used in concert with appropriate scaffold material, human NP cells
   from degenerated disc could be regenerated for tissue engineering
   application. (C) 2013 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Abstract = {{The extension of the surrogate-based recurrence framework approach to
   account for time-varying swept flow effects under dynamic stall
   conditions is described. Using full-order solutions generated by the
   OVERFLOW computational fluid dynamics code, the surrogate-based
   recurrence framework reduced-order modeling approach is shown to
   effectively mimic full-order solutions of unsteady lift, moment, and
   drag under dynamic stall conditions while maintaining the computational
   efficiency associated with semiempirical dynamic stall models. This
   level of functionality represents a new capability for rotary-wing
   aeroelasticity applications. Furthermore, a generalized kriging
   formulation based on nonstationary Gaussian process modeling is
   implemented in a tractable manner by locally optimizing the
   high-dimensional likelihood function in the vicinity of the stationary
   solution. The resulting nonstationary covariance structures are shown to
   significantly improve the accuracy of the surrogate-based recurrence
   framework predicted moment stall characteristics compared to a
   stationary model. It is shown that the nonstationary surrogate-based
   recurrence framework approach is better able to adapt to abrupt changes
   in airload behavior caused by the underlying dynamic stall vortex
   dynamics. The results indicate that the surrogate-based recurrence
   framework approach based on nonstationary Gaussian process models is a
   promising alternative to widely used semiempirical rotorcraft dynamic
   stall models that cannot account for the effects of time-varying
   velocity components associated with forward flight.}},

Journal = {{CLIMATE DYNAMICS}},

Abstract = {{This study extends a stochastic downscaling methodology to generation of
   an ensemble of hourly time series of meteorological variables that
   express possible future climate conditions at a point-scale. The
   stochastic downscaling uses general circulation model (GCM) realizations
   and an hourly weather generator, the Advanced WEather GENerator
   (AWE-GEN). Marginal distributions of factors of change are computed for
   several climate statistics using a Bayesian methodology that can weight
   GCM realizations based on the model relative performance with respect to
   a historical climate and a degree of disagreement in projecting future
   conditions. A Monte Carlo technique is used to sample the factors of
   change from their respective marginal distributions. As a comparison
   with traditional approaches, factors of change are also estimated by
   averaging GCM realizations. With either approach, the derived factors of
   change are applied to the climate statistics inferred from historical
   observations to re-evaluate parameters of the weather generator. The
   re-parameterized generator yields hourly time series of meteorological
   variables that can be considered to be representative of future climate
   conditions. In this study, the time series are generated in an ensemble
   mode to fully reflect the uncertainty of GCM projections, climate
   stochasticity, as well as uncertainties of the downscaling procedure.
   Applications of the methodology in reproducing future climate conditions
   for the periods of 2000-2009, 2046-2065 and 2081-2100, using the period
   of 1962-1992 as the historical baseline are discussed for the location
   of Firenze (Italy). The inferences of the methodology for the period of
   2000-2009 are tested against observations to assess reliability of the
   stochastic downscaling procedure in reproducing statistics of
   meteorological variables at different time scales.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Different stress strain definitions are used in the
   literature to measure the elastic modulus in aortic tissue. There is no
   agreement as to which stress strain definition should be implemented.
   The purpose of this study is to show how different results are given by
   the various definitions of stress strain used and to recommend a
   specific definition when testing aortic tissues.
   Methods: Circumferential specimens from three patients with ascending
   thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) were obtained from the greater curvature
   and their tensile properties were tested uniaxially. Three stress
   definitions (second Piola-Kirchhoff stress, engineering stress and true
   stress) and four strain definitions (Almansi-Hamel strain, Green-St.
   Venant strain, engineering strain and true strain) were used to
   determine the elastic modulus.
   Results: We found that the Almansi-Hamel strain definition exhibited the
   highest non-linear stress strain relation and consequently may
   overestimate the elastic modulus when using different stress definitions
   (second Piola-Kirchhoff stress, engineering stress and true stress). The
   Green-St. Venant strain definition yielded the lowest non-linear stress
   strain relation using different definitions of stress, which may
   underestimate the values of elastic modulus. Engineering stress and
   strain definitions are only valid for small strains and displacements,
   which make them impractical when analysing soft tissues. We show that
   the effect of varying the stress definition on the elastic modulus
   measurements is significant for maximum elastic modulus but not when
   calculating the hypertensive elastic modulus.
   Conclusions: It is important to consider which stress strain definition
   is employed when analysing soft tissues. Although the true stress true
   strain definition exhibits a non-linear relation, we favour it in tissue
   mechanics because it gives more accurate measurements of the material's
   response using the instantaneous values. (C) 2013 European Society for

Title = {{Effect of biodiesel and ethanol on load limits of high-efficiency
   premixed low-temperature combustion in a diesel engine}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{773-778}},

Abstract = {{The fuel effect of diesel, biodiesel and biodiesel-ethanol on load
   limits of high-efficiency premixed low temperature combustion (LTC),
   defined by nitrogen oxides (NOx) <= 1 g/kg-fuel, smoke <= 0.5 filter
   smoke number (FSN) and combustion efficiency >= 96\%, is investigated
   using a diesel engine in this study. Low load operation range is limited
   by a drop in combustion efficiency for all three test fuels. High load
   operation range is limited by a sharp increase in smoke with diesel
   fuel. Biodiesel produces lower smoke at high load but still exceed the
   limit of 0.5 FSN. Unlike diesel and biodiesel, smoke is no longer the
   limiting factor for high load operation with biodiesel-ethanol fuel. A
   blend of 20\% ethanol in biodiesel results in ultra-low smoke emission
   (maximum FSN less than 0.25), which is thought to be caused by the joint
   effects of better fuel air mixing and higher fuel oxygen fraction.
   Since the high load operating limit of biodiesel-ethanol is caused by a
   drop in combustion efficiency and not smoke as for the other fuels,
   biodiesel-ethanol was used to further extend the LTC load limits at a
   higher boosting pressure. When intake pressure is increased from 120 to
   150 kPa, biodiesel-ethanol still demonstrates ultra-low smoke, and its
   high-efficiency LTC operating range is extended from 0.40-0.65 to
   0.35-0.82 MPa indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). (c) 2012

Abstract = {{In this paper, Lyapunov stability and strong passivity are defined for
   nonlinear descriptor systems. The new concepts facilitate the
   formulation of the relationship between the stability and passivity of
   nonlinear descriptor systems. A Lyapunov stability theorem which
   describes a sufficient condition for the systems to be globally
   asymptotically stable and of index one is derived. By the Lyapunov
   stability theorem, the connection between Lyapunov stability and strong
   passivity is established. Furthermore, strong passivity of feedback
   systems is discussed and two passivity theorems are given. Using the
   given passivity theorems, strongly absolute stability of Lur'e type
   descriptor systems is discussed. The obtained strongly absolute
   stability criterion is shown to be more general and less conservative
   than the existing methods. Finally, two examples are used to illustrate
   the advantages and effectiveness of the obtained methods.}},

Abstract = {{Oxide breakdown has become an increasingly pressing reliability issue in
   modern very large scale integration design with ultrathin oxides. The
   conventional guard-band methodology assumes uniformly thin oxide
   thickness, resulting in overly pessimistic reliability estimation that
   severely degrades system performance. In this paper, we present the use
   of limited post-fabrication measurements of oxide thicknesses from
   on-chip sensors to aid in the chip-level oxide breakdown reliability
   management. A key challenge, which is the focus of this paper, is
   precisely predicting and managing the reliability condition of each chip
   with a limited number of measurements and quantifying the tradeoff
   between reliability margin and system performance. Given the
   post-fabrication measurements, chip oxide breakdown reliability can be
   formulated as a conditional distribution that allows one to achieve a
   significantly more accurate chip lifetime estimation. The estimation is
   then used to individually tune the supply voltage of each chip for
   performance maximization while maintaining or improving the reliability.
   Experimental results show that, by using 25 measurements, the proposed
   method can achieve an average of 19\% performance improvement, and a
   27\% maximum for a design with up to 50 million devices, with an average
   operation time of approximately 0.4 s per chip.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To improve the quality of liver stereotactic body radiation
   therapy (SBRT) treatments, a novel 4 pi framework was developed with
   accompanying algorithms to optimize non-coplanar beam orientations and
   fluences. The dose optimization is performed on a patient-specific
   deliverable beam geometry solution space, parameterized with patient and
   linear accelerator gantry orientations.
   Methods and Materials: Beams causing collision between the gantry and
   the couch or patient were eliminated by simulating all beam orientations
   using a precise computer assisted design model of the linear accelerator
   and a human subject. Integrated beam orientation and fluence map
   optimizations were performed on remaining beams using a greedy column
   generation method. Testing of the new method was performed on 10 liver
   SBRT cases previously treated with 50 to 60 Gy in 5 fractions using
   volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). For each patient, both 14 and
   22 non-coplanar fields were selected and optimized to meet the objective
   of >= 95\% of the planning target volume (PTV) covered by 100\% of the
   prescription dose. Doses to organs at risk, normal liver volumes
   receiving <15 Gy, integral dose, and 50\% dose spillage volumes were
   compared against the delivered clinical VMAT plans.
   Results: Compared with the VMAT plans, the 4 pi plans yielded reduced
   50\% dose spillage volume and integral dose by 22\% (range 10\%-40\%)
   and 19\% (range 13\%-26\%), respectively. The mean normal liver volume
   receiving <15 Gy was increased by 51 cc (range 21-107 cc) with a 31\%
   reduction of the mean normal liver dose. Mean doses to the left kidney
   and right kidney and maximum doses to the stomach and spinal cord were
   on average reduced by 70\%, 51\%, 67\%, and 64\% (P <=.05).
   Conclusions: This novel 4p non-coplanar radiation delivery technique
   significantly improved dose gradient, reduced high dose spillage, and
   improved organ at risk sparing compared with state of the art VMAT
   plans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop an image analysis framework to delineate the
   physiological imaging-defined subvolumes of a tumor in relating to
   treatment response and outcome.
   Methods and Materials: Our proposed approach delineates the subvolumes
   of a tumor based on its heterogeneous distributions of physiological
   imaging parameters. The method assigns each voxel a probabilistic
   membership function belonging to the physiological parameter classes
   defined in a sample of tumors, and then calculates the related
   subvolumes in each tumor. We applied our approach to regional cerebral
   blood volume (rCBV) and Gd-DTPA transfer constant (K-trans) images of
   patients who had brain metastases and were treated by whole-brain
   radiation therapy (WBRT). A total of 45 lesions were included in the
   analysis. Changes in the rCBV (or K-trans)-defined subvolumes of the
   tumors from pre-RT to 2 weeks after the start of WBRT (2W) were
   evaluated for differentiation of responsive, stable, and progressive
   tumors using the Mann-Whitney U test. Performance of the newly developed
   metrics for predicting tumor response to WBRT was evaluated by receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
   Results: The percentage decrease in the high-CBV-defined subvolumes of
   the tumors from pre-RT to 2W was significantly greater in the group of
   responsive tumors than in the group of stable and progressive tumors
   (P<.007). The change in the high-CBV-defined subvolumes of the tumors
   from pre-RT to 2W was a predictor for post-RT response significantly
   better than change in the gross tumor volume observed during the same
   time interval (P=.012), suggesting that the physiological change occurs
   before the volumetric change. Also, K-trans did not add significant
   discriminatory information for assessing response with respect to rCBV.
   Conclusion: The physiological imaging-defined subvolumes of the tumors
   delineated by our method could be candidates for boost target, for which
   further development and evaluation is warranted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.}},

   2013. First published January 9, 2013;
   doi:10.1152/jn.01128.2011.-Locomotor adaptation in humans is not well
   understood. To provide insight into the neural reorganization that
   occurs following a significant disruption to one's learned neuromuscular
   map relating a given motor command to its resulting muscular action, we
   tied the mechanical action of a robotic exoskeleton to the
   electromyography (EMG) profile of the soleus muscle during walking. The
   powered exoskeleton produced an ankle dorsiflexion torque proportional
   to soleus muscle recruitment thus limiting the soleus' plantar flexion
   torque capability. We hypothesized that neurologically intact subjects
   would alter muscle activation patterns in response to the antagonistic
   exoskeleton by decreasing soleus recruitment. Subjects practiced walking
   with the exoskeleton for two 30-min sessions. The initial response to
   the perturbation was to ``fight{''} the resistive exoskeleton by
   increasing soleus activation. By the end of training, subjects had
   significantly reduced soleus recruitment resulting in a gait pattern
   with almost no ankle push-off. In addition, there was a trend for
   subjects to reduce gastrocnemius recruitment in proportion to the soleus
   even though only the soleus EMG was used to control the exoskeleton. The
   results from this study demonstrate the ability of the nervous system to
   recalibrate locomotor output in response to substantial changes in the
   mechanical output of the soleus muscle and associated sensory feedback.
   This study provides further evidence that the human locomotor system of
   intact individuals is highly flexible and able to adapt to achieve
   effective locomotion in response to a broad range of neuromuscular
   perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Nerve conduction studies provide information regarding the
   status of peripheral nerves, but relationships with sensorimotor
   capacities that influence mobility have not been defined. Methods: A
   secondary analysis was conducted on data from 41 older subjects (20
   women and 21 men, age 69.1 +/- 8.3 years), including 25 with diabetic
   neuropathy of varying severity and 16 without diabetes or neuropathy.
   Measurements included routine fibular motor nerve conduction studies and
   laboratory-based determination of ankle inversion/eversion
   proprioceptive thresholds and ankle inversion/eversion motor function.
   Results: Independent of age, fibular amplitude correlated robustly with
   ankle inversion/eversion proprioceptive thresholds (R2 = 0.591, P <
   0.001), moderately with ankle inversion and eversion rates of torque
   generation (R2 = 0.216; P = 0.004 and R2 = 0.200; P = 0.006,
   respectively), and more strongly when fibular motor amplitude was
   normalized for body mass index (R2 = 0.350; P < 0.001 and R2 = 0.275; P
   = 0.001). Conclusions: Fibular motor amplitude was strongly associated
   with ankle sensorimotor capacities that influence lateral balance and
   recovery from perturbations during gait. The results suggest that nerve
   conduction study measures have potential for an expanded clinical role
   in evaluating mobility function in the population studied. Muscle Nerve

Abstract = {{Free-flowing particles in a blood vessel were observed to be attracted,
   trapped and eroded by a histotripsy bubble cloud. This phenomenon may be
   used to develop a non-invasive embolus trap (NET) to prevent
   embolization. This study investigates the effect of acoustic parameters
   on the trapping ability of the NET generated by a focused 1.063 MHz
   transducer. The maximum trapping velocity, defined by the maximum mean
   fluid velocity at which a 3-4 mm particle trapped in a 6 mm diameter
   vessel phantom, increased linearly with peak negative pressure (P-) and
   increased as the square root of pulse length and pulse repetition
   frequency (PRF). At 19.9 MPa P-, 1000 Hz PRF and 10 cycle pulse length,

Abstract = {{Solving WPRTPs (wireless packet retransmission problems) using NC
   (network coding) is increasingly attracting research efforts. However,
   no work on NC based schemes for WPRTPs in MCNs (multiple channel
   networks) has been found. In this paper, RNC (random network coding)
   based schemes for P-WPRTPs (perfect WPRTPs) in MCNs, denoted as
   MC-P-WPRTPs (multiple channel perfect WPRTPs), are studied by
   transforming MC-P-WPRTPs into ILP (integer linear programming) problems.
   The ILP problems corresponding to MC-P-WPRTPs with four typical
   configurations are derived. Then the corresponding packet retransmission
   schedule schemes for MC-P-WPRTPs are proposed based on the solutions to
   the ILP problems and random network coding. To solve the ILP problems
   efficiently, an algorithm named as progressively fixing algorithm is
   proposed which recursively reduce the size of the ILP problem by fixing
   some of the variables according to some criteria. The criteria are
   related to the solution to the LP problem obtained by relaxing the
   integral constraints on the variables in the original ILP problem.
   Simulation results show that the NC based schemes for MC-P-WPRTPs are
   effective in saving packet retransmissions. In some situations, NC based
   schemes can save about 50 \% packet retransmissions.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication of oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) steels is a
   multi-stage process involving powder ball milling, degassing and
   consolidation by hot isostatic pressing. Y is introduced by mechanical
   alloying (MA) with either Y2O3 or Fe2Y so a high density of Y-Ti-O-based
   oxide nanoparticles is formed. The evolution of similar to 2 nm oxide
   nanoparticles and larger >5 nm grain boundary oxides has been studied at
   each step of the processing. The nanoparticle dispersions produced in
   material MA with Fe2Y were comparable to those produced by alloying with
   Y2O3. Hence the majority of oxygen which forms the nanoparticles must be
   incorporated from the atmosphere during MA, rather than being introduced
   via the alloying additions. During mechanical alloying, a high density
   of subnanometer particles are formed (2.5 +/- 0.5 x 10(24) m(-3)). The
   oxygen content of the nanoparticles decreases slightly on annealing, and
   then the composition of the nanoparticles remains constant throughout
   subsequent processing stages. The nanoparticle size increases during
   processing up to similar to 2 nm radius, while the number density
   decreases to 4 +/- 0.5 x 10(23) m(-3). Grain boundary oxides (>5 nm)
   have a Ti-Cr-O-rich shell, and contain no Y before consolidation, but
   have similar core composition to the matrix nanoparticles after
   consolidation. The formation of the larger grain boundary oxides is
   shown to take place during the degassing and consolidation stages, and
   this occurs at the expense of the nanoparticles in the matrix. This work
   provides a mechanistic understanding of the importance of controlling
   the oxygen content in the powder during MA, and the resulting impact on
   the formation of the ODS microstructure. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Introduction: Organ failure and tissue loss are challenging health
   issues due to widespread injury, the lack of organs for transplantation
   and limitations of conventional artificial implants. The field of tissue
   engineering aims to provide alternative living substitutes that restore,
   maintain or improve tissue function.
   Areas covered: In this paper, a wide range of porous scaffolds are
   reviewed, with an emphasis on phase-separation techniques that generate
   advantageous nanofibrous 3D scaffolds for stem cell-based tissue
   engineering applications. In addition, methods for presentation and
   delivery of bioactive molecules to mimic the properties of stem cell
   niches are summarized. Recent progress in using these bioinstructive
   scaffolds to support stem cell differentiation and tissue regeneration
   is also presented.
   Expert opinion: Stem cells have great clinical potential because of
   their capability to differentiate into multiple cell types. Biomaterials
   have served as artificial extracellular environments to regulate stem
   cell behavior. Biomaterials with various physical, mechanical and
   chemical properties can be designed to control stem cell development for
   regeneration.
   Conclusion: The research at the interface of stem cell biology and
   biomaterials has made and will continue to make exciting advances in
   tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), secondary users must be able to
   accurately and reliably track the location of small-scale mobile primary
   users/devices (e. g., wireless microphones) in order to efficiently
   utilize spatial spectrum opportunities, while protecting primary
   communications. However, accurate tracking of the location of mobile
   primary users is difficult due mainly to the CR-unique constraint, i.e.,
   localization must rely solely on reported sensing results (i.e.,
   measured primary signal strengths), which can easily be compromised by
   malicious sensors (or attackers). To cope with this challenge, we
   propose a new framework, called Sequential mOnte carLo combIned with
   shadow-faDing estimation (SOLID), for accurate, attack/fault-tolerant
   tracking of small-scale mobile primary users. The key idea underlying
   SOLID is to exploit the temporal shadow fading correlation in sensing
   results induced by the primary user's mobility. Specifically, SOLID
   augments conventional Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based target tracking
   with shadow-fading estimation. By examining the shadow-fading gain
   between the primary transmitter and CRs/sensors, SOLID 1) significantly
   improves the accuracy of primary tracking regardless of the
   presence/absence of attack, and 2) successfully masks the abnormal
   sensing reports due to sensor faults or attacks, preserving localization
   accuracy and improving spatial spectrum efficiency. Our extensive
   evaluation in realistic wireless fading environments shows that SOLID
   lowers localization error by up to 88 percent in the absence of attacks,
   and 89 percent in the presence of the challenging ``slow-poisoning{''}
   attack, compared to the conventional SMC-based tracking.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to construct an isogeometric analysis-suited geometry for
   isogeometric analysis, a new surface parameterization method using the
   one-step inverse forming (SPIA) is proposed. Initial generation of
   watertight analysis-suitable geometry (NURBS surfaces) with complex
   shapes can be a significant bottleneck for isogeometric analysis because
   computer-aided design models often include ambiguities such as gaps and
   overlaps. Most of traditional surface parameterization techniques are
   based on geometric method and limited to finite meshes, while SPIA is a
   physics-based method using sheet metal forming technique with large
   elastic-plastic deformation and robust enough and rapid to deal with the
   finite elements mesh with over 100,000 nodes within 2 min without the
   necessity to simplify the meshes. Using Coons surface parameterization,
   global mesh parameterization, and NURBS reconstruction, we can rebuild
   new computer-aided design models with errors under any tolerance to
   which isogeometric analysis can be applied. The NURBS surfaces after
   reconstruction are also used for computer-aided manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Construction operations generate significant air pollutant emissions,
   including carbon emissions and diesel exhaust emissions. Controlling
   operational efficiency is the most important strategy for reducing air
   pollutants emitted from construction operations. However, current
   practices to assess air pollutant emissions from construction operations
   tend to ignore the variability of the operational efficiency that
   results from different resource allotting and scheduling. In this
   context, this paper presents a methodology for incorporating the
   analysis of operational efficiency into quantifying the amount of
   exhaust emission from construction operations. Case studies are
   presented to examine how and to what extent planning decisions affect
   the amount of air pollutants emitted from construction operations and to
   identify the impact that possible alternatives have on the schedule and
   cost of projects. The findings of case studies indicate that considering
   environmental aspects in the planning stage could contribute to a
   project's increased integrated value, which includes schedule, cost, and
   environmental impact. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000609. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We apply an interpolation-based edge-tracking algorithm to measure
   nanoscale displacements of microdevices, and further enhance its ability
   to reject noisy signals using averaging of multiple image frames. We
   present a simulation of a moving edge, and use this simulation to
   explore the performance of the algorithm as related to the image
   acquisition and process parameters. Then, we present the application of
   this technique to two experiments. First, we demonstrate optical
   measurement of the motion of a compliant mechanism, and smoothly detect
   lateral step motion change as small as 30.8 nm s(-1). Second, we measure
   the anisotropic nanoscale expansion of a liquid crystal network
   micropillar, which occurs slowly over several minutes. This efficient
   algorithm can smoothly track motions as small as a few per cent of a
   pixel, which is equivalent to tens of nanometers using images from a
   video camera attached to a conventional optical microscope. Therefore,
   this technique can be widely applied to characterization of nanoscale
   motions using conventional optics, without requiring special features on
   the device to enable imaging.}},

Title = {{Simulations and measurements of in-mold melt flow during the injection

Journal = {{POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{53}},

Pages = {{770-779}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Simulations are often used to model polymer flow during injection
   molding to design molds and select processing parameters. It is
   difficult to determine the accuracy of these simulations due to a lack
   of experimentally measured in-mold velocimetry and melt-front
   progression data. This article compares the results from commercial
   mold-filling simulation software to experimental data obtained via
   particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a special optical-access mold with a
   rectangular cavity. Moldflow was used to simulate the mold filling by a
   polystyrene melt in the experimental configuration, and these simulated
   results are compared to the appropriately averaged time-varying velocity
   field measurements. Simulated results for melt-front progression are
   also compared with experimentally observed flow fronts. The ratio of the
   experimentally measured average velocity magnitudes to the simulation
   magnitudes was found on average to be 0.99 with a standard deviation of
   0.25, and the difference in velocity orientations was found to be 0.9
   degrees with a standard deviation of 3.2 degrees. The corner area
   opposite the gate was most problematic for the simulation. The region
   behind the front also had a relatively high simulation error, though not
   as severe as that in the corner. POLYM. ENG. SCI. 2013. (c) 2012 Society

Abstract = {{Biofilms production is a central feature of nosocomial infection of
   catheters and other medical devices used in resuscitation and critical
   care. However, the very effective biofilm forming pathogen
   Staphylococcus epidermidis often produces a modest host inflammatory
   response and few of the signs and symptoms associated with more virulent
   pathogens. To examine the impact of bacterial biofilm formation on
   provocation of an innate immune response, we studied the elaboration of
   the major complement anaphylatoxin C5a by human serum upon contact with
   S. epidermidis biofilms. Wildtype S. epidermidis and mutants of sarA (a
   regulatory protein that promotes synthesis of the biofilm-forming
   polysaccharide intercellular adhesin {[}PIA]) and icaB (responsible for
   postexport processing of PIA) were studied. C5a release, as a function
   of exposed biofilm surface area, was on the order of 1 fmol.cm(-2).s(-1)
   and was dependent on the presence of PIA. Experimental results were used
   to inform a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of C5a release
   by an infected central venous catheter, one of S. epidermidis' primary
   means of causing human disease. These simulations revealed that the
   magnitude of C5a release on a superior vena cava catheter completely
   covered with S. epidermidis would be lower than necessary to alert
   circulating leukocytes. Combined, the experimental and computational
   results are highly consistent with clinical observations in which the
   clinical signs of central line-associated bloodstream infection are
   often muted in association with this important pathogen.}},

Title = {{Lamb wave damage detection using time reversal DORT method}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Among structural health monitoring methods, Lamb waves are frequently
   used as a diagnostic tool to detect damage in plate-like structures. The
   decomposition of the time reversal operator (DORT) method is a selective
   detection and focusing technique using an array of transmit-receive
   transducers. Unlike body waves, the propagation of Lamb waves is
   complicated due to their dispersive and multimode characteristics. So it
   is hard to locate different scatterers on the plate directly using the
   DORT method because of the asymmetry of the time reversal transfer
   matrix. In the present paper a damage detection technique to make the
   transfer matrix symmetric for the Lamb wave DORT method is proposed. It
   is found that the number of significant eigenvalues is not exactly equal
   to the number of damage targets and two significant eigenvalues are
   associated with one damage target. An experiment is carried out to
   distinguish and locate two simulated points of damage on an aluminum
   plate. The behavior of reflected multimode waves is analyzed by studying
   the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the time reversal operator matrix.
   This method, which uses a PZT array and operates under multimode
   pulse-echo mode, can estimate the position of the damage zone in the 2D
   image by numerically backpropagating a selective eigenvector using the
   A(0) and/or S-0 Lamb wave propagation analytical solution. The
   experimental results illustrate the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{The process of using the atomic force microscopy to characterize the

   Pipkin-Rogers non-linear single integral constitutive equation is used
   to model the membrane material. This includes Quasi-Linear

   viscoelastic properties on the response is investigated. It is shown
   that, in a step deformation experiment, time dependence of the
   deformation indicates that the material should not be modeled using QLV.

Abstract = {{The steady-state simplified P-N (SPN) approximations to the linear
   Boltzmann equation have been proven to be asymptotically higher-order
   corrections to the diffusion equation in certain physical systems. In
   this paper, we present an asymptotic analysis for the time-dependent
   simplified P-N equations up to N = 3. Additionally, SPN equations of
   arbitrary order are derived in an ad hoc way. The resulting SPN
   equations are hyperbolic and differ from those investigated in a
   previous work by some of the authors. In two space dimensions, numerical
   calculations for the P-N and SPN equations are performed. We simulate
   neutron distributions of a moving rod and present results for a
   benchmark problem, known as the checkerboard problem. The SPN equations

Abstract = {{Computationally efficient numerical models of battery cooling systems
   are developed and the effects of the battery cell arrangement and the
   heat transfer fluid (HTF) type on the cooling performance and the
   parasitic power consumption of the system are investigated. A
   one-dimensional heat conduction model of a cylindrical battery cell is
   developed using a finite difference method for the cell temperature
   prediction and a battery module model is developed to predict the cell
   to cell temperature variation and the power consumption of the systems
   depending on the design of battery module and operating conditions. The
   analysis of the battery thermal management system (BTMS) design by using
   the numerical model is conducted for air and liquid type BTMSs. From the
   numerical analysis, it is found that a wide battery module with a small
   cell to cell gap is desirable for the air type BTMS while a narrow
   battery module with a small gap is desirable for a liquid type BTMS. The
   results also show that the air type BTMS consumes much more power
   compared with the liquid type BTMS especially for high heat load
   condition. However, under low heat load conditions, the power
   consumption of the air type BTMS is acceptable considering its
   advantages over the liquid type BTMS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{85-92}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The interaction between fiber kink banding and splitting in the
   compressive response of fiber composites is investigated by adopting a
   micromechanics based 2D finite element representation of the composite.
   The effect of scaling of the computational model (size of model) on the
   compressive strength and post critical response is also studied. The
   size of the computational model is scaled in a systematic manner by
   increasing the number of fibers in the model, but maintaining a fixed
   aspect ratio and fiber volume fraction. The response of the model
   changes with change in model size, and therefore, a converged model size
   (baseline) for predicting compressive strength is first established.
   Since the strains experienced within the kink band are very large, the
   baseline model is extended to account for splitting as a potential mode
   of failure by adopting a discrete cohesive zone model. A parametric
   study is carried out to investigate the interaction between kinking and
   splitting in limiting the compressive strength of the composite. (c)

Abstract = {{In this paper we study a class of selective newsvendor problems, where a
   decision maker has a set of raw materials each of which can be
   customized shortly before satisfying demand. The goal is then to select
   which subset of customizations maximizes expected profit. We show that
   certain multi-period and multi-product selective newsvendor problems
   fall within our problem class. Under the assumption that the demands are
   independent and normally, but not necessarily identically, distributed
   we show that some problem instances from our class can be solved
   efficiently using an attractive sorting property that was also
   established in the literature for some related problems. For our general
   model we use the KKT conditions to develop an exact algorithm that is
   efficient in the number of raw materials. In addition, we develop a
   class of heuristic algorithms. In a numerical study, we compare the
   performance of the algorithms, and the heuristics are shown to have
   excellent performance and running times as compared to available
   commercial solvers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is essential for cell migration and plays an
   important role in tumor metastasis. However, the complex intermolecular
   and intramolecular interactions that regulate FAK activity at the focal
   adhesion remain unresolved. We have engineered a toolbox of FRET sensors
   that retain all of the individual FAK domains but modulate a key
   intramolecular regulatory interaction between the band
   4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) and kinase domains of FAK. We
   demonstrate systematic control and quantitative measurement of the
   FERM-kinase interaction at focal adhesions, which in turn allows us to
   control cell migration. Using these sensors, we find that Tyr-397
   phosphorylation, rather than kinase activity of FAK, is the key
   determinant of cell migration. Our sensors directly demonstrate, for the
   first time, a pH-dependent change in a protein-protein interaction at a
   macromolecular structure in live cells. The FERM-kinase interaction at
   focal adhesions is enhanced at acidic pH, with a concomitant decrease in
   Tyr-397 phosphorylation, providing a potential mechanism for enhanced
   migration of cancer cells.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},

Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Glassy polymers show ``strain hardening{''}: at constant extensional
   load, their flow first accelerates, then arrests. Recent experiments
   under such loading have found this to be accompanied by a striking dip
   in the segmental relaxation time. This can be explained by a minimal
   nonfactorable model combining flow-induced melting of a glass with the
   buildup of stress carried by strained polymers. Within this model,
   liquefaction of segmental motion permits strong flow that creates
   polymer-borne stress, slowing the deformation enough for the segmental
   (or solvent) modes then to re-vitrify. Here, we present new results for
   the corresponding behavior under step-stress shear loading, to which
   very similar physics applies. To explain the unloading behavior in the
   extensional case requires introduction of a ``crinkle factor{''}
   describing a rapid loss of segmental ordering. We discuss in more detail
   here the physics of this, which we argue involves non-entropic
   contributions to the polymer stress, and which might lead to some
   important differences between shear and elongation. We also discuss some
   fundamental and possibly testable issues concerning the physical meaning
   of entropic elasticity in vitrified polymers. Finally, we present new
   results for the startup of steady shear flow, addressing the possible
   role of transient shear banding. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Inorganic coatings for optimized non-viral transfection of stem cells}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{``Biomimetic{''} approaches for heterogeneous growth of inorganic
   coatings have become particularly widespread in biomedical applications,
   where calcium phosphate (CaP) mineral coatings are used to improve
   biomedical implants. Changes in coating properties can influence the
   effects of mineral coatings on adjacent cells, but to date it has not
   been practical to systematically vary inorganic coating properties to
   optimize specific cell behaviors. Here, we present an approach to grow
   CaP mineral coatings in an enhanced throughput format to identify
   unprecedented capabilities in non-viral gene delivery. Subtle changes in
   coating properties resulted in widely variable transfection, and
   optimized coatings led to greater than 10-fold increases in transgene
   expression by multiple target cell types when compared to standard
   techniques. The enhanced transfection observed here is
   substrate-mediated, and related to the characteristics of the local
   environment near the surface of dissolving mineral coatings. These
   findings may be particularly translatable to medical device
   applications.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{In atmospheric pressure discharges, such as dielectric barrier
   discharges (DBDs), it is common to have transient sheaths having
   electric fields of hundreds of kV cm(-1). With these sheaths, even with
   short mean free paths, it may be possible to deliver short pulses of
   energetic ions (tens to hundreds of eV) to surfaces. The energies of
   these ions can be controlled to some extent by selecting the relative
   permittivity (epsilon/epsilon(0)) of the underlying surface. In using
   DBDs to treat sensitive materials or tissue in plasma medicine where
   control of ion energies may be desirable, one has a very limited
   ability, if any, to modify the dielectric properties of the tissue. In
   this paper, we use results from a computational study to propose a
   method to control the characteristics of the transient sheath formed at
   the surface of sensitive materials or biological tissue by using a thin
   porous film placed on top of the surface. By controlling the transient
   sheath, one can control the ion energies delivered to the surface. We
   show that ion energies delivered to the underlying surface through the
   pores can be controlled by the capacitance and thickness of the film and
   the width of the pore. Results are discussed for streamer penetration
   and ion energies delivered to the surface when the plasma filament
   directly strikes the pore and is offset from the pore.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss a novel mechanism to set up a gravity dual of FFLO states in
   strongly coupled superconductors. The gravitational theory utilizes two
   U(1) gauge fields and a scalar field coupled to a charged AdS black
   hole. The first gauge field couples with the scalar sourcing a charge
   condensate below a critical temperature, and the second gauge field
   provides a coupling to spin in the boundary theory. The scalar is
   neutral under the second gauge field. By turning on an interaction
   between the Einstein tensor and the scalar, it is shown that, in the low
   temperature limit, an inhomogeneous solution possesses a higher critical
   temperature than the homogeneous case, giving rise to FFLO states. (c)

Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Particle-induced electron emission (PIE) is modeled in a simplified,
   well-characterized plasma Test Cell operated at UCLA. In order for PIE
   to be a useful model in this environment, its governing equations are
   first reduced to lower-order models which can be implemented in a direct
   simulation Monte Carlo and Particle-in-Cell framework. These
   reduced-order models are described in full and presented as
   semi-empirical models. The models are implemented to analyze the
   interaction of low-and high-energy ( 1-2 keV) xenon ions and atoms with
   the stainless steel electrodes of the Test Cell in order to gain insight
   into the emission and transport of secondary electrons. Furthermore,
   there is a lack of data for xenon-stainless steel atom-and ion-surface
   interactions for similar environments. Using experimental data as a
   reference, both total yields and emitted electron energy distribution
   functions can be deduced by observing sensitivities of current
   collection results to these numerical models and their parameters. (C)

   Dorsal Cochlear Nucleus}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Multisensory neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) show
   long-lasting enhancement or suppression of sound-evoked responses when
   stimulated with combined somatosensory-auditory stimulation. By varying
   the intervals between sound and somatosensory stimuli we show for the
   first time in vivo that DCN bimodal responses are influenced by
   stimulus-timing dependent plasticity. The timing rules and time courses
   of the observed stimulus-timing dependent plasticity closely mimic those
   of spike-timing dependent plasticity that have been demonstrated in
   vitro at parallel-fiber synapses onto DCN principal cells. Furthermore,
   the degree of inhibition in a neuron influences whether that neuron has
   Hebbian or anti-Hebbian timing rules. As demonstrated in other
   cerebellar-like circuits, anti-Hebbian timing rules reflect adaptive
   filtering, which in the DCN would result in suppression of sound-evoked
   responses that are predicted by activation of somatosensory inputs,
   leading to the suppression of body-generated signals such as
   self-vocalization.}},

Title = {{From Design to Screening: A New Antimicrobial Peptide Discovery Pipeline}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) belong to a class of natural microbicidal
   molecules that have been receiving great attention for their lower
   propensity for inducing drug resistance, hence, their potential as
   alternative drugs to conventional antibiotics. By generating AMP
   libraries, one can study a large number of candidates for their
   activities simultaneously in a timely manner. Here, we describe a novel
   methodology where in silico designed AMP-encoding oligonucleotide
   libraries are cloned and expressed in a cellular host for rapid
   screening of active molecules. The combination of parallel
   oligonucleotide synthesis with microbial expression systems not only
   offers complete flexibility for sequence design but also allows for
   economical construction of very large peptide libraries. An application
   of this approach to discovery of novel AMPs has been demonstrated by
   constructing and screening a custom library of twelve thousand
   plantaricin-423 mutants in Escherichia coli. Analysis of selected clones
   by both Sanger-sequencing and 454 high-throughput sequencing produced a
   significant amount of data for positionally important residues of
   plantaricin-423 responsible for antimicrobial activity and, moreover,
   resulted in identification of many novel variants with enhanced specific
   activities against Listeria innocua. This approach allows for generation
   of fully tailored peptide collections in a very cost effective way and
   will have countless applications from discovery of novel AMPs to gaining
   fundamental understanding of their biological function and
   characteristics.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1903-1912}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{In the commonly used nucleation-dependent model of protein aggregation,
   aggregation proceeds only after a lag phase in which the concentration
   of energetically unfavorable nuclei reaches a critical value. The
   formation of oligomeric species prior to aggregation can be difficult to
   detect by current spectroscopic techniques. By using real-time F-19 NMR
   along with other techniques, we are able to show that multiple
   oligomeric species can be detected during the lag phase of A beta(1-40)
   fiber formation, consistent with a complex mechanism of aggregation. At
   least six types of oligomers can be detected by F-19 NMR. These include
   the reversible formation of large beta-sheet oligomer immediately after
   solubilization at high peptide concentration, a small oligomer that
   forms transiently during the early stages of the lag phase, and four
   spectroscopically distinct forms of oligomers with molecular weights
   between similar to 30 and 100 kDa that appear during the later stages of
   aggregation. The ability to resolve individual oligomers and track their

Abstract = {{The metal-organic framework Zn4O (BDC)(3) (BDC = 1,4-bezene
   dicarboxlate), also known as MOF-5, has demonstrated considerable
   adsorption of hydrogen, up to 7 excess wt.\% at 77 K. Consequently, it
   has attracted significant attention for vehicular hydrogen storage
   applications. To improve the volumetric hydrogen density and thermal
   conductivity of MOF-5, prior studies have examined the hydrogen storage
   capacities of dense MOF-5 pellets and the impact of thermally conductive
   additives such as expanded natural graphite (ENG). However, the
   performance of a storage system based on densified MOF-5 powders will
   also hinge upon the rate of hydrogen mass transport through the storage
   medium. In this study, we further characterize MOF-5 compacts by
   measuring their hydrogen transport properties as a function of pellet
   density (rho = 0.3-0.5 g cm(-3)) and the presence/absence of ENG
   additions. More specifically, the Darcy permeability and diffusivity of
   hydrogen in pellets of neat MOF-5, and composite pellets consisting of
   MOF-5 with 5 and 10 wt.\% ENG additions, have been measured at ambient
   (296 K) and liquid nitrogen (77 K) temperatures. The experimental data
   suggest that the H-2 transport in densified MOF-5 is strongly related to
   the MOP-5 pellet density rho. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1655-1665}},

Abstract = {{A bench-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) equipped with
   submerged flat-sheet microfiltration membranes was operated at
   psychrophilic temperature (15 degrees C) treating simulated and actual
   domestic wastewater (DWW). Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal during
   simulated DWW operation averaged 92 +/- 5\% corresponding to an average
   permeate COD of 36 +/- 21 mg/L. Dissolved methane in the permeate stream
   represented a substantial fraction (40-50\%) of the total methane
   generated by the system due to methane solubility at psychrophilic
   temperatures and oversaturation relative to Henry's law. During actual
   DWW operation, COD removal averaged 69 +/- 10\%. The permeate COD and
   5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) averaged 76 +/- 10 mg/L and 24
   +/- 3 mg/L, respectively, indicating compliance with the U.S. EPA's
   standard for secondary effluent (30 mg/L BOD5). Membrane fouling was
   managed using biogas sparging and permeate backflushing and a flux
   greater than 7 LMH was maintained for 30 days. Comparative fouling
   experiments suggested that the combination of the two fouling control
   measures was more effective than either fouling prevention method alone.
   A UniFrac based comparison of bacterial and archaeal microbial
   communities in the AnMBR and three different inocula using
   pyrosequencing targeting 16S rRNA genes suggested that mesophilic
   inocula are suitable for seeding psychrophilic AnMBRs treating low
   strength wastewater. Overall, the research described relatively stable
   COD removal, acceptable flux, and the ability to seed a psychrophilic
   AnMBR with mesophilic inocula, indicating future potential for the
   technology in practice, Particularly in cold and temperate climates
   where DWW temperatures are low during part of the year. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We investigate the self-assembly of crystals from reconfigurable

   ability, inspired by recent experiments, to continuously alter their
   shape before, during, and after assembly. Using molecular simulations,
   we report the assembly of a reconfigurable degenerate crystal containing
   a fractionally filled kagome sublattice. We showthat this degenerate
   crystal differs from, and assembles more easily than, its counterpart
   known for rigid dimers. We further report that the reconfigurable
   crystal has unique mechanical properties under shear strain compared to
   a crystal comprised of rigid building blocks. We find that even a small
   amount of reconfigurability in an assembly of otherwise rigid building
   blocks can greatly affect mechanical properties. DOI:

Abstract = {{Polymeric synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides (SMAMPs) have
   recently demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity as natural
   antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from innate immunity. This is surprising,
   since polymeric SMAMPs are heterogeneous in terms of chemical structure
   (random sequence) and conformation (random coil), in contrast to defined
   amino acid sequence and intrinsic secondary structure. To understand
   this better, we compare AMPs with a ``minimal{''} mimic, a
   well-characterized family of polydisperse cationic methacrylate-based
   random copolymer SMAMPs. Specifically, we focus on a comparison between
   the quantifiable membrane curvature generating capacity, charge density,
   and hydrophobicity of the polymeric SMAMPs and AMPs. Synchrotron
   small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) results indicate that typical AMPs
   and these methacrylate SMAMPs generate similar amounts of membrane
   negative Gaussian curvature (NGC), which is topologically necessary for
   a variety of membrane-destabilizing processes. Moreover, the curvature
   generating ability of SMAMPs is more tolerant of changes in the lipid
   composition than that of natural AMPs with similar chemical groups,
   consistent with the lower specificity of SMAMPs. We find that, although
   the amount of NGC generated by these SMAMPs and AMPs are similar, the
   SMAMPs require significantly higher levels of hydrophobicity and
   cationic charge to achieve the same level of membrane deformation. We
   propose an explanation for these differences, which has implications for
   new synthetic strategies aimed at improved mimesis of AMPs.}},

Abstract = {{Anomalous, vacancy-induced anisotropic thermal conductivity is one of
   the important properties in the recently discovered high-ZT In4Se3-x
   compound. In this work, the lattice thermal conductivity of In4Se3-x is
   investigated using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation, the
   point-defect model, and ab initio calculations. The charge density
   distribution shows highly anisotropic structure with strong bonding
   along In-Se-In chain direction. Se vacancy strongly suppresses the
   phonon propagation along the chain direction, with little change in
   other directions. We show that suppressed long-range acoustic phonon
   transport caused by the vacancy results in anisotropic change of lattice
   conductivity. We suggest controlling of vacancy in intrinsic
   low-dimensional compounds is critical in achieving optimal lattice
   thermal conductivity and other thermoelectric properties. DOI:

Abstract = {{Among all carbon nanostructured materials, helical nanosprings or
   nanocoils have attracted particular interest as a result of their
   special mechanical behavior. Here, carbon nanosprings are used to adjust
   the viscoelasticity and reduce the resulting hysteresis loss (HL) of
   elastomeric polymer materials. Two types of nanospring-filled elastomer
   composites are constructed as follows: system I is obtained by directly
   blending polymer chains with nanosprings; system II is composed of the
   self-assembly of a tri-block structure such as chain-nanospring-chain.
   Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that the
   incorporation of nanosprings can improve the mechanical strength of the
   elastomer matrix through nanoreinforcement and considerably decrease the
   hysteresis loss. This finding is significant for reducing fuel
   consumption and improving fuel efficiency in the automobile tire
   industry. Furthermore, it is revealed that the spring constant of
   nanosprings and the interfacial chemical coupling between chains and
   nanosprings both play crucial roles in adjusting the viscoelasticity of
   elastomers. It is inferred that elastomer/carbon nanostructured
   materials with good flexibility and reversible mechanical response
   (carbon nanosprings, nanocoils, nanorings, and thin graphene sheets)
   have both excellent mechanical and low HL properties; this may open a
   new avenue for fabrication of high performance automobile tires and
   facilitate the large-scale industrial application of these materials.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the essential components in electrodes, the binder affects the
   performance of a rechargeable battery. By modifying -cyclodextrin (-CD),
   an appropriate binder for sulfur composite cathodes is identified.
   Through a partial oxidation reaction in H2O2 solution, -CD is
   successfully modified to carbonyl--cyclodextrin (C--CD), which exhibits
   a water solubility ca. 100 times that of -CD at room temperature. C--CD
   possesses the typical properties of an aqueous binder: strong bonding
   strength, high solubility in water, moderate viscosity, and wide
   electrochemical windows. Sulfur composite cathodes with C--CD as the
   binder demonstrate a high reversible capacity of 694.2 mA h
   g(composite)1 and 1542.7 mA h g(sulfur)1, with a sulfur utilization
   approaching 92.2\%. The discharge capacity remains at 1456 mA h
   g(sulfur)1 after 50 cycles, which is much higher than that of the
   cathode with unmodified -CD as binder. Combined with its low cost and
   environmental benignity, C--CD is a promising binder for sulfur cathodes
   in rechargeable lithium batteries with high electrochemical performance.}},

Abstract = {{Spina bifida (SB) patients afflicted with myelomeningocele typically
   possess a neurogenic urinary bladder and exhibit varying degrees of
   bladder dysfunction. Although surgical intervention in the form of
   enterocystoplasty is the current standard of care in which to remedy the
   neurogenic bladder, it is still a stop-gap measure and is associated
   with many complications due to the use of bowel as a source of
   replacement tissue. Contemporary bladder tissue engineering strategies
   lack the ability to reform bladder smooth muscle, vasculature, and
   promote peripheral nerve tissue growth when using autologous populations
   of cells. Within the context of this study, we demonstrate the role of
   two specific populations of bone marrow (BM) stem/progenitor cells used
   in combination with a synthetic elastomeric scaffold that provides a
   unique and alternative means to current bladder regeneration approaches.
   In vitro differentiation, gene expression, and proliferation are similar
   among donor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), whereas
   poly(1,8-octanediol-cocitrate) scaffolds seeded with SB BM MSCs perform
   analogously to control counterparts with regard to bladder smooth muscle
   wall formation in vivo. SB CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
   cotransplanted with donor-matched MSCs cause a dramatic increase in
   tissue vascularization as well as an induction of peripheral nerve
   growth in grafted areas compared with samples not seeded with
   hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Finally, MSC/CD34(+) grafts
   provided the impetus for rapid urothelium regeneration. Data suggest
   that autologous BM stem/progenitor cells may be used as alternate,
   nonpathogenic cell sources for SB patient-specific bladder tissue
   regeneration in lieu of current enterocystoplasty procedures and have
   implications for other bladder regenerative therapies.}},

Title = {{Regional Variation in Brain White Matter Diffusion Index Changes
   following Chemoradiotherapy: A Prospective Study Using Tract-Based
   Spatial Statistics}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: There is little known about how brain white matter structures
   differ in their response to radiation, which may have implications for
   radiation-induced neurocognitive impairment. We used diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) to examine regional variation in white matter changes
   following chemoradiotherapy.
   Methods: Fourteen patients receiving two or three weeks of whole-brain
   radiation therapy (RT) +/- chemotherapy underwent DTI pre-RT, at end-RT,
   and one month post-RT. Three diffusion indices were measured: fractional
   anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). We
   determined significant individual voxel changes of diffusion indices
   using tract-based spatial statistics, and mean changes of the indices
   within fourteen white matter structures of interest.
   Results: Voxels of significant FA decreases and RD increases were seen
   in all structures (p<0.05), with the largest changes (20-50\%) in the
   fornix, cingula, and corpus callosum. There were highly significant
   between-structure differences in pre-RT to end-RT mean FA changes
   (p<0.001). The inferior cingula had a mean FA decrease from pre-RT to
   end-RT significantly greater than 11 of the 13 other structures
   (p<0.00385).
   Conclusions: Brain white matter structures varied greatly in their
   response to chemoradiotherapy as measured by DTI changes. Changes in FA
   and RD related to white matter demyelination were prominent in the
   cingula and fornix, structures relevant to radiation-induced
   neurocognitive impairment. Future research should evaluate DTI as a
   predictive biomarker of brain chemoradiotherapy adverse effects.}},

   surface evidence of liquefaction was observed and 16 SMS underlain by
   geologically recent sediments or fills where surface evidence of
   liquefaction was not observed. Pre-earthquake standard penetration test
   data and borehole shear wave velocity (V-s) profiles are available for
   some stations, but critical information, such as grain size distribution
   and fines plasticity, are often lacking. In the heavily damaged city of
   Urayasu, we performed post-earthquake cone penetration testing at seven

Abstract = {{Crude bio-oil produced from hydrothermal liquefaction of Nannochloropsis
   sp was reacted over HZSM-5 catalyst with high pressure H-2. The effects
   of reaction temperature (400-500 degrees C), reaction time (0.5-4 h),
   and catalyst loading (5-50 wt.\%) on the composition and yields of the
   oil and gas products were determined. Treatment greatly reduced the
   heteroatom (N, O, and S) content in the oil. S was reduced to below
   detection limits (<0.1 wt.\%) at all reaction conditions investigated.
   The lowest N/C ratio achieved is about 25\% of the original N/C ratio in
   the crude bio-oil. The O/C ratio of the oil treated at 450 and 500
   degrees C was an order of magnitude lower than that in the crude
   bio-oil. The carbon content of the oil increased at all reaction
   conditions investigated, but the H/C ratios of the oils treated at 450
   and 500 degrees C fell below that of the crude bio-oil due to their high
   aromatic content and the migration of H atoms into the gaseous products.
   This study demonstrates the opportunities to engineer the composition of
   the products that emerge from this catalytic treatment of the crude
   bio-oil. Catalytic processing at 400 degrees C produced a paraffinic oil
   that was 95 wt.\% C and H and retained 87\% of the energy content of the
   crude bio-oil. This product would be useful as a feedstock for liquid
   transportation fuels. Catalytic processing at 500 degrees C, on the
   other hand, produced a freely flowing liquid mixture composed of
   aromatic hydrocarbons in 44 wt.\% yield along with a hydrocarbon gas
   stream in 19 wt.\% yield. These products, which could be useful as
   feedstocks for industrial chemicals, contained 70\% of the carbon
   originally present in the crude bio-oil. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, analytical solutions are derived for the case when an
   elastic water-backed plate (WBP) is subject to an exponential shock
   loading near a fixed solid boundary. Two cases, a rigid plate and an
   elastic plate represented by two mass elements connected by a spring and
   a dashpot, are studied. The analytical solution is extended from
   Taylor's (1963, ``The Pressure and Impulse of Submarine Explosion Waves
   on Plates,{''} Scientific Papers of Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor, Vol. 3,
   G. K. Batchelor, ed., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, pp.
   287-303) floating air-backed plate (ABP) model and the water-backed
   plate model of Liu and Young (2008, `` Transient Response of Submerged
   Plates Subject to Underwater Shock Loading: An Analytical
   Perspective,{''} J. Appl. Mech., 75(4), 044504; 2010, `` Shock-Structure
   Interaction Considering Pressure Precursor,{''} Proceedings of the 28th
   Symposium on Naval Hydrodynamics, Pasadena, CA). The influences of five
   parameters are studied: (a) the distance of the fixed boundary from the
   back plate d, (b) the fluid structure interaction (FSI) parameter phi of
   the plate, (c) the stiffness of the plate as represented by the natural
   frequency of the system T, (d) the material damping coefficient C-D of
   the plate, and (e) the pressure precursor (rise) time theta(r). The
   results show that the pressure responses at the front and back surfaces
   of the plate are greatly affected by the proximity to the fixed
   boundary, the fluid-structure interaction parameter, the ratio of the
   shock decay time to the natural period of the structure, and the rise
   time of incident pressure. The effect of structural damping (assuming a
   typical material damping coefficient of 5\%) is found to be practically
   negligible compared to the other four parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Renal disease is epidemic in the United States with approximately 8 x
   10(6) people having chronic kidney disease. Renal biopsies are widely
   used to provide essential diagnostic information to physicians. However,
   the risk of bleeding complications possibly leading to lifethreatening
   situations results in the contra-indication of biopsy in certain patient
   populations. Safer renal biopsies will allow more accurate diagnosis and
   better management of this epidemic health problem. We report the
   preclinical testing of a novel biopsy device called the therapeutic
   injection system (TIS). The device introduces a third stage to the
   standard two-stage side-cut percutaneous biopsy process. The third stage
   is designed to reduce bleeding complications by injecting a hemostatic
   plug at the time of biopsy. Laboratory evaluation and preliminary in
   vivo animal testing using an anticoagulated porcine model of the TIS and
   Bard Monopty (R) (Bard Medical, Covington, GA) control device were
   performed. The hemostatic material Gelfoam (R) (Pfizer, Brussels,
   Belgium) was selected as the active material comprising the hemostatic
   plugs. The performance of two composite plugs, one composed of polyvinyl
   alcohol (PVA) combined in 2: 1 and 12: 1 ratios with the hemostatic
   material, and one plug composed of 100\% hemostatic material were
   tested. Stroke sequence and hemostatic plug deployment were verified by
   sequential firing of the TIS biopsy needle into clear gelatin and ex
   vivo bovine kidney specimens. In vivo trials with porcine specimens
   revealed a significant reduction in blood loss (8.1 +/- 3.9 ml, control
   versus 1.9 +/- 1.6 ml, 12: 1 PVA/hemostatic, TIS, alpha = 0.01, n = 6).
   The 100\% hemostatic plug showed a substantial and immediate reduction
   in blood loss (9.2 ml, control versus 0.0 ml, TIS, n = 1). The prototype
   device was shown to work repeatedly and reliably in laboratory trials.
   Initial results show promise in this approach to control post biopsy
   bleeding. This solution maintains the simplicity and directness of the
   percutaneous approach, while not significantly changing the standard
   percutaneous biopsy procedure.}},

Title = {{Control of Engine-Starts for Optimal Drivability of Parallel Hybrid

   ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The pretransmission parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with a single
   electric motor requires relatively little changes from existing
   powertrain configurations. This configuration, however, has a
   challenging drivability issue during engine-starts because the electric
   motor must simultaneously provide the demanded propulsion torque and
   start the engine. Depending on the propulsion power level, such
   engine-start process may require a trade-off between drivability and
   quick start. The goal of this study is to find theoretical performance
   limits and corresponding optimal control strategies that achieve the
   balance between these two conflicting goals. We first develop a
   simplified parallel HEV powertrain model to predict the engine, clutch,
   and vehicle dynamics. Assuming that the clutch torque can be accurately
   estimated and perfectly cancelled, an optimal engine-start control
   problem is formulated to minimize engine-start time while supplying the
   driver demanded torque. This nonlinear constrained optimal control
   problem is solved both analytically and numerically. For some special
   cases, the optimization problem can be solved analytically to obtain a
   closed-form solution. For the numerical method, dynamic programming (DP)
   is used, and both analytical and numerical solutions show that selecting
   a proper level of constant clutch pressure is the key to achieve
   near-optimal drivability performance. Furthermore, the DP control policy
   is found to be time-invariant, and thus can be implemented in the form
   of a full state feedback controller.}},

Abstract = {{An energy management controller based on shortest path stochastic
   dynamic programming (SP-SDP) is implemented and tested in a prototype
   vehicle. The controller simultaneously optimizes fuel economy and
   powertrain activity, namely gear shifts and engine on-off events.
   Previous work reported on the controller's design and its extensive
   simulation based evaluation. This paper focuses on implementation of the
   controller algorithm in hardware. Practical issues concerning real-time
   computability, driver perception, and command timing are highlighted and
   addressed. The SP-SDP controllers are shown to run in real-time,
   gracefully handle variations in engine start and gear-shift-completion
   times, and operate in a manner that is transparent to the driver. A
   hardware problem with the test vehicle restricted its maximum engine
   torque, which prevented a reliable fuel economy assessment of the SP-SDP
   controller. The data that were collected indicated that SP-SDP
   controllers could be straightforwardly designed to operate at different
   points of the fuel economy tradeoff curve and that their fuel economy
   may equal or exceed that of a baseline industrial controller designed
   for the vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging is an essential tool for effective cancer management. Endoscopes
   are important medical instruments for performing in vivo imaging in
   hollow organs. Early detection of cancer can be achieved with
   surveillance using endoscopy, and has been shown to reduce mortality and
   to improve outcomes. Recently, great advancements have been made in
   endoscopic instruments, including new developments in optical designs,
   light sources, optical fibers, miniature scanners, and multimodal
   systems, allowing for improved resolution, greater tissue penetration,
   and multispectral imaging. In addition, progress has been made in the
   development of highly-specific optical probes, allowing for improved
   specificity for molecular targets. Integration of these new endoscopic
   instruments with molecular probes provides a unique opportunity for
   significantly improving patient outcomes and has potential to further
   improve early detection, image guided therapy, targeted therapy, and
   personalized medicine. This work summarizes current and evolving
   endoscopic technologies, and provides an overview of various promising
   optical molecular probes.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, improved wireless technologies have enabled the
   low-cost deployment of large numbers of sensors for a wide range of
   monitoring applications. Because of the computational resources
   (processing capability, storage capacity, etc.) collocated with each
   sensor in a wireless network, it is often possible to perform advanced
   data analysis tasks autonomously and in-network, eliminating the need
   for the post-pocessing of sensor data. With new parallel algorithms
   being developed for in-network computation, it has become necessary to
   create a framework in which all of a wireless network's scarce resources
   (CPU time, wireless bandwidth, storage capacity, battery power, etc.)
   can be best utilized in the midst of competing computational
   requirements. In this study, a market-based method is developed to
   autonomously distribute these scarce network resources across various
   computational tasks with competing objectives and/or resource demands.
   This method is experimentally validated on a network of wireless sensing
   prototypes, where it is shown to be capable of Pareto-optimally
   allocating scarce network resources. Then, it is applied to the
   real-world problem of rupture detection in shipboard chilled water
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Landfills are among the major sources of anthropogenic methane (CH4)
   estimated to reach 40x10(9)kg per year worldwide by 2015 (IPCC, 2007). A
   21/2-year field experiment was conducted at a closed landfill in western
   Michigan where methanotrophs, methane-consuming bacteria, were
   stimulated by nutrient addition to the soil without significantly
   increasing biogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) production. The effects of the
   nitrogen amendments (KNO3 and NH4Cl), phenylacetylene (a selective
   inhibitor of nitrifying bacteria that contribute to N2O production), and
   a canopy (to reduce direct water infiltration) on the vertical soil gas
   profiles of CH4, CO2, and O-2 were measured in the top meter of the
   soil. Methane and nitrous oxide fluxes were calculated from the
   corresponding soil gas concentration gradients with respect to depth and
   a Millington-Quirk diffusivity coefficient in soil derived empirically
   from soil porosity, water content, and diffusivity coefficients in air
   from the literature. Methane flux estimates were as high as 218.4 g
   m(-2) day(-1) in the fall and 12.8 g/m(-2) day(-1) in the summer. During
   the spring and summer, CH4 fluxes were reduced by more than half by
   adding KNO3 and NH4Cl into the soil as compared to control plots, while
   N2O fluxes increased substantially. The concurrent addition of
   phenylacetylene to the amendment decreased peak N2O production by half
   and the rate of peak methane oxidation by about one-third. The seasonal
   average methane and N2O flux data were extrapolated to estimate the
   reduction of CH4 and N2O fluxes into the atmosphere by nitrogen and
   inhibitor addition to the cover soils. The results suggest that such
   additions coupled with soil moisture management may provide a potential
   strategy to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from
   landfills.}},

Title = {{Fast Hydrothermal Liquefaction of Nannochloropsis sp To Produce Biocrude}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1391-1398}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the fast hydrothermal liquefaction of green marine alga
   Nannochloropsis sp. at batch reaction times of 1, 3, and 5 min and
   set-point temperatures of 300-600 degrees C. We also performed
   conventional liquefaction for 60 min at the same temperatures. These
   experiments cover the broadest range of reaction conditions yet reported
   for algae liquefaction. The biocrude yield obtained for 1 min reaction
   times, which was only long enough to heat the reactor from room
   temperature to about half of the set-point temperature (in degrees C),
   increased with an increasing set-point temperature to 66 +/- 11 wt \%
   (dry and ash-free basis) at a set-point temperature of 600 degrees C.
   The biocrude obtained at this condition contains 84\% of the carbon and
   91 +/- 14\% of the heating value present in the dry algae feedstock.
   This biocrude yield and corresponding energy recovery are the highest
   reported for liquefaction of this alga. For a reaction time of 1 min, as
   the set-point temperature increases, light biocrude (e.g., hexane
   solubles) makes up less of the total biocrude. The biocrudes produced by
   fast liquefaction have carbon contents and higher heating values similar
   to biocrudes from the traditional isothermal liquefaction process, which
   involves treatment for tens of minutes. These results indicate that
   biocrudes of similar quality may be produced in higher yields and in a
   fraction of the time previously thought necessary. Such a decrease in
   the reaction time would greatly reduce the reactor volume required for
   continuous biocrude production, subsequently reducing the capital costs
   of such a process. We also show that the reaction ordinate is a useful
   parameter for interpreting results from algae liquefaction performed at
   different temperatures and reaction times.}},

Title = {{Significant performance enhancement in photoconductive terahertz
   optoelectronics by incorporating plasmonic contact electrodes}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Even though the terahertz spectrum is well suited for chemical
   identification, material characterization, biological sensing and
   medical imaging, practical development of these applications has been
   hindered by attributes of existing terahertz optoelectronics. Here we
   demonstrate that the use of plasmonic contact electrodes can
   significantly mitigate the low-quantum efficiency performance of
   photoconductive terahertz optoelectronics. The use of plasmonic contact
   electrodes offers nanoscale carrier transport path lengths for the
   majority of photocarriers, increasing the number of collected
   photocarriers in a subpicosecond timescale and, thus, enhancing the
   optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiency of photoconductive terahertz
   emitters and the detection sensitivity of photoconductive terahertz
   detectors. We experimentally demonstrate 50 times higher terahertz
   radiation powers from a plasmonic photoconductive emitter in comparison
   with a similar photoconductive emitter with non-plasmonic contact
   electrodes, as well as 30 times higher terahertz detection sensitivities
   from a plasmonic photoconductive detector in comparison with a similar
   photoconductive detector with non-plasmonic contact electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on a new approach for enhancing security and
   privacy in certain RFID applications whereby location or
   location-related information (such as speed) can serve as a legitimate
   access context. Examples of these applications include access cards,
   toll cards, credit cards, and other payment tokens. We show that
   location awareness can be used by both tags and back-end servers for
   defending against unauthorized reading and relay attacks on RFID
   systems. On the tag side, we design a location-aware selective unlocking
   mechanism using which tags can selectively respond to reader
   interrogations rather than doing so promiscuously. On the server side,
   we design a location-aware secure transaction verification scheme that
   allows a bank server to decide whether to approve or deny a payment
   transaction and detect a specific type of relay attack involving
   malicious readers. The premise of our work is a current technological
   advancement that can enable RFID tags with low-cost location (GPS)
   sensing capabilities. Unlike prior research on this subject, our
   defenses do not rely on auxiliary devices or require any explicit user
   involvement.}},

Abstract = {{Supply chain disruptions come with catastrophic consequences in spite of
   their low probability of occurrence. In this paper, we consider a
   facility location problem in the presence of random facility disruptions
   where facilities can be protected with additional investments. Whereas
   most existing models in the literature implicitly assume that the
   disruption probability estimate is perfectly accurate, we investigate
   the impact of misestimating the disruption probability. Using a stylized
   continuous location model, we show that underestimation in disruption
   probability results in greater increase in the expected total cost than
   overestimation. In addition, we show that, when planned properly, the
   cost of mitigating the misestimation risk is not too high. Under a more
   generalized setting incorporating correlated disruptions and finite
   capacity, we numerically show that underestimation in both disruption
   probability and correlation degree result in greater increase in the
   expected total cost compared to overestimation. We, however, find that
   the impact of misestimating the correlation degree is much less
   significant relative to that of misestimating the disruption
   probability. Thus, managers should focus more on accurately estimating
   the disruption probability than the correlation.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Preliminary experiments of the recirculating planar magnetron microwave
   source have demonstrated that the device oscillates but is susceptible
   to intense mode competition due, in part, to poor coupling of RF fields
   between the two planar oscillators. A novel method of improving the
   cross-oscillator coupling has been simulated in the periodically slotted
   mode control cathode (MCC). The MCC, as opposed to a solid conductor, is
   designed to electromagnetically couple both planar oscillators by
   allowing for the propagation of RF fields and electrons through
   resonantly tuned gaps in the cathode. Using the MCC, a 12-cavity anode
   block with a simulated 1 GHz and 0.26 c phase velocity (where c is the
   speed of light) was able to achieve in-phase oscillations between the
   two sides of the device in as little as 30 ns. An analytic study of the
   modified resonant structure predicts the MCC's ability to direct the RF
   fields to provide tunable mode separation in the recirculating planar
   magnetron. The self-consistent solution is presented for both the
   degenerate even (in phase) and odd (180 degrees out of phase) modes that
   exist due to the twofold symmetry of the planar magnetrons. (C) 2013

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This study details a comparison of ion beam simulations with
   experimental data from a simplified plasma test cell in order to study
   and validate numerical models and environments representative of
   electric propulsion devices and their plumes. The simulations employ a
   combination of the direct simulation Monte Carlo and particle-in-cell
   methods representing xenon ions and atoms as macroparticles. An
   anisotropic collision model is implemented for momentum exchange and
   charge exchange interactions between atoms and ions in order to validate
   the post-collision scattering behaviors of dominant collision
   mechanisms. Cases are simulated in which the environment is either
   collisionless or non-electrostatic in order to prove that the collision
   models are the dominant source of low-and high-angle particle scattering
   and current collection within this environment. Additionally, isotropic
   cases are run in order to show the importance of anisotropy in these
   collision models. An analysis of beam divergence leads to better
   characterization of the ion beam, a parameter that requires careful
   analysis. Finally, suggestions based on numerical results are made to
   help guide the experimental design in order to better characterize the
   ion environment. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We present the latest improvements in the Center for Radiative Shock
   Hydrodynamics (CRASH) code, a parallel block-adaptive-mesh Eulerian code
   for simulating high-energy-density plasmas. The implementation can solve
   for radiation models with either a gray or a multigroup method in the
   flux-limited-diffusion approximation. The electrons and ions are allowed
   to be out of temperature equilibrium and flux-limited electron thermal
   heat conduction is included. We have recently implemented a CRASH laser
   package with 3-D ray tracing, resulting in improved energy deposition
   evaluation. New, more accurate opacity models are available which
   significantly improve radiation transport in materials like xenon. In
   addition, the HYPRE preconditioner has been added to improve the
   radiation implicit solver. With this updated version of the CRASH code
   we study radiative shock tube problems. In our set-up, a 1 ns, 3.8 kJ
   laser pulse irradiates a 20 micron beryllium disk, driving a shock into
   a xenon-filled plastic tube. The electrons emit radiation in the shocked
   xenon. This radiation preheats the unshocked xenon. Photons traveling
   ahead of the shock will also interact with the plastic tube, heat it,
   and in turn this can drive another shock off the wall into the xenon.

   measurements of the width before and after reshock {[}M. Vetter, B.
   Sturtevant, Shock Waves 4 (1995) 247; F. Poggi, M.H. Thorembey, G.
   Rodriguez, Phys. Fluids 10 (1998) 2698] and with the analytical
   self-similar power-law solution of the simplified model equations before
   reshock. A new procedure is introduced for the specification of the
   initial turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate, in which
   these quantities are related by the linear instability growth rate. The
   predicted mixing layer widths before reshock are shown to be sensitive
   to changes in the initial turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation
   rate, while the widths after reshock are sensitive to changes in the
   model coefficients c(epsilon 0) and sigma(rho) appearing in the buoyancy
   (shock) production terms in the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation
   rate equations. A set of model coefficients and initial conditions is
   shown to predict mixing layer widths in generally good agreement with
   the pre-reshock experimental data, and very good agreement with the
   post-reshock data for all cases. Budgets of the turbulent kinetic energy
   equation just before and after reshock for the Ma(s) = 1.24 case are
   used to identify the principal physical mechanisms generating turbulence
   in reshocked Richtmyer-Meshkov instability: buoyancy production
   (pressure work) and shear production. Numerical convergence of the
   mixing layer widths under spatial grid refinement is also demonstrated
   for each of the Mach numbers considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{IBM uses operations research techniques to plan its enterprise
   semiconductor supply chain. The scale and complexity of this planning
   problem make developing robust supply chain optimization tools a
   challenge. Pure optimization methods are computationally infeasible, and
   fast heuristic methods alone generate poor results. Consequently, we
   developed a method that decomposes the problem by dividing the bills of
   materials product structure horizontally and vertically into complex and
   simple portions that are based on the major stages in semiconductor
   manufacturing and the choices of supply chain paths for building parts.
   The method then solves the complex portions with a mixed-integer program
   and the simple portions with fast heuristics that contain small embedded
   linear programs. A unique pegging algorithm, an explosion heuristic, and
   an implosion linear program enable coordination among these portions.
   The result is a unified production, shipping, and distribution plan with
   no evidence of the original decomposition. This method has helped IBM to
   improve its asset utilization, customer service, and inventory levels.}},

Abstract = {{The strength and stability of steel columns that have suffered localized
   damage are investigated through analytical and computational means. An
   analytical model based on the Rayleigh-Ritz technique is employed in
   conjunction with detailed finite element models that were validated

   using the finite element models to assess the effect of location of
   damage, extent of damage, role of initial imperfection, as well as
   asymmetric damage on the stability of a steel column. Design guidelines
   utilizing commercial software typically found in a design office are
   presented to provide a practical technique for approximating the results
   obtained using the analytical and computational models. Analytical and
   simulation results show that localized flange loss in a steel column
   could lead to a severe reduction in its axial resistance. (c) 2013

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{An improved method has been developed to compute the thrust of a
   dual-mode scramjet, which is an engine with a combustor that operates
   both subsonically and supersonically. This strategy applies to any
   internal flow that can be modeled one-dimensionally. To handle the
   mathematical singularity at the location of thermal choking, the simple
   Shapiro method is expanded to create a new method that includes
   finite-rate chemistry and high-temperature gas properties. A forward
   shooting method is employed to find appropriate initial conditions for
   integration of the governing equations, which results in a unique
   transonic (choked) condition capable of reaching a supersonic state at
   the end of the domain. Solutions of the governing equations are computed
   using the propulsion code MASIV, which has been integrated into a
   hypersonic vehicle flight dynamics code. Computations for both ram-mode
   and scram-mode operations are compared to experimental results.
   Predictions are made for flight conditions of a hypersonic vehicle built
   around the given flowpath. Benefits of a pseudo-one-dimensional approach
   are that computational time is small and physical reasons for observed
   engine performance are easy to determine. Limitations include the fact
   that behavior of oblique shocks and other two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional phenomena in the combustor cannot be computed
   directly.}},

   obtained near the resonant frequencies. The presented results and
   analyses reveal that there exist both Helmholtz and higher-order
   resonances in the two-layer fluid system, which is similar to the
   single-layer fluid case. It is also found that the resonances are
   closely associated with the free surface elevation inside moonpool gap,
   not the wave elevation at the interfacial surface. In addition,
   parametric studies have been performed to identify the dependencies of
   hydrodynamic behavior on geometry and density stratification. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{When sodium- and potassium-containing fuel additives are used in
   internal combustion engines, the bright fluorescence that sodium and
   potassium atoms emit in the burned gas zone offers a large potential for
   spectroscopic combustion analysis. To utilize this potential
   quantitatively, it is crucial to fully understand all physical and
   chemical processes involved. This includes (1) the temperature
   dependence of the fluorescence intensity due to gas-phase collisions,
   (2) the pressure, temperature and equivalence ratio effects on
   thermodynamic equilibria in the burned gas zone and (3) pressure and
   temperature-dependent line shapes for quantitative correction of
   fluorescence reabsorption. High-speed imaging of sodium and potassium
   fluorescence in a spark-ignited, direct injection, single-cylinder
   research engine was conducted under well-controlled homogeneous
   operating conditions at equivalence ratios ranging from 0.71 to 1.43,
   cylinder pressure from 3 to 15 bar and burned gas temperatures from
   1,700 to 2,600 K. This study demonstrates that the influence of
   pressure, temperature and equivalence ratio on the fluorescence signals
   of sodium and potassium is understood quantitatively and establishes the
   potentials and limitations of this tool for burned gas temperature
   measurements with high temporal and two-dimensional spatial resolution
   in a homogeneously operated internal combustion engine.}},

Abstract = {{Paclitaxel (Taxol) is an anticancer drug that induces mitotic arrest via
   microtubule hyperstabilization but causes side effects due to its
   hydrophobicity and cellular promiscuity. The targeted cytotoxicity of
   hydrophilic paclitaxel-conjugated polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers has
   been demonstrated in cultured cancer cells. Mechanisms of action
   responsible for this cytotoxicity are unknown, that is, whether the
   cytotoxicity is due to paclitaxel stabilization of microtubules, as is
   whether paclitaxel is released intracellularly from the dendrimer. To
   determine whether the conjugated paclitaxel can bind microtubules, we
   used a combination of ensemble and sin le microtubule imaging techniques
   in vitro. We demonstrate that these conjugates adversely affect
   microtubules by (1) promoting the polymerization and stabilization of
   microtubules in a paclitaxel-dependent manner, and (2) bundling
   preformed microtubules in a paclitaxel-independent manner, potentially
   due to protonation of tertiary amines in the dendrimer interior. Our
   results provide mechanistic insights into the cytotoxicity of
   paclitaxel-conjugated PAMAM dendrimers and uncover unexpected risks of
   using such conjugates therapeutically.}},

Abstract = {{Vestibular rehabilitation therapy has been shown to improve balance and
   gait stability in individuals with vestibular deficits. However, patient
   compliance with prescribed home exercise programs is variable. Real-time
   feedback of exercise performance can potentially improve exercise
   execution, exercise motivation, and rehabilitation outcomes. The goal of
   this study is to directly compare the effects of visual and vibrotactile
   feedback on postural performance to inform the selection of a feedback
   modality for inclusion in a home-based balance rehabilitation device.
   Eight subjects (46.6 +/- 10.6 years) with peripheral vestibular deficits
   and eight age-matched control subjects (45.3 +/- 11.1 years)
   participated in the study. Subjects performed eyes-open tandem Romberg
   stance trials with (vibrotactile, discrete visual, continuous visual,
   and multimodal) and without (baseline) feedback. Main outcome measures
   included medial-lateral (M/L) and anterior-posterior mean and standard
   deviation of body tilt, percent time spent within a no-feedback zone,
   and mean score on a comparative ranking survey. Both groups improved
   performance for each feedback modality compared to baseline, with no
   significant differences in performance observed among vibrotactile,
   discrete visual, or multimodal feedback for either group. Subjects with
   vestibular deficits performed best with continuous visual feedback and
   ranked it highest. Although the control subjects performed best with
   continuous visual feedback in terms of mean M/L tilt, they ranked it
   lowest. Despite the observed improvements, continuous visual feedback
   involves tracking a moving target, which was noted to induce dizziness
   in some subjects with vestibular deficits and cannot be used during
   exercises in which head position is actively changed or during
   eyes-closed conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the concept of new electrically narrow very low
   profile (ENVELOP) directive antennas for low frequency radars and
   diversity communication applications. The basic structure consists of a
   short TEM horn combined with an inductive loop antenna. The proposed
   antenna height is 0.063 lambda(0) where lambda(0) is the minimum
   operating wavelength and has good matching and radiation characteristics
   over more than an octave. It is based on the principle of crossed
   electric and magnetic dipoles with a TEM horn as the electric dipole and
   a sheet loop as the magnetic dipole. However, unlike the standard
   structures, the proposed structure is designed to enhance the radiation
   in a direction perpendicular to the TEM horn axis. This limits the
   maximum pattern bandwidth to about one octave but allows the antenna
   height along the direction of maximum radiation to be very small which
   is very important for airborne radars and in low frequency military
   communications that require conformal antennas. Three different
   variations of the basic structure are also presented which offer
   improved pattern characteristics and/or pattern and polarization
   diversity. Two antennas were fabricated and measured. The measured
   results agreed well with the simulation results and both showed that the
   antenna can operate over 1-2 GHz with consistent radiation pattern, low
   dispersion and input impedance matching performance.}},

Abstract = {{Single-source time-domain electric-and magnetic-field integral equations
   for analyzing scattering from homogeneous penetrable objects are
   presented. Their temporal discretization is effected by using shifted
   piecewise polynomial temporal basis functions and a collocation testing
   procedure, thus allowing for a marching-on-in-time (MOT) solution
   scheme. Unlike dual-source formulations, single-source equations involve
   space-time domain operator products, for which spatial discretization
   techniques developed for standalone operators do not apply. Here, the
   spatial discretization of the single-source time-domain integral
   equations is achieved by using the high-order divergence-conforming
   basis functions developed by Graglia et al. alongside the high-order
   divergence- and quasi curl-conforming (DQCC) basis functions of Valdes
   et al. The combination of these two sets allows for a well-conditioned
   mapping from div- to curl-conforming function spaces that fully respects
   the space-mapping properties of the space-time operators involved.
   Numerical results corroborate the fact that the proposed procedure
   guarantees accuracy and stability of the MOT scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach for the miniaturization of circularly polarized patch
   antennas is presented. This enables a size reduction of as high as 75\%,
   compared to a conventional corner-truncated circularly polarized patch

   intermediate steps, each of which produces antenna miniaturization as
   well as the desired polarization and impedance matching properties. This
   is very challenging in miniaturizing circularly polarized probe-fed
   patch antennas. It is shown that two resonant frequencies can be tuned
   independently to produce a dual band antenna with two orthogonal
   polarizations. Finally, two circularly polarized miniaturized patch
   antennas with different miniaturization factors are fabricated, and
   their input impedances, radiation patterns and axial ratios are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Several magnetic resonance parallel imaging techniques require explicit
   estimates of the receive coil sensitivity profiles. These estimates must
   be accurate over both the object and its surrounding regions to avoid
   generating artifacts in the reconstructed images. Regularized estimation
   methods that involve minimizing a cost function containing both a
   data-fit term and a regularization term provide robust sensitivity
   estimates. However, these methods can be computationally expensive when
   dealing with large problems. In this paper, we propose an iterative
   algorithm based on variable splitting and the augmented Lagrangian
   method that estimates the coil sensitivity profile by minimizing a
   quadratic cost function. Our method, ADMM-Circ, reformulates the finite
   differencing matrix in the regularization term to enable exact
   alternating minimization steps. We also present a faster variant of this
   algorithm using intermediate updating of the associated Lagrange
   multipliers. Numerical experiments with simulated and real data sets
   indicate that our proposed method converges approximately twice as fast
   as the preconditioned conjugate gradient method over the entire
   field-of-view. These concepts may accelerate other quadratic
   optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{An underwater dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma jet excited by a
   repetitively pulsed nanosecond pulsed power modulator was used to study
   plasma-induced decolorization of a 1.4 x 10(-4) M solution of methylene
   blue (MB). Past plasma decolorization studies have focused on
   spectrophotometry as the main diagnostic to assess decomposition.
   Because spectrophotometry is a measure of changes in the structure of
   molecular color, it is not an absolute measure of decomposition. In this
   paper, high-pressure liquid chromatography is used in parallel with
   spectrophotometry for comparison purposes and to assess the degree of
   true decomposition. Spectrophotometry results were found to be in
   agreement with chromatography measurements, suggesting that, at least in
   the case of MB, spectrophotometry is an adequate measure of
   decomposition. Additionally, the utility of a dual plasma jet applicator
   for rapid contaminant decomposition was explored.}},

   the coefficients of trajectories are determined by boundary conditions,
   optimal performance index and collision avoidance conditions. The
   planned trajectory is feasible and has a closed loop expression, which
   is efficient for real-time updating. There are two main improvements
   compared with existing parametric approaches. Firstly, most of existing
   methods use the kinematic models of the robots, which could cause
   curvature discontinuities when trajectories are updated in real-time.
   Secondly, in some existing parametric methods, the initial position and
   ending waypoints cannot be aligned vertically due to singularities. The
   approach proposed in this paper overcomes this limitation. Computer
   simulations verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Restoring tissue oxygenation has the potential to improve poorly healing
   wounds with impaired microvasculature. Compared with more established
   wound therapy using hyperbaric oxygen chambers, topical oxygen therapy
   has lower cost and better patient comfort, although topical devices have
   provided inconsistent results. To provide controlled topical oxygen
   while minimizing moisture loss, a major issue for topical oxygen, we
   have devised a novel wound bandage based on microfluidic diffusion
   delivery of oxygen. In addition to modulating oxygen from 0 to 100\% in
   60 seconds rise time, the microfluidic oxygen bandage provides a
   conformal seal around the wound. When 100\% oxygen is delivered, it
   penetrates wound tissues as measured in agar phantom and in vivo wounds.
   Using this microfluidic bandage, we applied the oxygen modulation to 8
   mm excisional wounds prepared on diabetic mice. Treatment with the
   microfluidic bandage demonstrated improved collagen maturity in the
   wound bed, although only marginal differences were observed in total
   collagen, microvasculature, and external closure rates. Our results show
   that proper topical oxygen can improve wound parameters underneath the
   surface. Because of the ease of fabrication, the oxygen bandage
   represents an economical yet practical method for oxygen wound research.}},

Abstract = {{An aluminum lithium copper alloy was rapidly solidified via the
   electrospark deposition process. High-resolution scanning electron
   microscopy (HR-SEM), time-of-flight secondary-ion-mass-spectroscopy
   (TOF-SIMS) and atom probe tomography (APT) were employed to investigate
   the distribution of solute within the deposited materials. The TOF-SIMS
   data revealed evidence that solute trapping of lithium occurred during
   solidification, while SEM and APT revealed the presence of fine
   copper-rich cells within the microstructure (similar to 30-60 rim in
   width). This morphology correlated directly with the microstructural
   morphology predicted by the Kurz-Giovanola-Trivedi (KGT) model for
   microstructural development during rapid solidification. The KGT model,
   which can be used to describe the planar cellular transition within a
   microstructure, then predicted a solidification front velocity of
   similar to 1 m s(-1) being realized during electrospark deposition
   solidification. This SFV corroborated the chemical mapping data, and
   therefore supported the solute trapping hypothesis, as the continuous
   growth model for solute trapping as developed by Aziz and Kaplan (Acta
   Metallurgica 1988; 36:2335) predicts significant trapping of lithium at
   a SFV of 1 m s(-1). Finally APT revealed the presence of Al3Li phase
   upon the copper-rich cell walls. It was then determined that the Al3Li
   was not formed during solidification, as predicted by a time-dependent
   nucleation model for phase prediction during rapid solidification, and
   therefore is the result of a subsequent aging process. (C) 2012 Acta

Abstract = {{A nonlinear aeroelastic model suitable for flexible insectlike flapping

   obtained using an updated Lagrangian method. The paper describes
   validation studies conducted on the structural dynamic model,
   aerodynamic comparisons, and aeroelastic studies conducted on isotropic

   of MARC for modeling anisotropic wings undergoing insectlike wing
   kinematics. For the aeroelastic cases considered, the approximate model
   shows acceptable agreement with computational-fluid-dynamics-based and

Abstract = {{In a cognitive radio network (CRN), secondary users (SUs)
   opportunistically utilize idle licensed spectrum bands. We address the
   natural questions that arise when the incumbents or primary users (PUs)
   return to the channel the SUs are using opportunistically. Instead of
   immediately switching to another idle channel as proposed in almost all
   existing approaches, the SUs may opt to wait silently in their current
   channel until the PUs depart. This option would be beneficial to the SUs
   if the returned PUs stay at the channel only for a short period of time
   and the SUs' channel-switching incurs a non-negligible overhead. We
   determine how long the SUs should wait in their current channel before
   switching to a new idle channel.
   The SUs should also occasionally sense those (called out-ofband)
   channels currently not in use for sensing the availability of spectrum
   opportunities. We propose an efficient, adaptive spectrum-sensing
   technique to detect when a busy out-of-band channel becomes idle. We
   also present a spectrum-management architecture that integrates the SUs'
   strategies and facilitates fast discovery of spectrum opportunities.}},

   clearance was 18\% (all p < 0.005). The transmembrane clearance of
   albumin was negligible for all experiments. When measuring transmembrane
   pressure and filter drop pressure, no significant differences were found
   between nonvibration and vibration dialysis. The addition of vibration
   during dialysis increased transmembrane clearance for solutes with
   molecular weights of 60-1450 Daltons. ASAIO Journal 2013;59:140-144.}},

   the GSM standard for the wake-up of a wireless sensor network. The
   receiver was fabricated in 0.13 mu m CMOS and harvests a 21 Hz clock
   from the 1900-MHz GSM band. It was designed for heavily duty-cycled
   operation to reduce the energy required for synchronization of a
   network. In active mode, the receiver achieves a sensitivity of -87 dBm
   with 57 mu s of jitter while consuming 126 mu W. In sleep mode, the
   power consumption is 81 pW. Experiments conducted in the lab verify the
   functionality of the receiver with a real local GSM cellular signal.}},

Abstract = {{The risk for urinary incontinence can be 2.6-fold greater in women after
   pregnancy and childbirth compared with their never-pregnant
   counterparts, with the incidence increasing with parity. We tested the
   hypothesis that the incidence of de novo postpartum urinary incontinence
   in primiparous women is reduced with the use of spontaneous pushing
   alone or in combination with perineal massage compared with women who
   experienced traditional directed pushing for second-stage management.
   This was a prospective clinical trial enrolling and randomizing 249
   women into a four-group design: (1) routine care with coached or
   directed pushing, (2) spontaneous self-directed pushing, (3) prenatal
   perineal massage initiated in the third trimester, and (4) the
   combination of spontaneous pushing plus perineal massage. Self-report of
   incontinence was assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
   covariance (ANCOVA) models in 145 remaining women at 12 months
   postpartum using the Leakage Index, which is sensitive to minor leakage.
   No statistical difference in the incidence of de novo postpartum
   incontinence was found based on method of pushing (spontaneous/directed)
   (P value = 0.57) or in combination with prenatal perineal massage (P
   value = 0.57). Fidelity to pushing treatment of type was assessed and
   between-groups crossover detected.
   Spontaneous pushing did not reduce the incidence of postpartum
   incontinence experienced by women 1 year after their first birth due to
   high cross-over between randomization groups.}},

Abstract = {{In mammalian ovaries, many immature follicles remain after the dominant
   follicles undergo ovulation. Here we report the successful production of
   rabbit embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from oocytes produced by in vitro
   culture of immature follicles and subsequent in vitro maturation
   treatment. In total, we obtained 53 blastocysts from oocytes that
   received intracytoplasmic sperm injection followed by in vitro culture.
   Although only weak expression of POU5f1 was observed in the inner cell
   masses of in-vitro-cultured follicle-derived embryos, repeated careful
   cloning enabled establishment of 3 stable ESC lines. These ESC lines
   displayed the morphological characteristics of primed pluripotent stem
   cells. The ESC lines also expressed the pluripotent markers Nanog,
   POU5f1, and Sox2. Further, these ESCs could be differentiated into each
   of the 3 different germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. These results
   demonstrate that immature follicles from rabbits can be used to generate
   ESCs. Moreover, the use of rabbit oocytes as a cell source provides an
   experimental system that closely matches human reproductive and stem
   cell physiology.}},

Title = {{A New Method to Quantify Male Pelvic Floor Displacement From 2D
   Transperineal Ultrasound Images}},
Journal = {{UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{685-689}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To develop a method to quantify displacement of pelvic
   structures during contraction of the pelvic floor muscles from
   transperineal ultrasound images in men and investigate the reliability
   of the method between days.
   METHODS Ten healthy male volunteers (aged 28-41 years) attended 2
   separate data collection sessions. Ultrasound images were recorded
   during voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions in cine-loop (video)
   format with the transducer aligned in the midsagittal plane on the
   perineum. Five anatomic points were defined to represent contraction
   from striated urethral sphincter (SUS), levator ani (LA), and
   bulbocavernosus (BC) muscles. Displacement of each point was calculated
   between the relaxed and contracted-state images. Intraclass correlation
   coefficient (ICC) values were calculated from displacement data to
   assess reliability of the method between days.
   RESULTS Displacements of the 5 anatomic points closely matched
   predictions based on anatomic considerations of the male pelvic
   musculature. ICC values for displacement data calculated from 1, 2, and
   3 repetitions ranged between 0.82 and 0.95 for ICC (2,1), 0.85 and 0.97
   for ICC (2,2), and 0.86 and 0.97 for ICC (2,3), respectively.
   CONCLUSION The new method reliably calculates displacements of points
   previously validated for women (anorectal junction and bladder base) in
   addition to new measures of muscle actions (SUS and BC) specific to men.
   Future use might include assessment of clinical populations to
   understand how these displacements relate to symptoms of incontinence.

Pages = {{1267-1276}},

Abstract = {{Iron sulfide (FeS) has been extensively assessed as a reactive medium to
   remove both metals and halogenated organics from groundwater. However,
   to address its suitability as a material for permeable reactive barriers
   (PRBs), its propensity for solids and gas production, which result in
   reduced permeability, must be evaluated. The reduction in permeability
   for sands coated with FeS (as mackinawite), under the anoxic conditions
   often encountered at contaminated groundwater sites, was examined
   through column experiments and geochemical modeling under conditions of
   high calcium and nitrate, which have been previously shown to cause
   significant permeability reduction in zero-valent iron (ZVI) systems.
   The column experiments showed negligible production of both solids and
   gases. The geochemical modeling predicted a maximum reduction in
   permeability of 1\% due to solids and about 30\% due to gas formation
   under conditions for which a complete loss of permeability was predicted
   for ZVI systems. This difference in permeability reduction is driven by
   the differences in thermodynamic stability of ZVI and FeS in aqueous
   solutions. The results suggest that geochemical conditions that result
   in high permeability losses for ZVI systems will likely not be
   problematic for FeS-based reactive materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Non-Darcian effects on natural convective flow and heat transfer in a
   square enclosure filled with a porous medium was analyzed numerically
   using fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model. The transport equations
   were solved for various pertinent parameters using a finite element
   formulation based on the Galerkin method of weighted residuals. Such
   parameters included Rayleigh number, porosity, elasticity of the
   flexible wall, and the effective thermal conductivity of the porous
   medium. Further, the fluid domain was described by an
   Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation that is fully coupled to
   the structure domain. Different flow models for porous media such as
   Darcy's law model and Darcy-Forchheimer model were considered in this
   investigation. Comparisons of isotherms, streamlines, and average
   Nusselt number are made between rigid and FSI models. The results of
   this investigation showed that Rayleigh number and the elasticity of the
   flexible wall had a profound effect on the shape of the flexible wall
   and consequently on the heat transfer enhancement within the enclosure.

Abstract = {{Small-tip fast recovery (STFR) imaging is a new steady-state imaging
   sequence that is a potential alternative to balanced steady-state free
   precession. Under ideal imaging conditions, STFR may provide comparable
   signal-to-noise ratio and image contrast as balanced steady-state free
   precession, but without signal variations due to resonance offset. STFR
   relies on a tailored tip-up, or fast recovery, radiofrequency pulse to
   align the spins with the longitudinal axis after each data readout
   segment. The design of the tip-up pulse is based on the acquisition of a
   separate off-resonance (B0) map. Unfortunately, the design of fast (a
   few ms) slice- or slab-selective radiofrequency pulses that accurately
   tailor the excitation pattern to the local B0 inhomogeneity over the
   entire imaging volume remains a challenging and unsolved problem. We
   introduce a novel implementation of STFR imaging based on
   non-slice-selective tip-up pulses, which simplifies the radiofrequency
   pulse design problem significantly. Out-of-slice magnetization pathways
   are suppressed using radiofrequency-spoiling. Brain images obtained with
   this technique show excellent gray/white matter contrast, and point to
   the possibility of rapid steady-state T2/T1-weighted imaging with
   intrinsic suppression of cerebrospinal fluid, through-plane vessel
   signal, and off-resonance artifacts. In the future, we expect STFR
   imaging to benefit significantly from parallel excitation hardware and
   high-order gradient shim systems. Magn Reson Med, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{A theoretical analysis is provided to describe the recently proposed

   Current-coaxial flows with relatively low rates are found to allow

Abstract = {{The capability of processing robust Engineered Cementitious Composites
   (ECC) materials with consistent mechanical properties is crucial for
   gaining acceptance of this new construction material in various
   structural applications. ECC's tensile strain-hardening behavior and
   magnitude of tensile strain capacity are closely associated with fiber
   dispersion uniformity, which determines the fiber bridging strength,
   complementary energy, critical flaw size and degree of multiple-crack
   saturation. This study investigates the correlation between the
   rheological parameters of ECC mortar before adding PVA fibers,
   dispersion of PVA fibers, and ECC composite tensile properties. The
   correlation between Marsh cone flow rate and plastic viscosity was
   established for ECC mortar, justifying the use of the Marsh cone as a
   simple rheology measurement and control method before fibers are added.
   An optimal range of Marsh cone flow rate was found that led to improved
   fiber dispersion uniformity and more consistent tensile strain capacity
   in the composite. When coupled with the micromechanics based
   ingredient-tailoring methodology, this rheological control approach
   serves as an effective ECC fresh property design guide for achieving
   robust ECC composite hardening properties.}},

Journal = {{SHIPS AND OFFSHORE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-44}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a new structural analysis tool for the optimum
   design of ship structure; specifically an Efficient Stiffness Method
   (ESM) is presented by using beam elements for the three-dimensional
   modelling by employing the span point concept in conjunction with the
   eccentric system line concept. From our sample calculations, it is shown
   that the ESM for three-dimensional modelling is a very effective and
   efficient tool and that from the viewpoint of computing time and
   accuracy of results, the method has advantage over two-dimensional
   modelling and the finite element method. In 2010, a consolidated version
   of the Common Structural Rules (CSR) for Oil Tankers and Bulk Carriers
   was established by the International Association of Classification
   Societies (IACS). The CSR modified and strengthened the requirements for
   the structural design of ships compared with previous versions of
   classification rules. For example, in view of these new requirements
   regarding structural design, a three-hold analysis with asymmetric loads
   relative to the breadth direction should be considered under multiple
   loading conditions. This results in considerable additional time
   required for the analysis of ship structures. Furthermore, it requires
   much more time for optimum design, particularly when using the Finite
   Element Method (FEM) as is often required. Therefore, the new analysis
   method developed here to reduce the analysis computing time with
   sufficient accuracy may prove extremely valuable in the design stage.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the negative pressure values at which inertial cavitation
   consistently occurs in response to a single, two-cycle, focused
   ultrasound pulse were measured in several media relevant to
   cavitation-based ultrasound therapy. The pulse was focused into a
   chamber containing one of the media, which included liquids,
   tissue-mimicking materials, and ex vivo canine tissue. Focal waveforms
   were measured by two separate techniques using a fiber-optic hydrophone.
   Inertial cavitation was identified by high-speed photography in
   optically transparent media and an acoustic passive cavitation detector.
   The probability of cavitation (P-cav) for a single pulse as a function
   of peak negative pressure (p\_) followed a sigmoid curve, with the
   probability approaching one when the pressure amplitude was sufficient.
   The statistical threshold (defined as P-cav = 0.5) was between p\_ = 26
   and 30 MPa in all samples with high water content but varied between p\_
   = 13.7 and >36 MPa in other media. A model for radial cavitation bubble
   dynamics was employed to evaluate the behavior of cavitation nuclei at
   these pressure levels. A single bubble nucleus with an inertial
   cavitation threshold of p\_ = 28.2 megapascals was estimated to have a
   2.5 nm radius in distilled water. These data may be valuable for
   cavitation-based ultrasound therapy to predict the likelihood of
   cavitation at various pressure levels and dimensions of
   cavitation-induced lesions in tissue. (E-mail: adamdm@umich.edu) (C)

Abstract = {{The present work focuses on the impacts of engine operating conditions
   and combustion phasing on diesel soot properties. The study was carried
   out in a 2.5 L direct injection common-rail turbodiesel engine using an
   ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (BP15). The study has two objectives. The
   first objective is to investigate the reactivity difference of the soot
   generated at four engine modes, spanning conditions of most interest in
   the engine operating map. The results show that the impact of engine
   speed at constant torque is more pronounced than the impact of engine
   torque (equivalence ratio) at constant engine speed. The effect of the
   engine torque at constant engine speed, especially at higher speed, is
   not observable in this experiment. The second objective is to
   investigate the reactivity and nanostructure of soot generated at
   different combustion phasing by advancing and retarding the fuel start
   of injection (SOI) timing. Reaction kinetics obtained from
   thermogravimetric analysis show that the rate constant of the sample for
   retarding SOI timing (retarded 2 CAD) is 2.3 times that for advancing
   SOI timing (advanced 2 CAD). In summary, the results presented here
   provide unique insights into the methodology that should be used when
   investigating soot samples generated by different fuels: matching
   operating modes and combustion phasing for different fuels is suggested
   while collecting soot samples for characterization. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Phosphorus is frequently reported as a doping element for TiO2 as
   photocatalyst; however, the previously reported methods used to prepare
   P-doped TiO2 do not allow control over the location of the phosphorus
   either in the bulk or at the surface or both. In this study, we report
   on the surface modification of Evonik P25 with phosphonic (H3PO3) and
   octylphosphonic acid {[}C8H17-PO(OH)(2)], done to limit the introduction
   of phosphorus only to the photocatalyst surface. The effect of this
   element on the thermal behavior and photocatalytic properties is
   reported through characterization using elemental analyses, solid state
   P-31 NMR, X-ray powder diffraction, N-2 porosimetry, dilatometry, etc.
   Thus, the objective of the work reported here is to focus on the role(s)
   that phosphorus plays only at TiO2 crystallite surfaces. For comparison,
   other samples were treated with phosphoric acid. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the extent to which tibial plateau cartilage displays
   non-uniform mechanical topography under physiologically relevant loading
   conditions is critical to evaluating the role of biomechanics in knee
   osteoarthritis. Cartilage explants from 21 tibial plateau sites of eight
   non-osteoarthritic female cadaveric knees (age: 4154; BMI: 1420) were
   tested in unconfined compression at 100\% strain/s. The elastic tangent
   modulus at 10\% strain (E10\%) was calculated for each site and averaged
   over four geographic regions: not covered by meniscus (I); covered by
   meniscusanterior (II); covered by meniscusexterior (III); and covered by
   meniscusposterior (IV). A repeated-measures mixed model analysis of
   variance was used to test for effects of plateau, region, and their
   interaction on E10\%. Effect sizes were calculated for each region pair.
   E10\% was significantly different (p?<?0.05) for all regional
   comparisons, except III and IIIIV. The regional pattern of variation was
   consistent across individuals. Moderate to strong effect sizes were
   evident for regional comparisons other than III on the lateral side and
   IIIIV on both sides. Healthy tibial cartilage exhibits significant
   mechanical heterogeneity that manifests in a common regional pattern
   across individuals. These findings provide a foundation for evaluating
   the biomechanical mechanisms of knee osteoarthritis. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The constriction resistance and the current flow pattern are calculated
   analytically in a vertical thin film contact in which the thin film base
   is an equipotential surface. Both Cartesian and cylindrical thin film
   contacts are studied. The resistivities and the geometric dimensions in
   the individual contact members may assume arbitrary values. General
   scaling laws are constructed for the constriction resistance for
   arbitrary resistivity ratios and geometric aspect ratios. The analytic
   solutions are validated using a simulation code. Current crowding at the
   edges is displayed. In the limit of small film thickness, we show that
   current crowding in the vertical contact is far less serious than the
   current crowding in the horizontal contact. The data show that the
   normalized constriction resistance depends predominantly on the geometry
   of the thin film, but is relatively insensitive to the height and to the
   resistivity of the member with which the thin film is in contact.}},

   is obtained using both a singular value decomposition and matrix
   square-root method. Conditions for uniqueness of solutions are also
   obtained, correcting some errors in the existing literature. It is then
   shown that under a mild condition, Wahba's problem can be recast as a
   convex optimization problem with linear matrix inequality constraints.
   This opens the door to a whole host of new possible solution methods for
   these types of Wahba problems.}},

Abstract = {{Cell patterning technologies that are fast, easy to use and affordable
   will be required for the future development of high throughput cell
   assays, platforms for studying cell-cell interactions and tissue
   engineered systems. This detailed protocol describes a method for
   generating co-cultures of cells using biocompatible solutions of dextran
   (DEX) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) that phase-separate when combined
   above threshold concentrations. Cells can be patterned in a variety of
   configurations using this method. Cell exclusion patterning can be
   performed by printing droplets of DEX on a substrate and covering them
   with a solution of PEG containing cells. The interfacial tension formed
   between the two polymer solutions causes cells to fall around the
   outside of the DEX droplet and form a circular clearing that can be used
   for migration assays. Cell islands can be patterned by dispensing a
   cell-rich DEX phase into a PEG solution or by covering the DEX droplet
   with a solution of PEG. Co-cultures can be formed directly by combining
   cell exclusion with DEX island patterning. These methods are compatible
   with a variety of liquid handling approaches, including manual
   micropipetting, and can be used with virtually any adherent cell type.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the risk of musculoskeletal
   disorders to the hand-wrist system. The American Conference of
   Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) proposed threshold limit
   values (TLV (c)) based on hand activity level (HAL) and normalized peak
   force (PF). We validated ACGIH TLV (c) in OCTOPUS, a large cohort study
   on carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
   Methods Industrial and service workers were followed from 2000-2003. We
   classified subjects with respect to action limit (AL) and TLV Case
   definitions were: (i) self-reported symptoms; and (ii) combination of
   symptoms and positive nerve conduction studies. Poisson regression
   models including age, gender, body mass index, and presence of
   predisposing pathologies were conducted to estimate incidence rate
   ratios (IRR) of CTS.
   Results There were 4097 eligible workers. Of these, 236 (5.8\%) were
   non-responders, 2194 (53.6\%) had a complete follow-up, 728 (17.8\%)
   were lost after intermediate assessment, and 939 (22.9\%) were lost
   after baseline. Among the 3860 subjects with complete information at
   baseline, 2599 (67.3\%) were women {[}mean age 38.1 {[}standard
   deviation (SD) 9.5] years; mean body mass index (BMI) 23.8 (SD 3.9)
   kg/m(2)]. ACGIH TLV classification predicted both CTS symptoms {[}IRR
   between AL and TLV 2.43 {[}95\% confidence interval (95\% CI)
   1.77-3.33]; above TLV 3.32 (95\% CI 2.34-4.72)] and CTS confirmed by
   nerve conduction studies {[}IRR between AL and TLV 1.95 (95\% CI
   1.21-3.16); above TLV 2.70 (95\% CI 1.48-4.91)].
   Conclusions We found a dose response relationship between ACGIH TLV (c)
   classification and risk of CTS. The increased risk observed for workers
   exposed between AL and TLV suggests that the current AL and TLV might
   not be sufficiently protective.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to discriminate cell adhesion molecule expression between
   healthy and inflamed endothelium is critical for therapeutic
   intervention in many diseases. This study explores the effect of laminar
   flow on TNF-induced E-selectin surface expression levels in human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) relative to IL-1-induced
   expression via flow chamber assays. HUVECs grown in static culture were
   either directly (naive) activated with cytokine in the presence of
   laminar shear or pre-exposed to 12h of laminar shear (shear-conditioned)
   prior to simultaneous shear and cytokine activation. Naive cells
   activated with cytokine in static served as control. Depending on the
   cell shear history, fluid shear is found to differently affect
   TNF-induced relative to IL-1-induced HUVEC expression of E-selectin.
   Specifically, E-selectin surface expression by naive HUVECs is enhanced
   in the 812h activation time range with simultaneous exposure to shear
   and TNF (shear-TNF) relative to TNF static control whereas enhanced
   E-selectin expression is observed in the 424h range for shear-IL-1
   treatment relative to IL-1 static control. While exposure of HUVECs to
   shear preconditioning mutes shear-TNF-induced E-selectin expression, it
   enhances or down-regulates shear-IL-1-induced expression dependent on
   the activation period. Under dual-cytokine-shear conditions, IL-1
   signaling dominates. Overall, a better understanding of E-selectin
   expression pattern by human ECs relative to the combined interaction of
   cytokines, shear profile and history can help elucidate many disease
   pathologies. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110: 9991003. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{Many variants of vascular-targeted carriers (VTCs) have been
   investigated for therapeutic intervention in several human diseases.
   However, in order to optimize the functionality of VTC in vivo,
   carriers' physical properties, such as size and shape, are important
   considerations for a VTC design that evades the reticuloendothelial
   system (RES) and successfully interacts with the targeted vessel wall.
   Nonetheless, little evidence has been presented on the role of size in
   VTC's interactions with the vascular wall, particularly in the
   microcirculation. Thus, in this work, we explore how particle size,
   along with hemodynamics (blood shear rate and vessel size) and
   hemorheology (blood hematocrit) affect the capacity for spheres to
   marginate (localize and adhere) to inflamed endothelium in a
   microfluidic model of human microvessels. Microspheres, particularly the
   2 mu m spheres, were found to show disproportionately higher margination
   than nanospheres in all hemodynamic conditions evaluated due to the poor
   ability of the latter to localize to the wall region from midstream.
   This work represents the first evidence that nanospheres may not exhibit
   ``near wall excess{''} in microvessels, e.g., arterioles and venules,
   and therefore may not be suitable for imaging and drug delivery
   applications in cancer and other diseases affecting microvessels.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term memory implies the existence of a capacity limit beyond which
   memory cannot be securely formed and retained. The underlying mechanisms
   are believed to be two primary factors: decay and interference. Here, we
   demonstrate through both simulation and experiment that the memory
   capacity effect can be implemented in a parallel memristor circuit,
   where decay and interference are achieved by the inherent ion diffusion
   in the device and the competition for current supply in the circuit,
   respectively. This study suggests it is possible to emulate high-level
   biological behaviors with memristor circuits and will stimulate
   continued studies on memristor-based neuromorphic circuits. (C) 2013

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},

Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{We present a theoretical analysis of the finite-temperature equilibrium
   surface reconstruction stability of GaAs(001) from first principles,
   encompassing the As-rich regime relevant to low-temperature grown GaAs.
   Experimental evidence points to the thermodynamic stability of a (4 x 3)
   reconstruction in this regime, but density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations predict all (4 x 3) reconstructions to be metastable
   relative to the beta 2(2 x 4) and c(4 x 4) reconstructions. We employ
   statistical mechanical simulations, parameterized by DFT to study the
   combined effects of configurational disorder and vibrational excitations
   on surface phase stability. The calculated finite-temperature surface
   free energies of the various reconstructions indicate that, if a small
   constant energy shift is used to enforce stability of the lowest-energy
   (4 x 3), the resultant phase diagram is consistent with experiment with
   the c(4 x 4) overwhelming (4 x 3) at high temperatures. This behavior is
   due to competition between configurational entropy, which favors c(4 x
   4), and vibrational entropy, which favors (4 x 3). DOI:

Abstract = {{Organization of nanoparticles (NPs) of different materials into
   superstructures of higher complexity represents a key challenge in
   nanotechnology. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in this study
   to fabricate chains consisting of plasmonic NPs of different sizes, thus
   denoted heterochains. The NPs in such chains are connected by DNA
   oligomers, alternating in a sequence big-small-big-small- ... and
   spanning lengths in the range of 40-300 nm by varying the number of PCR
   cycles. They display strong plasmonic chirality at 500-600 nm, the
   chiral activity revealing nonmonotonous dependence on the length of
   heterochains. We find the strength of surface-enhanced Raman scattering
   (SERS) to increase with chain length, while the chiral response
   initially increased and then decreased with the number of PCR cycles.
   The relationship between the optical properties of the heterochains and
   their structure/length is discussed. The length-dependent intense
   optical response of the plasmonic NP heterochains holds great potential
   for biosensing applications.}},

   TWT. The described model examines how gain and instantaneous 1-dB
   bandwidth of the backward-wave mode is affected by random fabrication
   errors, which are modeled as random perturbations of the phase velocity,
   interaction impedance, and loss along the TWT's length. Random variation
   of the phase velocity is found to have the largest effect on both the
   backward-wave gain and the bandwidth while having only a minor effect on
   fundamental, forward-wave mode behavior. (C) 2013 American Institute of

Abstract = {{The structural behavior of three amphiphilic semicrystalline
   poly(isoprene-b-ethylene oxide) block copolymers (PI-b-PEO) with
   different PEO volume fraction (f(PEO) = 0.32, 0.49, and 0.66),
   spin-coated on freshly cleaved mica surfaces from aqueous solutions, was
   investigated by atomic force microscopy. We focus on the dependence of
   the resulting thin film nanostructures on the molecular characteristics
   (f(PEO) and molecular weight) and the adsorbed amount. The
   nanostructures obtained immediately after spin-coating were robust and
   remained unchanged after annealing and/or aging. The PEO affinity for
   the highly hydrophilic mica and the tendency of the hydrophobic and low
   surface energy PI to dewet and be at the free interface caused the soft
   PI-b-PEO micelles to collapse leading to the formation of 2D dendritic
   networks over mica. We show that, for all three polymers, the dendritic
   monolayer thickness can be predicted by a model consisting of a PEO
   crystallized layer (directly on top of mica) of the same thickness in
   all cases and a PI brush layer on top. In thicker areas, polymer
   material self-assembled into conelike multilamellar bilayers on top of
   the monolayer and oriented parallel to the substrate for both symmetric
   and asymmetric diblock copolymers with the lowest f(PEO). We compare the
   lateral morphology of the films and discuss the thickness heterogeneity,
   which results from the coupling and competition of crystallization
   kinetics, phase separation, and wetting/dewetting phenomena highlighting
   the role of the two blocks to inhibit or enhance certain morphologies.
   We show that the deviation of the f(PEO) = 0.32 thin film from its bulk
   phase structure (cylinders in hexagonal lattice) continues for several
   lamellar bilayers away from the substrate. For the asymmetric PI-b-PEO
   polymer with the higher PEO volume fraction (f(PEO) = 0.66) and higher
   APT, laterally extensive stacks of flat-on lamellar crystallites formed
   on the surface demonstrating the crucial role of the PEO
   crystallization.}},

Abstract = {{A spatial potential trap is formed in a 6.0-mu m Al(Ga)N nanowire by
   varying the Al composition along its length during epitaxial growth. The
   polariton emission characteristics of a dielectric microcavity with the
   single nanowire embedded in-plane have been studied at room temperature.
   Excitation is provided at the Al(Ga) N end of the nanowire, and
   polariton emission is observed from the lowest bandgap GaN region within
   the potential trap. Comparison of the results with those measured in an
   identical microcavity with a uniform GaN nanowire and having an
   identical exciton-photon detuning suggests evaporative cooling of the
   polaritons as they are transported into the trap in the Al(Ga) N
   nanowire. Measurement of the spectral characteristics of the polariton
   emission, their momentum distribution, first-order spatial coherence,
   and time-resolved measurements of polariton cooling provides strong
   evidence of the formation of a near-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate
   in the GaN region of the nanowire at room temperature. In contrast, the
   condensate formed in the uniform GaN nanowire-dielectric microcavity
   without the spatial potential trap is only in self-equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{Soluble oligomers of the amyloid-beta peptide have been implicated as
   proximal neurotoxins in Alzheimer's disease. However, the identity of
   the neurotoxic aggregate(s) and the mechanisms by which these species
   induce neuronal dysfunction remain uncertain. Physiologically relevant
   experimentation is hindered by the low endogenous concentrations of the
   peptide, the metastability of A beta oligomers, and the wide range of
   observed interactions between A beta and biological membranes.
   Single-molecule microscopy represents one avenue for overcoming these
   challenges. Using this technique, we find that A beta binds to primary
   rat hippocampal neurons at physiological concentrations. Although
   amyloid-beta(1-40) as well as amyloid-beta(1-42) initially form larger
   oligomers on neurites than on glass slides, a 1:1 mix of the two
   peptides result in smaller neurite-bound oligomers than those detected
   on-slide or for either peptide alone. With 1 nM peptide in solution, A
   beta 40 oligomers do not grow over the course of 48 h, A beta 42
   oligomers grow slightly, and oligomers of a 1:1 mix grow substantially.
   Evidently, small A beta oligomers are capable of binding to neurons at
   physiological concentrations and grow at rates dependent on local A beta
   42:A beta 40 ratios. These results are intriguing in light of the
   increased A beta 42:A beta 40 ratios shown to correlate with familial
   Alzheimer's disease mutations.}},

Abstract = {{We show that hot phonons emitted in energy conversion or resistive
   processes can be converted to electric potential in heterobarrier
   structures. Using phonon and electron interaction kinetics and
   self-consistent ensemble Monte Carlo, we find the favorable conditions
   for unassisted absorption of hot phonons and design graded
   heterobarriers for their direct conversion into electric energy. Tandem
   barriers with nearly optical-phonon height allow for substantial
   potential gain without current loss. We find that 19\% of hot phonons
   can be harvested with an optimized GaAs/AlxGa1-x As barrier structure

   excellent agreement with Hartmann's data. The simulations provide a
   first detailed view of the flow structures that are experimentally

   discovered. We finally suggest how these predictions can be tested in a

Abstract = {{We have investigated the radiative properties of InGaN disks in GaN
   nanowires grown by plasma enhanced molecular beam epitaxy on (001)
   silicon substrates. The growth of the nanowire heterostructures has been
   optimized to maximize the radiative efficiency, or internal quantum
   efficiency (IQE), for photoluminescence emission at lambda = 650 nm. It
   is found that the IQE increases significantly (by similar to 10\%) to
   52\%, when post-growth passivation of nanowire surface with silicon
   nitride or parylene is applied. The increase in efficiency is supported
   by radiative- and nonradiative lifetimes derived from data obtained from
   temperature dependent-and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements.
   Light emitting diodes with p-i-n disk-in-nanowire heterostructures
   passivated with parylene have been fabricated and characterized. (C)

Title = {{A hybrid planar-mixed tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene/C-70 photovoltaic

Abstract = {{We describe a hybrid planar-mixed heterojunction (PM-HJ) organic
   photovoltaic cell based on tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) and
   C-70 with a power conversion efficiency of up to 6.4\% +/- 60.3\%.
   Optimized cells consist of a DBP: C-70 mixed layer at a volume ratio of
   1: 8 and a 9-nm thick C-70 cap layer. The external quantum efficiency
   (EQE) in the visible of the PM-HJ cell is up to 10\% larger than the
   mixed-HJ cell that lacks a C-70 acceptor cap layer. The improvement in
   EQE is attributed to reduced exciton quenching at the MoO3 anode buffer
   layer surface. This leads to an internal quantum efficiency >90\%
   between the wavelengths of lambda = 450 nm and 550 nm, suggesting
   efficient exciton dissociation and carrier extraction in the PM-HJ cell.
   The power conversion efficiency under simulated AM 1.5G, 1 sun
   irradiation increases from 5.7\% +/- 60.2\% for the mixed-HJ cell to
   6.4\% 60.3\% for the PM-HJ cell, with a short-current density of

Abstract = {{Mutations in several glycosyltransferases underlie a group of muscular
   dystrophies known as glycosylation-deficient muscular dystrophy. A
   common feature of these diseases is loss of glycosylation and consequent
   dystroglycan function that is correlated with severe pathology in
   muscle, brain and other tissues. Although glycosylation of dystroglycan
   is essential for function in skeletal muscle, whether
   glycosylation-dependent function of dystroglycan is sufficient to
   explain all complex pathological features associated with these diseases
   is less clear. Dystroglycan glycosylation is defective in LARGE(myd)
   (myd) mice as a result of a mutation in
   like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE), a glycosyltransferase known
   to cause muscle disease in humans. We generated animals with restored
   dystroglycan function exclusively in skeletal muscle by crossing myd
   animals to a recently created transgenic line that expresses LARGE
   selectively in differentiated muscle. Transgenic myd mice were
   indistinguishable from wild-type littermates and demonstrated an
   amelioration of muscle disease as evidenced by an absence of muscle
   pathology, restored contractile function and a reduction in serum
   creatine kinase activity. Moreover, although deficits in nerve
   conduction and neuromuscular transmission were observed in myd animals,
   these deficits were fully rescued by muscle-specific expression of
   LARGE, which resulted in restored structure of the neuromuscular
   junction (NMJ). These data demonstrate that, in addition to muscle
   degeneration and dystrophy, impaired neuromuscular transmission
   contributes to muscle weakness in dystrophic myd mice and that the noted
   defects are primarily due to the effects of LARGE and glycosylated
   dystroglycan in stabilizing the endplate of the NMJ.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale pyrite FeS2 is considered to be one of few potentially
   transformative materials for photovoltaics capable of bridging the
   cost/performance gap of solar batteries. It also holds promise for
   energy storage applications as the material for high-performance
   cathodes. Despite prospects, the synthesis of FeS2 nanostructures and
   diversity of their geometries has been hardly studied. Moreover, the
   state-of-the-art aqueous dispersions of nanoscale pyrite, which have
   special significance for solar energetics, are particularly
   disappointing due to low quality. There are no known methods to produce
   well-crystallized nanoparticles and other geometries of nanoscale pyrite
   in water or mixed aqueous solvents. Here, we describe a successful
   synthesis of single-phase pyrite nanoparticles with a diameter of 2-5 nm
   in polar solvent and aqueous dispersions. The particles display high
   uniformity and crystallographic purity. Moreover, the synthetic approach
   developed for nanoparticles was proven to be quite universal and can be
   modified to produce both nanowires and nanosheets, which also display
   high crystallinity. The diameter of the pyrite nanowires was 80-120 am
   with the length exceeding 5 mu m. The nanosheets displayed lateral
   dimensions of 100-200 nm with the thickness of 2 nm. Availability of
   single-phase FeS2 nanoscale aqueous dispersions is expected to stimulate
   further studies of these materials in green energy conversion
   technologies and drug delivery applications.}},

   efficiency}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{alpha-voltaics harvest electron-hole pairs created as energetic a
   particles collide with and ionize electrons in a semiconductor, creating
   delta-rays. After ionization, charged pair production continues through
   delta-ray impact ionization events and the Auger relaxation of
   core-shell holes created through K-shell ionization events. Secondary
   ionization events are quantified using the TPP-2M model, the fraction of
   K-shell ionization events is determined using the energy-loss
   Coulomb-repulsion perturbed-stationary-state relativistic theory, and
   the relaxation of the resulting holes is treated with a fully ab initio
   approach using multiple Fermi golden rule calculations for ranges of
   carrier concentrations and temperatures. The limiting rate is 15 ns(-1)
   for small carrier concentrations and high temperatures, as compared to
   the radiative core-shell relaxation rate estimated here at 20 ns(-1),
   indicating that Auger modes contribute significantly. Moreover, the
   K-shell ionization events are shown to dominate for low energy a
   particles and vanish for high energy ones. Thus, the efficiency loss due
   to energy dissipation in the fuel layer is mitigated, which is
   demonstrated by the analysis of a layered fuel-voltaic device with an
   efficiency from 20\% to 14\% for fuel layers between 5 and 10 mu m
   thick. The design of a alpha-voltaic integrated with a thermoelectric
   generator is suggested for improved efficiency and the system-level
   mitigation of radiation damage and geometric inefficiency. (C) 2013

Title = {{The effects of actuator selection on non-volitional postural responses
   to torso-based vibrotactile stimulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Torso-based vibrotactile feedback may significantly reduce
   postural sway in balance-compromised adults during quiet standing or in
   response to perturbations. However, natural non-volitional postural
   responses to vibrotactile stimulation applied to the torso remain
   unknown.
   Methods: The primary goal of this study was to determine, for two types
   of actuators (tactors) and in the absence of instruction, whether
   vibrotactile stimulation induces a directional postural shift as a
   function of stimulation location. Eleven healthy young adults (20 - 29
   years old) were asked to maintain an upright erect posture with feet
   hip-width apart and eyes closed. Two types of tactors, Tactaid and C2,
   which differ in design and stimulation strength, were placed on the skin
   over the right and left external oblique, internal oblique, and erector
   spinae muscles in a horizontal plane corresponding approximately to the
   L4/L5 level. Each tactor of the same type was activated twice randomly
   for each individual location and twice simultaneously for all locations
   at a frequency of 250 Hz for a period of 5 s.
   Results: Vibration applied over the internal oblique and erector spinae
   muscle locations induced a postural shift in the direction of the
   stimulation regardless of the tactor type. For the aforementioned four
   locations, the root-mean-square (RMS) and power spectral density (PSD)
   of the body sway in both the A/P and M/L directions were also
   significantly greater during the vibration than before or after, and
   were greater for the C2 tactors than for the Tactaid tactors. However,
   simultaneous activation of all tactors or those over the external
   oblique muscle locations did not produce significant postural responses
   regardless of the tactor type.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that the use of a torso-based
   vibrotactile sensory augmentation display should carefully consider the
   tactor type as well as the instruction of corrective movements.
   Attractive instructional cues ({''}move in the direction of the
   vibration{''}) are compatible with the observed non-volitional response
   to stimulation and may facilitate postural adjustments during
   vibrotactile biofeedback balance applications.}},

   showed reduced lithium-intercalation capacity when compared with SLG,
   BLG and Bare-Cu suggesting its substrate protective nature (barrier to
   Li-ions). Although graphene films on Ni (Ni-G) showed better Li-cycling
   ability similar to that of other carbons suggesting that the presence of
   graphene edge planes (typical of Ni-G) is important in effective uptake

Abstract = {{This paper describes a system to study how small physical perturbations
   can affect bacterial community behavior in unexpected ways through
   modulation of diffusion and convective transport of chemical
   communication molecules and resources. A culture environment that mimics
   the chemically open characteristic of natural bacterial habitats but
   with user-defined spatiotemporal control of bacteria microcolonies is
   realized through use of an aqueous two phase system (ATPS). The ATPS is
   formulated with nontoxic dextran (DEX) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
   dissolved in cell culture media. DEX-phase droplets formed within a bulk
   PEG-phase stably confine the bacteria within it while small molecules
   diffuse relatively freely. Bacteria-containing DEX droplets can also be
   magnetically relocated, without loss of its bacterial content, when
   DEX-conjugated magnetic particles are included. We found that decreasing
   the distance between quorum-sensing (QS)-coupled microcolonies increased
   green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression due to increased inter-colony
   chemical communication but with upper limits. Periodic relocation of the
   chemical signal receiver colony, however, increased GFP expression
   beyond these typical bounds predicted by quorum sensing concepts alone
   by maintaining inter-colony chemical communication while also relieving
   the colony of short-range resource depletion effects. Computer
   simulations suggest that such increased productive output in response to
   periodic nonlethal physical perturbations is a common feature of
   chemically activated interactive cell systems where there is also a
   short-range inhibitory effect. In addition to providing insights on the
   effect of bacteria relocation, the magnetic ATPS droplet manipulation
   capability should be broadly useful for bioanalyses applications where
   selective partitioning at the microscale in fully aqueous conditions is
   needed.}},

Abstract = {{The current flow pattern, together with the contact resistance, is
   calculated analytically in a Cartesian 3-terminal thin film contact with
   dissimilar materials. The resistivities and the geometric dimensions in
   the individual contact members, as well as the terminal voltages, may
   assume arbitrary values. We show that the current flow patterns and the
   contact resistance may be conveniently decomposed into the even and odd
   solution. The even solution gives exclusively and totally the current
   flowing from the source to the gate. The odd solution gives exclusively
   and totally the current flowing from the source to the drain. Current
   crowding at the edges, and current partition in different regions are
   displayed. The analytic solutions are validated using a simulation code.
   The bounds on the variation of the contact resistance are given. This
   paper may be considered as the generalization of the transmission line
   model and the Kennedy-Murley model that were used extensively in the
   characterization of thin-film devices. For completeness, we include the
   general results for the cylindrical geometry, which are qualitatively
   similar to the even solution of the Cartesian geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Light funneling in metal/dielectric multilayer films with subwavelength

   at the resonant wavelength can be completely funneled into dielectric

   area within one period and absorbed by a resonant cavity composed of
   metal/dielectric multilayer films. A narrower resonant dip is observed
   than that produced by bulk metals with the same thickness and grooves.
   The mechanism and influencing factors of the reflection spectrum,
   including groove widths, layer numbers, and the profile of the groove
   side wall are comprehensively analyzed. Coupling between adjacent
   grooves with different depths are also discussed. Our study can be
   applied in the applications of biological sensing and infrared

Abstract = {{A multi-component nanosystem based on graphene and comprising individual
   cyclodextrins at its surface is assembled, creating hybrid structures
   enabling new and important functionalities: optical imaging, drug
   storage, and cell targeting for medical diagnosis and treatment. These
   nanohybrids are part of a universal system of interchangeable units,
   capable of mutilple functionalities. The surface components, made of
   individual -cyclodextrin molecules, are the hosts for functional units,
   which may be used as imaging agents, for anti-cancer drug delivery, and
   as tumor-specific ligands. Specifically, individual -cyclodextrin (-CD),
   with a known capability to host various molecules, is considered a
   module unit that is assembled onto graphene nanosheet (GNS). The
   cyclodextrin-functionalized graphene nanosheet (GNS/-CD) enables
   hostguest chemistry between the nanohybrid and functional payloads. The
   structure, composition, and morphology of the graphene nanosheet hybrid
   have been investigated. The nanohybrid, GNS/-CD, is highly dispersive in
   various physiological solutions, reflecting the high biostability of
   cyclodextrin. Regarding the host capability, the nanohybrid is fully
   capable of selectively accommodating various biological and functional
   agents in a controlled fashion, including the antivirus drug amantadine,
   fluorescent dye {[}5(6)-carboxyfluorescein], and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)
   peptide-targeting ligands assisted by an adamantine linker. The loading
   ratio of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein is as high as 110\% with a drug

Abstract = {{Typically, when neutron coincidence or multiplicity counting is
   performed, there are three unknowns: the sample mass, the leakage
   self-multiplication, and the ratio of the (alpha,n) rate of the source
   to the spontaneous fission rate. For a given counting time, the strength
   of the source or the detector efficiency must be sufficiently high for
   the singles, doubles, and triples count rates to represent statistically
   meaningful quantities. Often, the strength of the source and the
   allotted counting time are such that only the singles and doubles count
   rates are statistically meaningful. In this latter case, the ratio of
   (alpha,n) to the spontaneous fission must be estimated through some
   other means. With a simulated (alpha,n) rate, the two equations related
   to the singles and doubles count rates can be used to determine the
   sample mass. In order to determine the ratio of (alpha,n) to spontaneous
   fission rate of the source, the isotopic composition of the sample as
   well as the light element impurities inside the source must be known.
   Ideally, there would be a way to dynamically determine the (alpha,n)
   rate of the source from count rate information. In this paper, it is
   shown that the (alpha,n) rate of the source can be determined by using
   information about the ratio of the number of coincident neutrons at 180
   degrees to the number at 90 degrees. By using this information, the
   three aforementioned unknowns can be dynamically determined through the
   sole use of singles and doubles count rates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},

Month = {{FEB 8}},
Abstract = {{Identifying changes in the parameters of a dynamical system can be vital
   in many diagnostic and sensing applications. Sensitivity vector fields
   (SVFs) are one way of identifying such parametric variations by
   quantifying their effects on the morphology of a dynamical system's
   attractor. In many cases, SVFs are a more effective means of
   identification than commonly employed modal methods. Previously, it has
   only been possible to construct SVFs for a given dynamical system when a
   full set of state variables is available. This severely restricts SVF
   applicability because it may be cost prohibitive, or even impossible, to
   measure the entire state in high-dimensional systems. Thus, the focus of
   this paper is constructing SVFs with only partial knowledge of the state
   by using time-delay coordinate embeddings. Local models are employed in
   which the embedded states of a neighborhood are weighted in a way
   referred to as embedded point cloud averaging. Application of the
   presented methodology to both simulated and experimental time series
   demonstrates its utility and reliability. DOI:

Abstract = {{Concerns about the geometric accuracy of MRI in radiation therapy (RT)
   have been present since its invention. Although modern scanners
   typically have system levels of geometric accuracy that meet
   requirements of RT, subject-specific distortion is variable, and methods
   to in vivo assess and control patient-induced geometric distortion are
   not yet resolved. This study investigated the nature and magnitude of
   the subject-induced susceptibility effect on geometric distortions in
   clinical brain MRI, and tested the feasibility of in vivo quality
   control using field inhomogeneity mapping. For 19 consecutive patients
   scanned on a dedicated 3T MR scanner, B0 field inhomogeneity maps were
   acquired and analyzed to determine subject-induced distortions. For 3DT1
   weighted images frequency-encoded with a bandwidth of 180 Hz/pixel,
   86.9\% of the estimated displacements were <0.5 mm, 97.4\% <1 mm, and
   only 0.1\% of displacements > 2 mm. The maximum displacement was <4 mm.
   The greatest distortions were observed at the interfaces with air at the
   sinuses. Displacements decayed to less than 1 mm over a distance of 8
   mm. Metal surgical wires generated smaller distortions, with an averaged
   maximum displacement of 0.76 mm. Repeat acquisition of the field maps in
   17 patients revealed a within-subject standard deviation of 0.25 ppm,
   equivalent to 0.22 mm displacement in the frequency-encoding direction
   in the 3D T1 weighted images. Susceptibility-induced voxel displacements
   in the brain are generally small, but should be monitored for precision
   RT. These effects are manageable at 3T and lower fields, and the methods
   applied can be used to monitor for potential local errors in individual
   patients, as well as to correct for local distortions as needed.}},

Abstract = {{We tested 3 wt\% gold (Au) catalysts on CeO2 ZrO2 mixed oxides, prepared
   by co-precipitation (CP) and the sol-gel (SG) technique, for steam
   reforming of methanol (SRM). Uniform Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solution was
   dependent on the Zr/Ce ratio, where the incorporation of Zr4+ into the
   CO4+ lattice with a ratio of 0.25 resulted in smaller ceria crystallites
   and better reducibility, and was found to be efficient for SRM activity.
   The catalytic activity was suppressed when the ratio was >= 0.5, which
   led to the segregation of Zr from solid solution and sintering of Au
   nanoparticles. It was found that the CP technique produced better
   catalysts than SG in this case. For the bimetallic catalysts, the
   co-operation of Au-Cu supported on Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (CP) exhibited
   superior activities with complete methanol conversion and low CO
   concentration at 350 degrees C. Furthermore, the size of the alloy
   particle was strongly dependent on the pH level during preparation.

Title = {{A mathematical model for incorporating biofeedback into human postural
   control}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biofeedback of body motion can serve as a balance aid and
   rehabilitation tool. To date, mathematical models considering the
   integration of biofeedback into postural control have represented this
   integration as a sensory addition and limited their application to a
   single degree-of-freedom representation of the body. This study has two
   objectives: 1) to develop a scalable method for incorporating
   biofeedback into postural control that is independent of the model's
   degrees of freedom, how it handles sensory integration, and the modeling
   of its postural controller; and 2) to validate this new model using
   multidirectional perturbation experimental results.
   Methods: Biofeedback was modeled as an additional torque to the postural
   controller torque. For validation, this biofeedback modeling approach
   was applied to a vibrotactile biofeedback device and incorporated into a
   two-link multibody model with full-state-feedback control that
   represents the dynamics of bipedal stance. Average response trajectories
   of body sway and center of pressure (COP) to multidirectional surface
   perturbations of subjects with vestibular deficits were used for model
   parameterization and validation in multiple perturbation directions and
   for multiple display resolutions. The quality of fit was quantified
   using average error and cross-correlation values.
   Results: The mean of the average errors across all tactor configurations
   and perturbations was 0.24 degrees for body sway and 0.39 cm for COP.
   The mean of the cross-correlation value was 0.97 for both body sway and
   COP.
   Conclusions: The biofeedback model developed in this study is capable of
   capturing experimental response trajectory shapes with low average
   errors and high cross-correlation values in both the anterior-posterior
   and medial-lateral directions for all perturbation directions and
   spatial resolution display configurations considered. The results
   validate that biofeedback can be modeled as an additional torque to the
   postural controller without a need for sensory reweighting. This novel
   approach is scalable and applicable to a wide range of movement
   conditions within the fields of balance and balance rehabilitation. The
   model confirms experimental results that increased display resolution
   does not necessarily lead to reduced body sway. To our knowledge, this
   is the first theoretical confirmation that a spatial display resolution
   of 180 degrees can be as effective as a spatial resolution of 22.5
   degrees.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, designers of marine propulsors select a discrete number
   of critical design points for which to optimize the propulsor geometry.
   The design procedure carefully weighs the needs to be fuel efficient, to
   minimize cavitation, to maintain structural integrity, and to provide
   enough thrust to reach the desired speed, including the need to overcome
   any resistance humps. The current work proposes a new, alternative
   propulsor-hull matching methodology that is able to systematically
   consider the full range of expected operating conditions. A joint
   probability density function is used to represent the probabilistic
   operational space as a function of ship speed and sea state, and is used
   as a weighting function to select the propulsor that will minimize the
   annual fuel consumption while satisfying a set of constraints. The new
   probabilistic design approach is able to automatically locate the
   globally optimal solution by considering the probability of occurrence
   along with system performance characteristics. Hence, it is able to
   avoid the inherent ambiguity of selecting the proper design points. The
   proposed methodology is general to the design of marine propulsors for
   any type of vessel and engine system. It is applied in the current study
   for the sizing of waterjets for a surface effect ship.}},

Abstract = {{In an automotive production system, material handling is a critical
   activity in terms of increasing system efficiency and reducing overall
   cost. The existing literatures often separate the production system and
   material handling system, and ignore the coupling relations between the
   two systems. In this paper, an integrated modeling approach is developed
   to mathematically describe a dynamic production system including
   production operation and material handling system. A modified max-plus
   algebra based model with ``shifting{''} mechanism is developed to
   overcome the synchronization constraints of traditional max-plus linear
   properties, and adapt to the dynamic change of the system under various
   conditions, such as starvation caused by material handling. The case
   study demonstrates that the new modeling approach is effective and
   efficient (180 times faster comparing with simulation method) in
   real-time system analytics and control to improve productivity and

   2.3-52.0\% of their life cycle energy demands and 74.1-448.4\% of their
   economic costs, respectively. Algae are preferred in the long term
   mainly due to their less arable land demands. Special attention should
   be paid to potential environmental problems accompanying feedstock
   choice: freshwater use, ecotoxicity potentials, photochemical oxidation
   potential, acidification potential and eutrophication potential.
   Moreover, key processes are identified by sensitivity analysis to direct
   future technology improvements. Finally, supporting measures are
   proposed to optimize China's biodiesel development. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{1-24}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The supersonic jet-in-crossflow problem which involves shocks, turbulent
   mixing, and large-scale vortical structures, requires special treatment
   for turbulence to obtain accurate solutions. Different turbulence
   modeling techniques are reviewed and compared in terms of their
   performance in predicting results consistent with the experimental data.
   Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) models are limited in prediction
   of fuel structure due to their inability to accurately capture
   unsteadiness In the flow. Large eddy simulation (LES) is not yet
   practical due to prohibitively large grid requirement near the wall.
   Hybrid RANS/LES can offer reasonable compromise between accuracy and
   efficiency. The hybrid models are based on various approaches such as
   explicit blending of RANS and LES, detached eddy simulation (DES), and
   filter-based multi-scale models. In particular, they can be used to
   evaluate the turbulent Schmidt number modeling techniques used in
   jet-in-crossflow simulations. Specifically, an adaptive approach can be
   devised by utilizing the information obtained from the resolved field to
   help assign the value of turbulent Schmidt number in the sub-filter
   field. The adaptive approach combined with the multi-scale model
   improves the results especially when highly refined grids are needed to
   resolve small structures involved in the mixing process. (C) 2012

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Proton-recoil detectors offer the possibility to unfold fast-neutron
   energy spectra of various sources. However, quantifying the confidence
   of the unfolding methodology is a complex task. In this paper, we
   present a comparative analysis of the maximum-likelihood,
   expectation-maximization (MLEM) method and one-step-late (OSL) method
   for neutron energy spectra unfolding. The analysis is performed on Monte
   Carlo simulated data for several monoenergetic neutron sources and
   continuous-in-energy Cf-252; Am-241-Be and Am-241-Li neutron sources.
   The results obtained for the monoenergetic neutron spectra show that
   both unfolding methods provide results that are in good agreement with
   the reference data. Very good agreement between the unfolded and the
   reference data is achieved for Cf-252, Am-241-Be, and Am-241-Li neutron
   spectra by using the OSL method. In the paper it is demonstrated that
   the MLEM and OSL methods can be applied to accurately unfold the
   simulated pulse-height distributions for organic liquid scintillation
   detectors. Comparative analysis between the two unfolding methods has
   shown that the OSL method has superior unfolding performance than the
   MLEM method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal and spatial tissue temperature profile in electrosurgical
   vessel sealing was experimentally measured and modeled using finite
   element modeling (FEM). Vessel sealing procedures are often performed
   near the neurovascular bundle and may cause collateral neural thermal
   damage. Therefore, the heat generated during electrosurgical vessel
   sealing is of concern among surgeons. Tissue temperature in an in vivo
   porcine femoral artery sealed using a bipolar electrosurgical device was
   studied. Three FEM techniques were incorporated to model the tissue
   evaporation, water loss, and fusion by manipulating the specific heat,
   electrical conductivity, and electrical contact resistance,
   respectively. These three techniques enable the FEM to accurately
   predict the vessel sealing tissue temperature profile. The averaged
   discrepancy between the experimentally measured temperature and the FEM
   predicted temperature at three thermistor locations is less than 7\%.
   The maximum error is 23.9\%. Effects of the three FEM techniques are
   also quantified.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Low-grade noninvasive disease comprises approximately half of
   incident bladder cancer cases. These lesions have exceedingly low rates
   of progression to aggressive, muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and there
   is salient discordance with regard to management recommendations for
   these patients between the principal clinical practice guidelines. In
   this context, we compare the international guidelines with alternative
   surveillance strategies for low-risk bladder cancer patients. Methods.
   We used a partially observable Markov model based on states that defined
   patient risk levels associated with recurrence and progression of
   bladder cancer. The model also included states defining the effects of
   treatment, death from bladder cancer, and all other-cause mortality.
   Simulation was done to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs),
   expected lifelong progression probability, and lifetime number of
   cystoscopies. Results. We compared current international guidelines and
   additional proposed surveillance strategies on the basis of QALYs. We
   conducted a bicriteria analysis to compare expected lifelong progression
   rate v. the number of cystoscopies. One-way sensitivity analysis was
   used to evaluate the influence of model parameters, including a
   patient's disutility associated with cystoscopy, bladder cancer
   mortality, and all other-cause mortality. Conclusions. Age and
   comorbidity significantly affect the optimal surveillance strategy.
   Results suggest that younger patients should be screened more
   intensively than older patients, and patients having comorbidity should
   be screened less intensively.}},

Abstract = {{The goal was to examine the accessibility of la-proprioceptive pathways
   to motoneurons of leg muscles associated with gait in infants with
   Myelomeningocele (MMC). Participants were 15 MMC infants, ages 2-10
   months. We assessed over repeated trials, the tendon reflex (T-reflex),
   vibration-induced inhibition of T-reflex (VIM-T-reflex), and tonic
   vibration-induced reflex (VIR) when computer controlled stimuli were
   applied to the three gait muscles of each leg. Only one third of MMC
   infants exhibited motor responses following the mechanical stimuli with
   sufficient frequency to be judged functioning as in typically developing
   (TD) infants. Age and lesion level were not apparently associated with
   response frequency, but scores on the gross motor portion of the Bayley
   Scale was a reasonable predictor. For those in which responses were
   frequent, the pattern of reciprocal excitation was similar to that of
   age-matched TO infants. 4 of the 10 non-responders who were also tested
   for their responses to being supported on a pediatric treadmill in a
   companion study showed voluntary muscle activity in all three gait
   muscles and a vibration-induced contraction was observed for some of the
   non-responders. la-proprioceptive pathways to homonymous and
   heteronymous muscles are functioning in some MMC babies, but the gain
   setting of these pathways were generally depressed and for many there
   was no evidence that the pathways were intact, although for some group
   more functional stimuli may be needed to elicit responses and experience
   may be needed to enhance the gain on the sensitivity of these neural
   pathways. More research is needed to understand how to optimize outcomes
   via rehabilitation. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation of human movements is an essential component for proactive
   ergonomic analysis and biomechanical model development (Chaffin, 2001).
   Most studies on reach kinematics have described human movements in a
   static environment, however the models derived from these studies cannot
   be applied to the analysis of human reach movements in vibratory
   environments such as in-vehicle operations. This study analyzes
   three-dimensional joint kinematics of the upper extremity in reach
   movements performed in static and specific vibratory conditions and
   investigates vibration transmission to shoulder, elbow, and hand along
   the body path during pointing tasks. Thirteen seated subjects performed
   reach movements to five target directions distributed in their right
   hemisphere. The results show similarities in the characteristics of
   movement patterns and reach trajectories of upper body segments for
   static and dynamic environments. In addition, vibration transmission
   through upper body segments is affected by vibration frequency,
   direction, and location of the target to be reached. Similarities in the
   pattern of movement trajectories revealed by filtering vibration-induced
   oscillations indicate that coordination strategy may not be drastically
   different in static and vibratory environments. This finding may
   facilitate the development of active biodynamic models to predict human
   performance and behavior under whole body vibration exposure.}},
