Abstract = {{In the creation of engineered tissue constructs, the successful
   transport of nutrients and oxygen to the contained cells is a
   significant challenge. In highly porous scaffolds subject to cyclic
   strain, the mechanical deformations can induce substantial fluid
   pressure gradients, which affect the transport of solutes. In this
   article, we describe a poroelastic model to predict the solid and fluid
   mechanics of a highly porous hydrogel subject to cyclic strain. The
   model was validated by matching the predicted penetration of a bead into
   the hydrogel from the model with experimental observations and provides
   insight into nutrient transport. Additionally, the model provides
   estimates of the wall-shear stresses experienced by the cells embedded
   within the scaffold. These results provide insight into the mechanics of
   and convective nutrient transport within a cyclically strained hydrogel,
   which could lead to the improved design of engineered tissues.}},

Abstract = {{For a wing operating under a chord Reynolds-number condition of O(10(4))
   or lower, flow separation often results due to uncertain free-stream
   conditions, such as wind gust. Consequently, aerodynamic performance can
   fluctuate greatly. In this study, we focus on the control of aerodynamic
   forces on a SD7003 airfoil due to free-stream fluctuations at the chord
   Reynolds number of 1000 using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD)
   actuator. In Part 1, based on open-loop flow responses, the Strouhal
   number and reduced frequency of the free-stream unsteadiness
   characterize disturbance regimes: transition of the flow regimes along
   with qualitative changes in lift-drag characteristics, reflecting the
   changes in stall vortex patterns. In parallel, a closed-loop controller
   adopting a penalty-based adaptive law, based on linearized system
   parameter estimates, is also investigated. This combination of minimal
   modeling and adaptive parameterization can suppress substantial
   oscillations in aerodynamic forces. The mitigation of fluctuating forces
   is achieved via two means: modifying wall pressure near the actuator and
   promoting reduced, out-of-phase vortex evolution. These two mechanisms
   combine differently depending on the disturbance regimes. The results
   offer improved understandings of flow physics for developing effective
   control mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in unsteady aerodynamics is to handle uncertain
   free-stream and maintain desired performance. Closed-loop flow control
   provides substantial opportunities to help accomplish this goal.
   Effective control of unsteady aerodynamics can substantially benefit
   from proper pairing of system modeling and control law so that the
   system nonlinearity can be adequately addressed. In this second part of
   the paper, the low-Reynolds number airfoil equipped with the dielectric
   barrier discharge (DBD) actuator is investigated to shed light on both
   flow physics and system dynamics. In this flow regime, combined with
   unsteady free-stream, the evolution of separation bubble can
   significantly influence the force evolution. Specifically, anisotropic
   bubble expansion, namely, rapid bubble spread, is explored and linked to
   the temporal and spatial scales caused by the free-stream disturbances.
   The initiation and duration of the spread as well as bubble's convection
   speed are closely related to the slope and magnitude of the disturbance.
   In addition, two criteria about static stall angle match well with the
   disturbance regimes proposed in the first part of the paper.
   Furthermore, the system's nonlinearity is assessed utilizing parameter
   estimate techniques, suggesting both stall vortex evolution and
   free-vortex shedding stages accompany significant changes in system
   parameter estimates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a review of all existing discrete methods for
   computing the derivatives of computational models within a unified
   mathematical framework. This framework hinges on anew equation, the
   unifying chain rule, from which all the methods can be derived. The
   computation of derivatives is described as a two-step process: the
   evaluation of the partial derivatives and the computation of the total
   derivatives, which are dependent on the partial derivatives. Finite
   differences, the complex-step method, and symbolic differentiation are
   discussed as options for computing the partial derivatives. It is shown
   that these are building blocks with which the total derivatives can be
   assembled using algorithmic differentiation, the direct and adjoint
   methods, and coupled analytic methods for multidisciplinary systems.
   Each of these methods is presented and applied to a common numerical
   example to demonstrate and compare the various approaches. The paper
   ends with a discussion of current challenges and possible future
   research directions in this field.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of aerodynamic forces over flapping wings are challenging
   due to unsteady flowfields and rapidly changing structural loads. This
   represents an important limitation to the aerodynamic data currently
   available to researchers working on the aerodynamics of bioinspired
   flapping wings. This paper proposes the use of pressure-based
   instrumentation for flapping-wing testing and documents the comparison
   of two experimental methods to measure the aerodynamic lift generated
   during the stroke of a rigid flapping wing. The first approach uses a
   force transducer to measure the forces in air and vacuum, and the second
   approach uses pressure measurements taken on the surfaces of the wing.
   The results from both methods are used to validate each other and
   provide experimental data for a test case with easily simulated
   conditions. This paper describes the design of the test hardware
   required, including a custom flap stand, flap mechanics, and
   instrumented wing construction techniques. A series of flap tests were
   conducted with pressures measured only in air and force measurements
   taken both in air and in a vacuum. The data are evaluated with respect
   to noise, repeatability, and expected scaling trends. The pressure
   sensor and force transducer measurement strategies are compared based on
   their accuracy and flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of peripheral propulsive decelerator jets on the
   deceleration performance of Mars entry aeroshells are examined using
   computational fluid dynamics. The study considers a 70 deg blunt-cone
   aeroshell with four peripheral jets in Mach 12 flow of iodine-seeded
   nitrogen gas. Sonic and supersonic peripheral decelerator jets are
   considered in this study. The results show that the peripheral jets
   increase the standoff distance and change the profile of the bow shock
   around the aeroshell. The results also show that decelerator jets
   obstruct the flow around the aeroshell, which creates a low-pressure
   region on the surface behind the jets. The level of obstruction
   increases with thrust, which expands the low-pressure region. As a
   result, the aerodynamic drag coefficient of the aeroshell is inversely
   proportional to the thrust. The jet Mach number, however, has a small
   effect on the deceleration performance, with a maximum difference of
   less than 2\% in the axial force between sonic and supersonic peripheral
   jets. The study also compares the deceleration performance of peripheral
   jets to previously published results for central jets. The results show
   that the peripheral jets provide three to seven times more drag than
   central jets due to higher surface pressures.}},

Title = {{Cavity optomechanics on a microfluidic resonator with water and viscous
   liquids}},
Journal = {{LIGHT-SCIENCE \& APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Currently, optical or mechanical resonances are commonly used in
   microfluidic research. However, optomechanical oscillations by light
   pressure were not shown with liquids. This is because replacing the
   surrounding air with water inherently increases the acoustical impedance
   and hence, the associated acoustical radiation losses. Here, we bridge
   between microfluidics and optomechanics by fabricating a hollow-bubble
   resonator with liquid inside and optically exciting vibrations with 100
   MHz rates using only mW optical-input power. This constitutes the first
   time that any microfluidic system is optomechanically actuated. We
   further prove the feasibility of microfluidic optomechanics on liquids
   by demonstrating vibrations on organic fluids with viscous dissipation
   higher than blood viscosity while measuring density changes in the
   liquid via the vibration frequency shift. Our device will enable using
   cavity optomechanics for studying non-solid phases of matter, while
   light is easily coupled from the outer dry side of the capillary and
   fluid is provided using a standard syringe pump.}},

Title = {{Systematically Differentiating Functions for Alternatively Spliced
   Isoforms through Integrating RNA-seq Data}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Integrating large-scale functional genomic data has significantly
   accelerated our understanding of gene functions. However, no algorithm
   has been developed to differentiate functions for isoforms of the same
   gene using high-throughput genomic data. This is because standard
   supervised learning requires `ground-truth' functional annotations,
   which are lacking at the isoform level. To address this challenge, we
   developed a generic framework that interrogates public RNA-seq data at
   the transcript level to differentiate functions for alternatively
   spliced isoforms. For a specific function, our algorithm identifies the
   `responsible' isoform(s) of a gene and generates classifying models at
   the isoform level instead of at the gene level. Through
   cross-validation, we demonstrated that our algorithm is effective in
   assigning functions to genes, especially the ones with multiple
   isoforms, and robust to gene expression levels and removal of homologous
   gene pairs. We identified genes in the mouse whose isoforms are
   predicted to have disparate functionalities and experimentally validated
   the `responsible' isoforms using data from mammary tissue. With protein
   structure modeling and experimental evidence, we further validated the
   predicted isoform functional differences for the genes Cdkn2a and Anxa6.
   Our generic framework is the first to predict and differentiate
   functions for alternatively spliced isoforms, instead of genes, using
   genomic data. It is extendable to any base machine learner and other
   species with alternatively spliced isoforms, and shifts the current
   gene-centered function prediction to isoform-level predictions.}},

Title = {{Physics-based solar wind driver functions for the magnetosphere:
   Combining the reconnection-coupled MHD generator with the viscous
   interaction}},

Abstract = {{Driver functions for the Earth's magnetosphere-ionosphere system are
   derived from physical principles. Two processes act simultaneously: a
   reconnection-coupled MHD generator G and a viscous interaction. G
   accounts for the dayside reconnection rate, the length of the
   reconnection X line, and current saturation limits for the solar wind
   generator. Two viscous drivers are derived: Bohm viscosity B and the
   freestream-turbulence effect F. A problematic proxy effect is uncovered
   wherein the viscous driver functions also describe the strength of
   reconnection. Two magnetospheric-driver functions written in terms of
   upstream solar wind parameters are constructed: B and B. The driver
   functions are tested against seven geomagnetic indices. The reaction of
   the geomagnetic indices to B and F is nonlinear: Nonlinear versions of
   the driver functions are supplied. Applying the driver functions at
   multiple time steps yields correlation coefficients of similar to 85\%
   with the AE and Kp indices; it is argued that multiple time stepping
   removes high-frequency uncorrelated signal from the drivers.
   Autocorrelation-function analysis shows strong 1 day and 1 year
   periodicities in the AE index, which are not in the solar wind driver
   functions; correspondingly, high-pass and low-pass filtering finds
   uncorrelated signal at 1 day and 1 year timescales. Residuals
   (unpredicted variance) between the geomagnetic indices and the driver
   functions are analyzed: The residuals are anticorrelated with the solar
   wind velocity, the solar F-10.7 radio flux, and the solar wind current
   saturation parameter. Removing diurnal, semiannual, and annual trends
   from the indices improves their correlation with the solar wind driver
   functions. Simplified versions of the driver functions are constructed:
   The simplified drivers perform approximately as well as the full
   drivers.}},

Title = {{Robofurnace: A semi-automated laboratory chemical vapor deposition
   system for high-throughput nanomaterial synthesis and process discovery}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{84}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory research and development on new materials, such as
   nanostructured thin films, often utilizes manual equipment such as tube
   furnaces due to its relatively low cost and ease of setup. However,
   these systems can be prone to inconsistent outcomes due to variations in
   standard operating procedures and limitations in performance such as
   heating and cooling rates restrict the parameter space that can be
   explored. Perhaps more importantly, maximization of research throughput
   and the successful and efficient translation of materials processing
   knowledge to production-scale systems, relies on the attainment of
   consistent outcomes. In response to this need, we present a
   semi-automated lab-scale chemical vapor deposition (CVD) furnace system,
   called ``Robofurnace.{''} Robofurnace is an automated CVD system built
   around a standard tube furnace, which automates sample insertion and
   removal and uses motion of the furnace to achieve rapid heating and
   cooling. The system has a 10-sample magazine and motorized transfer arm,
   which isolates the samples from the lab atmosphere and enables highly
   repeatable placement of the sample within the tube. The system is
   designed to enable continuous operation of the CVD reactor, with
   asynchronous loading/unloading of samples. To demonstrate its
   performance, Robofurnace is used to develop a rapid CVD recipe for
   carbon nanotube (CNT) forest growth, achieving a 10-fold improvement in
   CNT forest mass density compared to a benchmark recipe using a manual
   tube furnace. In the long run, multiple systems like Robofurnace may be
   linked to share data among laboratories by methods such as Twitter. Our
   hope is Robofurnace and like automation will enable machine learning to
   optimize and discover relationships in complex material synthesis
   processes. (c) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{External mechanical stretch plays an important role in regulating
   cellular behaviors through intracellular mechanosensitive and

   structures and focal adhesions (FAs) anchoring the F-actin CSK to the
   extracellular environment. Studying the mechanoresponsive behaviors of
   the F-actin CSK and FAs in response to cell stretch has great importance
   for further understanding mechanotransduction and mechanobiology. In
   this work, we developed a novel cell stretching device combining dynamic
   directional cell stretch with in situ subcellular live-cell imaging.
   Using a cam and follower mechanism and applying a standard mathematical
   model for cam design, we generated different dynamic stretch outputs. By
   examining stretch-mediated FA dynamics under step-function static
   stretch and the realignment of cell morphology and the F-actin CSK under
   cyclic stretch, we demonstrated successful applications of our cell
   stretching device for mechanobiology studies where external stretch
   plays an important role in regulating subcellular molecular dynamics and

Abstract = {{Coverage is one of the fundamental concepts in the design of wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs) in the sense that the monitoring quality of a
   phenomenon depends on the quality of service provided by the sensors in
   terms of how well a field of interest is covered. It enables the sensors
   to detect any event that may occur in the field, thus, meeting the
   application-specific requirements. Several applications require
   k-coverage, where each point in the field is covered by at least k
   sensors, which helps increase data availability to ensure better data
   reliability. Achieving k-coverage of a field of interest becomes a more
   challenging issue in sparsely deployed WSNs. Though the problem of
   coverage in WSNs has been well studied in the literature, only little
   research efforts have been devoted to the case of sparsely deployed
   WSNs. Thus, in this article, we investigate the problem of k-coverage in
   sparse WSNs using static and mobile sensors, which do not necessarily
   have the same communication range, sensing range, and energy supply.
   Precisely, we propose an optimized, generalized framework for k-coverage
   in sparsely deployed WSNs, called k-SCHEMES, which exploits sensor
   heterogeneity and mobility. First, we characterize k-coverage using
   heterogeneous sensors based on Helly's Theorem. Second, we introduce our
   energy-efficient four-tier architecture to achieve mobile k-coverage of
   a region of interest in a field. Third, on top of this architecture, we
   suggest two data-gathering protocols, called direct data-gathering and
   forwarding chain-based data-gathering, using the concept of mobile proxy
   sink. We found that the second data-gathering protocol outperforms the
   first one. For energy-efficient forwarding, we compute the minimum
   transmission distance between any pair of consecutive mobile proxy sinks
   forming the forwarding chain as well as the corresponding optimum number
   of mobile proxy sinks in this chain. We corroborate our analysis with
   several simulation results.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Physical experiments focusing on the propagation of gravity waves of
   finite depth on adverse currents were implemented to examine their
   effect on the development of the modulational instability and to study
   the geometric characteristics of extreme waves. A series of wave trains
   with varying initial steepness, perturbation frequency, and initial
   perturbed strength were mechanically generated in a wave-current flume.
   The present results show that opposing currents can speed the growth of
   the modulational instability, verifying the previous theory
   qualitatively. A current-modified nonlinear Schrodinger equation can
   predict the measured sideband growth rates well for wave trains with
   lower perturbation frequencies, but overestimated those with higher
   perturbation frequencies. On the other hand, the limiting steepness of
   extreme waves measured in the presence of opposing currents was smaller
   than that measured in quiescent water. Additionally, current strength
   was found to have limited influence on the geometric properties of
   extreme waves as well as on their limiting steepness.(C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{For thermo-fluid and safety analyses of a High Temperature Gas-cooled
   Reactor (HTGR), intensive efforts are in progress in the developments of
   the GAMMA+ code of Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) and
   the AGREE code of the University of Michigan (U of M). One of the
   important requirements for GAMMA+ and AGREE is an accurate modeling
   capability of a bypass flow in a prismatic core. Recently, a series of
   air experiments were performed at Seoul National University (SNU) in
   order to understand bypass flow behavior and generate an experimental
   database for the validation of computer codes. The main objective Of the
   present work is to validate the GAMMA+ and AGREE codes using the
   experimental data published by SNU. The numerical results of the two
   codes were compared with the measured data. A good agreement was found
   between the calculations and the measurement. It was concluded that
   GAMMA+ and AGREE can reliably simulate the bypass flow behavior in a
   prismatic core.}},

   rapid and cost-effective response to market changes, and therefore are
   frequently being built by global enterprises. The RMS components are
   Computerized Numerically Controlled (CNC) machines and some
   reconfigurable machines that are all connected into a system in way that
   enables changes in the system structure to accommodate new product types
   and their desired volume. Methodologies for the systematic design for

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Polarization switching in ferroelectric thin films occurs via nucleation
   and growth of 180 degrees domains through a highly inhomogeneous process
   in which the kinetics are largely controlled by defects, interfaces and
   pre-existing domain walls. Here we present the first real-time,
   atomic-scale observations and phase-field simulations of domain
   switching dominated by pre-existing, but immobile, ferroelastic domains
   in Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O-3 thin films. Our observations reveal a novel
   hindering effect, which occurs via the formation of a transient layer
   with a thickness of several unit cells at an otherwise charged interface
   between a ferroelastic domain and a switched domain. This transient
   layer possesses a low-magnitude polarization, with a dipole glass
   structure, resembling the dead layer. The present study provides an
   atomic level explanation of the hindering of ferroelectric domain motion
   by ferroelastic domains. Hindering can be overcome either by applying a
   higher bias or by removing the as-grown ferroelastic domains in
   fabricated nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{The pH impact on reductive dechlorination of cis-dichloroethylene
   (cis-DCE) was investigated using in situ Fe precipitates formed under
   iron-rich sulfate-reducing conditions. The dechlorination rate of
   cis-DCE increased with pH, which was attributed to changes in the
   solid-phase Fe concentration, the composition of Fe minerals, and the
   surface speciation of Fe minerals. With increasing pH, larger quantities
   of Fe minerals, having much greater reactivity than dissolved Fe(II),
   were produced. Fe-K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis of
   Fe precipitates revealed the presence of multiple Fe phases with their
   composition varying with pH. Correlation analyses were performed to
   examine how the solid-phase Fe concentration, the composition of Fe
   minerals, and their surface speciation were linked with the cis-DCE
   dechlorination rate. Such analyses revealed that neither mackinawite
   (FeS) nor magnetite (Fe3O4) was reactive with cis-DCE dechlorination,
   but that Fe (oxyhydr)oxides including green rusts and Fe(OH)(2) were
   reactive. Based on a proposed model of the surface acidity of Fe
   minerals, the increasing deprotonated surface Fe(II) groups with pH
   correlated well with the enhanced cis-DCE dechlorination. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This study reports the development of green lightweight engineered
   cementitious composites (GLECC) with high volume of industrial wastes.
   Three types of industrial wastes including iron ore tailings, fly ash,
   and fly ash cenosphere were used as aggregates, mineral admixture, and
   lightweight filler, respectively, in the production of GLECC. The
   influences of fly ash and fly ash cenosphere contents on the physical,
   mechanical, and thermal properties of GLECC mixtures were experimentally
   investigated. Fly ash cenosphere was most advantageous in reducing the
   density and thermal conductivity, while improving the tensile ductility
   of GLECC with only a slight reduction in compressive strength. The GLECC
   mixtures in this study exhibit density of 1649-1820 kg/m(3), tensile
   strain capacity of 3.3-4.3\%, tensile first cracking strength of 2.5-3.6
   MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 4.8-5.9 MPa, and compressive strength
   of 25.0-47.6 MPa at 28 days, depending on the contents of iron ore
   tailings, fly ash, and fly ash cenosphere. The GLECC mixtures developed
   in this study utilize industrial wastes up to about 89\% by volume of
   total solid matrix materials and weigh under 1850 kg/m(3) (limit for
   lightweight concrete classification); yet their mechanical properties
   are similar to ultra-ductile ECC with added advantage of lower thermal
   conductivity for energy conservation when used as a building material.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel topology for a nonisolated bidirectional
   dc-dc converter with soft-switching capabilities, which usually operates
   at a zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) condition. A nonisolated dc-dc
   converter combines a buck converter and a backward boost converter into
   one circuit, which consists of a half-bridge power switch, an inductor,
   and capacitors. In order to realize ZVS conditions, the proposed
   converter utilizes a coupled inductor, a small independent inductor, and
   auxiliary switches and diodes. Due to ZVS, switching stress on switch
   components is reduced, and the reverse recovery problem of MOSFET
   antiparallel body diodes is also eliminated. Moreover, the operating
   modes of the proposed converter can be switched between a ZVS mode and a
   conventional hard-switching mode on the basis of load conditions. The
   soft-switching mode is for heavy loads, and the hard-switching mode is
   for light-load conditions. Therefore, the highest efficiency can be
   obtained at almost all load ranges. The detailed theoretical analyses in
   each mode are presented, and a 1-kW prototype is also built to verify
   the principle of the circuit and the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A wire grid polarizer (WGP) is fabricated by using a simplified approach
   with a combination of nanoimprint lithography ( NIL) and angled metal
   deposition. The period of the imprinted polymer nanograting used in this
   study is 180 nm. The WGP is formed by two consecutive angled aluminium
   evaporation processes, essentially halving the period for the aluminium
   (Al) nanograting. The fabricated WGP shows good optical properties for
   polarized light. More importantly, because of the slight reduction of
   the period of the nanograting as compared with previous results, the
   viewing angle, which is one of the most important characters in display
   equipment, is extended greatly. Encapsulation of the WGP using poly(
   methyl methacrylate) is conducted for practical application of the WGP.
   The thickness of the coating is controlled to be less than 1 mu m, to
   prevent the degradation of the optical properties of the WGP.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time vision systems require computationally intensive tasks which

   Resistive grid-based analog structures have been shown to perform these

   counterparts. However, these are static structures and can only perform
   one type of image processing task. In this paper, an analog programmable
   memristive grid-based architecture capable of performing various
   real-time image processing tasks such as edge and line detections is
   presented. The unit cell structure employs 3-D confined resonant
   tunneling diodes that are called quantum dots in this paper for signal
   amplification and latching, and these dots are interconnected between
   neighboring cells through nonvolatile continuously variable resistive
   elements that are more popularly known as memristors. A method to
   program memristive connections is introduced and verified through
   circuit simulations. Various diffusion characteristics, edge detection,

Title = {{Space and phase resolved ion energy and angular distributions in single-

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The control of ion energy and angular distributions (IEADs) is
   critically important for anisotropic etching or deposition in
   microelectronic fabrication processes. With single frequency
   capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs), the narrowing in angle and spread
   in energy of ions as they cross the sheath are definable functions of
   frequency, sheath width, and mean free path. With increases in wafer
   size, single frequency CCPs are finding difficulty in meeting the
   requirement of simultaneously controlling plasma densities, ion fluxes,
   and ion energies. Dual-frequency CCPs are being investigated to provide
   this flexible control. The high frequency (HF) is intended to control
   the plasma density and ion fluxes, while the ion energies are intended
   to be controlled by the low frequency (LF). However, recent research has
   shown that the LF can also influence the magnitude of ion fluxes and
   that IEADs are determined by both frequencies. Hence, separate control
   of fluxes and IEADs is complex. In this paper, results from a
   two-dimensional computational investigation of Ar/O-2 plasma properties
   in an industrial reactor are discussed. The IEADs are tracked as a
   function of height above the substrate and phase within the rf cycles
   from the bulk plasma to the presheath and through the sheath with the
   goal of providing insights to this complexity. Comparison is made to
   laser-induced fluorescence experiments. The authors found that the
   ratios of HF/LF voltage and driving frequency are critical parameters in
   determining the shape of the IEADs, both during the transit of the ion
   through the sheath and when ions are incident onto the substrate. To the
   degree that contributions from the HF can modify plasma density, sheath
   potential, and sheath thickness, this may provide additional control for
   the IEADs. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates problems of disease prevention and epidemic
   control (DPEC), in which we optimize two sets of decisions: (i)
   vaccinating individuals and (ii) closing locations, given respective
   budgets with the goal of minimizing the expected number of infected
   individuals after intervention. The spread of diseases is inherently
   stochastic due to the uncertainty about disease transmission and human
   interaction. We use a bipartite graph to represent individuals'
   propensities of visiting a set of location, and formulate two integer
   nonlinear programming models to optimize choices of individuals to
   vaccinate and locations to close. Our first model assumes that if a
   location is closed, its visitors stay in a safe location and will not
   visit other locations. Our second model incorporates compensatory
   behavior by assuming multiple behavioral groups, always visiting the
   most preferred locations that remain open. The paper develops algorithms
   based on a greedy strategy, dynamic programming, and integer
   programming, and compares the computational efficacy and solution
   quality. We test problem instances derived from daily behavior patterns
   of 100 randomly chosen individuals (corresponding to 195 locations) in
   Portland, Oregon, and provide policy insights regarding the use of the
   two DPEC models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Charged domain walls (CDWs) are of significant scientific and
   technological importance as they have been shown to play a critical role
   in controlling the switching mechanism and electric, photoelectric, and
   piezoelectric properties of ferroelectric materials. The atomic scale
   structure and properties of CDWs, which are critical for understanding
   the emergent properties, have, however, been rarely explored. In this
   work, using a spherical-aberration-corrected transmission electron
   microscope with subangstrom resolution, we have found that the
   polarization bound charge of the CDW in rhombohedral-like BiFeO3 thin
   films not only induces the formation of a tetragonal-like crystal
   structure at the CDW but also stabilizes unexpected nanosized domains
   with new polarization states and unconventional domain walls. These
   findings provide new insights on the effects of bound charge on
   ferroelectric domain structures and are critical for understanding the
   electrical switching in ferroelectric thin films as well as in memory
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Chirality of plasmonic films can be strongly enhanced by
   three-dimensional (3D) out-of-plane geometries. The complexity of
   lithographic methods currently used to produce such structures and other
   methods utilizing chiral templates impose limitations on spectral
   windows of chiroptical effects, the size of substrates, and hence,
   further research on chiral plasmonics. Here we demonstrate 3D chiral
   plasmonic nanostructures (CPNs) with high optical activity in the
   visible spectral range based on initially achiral nanopillars from ZnO.
   We made asymmetric gold nanoshells on the nanopillars by vacuum
   evaporation at different inclination and rotation angles to achieve
   controlled symmetry breaking and obtained both left- and right-rotating
   isomers. The attribution of chiral optical effects to monolithic
   enantiomers made in this process was confirmed by theoretical
   calculations based on their geometry established from scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) images. The chirality of the nanoshells is retained
   upon the release from the substrate into a stable dispersion. Deviation
   of the incident angle of light from normal results in increase of
   polarization rotation and chiral g-factor as high as -0.3. This general
   approach for preparation of abiological nanoscale chiral materials can
   be extended to other out-of plane 3D nanostructures. The large area
   films made on achiral nanopillars are convenient for sensors, optical
   devices, and catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Different vertical nanowire heterojunction devices were fabricated and
   tested based on vertical Ge nanowires grown epitaxially at low
   temperatures on (111) Si substrates with a sharp and clean Si/Ge
   interface. The nearly ideal Si/Ge heterojuctions with controlled and
   abrupt doping profiles were verified through material analysis and
   electrical characterizations. In the nSi/pGe heterojunction diode, an
   ideality factor of 1.16, subpicoampere reverse saturation current, and
   rectifying ratio of 10(6) were obtained, while the n+Si/p+Ge structure
   leads to Esaki tunnel diodes with a high peak tunneling current of 4.57
   kA/cm(2) and negative differential resistance at room temperature. The
   large valence band discontinuity between the Ge and Si in the nanowire
   heterojunctions was further verified in the p+Si/pGe structure, which
   shows a rectifying behavior instead of an Ohmic contact and raises an
   important issue in making Ohmic contacts to heterogeneously integrated
   materials. A raised Si/Ge structure was further developed using a
   self-aligned etch process, allowing greater freedom in device design for
   applications such as the tunneling field-effect transistor (TFET). All
   measurement data can be well-explained and fitted with theoretical
   models with known bulk properties, suggesting that the Si/Ge nanowire
   system offers a very clean heterojunction interface with low defect
   density, and holds great potential as a platform for future high-density
   and high-performance electronics.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effectiveness of an atrial septal defect (ASD)
   with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) as a
   bridge to transplantation. Sheep (56 +/- 3 kg; n = 7) underwent a
   right-sided thoracotomy to create the ASD (diameter = 1 cm) and place
   instrumentation and a pulmonary artery (PA) occluder. After recovery,
   animals were placed on ECMO, and the PA was constricted to generate a
   twofold rise in right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure. Sheep were
   then maintained for 60 hours on ECMO, and data were collected hourly.
   Five sheep survived 60 hours. One sheep died because of a circuit clot
   extending into the RV, and another died presumably because of an
   arrhythmia. Mean right ventricular pressure (mRVP) was 19 +/- 3 mm Hg at
   baseline, averaged 27 +/- 7 mm Hg over the experiment, but was not
   statistically significant (p = 0.27) due to one sheep without an
   increase. Cardiac output was 6.8 +/- 1.2 L/min at baseline, averaged 6.0
   +/- 1.0 L/min during the experiment, and was statistically unchanged (p
   = 0.34). Average arterial oxygen saturation and PCO2 over the experiment
   were 96.8 +/- 1.4\% and 31.8 +/- 3.4 mm Hg, respectively. In conclusion,
   an ASD combined with vv-ECMO maintains normal systemic hemodynamics and
   arterial blood gases during a long-term increase in RV afterload.}},

Title = {{Experimental Investigation of the Effect of Fibrous Reinforcement on
   Shear Resistance of Soil-Waste Mixtures}},

Abstract = {{The effect of fibrous waste reinforcement on the shear resistance of
   soil-waste mixtures is experimentally investigated using a large (30 cm
   x 30 cm x 18 cm) direct shear box. Analogies in shear response to
   fiber-reinforced soils (FRS) are identified. Specimens are reconstituted
   at varying fibrous waste orientations using a custom-made specimen
   preparation split mold. Tests on soil-waste mixtures with waste fibrous
   constituents, i.e., paperboard, plastic and wood, commonly encountered
   in municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills are performed. Fibrous
   constituents are characterized by performing tensile tests and interface
   testing. The experimental data confirms that the shearing response of
   soil-waste mixtures is analogous to that of FRS and provides a basis for
   explaining the fiber reinforcement effect of MSW. It was found that the
   presence of fibrous constituents results in significant anisotropy in
   shear resistance of the direct shear specimens with fiber reinforcement
   contribution being a function of the reinforcement orientation and the
   type of fiber. The impact of reinforcement orientation on the shear
   strength of the specimens is significant. The largest increase in shear
   resistance of the specimens is observed for a reinforcement angle of 60
   degrees with respect to the shear plane, consistent with findings of
   previous studies on FRS. Wood fibers exhibit the highest tensile
   strength and the lowest strain at failure as well as the highest
   interface strength with soil, compared to paperboard and plastic fibers.
   Wood fibers also contribute the most to the shear resistance of
   soil-waste mixtures. For these mixtures, similarly to FRS, once the
   amount of reinforcement exceeds a certain threshold, it does not
   contribute further to reinforcement. Results of this investigation
   indicate that the previously recommended strength envelopes for MSW may
   not account for the significant fibrous reinforcement effect, although
   lower shear resistances may be observed in direct shear when shearing
   occurs parallel to plastic fibrous constituents.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents planar near-field plates that can tailor the
   electromagnetic near field and produce desired subwavelength focal
   patterns. These plates consist of concentric annular slots on a circular
   grounded dielectric slab excited through a coaxial connector. The
   annular slots are loaded with lumped element impedances which are
   designed to produce a prescribed subwavelength focal pattern. The
   procedure to design such plates is outlined. The designed plates are
   studied through full-wave simulation and the generation of desired
   subwavelength patterns is demonstrated. Several near-field plates are
   also fabricated and measured. It is shown that the experimental
   near-field patterns are in close agreement with simulation. Furthermore,
   experiments confirming the planar near-field plates ability to tailor
   the electromagnetic near field are presented. Planar near field plates
   may find application in near-field imaging and probing systems,
   biomedical targeting devices, and high density data storage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the advantages offered by radiation pattern
   diversity using a new physics-based analysis that takes into account the
   complex radiation patterns of the transmit(Tx) and receive(Rx) diversity
   antennas in conjunction with an accurate deterministic, coherent, and
   polarization preserving propagation model for a complex indoor scenario.
   Unlike techniques that utilize spatial diversity, radiation pattern
   diversity offers a unique opportunity to achieve compact diversity
   antenna systems especially with the advent of enabling antenna
   miniaturization techniques. In this work, a co-located antenna radiation
   pattern diversity system is proposed and its performance is analyzed
   using an accurate physics-based diversity analysis technique. The
   proposed analysis technique utilizes an efficient deterministic
   propagation model modified by incorporating the complex gain of the Tx
   and the complex effective heights of the Rx antennas into the rays
   launched and received by the antennas in a coherent manner. The proposed
   system is realized and tested in complex indoor scenarios based on which
   complex correlation coefficients between various channels and the
   effective diversity gain are computed which are then utilized as a
   figure of merit for improved channel reliability. For the scenarios
   considered, it is shown that the apparent diversity gain is at least 9.4
   dB based on measured results.}},

Abstract = {{An audio recording is subject to a number of possible distortions and
   artifacts. Consider, for example, artifacts due to acoustic
   reverberation and background noise. The acoustic reverberation depends
   on the shape and the composition of the room, and it causes temporal and
   spectral smearing of the recorded sound. The background noise, on the
   other hand, depends on the secondary audio source activities present in
   the evidentiary recording. Extraction of acoustic cues from an audio
   recording is an important but challenging task. Temporal changes in the
   estimated reverberation and background noise can be used for dynamic
   acoustic environment identification (AEI), audio forensics, and
   ballistic settings. We describe a statistical technique based on
   spectral subtraction to estimate the amount of reverberation and
   nonlinear filtering based on particle filtering to estimate the
   background noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested
   using a data set consisting of speech recordings of two human speakers
   (one male and one female) made in eight acoustic environments using four
   commercial grade microphones. Performance of the proposed method is
   evaluated for various experimental settings such as microphone
   independent, semi-and full-blind AEI, and robustness to MP3 compression.
   Performance of the proposed framework is also evaluated using Temporal
   Derivative-based Spectrum and Mel-Cepstrum (TDSM)-based features.
   Experimental results show that the proposed method improves AEI
   performance compared with the direct method (i.e., feature vector is
   extracted from the audio recording directly). In addition, experimental
   results also show that the proposed scheme is robust to MP3 compression
   attack.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the study of a single-stage onboard battery charger
   for electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV) applications. The
   topology had never been seen in any literature or patents but is
   employed in the NLG5 charger made by Brusa Elektronik AG. We thoroughly
   analyzed the topology and thought it would be beneficial to publish it
   so that advanced work can be done based on the existing structure. The
   charger directly transfers power from the alternating current (ac) to
   the battery side; thus, the bulky electrolytic capacitor in a
   traditional two-stage charger is eliminated. Power factor correction
   (PFC) is inherently achieved; thus, the control becomes very simple. In
   addition, all the power switches work at a zero-current switching (ZCS)
   condition to reduce the switching loss. The charger charges the battery
   with a sinusoidal-like charging current instead of a constant direct
   current. However, this current waveform has minimal impact on the
   battery life and efficiency, as demonstrated by other studies. Hence,
   having the advantages of high efficiency, compact size, easy control,
   and no need of an electrolytic capacitor, the topology is suitable for
   the PHEV and the pure EV onboard charging applications.}},

Abstract = {{Tristetraprolin (TTP) is an RNA-binding protein which downregulates
   multiple cytokines that mediate progression of head and neck squamous
   cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We previously showed that HNSCC cells with
   shRNA-mediated knockdown of TTP are more invasive than controls. In this
   study, we use control and TTP-deficient cells to present a novel
   subsurface non-linear optical molecular imaging method using a
   three-dimensional (3D) organotypic construct, and compare the live cell
   imaging data to histology of fixed tissue specimens. This manuscript
   describes how to prepare and image the novel organotypic system that
   closely mimics HNSCC in a clinical setting. The oral cancer equivalent
   (OCE) system allows HNSCC cells to stratify and invade beyond the
   basement membrane into underlying connective tissue prepared from
   decellularized human dermal tissue. The OCE model was inspired by tissue
   engineering strategies to prepare autologous transplants from human
   keratinocytes. Advantages of this method over previously used in vitro
   cancer models include the simulation of the basement membrane and
   complex connective tissue in the construct, in addition to the ability
   to track the 3D movement of live invading cells and quantify matrix
   destruction over time. The OCE model and novel live cell imaging
   strategy may be applied to study other types of 3D tissue constructs.}},

   explore the functional and security requirements for these new systems,
   such as availability, security, and privacy, and present several design
   options for building secure encounter-based social networks. To
   highlight these challenges, we examine one recently proposed
   encounter-based social network design and compare it to a set of
   idealized security and functionality requirements. We show that it is
   vulnerable to several attacks, including impersonation, collusion, and
   privacy breaching, even though it was designed specifically for
   security. Mindful of the possible pitfalls, we construct a flexible
   framework for secure encounter-based social networks, which can be used
   to construct networks that offer different security, privacy, and
   availability guarantees. We describe two example constructions derived
   from this framework, and consider each in terms of the ideal
   requirements. Some of our new designs fulfill more requirements in terms
   of system security, reliability, and privacy than previous work. We also
   evaluate real-world performance of one of our designs by implementing a
   proof-of-concept iPhone application called MeetUp. Experiments highlight
   the potential of our system and hint at the deployability of our designs
   on a large scale.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical image reconstruction algorithms in X-ray computed tomography
   (CT) provide improved image quality for reduced dose levels but require
   substantial computation time. Iterative algorithms that converge in few
   iterations and that are amenable to massive parallelization are
   favorable in multiprocessor implementations. The separable quadratic
   surrogate (SQS) algorithm is desirable as it is simple and updates all
   voxels simultaneously. However, the standard SQS algorithm requires many
   iterations to converge. This paper proposes an extension of the SQS
   algorithm that leads to spatially nonuniform updates. The nonuniform
   (NU) SQS encourages larger step sizes for the voxels that are expected
   to change more between the current and the final image, accelerating
   convergence, while the derivation of NU-SQS guarantees monotonic
   descent. Ordered subsets (OS) algorithms can also accelerate SQS,
   provided suitable ``subset balance{''} conditions hold. These conditions
   can fail in 3-D helical cone-beam CT due to incomplete sampling outside
   the axial region-of-interest (ROI). This paper proposes a modified OS
   algorithm that is more stable outside the ROI in helical CT. We use CT
   scans to demonstrate that the proposed NU-OS-SQS algorithm handles the
   helical geometry better than the conventional OS methods and
   ``converges{''} in less than half the time of ordinary OS-SQS.}},

Abstract = {{We present results of an experimental study of buoyant miscible
   displacement flows of a yield-stress fluid (Carbopol) by a higher
   density Newtonian fluid along a long inclined pipe. We focus on the
   industrially interesting case where the yield stress is significantly
   larger than a typical viscous stress in the displacing fluid, but where
   buoyancy forces may be significant. We find that the slump and
   centre-type displacements identified in our earlier work on
   near-horizontal flows are in fact observed over the full range of pipe
   inclinations. Interestingly, the occurrence of these regimes is
   primarily governed by approximately the same ratio of Reynolds number to
   densimetric Froude number, Re/Fr, as in near-horizontal case. However,
   we do observe a range of exotic behaviour for slump flows at higher
   inclinations associated with the progressive break-up of the Carbopol
   layer. We give a detailed description of these secondary regimes and
   their formation. We also observe a third regime which we refer to as
   turbulent-mixed flow. In this case, despite the existence of the yield
   stress, the flow is very similar to that for a Newtonian displacement
   when the mixing is very efficient. In the absence of an imposed flow of
   the displacing fluid, we observe that flows may nonetheless develop
   under the action of buoyancy despite the yield stress. We discuss the
   probable mechanisms and potential implications for the plug cementing
   process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the sedimentation of a sphere in a viscoelastic fluid
   with a cross-shear flow by numerical simulation. The non-Newtonian
   properties of the suspending fluid determine the settling rate of the
   sphere. Experiments {[}Tonmukayakul et al., US Patent Number
   US8,024,962(B2) (2010); van den Brule and Gheissary, J. Non-Newton.
   Fluid Mech. 49 (1993) 123-132] have shown the settling rate increases
   with increase in cross-shear Weissenberg number, Wi, in elastic guar gum
   solutions and decreases in Boger fluids. In the present work,
   simulations of a sheared viscoelastic flow past a sphere are used to
   study the effect of the shear-thinning and elasticity of the carrying
   fluid on the sphere's settling rate. The elastic guar gum solutions are
   modeled using the Giesekus constitutive model. The parameters are
   obtained by fitting the rheological data. The drag on the sphere
   decreases, i.e. the settling rate increases, with an increase in the
   shear Weissenberg number that is in qualitative agreement with the
   experiments. The decrease in the drag is primarily due to the decrease
   in the polymer drag component because of shear-thinning. This is in
   contrast with the increase in the drag in Boger fluids due to the
   increase in viscous drag. The effect of different polymer
   characteristics such as shear thinning and elasticity on the flow field
   is presented. There is an optimum value for the amount of polymers in
   the solution for the increase in the viscous drag to overcome the
   decrease in the polymer drag leading to a net increase in the drag on
   the sphere. The effect of walls on the drag coefficients in Boger fluids
   is also investigated. It is demonstrated that the effect of the increase
   in the drag coefficients with Wi is accentuated as the interaction with
   the wall grows stronger. The wall interactions lead to an increase in
   viscous shear stresses downstream of the sphere, which causes the
   increase in the drag. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe a new
   computer-controlled research apparatus for measuring in vivo uterine
   ligament force-displacement behavior and stiffness and to present pilot
   data for women with and without prolapse.
   STUDY DESIGN: Seventeen women with varying uterine support underwent
   testing in the operating room (OR) after anesthetic induction. A
   tripod-mounted computer-controlled linear servoactuator was used to
   quantify force-displacement behavior of the cervix and supporting
   ligaments. The servoactuator applied a caudally directed force to a
   tenaculum at 4 mm/sec velocity until the traction force reached 17.8 N
   (4 lbs). Cervix location on Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system
   (POP-Q) in the clinic, in the OR, at rest, and with minimal force (<1.1
   N); maximum force (17.8 N) was recorded. Ligament ``stiffness{''}
   between minimum and maximum force was calculated.
   RESULTS: The mean +/- SD subject age was 54.5 +/- 12.7 years; parity was
   2.9 +/- 1.1; body mass index was 29.0 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2), and POP-Q point C
   was -3.1 +/- 3.9 cm. POP-Q point C was correlated most strongly with
   cervix location at maximum force (r = +0.68; P = .003) and at rest (r =
   +0.62; P = .009). Associations between cervix location at minimum force
   (r = +0.46; P = .059) and ligament stiffness (r = -0.44; P = .079) were
   not statistically significant. Cervix location in the OR with minimal
   traction lay below the lowest point found on POP-Q for 13 women.
   CONCLUSION: POP-Q point C was correlated strongly with cervix location
   at rest and at maximum traction force; however, only 19\% of the
   variation in POP-Q point C location was explained by ligament stiffness.
   The cervix location in the OR at minimal traction lay below POP-Q point
   C value in three-fourths of the women.}},

Abstract = {{In this manuscript a series of cubic silsequioxane monomers with their
   eight vertices functionalized by different organic tethers and
   terminated with triethoxysilane groups were acid hydrolyzed, spin cast,
   and vitrified into hard organosilicate films. Both the length of the
   organic ligands and the number of triethoxysilane groups were varied to
   change the degree of cross-linking and cubic silsequioxane content of
   the vitrified films. This resulted in a series of high-quality
   optical-grade coatings with excellent properties. In general, higher
   concentrations of the cubic silsequioxane moiety in the network and
   higher cross-link densities led to enhanced mechanical properties, lower
   porosity, higher density, lower thermal expansion, and a very
   hydrophilic surface. The manner by which these properties can be tuned
   via the cubic silsesquioxane content is discussed in comparison to the
   structure-property relations for other spin on silsequioxane type films.

Abstract = {{There is continuing interest in the synthesis of polyhydroxy-terminated
   molecular species for diverse applications ranging from
   photolithographic materials to intermediates in the synthesis of porous,
   crosslinked polymers as media for molecular separations, drug delivery
   etc. We describe here the use of {[}vinylSiO(1.5)](8) and
   {[}vinylSiO(1.5)](10/12) mixtures to synthesize first- and
   second-generation acetoxyphenyl compounds via metathesis with
   p-acetoxystyrene (generation 1, GEN1) or metathesis with p-bromostyrene
   followed by Heck coupling with p-acetoxystyrene (generation 2, GEN2).
   The resulting acetoxy compounds were then hydrolyzed to produce octa-,
   deca- and dodecahydroxy GEN1 and GEN2 compounds. These compounds were
   purified and then reacted with adipic acid chloride to form the first
   examples of highly crosslinked polyesters based on silsesquioxanes. The
   coupling products, their hydrolyzed products and the crosslinked
   polymers were characterized using a variety of spectroscopic methods. In
   general, the observed specific surface areas were less than 5m(2)g(-1);
   however, the T-8 GEN1 derivative gave a surface area of 25m(2)g(-1) and
   was the only crosslinked polymer with a TGA ceramic yield that matched
   theory for perfect' crosslinking. This crosslinked polyester has the
   shortest organic linker between cages and despite the highly flexible
   C-6 linker provides continuing evidence that it is possible to use the
   cubic symmetry in these materials to build well-ordered 3-D
   nanocomposite structures. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The chemokine CXCL12 and its shared seven-transmembrane receptors CXCR4
   and CXCR7 regulate diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis,
   autoimmunity, and HIV infection, making these molecules promising drug
   targets. These molecules also control key processes in normal
   development and physiology, suggesting the need to selectively modulate
   CXCR4 and/or CXCR7 functions and signaling to reduce potential
   complications of long-term therapy. We previously identified two
   peptides that functioned as allosteric agonists driving CXCR4-dependent
   chemotaxis, providing key structural information to design a small
   number of additional peptides to investigate determinants of CXCL12
   interactions and signaling through CXCR4 and CXCR7. In the current
   study, we show that the previously identified peptides only minimally
   activated CXCR4 signaling through the cytosolic adapter protein
   beta-arrestin 2 and do not initiate signaling to ERK1/2. By comparison,
   peptides with diverse N-terminal amino acid sequences effectively
   activated CXCR7 signaling to beta-arrestin 2. One peptide, designated as
   GSLW based on its N-terminal amino acids, activated CXCR7 signaling and
   potentiated CXCL12-CXCR7 signaling without blocking the scavenger
   function of CXCR7 to internalize CXCL12. These results advance our
   understanding of CXCR7 ligand recognition and signaling, and provide
   structural information to target allosteric binding sites on this
   receptor as chemical probes and potential therapeutic agents. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A fully integrated broadband power amplifier (PA) is implemented in a
   standard 45-nm CMOS SOI technology. The PA is designed using a
   dynamically biased stacked SOI transistor approach, which constructively
   adds drain-source voltage signals of individual transistors while
   keeping their gate voltages within source and drain voltage limits. The
   design overcomes both low gate-oxide breakdown and low source-drain
   reachthrough voltages of nanoscale CMOS transistors. The number, size,
   and topology of transistors in the stack are optimized to deliver a
   relatively high linear output power over a wide range of frequencies.
   The amplifier under a supply voltage of 4.5 V measures a flat gain of 6
   dB with -1-dB bandwidth of 6 to 26.5 GHz (X-band to K-band). At 18 GHz,
   the PA under a supply voltage of 7.2 V measures a saturated output power
   (P-SAT) of 26.1 dBm (similar to 400 mW), a linear output power (P-1 dB)
   of 22.5 dBm, and a peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 11\%. With a
   lower power supply voltage of 4.5 V, the PAE increases to more than 20\%
   and stays above 17\% with relatively constant P-SAT and P-1 dB for
   several measured frequencies in the range of 6 to 20 GHz. The PA
   occupies an active chip area of only 0.16 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{Mixed convection flow and heat transfer characteristics in a lid-driven
   cavity with a circular body inside are studied numerically using a
   finite element formulation based on the Galerkin method of weighted
   residuals. Comparisons of streamlines, isotherms and average Nusselt
   number are presented to show the impact of the Richardson number,
   non-dimensional radius of the cylinder, and the location of the cylinder
   on the transport phenomena within the cavity. The results of this
   investigation show that the presence of the cylinder results in an
   increase in the average Nusselt number compared with a case with no
   cylinder. This result is observed for both, an adiabatic and isothermal,
   boundary condition imposed on the cylinder. The average Nusselt number
   increases with an increase in the Richardson number for all
   non-dimensional radius of the cylinder studied in this work. Moreover,
   the optimal heat transfer results are obtained when placing the cylinder
   near the bottom wall for various Richardson numbers. For dominant
   natural convection (Ri >= 2.5), the average Nusselt number increases
   with an increase in the non-dimensional radius for 0.05 < r(0)/H < 0.2.
   Further increase in the non-dimensional radius does not change the
   Nusselt number at a particular Ri. For dominant mixed convection, the
   average Nusselt number increases with an increase in the radius of the
   cylinder for various Richardson numbers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this study, a comprehensive analytical model is established based on
   Euler-Bernoulli beam theory with von Karman geometric nonlinearity to
   investigate the effect of residual surface tension, surface elasticity,
   and temperature on the static pull-in voltages of multi-layer graphene
   nanoribbon (MLGNR) doubly-clamped beams under electrostatic and Casimir
   forces and axial residual stress. An explicit closed-form analytical
   solution to the governing fourth-order nonlinear differential equation
   of variable coefficients is presented for the static pull-in behavior of
   electrostatic nanoactuators using a Fredholm integral equation of the
   first kind. The high accuracy of the present analytical model is
   validated for some special cases through comparison with other existing
   numerical, analytical, and experimental models. The effects of the
   number of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), temperature, surface tension, and
   surface elasticity on the pull-in voltage and displacement of MLGNR
   electrostatic nanoactuaotrs are investigated. Results indicate that the
   thermal effect on the pull-in voltage is significant especially when a
   smaller number of GNRs are used. It is found that the surface effects
   become more dominant as the number of GNRs decreases. It is also
   demonstrated that the residual surface tension exerts a greater
   influence on the pull-in voltage in comparison with the surface
   elasticity.}},

Pages = {{644-651}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{While clean vehicles (i.e., vehicles powered by alternative fuels other
   than fossil fuels) offer great potential to reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions from gasoline-based vehicles, the associated impact on water
   resources has not yet been fully assessed. This research provides a
   systematic evaluation of the impact of a fully implemented clean vehicle
   system on national and state-level water demand and water stress. On the
   national level, based on existing policies, transitioning the current
   gasoline-based transportation into one with clean vehicles will increase
   national annual water consumption by 1950-2810 billion gallons of water,
   depending on the market penetration of electric vehicles. On the state
   level, variances of water efficiency in producing different fuels are
   significant. The fuel choice for clean vehicle development is especially
   crucial for minimizing water stress increase in states with already high
   water stress, high travel demands, and significant variations in water
   efficiency in producing different alternative fuels. Current development
   of clean vehicle infrastructure, however, has not reflected these
   state-level variations. This study takes an optimization approach to
   further evaluate impacts on state-level water stress from a fully
   implemented clean vehicle system and identified potential roles (fuel
   producer or consumer) states may play in real world clean vehicle
   development scenario. With an objective of minimizing overall water
   stress impact, our optimization model aims to provide an analytical
   framework to better assess impacts on state-level water resources due to
   clean vehicle deployment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biological oxidation of methane to methanol by aerobic bacteria is
   catalysed by two different enzymes, the cytoplasmic or soluble methane
   monooxygenase (sMMO) and the membrane-bound or particulate methane
   monooxygenase (pMMO). Expression of MMOs is controlled by a
   copper-switch', i.e. sMMO is only expressed at very low copper:biomass
   ratios, while pMMO expression increases as this ratio increases.
   Methanotrophs synthesize a chalkophore, methanobactin, for the binding
   and import of copper. Previous work suggested that methanobactin was
   formed from a polypeptide precursor. Here we report that deletion of the
   gene suspected to encode for this precursor, mbnA, in Methylosinus
   trichosporiumOB3b, abolishes methanobactin production. Further, gene
   expression assays indicate that methanobactin, together with another
   polypeptide of previously unknown function, MmoD, play key roles in
   regulating expression of MMOs. Based on these data, we propose a general
   model explaining how expression of the MMO operons is regulated by
   copper, methanobactin and MmoD. The basis of the copper-switch' is MmoD,
   and methanobactin amplifies the magnitude of the switch. Bioinformatic
   analysis of bacterial genomes indicates that the production of
   methanobactin-like compounds is not confined to methanotrophs,
   suggesting that its use as a metal-binding agent and/or role in gene
   regulation may be widespread in nature.}},

Abstract = {{The recent combination of scanning electron microscopy and digital image
   correlation (SEM-DIC) enables the experimental investigation of
   full-field deformations at much smaller length scales than is possible
   using optical digital image correlation methods. However, the high
   spatial resolution of SEM-DIC comes at the cost of complex image
   distortions, long image scan times that can capture gradients from
   stress relaxation, and a high noise sensitivity to SEM parameters. In
   this paper, it is shown that these sources of error can significantly
   impact the quality of the results and must be accounted for in order to
   perform accurate SEM-DIC experiments. An existing framework for
   distortion corrections is adapted to improve accuracy and the procedures
   are described in detail. As the results demonstrate, time varying drift
   distortion is a larger problem at high magnification while spatial
   distortion is more problematic at low magnification. Additionally, the
   new use of sample-independent calibration and a method to eliminate the
   detrimental effects of stress relaxation in the displacement fields
   prior to distortion correction are introduced. The impact of SEM
   settings on image noise is quantified and noise minimization schemes are
   examined. Finally, a uniaxial tension test on coarse-grained 1100-O
   aluminum is used to demonstrate these techniques, where active slip
   planes are identified and strain localization is examined in relation to
   the underlying microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound-guided core biopsy provides many benefits compared with
   fine-needle aspiration cytology and has begun to emerge as part of the
   diagnostic work-up for a salivary gland lesion. Although the increased
   potential for tumor-seeding and capsule rupture has been extensively
   discussed, the safety of this procedure is widely accepted based on
   infrequent reports of tumor-seeding. In fact, a review of the literature
   shows only 2 cases of salivary tumor seeding following biopsy with
   larger-gauge needle characteristics, with 2 reported cases of salivary
   tumor seeding following fine-needle aspiration cytology. However, the
   follow-up interval of such studies (<7 years) is substantially less than
   the 20-year follow-up typically necessary to detect remote recurrence.
   Studies on tumor recurrence of pleomorphic adenoma, the most common
   salivary gland lesion, suggest that as many as 16\% of tumor recurrences
   occur at least 10 years following initial surgery, with average time to
   recurrence ranging anywhere from 6.1 to 11.8 years postoperatively.
   Despite the benefits of ultrasound-guided core biopsy over fine-needle
   aspiration biopsy, which include both improved consistency and
   diagnostic accuracy, current studies lack adequate patient numbers and
   follow-up duration to confirm comparable safety profile to currently
   accepted fine-needle aspiration cytology. In this report we: (1) compare
   the relative benefits of each procedure, (2) review evidence regarding
   tumor seeding in each procedure, (3) discuss time course and patient
   numbers necessary to detect tumor recurrence, and (4) describe how these
   uncertainties should be factored into clinical considerations. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{We evaluate the performance of an opportunistic multi-channel medium
   access control protocol and compare it to that of the corresponding
   single-channel MAC (S-MAC) and a non-opportunistic multi-channel MAC
   (M-MAC). We do this in three different settings: (1) an ideal scenario
   where no control channel is used and no sensing delay is incurred, (2) a
   more realistic scheme where users compete for access on a control
   channel using random access, and (3) a scheme similar to (2) but with a
   time-division multiplexing (TDM) based access scheme on the control
   channel. Our analysis and numerical results show that in terms of delay
   performance, the random access and competition on the control channel,
   which typically occupy a fraction of the total bandwidth, almost always
   wipe out the channel diversity gain, a main motivation behind an
   opportunistic multi-channel MAC. On the other hand opportunistic access
   increases bandwidth utilization which reduces the system's total busy
   time. As a result it helps reduce power consumption in general. When TDM
   is employed on the control channel, the data sub-channel sensing delay
   becomes the main bottleneck to attaining better performance. In this
   case the performance of opportunistic multi-channel MAC gets closer to
   that of the single-channel MAC when the channel sensing overhead is
   substantially reduced.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the ergodic sum capacity of a spectrum-shared
   Multiple Access Channel (MAC). We assume that the secondary service (SS)
   only knows the channel distribution information (CDI) between its
   transmitters and the primary receivers. Availability of CDI results in
   collision incidences at the primary receivers because of conflicting
   levels of intolerable interference. We introduce the concept of
   collision probability constraint to manage the unexpected QoS
   degradation of primary service in the secondary resource allocation
   (RA). This RA problem is inherently difficult to solve and its objective
   function is not necessarily convex. Two well-known approaches, called
   Iterative Approach (IA) and Analytical Approach (AA), each with several
   cases/categories, are then used to find solutions. IA solves the problem
   iteratively by reconstructing convex optimization problems from the
   original (non-convex) one in a number of iterative loops until the
   collision probability constraints are satisfied. IA is shown to converge
   quickly to a suitable solution. Furthermore, by using a control
   parameter, the system designer can make a tradeoff between the speed of
   convergence and the ergodic sum capacity. AA, on the other hand, solves
   the RA problem by suggesting tractable versions of collision probability
   constraints. Unlike IA, AA does not require extra signaling between
   transmitters and the base station to tune parameters, thus facilitating
   the implementation of SS. Our in-depth simulations have shown the
   proposed approach to yield lower spectral efficiency than IA.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new class of parameter estimation methods for log-linear
   models. Our approach relies on the fact that minimizing a rational
   function of mixtures of exponentials is equivalent to minimizing a
   difference of convex functions. This allows us to construct convex
   auxiliary functions by applying the concave-convex procedure (CCCP). We
   consider a modification of CCCP where a proximal term is added
   (ProxCCCP), and extend it further by introducing an l(1) penalty. For
   solving the `convex + l(1)' auxiliary problem, we propose an approach
   called SeqGPSR that is based on sequential application of the GPSR
   procedure. We present convergence analysis of the algorithms, including
   sufficient conditions for convergence to a critical point of the
   objective function. We propose an l(1) adaptive procedure for varying
   the strength of the proximal regularization term in each ProxCCCP
   iteration, and show this procedure (AProxCCCP) is effective in practice
   and stable under some mild conditions. The CCCP procedure and proposed
   variants are applied to the task of optimizing the cross-entropy
   objective function for an audio frame classification problem. Class
   posteriors are modeled using log-linear models consisting of
   approximately 6 million parameters. Our results show that CCCP variants
   achieve a much better cross-entropy objective value as compared to
   direct optimization of the objective function by a first order gradient
   based approach, stochastic gradient descent or the L-BFGS procedure.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{131-141}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In construction, about 80\%-90\% of accidents are associated with
   workers' unsafe acts. Nevertheless, the measurement of workers' behavior
   has not been actively applied in practice, due to the difficulties in
   observing workers on jobsites. In an effort to provide a robust and
   automated means for worker observation, this paper proposes a framework
   of vision-based unsafe action detection for behavior monitoring. The
   framework consists of (1) the identification of critical unsafe
   behavior, (2) the collection of relevant motion templates and site
   videos, (3) the 3D skeleton extraction from the videos, and (4) the
   detection of unsafe actions using the motion templates and skeleton
   models. For a proof of concept, experimental studies are undertaken to
   detect unsafe actions during ladder climbing (i.e., reaching far to a

Abstract = {{As worldwide energy and environmental pressures increase, interest in
   biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol, and low emission diesel
   combustion modes such as premixed low temperature combustion (LTC),
   continues to grow. This study takes a detailed look at particulate
   matter (PM) from a single cylinder common rail diesel engine operated
   under conventional and premixed LTC combustion modes with diesel,
   biodiesel and biodiesel-ethanol fuels. Soot, particle number and
   particle size distribution are investigated.
   Experiments show that for conventional combustion, accumulation mode
   particulates are reduced by biodiesel and reduced further by
   biodiesel-E20 (20\% ethanol by volume). The reduction is attributed to
   higher fuel oxygen content, lower stoichiometric air-fuel ratio and
   reduced aromatic content reducing carbonaceous soot. Nucleation mode
   particles from conventional combustion with diesel, biodiesel and
   biodiesel-E20 fuels show similar size distributions.
   For premixed LTC, biodiesel shifts the accumulation mode size
   distribution curve upwards (i.e., more particles) and towards smaller
   size particles relative to diesel. In LTC, biodiesel produces more
   semi-volatile organic carbon and lower soot. The shift in size
   distribution for biodiesel may be caused by more semi-volatile organic
   carbon in the exhaust causing an increase in the growth of particles
   nucleated from volatile species, and less soot leading to a reduction in
   the number of large carbonaceous agglomerates. Biodiesel-E20 decreases
   accumulation mode particles of all sizes by reducing soot and the amount
   of biodiesel-derived semi-volatile organic carbon available for growing
   particles.
   Biodiesel increases LTC nucleation mode particles relative to diesel.
   Biodiesel-E20 increases the amount of small nucleation particles (<20
   nm) and decreases the amount of large nucleation particles (20-50 nm)
   relative to diesel. The increases in nucleation particles for biodiesel
   and small nucleation particles (<20 nm) for biodiesel-E20 are believed
   to be caused by less soot and more exhaust semi-volatile organic carbon
   causing increased nucleation. Biodiesel-B20 produces the lowest soot and
   total particle number concentration, both at conventional and premixed
   LTC, demonstrating its potential as an alternative fuel for diesel
   engines. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Computer hardware is moving from uniprocessor to multicore
   architectures. One problem arising in this evolution is that only
   parallel software can exploit the full performance potential of
   multicore architectures, and parallel software is far harder to write
   than conventional serial software. One important class of failures
   arising in parallel software is circular-wait deadlock in multithreaded
   programs. In our ongoing Gadara project, we use a special class of Petri
   nets, called Gadara nets, to systematically model multithreaded programs
   with lock allocation and release operations. In this paper, we propose
   an efficient optimal control synthesis methodology for ordinary Gadara
   nets that exploits the structural properties of Gadara nets via siphon
   analysis. Optimality in this context refers to the elimination of
   deadlocks in the program with minimally restrictive control logic. We
   formally establish a set of important properties of the proposed control
   synthesis methodology, and show that our algorithms never synthesize
   redundant control logic. We conduct experiments to evaluate the
   efficiency and scalability of the proposed methodology, and discuss the
   application of our results to real-world concurrent software.}},

Abstract = {{Energy management strategies in hybrid electric vehicles determine how
   much energy is produced/stored/used in each powertrain component. We
   propose an approach for energy management applied to a series hybrid
   electric vehicle that aims at improving the powertrain efficiency rather
   than the total fuel consumption. Since in the series configuration the
   engine is mechanically decoupled from the traction wheels, for a given
   power request the steady-state engine operating point is chosen to
   maximize the efficiency. A control algorithm regulates the transitions
   between different operating points by using the battery to smoothen the
   engine transients, thereby improving efficiency. Because of the
   constrained nature of the transient-smoothing problem, we implement the
   control algorithm by model predictive control. The control strategy
   feedback law is synthesized and integrated with the powertrain control
   software in the engine control unit. Simulations of the urban
   dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and US06 cycles using a complete
   vehicle system model and experimental tests of the UDDS cycle show
   improved fuel economy with respect to baseline strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The reconstruction of large osseous defects due to periodontitis is a
   challenge in regenerative therapy. Sclerostin, secreted by osteocytes,
   is a key physiological inhibitor of osteogenesis. Pharmacologic
   inhibition of sclerostin using sclerostin-neutralizing monoclonal
   antibody (Scl-Ab) thus increases bone formation, bone mass and bone
   strength in models of osteopenia and fracture repair. This study
   assessed the therapeutic potential of Scl-Ab to stimulate alveolar bone
   regeneration following experimental periodontitis (EP). Ligature-induced
   EP was induced in rats to generate localized alveolar bone defects.
   Following 4 weeks of disease induction, Scl-Ab (+EP) or vehicle (+/- EP)
   were systemically delivered, twice weekly for up to 6 wks to determine
   the ability of Scl-Ab to regenerate bone around tooth-supporting osseous
   defects. 3 and 6 wks after the initiation of Scl-Ab or vehicle
   treatment, femur and maxillary jawbones were harvested for histology,
   histomorphometry, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) of linear
   alveolar bone loss (ABL) and volumetric measures of bone support,
   including bone volume fraction (BVF) and tissue mineral density (TMD).
   Serum was analyzed to examine bone turnover markers during disease and
   regenerative therapy. Vehicle+EP animals exhibited maxillary bone loss
   (BVF, TMD and ABL) at ligature removal and thereafter. 6 weeks of Scl-Ab
   significantly improved maxillary bone healing, as measured by BVF, TMD
   and ABL, when compared to vehicle+EP. After 6 weeks of treatment, BVF
   and TMD values in the Scl-Ab+EP group were similar to those of healthy
   controls. Serum analysis demonstrated higher levels of bone formation
   markers osteocalcin and PINP in Scl-Ab treatment groups. Scl-Ab restored
   alveolar bone mass following experimental periodontitis. These findings
   warrant further exploration of Scl-Ab therapy in this and other oral
   bone defect disease scenarios. (c) 2013 American Society for Bone and

Title = {{Generating functional complex-based ship arrangements using network

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{107-115}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Generating ship arrangements is inherently a problem of identifying the
   spatial regions to be occupied by shipboard elements while balancing the
   impact on performance. Traditionally, elements are assigned a Cartesian
   coordinate location, and the allocation problem is solved in
   three-dimensional space. The coordinates for each subsequent element are
   selected by considering the element's interactions with placed and
   yet-to-be-placed elements. This paper presents a new approach to ship
   arrangements that starts with a non-spatial, network theory-based
   perspective and results in the traditional assignment of shipboard items
   to designated structural zones. Network partitioning is used to identify
   groups of mutually compatible ship elements, termed communities. A
   metric is introduced to express each community's cumulative preference
   to be located in specified regions of the ship. The cumulative
   preferences are used in a direct community-to-structural zone seeding
   procedure that creates reasonable initial compartment allocations. The
   rudimentary design knowledge required to position a particular set of
   shipboard elements using the proposed methods is ideally suited to
   early-stage design processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Environmental regulations play a significant role in ship design,
   manufacturing, operations, and disposal. As the life cycle progresses, a
   ship's environmental performance can degrade if more stringent policies
   are implemented at a port of call or for operations on the open seas.
   Tightened constraints over time may increase life cycle cost due to
   mandated replacement and repair costs, larger insurance premiums, or
   less operational flexibility. Unless design and maintenance activities
   account for uncertainty related to the environmental policy agenda,
   regulation changes can present considerable economic, operational, and
   mission-based risks to the life cycle of a vessel.
   The optimal design and maintenance strategy for time-dependent
   environmental compliance can be determined via the use of a sequential
   decision-making framework known as a Markov decision process (MDP). The
   purpose of the presented research is to demonstrate the application of a
   non-stationary MDP to the design and maintenance decisions of a ship
   that must consider ballast water exchange and treatment policy changes.
   Research efforts outline the preliminary approach, outcomes, and
   conclusions resulting from the use of a MDP to model life cycle

Abstract = {{Passive turbulence control (PTC) in the form of selectively distributed
   surface roughness is applied on a rigid circular cylinder on two
   end-springs. The cylinder is placed perpendicular to a uniform steady
   flow and the cylinder response is measured experimentally for 3 x
   10(4)<= Re <= 1.2 x 10(5) and broad ranges of the main PTC parameters.
   PTC consists of two roughness strips placed parallel to the cylinder
   axis and symmetrically to the flow with thickness on the order of the
   boundary layer thickness. Different flow-nduced motion (FIM) is observed
   depending primarily on the circumferential location of the two strips.
   FIM enhancement is studied in this paper in the soft galloping and the
   two hard galloping zones identified in the PTC-to-FIM Map. In galloping,
   amplitudes of oscillation reach 2.9 times the cylinder diameter limited
   only by the free-surface and bottom-boundary effects of the experimental
   facility. The galloping range follows the VIV range thus expanding
   dramatically the FIM range. Enhancement of FIM is needed to convert more
   hydrokinetic energy to mechanical and subsequently to electrical energy
   over broad velocity range. Use of laser broad field-of-view
   visualization reveals very different vortex structures between VIV and
   galloping confirming the fundamentally different driving mechanism of
   these two FIM kinds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The flow induced motions (FIM) of two rigid circular cylinders, on end
   linear-springs, in tandem are studied using two-dimensional Unsteady
   Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (2-D URANS) simulations verified by
   experimental data. Passive turbulence control (PTC) is being used in the
   Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory (MRELab) of the University of
   Michigan to enhance FIM of cylinders in the VIVACE (Vortex Induced
   Vibration for Aquatic Clean Energy) Converter to increase its efficiency
   and power density in harnessing marine hydrokinetic energy. Simulation
   is performed using a solver based on the open source CFD tool OpenFOAM,
   which solves continuum mechanics problems with a finite-volume
   discretization method. The simulated Reynolds number range for which
   experiments were conducted in the MRELab is 30,000 < Re < 105,000, which
   falls in the TrSL3 regime (Transition in Shear Layer), where the shear
   layers are fully saturated and consequently lift is high. The amplitude
   and frequency results are in excellent agreement with experimental data
   showing the initial and upper branches in VIV, transition from VIV to
   galloping, and galloping. Vortex structures are studied using
   high-resolution imaging from the CFD results showing typical 2S
   structure in the initial branch and both 2P+2S and 2P in the upper
   branch of VIV. In the galloping branch, amplitudes of 3.5 diameters are
   reached before the channel stops are hit. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The intrinsic degradation mechanisms leading to the initial burn-in
   deterioration in power conversion efficiency in small-molecule-based
   organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are studied. Specifically, we examine
   degradation in archetype boron subphthalocyanine chloride/fullerene OPVs
   in the absence of atmospheric contaminants such as water and oxygen.
   During the initial burn-in period (< 20 h), planar OPVs employing C-60
   as the acceptor exhibits a rapid decrease in efficiency that is
   primarily due to a reduction in photocurrent contributed by excitons
   generated in C-60, as observed by the changes in the spectrally-resolved
   external quantum efficiency. We develop an analytical model that
   ascribes the decrease in power conversion efficiency with aging to an
   energetically-driven increase in the density of exciton-induced
   quenching sites that hinder exciton diffusion to the donor-acceptor
   interface. This mechanism is mitigated by employing a C-70 acceptor, or
   a mixed donor-acceptor active layer where excitons are rapidly
   dissociated following photogeneration, thereby significantly reducing
   their lifetime and density. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This review summarizes recent efforts to create vascularized bone tissue
   in vitro and in vivo through the use of cell-based therapy approaches.
   The treatment of large and recalcitrant bone wounds is a serious
   clinical problem, and in the United States approximately 10\% of all
   fractures are complicated by delayed union or non-union. Treatment
   approaches with the use of growth factor and gene delivery have shown
   some promise, but results are variable and clinical complications have
   arisen. Cell-based therapies offer the potential to recapitulate key
   components of the bone-healing cascade, which involves concomitant
   regeneration of vasculature and new bone tissue. For this reason,
   osteogenic and vasculogenic cell types have been combined in co-cultures
   to capitalize on the function of each cell type and to promote
   heterotypic interactions. Experiments in both two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional systems have provided insight into the mechanisms by
   which osteogenic and vasculogenic cells interact to form vascularized
   bone, and these approaches have been translated to ectopic and
   orthotopic models in small-animal studies. The knowledge generated by
   these studies will inform and facilitate the next generation of
   pre-clinical studies, which are needed to move cell-based orthopaedic
   repair strategies into the clinic. The science and application of
   cytotherapy for repair of large and ischemic bone defects is developing
   rapidly and promises to provide new treatment methods for these
   challenging clinical problems.}},

Title = {{Buckling of rectangular and hexagonal honeycomb under combined axial
   compression and transverse shear}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{3934-3946}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{One of the many uses of honeycomb is as core in sandwich plates,
   producing very high stiffness-to-weight ratio structures. The
   macroscopically observed crushing mechanism of these structures has its
   origin in instabilities at the local scale. Of particular interest here
   are the critical (i.e., onset of a buckling-type instability) loads and
   corresponding eigenmodes of honeycomb under general 3D loading involving
   simultaneous axial compression and transverse shear.
   Since the critical eigenmodes in honeycomb often involve more than one
   unit cell, numerical studies are limited by the size of the domain
   considered for their analyses. We propose a new theoretical approach to
   determine the critical loads and eigenmodes of perfect honeycomb of
   infinite extent under general loading conditions based entirely on
   unit-cell calculations. It combines Bloch wave representation theorem
   for the eigenmode with the analytical solution of the linearized von
   Karman plate equations for the walls. The proposed approach uses the
   fact that the honeycomb walls remain flat in the principal solution
   prior to the onset of the first instability and solves analytically the
   corresponding eigenvalue problem. Three different geometries are
   considered.: rectangular honeycomb with varying in-plane aspect ratios,
   an isotropic-section hexagonal honeycomb, and an anisotropic-section
   hexagonal honeycomb (resulting from its manufacturing process).
   Several different loading cases are investigated: axial compression
   under free or fully constrained lateral expansion, transverse shear and
   combined axial compression and transverse shear. The results show that
   the buckling mode is highly dependent on the type of loading: e.g.,
   laterally unconstrained axial compression results in local critical
   eigenmodes, while constraining the lateral expansion leads to global
   ones. The addition of transverse shear not only reduces the critical
   axial strain, but also affects the wavelengths of the critical
   eigenmode. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The primary challenge in generating convincing augmented reality (AR)
   graphics is to project three-dimensional (3D) models onto a user's view
   of the real world and create a temporal and spatial sustained illusion
   that the virtual and real objects coexist. Regardless of the spatial
   relationship between the real and virtual objects, traditional AR
   graphical engines break the illusion of coexistence by displaying the
   real world merely as a background and superimposing virtual objects on
   the foreground. This research proposes a robust depth-sensing and frame
   buffer algorithm for handling occlusion problems in ubiquitous AR
   applications. A high-accuracy time-of-flight (TOF) camera is used to
   capture the depth map of the real world in real time. The distance
   information is processed in parallel using the OpenGL shading language
   (GLSL) and render to texture (RTT) techniques. The final processing
   results are written to the graphics frame buffers, allowing accurate
   depth resolution and hidden surface removal in composite AR scenes. The
   designed algorithm is validated in several indoor and outdoor
   experiments using the scalable and modular augmented reality template

Abstract = {{About 80-90\% of accidents are caused by the unsafe actions and
   behaviors of employees in construction. Behavior management thus plays a
   key role in enhancing safety, and particularly, behavior observation is
   the most critical element for modifying workers' behavior in a safe
   manner. However, there is a lack of practical methods to measure
   workers' behavior in construction. To analyze workers' actions, this
   paper uses an advanced and economical depth sensor to collect motion
   data and then investigates consequent motion-analysis techniques to
   detect the unsafe actions of workers, which is the main focus of this
   paper. First, motion data are transformed onto a three-dimensional (3D)
   space as a preprocess, motion classification is performed to identify a
   typical prior, and the selected prior is used to detect the same action
   in a testing data set. As a case study, motion data for unsafe actions
   in ladder climbing (i.e.,backward-facing climbing, climbing with an
   object, and reaching far to a side) are collected and used to detect the
   actions in a new testing data set in which the actions are randomly
   taken. The result shows that 90.91\% of unsafe actions are correctly
   detected in the experiment. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the understanding of pluripotent stem cell biology
   and emerging technologies to reprogram somatic cells to a stem cell-like
   state are helping bring stem cell therapies for a range of human
   disorders closer to clinical reality. Human pluripotent stem cells
   (hPSCs) have become a promising resource for regenerative medicine and
   research into early development because these cells are able to
   self-renew indefinitely and are capable of differentiation into
   specialized cell types of all 3 germ layers and trophoectoderm. Human
   PSCs include embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived from the inner cell
   mass of blastocyst-stage embryos and induced pluripotent stem cells
   (hiPSCs) generated via the reprogramming of somatic cells by the
   overexpression of key transcription factors. The application of hiPSCs
   and the finding that somatic cells can be directly reprogrammed into
   different cell types will likely have a significant impact on
   regenerative medicine. However, a major limitation for successful
   therapeutic application of hPSCs and their derivatives is the potential
   xenogeneic contamination and instability of current culture conditions.
   This review summarizes recent advances in hPSC culture and methods to
   induce controlled lineage differentiation through regulation of
   cell-signaling pathways and manipulation of gene expression as well as
   new trends in direct reprogramming of somatic cells.}},

Abstract = {{The clinical translation of stem-cell-based dental pulp regeneration
   will require the use of injectable scaffolds. Here, we tested the
   hypothesis that stem cells from exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) can
   generate a functional dental pulp when injected into full-length root
   canals. SHED survived and began to express putative markers of
   odontoblastic differentiation after 7 days when mixed with Puramatrix
   (peptide hydrogel), or after 14 days when mixed with recombinant human
   Collagen (rhCollagen) type I, and injected into the root canals of human
   premolars in vitro. Roots of human premolars injected with scaffolds
   (Puramatrix or rhCollagen) containing SHED were implanted subcutaneously
   into immunodeficient mice (CB-17 SCID). We observed pulp-like tissues
   with odontoblasts capable of generating new tubular dentin throughout
   the root canals. Notably, the pulp tissue engineered with SHED injected
   with either Puramatrix or rhCollagen type I presented similar
   cellularity and vascularization when compared with control human dental
   pulps. Analysis of these data, collectively, demonstrates that SHED
   injected into full-length human root canals differentiate into
   functional odontoblasts, and suggests that such a strategy might
   facilitate the completion of root formation in necrotic immature
   permanent teeth.}},

Abstract = {{Walking on uneven terrain is more energetically costly than walking on
   smooth ground, but the biomechanical factors that contribute to this
   increase are unknown. To identify possible factors, we constructed an
   uneven terrain treadmill that allowed us to record biomechanical,
   electromyographic and metabolic energetics data from human subjects. We
   hypothesized that walking on uneven terrain would increase step width
   and length variability, joint mechanical work and muscle co-activation
   compared with walking on smooth terrain. We tested healthy subjects
   (N=11) walking at 1.0 m.s(-1), and found that, when walking on uneven
   terrain with up to 2.5 cm variation, subjects decreased their step
   length by 4\% and did not significantly change their step width, while
   both step length and width variability increased significantly (22 and
   36\%, respectively; P<0.05). Uneven terrain walking caused a 28 and 62\%
   increase in positive knee and hip work, respectively, and a 26\% greater
   magnitude of negative knee work (0.0106, 0.1078 and 0.0425 J.kg(-1),
   respectively; P<0.05). Mean muscle activity increased in seven muscles
   in the lower leg and thigh (P<0.05). These changes caused overall net
   metabolic energy expenditure to increase by 0.73 W.kg(-1) (28\%;
   P<0.0001). Much of that increase could be explained by the increased
   mechanical work observed at the knee and hip. Greater muscle
   co-activation could also contribute to increased energetic cost but to
   unknown degree. The findings provide insight into how lower limb muscles
   are used differently for natural terrain compared with laboratory
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To measure the cost of nonattendance (no-shows) and benefit
   of overbooking and interventions to reduce no-shows for an outpatient
   endoscopy suite. Methods. We used a discrete-event simulation model to
   determine improved overbooking scheduling policies and examine the
   effect of no-shows on procedure utilization and expected net gain,
   defined as the difference in expected revenue based on Centers for
   Medicare \& Medicaid Services reimbursement rates and variable costs
   based on the sum of patient waiting time and provider and staff
   overtime. No-show rates were estimated from historical attendance (18\%
   on average, with a sensitivity range of 12\%-24\%). We then evaluated
   the effectiveness of scheduling additional patients and the effect of
   no-show reduction interventions on the expected net gain. Results. The
   base schedule booked 24 patients per day. The daily expected net gain
   with perfect attendance is \$4433.32. The daily loss attributed to the
   base case no-show rate of 18\% is \$725.42 (16.4\% of net gain), ranging
   from \$472.14 to \$1019.29 (10.7\%-23.0\% of net gain). Implementing
   no-show interventions reduced net loss by \$166.61 to \$463.09
   (3.8\%-10.5\% of net gain). The overbooking policy of 9 additional
   patients per day resulted in no loss in expected net gain when compared
   with the reference scenario. Conclusions. No-shows can significantly
   decrease the expected net gain of outpatient procedure centers.
   Overbooking can help mitigate the impact of no-shows on a suite's
   expected net gain and has a lower expected cost of implementation to the
   provider than intervention strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term outcome of patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma is poor.
   Limited availability of cell lines and lack of xenograft models is
   considered a major barrier to improved mechanistic understanding of this
   disease and development of effective therapies.
   Objective: To generate and characterize human mucoepidermoid carcinoma
   cell lines and xenograft models suitable for mechanistic and
   translational studies.
   Methods: Five human mucoepidermoid carcinoma specimens were available
   for generation of cell lines. Cell line tumorigenic potential was
   assessed by transplantation and serial in vivo passaging in
   immunodeficient mice, and cell line authenticity verified by short
   tandem repeat (STR) profiling.
   Results: A unique pair of mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell lines was
   established from a local recurrence (UM-HMC-3A) and from the metastatic
   lymph node (UM-HMC-3B) of the same patient, 4 years after surgical
   removal of the primary tumor. These cell lines retained epithelial-like
   morphology through 100 passages in vitro, contain the Crtc1-Maml2 fusion
   oncogene (characteristic of mucoepidermoid carcinomas), and express the
   prototypic target of this fusion (NR4A2). Both cell lines generated
   xenograft tumors when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Notably,
   the xenografts exhibited histological features and Periodic Acid Schiff
   (PAS) staining patterns that closely resembled those found in human
   tumors. STR profiling confirmed the origin and authenticity of these
   cell lines.
   Conclusion: These data demonstrate the generation and characterization
   of a pair of tumorigenic salivary mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell lines
   representative of recurrence and lymph node metastasis. Such models are
   useful for mechanistic and translational studies that might contribute
   to the discovery of new therapies for mucoepidermoid carcinoma. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Design of cancer-targeting nanotherapeutics relies on a pair of two
   functionally orthogonal molecules, one serving as a cancer cell-specific
   targeting ligand, and the other as a therapeutic cytotoxic agent. The
   present study investigates the validity of an alternative simplified
   strategy where a dual-acting molecule which bears both targeting and
   cytotoxic activity is conjugated to the nanoparticle as cancer-targeting
   nanotherapeutics. Herein, we demonstrate that methotrexate is applicable
   for this dual-acting strategy due to its reasonable affinity to folic
   acid receptor (FAR) as a tumor biomarker, and cytotoxic inhibitory
   activity of cytosolic dihydrofolate reductase. This article describes
   design of new methotrexate-conjugated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM)
   dendrimers, each carrying multiple copies of methotrexate attached
   through a stable amide linker. We evaluated their dual biological
   activities by performing surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, a

Abstract = {{Lasers emitting in the 600 nm wavelength range have gained attention for
   a number of important applications, including optical information
   processing, plastic fiber communication systems, optical storage, and
   full color (RGB) laser displays and laser projectors. Visible lasers are
   currently realized with GaN-based heterostructures having InGaN/GaN
   quantum wells as the gain media. The performance of these devices,
   particularly at longer wavelengths, is limited by materials
   inhomogeneity and effects related to a large strain-induced polarization
   in the quantum wells. A laser emitting in the red (lambda similar to 630
   nm) has not been realized. Here, we demonstrate lasers which emit at 630
   nm, the longest wavelength achieved with the nitride system, by
   incorporating InGaN/GaN self-organized quantum dots as the gain media.
   Strain relaxation during dot formation results in reduced polarization
   fields and consequently low threshold current density, J(th) = 2.5
   kA/cm(2), small blue shift of the emission peak, very weak temperature
   dependence of Jth (T-0 = 236 K), and linearly TE polarized output.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for estimating high dimensional
   covariance matrices. The method, permuted rank-penalized least-squares
   (PRLS), is based on a Kronecker product series expansion of the true
   covariance matrix. Assuming an i.i.d. Gaussian random sample, we
   establish high dimensional rates of convergence to the true covariance
   as both the number of samples and the number of variables go to
   infinity. For covariance matrices of low separation rank, our results
   establish that PRLS has significantly faster convergence than the
   standard sample covariance matrix (SCM) estimator. The convergence rate
   captures a fundamental tradeoff between estimation error and
   approximation error, thus providing a scalable covariance estimation
   framework in terms of separation rank, similar to low rank approximation
   of covariance matrices {[}1]. The MSE convergence rates generalize the
   high dimensional rates recently obtained for the ML Flip-flop algorithm
   {[}2], {[}3] for Kronecker product covariance estimation. We show that a
   class of block Toeplitz covariance matrices is approximatable by low
   separation rank and give bounds on the minimal separation rank that
   ensures a given level of bias. Simulations are presented to validate the
   theoretical bounds. As a real world application, we illustrate the
   utility of the proposed Kronecker covariance estimator for
   spatio-temporal linear least squares prediction of multivariate wind
   speed measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A large-scale surface effect ship (SES) bow seal testing platform was
   constructed by the University of Michigan and is presently being
   commissioned at the U.S. Navy's Large Cavitation Channel (LCC) in
   Memphis, TN. Using a recently installed (2008) free-surface forming
   gate, the test platform is capable of investigating the physics of the
   two-dimensional planing seal and three-dimensional finger-type bow seal
   in calm water conditions and at scales relevant to SES designers and
   numerical modelers. The LCC environment permits extended run times at
   high Reynolds number and provides unfettered optical access to the seal
   geometry and flow field. This article describes the development of the
   testing platform and presents some preliminary results. The test
   platform is nominally 7.9 m long, 1.52 m wide, and 2.0 m tall and of
   welded and bolted steel construction. The seals are nominally sized
   similar to those currently used by the U.S. Navy's Landing Craft Air
   Cushion class. An extensive measurement suite was integrated with the
   test platform. The goal was to provide numerical modelers a data set
   with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to validate their models
   of the experiment and, where appropriate, to develop new analytic
   models. The results of this effort demonstrate a feasible system for
   investigating surface effect ship seal physics within a large free
   surface water channel.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Simultaneous oxygenation and monitoring of glucose stimulus-secretion
   coupling factors in a single technique is critical for modeling
   pathophysiological states of islet hypoxia, especially in transplant
   environments. Standard hypoxic chamber techniques cannot modulate both
   stimulations at the same time nor provide real-time monitoring of
   glucose stimulus-secretion coupling factors. To address these
   difficulties, we applied a multilayered microfluidic technique to
   integrate both aqueous and gas phase modulations via a diffusion
   membrane. This creates a stimulation sandwich around the microscaled
   islets within the transparent polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) device,
   enabling monitoring of the aforementioned coupling factors via
   fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, the gas input is controlled by a
   pair of microdispensers, providing quantitative, sub-minute modulations
   of oxygen between 0-21\%. This intermittent hypoxia is applied to
   investigate a new phenomenon of islet preconditioning. Moreover, armed
   with multimodal microscopy, we were able to look at detailed calcium and
   KATP channel dynamics during these hypoxic events. We envision
   microfluidic hypoxia, especially this simultaneous dual phase technique,
   as a valuable tool in studying islets as well as many ex vivo tissues.}},

Abstract = {{A method for segmenting three-dimensional data of underwater
   unstructured terrains is presented. The three-dimensional point clouds
   are converted to two-dimensional elevation maps and analyzed for
   segmentation in the frequency domain. The lower frequency components
   represent the slower varying undulations of the underlying ground. The
   cut-off frequency, below which the frequency components form the ground
   surface, is determined automatically using peak detection. The user can
   also specify a maximum admissible size of objects to drive the automatic
   detection of the cut-off frequency. The points above the estimated
   ground surface are clustered via standard proximity clustering to form
   object segments. The precision of the segmentation is compared against
   ground truth hand labelled data acquired by a stereo camera pair and a
   structured light sensor. It is also evaluated for registration error
   when the extracted segments are used for sub-map alignment. The proposed
   approach is compared to three point cloud based and two image based
   segmentation algorithms. The results show that the approach is
   applicable to a range of different terrains and is able to generate

Abstract = {{Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant medication that produces
   improvements in functions associated with multiple neurocognitive
   systems. To investigate the potentially distributed effects of
   methylphenidate on the brain's intrinsic network architecture, we
   coupled resting state imaging with multivariate pattern classification.
   In a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized,
   counterbalanced, cross-over design, 32 healthy human volunteers received
   either methylphenidate or placebo prior to two fMRI resting state scans
   separated by approximately one week. Resting state connectomes were
   generated by placing regions of interest at regular intervals throughout
   the brain, and these connectomes were submitted for support vector
   machine analysis. We found that methylphenidate produces a distributed,
   reliably detected, multivariate neural signature. Methylphenidate
   effects were evident across multiple resting state networks, especially
   visual, somatomotor, and default networks. Methylphenidate reduced
   coupling within visual and somatomotor networks. In addition, default
   network exhibited decoupling with several task positive networks,
   consistent with methylphenidate modulation of the competitive
   relationship between these networks. These results suggest that
   connectivity changes within and between large-scale networks are
   potentially involved in the mechanisms by which methylphenidate improves
   attention functioning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organic liquid scintillation detectors have shown promise as neutron
   detectors for characterizing special nuclear materials in various
   arms-control applications. Deuterated liquids, such as EJ315, are
   attractive for spectroscopy applications because the backward peaked n-d
   scattering results in enhanced coupling between incident neutron energy
   and resulting pulse height. This will likely allow better spectrum
   unfolding. In this work, we present a measured neutron response matrix
   for a three-by-two-in. cylindrical EJ315 detector, and compare to the
   hydrogen based liquid EJ309 in an otherwise identical assembly. We also
   present measured light-output relations for both detectors. A Continuous
   spectrum neutron source, obtained with the bombardment of B-11 with
   5.5-McV deuterons at the tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at the
   University of Notre Dame, was used for the measurement. Detected
   neutrons were sorted via time of flight into 100-keV energy groups, over
   the energy range from 0.5 to 15 MeV. The resulting response matrix
   represents a detailed characterization of pulse-height response to
   neutrons over that energy range. To the authors' knowledge, a measured
   response matrix and light-output relation for EJ315 have not been
   reported, and published characterizations of the similar NE230 are of
   less detail over this energy range. Matrix-condition analysis indicates
   an advantage for EJ315 over EJ309 in the number of independent
   parameters available in inversion procedures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider an infrastructure as a network with supply,
   transshipment, and demand nodes. A subset of potential arcs can be
   constructed between node pairs for conveying service flows. The paper
   studies two optimization models under stochastic arc disruption. Model 1
   focuses on a single network with small-scale failures, and repairs arcs
   for quick service restoration. Model 2 considers multiple interdependent
   infrastructures under large-scale disruptions, and mitigates cascading
   failures by selectively disconnecting failed components. We formulate
   both models as scenario-based stochastic mixed-integer programs, in
   which the first-stage problem builds arcs, and the second-stage problem
   optimizes recourse operations for restoring service or mitigating
   losses. The goal is to minimize the total cost of infrastructure design
   and recovery operations. We develop cutting-plane algorithms and several
   heuristic approaches for solving the two models. Model 1 is tested on an
   IEEE 118-bus system. Model 2 is tested on systems consisting of the
   118-bus system, a 20-node network, and/or a 50-node network, with
   randomly generated interdependency sets in three different topological
   forms (i.e., chain, tree, and cycle). The computational results
   demonstrate that (i) decomposition and cutting-plane algorithms
   effectively solve Model 1, and (ii) heuristic approaches dramatically
   decrease the CPU time for Model 2, but yield worse bounds when
   cardinalities of interdependency sets increase. Future research includes
   developing special algorithms for optimizing Model 2 for complex
   multiple infrastructures with special topological forms of system
   interdependency. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present an output-based mesh adaptation strategy for Navier-Stokes
   simulations on deforming domains. The equations are solved with an
   arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach, using a discontinuous
   Galerkin finite-element discretization in both space and time. Discrete
   unsteady adjoint solutions, derived for both the state and the geometric
   conservation law, provide output error estimates and drive adaptation of
   the space-time mesh. Spatial adaptation consists of dynamic order
   increment or decrement on a fixed tessellation of the domain, while a
   combination of coarsening and refinement is used to provide an efficient
   time step distribution. Results from compressible Navier-Stokes
   simulations in both two and three dimensions demonstrate the accuracy
   and efficiency of the proposed approach. In particular, the method is
   shown to outperform other common adaptation strategies, which, while
   sometimes adequate for static problems, struggle in the presence of mesh
   motion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Timely decision making for least-cost maintenance of wind turbines is a
   critical factor in reducing the total cost of wind energy. The current
   models for the wind industry as well as other industries often involve
   solving computationally expensive algorithms such as dynamic
   programming. This article presents a tractable approximation of the
   dynamic decision-making process to alleviate the computational burden.
   Based upon an examination of decision rules in stationary weather
   conditions, a new set of decision rules is developed to incorporate
   dynamic weather changes. Since the decisions are made with a set of
   If-Then rules, the proposed approach is computationally efficient and
   easily integrated into the simulation framework. It can also benefit
   actual wind farm operations by providing implementable control.
   Numerical studies using field data mainly from the literature
   demonstrate that the proposed method provides practical guidelines for
   reducing operational costs as well as enhancing the marketability of
   wind energy.}},

Abstract = {{In modern manufacturing systems, online sensing is being increasingly
   used for process monitoring and fault diagnosis. In many practical
   situations, the output of the sensing system is represented by
   time-ordered data known as profiles or waveform signals. Most of the
   work reported in the literature has dealt with cases in which the
   production process is characterized by single profiles. In some
   industrial practices, however, the online sensing system is designed so
   that it records more than one profile at each operation cycle. For
   example, in multi-operation forging processes with transfer or
   progressive dies, four sensors are used to measure the tonnage force
   exerted on dies. To effectively analyze multichannel profiles, it is
   crucial to develop a method that considers the interrelationships
   between different profile channels. A method for analyzing multichannel
   profiles based on uncorrelated multilinear principal component analysis
   is proposed in this article for the purpose of characterizing process
   variations, fault detection, and fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of
   the proposed method is demonstrated by using simulations and a case
   study on a multi-operation forging process.}},

Abstract = {{This letter presents a novel topology for a buck dc-dc converter with
   soft-switching capability, which operates under a zero-current-switching

   In order to realize soft switching, based on a basic buck converter, the
   proposed converter added a small inductor, a diode, and an inductor
   coupled with the main inductor. Because of soft switching, the proposed
   converter can obtain a high efficiency under heavy load conditions.
   Moreover, a high efficiency is also achieved under light load
   conditions, which is significantly different from other soft-switching
   buck converters. The detailed theoretical analyses of steady-state
   operation modes are presented, and the detailed design methods and some
   simulation results are also given. Finally, a 600 W prototype is built
   to validate the theoretical principles. The switching waveforms and the
   efficiencies are also measured to validate the proposed topology.}},

Abstract = {{The last decades of neuroscience research have produced immense progress
   in the methods available to understand brain structure and function.
   Social, cognitive, clinical, affective, economic, communication, and
   developmental neurosciences have begun to map the relationships between
   neuro-psychological processes and behavioral outcomes, yielding a new
   understanding of human behavior and promising interventions. However, a
   limitation of this fast moving research is that most findings are based
   on small samples of convenience. Furthermore, our understanding of
   individual differences may be distorted by unrepresentative samples,
   undermining findings regarding brain-behavior mechanisms. These
   limitations are issues that social demographers, epidemiologists, and
   other population scientists have tackled, with solutions that can be
   applied to neuroscience. By contrast, nearly all social science
   disciplines, including social demography, sociology, political science,
   economics, communication science, and psychology, make assumptions about
   processes that involve the brain, but have incorporated neural measures
   to differing, and often limited, degrees; many still treat the brain as
   a black box. In this article, we describe and promote a
   perspective-population neuroscience-that leverages interdisciplinary
   expertise to (i) emphasize the importance of sampling to more clearly
   define the relevant populations and sampling strategies needed when
   using neuroscience methods to address such questions; and (ii) deepen
   understanding of mechanisms within population science by providing
   insight regarding underlying neural mechanisms. Doing so will increase
   our confidence in the generalizability of the findings. We provide
   examples to illustrate the population neuroscience approach for specific
   types of research questions and discuss the potential for theoretical
   and applied advances from this approach across areas.}},

Abstract = {{Delay-coupled networks are investigated with nonidentical delay times

Abstract = {{GaN nanowires containing AlN/GaN distributed Bragg reflector (DBR)

   significantly blue-shifted from the ideal calculated value. The
   discrepancy is explained by investigating the reflectance of the
   nanoscale DBRs with a finite difference time domain technique. Ensemble
   nanowire microcavities with In0.3Ga0.7N nanowires clad by AlN/GaN DBRs
   have also been characterized. Room temperature emission from the
   microcavity exhibits considerable linewidth narrowing compared to that
   measured for unclad In0.3Ga0.7N nanowires. The resonant emission is
   characterized by a peak wavelength and linewidth of 575 nm and 39 nm,

Abstract = {{Mouse anterior-posterior axis polarization is preceded by formation of
   the distal visceral endoderm (DVE) by unknown mechanisms. Here, we show
   by in vitro culturing of embryos immediately after implantation in
   microfabricated cavities that the external mechanical cues exerted on
   the embryo are crucial for DVE formation, as well as the elongated egg
   cylinder shape, without affecting embryo-intrinsic transcriptional
   programs except those involving DVE-specific genes. This implies that
   these developmental events immediately after implantation are not simply
   embryo-autonomous processes but require extrinsic factors from maternal
   tissues. Moreover, the mechanical forces induce a breach of the basement
   membrane barrier at the distal portion locally, and thereby the
   transmigrated epiblast cells emerge as the DVE cells. Thus, we propose
   that external mechanical forces exerted by the interaction between
   embryo and maternal uterine tissues directly control the location of DVE
   formation at the distal tip and consequently establish the mammalian
   primary body axis.}},

Pages = {{172-177}},

Abstract = {{The spontaneous healing of aqueous pores in poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic
   acid) (PLGA) drug delivery systems has been identified to play a key
   role in terminating the burst release of large molecules, and to provide
   a means for novel aqueous-based microencapsulation. To examine healing
   of PLGA, pores were created of defined size and depth on the surface of
   thin PLGA films by stamping with blunt-tip microneedles. Pore dimensions
   on the micron-scale were relevant to surface pores of common PLGA
   microspheres and could be easily monitored by light microscopy. Most
   pores healed reproducibly at temperatures above the glass-transition
   temperature (T-g) of the films, with healing times decreasing sharply
   with increasing temperature according to Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF)
   behavior. It is suggested that healing is driven by high surface tension
   in the films and occurs through viscoelastic creep. Hydrated films
   healed at lower temperatures than dry films, consistent with a drop in
   T-g upon polymer hydration. Larger pores took longer to heal than
   smaller ones, while pores larger than 20 mu m did not heal before
   significant polymer degradation occurred. Films of a less hydrophobic
   PLGA showed slower healing kinetics, attributed to a weaker surface
   tension driving force. Deeper pores showed signs of in-plane stress from
   spin-coating, and either ruptured or only partially healed when
   incubated wet and dry, respectively. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   arrays with controlled periodicity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{While the formation of cracks is often stochastic and considered
   undesirable, controlled fracture would enable rapid and low cost
   manufacture of micro/nanostructures. Here, we report a
   propagation-controlled technique to guide fracture of thin films
   supported on soft substrates to create crack arrays with highly
   controlled periodicity. Precision crack patterns are obtained by the use
   of strategically positioned stress-focusing V-notch features under
   conditions of slow application of strain to a degree where the notch
   features and intrinsic crack spacing match. This simple but robust
   approach provides a variety of precisely spaced crack arrays on both
   flat and curved surfaces. The general principles are applicable to a
   wide variety of multi-layered materials systems because the method does
   not require the careful control of defects associated with
   initiation-controlled approaches. There are also no intrinsic
   limitations on the area over which such patterning can be performed
   opening the way for large area micro/nano-manufacturing.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Dendritic cells (DCs) capture pathogens and foreign antigen (Ag) in
   peripheral tissues and migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues, such as
   lymph nodes (LNs), where they present processed Ag as MHC-bound peptide
   (pMHC) to naive T cells. Interactions between DCs and T cells result,
   over periods of hours, in activation, clonal expansion and
   differentiation of antigen-specific T cells, leading to primed cells
   that can now participate in immune responses. Two-photon microscopy
   (2PM) has been widely adopted to analyze lymphocyte dynamics and can
   serve as a powerful in vivo assay for cell trafficking and activation
   over short length and time scales. Linking biological phenomena between
   vastly different spatiotemporal scales can be achieved using a systems
   biology approach. We developed a 3D agent-based cellular model of a LN
   that allows for the simultaneous in silico simulation of T cell
   trafficking, activation and production of effector cells under different
   antigen (Ag) conditions. The model anatomy is based on in situ analysis
   of LN sections (from primates and mice) and cell dynamics based on
   quantitative measurements from 2PM imaging of mice. Our simulations make
   three important predictions. First, T cell encounters by DCs and T cell
   receptor (TCR) repertoire scanning are more efficient in a 3D model
   compared with 2D, suggesting that a 3D model is needed to analyze LN
   function. Second, LNs are able to produce primed CD4+T cells at the same
   efficiency over broad ranges of cognate frequencies (from 10(-5) to
   10(-2)). Third, reducing the time that naive T cells are required to
   bind DCs before becoming activated will increase the rate at which
   effector cells are produced. This 3D model provides a robust platform to
   study how T cell trafficking and activation dynamics relate to the
   efficiency of T cell priming and clonal expansion. We envision that this
   systems biology approach will provide novel insights for guiding vaccine
   development and understanding immune responses to infection. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Liquid scintillators are suitable for many applications because they can
   detect and characterize fast neutrons as well as gamma-rays. This paper
   presents the response of a 15-cm-in-length x 15-cm-in-height x
   8.2-cm-in-width EJ-309 liquid scintillator with respect to the position
   of neutron and gamma-ray interactions. Liquid scintillator cells are
   typically filled with 97\% of the scintillating cocktail to address
   thermal expansion of the liquid in varying temperature conditions.
   Measurements were taken with collimated Cs-137 and Cf-252 sources for
   gamma-ray and neutron mapping of the detector, respectively.
   MCNPX-PoliMi (ver. 2.0) simulations were also performed to demonstrate
   the spatial response of the detector. Results show that the detector
   response is greatest at the center and decreases when the collimated
   neutron and gamma-ray beam is moved toward the edge of the detector. The
   measured response in the voxels surrounding the detector center
   decreased by approximately 6\% and 12\% for gamma-ray and neutron scans,
   respectively, when compared to the center voxel. The measured decrease
   in the detector response was most pronounced at the corners of detector
   assembly. For the corner voxels located in the bottom row of the
   detector, the measured response decreased by approximately 39\% for both
   gamma-ray and neutron scans. For the corner voxels located in the top
   row of the detector, the measured response decreased by approximately
   66\% and 48\% for gamma-ray and neutron scans, respectively. Both
   measurements and simulations show the inefficient production of
   secondary charged particles in the voxels located in the top portion of
   the detector due to the presence of expansion volume. Furthermore, the
   presence of the expansion volume potentially affects the transport of
   the scintillation light through the coupling window between the liquid
   scintillator and the photocathode in the photomultiplier tube. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We investigate the Brownian motion of boomerang colloidal particles

   that the mean displacements are biased towards the center of

   exhibit a crossover from short-time faster to long-time slower diffusion
   with the short-time diffusion coefficients dependent on the points used
   for tracking. A model based on Langevin theory elucidates that these

Title = {{Improving Fatty Acid Availability for Bio-Hydrocarbon Production in
   Escherichia coli by Metabolic Engineering}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of producing
   fatty-acid-derived hydrocarbons in Escherichia coli. However, product
   titers and yields remain low. In this work, we demonstrate new methods
   for improving fatty acid production by modifying central carbon
   metabolism and storing fatty acids in triacylglycerol. Based on
   suggestions from a computational model, we deleted seven genes involved
   in aerobic respiration, mixed-acid fermentation, and glyoxylate bypass
   (in the order of cyoA, nuoA, ndh, adhE, dld, pta, and iclR) to modify
   the central carbon metabolic/regulatory networks. These gene deletions
   led to increased total fatty acids, which were the highest in the
   mutants containing five or six gene knockouts. Additionally, when two
   key enzymes in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway were over-expressed,
   we observed further increase in strain Delta cyoA Delta adhE Delta nuoA
   Delta ndh Delta pta Delta dld, leading to 202 mg/g dry cell weight of
   total fatty acids, similar to 250\% of that in the wild-type strain.
   Meanwhile, we successfully introduced a triacylglycerol biosynthesis
   pathway into E. coli through heterologous expression of wax ester
   synthase/acylcoenzyme: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT) enzymes.
   The added pathway improved both the amount and fuel quality of the fatty
   acids. These new metabolic engineering strategies are providing
   promising directions for future investigation.}},

Title = {{Temporal dynamics of soil moisture in a northern temperate mixed
   successional forest after a prescribed intermediate disturbance}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{22-33}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Forested ecosystems may experience intermediate disturbances that
   involve changes of crown-scale canopy characteristics. When such changes
   occur, soil moisture under disturbed canopy may become either drier or
   wetter, depending on the interplay between small-scale hydrological
   processes, tree-scale vegetation function, and meteorological forcing.
   Understanding the contributing factors that impact small-scale soil
   water dynamics is vital for predicting long-term and larger-scale
   changes of forest hydrology following disturbances, succession, and
   management processes. In this study, we initiated half-hourly,
   three-meter deep measurements of soil moisture at four plots in a
   northern temperate mixed forest near the University of Michigan
   Biological Station. Two of the plots (one aspen- and the other
   oak-dominated) are located near the AmeriFlux tower; this forest area
   represents an undisturbed control site. Two other plots are located near
   the Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment (FASET) flux tower. An
   intermediate disturbance was prescribed in this area through stem
   girdling of all canopy-dominant, early successional aspen and birch
   trees to simulate the anticipated large-scale succession process in the
   Upper Great Lakes area. The data collected at the four plots provide
   observational evidence of changes in hydrological dynamics that were
   induced by species-specific crown-scale disturbances of the canopy
   structure.
   Data analysis reveals that the soil water storage under the girdled
   aspen was persistently higher, as compared to the undisturbed plots over
   the observational period of 2009-2011. The study argues that the larger
   water storage resulted from increased net precipitation and reduced
   transpiration during growing seasons following the girdling operation.
   These processes ``outcompeted{''} the presumably enhanced interception
   and transpiration by understory plants as well as increased soil
   evaporation. Additionally, surface soil layer at the disturbed plot
   exhibited highest temporal variability among all monitored plots. The
   moisture profiles at the four plots were different, with the disturbed
   plot exhibiting relatively wetter shallow soil layers. Furthermore,
   water loss at the disturbed plot was concentrated in shallower soil
   layers, signifying a shift of uptake and/or change of dominant
   processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{240}},
Pages = {{155-167}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the grain boundary effect on Li-ion diffusivity and
   intercalation-induced stress in a single-particle Li-ion cell. The
   measured activation energy for self-diffusion at the grain boundary is a
   fraction of that in the lattice due to the loosely packed structure, and
   this results in a diffusivity that is 3-16 orders of magnitude higher in
   the grain boundary than in the lattice. To study how grain boundaries
   affect Li-ion battery performance, grain boundaries are modeled inside
   ellipsoidal cathode (LiMn2O4) particles and placed under potentiodynamic
   and galvanostatic control simulations. A Voronoi grain distribution is
   employed in modeling grain boundaries. The grain boundary effect on
   Li-ion diffusivity is evaluated by computing an apparent diffusion
   coefficient from the cathode particles containing different grain
   boundary densities. It is shown that the apparent diffusion coefficient
   increases with increasing grain boundary densities. With enhanced Li-ion
   diffusivity, particles are found to have higher capacity utilizations,
   especially under high discharge C-rates. The inclusion of grain
   boundaries also lowered intercalation-induced stress by reducing the
   overall Li+ concentration gradients developed within particles during
   cycling. However, as local Li+ concentration distribution depends on
   grain boundary network geometries, intercalation-induced stress varied
   appreciably within the different grain boundary network geometries. (C)

Abstract = {{State of health (SOH) of batteries in electric and hybrid vehicles can
   be observed using some battery parameters. Based on a
   resistance-capacitance circuit model of the battery and data obtained
   from abundant experiments, it was observed that the diffusion
   capacitance shows great correlation with SOH of a lithium-ion battery.
   However, accurate measurement of this diffusion capacitance in real time
   in an electric or hybrid electric vehicle is not practical. In this
   paper, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to estimate the battery model
   parameters including the diffusion capacitance in real time using
   measurement of current and voltage of the battery. The battery SOH can
   then be determined using the identified diffusion capacitance.
   Temperature influence is also considered to improve the robustness and
   precision of SOH estimation results. Experimental results on various

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion battery performance is affected by cut surface quality
   during the electrodes' cutting process. Currently, die cutting and
   rotary knife slitting have been used to cut prismatic and cylindrical
   electrodes, respectively. Both techniques, which require expensive
   tooling that wear out over time, result in process instability and poor
   cut quality. These will cause an internal short circuit and significant
   heat generation in the cells. Laser cutting, proved and widely utilized
   in the industry, can solve the abovementioned problems by improving cut
   surface quality due to many advantages, such as no tool wear, high
   energy concentration, fast processing speed, very narrow Heat Affected
   Zone, applicability to nearly all materials, and flexibility of laser
   power. Investigating underlying physical phenomena with numerical
   analysis provides significant advantages to fully utilize the remote
   laser cutting of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. In this paper, a
   mathematical model of three-dimensional self-consistent remote laser
   cutting is presented for anode (graphite-coated copper) of lithium-ion
   batteries. Computational and experimental results, obtained by using
   laser power of 450 Wand scanning speed of 5 m s(-1), show a two-step
   melt pool geometry and copper composition increase on the material

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a proof-of-principle for a new signal
   transduction method for protein detection called Bead Assembly
   Magnetorotation (BAM). BAM is based on using the target protein to
   mediate the formation of aptamer-coated 1 mu m magnetic beads into a
   bead assembly, formed at the bottom of a 1 mu L hanging droplet. The
   size, shape and fractal dimension of this bead assembly all depend on
   the protein concentration. The protein concentration can be measured in
   two ways: by magnetorotation, in which the rotational period of the
   assembly correlates with the protein concentration, or by fractal
   analysis. Additionally, a microscope-free magnetorotation detection
   method is introduced, based on a simple laser apparatus built from
   standard laboratory components. In this paper, we chose to focus on the
   protein thrombin, a popular choice for proof-of-principle work in this
   field. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Application of Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) into vehicle
   structures calls for innovative manufacturing processes. In terms of
   reducing deformation resistance through external energy, Electra-Plastic
   Effect (EPE) provides a potential alternative to traditional thermal
   softening phenomenon. In this work, effectiveness of EPE on one group of
   AHSS, Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) Steel, was evaluated. It
   was found that EPE cannot be effectively initiated until the current
   density reaches a threshold value between 7.4 A/mm(2) and 11.4 A/mm(2).
   Besides, the softening phenomenon is more distinct at larger strains.
   Underlying mechanisms are explained from perspectives of dislocation
   multiplication, gliding and mechanical twinning. The inevitable joule
   heating phenomenon associated with current was suppressed with forced
   air cooling and the temperature distribution inside the tensile specimen
   was numerically calculated with a coupled Finite Element Model.
   Effectiveness of EPE rather than thermal softening or expansion was
   further proved with the larger flow stress reduction under higher
   current density and shorter pulses at same temperature increase.
   Hollomon equation was adopted to model the observed stress strain
   relationships. Since material properties of TRIP steels are directly
   related to the phase transformation from retained austenite into
   martensite, volume fraction of retained austenite was quantitatively
   measured by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). It was found that the applied
   current retarded martensitic transformation process. Metallographic
   analysis was further performed and phenomena of change of grain
   structures and phase distribution were hardly observable. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Immobilization of biomolecules, such as proteins or sugars, is a key
   issue in biotechnology because it enables the understanding of cellular
   behavior in more biological relevant environment. Here,
   poly(4-ethynyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene) coatings have been fabricated
   by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization in order to bind
   bioactive molecules onto the surface of the material. The control of the
   thickness of the CVD films has been achieved by tuning the amount of
   precursor used for deposition. Copper-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition
   has then been performed via microcontact printing to immobilize various
   biomolecules on the reactive coatings. The selectivity of this click
   chemistry reaction has been confirmed by spatially controlled
   conjugation of fluorescent sugar recognizing molecules (lectins) as well
   as cell adhesion onto the peptide pattern. In addition, a
   microstructured coating that may undergo multiple click chemistry
   reactions has been developed by two sequential CVD steps.
   Poly(4-ethynyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene) and
   poly(4-formyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene) have been patterned via
   vapor-assisted micropatterning in replica structures (VAMPIR). A
   combination of Huisgen cycloaddition and carbonyl-hydrazide coupling was
   used to spatially direct the immobilization of sugars on a patterned
   substrate. This work opens new perspectives in tailoring
   microstructured, multireactive interfaces that can be decorated via
   bio-orthogonal chemistry for use as mimicking the biological environment
   of cells.}},

Abstract = {{The general objectives of the work reported here and in accompanying
   papers are to identify optimal tools for the synthesis of silsesquioxane
   (SQ)-based BoC oligomers and polymers, especially those that show 3-D,
   through-chain (cage) conjugation in the excited state. Here we first
   examine the utility of polymerizing (p-IPhSiO1.5)(8) with divinylbenzene
   (DVB) using Heck catalytic cross-coupling as baseline systems for BoCs
   with model dendrons. Thereafter, we functionalize the remaining IPh
   groups by cross-coupling with 4-MeOC6H4CH=CH2 or 4-NH2C6H4CH=CH2. As an
   alternate approach, we first functionalize (p-IPhSiO1.5)(8) with
   4-MeOC6H4CH=CH2 or 4-NH2C6H4CH=CH2 by catalytic cross-coupling such that
   only an average of two iodophenyls remain and then polymerized with DVB
   or 1,4-diethynylbenzne (DEB). This latter approach permits synthesis of
   copolymers as demonstrated using 1:1 mixtures of the two SQs with R =
   NH2 or OMe. Here we assess the utility of two different routes to
   conjugated BoC polymers. Investigation of the UV-vis absorption and
   emission properties of these BoCs indicates the DVB polymers exhibit no
   emission red-shifts because a significant portion of the DVB used is the
   1,3-isomer. However, the DEB polymers reveal nm red-shifts and charge
   transfer (CT) behavior, suggesting electronic interactions between SQ
   cages through the conjugated, bridging moieties. DEB copolymers with R =
   NH2- and MeO- stilbene functional groups on the cages show red-shifts
   intermediate between the red-shifts of the simple homopolymers, rather
   than independent emissions from both units as would obtain with a
   physical mixture again supporting electronic communication along the
   polymer chains and through the cages via the conjugated linkers.}},

   {[}vinylSiO(1.5)](x)PhSiO1.5](10.x/12-x) mixtures followed by
   copolymerization with divinylbenzene (via ADMET), or using reverse Heck
   coupling with 1,4-dibromobenzene and 4,4'-dibromo-stilbene to prepare
   lightly branched, nonlinear BOC systems. In another paper, we describe
   the use of Heck and Suzuki coupling to synthesize model conjugated
   p-R-stilbeneSQ BOCs starting from {[}p-IPh8SiO1.5](8) and coupling with
   divinylbenzene (DVB) and 1,4-diethynylbenzene (DEB) finding extended 3-D
   conjugation in the DEB polymers. We find that the reverse Heck coupling
   (where the linker contains the bromo moieties) works best for these
   systems giving BoC oligomers with M-n of similar to 6 KDa, in which
   extended excited state conjugation is observed for 1,4-dibromobenzene
   linked systems through similar to 50+ nm red shifts in the emission
   spectra compared with DVB linked systems and model compounds. We compare
   contrast the photophysical properties of the two sets of BOCs and the
   system where the conjugation length of the linker changes from
   divinylbenzene to divinylstilbene. We find that for a linker with a
   longer conjugation length, a red-shifted absorption and emission is
   observed; however, the difference in emission is much larger for the
   1,4-dibromobenzene-linked system as compared to the model compounds,
   suggesting that a more rigid linker contributes to better orbital
   overlap with the cage and/or phenyl groups, increasing excited state
   conjugation interactions.}},

   creating grating patterns at high speed. By modulating the tool
   vibration frequency, substrate feeding rate, and the tool tilting angle,
   the period-variable chirped gratings and angle-tunable blazed gratings
   can be easily achieved; they can be utilized in various optoelectronics

Abstract = {{Background: Cardiac myocytes experience mechanical stress during each
   heartbeat. Excessive mechanical stresses under pathological conditions
   cause functional and structural remodeling that lead to heart diseases,
   yet the precise mechanisms are still incompletely understood. To study
   the cellular and molecular level mechanotransduction mechanisms, we
   developed a new `cell-in-gel' experimental system to exert multiaxial
   (3-D) stresses on a single myocyte during active contraction.
   Methods: Isolated myocytes are embedded in an elastic hydrogel to
   simulate the mechanical environment in myocardium (afterload). When
   electrically stimulated, the in-gel myocyte contracts while the matrix
   resists shortening and broadening of the cell, exerting normal and shear
   stresses on the cell. Here we provide a mechanical analysis, based on
   the Eshelby inclusion problem, of the 3-D strain and stress inside and
   outside the single myocyte during contraction in an elastic matrix.
   Results: (1) The fractional shortening of the myocyte depends on the
   cell's geometric dimensions and the relative stiffness of the cell to
   the gel. A slender or softer cell has less fractional shortening. A
   myocyte of typical dimensions embedded in a gel of similar elastic
   stiffness can contract only 20\% of its load-free value. (2) The
   longitudinal stress inside the cell is about 15 times the transverse
   stress level. (3) The traction on the cell surface is highly
   non-uniform, with a maximum near its ends, showing `hot spots' at the
   location of intercalated disks. (4) The mechanical energy expenditure of
   the myocyte increases with the matrix stiffness in a monotonic and
   nonlinear manner.
   Conclusion: Our mechanical analyses provide analytic solutions that
   readily lend themselves to parametric studies. The resulting 3-D mapping
   of the strain and stress states serve to analyze and interpret ongoing
   cell-in-gel experiments, and the mathematical model provides an
   essential tool to decipher and quantify mechanotransduction mechanisms
   in cardiac myocytes.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-artery vapor chamber was designed, built and tested in this
   study. In this vapor chamber, the wick structure consists of sintered
   copper powder layers on the top and bottom plates, operating as
   evaporator and condenser wick respectively, and sintered copper powder
   rings embedded with solid copper columns operating as liquid flow path.
   Copper powder rings contact the tip of the condenser and evaporator
   wicks directly to provide a short return path for the working fluid.
   Solid copper columns are welded together with the top and bottom plate
   to prevent deformation of the vapor chamber, which is caused by the
   internal and external pressure difference. An experimental system with
   joule heating and water cooling was built. Thermal resistance was
   defined to characterize the performance. The performance of the vapor
   chamber under different heat loads, heating areas and heating modes were
   tested and analyzed. The lowest measured thermal resistance is less than
   0.08 K cm(2)/W using a 1 cm(2) heat source. The maximum tested heat flux
   is 300 W/cm(2) without the capillary or boiling limits reached. As
   compared with the vapor chambers reported in the literature, this vapor
   chamber has a very good performance and can be easily manufactured with
   low cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bioluminescence imaging is widely used for cell-based assays and animal
   imaging studies in biomedical research and drug development,
   capitalizing on the high signal to background of this technique. A
   relatively small number of luciferases are available for imaging
   studies, substantially limiting the ability to image multiple molecular
   and cellular events, as done commonly with fluorescence imaging. To
   advance dual reporter bioluminescence molecular imaging, we tested a
   recently developed, adenosine triphosphate-independent luciferase enzyme
   from Oplophorus gracilirostris (NanoLuc {[}NL]) as a reporter for animal
   imaging. We demonstrated that NL could be imaged in superficial and deep
   tissues in living mice, although the detection of NL in deep tissues was
   limited by emission of predominantly blue light by this enzyme. Changes
   in bioluminescence from NL over time could be used to quantify tumor
   growth, and secreted NL was detectable in small volumes of serum. We
   combined NL and firefly luciferase reporters to quantify two key steps
   in transforming growth factor beta signaling in intact cells and living
   mice, establishing a novel dual luciferase imaging strategy for
   quantifying signal transduction and drug targeting. Our results
   establish NL as a new reporter for bioluminescence imaging studies in
   intact cells and living mice that will expand imaging of signal
   transduction in normal physiology, disease, and drug development.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation imaging has many applications ranging from health care to
   homeland security and defense, and source motion is present in many of
   these applications. When the motion profile of the source is known or
   otherwise estimated, one can use motion-compensation techniques to
   reduce blur in the reconstructed image. In this paper, we present a
   model-based source-intensity reconstruction in the energy and spatial
   domains using list-mode data. The model includes separate
   parameterization for objects moving with known motion that is
   independent of the stationary backdrop. This approach corrects for
   object motion without smearing stationary sources in the backdrop space.
   The goal is to simultaneously obtain an estimate of the incident energy
   and spatial distribution of the radiation field for the stationary
   backdrop and for each moving object. Experimental Compton-imaging
   results using an 18-detector array of 3-D-position-sensitive CdZnTe
   detectors show that the method can successfully reconstruct the source
   intensity of moving objects while also revealing stationary sources in
   the backdrop. Also, by modeling the possibility of partial photon energy
   deposition in the detector, the incident energy spectrum is
   reconstructed more accurately.}},

Abstract = {{We have characterized the microwave loss of high-Q parallel plate
   capacitors fabricated from thin-film Al/Al2O3/Re heterostructures on
   (0001) Al2O3 substrates. The superconductor-insulator-superconductor
   trilayers were grown in situ in a hybrid deposition system: the
   epitaxial Re base and polycrystalline Al counterelectrode layers were
   grown by sputtering, while the epitaxial Al2O3 layer was grown by pulsed
   laser deposition. Structural analysis indicates a highly crystalline
   epitaxial Al2O3 layer and sharp interfaces. The measured intrinsic
   (low-power, low-temperature) quality factor of the resonators is as high
   as 3 x 10(4). These results indicate that low-loss grown Al2O3 is an
   attractive candidate dielectric for high-fidelity superconducting qubit

Abstract = {{We have fabricated Fe-B thin film composition spreads in search of

Abstract = {{There is a growing number of resource-constrained small satellites that
   are currently performing and are proposed to accomplish novel science
   and technology missions. These missions seek to download large
   quantities of data to ground-station networks that currently have
   limited ability to support these missions. This limitation motivates the
   development of modeling and simulation tools to assess and optimize
   these mission scenarios. In this paper, we develop an extensible,
   analytical modeling framework for satellite operations. This framework
   captures dynamic states, subsystem functions, and interactions of the
   satellite with the external environment and ground-communication
   networks. This foundational framework enables assessment and
   optimization of complex space and ground networks under both
   deterministic and stochastic conditions. We apply this framework to
   develop a communication-focused model for an operational satellite
   mission. We implement the analytical model in a simulation environment
   and use realistic data from the surveyed small-satellite and
   ground-station community to assess the impact of satellite and network
   parameters on the potential for communication. Our simulations compare
   satellite downlink requirements and objectives with the constraint-based
   communication potential of diverse missions and ground networks. These
   results identify deficient and excess capabilities and motivate the need
   for optimal scheduling algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The degree of electron thermal nonequilibrium occurring in continuum,
   hypersonic, slender body, and blunt body flows is investigated. The
   effect of thermal nonequilibrium between the electron translational and
   vibrational-electronic modes on the predicted electron density and
   electron temperature is quantified at flight conditions characteristic
   of a slender hypersonic vehicle, as well as at a higher energy,
   superorbital flight condition of a blunt reentry vehicle. The most
   significant effect of electron thermal nonequilibrium on the flowfield
   is through the influence of the electron temperature on the magnitude of
   the chemical reaction rates in the high density shock layer. A twofold
   reduction in peak plasma density is predicted in the flow around the
   slender body when the electron nonequilibrium model is used, and this
   results in better agreement between the simulation results and the
   experimental electron density measurements. A change in the shape of the
   electron density profile with the use of the electron nonequilibrium
   model is predicted along the stagnation streamline of the blunt body
   flow. In both cases, the changes in predicted electron density are much
   more pronounced at the higher density flight conditions examined. In all
   cases, the rise of the electron temperature precedes the rise of the
   vibrational-electronic temperature along the stagnation streamline.
   These results have potentially important implications for the prediction
   of the onset of radio frequency blackout during the flights of next
   generation hypersonic vehicles, a phenomenon that is governed by the
   properties of the electron gas.}},

Abstract = {{We isolated the solid, aqueous-phase, and biocrude product fractions
   from the hydrothermal liquefaction of Nannochloropsis sp. and then
   further reacted each individually. These results permitted construction
   of a detailed reaction network for hydrothermal liquefaction that
   comprises the pathways for consumption and formation of each product
   fraction. We used the reaction network to develop a quantitative kinetic
   model and estimated its parameters using experimental results for the
   hydrothermal liquefaction of Nannochloropsis sp. at different
   temperatures and times. The model accurately predicted previously
   published biocrude and gas yields for the hydrothermal treatment of
   Nannochloropsis sp., though predictions became poorer further outside
   the experimental parameter space used to determine the model parameters.
   The reaction path between aqueous-phase products and heavy biocrude
   switches direction during the course of liquefaction. It initially
   produces aqueous-phase products, but after several minutes it consumes
   aqueous-phase products and produces heavy biocrude. The activation
   energies for the gas formation pathways (66 and 80 kJ/mol) are in good
   accord with the value (71 kJ/mol) estimated from literature for algae
   gasification in supercritical water {[}2]. The model predicts that the
   yields of light and heavy biocrudes are highest at temperatures >300
   degrees C and reaction times <20 min. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   separation generated on a coupled ring resonator system, the common-mode
   noise is suppressed by 2 orders of magnitude without any external
   noise-suppression techniques. In this work, we first carried out
   theoretical analysis to elucidate the sensing principle and then applied
   the SR-OFRR biosensor to experimentally detect bovine serum albumin with
   a concentration detection limit on the order of 1 pg/mL (similar to 15

Abstract = {{Water treatment technologies for arsenic removal from groundwater have
   been extensively studied due to widespread arsenic contamination of
   drinking water sources. Central to the successful application of arsenic
   water treatment systems is the consideration of appropriate disposal
   methods for arsenic-bearing wastes generated during treatment. However,
   specific recommendations for arsenic waste disposal are often lacking or
   mentioned as an area for future research and the proper disposal and
   stabilization of arsenic-bearing waste remains a barrier to the
   successful implementation of arsenic removal technologies. This review
   summarizes current disposal options for arsenic-bearing wastes,
   including landfilling, stabilization, cow dung mixing, passive aeration,
   pond disposal, and soil disposal. The findings from studies that
   simulate these disposal conditions are included and compared to results
   from shorter, regulatory tests. In many instances, short-term leaching
   tests do not adequately address the range of conditions encountered in
   disposal environments. Future research directions are highlighted and
   include establishing regulatory test conditions that align with actual
   disposal conditions and evaluating nonlandfill disposal options for
   developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{A novel algorithm is developed for feature selection and parameter
   tuning in quality monitoring of manufacturing processes using
   cross-validation. Due to the recent development in sensing technology,
   many on-line signals are collected for manufacturing process monitoring
   and feature extraction is then performed to extract critical features
   related to product/process quality. However, lack of precise process
   knowledge may result in many irrelevant or redundant features.
   Therefore, a systematic procedure is needed to select a parsimonious set
   of features which provide sufficient information for process monitoring.
   In this study, a new method for selecting features and tuning SPC limits
   is proposed by applying k-fold cross-validation to simultaneously select
   important features and set the monitoring limits using Type I and Type
   II errors obtained from cross-validation. The monitoring performance for
   production data collected from ultrasonic metal welding of batteries
   demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is able to select the most
   efficient features and control limits and thus leading to satisfactory
   monitoring performance. (C) 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

Abstract = {{A measure of product variety induced complexity has been proposed for
   mixed-model assembly systems with serial, parallel and hybrid

   In this paper, the existing complexity model is extended to general
   mixed-model assembly systems with non-identical parallel stations in the
   presence of product variety. Then it is discussed that how to reduce the
   system complexity using the variant differentiation, based on which a
   mathematical formulation is developed to minimize the complexity of a
   mixed-model assembly system. The formulated problem is a non-linear
   programming problem and then solved by genetic algorithm. Last the
   developed complexity mitigation model is applied to the configuration

Abstract = {{Closed loop manufacturing systems (CLMSs) with recirculating material
   handling devices are extensively used in various industrial
   environments. The performance of such systems is impacted by many
   factors such as the total capacity of pallets, the actual number of
   pallets in the system, the machine reliability and processing time, the
   pallet index speed, and the positions of loading/unloading points. These
   factors make the accurate analysis and optimization of complex CLMSs
   very difficult and challenging. This paper presents a new parameter
   coupling technique to model and analyze a wide range of CLMSs. It is an
   enhancement based on the existing open production line analysis with
   unreliable assembly machines and finite buffers. Virtual assembly
   machines are introduced to represent the specific phenomena of CLMSs
   such as the recirculation of empty pallets and the sharing of conveyor
   space. Two types of parameter coupling patterns, the machine parameter
   coupling, and the buffer capacity coupling, are introduced to reflect
   the characteristics of the CLMSs. The parameter coupling technique is
   simple and effective for analyzing a broad range of CLMSs. Comparisons
   between this analytic method and simulation experiments demonstrate that
   the proposed parameter coupling technique is fast, accurate and robust.

Abstract = {{A numerical study was conducted using the discrete element method (DEM)
   to investigate the performance and mobility impacts of rough terrain
   operation for small unmanned ground vehicles. The DEM simulation was
   validated using experimental data from two types of single-wheel tests
   previously published in the literature: straight-line locomotion over
   flat, level soil, and wheel-digging. Results from the validation showed
   good qualitative agreement. Rough terrain was modeled using 20
   sinusoidal profiles with varying frequency and amplitude. Straight-line
   single-wheel simulation test results for rough terrain showed decreases
   in mobility and efficiency compared to flat, level terrain. At low slip
   ratios average drawbar pull decreased as much as 15\%, while driving
   torque increased as much as 35\%. The frequency of the rough soil helped
   create oscillations in drawbar pull and driving torque, which
   significantly increased the span between minimum and maximum values. The
   impact of rough terrain was limited by the use of a low longitudinal
   velocity of 0.1 m/s and a soft lunar regolith simulant soil. Vertical
   accelerations that can lead to vehicle vibration, which have been shown
   to impact vehicle performance, were limited by the ease with which the
   wheel displaced soil. (C) 2013 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are branched water-soluble polymers
   defined by consecutive generation numbers (Gn) indicating a parallel
   increase in size, molecular weight, and number of surface groups
   available for conjugation of bioactive agents. In this article, we
   compare the biodistribution of N-acetylgalactosamine (NAcGal)-targeted
   {[}C-14](1)-G5-(NH2)(5)-(Ac)(108)-(NAcGal)(14) particles to non-targeted
   {[}C-14](1)-G5-(NH2)(127) and PEGylated
   {[}C-14](1)-G5-(NH2)(44)-(Ac)(73)-(PEG)(10) particles in a mouse hepatic
   cancer model. Results show that both NAcGal-targeted and non-targeted
   particles are rapidly cleared from the systemic circulation with high
   distribution to the liver. However, NAcGal-targeted particles exhibited
   2.5-fold higher accumulation in tumor tissue compared to non-targeted
   ones. In comparison, PEGylated particles showed a 16-fold increase in
   plasma residence time and a 5-fold reduction in liver accumulation.
   These results motivated us to engineer new PEGylated G5 particles with
   PEG chains anchored to the G5 surface via acid-labile cis-aconityl
   linkages where the free PEG tips are functionalized with NAcGal or SP94
   peptide to investigate their potential as targeting ligands for hepatic
   cancer cells as a function of sugar conformation ( versus ), ligand
   concentration (100-4000 nM), and incubation time (2 and 24 hours)
   compared to fluorescently (Fl)-labeled and non-targeted
   G5-(Fl)(6)-(NH2)(122) and G5-(Fl)(6)-(Ac)(107)-(cPEG)(15) particles.
   Results show G5-(Fl)(6)-(Ac)(107)-(cPEG{[}NAcGal])(14) particles achieve
   faster uptake and higher intracellular concentrations in HepG2 cancer
   cells compared to other G5 particles while escaping the non-specific
   adsorption of serum protein and phagocytosis by Kupffer cells, which
   make these particles the ideal carrier for selective drug delivery into
   hepatic cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing prevalence of using in-vehicle devices and mobile
   devices while driving, a major concern is their impact on driving
   performance and safety. However, the effects of cognitive load such as
   conversation on driving performance are still controversial and not well
   understood. In this study, an experiment was conducted to investigate
   the concurrent performance of vehicle lane keeping and speech
   comprehension tasks with improved experimental control of the
   confounding factors identified in previous studies. The results showed
   that the standard deviation of lane position (SDLP) was increased when
   the driving speed was faster (0.30 m at 36 km/h; 0.36 m at 72 km/h). The
   concurrent comprehension task had no significant effect on SDLP (0.34 m
   on average) or the standard deviation of steering wheel angle (SDSWA;
   5.20 degrees on average). The correct rate of the comprehension task was
   reduced in the dual-task condition (from 93.4\% to 91.3\%) compared with
   the comprehension single-task condition. Mental workload was
   significantly higher in the dual-task condition compared with the
   single-task conditions. Implications for driving safety were discussed.

Abstract = {{Long-chain acyl-CoA reductases (ACRs) catalyze a key step in the
   biosynthesis of hydrocarbon waxes. As such they are attractive as
   components in engineered metabolic pathways for drop in' biofuels. Most
   ACR enzymes are integral membrane proteins, but a cytosolic ACR was
   recently discovered in cyanobacteria. The ACR from
   Synechococcuselongatus was overexpressed in Escherichiacoli, purified
   and characterized. The enzyme was specific for NADPH and catalyzed the
   reduction of fatty acyl-CoA esters to the corresponding aldehydes,
   rather than alcohols. Stearoyl-CoA was the most effective substrate,
   being reduced more rapidly than either longer or shorter chain
   acyl-CoAs. ACR required divalent metal ions, e.g. Mg2+, for activity and
   was stimulated similar to 10-fold by K+. The enzyme was inactivated by
   iodoacetamide and was acylated on incubation with stearoyl-CoA,
   suggesting that reduction occurs through an enzyme-thioester
   intermediate. Consistent with this, steady state kinetic analysis
   indicates that the enzyme operates by a ping-pong' mechanism with
   k(cat)=0.36 +/- 0.023min(-1), Km (stearoyl-CoA)=31.9 +/- 4.2m and K-m
   (NADPH)=35.6 +/- 4.9m. The slow turnover number measured for ACR poses a
   challenge for its use in biofuel applications where highly efficient
   enzymes are needed.}},

   cyclic structures such as turbomachinery rotors. Accurate modeling of
   realistic industrial turbomachinery requires overcoming several
   challenges. The first is the excessively large size of the finite
   element models (FEMs) needed, which can contain millions of degrees of
   freedom per stage of the rotor. The second challenge is the presence of
   small random variations in the structural properties known as mistuning,
   which arise from operational wear and/or manufacturing tolerances, and
   destroy the cyclic symmetry of the FEMs. The third is the complexity of
   turbomachinery models, which often include multiple stages that often
   have a mismatched computational grid at the interface between stages.
   The fourth challenge is associated with modeling the aerodynamic loads
   on the turbomachinery rotor. Much research has been conducted to
   overcome the first two challenges. By combining cyclic symmetry analysis
   and component mode mistuning (CMM), compact single-stage reduced order
   models (ROMs) can be created to accurately capture the free and forced
   response of these systems. These highly efficient ROMs can be developed
   from single sector calculations and can be of the order of the number of
   sectors in the stage. Recently, the third challenge associated with the
   complexity of modeling multiple stages has been addressed by the
   authors. Their method uses cyclic symmetry and CMM to form single-stage
   ROMs (using only single sector models and single sector calculations),
   and then combines these single-stage ROMs by projecting the motion along
   the interface between stages along a set of harmonic shape functions.
   This method allows for the creation of compact ROMs of multi-stage
   systems with mistuning using sector only calculations. The fourth
   challenge has been addressed only for single-stage systems by computing
   a complex aerodynamic matrix (which contains stiffness and damping
   terms) using an iterative approach. In this work, some of the effects of
   the aerodynamics on multi-stage systems are explored. The methodology
   consists of first creating efficient structural ROMs of a multi-stage
   rotor using the method previously developed, and then iteratively
   calculating the complex aerodynamic matrices for each stage. A new way
   to account for the effects of a shift in frequency due to mistuning on
   the complex aerodynamic matrix is also proposed. Additionally, a new
   classification of complex multi-stage aeroelastic modes is introduced.
   The presented results focus on exploring the influences of the
   aerodynamics and mistuning on the multi-stage response. A variety of
   numerical results are analyzed for two stages of an industrial rotor.

Abstract = {{There is significant need for optical diagnostic techniques to measure
   instantaneous volumetric vector and scalar distributions in fluid flows
   and combustion processes. This is especially true for investigations
   where only limited optical access is available, such as in internal
   combustion engines, furnaces, flow reactors, etc. While techniques such
   as tomographic PIV for velocity measurement have emerged and reached a
   good level of maturity, instantaneous 3D measurements of scalar
   quantities are not available at the same level. Recently, developments
   in light field technology have progressed to a degree where
   implementation into scientific 3D imaging becomes feasible. Others have
   already demonstrated the utility of light field technology toward
   imaging high-contrast particles for PIV and for imaging flames when
   treated as single-surface objects. Here, the applicability and
   shortcomings of current commercially available light field technology
   toward volumetric imaging of translucent scalar distributions and flames
   are investigated. Results are presented from imaging canonical
   chemiluminescent and laser-induced fluorescent systems. While the
   current light field technology is able to qualitatively determine the
   position of surfaces by locating high-contrast features, the
   correlation-based reconstruction algorithm is unable to fully
   reconstruct the imaged objects for quantitative diagnostics. Current
   analysis algorithms are based on high-contrast correlation schemes, and
   new tools, possibly based on tomographic concepts, will have to be
   implemented to reconstruct the full 3D structure of translucent objects
   for quantitative analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) and
   electron temperature in low temperature gas discharge plasmas is
   analyzed in frames of local and non-local electron kinetics. It is
   shown, that contrary to the local case, typical for plasma in uniform
   electric field, there is the possibility for EEDF modification, at the
   condition of non-local electron kinetics in strongly non-uniform
   electric fields. Such conditions ``naturally{''} occur in some
   self-organized steady state dc and rf discharge plasmas, and they
   suggest the variety of artificial methods for EEDF modification. EEDF
   modification and electron temperature control in non-equilibrium
   conditions occurring naturally and those stimulated by different kinds
   of plasma disturbances are illustrated with numerous experiments. The
   necessary conditions for EEDF modification in gas discharge plasmas are

   with internal coil}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The effect of magnetic filtering on the electron energy distribution
   function is studied in an inductive discharge with internal coil
   coupling. The coil is placed inside the plasma and driven by a
   low-frequency power supply (5.8 MHz) which leads to a very high power
   transfer efficiency. A permanent dipole magnet may be placed inside the
   internal coil to produce a static magnetic field around 100 Gauss. The
   coil and the matching system are designed to minimize the capacitive
   coupling to the plasma. Capacitive coupling is quantified by measuring
   the radiofrequency (rf) plasma potential with a capacitive probe.
   Without the permanent magnet, the rf plasma potential is significantly
   smaller than the electron temperature. When the magnet is present, the
   rf plasma potential increases. The electron energy distribution function
   is measured as a function of space with and without the permanent
   magnet. When the magnet is present, electrons are cooled down to low
   temperature in the downstream region. This region of low electron
   temperature may be useful for plasma processing applications, as well as
   for efficient negative ion production. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Micromechanical experiments, image analysis, and theoretical modeling
   revealed that local failure events and compressive stresses of
   vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) were uniquely linked to
   relative density gradients. Edge detection analysis of systematically
   obtained scanning electron micrographs was used to quantify a
   microstructural figure-of-merit related to relative local density along
   VACNT heights. Sequential bottom-to-top buckling and hardening in
   stress-strain response were observed in samples with smaller relative
   density at the bottom. When density gradient was insubstantial or
   reversed, bottom regions always buckled last, and a flat stress plateau
   was obtained. These findings were consistent with predictions of a 2D
   material model based on a viscoplastic solid with plastic non-normality
   and a hardening-softening-hardening plastic flow relation. The hardening
   slope in compression generated by the model was directly related to the
   stiffness gradient along the sample height, and hence to the local
   relative density. These results demonstrate that a microstructural
   figure-of-merit, the effective relative density, can be used to quantify

Abstract = {{Copper chalcogenide nanoparticles (NPs) represent a promising material
   for solar energy conversion, electrical charge storage, and plasmonic
   devices. However, it is difficult to achieve high-quality NP dispersions
   in experimentally convenient and technologically preferred aqueous
   media. Also problematic is the transition from NP dispersion to
   continuously crystalline nanoscale materials, for instance, nanowires,
   nanoribbons, or similar high aspect ratio nano/microstructures capable
   of charge transport necessary for such applications. All previous
   examples of copper sulfide assemblies contained Insulating gaps between
   NPs. Here we show that aqueous synthesis of high-quality monodispersed
   high-chalcocite beta-Cu2S NPs, with sizes from 2 to 10 nm, is possible.
   When reaction time increased, the NP shape evolved from nearly spherical
   particles into disks with predominantly hexagonal shape. Moreover, the
   monodispersed beta-Cu2S NPs were found to spontaneously self-assemble
   into nanochains and, subsequently, to nanoribbons. The width and length
   of the nanoribbons were 4-20 nm and 50-950 nm, respectively, depending
   on the assembly conditions. We observed the formation of the nanoribbons
   with continuous crystal lattice and charge transport pathways, making
   possible the utilization of self-assembly processes In the manufacturing
   of photovoltaic, plasmonic, and charge storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that interface morphology affects the recombination
   rate for electrons and holes at donor acceptor heterojunctions in thin
   film organic photovoltaic cells. The optimal morphology is one where
   there is disorder at the heterointerface and order in the bulk of the
   thin films, maximizing both the short circuit current and open circuit
   voltage. We show that an amorphous, buried functionalized molecular
   squaraine donor layer can undergo an ``inverted{''} quasi-epitaxial
   growth during postdeposition processing, whereby crystallization is
   seeded by a subsequently deposited self-assembled nanocrystalline
   acceptor C-60 cap layer. We call this apparently unprecedented growth
   process from a buried interface ``inverse quasi-epitaxy{''} where the
   crystallites of these ``soft' van der Waals bonded materials are only
   approximately aligned to those of the cap. The resulting crystalline
   interface hastens charge recombination, thereby reducing the open
   circuit voltage in an organic photovoltaic cell. The lattice
   registration also facilitates interdiffusion of the squaraine donor and
   C-60 acceptor, which dramatically Improves the short circuit current. By
   controlling the extent to which this crystallization occurs, the voltage
   losses can be minimized, resulting in power conversion efficiencies of
   eta(p) = 5.4 +/- 0.3\% for single-junction and eta(p) = 8.3 +/- 0.4\%
   for tandem small-molecule photovoltaics. This is a general phenomenon
   with implications for all organic donor-acceptor junctions. That is,
   epitaxial relationships typically result in a reduction in open circuit
   voltage that must be avoided in both bilayer and bulk heterojunction
   organic photovoltaic cells.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was performed to determine the feasibility of
   measuring the elastic properties of the arterial wall in vivo. To prove
   this concept, elastic parameters were calculated from an aortic model of
   elastic behavior similar to a human aorta using computed tomography
   angiography (CTA) images.
   Methods: We first constructed an aortic model from polydimethylsiloxane
   (PDMS). This model was inserted into a pulsatile flow loop. The model
   was then placed inside a computed tomography scanner. To estimate the
   elasticity values, we measured the cross-sectional area and the pressure
   changes in the model during each phase of the simulated cardiac cycle. A
   discrete wavelet transform (DWT) algorithm was applied to the CTA data
   to calculate the geometric changes in the pulsatile model over a
   simulated cardiac cycle for various pulsatile rates and elasticity
   values of the PDMS material. The elastic modulus of the aortic model
   wall was derived from these geometric changes. The elastic moduli
   derived from the CTA data were compared with those obtained by testing
   strips of the same PDMS material in a tensile testing machine. Our two
   aortic models had elastic values at both extremes of those found in
   normal human aortas.
   Results: The results show a good comparison between the elastic values
   derived from the CIA data and those obtained in a tensile testing
   machine. In addition, the elasticity values were found to be independent
   of the pulsatile rate for mixing ratios of 6:1 and 9:1 (p=.12 and p=.22,
   respectively).
   Conclusions: The elastic modulus of a pulsatile aortic model may be
   measured by electrocardiographically-gated multi-detector CTA protocol.
   This preliminary study suggests the possibility of determining
   non-invasively the elastic properties of a living, functioning aorta
   using CIA data. (C) 2013 European Society for Vascular Surgery.

Abstract = {{This work describes investigations performed on the interaction of
   uniform current and freely rotating plate about a fixed vertical axis.
   Fluttering and autorotation are two different motions that may occur
   during the flow induced rotation. The dimensional analysis proves that
   the motion in flow induced rotation motion is governed essentially by
   the dimensionless moment of inertia and Reynolds number. Certain
   combinations define the stability boundaries between fluttering and
   autorotation. Fluttering is oscillation of body about a vertical axis
   and the autorotation is a name given to the case when the body turns
   continuously about the vertical axis. First, the loads and moment
   coefficients are calculated by experiments and streamline theory for
   different angles of attack for a fixed flat plate. Then for dynamic
   case, a bifurcation diagram is presented based on experiments to
   classify different motion states of flow induced rotation. Finally, a
   dynamical model is proposed for stability analysis of flow induced
   rotation of a flat plate.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the use of ultrasound speckle decorrelation- and
   correlation-based lateral speckle-tracking methods for transverse and
   longitudinal blood velocity profile measurement, respectively. By
   studying the blood velocity gradient at the vessel wall, vascular wall
   shear stress, which is important in vascular physiology as well as the
   pathophysiologic mechanisms of vascular diseases, can be obtained.
   Decorrelation-based blood velocity profile measurement transverse to the
   flow direction is a novel approach, which provides advantages for
   vascular wall shear stress measurement over longitudinal blood velocity
   measurement methods. Blood flow velocity profiles are obtained from
   measurements of frame-to-frame decorrelation. In this research, both
   decorrelation and lateral speckle-tracking flow estimation methods were
   compared with Poiseuille theory over physiologic flows ranging from 50
   to 1000 mm/s. The decorrelation flow velocity measurement method
   demonstrated more accurate prediction of the flow velocity gradient at
   the wall edge than the correlation-based lateral speckle-tracking
   method. The novelty of this study is that speckle decorrelation-based
   flow velocity measurements determine the blood velocity across a vessel.
   In addition, speckle decorrelation-based flow velocity measurements have
   higher axial spatial resolution than Doppler ultrasound measurements to
   enable more accurate measurement of blood velocity near a vessel wall
   and determine the physiologically important wall shear.}},

Abstract = {{Mixtures of anisotropic nanocrystals promise a great diversity of
   superlattices and phase behaviors beyond those of single-component
   systems. However, obtaining a colloidal shape alloy in which two
   different shapes are thermodynamically coassembled into a crystalline
   superlattice has remained a challenge. Here we present a joint
   experimental computational investigation of two geometrically ubiquitous
   nanocrystalline building blocks-nanorods and nanospheres-that overcome
   their natural entropic tendency toward macroscopic phase separation and
   coassemble into three intriguing pluses over centimeter scales,
   including an AB(2)-type binary superlattice. Monte Carlo simulations
   reveal that, although this shape alloy is entropically stable at high
   packing fraction, demixing is favored at experimental densities.
   Simulations with short-ranged attractive interactions demonstrate that
   the alloy is stabilized by interactions induced by ligand stabilizers
   and/or depletion effects. An asymmetry in the relative interaction
   strength between rods and spheres improves the robustness of the
   self-assembly process.}},

Title = {{Attomolar DNA detection with chiral nanorod assemblies}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Nanoscale plasmonic assemblies display exceptionally strong chiral
   optical activity. So far, their structural design was primarily driven
   by challenges related to metamaterials whose practical applications are
   remote. Here we demonstrate that gold nanorods assembled by the
   polymerase chain reaction into DNA-bridged chiral systems have promising
   analytical applications. The chiroplasmonic activity of side-by-side
   assembled patterns is attributed to a 7-9 degree twist between the
   nanorod axes. This results in a strong polarization rotation that
   matches theoretical expectations. The amplitude of the bisignate `wave'
   in the circular dichroism spectra of side-by-side assemblies
   demonstrates excellent linearity with the amount of target DNA. The
   limit of detection for DNA using side-by-side assemblies is as low as
   3.7 aM. The chiroplasmonic method may be particularly useful for
   biological analytes larger than 2-5 nm which are difficult to detect by
   methods based on plasmon coupling and `hot spots'. Circular polarization
   increases for inter-nanorod gaps between 2 and 20 nm when plasmonic
   coupling rapidly decreases. Reaching the attomolar limit of detection
   for simple and reliable bioanalysis of oligonucleotides may have a
   crucial role in DNA biomarker detection for early diagnostics of
   different diseases, forensics and environmental monitoring.}},

Title = {{Dynamic response and stability of a flapping foil in a dense and viscous
   fluid}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{It is important to understand and accurately predict the static and
   dynamic response and stability of flexible hydro/aero lifting bodies to
   ensure their structural safety, to facilitate the design/optimization of
   new/existing concepts, and to test the feasibility of using advanced
   materials. The present study investigates the influence of
   solid-to-fluid added mass ratio (root mu b) and viscous effects on the
   fluid-structure interaction (FSI) response and stability of a flapping
   foil in incompressible and turbulent flows using a recently presented
   efficient and stable numerical algorithm in time-domain, which couples
   an unsteady Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes solver with a two degrees-of
   freedom structural model. The new numerical coupling method is able to
   stably and accurately simulate the FSI behavior of light foils in dense
   fluids: a limit which is known to be numerically difficult to study with
   classical FSI coupling methods. The studied FSI responses include
   static/dynamic divergence and flutter instabilities, which are compared
   with inviscid, linear potential theory predictions obtained with both
   time and frequency domain formulations, as well as with several
   published experimental data. In general, the results show that the
   critical reduced flutter velocities and reduced divergence velocities
   both decrease as root mu b decreases, and are captured with good
   accuracy using the viscous FSI solver for a wide range of relative mass
   ratios that are typical to air/hydrofoils. The comparative analyses
   showed that the classic frequency-domain linear potential theory is
   severely unconservative for predicting the flutter velocity for cases
   with root mu b < 3: this includes the typical operating conditions of
   most marine and biomedical lifting devices, where the fluid forces are
   comparable to the solid forces, and strong nonlinear interactions may
   develop. In addition, the viscous FSI solver is shown to correctly
   predict the experimentally reported critical divergence speed of a light
   foil in a dense fluid for a case where the classical potential theory
   predicts an infinite divergence speed as the foil's elastic axis (E.A.)
   coincided with the aerodynamic center. The results show that
   static/dynamic divergence will occur before flutter for light hydrofoils
   with an E.A. downstream of the center of pressure. However, for high
   solid-to-fluid added mass ratios (root mu b > 2), flutter tends to occur
   prior to divergence. In addition, in between the regions governed by
   static divergence (root mu b < 1) and flutter (root mu b > 2), there is
   a dynamic divergence region, where the foil deformations oscillate with
   an increasing mean amplitude, and the oscillation frequency decreases
   toward zero as the deformation increases; this region could only be
   captured by using a viscous FSI solver. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Physical and numerical investigation of cavitating flows around a

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to investigate cavitating flows around a
   pitching hydrofoil via combined physical and numerical studies. The aims
   are to (1) improve the understanding of the interplay between unsteady
   cavitating flow, hydrofoil motion, and hydrodynamic performance, (2)
   quantify the influence of pitching rate on subcavitating and cavitating
   responses, and (3) quantify the influence of cavitation on the
   hydrodynamic load coefficients and surrounding flow structures. Results
   are presented for a NACA66 hydrofoil undergoing controlled, slow (alpha
   = 6 degrees/s) and fast (alpha = 63 degrees/s) pitching motions from
   alpha = 0 degrees to alpha = 15 degrees and back to alpha = 0 degrees
   for both subcavitating and cavitating conditions at a moderate Reynolds
   number of Re = 750 000. The experimental studies were conducted in a
   cavitation tunnel at the French Naval Academy, France. The numerical
   simulations are performed by solving the incompressible, multiphase
   Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations via the commercial
   code CFX using a transport equation-based cavitation model; a modified
   k-omega SST turbulence model is used to account for the effect of local
   compressibility on the turbulent eddy viscosity. The results showed that
   increases in the pitching rate suppressed laminar to turbulent
   transition, delayed stall, and significantly modified post-stall
   behavior. Cavitation inception at the leading edge modified the pressure
   distribution, which in turn significantly changed the interaction
   between leading edge and trailing edge vortices, and hence the magnitude
   as well as the frequency of the load fluctuations. For a fixed
   cavitation number, increases in pitching rate lead to increase in
   cavitation volume, which in turn changed the cavity shedding frequencies
   and significantly modified the hydrodynamic loads. Inversely, the
   leading edge cavitation observed for the low pitching velocity case
   tends to stabilize the stall because of the decrease of the pressure
   gradient due to the formation of the cavity. The results showed strong
   correlation between the cavity and vorticity structures, which suggest
   that the inception, growth, collapse and shedding of sheet/cloud
   cavities are important mechanisms for vorticity production and
   modification. (C) 2013 Author(s). All article content, except where

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the control of coupled bending and axial vibrations
   in L-shaped and portal planar frame structures. The controller is
   designed based on a wave standpoint, in which vibrations are described
   as waves traveling along uniform structural waveguides, and being
   reflected and transmitted at structural discontinuities. Active
   discontinuities are created using active control forces/moments both
   along structural elements and at structural joints to control vibration
   waves. The classical Euler-Bernoulli as well as the advanced Timoshenko
   bending theories are applied in modeling and controlling the flexural
   vibrations in planar frames. The axial vibrations are modeled using the
   elementary theory as it is typically valid for frequencies up to twice
   the cutoff frequency of Timoshenko bending waves. Results are compared
   between the two bending vibration theories. It is concluded that for
   relatively higher frequencies, typically when the transverse dimensions
   are not negligible with respect to the wavelength, the effects of rotary
   inertia and shear distortion must be taken into account for both
   vibration analysis and control design.}},

Abstract = {{Our previous studies demonstrated that BMP-2 inhibits the tumorigenicity
   of cancer stem cells identified as cells with high aldehyde
   dehydrogenase activity (ALDH(br) cells) from the human osteosarcoma cell
   line OS99-1. We further investigated whether BMP-2 is capable of
   inducing bone formation in OS99-1 cells. Flow cytometry sorting was used
   to isolate tumorigenic ALDH(br) and non-tumorigenic ALDH(lo) cells.
   qRT-PCR was used to quantify the gene expression. A xenograft model was
   used to verify the bone formation in vivo. There was significantly
   higher mRNA expression of BMPR1B and BMPR2 in ALDH(lo) cells compared
   with that in ALDH(br) cells and the BMPR1B expression in ALDH(lo) cells
   was similar to 8-fold higher compared to that in ALDH(br) cells. BMP-2
   was also found to induce higher transcription of osteogenic markers
   Runx-2, Osterix (Osx), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and collagen type I in
   ALDH(lo) cells compared to ALDH(br) cells, which were mediated by the
   canonical Smad signaling pathway. In vivo, BMP-2 was identified to
   induce bone formation in both ALDH(br) and ALDH(lo) cells. All animals
   receiving 1x10(4) ALDH(lo) cells treated with 30 mu g of BMP-2 per
   animal showed bone formation within 1-2 weeks after injection in mice.
   Bone formation induced by BMP-2 in ALDH(lo) cells showed significantly
   more bone mineral content compared to that in ALDH(br) cells. BMP-2
   induces bone formation in heterogeneous osteosarcoma cells and BMP-2 may
   have a promising therapeutic role for treating human osteosarcoma by
   inducing differentiation along an osteogenic pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Lower limb amputee gait during stance phase is related to the angular
   stiffness of the prosthetic foot, which describes the dependence of
   ankle torque on angular progression of the shank. However, there is
   little data on angular stiffness of prosthetic feet, and no method to
   directly measure it has been described. The objective of this study was
   to derive and evaluate a method to estimate the angular stiffness of
   prosthetic feet using a simple linear compression test. Linear vertical
   compression tests were performed on nine configurations of an
   experimental multicomponent foot (with known component stiffness
   properties and geometry), which allowed for parametric adjustment of
   hindfoot and forefoot stiffness properties and geometries. Each
   configuration was loaded under displacement control at distinct pylon
   test angles. Angular stiffness was calculated as a function of the pylon
   angle, normal force, and center of pressure (COP) rate of change with
   respect to linear displacement. Population root mean square error (RMSE)
   between the measured and predicted angular stiffness values for each
   configuration of the multicomponent foot was calculated to be 4.1
   N-m/deg, dominated by a bias of the estimated values above the predicted
   values of 3.8 +/- 1.6 N-m/deg. The best-fit line to estimated values was
   approximately parallel to the prediction, with R-2 = 0.95. This method
   should be accessible for a variety of laboratories to estimate angular
   stiffness of experimental and commercially available prosthetic feet
   with minimal equipment.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable cages have received increasing attention for their use in
   spinal procedures involving interbody fusion to resolve complications
   associated with the use of nondegradable cages, such as stress shielding
   and long-term foreign body reaction. However, the relatively weak
   initial material strength compared to permanent materials and subsequent
   reduction due to degradation may be problematic. To design a porous
   biodegradable interbody fusion cage for a preclinical large animal study
   that can withstand physiological loads while possessing sufficient
   interconnected porosity for bony bridging and fusion, we developed a
   multiscale topology optimization technique. Topology optimization at the
   macroscopic scale provides optimal structural layout that ensures
   mechanical strength, while optimally designed microstructures, which
   replace the macroscopic material layout, ensure maximum permeability.
   Optimally designed cages were fabricated using solid, freeform
   fabrication of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) mixed with hydroxyapatite.
   Compression tests revealed that the yield strength of optimized fusion
   cages was two times that of typical human lumbar spine loads.
   Computational analysis further confirmed the mechanical integrity within
   the human lumbar spine, although the pore structure locally underwent
   higher stress than yield stress. This optimization technique may be
   utilized to balance the complex requirements of load-bearing, stress
   shielding, and interconnected porosity when using biodegradable
   materials for fusion cages.}},

Abstract = {{Dense networks of low-cost wireless sensors have the potential to
   facilitate prolific data collection in large and complex infrastructure
   at costs lower than those historically associated with tethered
   counterparts. While wireless telemetry has been previously proposed for
   structural monitoring, comparatively less research has focused on the
   creation of a complete and scalable data management system that manages
   the storage and interrogation of wireless sensor data. This paper
   reports on the development of a novel wireless structural monitoring
   system specifically tailored for large-scale civil infrastructure
   systems by architecturally combining dense wireless sensor networks with
   a suite of information technologies remotely accessible by the Internet.
   The architectural overview of the proposed Internet-enabled wireless
   structural monitoring system is presented including a description of its
   functional elements (for example, wireless sensors, database server, and
   application programming interfaces). The monitoring-system architecture
   proposed is validated on the New Carquinez (Alfred Zampa Memorial)
   Bridge in Vallejo, California. A permanent wireless monitoring system is
   installed consisting of 28 wireless sensor nodes collecting data from
   over 80 channels. The bridge sensor data are transferred by a wireless
   cellular connection to a remote database server where it is stored and
   available for interrogation by software clients granted access to the
   data. To illustrate the ability to autonomously process the bridge
   response data, the stochastic subspace identification method is used to
   extract accurate modal characteristics of the bridge that are used to
   update high-fidelity finite-element models of the bridge. The
   Internet-enabled wireless structural monitoring system proved to be
   scalable to a large number of nodes and has thus far proven stable and
   reliable over long-term use.}},

Abstract = {{Cracks are a common occurrence in soil slopes, and a method is described
   for including the presence of cracks in stability assessment based on
   the kinematic approach of limit analysis. While many cracks may be
   present in a slope, the failure mechanism typically involves one crack,
   whose location has the most adverse influence on stability. A
   translational mechanism, typical of rock slope failures, is demonstrated
   to illustrate the method, followed by a rotation collapse analysis that
   is more appropriate for soils. Pre-existing (open) cracks are
   considered, as well as the cracks that form as part of the slope
   collapse mechanism. The maximum crack depth is determined by stability
   of the vertical crack boundary. This maximum crack depth may be reduced
   significantly by seepage forces in the slope. The most adverse location
   of the crack is determined from an optimization procedure where the
   minimum of the slope critical height is sought. The presence of water is
   included in the analysis, and stability charts are developed. The
   influence of the presence of cracks on stability of gentle slopes was
   not found to be significant, but the effect on the outcome of the
   analysis increases with an increase in inclination angle and the
   presence of pore-water pressure. The difference in the critical height
   of a 60 slope with an open crack and without one can be as much as 50\%.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Histotripsy is an extracorporeal therapeutic ultrasound (US)
   technology, where high-amplitude acoustic energy is applied to targeted
   tissue. Previous research has demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and
   effectiveness of histotripsy tissue homogenization and debulking of the
   prostate in the canine model. Before translating this technology for
   human use, it is prudent to examine the susceptibility of critical
   periprostatic structures to cavitation injury in the event of
   histotripsy mistargeting. In this study, we sought to characterize the
   tissue effects and biologic response of directly treating the bladder
   trigone with histotripsy. Materials and Methods: In eight anesthetized
   canines, 750,000 histotripsy pulses were applied uniformly across a
   2x1.5-cm area encompassing the bladder trigone and ureteral orifices.
   Prostate and bladder trigone were harvested immediately after treatment
   (2 subjects) or at 14 days (6 subjects). Flexible cystourethroscopy, US
   imaging, and creatinine levels were obtained at intervals until harvest,
   14 days after treatment. In one control subject, harvested at 2 days,
   the same treatment algorithm was applied to the prostate. Results:
   Transrectal US imaging revealed a cavitation bubble cloud on the surface
   of the bladder trigone and progressive development of tissue edema
   during treatment. Flexible cystourethroscopy immediately after treatment
   confirmed edema and erythema of the trigone. In the six subjects
   survived 2 weeks after treatment, one incidence of transient,
   self-limited ureteral obstruction was noted based on hydronephrosis and
   creatinine levels. At harvest, ureteral orifices were confirmed patent
   by passage of a guide wire. Histologic evaluation revealed hemorrhage
   acutely with mild localized fibrosis at 14 days. Conclusions: In this
   study, designed along the lines of a worst-case, destructive testing
   scenario, direct targeting of the bladder trigone with supratherapeutic
   histotripsy failed to induce significant tissue damage or clinical
   complication. These results are reassuring and will guide treatment
   strategy in upcoming human clinical trials of histotripsy treatment for
   benign prostatic hyperplasia.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{733}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Direct force measurements and qualitative flow visualization were used
   to compare flow field evolution versus lift and drag for a nominally
   two-dimensional rigid flat plate executing smoothed linear pitch ramp
   manoeuvres in a water tunnel. Non-dimensional pitch rate was varied from
   0.01 to 0.5, incidence angle from 0 to 90 degrees, and pitch pivot point
   from the leading to the trailing edge. For low pitch rates, the main
   unsteady effect is delay of stall beyond the steady incidence angle.
   Shifting the time base to account for different pivot points leads to
   collapse of both lift/drag history and flow field history. For higher
   rates, a leading edge vortex forms; its history also depends on pitch
   pivot point, but linear shift in time base is not successful in
   collapsing lift/drag history. Instead, a phenomenological algebraic
   relation, valid at the higher pitch rates, accounts for lift and drag
   for different rates and pivot points, through at least 45 degrees
   incidence angle.}},

Abstract = {{Structural health monitoring refers to the interdisciplinary engineering
   field whose objective is to monitor and evaluate the integrity of
   mechanical structures. Often times, structural health monitoring
   diagnostics utilize piezoelectric (lead zirconate titanate) transducers
   bonded to the surface of the structure monitored. Nonetheless,
   unexpected variations in the mechanical properties of the adhesive film
   could affect the dynamic behavior of the system and potentially
   mischaracterize the fitness for service of a structure. In this article,
   we presented an analytical model to describe the dynamic coupling
   between the structure and the lead zirconate titanate transducer that
   includes the adhesive layer. An electromechanical impedance-based method
   capable of assessing the integrity of the adhesive bondline was
   developed based on the proposed analytical model. Our study found that
   the phase angle of the transducer's electrical admittance was correlated
   to the mechanical impedance of the adhesive film following a power law
   behavior. Validation of the proposed model was carried out both by
   testing transducers bonded to aluminum plates and through a numerical
   parametric study. In the future, the method proposed could be used to
   detect preexisting defects in the adhesive bondline, to estimate the
   adhesive's thickness at manufacturing, and to monitor the degradation of
   the adhesive material during the life of the system.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a monolithic subsystem that integrates a microgas
   chromatography (mu GC) separation column and on-column, nondestructive
   Fabry-Perot (FP) vapor sensors on a single silicon chip. The device was
   fabricated using deep reactive ion etching of silicon to create fluidic
   channels and polymers were deposited on the same silicon chip to act as
   a stationary phase or an FP sensor, thus avoiding dead volumes caused by
   the interconnects between the column and sensor traditionally used in mu
   GC. Two integration designs were studied. In the first design, a 25-cm
   long mu GC column was coated with a layer of polymer that served as both
   the stationary phase and the FP sensor, which has the greatest level of
   integration. This design was capable of sub-second response times and
   detection limits under 10 ng. In the second design, an FP sensor array
   spray coated with different vapor sensing polymers was integrated with a
   30-cm long mu GC column, which significantly improves the system
   flexibility and detection sensitivity. With this design, we show that
   the FP sensors have a detection limit on the order of tens of picograms
   or similar to 500 ppb with a sub-second response time. Furthermore, the
   FP sensor array are shown to respond to a mixture of analytes separated
   by the integrated separation channel, allowing for the construction of
   response patterns, which, along with retention time, can be used as a
   basis of analyte identification. {[}2012-0305]}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to explore possible thermodynamic
   correlations between the degradation modes of austenitic and
   ferritic-martensitic alloys observed in high temperature He-CO-CO2
   environments with oxygen and carbon chemical potentials equivalent to
   that in a liquid sodium environment containing 2-5 molppm oxygen and
   0.02-0.2 molppm carbon at temperatures 500-700 degrees C. Two He-CO-CO2
   environments (PCO/PCO2 = 1320, PCO = 1980 molppm, and PCO/PCO2 = 9, PCO
   = 13.5 molppm) were selected to test alloys NF616 and 316L at 700 and
   850 degrees C. Upon exposure to He environments at 850 degrees C, 316L
   samples exhibited thick surface Cr2O3 scales and substantial internal
   oxidation; however at 700 degrees C no significant internal oxidation
   was observed. NF616 samples exhibited relatively thinner surface Cr2O3
   scales compared to 316L samples at both temperatures. NF616 samples
   exposed to liquid sodium at 700 degrees C and He-PCO/PCO2 = 9 at 850
   degrees C showed decarburization. No surface oxide formation was
   observed on the sample exposed to the Na environment. Results obtained
   from He exposure experiments provide insight into what may occur during
   long exposure times in a sodium environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An irradiation creep apparatus was developed for in situ straining of
   T91 strip samples while exposed to 2-3 MeV proton irradiation at 300-600
   degrees C. Thermal creep experiments were conducted at 600 degrees C, 47
   MPa, and 500 degrees C, 160 MPa. The thermal creep strains were in
   reasonable agreement with literature data on bulk samples of T91. An
   irradiation creep experiment was conducted at 500 degrees C and 160 MPa
   with a damage rate range from 3.1 x 10(-6) dpa/s to 4.9 x 10(-6) dpa/s.
   The creep rate of T91 was found to increase linearly with dose rate. A
   TEM investigation of the irradiated microstructure showed signs of
   dislocation pileup, subgrain formation, and small dislocation loops. The
   results illustrate the utility of accelerator-creep experiments to
   obtain creep rates at low dose and the capability to observe transient
   changes in real time, thus providing the tools for isolating the effects
   of individual variables on creep rate of T91. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This research investigates the positional accuracy and effects of
   transmitter orientation of a 3D electromagnetic tracking (EMT) system.
   EMT systems, capable of real-time position and orientation monitoring,
   are commonly used in computer-aided surgical navigation and path
   monitoring. In this study, positional information is evaluated for
   accuracy by comparing the EMT system against laser interferometer
   measurements in three orthogonal axes with step sizes between 0.1 and
   0.5 mm. The effect of transmitter orientation is evaluated by placing
   the transmitter with either the front or the side facing the magnetic
   sensor. Gauge repeatability and reproducibility results demonstrate that
   the EMT system can accurately measure the motion with a tolerance of 0.2
   mm with 0.5 s measurement time. The transmitter oriented with the front
   facing the sensor has a higher positional accuracy than that of the side
   transmitter orientation. High accuracy of the EMT system combined with
   the knowledge of transmitter orientation information presents the
   potential for accurate navigation and path monitoring in medical
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Skeletal muscles can be injured by lengthening contractions, when the
   muscles are stretched while activated. Lengthening contractions produce
   structural damage that leads to the degeneration and regeneration of
   damaged muscle fibers by mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated.
   Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated at the time of injury may
   initiate degenerative or regenerative processes. In the present study we
   hypothesized that lengthening contractions that damage the muscle would
   generate more ROS than isometric contractions that do not cause damage.
   To test our hypothesis, we subjected muscles of mice to lengthening
   contractions or isometric contractions and simultaneously monitored
   intracellular ROS generation with the fluorescent indicator
   5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (CM-DCFH), which
   is oxidized by ROS to form the fluorescent product CM-DCF. We found that
   CM-DCF fluorescence was not different during or shortly after
   lengthening contractions compared with isometric controls, regardless of
   the amount of stretch and damage that occurred during the lengthening
   contractions. The only exception was that after severe stretches, the
   increase in CM-DCF fluorescence was impaired. We conclude that
   lengthening contractions that damage the muscle do not generate more ROS
   than isometric contractions that do not cause damage. The implication is
   that ROS generated at the time of injury are not the initiating signals
   for subsequent degenerative or regenerative processes.}},

Abstract = {{A self-assembled gold nanoparticle surface patterning technique is
   presented that enables nanometer spatial resolution for digital image
   correlation (DIC) experiments in a scanning electron microscope. This
   technique, originally developed for surface-enhanced Raman scattering
   substrates, results in the assembly of individual 15-136 nm diameter
   gold nanoparticles over the surface of the test sample. The resulting
   dense, randomly isotropic, and high contrast pattern enables DIC down to
   an unprecedented image resolution of approximately 4 nm/pixel. The
   technique is inexpensive, fast, results in even coverage over the entire
   surface of the test sample, and can be applied to metallic and
   non-metallic substrates as well as curved or delicate specimens. In
   addition, the pattern is appropriate for multi-scale experimental
   investigations through the utilization of nanoparticle aggregates that
   collect on the surface in combination with the pattern formed by
   individual nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{The underlying fiber architecture of soft tissues, like bat wing skin,
   plays an important role in the material's overall mechanical behavior.
   The mesoscopic birefringent fiber architecture of the bat wing skin can
   be visualized directly under polarized light. This inherent property is
   the key to the new experimental technique developed in this work:
   polarized image correlation (PIC). PIC is a technique for determining
   full field material strains and fiber kinematics of mesoscopically
   resolved fibrous tissues during biaxial mechanical testing. Not only is
   the material birefringence used to determine fiber kinematics under
   finite deformations, but it is also used for image correlation and
   strain field computation. Pure translation tests performed with PIC
   verify the accuracy of the technique. A segmental image processing
   method was developed to solve an experimental issue of changing
   birefringent properties to construct accurate continuous deformation
   profiles. By integrating PIC with traditional digital image correlation,
   both surface and subsurface data give additional insight into through
   thickness tissue behavior. The PIC technique is applicable to
   semi-transparent tissues with birefringent mesosopic structures;
   incorporation of microscopy would resolve smaller fiber structures.
   Future work includes extending the techniques to three dimensions to
   analyze curved surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{In manufacturing systems, many maintenance tasks require equipment to be
   locked out for safety. However, such stoppage might directly cause
   short-term production losses although maintenance is performed to
   increase the long-term system reliability. In this paper, we investigate
   how long we can strategically stop equipment for maintenance during
   production operating without affecting system throughput. We extend the
   concept of maintenance opportunity windows (MOWs) to various system
   configurations and introduce a new concept of group maintenance
   opportunity windows (GMOWs). GMOW is the maximum time window that allows
   to perform a group maintenance without jeopardizing the flow of a
   production line. Moreover, we also provide how to calculate MOW and GMOW
   via simulations which can deal with uncertainties in production lines,
   such as random machine failures, starvations, blockages, etc.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops a thermal model utilizing the inverse heat transfer
   method (IHTM) to investigate the bone grinding temperature created by a
   spherical diamond tool used for skull base neurosurgery. Bone grinding
   is a critical procedure in the expanded endonasal approach to remove the
   cranial bone and access to the skull base tumor via nasal corridor. The
   heat is generated during grinding and could damage the nerve or
   coagulate the blood in the carotid artery adjacent to the bone. The
   finite element analysis is adopted to investigate the grinding-induced
   bone temperature rise. The heat source distribution is defined by the
   thermal model, and the temperature distribution is solved using the IHTM
   with experimental inputs. Grinding experiments were conducted on a
   bovine cortical bone with embedded thermocouples. Results show
   significant temperature rise in bone grinding. Using 50 degrees C as the
   threshold, the thermal injury can propagate about 3 mm in the traverse
   direction, and 3 mm below the ground surface under the dry grinding
   condition. The presented methodology demonstrated the capability of
   being a thermal analysis tool for bone grinding study. (C) 2013 IPEM.

Title = {{Temperature prediction in high speed bone grinding using motor PWM

Abstract = {{This research explores the feasibility of using motor electrical
   feedback to estimate temperature rise during a surgical bone grinding
   procedure. High-speed bone grinding is often used during skull base
   neurosurgery to remove cranial bone and approach skull base tumors
   through the nasal corridor. Grinding-induced heat could propagate and
   potentially injure surrounding nerves and arteries, and therefore,
   predicting the temperature in the grinding region would benefit
   neurosurgeons during the operation. High-speed electric motors are
   controlled by pulse-width-modulation (PWM) to alter the current input
   and thus maintain the rotational speed. Assuming full mechanical to
   thermal power conversion in the grinding process, PWM can be used as
   feedback for heat generation and temperature prediction. In this study,
   the conversion model was established from experiments under a variety of
   grinding conditions and an inverse heat transfer method to determine
   heat flux. Given a constant rotational speed, the heat conversion was
   represented by a linear function, and could predict temperature from the
   experimental data with less than 20\% errors. Such results support the
   advance of this technology for practical application. (C) 2013 IPEM.

Abstract = {{We present a census of z(abs) less than or similar to 2 intrinsic (those
   showing partial coverage) and associated (z(abs) similar to z(em))
   quasar absorption-line systems detected in the Hubble Space Telescope
   archive of Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph echelle spectra. This
   work complements the Misawa et al. survey of 2 < z(em) < 4 quasars that
   selects systems using similar techniques. We confirm the existence of
   so-called strong N v intrinsic systems (where the equivalent width of H
   i Ly alpha is small compared to N v lambda 1238) presented in that work,
   but find no convincing cases of `strong C iv' intrinsic systems at low
   redshift/luminosity. Moreover, we also report on the existence of
   `strong O vi' systems. From a comparison of partial coverage results as
   a function of ion, we conclude that systems selected by the N v ion have
   the highest probability of being intrinsic. By contrast, the C iv and O
   vi ions are poor selectors. Of the 30 O vi systems tested, only two of
   the systems in the spectrum on 3C 351 show convincing evidence for
   partial coverage. However, there is an similar to 3 Sigma excess in the
   number of absorbers near the quasar redshift (vertical bar delta v
   vertical bar < 5000 km s(-1)) over absorbers at large redshift
   differences. In at least two cases, the associated O vi systems are
   known not to arise close to the accretion disc of the quasar.}},

Abstract = {{The spread of cancer throughout the body is driven by circulating tumour
   cells (CTCs)(1). These cells detach from the primary tumour and move
   from the bloodstream to a new site of subsequent tumour growth. They
   also carry information about the primary tumour and have the potential
   to be valuable biomarkers for disease diagnosis and progression, and for
   the molecular characterization of certain biological properties of the
   tumour. However, the limited sensitivity and specificity of current
   methods for measuring and studying these cells in patient blood samples
   prevents the realization of their full clinical potential. The use of
   microfluidic devices is a promising method for isolating CTCs2,3.
   However, the devices are reliant on three-dimensional structures, which
   limits further characterization and expansion of cells on the chip. Here
   we demonstrate an effective approach to isolating CTCs from blood
   samples of pancreatic, breast and lung cancer patients, by using
   functionalized graphene oxide nanosheets on a patterned gold surface.
   CTCs were captured with high sensitivity at a low concentration of
   target cells (73 +/- 32.4\% at 3-5 cells per ml blood).}},

Journal = {{PHARMACOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) are G protein-coupled receptors
   that transmit cellular responses to extracellular proteases and have
   important functions in vascular physiology, development, inflammation,
   and cancer progression. The established paradigm for PAR activation
   involves proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular N terminus, which
   reveals a new N terminus that functions as a tethered ligand by binding
   intramolecularly to the receptor to trigger transmembrane signaling.
   Most cells express more than one PAR, which can influence the mode of
   PAR activation and signaling. Clear examples include murine PAR3
   cofactoring of PAR4 and transactivation of PAR2 by PAR1. Thrombin binds
   to and cleaves murine PAR3, which facilitates PAR4 cleavage and
   activation. This process is essential for thrombin signaling and
   platelet activation, since murine PAR3 cannot signal alone. Although
   PAR1 and PAR4 are both competent to signal, PAR1 is able to act as a
   cofactor for PAR4, facilitating more rapid cleavage and activation by
   thrombin. PAR1 can also facilitate PAR2 activation through a different
   mechanism. Cleavage of the PAR1 N terminus by thrombin generates a
   tethered ligand domain that can bind intermolecularly to PAR2 to
   activate signaling. Thus, PARs can regulate each other's activity by
   localizing thrombin when in complex with PAR3 and PAR4 or by cleaved
   PAR1, providing its tethered ligand domain for PAR2 activation. The
   ability of PARs to cofactor or transactivate other PARs would
   necessitate that the two receptors be in close proximity, likely in the
   form of a heterodimer. Here, we discuss the cofactoring and dimerization
   of PARs and the functional consequences on signaling.}},

Title = {{Detoxification of Mercury by Methanobactin from Methylosinus

Abstract = {{Many methanotrophs have been shown to synthesize methanobactin, a novel
   biogenic copper-chelating agent or chalkophore. Methanobactin binds
   copper via two heterocyclic rings with associated enethiol groups. The
   structure of methanobactin suggests that it can bind other metals,
   including mercury. Here we report that methanobactin from Methylosinus
   trichosporium OB3b does indeed bind mercury when added as HgCl2 and, in
   doing so, reduced toxicity associated with Hg(II) for both
   Alpha-proteobacteria methanotrophs, including M. trichosporium OB3b, M.
   trichosporium OB3b Delta mbnA (a mutant defective in methanobactin
   production), and Methylocystis sp. strain SB2, and a Gammaproteobacteria
   methanotroph, Methylomicrobium album BG8. Mercury binding by
   methanobactin was evident in both the presence and absence of copper,
   despite the fact that methanobactin had a much higher affinity for
   copper due to the rapid and irreversible binding of mercury by
   methanobactin. The formation of a gray precipitate suggested that
   Hg(II), after being bound by methanobactin, was reduced to Hg(0) but was
   not volatilized. Rather, mercury remained associated with methanobactin
   and was also found associated with methanotrophic biomass. It thus
   appears that although the mercury-methanobactin complex was cell
   associated, mercury was not removed from methanobactin. The amount of
   biomass-associated mercury in the presence of methanobactin from M.
   trichosporium OB3b was greatest for M. trichosporium wild-type strain
   OB3b and the Delta mbnA mutant and least for M. album BG8, suggesting
   that methanotrophs may have selective methanobactin uptake systems that
   may be based on TonB-dependent transporters but that such uptake systems
   exhibit a degree of infidelity.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{783-796}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers sequential adaptive estimation of sparse signals
   under a constraint on the total sensing effort. The advantage of
   adaptivity in this context is the ability to focus more resources on
   regions of space where signal components exist, thereby improving
   performance. A dynamic programming formulation is derived for the
   allocation of sensing effort to minimize the expected estimation loss.
   Based on the method of open-loop feedback control, allocation policies
   are then developed for a variety of loss functions. The policies are
   optimal in the two-stage case, generalizing an optimal two-stage policy
   proposed by Bashan et al., and improve monotonically thereafter with the
   number of stages. Numerical simulations show gains up to several dB as
   compared to recently proposed adaptive methods, and dramatic gains
   compared to non-adaptive estimation. An application to radar imaging is
   also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a tool for noninvasive
   stimulation of neuronal tissue used for research in cognitive
   neuroscience and to treat neurological disorders. Many TMS applications
   call for large electric fields to be sharply focused on regions that
   often lie deep inside the brain. Unfortunately, the fields generated by
   present-day TMS coils diffuse and decay rapidly as they penetrate into
   the head. As a result, they tend to stimulate relatively large regions
   of tissue near the brain surface. Earlier studies suggested that a
   focused TMS excitation can be attained using multiple nonuniformly fed
   coils in a multichannel array. We propose a systematic, genetic
   algorithm-based technique for synthesizing multichannel arrays that
   minimize the volume of the excited region required to achieve a
   prescribed penetration depth and maintain realistic values for the input
   driving currents. Because multichannel arrays are costly to build, we
   also propose a method to convert the multichannel arrays into
   single-channel ones while minimally materially deteriorating
   performance. Numerical results show that the new multi-and
   single-channel arrays stimulate tissue 2.4 cm into the head while
   exciting 3.0 and 2.6 times less volume than conventional Figure-8 coils,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A single-letter achievable rate region is proposed for the two-receiver
   discrete memoryless broadcast channel with generalized feedback. The
   coding strategy involves block-Markov superposition coding using
   Marton's coding scheme for the broadcast channel without feedback as the
   starting point. If the message rates in the Marton scheme are too high
   to be decoded at the end of a block, each receiver is left with a list
   of messages compatible with its output. Resolution information is sent
   in the following block to enable each receiver to resolve its list. The
   key observation is that the resolution information of the first receiver
   is correlated with that of the second. This correlated information is
   efficiently transmitted via joint source-channel coding, using ideas
   similar to the Han-Costa coding scheme. Using the result, we obtain an
   achievable rate region for the stochastically degraded additive white
   Gaussian noise broadcast channel with noisy feedback from only one
   receiver. It is shown that this region is strictly larger than the
   no-feedback capacity region.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Optogenetics promises exciting neuroscience research by
   offering optical stimulation of neurons with unprecedented temporal
   resolution, cell-type specificity and the ability to excite as well as
   to silence neurons. This work provides the technical solution to deliver
   light to local neurons and record neural potentials, facilitating local
   circuit analysis and bridging the gap between optogenetics and
   neurophysiology research. Approach. We have designed and obtained the
   first in vivo validation of a neural probe with monolithically
   integrated electrodes and waveguide. High spatial precision enables
   optical excitation of targeted neurons with minimal power and recording
   of single-units in dense cortical and subcortical regions. Main results.
   The total coupling and transmission loss through the dielectric
   waveguide at 473 nm was 10.5 +/- 1.9 dB, corresponding to an average
   output intensity of 9400 mW mm(-2) when coupled to a 7 mW optical fiber.
   Spontaneous field potentials and spiking activities of multiple
   Channelrhodopsin-2 expressing neurons were recorded in the hippocampus
   CA1 region of an anesthetized rat. Blue light stimulation at intensity
   of 51 mW mm(-2) induced robust spiking activities in the physiologically
   identified local populations. Significance. This minimally invasive,
   complete monolithic integration provides unmatched spatial precision and
   scalability for future optogenetics studies at deep brain regions with
   high neuronal density.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Structural monitoring for civil infrastructure is a rapidly developing
   field that has made significant advancements over the last decade.
   However, a number of performance bottlenecks remain including challenges
   with cost-effectively scaling monitoring systems up to large nodal
   counts. Due to the many parallels between biological sensory systems and
   engineered sensing systems, the biological nervous system can offer
   potential solutions to the current deficiencies of structural monitoring
   systems. The nervous system is capable of real-time processing and data
   transmission of external stimuli through an extremely condensed format
   with very basic processing units. This study explores the mammalian
   auditory system for inspiration because it achieves efficient data
   acquisition processes that outperform existing engineered sensing
   systems. Specifically, the auditory system realizes this through three
   steps: (1) real-time decomposition of a convoluted time-based signal
   into frequency components, (2) information compression for each
   component, and (3) efficient high-speed data transmission to the
   auditory cortex. In this paper, these three main mechanisms are explored
   and a bio-inspired structural monitoring system is proposed. The
   functionality of the proposed system is compared to traditional data
   compression techniques (wavelet transforms and compressed sensing) on
   various vibratory signals. While the wavelet transform is able to
   outperform the proposed sensor by minimizing signal reconstruction
   errors, the proposed bio-inspired sensor achieves similar compression
   rates but, unlike the others, does so using real-time processing.}},

Abstract = {{The acoustic and thermal properties as well as the temperature change
   within a tissue volume during high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation
   are critically important for treatment planning and monitoring.
   Described in this article is a tomographic reconstruction method used to
   determine the tissue properties and increase in temperature in a 3-D
   volume. On the basis of the iterative finite-element solution to the
   bioheat equation coupled with Tikhonov regularization techniques, our
   reconstruction algorithm solves the inverse problem of bioheat transfer
   and uses the time-dependent temperature measured on a tissue surface to
   obtain the acoustic absorption coefficient, thermal diffusivity and
   temperature increase within the subsurface volume. Numerical simulations
   were performed to validate the reconstruction algorithm. The method was
   initially conducted in ex vivo experiments in which time-dependent
   temperature on a tissue surface was measured using high-resolution,
   non-invasive infrared thermography. (E-mail: hjiang@bme.ufl.edu and

Abstract = {{Cables (or wire ropes) made from NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA). wires
   are relatively new and unexplored structural elements that combine many
   of the advantages of conventional cables with the adaptive properties of
   SMAs (shape memory and superelasticity) and have a broad range of
   potential applications. In this two part series, an extensive set of
   uniaxial tension experiments was performed on two Nitinol cable
   constructions, a 7 x 7 right regular lay and a 1 x 27 alternating lay,
   to characterize their superelastic behavior in room temperature air.
   Details of the evolution of strain and temperature fields were captured
   by simultaneous stereo digital image correlation and infrared imaging,
   respectively. Here in Part I, the nearly isothermal, superelastic
   responses of the two cable designs are presented and compared. Overall,
   the 7 x 7 construction has a mechanical response similar to that of
   straight wires with propagating transformation fronts and distinct
   stress plateaus during stress-induced transformations. The 1 x 27
   construction, however, exhibits a more compliant and stable mechanical
   response, trading a decreased force for additional elongation, and does
   not exhibit transformation fronts due to the deeper helix angles of the
   layers. In Part II that follows, selected subcomponents are dissected
   from the two cable's hierarchical constructions to experimentally break
   down the cable's responses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper constitutes the second part of our experimental study of the
   thermo-mechanical behavior of superelastic NiTi shape memory alloy
   cables. Part I introduced the fundamental, room temperature, tensile
   responses of two cable designs (7 x 7 right regular lay, and 1 x 27
   alternating lay). In Part II, each cable behavior is studied further by
   breaking down the response into the contributions of its hierarchical
   subcomponents. Selected wire strands were extracted from the two cable
   constructions, and their quasi-static tension responses were measured
   using the same experimental setup of Part I. Consistent with the shallow
   wire helix angles in the 7 x 7 construction, the force-elongation
   responses of the core wire, 1 x 7 core strand and full 7 x 7 cable were
   similar on a normalized basis, with only a slight decrease in
   transformation force plateaus and slight increase in plateau strains in
   this specimen sequence. By contrast, each successive 1 x 27 component (1
   x 6 core strand, 1 x 15 strand, and full cable) included an additional
   outer layer of wires with a larger number of wires, greater helix
   radius, and deeper helix angle, so the normalized axial load responses
   became significantly more compliant. Each specimen in the sequence also
   exhibited progressively larger strains at failure, reaching 40\% strain
   in the full 1 x 27 cable.
   Stress-induced phase transformations involved localized
   strain/temperature and front propagation in all of the tested 7 x 7
   components but none of the 1 x 27 components aside from the 1 x 27 core
   wire. Stereo digital image correlation measurements revealed finer
   features within a global transformation front of the 1 x 7 core strand
   than the 7 x 7 cable, consisting of an staggered pattern of individual
   wire fronts that moved in lock-step during elongation. Although the 1 x
   27 multi-layer strands exhibited temperature/strain localizations in a
   distributed pattern during transformations, the localizations did not
   propagate and their cause was traced back to contact indentations
   (stress concentrations) arising from the cable's fabrication. The
   normalized axial torque responses of the multi-layer 1 x 27 components
   during transformation were distinctly non-monotonic and complex, due to
   the alternating handedness of the layers. Force and torque contributions
   of individual wire layers were deduced by subtracting 1 x 27 component
   responses, which helped to clarify the transformation kinetics within
   each layer and explain the unusual force and torque-undulations seen in
   the 1 x 27 cable response of Part I. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of fuel oxygen on the trade-offs between soot, nitric oxides
   (NOx) and combustion efficiency in a premixed low-temperature combustion
   (LTC) mode using boost, single late injection and cooled exhaust gas
   recirculation (EGR) is investigated in a single cylinder diesel engine.
   NOx, carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are dominated
   by intake dilution level (EGR rate), and not affected by fuel oxygen.
   For fuels with 0\% and 7\% fuel oxygen, soot exhibits a maximum at
   moderate intake dilution. When high intake dilution is used to reduce
   soot, combustion efficiency drops, demonstrating a soot versus
   combustion efficiency trade-off. When fuel oxygen is increased to 15\%,
   soot is very low (maximum filter smoke number (FSN) < 0.15) at all test
   EGR dilution levels. Thus, a defeat of the NOx versus soot trade-off is
   realized, and low NOx, low soot and high combustion efficiency are
   achieved at moderate intake dilution using fuel with 15\% oxygen. (C)

Abstract = {{Sintered stainless steel fiber felt (SSSFF) is a type of cellular
   material promising for functional and structural applications due to
   high porosity, controllable permeability, and high specific surface
   area, etc. In this study, a micromechanics elastic-plastic constitutive
   model was proposed for accurate representation of material behavior of
   SSSFF. Firstly, microscopic geometric structure was investigated and
   representative volume element (RVE) was established according to the
   reasonable simplifications and assumptions. Secondly, fundamental
   equations of elastic theory including equilibrium equations and
   geometric equations were built. Principle of virtual work and
   generalized Hook's law were applied to obtain the elastic behavior. The
   incremental theory was adopted to derive the plastic stress-strain
   relations. Thirdly, the elastic and plastic relations were unified by
   statistical theory considering the fiber length and fiber orientation
   distribution. Finally, four SSSFF materials were introduced as numerical
   examples and the numerical results show good agreements with
   experimental results. The proposed micromechanics constitutive model,
   also expected to be applicable to other metal fiber sintered materials,
   is beneficial to predict the mechanical properties of sintered fiber
   materials and guide the material design. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the electronic and thermodynamic properties of Zr and its
   oxides from first principles to elucidate phase stability in the Zr-O
   system. Hexagonally close-packed Zr is unusual in its ability to
   dissolve very high concentrations of oxygen over its interstitial
   octahedral sites, forming a variety of ordered suboxides that undergo
   both first-order and second-order phase transitions upon heating. We
   perform a first-principles, statistical-mechanical analysis of finite
   temperature phase stability of ZrOx using a cluster expansion
   Hamiltonian and Monte Carlo calculations. This analysis predicts the
   existence of 0-K ground-state oxygen orderings at composition ZrO1/6,
   ZrO2/9, ZrO1/3, ZrO4/9, and ZrO1/2 along with evidence of an infinite
   sequence of ground-state suboxide orderings at intermediate oxygen
   concentrations consisting of different stackings of empty, 1/3-filled
   and 2/3-filled two-dimensional oxygen layers. We also predict the
   stability of a previously uncharacterized Zr-monoxide phase, which we
   label delta'-ZrO due to its crystallographic relation to delta-TiO. The
   delta'-ZrO structure is equivalent to the high-pressure omega-Zr phase
   but has interstitial oxygen ordering. Finally, as part of the technical
   implementation of our statistical mechanical study, we introduce a new
   algorithm to parametrize the coefficients of a cluster expansion
   Hamiltonian and apply a k-space analysis to rigorously track
   order-disorder phenomena at finite temperature.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{170}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{401-413}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Ultrasound application in the presence of microbubbles has shown great
   potential for non-viral gene transfection via transient disruption of
   cell membrane (sonoporation). However, improvement of its efficiency has
   largely relied on empirical approaches without consistent and
   translatable results. The goal of this study is to develop a rational
   strategy based on new results obtained using novel experimental
   techniques and analysis to improve sonoporation gene transfection. In
   this study, we conducted experiments using targeted microbubbles that
   were attached to cell membrane to facilitate sonoporation. We quantified
   the dynamic activities of microbubbles exposed to pulsed ultrasound and
   the resulting sonoporation outcome, and identified distinct regimes of
   characteristic microbubble behaviors: stable cavitation, coalescence and
   translation, and inertial cavitation. We found that inertial cavitation
   generated the highest rate of membrane poration. By establishing direct
   correlation of ultrasound-induced bubble activities with intracellular
   uptake and pore size, we designed a ramped pulse exposure scheme for
   optimizing microbubble excitation to improve sonoporation gene
   transfection. We implemented a novel sonoporation gene transfection
   system using an aqueous two phase system (ATPS) for efficient use of
   reagents and high throughput operation. Using plasmids coding for the
   green fluorescence protein (GFP), we achieved a sonoporation
   transfection efficiency in rate aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) of
   6.9\% +/- 2.2\% (n = 9), comparable with lipofection (7.5\% +/- 0.8\%, n
   = 9). Our results reveal characteristic microbubble behaviors
   responsible for sonoporation and demonstrated a rational strategy to
   improve sonoporation gene transfection. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{We recently showed that a suspension of micrometer-sized polystyrene
   (PS) particles in a PDMS liquid, mixed with small (1 wt \%) amounts of a
   nanocage, sulfonated polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (s-POSS),
   exhibited significant electrorheological (ER) behavior. This behavior
   was associated with the formation of a thin adsorbed layer of s-POSS
   onto the surfaces of PS and the subsequent formation of
   polarization-induced aggregates, or structures, responsible for the ER
   effect in an applied electric, E, field. Current theory suggests that
   the ER effect would largely be determined by the dielectric and
   conductive properties of the conductive layer of core/shell particles in
   ER suspensions. We show here that sulfonated-PS (s-PS)/PDMS suspensions
   exhibit further increases in the yield stress of over 200\%, with the
   addition of s-POSS. The yield stress of this system, moreover, scales as
   tau(y) proportional to E-2. The dielectric relaxation studies reveal the
   existence of a new relaxation peak in the s-POSS/s-PS/PDMS system that
   is absent in the s-POSS/PS/PDMS suspension. The relative sizes of these
   peaks are sensitive to the concentration of s-POSS and are associated
   with changes in the ER behavior. The properties of this class of ER
   fluids are not appropriately rationalized in terms of current theories.}},

   4)alpha, one-to-one conversion from In islands to InAs QDs is observed.
   For c(4 x 4)beta, lower densities of larger QDs are observed, presumably
   due to enhanced In surface diffusion in the absence of metastable Ga-As
   dimers. For the As capped surface, In deposition leads to an amorphous
   film, from which QDs nucleate by SPE during annealing. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{New advances in plastic scintillation compositions have opened the field
   to new, exciting instruments capable of neutron-gamma ray pulse shape
   discrimination (PSD). We present PSD figure of merit parameters and
   neutron time-of-flight from Cf-252 using a 5.08-cm diameter by 5.08-cm
   thick sample of PSD-capable plastic scintillator EJ-299-33 and compare
   these results to those from a same-sized EJ-309 liquid scintillator
   detector. An offline, digital PSD method was applied to both detectors.
   The results show that EJ-299-33 plastic PSD is very good, having a
   figure of merit of approximately 0.9 for 120 keVee threshold; however
   the EJ-309 liquid scintillator PSD is superior to the EJ-299-33 plastic
   scintillator PSD, with a figure of merit of 1.5 at the same measurement
   threshold. We also found that the EJ-299-33 has reduced neutron
   detection efficiency compared to the EJ-309. For the fission neutron
   spectrum measured here, the ratio of the plastic to liquid total number
   of measured neutrons was approximately 0.63. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Field trial results of a 5 W all-fiber broadband supercontinuum (SC)
   laser covering the short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength bands from
   similar to 1.55 to 2.35 mu m are presented. The SC laser is kept on a 12
   story tower at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base and propagated
   through the atmosphere to a target 1.6 km away. Beam quality of the SC
   laser after propagating through 1.6 km is studied using a SWIR camera
   and show a near diffraction limited beam with an M-2 value of <1.3. The
   SC laser is used as the illumination source to perform spectral
   reflectance measurements of various samples at 1.6 km, and the results
   are seen to be in good agreement with in-lab measurements using a
   conventional lamp source. Spectral stability measurements are performed
   after atmospheric propagation through 1.6 km and show a relative
   variability of similar to 4\%-8\% across the spectrum depending on the
   atmospheric turbulence effects. Spectral stability measurements are also
   performed in-lab and show a relative variability of <0.6\% across the
   spectrum. (c) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Kite Aerial Photography for Low-Cost, Ultra-high Spatial Resolution
   Multi-Spectral Mapping of Intertidal Landscapes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{Intertidal ecosystems have primarily been studied using field-based
   sampling; remote sensing offers the ability to collect data over large
   areas in a snapshot of time that could complement field-based sampling
   methods by extrapolating them into the wider spatial and temporal
   context. Conventional remote sensing tools (such as satellite and
   aircraft imaging) provide data at limited spatial and temporal
   resolutions and relatively high costs for small-scale environmental
   science and ecologically-focussed studies. In this paper, we describe a
   low-cost, kite-based imaging system and photogrammetric/mapping
   procedure that was developed for constructing high-resolution,
   three-dimensional, multi-spectral terrain models of intertidal rocky
   shores. The processing procedure uses automatic image feature detection
   and matching, structure-from-motion and photo-textured terrain surface
   reconstruction algorithms that require minimal human input and only a
   small number of ground control points and allow the use of cheap,
   consumer-grade digital cameras. The resulting maps combine imagery at
   visible and near-infrared wavelengths and topographic information at
   sub-centimeter resolutions over an intertidal shoreline 200 m long, thus
   enabling spatial properties of the intertidal environment to be
   determined across a hierarchy of spatial scales. Results of the system
   are presented for an intertidal rocky shore at Jervis Bay, New South
   Wales, Australia. Potential uses of this technique include mapping of
   plant (micro-and macro-algae) and animal (e.g. gastropods) assemblages
   at multiple spatial and temporal scales.}},

Title = {{Sb2Se3 under pressure}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Selected members of the A(2)B(3) (A = Sb, Bi; B = Se, Te) family are
   topological insulators. The Sb2Se3 compound does not exhibit any
   topological properties at ambient conditions; a recent high-pressure
   study, however, indicated that pressure transforms Sb2Se3 from a band
   insulator into a topological insulator above similar to 2 GPa; in
   addition, three structural transitions were proposed to occur up to 25
   GPa. Partly motivated by these results, we have performed x-ray
   diffraction and Raman spectroscopy investigations on Sb2Se3 under
   pressure up to 65 GPa. We have identified only one reversible structural
   transition: the initial Pnma structure transforms into a disordered
   cubic bcc alloy above 51 GPa. On the other hand, our high-pressure Raman
   study did not reproduce the previous results; we attribute the
   discrepancies to the effects of the different pressure transmitting
   media used in the high-pressure experiments. We discuss the structural
   behavior of Sb2Se3 within the A(2)B(3) (A = Sb, Bi; B = Se, Te) series.}},

Title = {{A Host-Based RT-PCR Gene Expression Signature to Identify Acute

Journal = {{SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{203}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Improved ways to diagnose acute respiratory viral infections could
   decrease inappropriate antibacterial use and serve as a vital triage
   mechanism in the event of a potential viral pandemic. Measurement of the
   host response to infection is an alternative to pathogen-based
   diagnostic testing and may improve diagnostic accuracy. We have
   developed a host-based assay with a reverse transcription polymerase
   chain reaction (RT-PCR) TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) platform for
   classifying respiratory viral infection. We developed the assay using
   two cohorts experimentally infected with influenza A H3N2/Wisconsin or
   influenza A H1N1/Brisbane, and validated the assay in a sample of adults
   presenting to the emergency department with fever (n = 102) and in
   healthy volunteers (n = 41). Peripheral blood RNA samples were obtained
   from individuals who underwent experimental viral challenge or who
   presented to the emergency department and had microbiologically proven
   viral respiratory infection or systemic bacterial infection. The
   selected gene set on the RT-PCR TLDA assay classified participants with
   experimentally induced influenza H3N2 and H1N1 infection with 100 and
   87\% accuracy, respectively. We validated this host gene expression
   signature in a cohort of 102 individuals arriving at the emergency
   department. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR test was 89\% {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI), 72 to 98\%], and the specificity was 94\%
   (95\% CI, 86 to 99\%). These results show that RT-PCR-based detection of
   a host gene expression signature can classify individuals with
   respiratory viral infection and sets the stage for prospective
   evaluation of this diagnostic approach in a clinical setting.}},

Abstract = {{A gradient sequence copolymer containing 3-hexylthiophene (3HT) and
   3-(6-bromohexyl)thiophene (3BrHT) with a linear change in comonomer
   composition was synthesized via a controlled, chain-growth semi-batch
   method. For comparison, random and block copolymers with the same
   molecular weight and comonomer ratio (1: 1) were prepared. All three
   copolymers exhibited similar molecular weight (M-n similar to 32 kDa),
   low dispersity (D < 1.2) and high regioregularity (>99\%), suggesting
   that any differences among the three copolymers can be attributed to the
   different copolymer sequences. The optical and thermal properties, as
   well as the thin film morphologies, of the gradient copolymer were
   compared to the random and block copolymers and the physical blend of
   the homopolymers. The physical blends showed extensive micron-scale
   phase separation by AFM and TEM. Adding the gradient copolymer to the
   blend resulted in a dramatic reduction in the domain size. Moreover, the
   domain size decreased as the amount of the gradient copolymer increased,
   suggesting that the copolymer is compatibilizing the polymer blend. By
   comparison, the random and block copolymers were less effective
   compatibilizing agents, which indicates that the gradient sequence
   copolymer is well suited to tailor the morphology of immiscible polymer
   blends.}},

Abstract = {{In any data assimilation framework, the background error covariance
   statistics play the critical role of filtering the observed information
   and determining the quality of the analysis. For atmospheric CO2 data
   assimilation, however, the background errors cannot be prescribed via
   traditional forecast or ensemble-based techniques as these fail to
   account for the uncertainties in the carbon emissions and uptake, or for
   the errors associated with the CO2 transport model. We propose an
   approach where the differences between two modeled CO2 concentration
   fields, based on different but plausible CO2 flux distributions and
   atmospheric transport models, are used as a proxy for the statistics of
   the background errors. The resulting error statistics: (1) vary
   regionally and seasonally to better capture the uncertainty in the
   background CO2 field, and (2) have a positive impact on the analysis
   estimates by allowing observations to adjust predictions over large
   areas. A state-of-the-art four-dimensional variational (4D-VAR) system
   developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
   (ECMWF) is used to illustrate the impact of the proposed approach for
   characterizing background error statistics on atmospheric CO2
   concentration estimates. Observations from the Greenhouse gases
   Observing SATellite IBUKI (GOSAT) are assimilated into the ECMWF 4D-VAR
   system along with meteorological variables, using both the new error
   statistics and those based on a traditional forecast-based technique.
   Evaluation of the four-dimensional CO2 fields against independent CO2
   observations confirms that the performance of the data assimilation
   system improves substantially in the summer, when significant
   variability and uncertainty in the fluxes are present.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a partially solution-processed small molecule tandem organic
   photovoltaic cell using an organic/inorganic interlayer structure that
   provides efficient charge recombination while protecting underlying
   layers from degradation due to attack from solvents applied during the
   deposition of subsequent sub-cells. Each sub-cell consists of a
   functionalized squaraine (fSQ) blend donor that is cast from solution,
   followed by evaporation of other functional layers. The first fSQ layer
   is cast from chloroform, while the second is cast from a
   tetrahydrofuran, thereby minimizing dissolution of the relatively
   insoluble, underlying fullerene layer that acts to protect the first
   donor layer. Solvent vapor annealing increases the sub-cell performance
   while decreasing the damage caused by spin-coating of the second fSQ
   layer, both of which result from increased film crystallinity that
   reduces the rate of solvent penetration. The tandem cell has a power
   conversion efficiency of 6.2\% +/- 60.3\% and an open circuit voltage
   nearly equal to the sum of the constituent sub-cells. (C) 2013 AIP

Journal = {{OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{305}},
Pages = {{8-12}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Effective media theory (EMT) is usually used in the simulations and
   descriptions of one type of metamaterials which are composed of
   metal-dielectric multilayer films because of its simplicity and
   intuitiveness. It is consistent with the rigorous electromagnetic field
   analysis when the approximation conditions are strictly satisfied.
   However, there are several noticeable, and sometimes significant
   failures for the predicted properties that are caused by the
   approximation dealing with the finite layer of metal/dielectric
   multilayer structures. These inaccuracies and errors including surface
   plasmon polaritons (SPPs) spreading angles, reflection properties and
   interference patterns for SPPs lithography, originate from the
   differences of isofrequency contours between ideal hyperbolic multilayer
   structures and the actually fabricated multilayer structures with finite
   layer of films. Simulation results of EMT with metal/dielectric
   multilayer structures are analyzed and compared with the rigorous field
   analysis approach. Being aware of these issues can help to reduce the
   errors and improve the designs of the plasmonic devices for many
   applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{4978-4985}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Despite the widespread use of monochloramine in drinking water
   treatment, there is surprisingly little information about its mode of
   action. In this study, DNA microarrays were used to investigate the
   global gene expression of Escherichia coli cells exposed to sublethal
   concentrations of monochloramine, with a focus on temporal dynamics.
   Genes induced by monochloramine were associated with several stress
   response functions, including oxidative stress, DNA repair, multidrug
   efflux, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and cell wall repair.
   The diversity of functional associations supports a model of
   monochloramine action involving multiple cellular targets including cell
   membranes, nucleic acids, and proteins. These data suggest that E. coli
   responds to monochloramine exposure by activating diverse defense
   responses rather than a single antioxidant system and the exposure may
   also induce biofilm formation. The induction of multidrug efflux pumps
   and specific antibiotic resistance genes further suggests that exposure
   to monochloramine may contribute to reduced susceptibility to some
   antibiotics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{61-71}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper a metric for assessing the producibility of a stiffened
   grillage structure in the early stage design is presented. This metric
   is comprised of seven separate producibility drivers that are dependent
   on the properties of the panel. The new producibility metric is compared
   with a traditional costing method in a two-objective genetic algorithm
   to show that there is a competition between the two methods, meaning
   that the new metric gives a designer additional information at the early
   design stage. The estimated costs versus producibility scores for
   several grillage sizes show that large gains in producibility can be
   made without large increases in estimated costs up until a critical
   point where a knee in the Pareto front occurs. Furthermore, it was found
   that the individual producibility elements are highly dependent on the
   size of the panel tested and the constraints the panel must meet. In
   general, producibility is a key factor to be considered in structural
   design and should be accounted for in any structural optimization. (C)

Abstract = {{The problem of a two-dimensional planing flat plate is studied using a
   nonlinear CFD solver for varying Froude number and angle of attack. This
   work extends several classical works, which typically use potential-flow
   assumptions and either assume linear free-surface and body boundary
   conditions or ignore gravitational effects. In the current study, the
   effects of viscosity and free-surface nonlinearity are studied via
   quasi-steady CFD calculations. The objective is to determine the regimes
   in which the linearized potential-flow assumptions become invalid and
   nonlinear methods must be used. The results show that nonlinear and
   viscous effects are important when the angle of attack is greater than
   approximately 10 degrees and when the Froude number based on the initial
   immersed length is lower than 0.8. In addition, the unsteadiness limit
   due to wave breaking is found to occur for a nearly constant
   immersion-based Froude number of approximately 2.75. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Post-reconstruction non-local means filtering methods using CT side
   information for quantitative SPECT}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{6225-6240}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Quantitative SPECT techniques are important for many applications
   including internal emitter therapy dosimetry where accurate estimation
   of total target activity and activity distribution within targets are
   both potentially important for dose-response evaluations. We
   investigated non-local means (NLM) post-reconstruction filtering for
   accurate I-131 SPECT estimation of both total target activity and the 3D
   activity distribution. We first investigated activity estimation versus
   number of ordered-subsets expectation-maximization (OSEM) iterations. We
   performed simulations using the XCAT phantom with tumors containing a
   uniform and a non-uniform activity distribution, and measured the
   recovery coefficient (RC) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) to
   quantify total target activity and activity distribution, respectively.
   We observed that using more OSEM iterations is essential for accurate
   estimation of RC, but may or may not improve RMSE. We then investigated
   various post-reconstruction filtering methods to suppress noise at high
   iteration while preserving image details so that both RC and RMSE can be
   improved. Recently, NLM filtering methods have shown promising results
   for noise reduction. Moreover, NLM methods using high-quality side
   information can improve image quality further. We investigated several
   NLM methods with and without CT side information for I-131 SPECT imaging
   and compared them to conventional Gaussian filtering and to unfiltered
   methods. We studied four different ways of incorporating CT information
   in the NLM methods: two known (NLM CT-B and NLM CT-M) and two newly
   considered (NLM CT-S and NLM CT-H). We also evaluated the robustness of
   NLM filtering using CT information to erroneous CT. NLM CT-S and NLM
   CT-H yielded comparable RC values to unfiltered images while
   substantially reducing RMSE. NLMCT-S achieved -2.7 to 2.6\% increase of
   RC compared to no filtering and NLM CT-H yielded up to 6\% decrease in
   RC while other methods yielded lower RCs than them: Gaussian filtering
   (up to 11.8\% decrease in RC), NLM method without CT (up to 9.5\%
   decrease in RC), and NLM CT-M and NLM CT-B (up to 19.4\% decrease in
   RC). NLM CT-S and NLM CT-H achieved 8.2 to 33.9\% and -0.9 to 36\%
   decreased RMSE on tumors compared to no filtering respectively while
   other methods yielded less reduced or increased RMSE: Gaussian filtering
   (up to 7.9\% increase in RMSE), NLM method without CT (up to 18.3\%
   increase in RMSE), and NLM CT-M and NLM CT-B (up to 31.5\% increase in
   RMSE). NLM CT-S and NLM CT-H also yielded images with tumor shapes that
   better-matched the true shapes than other methods. All NLM methods using
   CT information were robust to small misregistration between SPECT and
   CT, but NLM CT-S and NLM CT-H were more sensitive than NLM CT-M and NLM
   CT-B to missing CT information.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study is presented of the effect of key processing
   parameters on the seed-and-grow synthesis of PS@Au nanoshells with
   chitosan as a surface modifier. The parameters of (1) different seeds,
   (2) pH of buffer solution, (3) reducing agents and (4) K-gold
   concentration were studied. The first two are related to the seeding
   phase whereas the latter two to the growth phase. Carboxylate-terminated
   polystyrene (PS) spheres were synthesized and then modified by chitosan.
   Gold seeds of 1-20 nm were prepared and anchored at the PS surface via
   the N-Au bonding for growth of a complete gold shell. Studies show that
   THPC-gold nanoparticles are favored for seed coverage, and the pH value
   of the solution is important for surface functionalization. While the
   reducing agents studied all produce complete Au nanoshells under their
   respective optimal conditions, the shell quality differs with different
   reducing agents. For robust synthesis of PS@gold nanoshells, the
   following conditions are recommended: the THPC-gold particles as seeds,
   pH of 2.5-3.0, formaldehyde as the reducing agent and a K-gold
   concentration of 2.5 x 10(-4) M. By fine-tuning these parameters, the
   nanoshells of desired thickness and smoothness can be made. These
   findings are supported by the TEM images of seed and shell morphologies
   and by the measured UV-vis spectra of light absorption. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Robust estimates of hypoxic extent (both area and volume) are important
   for assessing the impacts of low dissolved oxygen on aquatic ecosystems
   at large spatial scales. Such estimates are also important for
   calibrating models linking hypoxia to causal factors, such as nutrient
   loading and stratification, and for informing management decisions. In
   this study, we develop a rigorous geostatistical modeling framework to
   estimate the hypoxic extent in the northern Gulf of Mexico from data
   collected during midsummer, quasi-synoptic monitoring cruises
   (1985-2011). Instead of a traditional interpolation-based approach, we
   use a simulation-based approach that yields more robust extent estimates
   and quantified uncertainty. The modeling framework also makes use of
   covariate information (i.e., trend variables such as depth and spatial
   position), to reduce estimation uncertainty. Furthermore, adjustments
   are made to account for observational bias resulting from the use of
   different sampling instruments in different years. Our results suggest
   an increasing trend in hypoxic layer thickness (p = 0.05) from 1985 to
   2011, but less than significant increases in volume (p = 0.12) and area
   (p = 0.42). The uncertainties in the extent estimates vary with sampling
   network coverage and instrument type, and generally decrease over the
   study period.}},

Abstract = {{Motion capture is usually performed on only a few steps of over-ground
   locomotion, limited by the finite sensing volume of most capture
   systems. This makes it difficult to evaluate walking over longer
   distances, or in a natural environment outside the laboratory. Here we
   show that motion capture may be performed relative to a mobile platform,
   such as a wheeled cart that is moved with the walking subject. To
   determine the person's absolute displacement in space, the cart's own
   motion must be localized. We present three localization methods and
   evaluate their performance. The first detects cart motion solely from
   the relative motion of the subject's feet during walking. The others use
   sensed motion of the cart's wheels to perform odometry, with and without
   an additional gyroscope to enhance sensitivity to turning about the
   vertical axis. We show that such methods are practical to implement, and
   with present-day sensors can yield accuracy of better than 1\% over
   arbitrary distances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Synergistic microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature and exhibit
   appealing features, such as sophisticated metabolic capabilities and
   robustness. This has inspired fast-growing interest in engineering
   synthetic microbial consortia for biotechnology development. However,
   there are relatively few reports of their use in real-world
   applications, and achieving population stability and regulation has
   proven to be challenging. In this work, we bridge ecology theory with
   engineering principles to develop robust synthetic fungal-bacterial
   consortia for efficient biosynthesis of valuable products from
   lignocellulosic feedstocks. The required biological functions are
   divided between two specialists: the fungus Trichoderma reesei, which
   secretes cellulase enzymes to hydrolyze lignocellulosic biomass into
   soluble saccharides, and the bacterium Escherichia coli, which
   metabolizes soluble saccharides into desired products. We developed and
   experimentally validated a comprehensive mathematical model for T.
   reesei/E. coli consortia, providing insights on key determinants of the
   system's performance. To illustrate the bioprocessing potential of this
   consortium, we demonstrate direct conversion of microcrystalline
   cellulose and pretreated corn stover to isobutanol. Without costly
   nutrient supplementation, we achieved titers up to 1.88 g/L and yields
   up to 62\% of theoretical maximum. In addition, we show that
   cooperator-cheater dynamics within T. reesei/E. coli consortia lead to
   stable population equilibria and provide a mechanism for tuning
   composition. Although we offer isobutanol production as a
   proof-of-concept application, our modular system could be readily
   adapted for production of many other valuable biochemicals.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1586-1594}},

Abstract = {{A new design method is presented for proportional-integral (PI)
   controllers of first-order plants in the presence of time delays. In
   general, time delays can limit and degrade the achievable performance of
   the controlled system, and even induce instability. Thus, the PI gains
   should be selected carefully considering such effects of time delays.
   Unlike existing methods, the design method presented in this paper is
   based on solutions to delay differential equations, which are derived in
   terms of the Lambert W function. PI controllers for first-order plants
   with time delays are designed by obtaining the rightmost (i.e.,
   dominant) eigenvalues in the infinite eigenspectrum of time-delay
   systems and assigning them to desired positions in the complex plane.
   The process is possible due to a novel property of the Lambert W
   function. The controllers designed using the presented method can
   improve the system performance and successfully stabilize an unstable
   plant. Also, sensitivity analysis of the rightmost eigenvalues is
   conducted, and the results compare favorably with those of a
   prediction-based method for eigenvalue assignment. Extension to design
   of PI-differential controllers is discussed with examples.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal shape of flying wings for subsonic and transonic speeds is
   examined using a suite of tools developed around a three-dimensional,
   time-spectral, Euler computational fluid dynamics solver. The first
   result in the study is a lift-constrained drag minimization, performed
   on an unswept, rectangular wing. When the spanwise twist distribution of
   the wing is varied, the elliptic optimum predicted by the low-speed
   inviscid theory can be reproduced. With this result as a reference,
   three different optimization formulations are explored. These
   formulations consider the addition of bending moment constraints,
   static-stability constraints, and dynamic-stability constraints. In each
   case, the design space of the problem is explored using both planform
   and shape variables to determine the optimal shape. These techniques are
   used to show that the addition of stability constraints has a
   significant impact on the optimal surface shape of the wing. In
   particular, it is shown that at lower speeds, the airfoil shape is
   sufficient to satisfy static-stability constraints, whereas
   dynamic-stability constraints require the addition of sweep. It is also
   shown that at higher speeds, the airfoil shape is insufficient to
   satisfy the stability constraint, either static or dynamic, and that the
   addition of sweep is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) slope stability analyses are not performed
   routinely because they involve increased effort compared with
   two-dimensional analyses, and because the latter yield more conservative
   results. However, in cases of distinct limitations of the width of the
   failure region (e.g., in the case of excavations), an assessment of
   safety using 3D stability analyses may be more appropriate. The
   kinematic approach of limit analysis for the assessment of stability of
   slopes is presented, based on a recently conceived rigid-rotation 3D
   mechanism modified to include below-toe failures, which are common for
   gentle slopes. The presence of pore-water pressure in the slope is
   included approximately using the scalar parameter r(u). The results are
   presented in terms of the critical height (or dimensionless coefficient
   gamma H/c), and also in the form of charts and a closed-form
   approximation formula that allow for direct assessment of the safety
   factor for slopes with constrained width. Not surprisingly, the safety
   factor decreases with an increase in the pore-water pressure and with an
   increased width of the slope (increased failure zone). (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{Apicomplexan parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii rely on actin-based
   motility to cross biological barriers and invade host cells. Key
   structural and biochemical differences in host and parasite actins make
   this an attractive target for small-molecule inhibitors. Here we took
   advantage of recent advances in the synthesis of cyclic depsipeptide
   compounds that stabilize filamentous actin to test the ability of
   chondramides to disrupt growth of T. gondii in vitro. Structural
   modeling of chondramide A (2) binding to an actin filament model
   revealed variations in the binding site between host and parasite
   actins. A series of 10 previously synthesized analogues (2b-k) with
   substitutions in the beta-tyrosine moiety blocked parasite growth on
   host cell monolayers with EC50 values that ranged from 0.3 to 1.3 mu M.
   In vitro polymerization assays using highly purified recombinant actin
   from T. gondii verified that synthetic and natural product chondramides
   target the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with this, chondramide
   treatment blocked parasite invasion into host cells and was more rapidly
   effective than pyrimethamine, a standard therapeutic agent. Although the
   current compounds lack specificity for parasite vs host actin, these
   studies provide a platform for the future design and synthesis of
   synthetic cyclic peptide inhibitors that selectively disrupt actin
   dynamics in parasites.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of poly(amido amine) (or PAMAM) dendrimers to condense
   semiflexible dsDNA and penetrate cell membranes gives them great
   potential in gene therapy and drug delivery but their high positive
   surface charge makes them cytotoxic. Here, we describe the effects of
   partial neutralization by acetylation on DNA condensation using light
   scattering, circular dichroism, and single molecule imaging of
   dendrimer-DNA complexes combed onto surfaces and tethered to those
   surfaces under flow. We find that DNA can be condensed by
   generation-five (G5) dendrimers even when the surface charges are more
   than 65\% neutralized, but that such dendrimers bind negligibly when an
   end-tethered DNA is stretched in flow. We also find that when fully
   charged dendrimers are introduced by flow to end-tethered DNA, all DNA
   molecules become equally highly coated with dendrimers at a rate that
   becomes very fast at high dendrimer concentration, and that dendrimers
   remain bound during subsequent flow of dendrimer-free buffer. These
   results suggest that the presence of dendrimer-free DNA coexisting with
   dendrimer-bound DNA after bulk mixing of the two in solution may result
   from diffusion-limited irreversible dendrimer-DNA binding, rather than,
   or in addition to, the previously proposed cooperative binding mechanism
   of dendrimers to DNA.}},

Abstract = {{Current neural prosthetic devices (NPDs) induce chronic inflammation due
   to complex mechanical and biological reactions related, in part, to
   staggering discrepancies of mechanical properties with neural tissue.
   Relatively large size of the implants and traumas to blood-brain barrier
   contribute to inflammation reactions, as well. Mitigation of these
   problems and the realization of long-term brain interface require a new
   generation of NPDs fabricated from flexible materials compliant with the
   brain tissue. However, such materials will need to display
   hard-to-combine mechanical and electrical properties which are not
   available in the toolbox of classical neurotechnology. Moreover, these
   new materials will concomitantly demand different methods of (a) device
   micromanufacturing and (b) surgical implantation in brains because
   currently used processes take advantage of high stiffness of the
   devices. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) serve as a promising foundation for
   such materials because of their record mechanical and electrical
   properties, but CNT-based tissue-compliant devices have not been
   realized yet. In this study, we formalize the mechanical requirements to
   tissue-compliant implants based on critical rupture strength of brain
   tissue and demonstrate that miniature (NT-based devices can satisfy
   these requirements. We fabricated them using MEMS-like technology and
   miniaturized them so that at least two dimensions of the electrodes
   would be comparable to brain tissue cells. The nanocomposite-based
   flexible neural electrodes were implanted into the rat motor cortex
   using a surgical procedure specifically designed for soft
   tissue-compliant implants. The post-surgery implant localization in the
   motor cortex was successfully visualized with magnetic resonance and
   photoacoustic Imaging. In vivo functionality was demonstrated by
   successful registration of the low-frequency neural recording in the
   live brain of anesthetized rats. Investigation of inflammation processes
   around these electrodes will be required to establish their prospects as
   long-term neural electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{The article introduces a novel approach to color image processing that
   utilizes multi-peak resonant tunneling diodes for encoding color
   information in quantized states of the diodes. The Multi-Peak Resonant
   Tunneling Diodes (MPRTDs) are organized as a two-dimensional array of
   vertical pillars which are locally connected by programmable passive and
   active elements with a view to realizing a wide variety of color image
   processing functions such as quantization, color extraction, image
   smoothing, edge detection, and line detection. In order to process color
   information in the input images, two different methods for color
   representation schemes have been used: one using color mapping and the
   other using direct RGB representation. Finally, the article uses HSPICE
   simulation methods for the nestlist of the proposed RTD-based
   nanoarchitecture in order to verify a candidate of image functions by
   using the afore-mentioned representation methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes how we applied simulation and optimization in
   combination to improve patient flow within the Duke Cancer Institute, a
   large cancer center. We first developed a discrete-event simulation
   model to predict patient waiting time and resource utilization
   throughout various parts of the center, including the outpatient clinic,
   radiology, the pharmacy, laboratory services, and the oncology treatment
   facility. Simulation model studies showed that nurse unavailability
   during oncology treatment causes a serious bottleneck in patient flow.
   Next, we developed a mixed-integer programming model to relieve the
   bottleneck by optimizing weekly and monthly scheduling of different
   types of nurses. Finally, we developed a novel simulation-optimization
   model to further relieve the bottleneck by optimizing the starting times
   of nurse shifts. Our paper summarizes our main findings and the
   resulting recommendations that Duke Cancer Institute implemented.}},

Abstract = {{A thermodynamics- based computationally efficient mean value engine
   model that computes ignition delay, combustion phases, exhaust

   for the use of control strategy development. The model is derived from
   the thermodynamic principles of ideal gas standard limited pressure
   cycle. In order to improve the fidelity of the model, assumptions that
   are typically used to idealize the cycle are modified or replaced with
   ones that more realistically replicate the physical process such as
   exhaust valve timing, in-cylinder heat transfer, and the combustion
   characteristics that change under varying engine operating conditions.
   The model is calibrated and validated with the test data from a Ford 6.7
   liter diesel engine. The mean value model developed in this study is a
   flexible simulation tool that provides excellent computational
   efficiency without sacrificing critical details of the underlying

Abstract = {{The soot/nitric oxides (NOx) trade-off of diesel, biodiesel, and

   low temperature combustion (LTC) mode is investigated in this study.
   Compared to diesel, biodiesel demonstrates poorer spray behavior and
   shorter ignition delay, but its oxygen content results in less soot.
   Blending ethanol into biodiesel enhances spray behavior, prolongs
   ignition delay, and further increases fuel oxygen fraction, resulting in
   a larger reduction in soot. In the moderate EGR premixed low temperature
   combustion mode, an obvious soot/NOx trade-off is demonstrated with
   diesel fuel. The soot/NOx trade-off is improved by biodiesel fuel and
   defeated by the biodiesel-ethanol blend. Low soot, low NOx, and high
   combustion efficiency are achieved with the biodiesel-ethanol blend and
   proper EGR rate.}},

Abstract = {{The blood vessel wall plays a prominent role in the development of many
   life threatening diseases and as such is an attractive target for
   treatment. To target diseased tissue, particulate drug carriers often
   have their surfaces modified with antibodies or epitopes specific to
   vascular wall expressed molecules, along with poly(ethylene glycol)
   (PEG) to improve carrier blood circulation time However, little is known
   about the effect of poly(ethylene glycol) on carrier adhesion
   dynamics-specifically in blood flow. Here we examine the influence of
   different molecular weight PEG spacers on particle adhesion in blood
   flow. Anti-ICAM-1 or Sialyl Lewis(a) were grafted onto polystyrene 2 mu
   m and 500 nm spheres via PEG spacers and perfused in blood over
   activated endothelial cells at physiological shear conditions. PEG
   spacers were shown to improve, reduce, or have no effect on the binding
   density of targeted-carriers depending on the PEG surface conformation,
   shear rate, and targeting moiety.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional genetic analysis relies on mutants with observable
   phenotypes. Mutants lacking visible abnormalities may nevertheless
   exhibit molecular differences useful for defining gene function. To
   examine this, we analyzed tissue-specific transcript profiles from
   Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor gene mutants with known roles
   in root epidermis development, but lacking a single-gene mutant
   phenotype due to genetic redundancy. We discovered substantial
   transcriptional changes in each mutant, preferentially affecting root
   epidermal genes in a manner consistent with the known double mutant
   effects. Furthermore, comparing transcript profiles of single and double
   mutants, we observed remarkable variation in the sensitivity of target
   genes to the loss of one or both paralogous genes, including
   preferential effects on specific branches of the epidermal gene network,
   likely reflecting the pathways of paralog subfunctionalization during
   evolution. In addition, we analyzed the root epidermal transcriptome of
   the transparent testa glabra2 mutant to clarify its role in the network.
   These findings provide insight into the molecular basis of genetic
   redundancy and duplicate gene diversification at the level of a specific
   gene regulatory network, and they demonstrate the usefulness of
   tissue-specific transcript profiling to define gene function in mutants
   lacking informative visible changes in phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{We present a microfluidic biochip for trapping single white blood cells
   (WBCs). The novel biochip, microfabricated using standard surface
   micromachining processes, consists of an array of precisely engineered
   microholes that confine single cells in a tight, three dimensional space
   and mechanically immobilize them. A high (>87\%) trapping efficiency was
   achieved when WBC-containing samples were delivered to the biochip at
   the optimal pressure of 3 psi. The biochip can efficiently trap up to
   7500 cells, maintaining a high trapping efficiency even when the number
   of cells is extremely low (similar to 200 cells). We believe that the
   developed biochip can be used as a standalone unit in a biology/clinical
   lab for trapping WBCs as well as other cell types and imaging them using
   a standard fluorescent microscope at the single cell level. Furthermore,
   it can be integrated with other miniaturized optical modules to
   construct a portable platform for counting a wide variety of cells and
   therefore it can be an excellent tool for monitoring human diseases at
   the point-of-care. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A novel two-dimensional, physically based model of soil erosion and
   sediment transport coupled to models of hydrological and overland flow
   processes has been developed. The Hairsine-Rose formulation of erosion
   and deposition processes is used to account for size-selective sediment
   transport and differentiate bed material into original and deposited
   soil layers. The formulation is integrated within the framework of the
   hydrologic and hydrodynamic model tRIBS-OFM, Triangulated irregular
   network-based, Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator-Overland Flow Model.
   The integrated model explicitly couples the hydrodynamic formulation
   with the advection-dominated transport equations for sediment of
   multiple particle sizes. To solve the system of equations including both
   the Saint-Venant and the Hairsine-Rose equations, the finite volume
   method is employed based on Roe's approximate Riemann solver on an
   unstructured grid. The formulation yields space-time dynamics of flow,
   erosion, and sediment transport at fine scale. The integrated model has
   been successfully verified with analytical solutions and empirical data
   for two benchmark cases. Sensitivity tests to grid resolution and the
   number of used particle sizes have been carried out. The model has been
   validated at the catchment scale for the Lucky Hills watershed located
   in southeastern Arizona, USA, using 10 events for which catchment-scale
   streamflow and sediment yield data were available. Since the model is
   based on physical laws and explicitly uses multiple types of watershed
   information, satisfactory results were obtained. The spatial output has
   been analyzed and the driving role of topography in erosion processes
   has been discussed. It is expected that the integrated formulation of
   the model has the promise to reduce uncertainties associated with
   typical parameterizations of flow and erosion processes. A potential for
   more credible modeling of earth-surface processes is thus anticipated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of controlling rotating machinery with
   actuators and sensors fixed in inertial space. Such a problem arises in
   control of charging and fusing stages in the xerographic process,
   drilling and milling machines, and turbo machinery. If a rotating device
   is represented as a set of discrete wedges, the resulting system can be
   conceptualized as a set of plants (wedges) with a single actuator and
   sensor. In such architecture, each plant can be controlled only
   intermittently, in a stroboscopic manner. This leads to the problem of
   cyclic control (CC) considered in this paper. Specifically, the problem
   of stabilizability in CC architecture is considered, and the resulting
   stabilizability conditions are compared with those in the usual,
   permanently acting control (PAC). In this regard, it is shown that the
   domain of asymptotic stability under CC is an open disc in the open left
   half plane (OLHP), rather than the OLHP itself, and the controller gains
   that place the closed loop poles at the desired locations under CC are N
   times larger than those under PAC, where N is the number of wedges. The
   results are applied to temperature stabilization of the fusing stage of
   a xerographic process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a novel method for designing step tracking
   controllers for systems with saturating actuators. The approach is based
   on the theory of Quasi-linear Control (QLC), which offers methods for
   designing random reference tracking controllers for systems with
   nonlinear actuators and sensors. In the current paper, a QLC approach to
   designing step tracking controllers is presented. The development is
   based on two ideas: introducing a precompensator, which observes given
   step tracking specifications, and recasting the output of the
   precompensator into a random reference bandwidth requirement, with
   subsequent utilization of QLC. Unlike other techniques, the method
   developed here takes the saturation into account directly at the initial
   stage of the design and does not require subsequent augmentations (e.
   g., anti-windup). Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, a
   comparison with the anti-windup approach is provided.}},

Abstract = {{We characterize the three dimensional structure and quantify turbulence

   Dye flow-visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) velocity

   Two-component velocity measurements are made on three sets of orthogonal
   planes for Re-j = 1000, 1800, 2600, and 3700; the overall structure of
   the flow field is found to be qualitatively similar for the Reynolds
   numbers studied, but the precise trajectory of the mean flow is found to
   be sensitive to inflow boundary conditions. Reynolds stresses and
   anisotropic invariants are calculated; the turbulent kinetic energy
   decreases linearly with increasing distance downstream in the reactor
   and it decreases at the same relative rate for all Reynolds numbers
   studied; anisotropic invariants and Reynolds stress maps indicate a
   turbulent stress state that tends toward isotropy downstream of the
   inlets. Turbulent stress maps indicate that the Reynolds stress
   components are stratified in the reactor channel, becoming uniform as a
   function of z by y/D-h = 4.}},

Journal = {{GAIT \& POSTURE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A sudden underfoot perturbation can present a serious threat to balance
   during gait, but little is known about how humans recover from such
   perturbations or whether their response is affected by age. We tested
   the hypothesis that age would not affect the stepping responses to a
   nominal 10 degree inversion or eversion of the stance foot during gait.
   Twenty-three healthy young (22.7 +/- 3.35 yrs) and 18 healthy old adults
   (68.0 +/- 7.19 yrs) performed 60 walking trials along a 6-m level
   walkway at a normal gait speed. In 16 of these trials, a single medial
   (MP) or lateral (LP) perturbation was randomly administered once under
   the left or right foot. Recovery step width (SW), step length (SL),
   trunk kinematics and walking speed were measured optoelectronically.
   Repeated-measures analysis of variance and post hoc t-tests were used to
   test the hypotheses. The results show that a MP or LP altered the
   recovery SL (p = 0.005) and age affected the number of recovery steps (p
   = 0.017), as well as the first recovery SW and SL (p = 0.013 and p =
   0.031, respectively). Both MP and LP caused young adults to have wider
   SW (p < 0.02) and shorter SL (p < 0.005) without changing trunk movement
   during their first recovery step. Older adults, however, significantly
   changed lateral trunk inclination during the first recovery step,
   decreased their fourth recovery SL (p < 0.001). We conclude that young
   adults adjust the step kinematics of as many as four recovery steps
   following this perturbation, a response that was delayed and
   significantly weaker in older adults who instead exhibited an immediate
   torso inclination consistent with a hip response strategy. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Gait parameters such as stride length, width, and period, as well as
   their respective variabilities, are widely used as indicators of
   mobility and walking function. Foot placement and its variability have
   thus been applied in areas such as aging, fall risk, spinal cord injury,
   diabetic neuropathy, and neurological conditions. But a drawback is that
   these measures are presently best obtained with specialized laboratory
   equipment such as motion capture systems and instrumented walkways,
   which may not be available in many clinics and certainly not during
   daily activities. One alternative is to fix inertial measurement units
   (IMUs) to the feet or body to gather motion data. However, few existing
   methods measure foot placement directly, due to drift associated with
   inertial data. We developed a method to measure stride-to-stride foot
   placement in unconstrained environments, and tested whether it can
   accurately quantify gait parameters over long walking distances. The
   method uses ground contact conditions to correct for drift, and state
   estimation algorithms to improve estimation of angular orientation. We
   tested the method with healthy adults walking over-ground, averaging 93
   steps per trial, using a mobile motion capture system to provide
   reference data. We found IMU estimates of mean stride length and
   duration within 1\% of motion capture, and standard deviations of length
   and width within 4\% of motion capture. Step width cannot be directly
   estimated by IMUs, although lateral stride variability can. Inertial
   sensors measure walks over arbitrary distances, yielding estimates with
   good statistical confidence. Gait can thus be measured in a variety of
   environments, and even applied to long-term monitoring of everyday
   walking. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids that integrate renewable power sources are suitable for rural
   communities or certain military applications such as forward operation
   bases. For microgrids that are not connected to the large electric grid,
   new control strategies must be designed to maintain proper grid voltage
   and frequency. In addition, microgrids with distributed power sources
   and load nodes may have frequent reconfiguration in grid architecture.
   Therefore, the control strategies ideally should be ``plug-and-play{''},
   i.e., they should not require significant communication or architecture
   information, and they should work reliably as long as the supply/demand
   powers are reasonably balanced. Another unique issue of microgrids is
   the high resistance loss in distribution lines due to the low operating
   voltage. To reduce power losses, appropriate voltage control at
   distributed nodes is required which again must work in a plug-and-play
   fashion. In this paper, we propose a decentralized voltage control
   algorithm that minimizes power losses for microgrids. Its optimality and
   plug-and-play nature are demonstrated through comprehensive simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing energy security and reliability concerns are intensifying the
   interest in microgrids. In this setting, design optimization is vital to
   achieve a reliable infrastructure without overbuilding. This paper
   considers the impact of frequency and voltage regulation on the optimal
   design of a conceptual, autonomous military microgrid. This microgrid
   comprises a solar panel and vehicles as power sources, with each vehicle
   incorporating a battery and generator. The power output and terminal
   voltage of these inverter-based sources must be regulated. The paper
   investigates the effects of battery DC voltage variations on a
   decentralized regulation scheme, and the resulting influence on optimal
   component sizing. To this end, controllers are first designed based on
   the typical assumption that the voltage on the DC side of each inverter
   is constant. The battery internal resistance is then considered and its
   impact on regulation performance is investigated. The results show that
   the battery internal resistance can affect the performance of both
   frequency and voltage regulation, and consequently must be taken into
   account in component sizing decisions. Thus, the paper identifies an
   important coupling between regulation and component sizing problems
   through battery characteristics, and highlights the need for a combined
   sizing and regulation framework for microgrid design.}},

Abstract = {{Cohesive-zone models of fracture provide a framework that allows a
   smooth transition between a strength-based approach to fracture and an
   energy-based approach. At the heart of these models are traction
   separation laws that are described by a cohesive strength and toughness.
   These cohesive-law parameters can be used to define a cohesive-length
   scale that, when compared to physical length scales in the problem,
   gives an indication of whether failure is controlled by strength or
   energy considerations. Mixed-mode fracture is described by a phase angle
   that provides a measure of the partition of the deformation energy into
   shear and normal components. It is shown that this phase angle can be
   calculated for a cohesive-zone model, and that, if the cohesive length
   is small enough, the phase angle agrees with the value predicted by
   linear-elastic fracture mechanics, irrespective of the shape of the
   cohesive-laws. It is further shown that the cohesive length derived from
   the cohesive parameters can be used to rationalize the concept of a
   phase angle for interfacial fracture in the presence of a modulus
   mismatch. In particular, the length scale required to define a phase
   angle for interfacial fracture can be identified with the cohesive
   length of a cohesive-zone model. This phase angle shifts with changes in
   the cohesive length in accordance to the predictions of linear-elastic
   interfacial fracture mechanics. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Successful high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) thermal tissue
   ablation relies on accurate information of the tissue temperature and
   tissue status. Often temperature measurements are used to predict and
   monitor the ablation process. In this study, we conducted HIFU ablation
   experiments with ex vivo porcine myocardium tissue specimens to identify
   changes in temperature associated with tissue coagulation and
   bubble/cavity formation. Using infrared (IR) thermography and
   synchronized bright-field imaging with HIFU applied near the tissue
   surface, parameters derived from the spatiotemporal evolution of
   temperature were correlated with HIFU-induced lesion formation and
   overheating, of which the latter typically results in cavity generation
   and/or tissue dehydration. Emissivity of porcine myocardium was first
   measured to be 0.857 +/- 0.006 (n = 3). HIFU outcomes were classified
   into non-ablative, normal lesion, and overheated lesion. A marked
   increase in the rate of temperature change during HIFU application was
   observed with lesion formation. A criterion using the maximum normalized
   second time derivative of temperature change provided 99.1\% accuracy
   for lesion identification with a 0.05 s(-1) Asymmetric temperature
   distribution on the tissue surface was observed to correlate with
   overheating and/or bubble generation. A criterion using the maximum
   displacement of the spatial location of the peak temperature provided
   90.9\% accuracy to identify overheated lesion with a 0.16 mm threshold.
   Spatiotemporal evolution of temperature obtained using IR imaging
   allowed determination of the critical cumulative equivalent minutes at
   43 degrees C (CEM43) for lesion formation to be 170 min. Similar
   temperature characteristics indicative of lesion formation and
   overheating were identified for subsurface HIFU ablation. These results
   suggest that parameters derived from temperature changes during HIFU
   application are associated with irreversible changes in tissue and may
   provide useful information for monitoring HIFU treatment. (C) 2013

   The design goal is to maximize the root-mean-square value of output
   voltage generated by external vibration leading structures. To calculate
   the output voltage, the magnetic field analysis is performed by using
   the finite element method, and the obtained magnetic flux linkage is
   interpolated by using Lagrange polynomials. To achieve the design goal,
   permanent magnet is designed by using topology optimization. The
   analytical design sensitivity is derived from the adjoint variable
   method, and the formulated optimization problem is solved through the
   method of moving asymptotes (MMA). As optimization results, the optimal
   location and shape of the permanent magnet are provided when the
   magnetization direction is fixed. In addition, the optimization results
   including the design of magnetization direction are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Smart materials have gained a great deal of attention in recent years
   because of their unique actuation properties. Actuators are needed in
   the medical field where space is limited. Presented within this work is
   an organ positioner used to position the esophagus away from the left
   atrium to avoid the development of an esophageal fistula during atrial
   fibrillation (afib) ablation procedures. Within this work, a subroutine
   was implemented into the finite element framework to predict the midspan
   load capacity of a near equiatomic NiTi specimen in both the super
   elastic and shape memory regimes. The purpose of the simulations and
   experimental results was to develop a design envelope for the organ
   positioning device. The transverse loading experiments were conducted at
   several different temperatures leading to the ability to design a
   variable stiffness actuator. This is essential because the actuator must
   not be too stiff to injure the organ it is positioning. Extended
   further, geometric perturbations were applied in the virtual model and
   the entire design envelope was developed. Further, nitinol was tested
   for safety in the radio-frequency environment (to ensure that local
   heating will not occur in the ablation environment). With the safety of
   the device confirmed, a primitive prototype was manufactured and
   successfully tested in a cadaver. The design of the final device is also
   presented. The contribution of this work is the presentation of a new
   type of positoning device for medical purposes (NiTiBOP). In the process
   a comprehensive model for transverse actuation of an SMA actuator was
   developed and experimentally verified.}},

Abstract = {{The growing popularity of finite element analysis in the 1980s and 1990s
   spawned new techniques for modelling damping in complex structures. The
   Golla-Hughes-McTavish (GUM) method is one technique developed during
   this era. This method adds non-spatial degrees of freedom to a finite
   element model in order to account for a viscoelastic material's ability
   to dissipate energy. In the GHM method, a material modulus function is
   used to characterize the frequency-dependent complex modulus. This paper
   presents a novel material modulus function, thus modifying the GH1V1
   method. The advantages of this Modified Golla-Hughes-McTavish (MGHM)
   approach are a reduction in the curve fitting error and a standardized
   approach for computing material modulus coefficients. An additional
   parameter is introduced for each dissipation degree of freedom. This
   paper will compare the original GHM curve fit approach with this new
   standardized MGHM approach. Advantages of the MGHM approach and physical
   insight into the model are explained.}},

Title = {{Spatially resolved assessment of hepatic function using 99mTc-IDA SPECT}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: 99mTc-iminodiacetic acid (IDA) hepatobiliary imaging is usually
   quantified for hepatic function on the entire liver or regions of
   interest (ROIs) in the liver. The authors presented a method to estimate
   the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) voxel-by-voxel from single-photon
   emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT with a 99mTc-labeled IDA agent
   of mebrofenin and evaluated the spatially resolved HEF measurements with
   an independent physiological measurement.
   Methods: Fourteen patients with intrahepatic cancers were treated with
   radiation therapy (RT) and imaged by 99mTc-mebrofenin SPECT before and 1
   month after RT. The dynamic SPECT volumes were with a resolution of 3.9
   x 3.9 x 2.5 mm(3). Throughout the whole liver with approximate 50 000
   voxels, voxelwise HEF quantifications were estimated and compared
   between using arterial input function (AIF) from the heart and using
   vascular input function (VIF) from the spleen. The correlation between
   mean of the HEFs over the nontumor liver tissue and the overall liver
   function measured by Indocyanine green clearance half-time (T1/2) was
   assessed. Variation of the voxelwise estimation was evaluated in ROIs
   drawn in relatively homogeneous regions of the livers. The authors also
   examined effects of the time range parameter on the voxelwise HEF
   quantification.
   Results: Mean of the HEFs over the liver estimated using AIF
   significantly correlated with the physiological measurement T1/2 (r =
   0.52, p = 0.0004), and the correlation was greatly improved by using VIF
   (r = 0.79, p < 0.0001). The parameter of time range for the retention
   phase did not lead to a significant difference in the means of the HEFs
   in the ROIs. Using VIF and a retention phase time range of 7-30 min, the
   relative variation of the voxelwise HEF in the ROIs was 10\% +/- 6\% of
   respective mean HEF.
   Conclusions: The voxelwise HEF derived from 99mTc-IDA SPECT by the
   deconvolution analysis is feasible to assess the spatial distribution of
   hepatic function in the liver. (C) 2013 American Association of

Abstract = {{Aligned nanofibers topographically direct regenerating neurites in
   injured peripheral nerve. Schwann cells (SC) are vital to nerve repair;
   nerve guides seeded with SC promote better regeneration than those
   without. Because one of the roles of SC in nerve regeneration is
   topographic guidance, as the bands of Biingner, we hypothesized that
   nanofibers might similarly facilitate neurite growth if the number of SC
   was decreased. Aligned nanofibers were electrospun and coated with
   polylysine. Embryonic day 15 rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were cultured
   on nanofibers for 3 days in defined media, both with and without
   aphidicolin, which prevented Schwarm cell proliferation. The lengths of
   the longest neurites in each of 10 regions around each DRG were
   measured. We also measured the position of the SC nucleus farthest along
   the path of each measured neurite. Total number of SC for each ganglion
   was counted using an image analysis program. Without aphidicolin,
   neurite lengths were equal on nanofibers and glass controls. In the
   presence of aphidicolin, neurite length on nanofibers and glass was
   equal. Aphidicolin decreased the number of SC on both nanofibers and
   glass. Unexpectedly, aphidicolin decreased the distance SC migrated on
   glass, but had no effect on SC migration on nanofibers. These data
   suggest that nanofibers may support SC migration even in the setting of
   reduced Schwarm cell number. Even though nanofibers had no effect on
   neurite length in the setting of reduced Schwann cells, the ability of
   nanofibers to support Schwann cell migration suggests they may have an
   important role in peripheral nerve regeneration scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{Interactive media-based services and applications have become ubiquitous
   and compete for our attention in our everyday lives. Similarly,
   operators in many data-rich event-driven workplaces, such as aviation,
   medicine, and process control, experience considerable attentional
   demands, as they assume new responsibilities and interact with a growing
   number of automated systems. These trends have led to an increased risk
   of frequent and sometimes untimely interruptions. Supporting the
   effective management of these interruptions is critical to avoid
   performance breakdowns on both the ongoing and the interrupting tasks.
   One promising means of achieving this goal is the introduction of
   multimodal interfaces that distribute information across sensory
   channels to ensure the reliable and timely detection, accurate
   interpretation, and appropriate handling of interrupting tasks and
   signals. This paper will provide a brief overview of well-known models

Abstract = {{This paper studies the operation of an electric grid with renewable wind
   generation and plug-in electric. vehicles (PEVs). In particular, PEVs
   will be the controllable demand that can mitigate the intermittency in
   wind generation and improve the capacity factors of the non-renewable
   generation assets on the grid. Optimization problems are formulated to
   minimize the costs of electricity generation, and two approaches are
   proposed to address the grid CO2 emission in the optimization. The first
   approach directly penalizes CO2 in the objective function, and the
   second approach adopts a carbon disincentive policy to alter the
   dispatch order of power plants, so that expensive low-CO2 plants can
   replace cheap high-CO2 plants. These two approaches result in very
   different outcomes: the first approach affects only the PEV charging
   demand on the grid and does not result in significant CO2 reduction,
   whereas the second approach controls both the generation and load, and
   CO2 can be reduced substantially. In addition, the carbon disincentive
   policy, unlike a carbon tax, does not collect any revenue; therefore,
   the increase in electricity cost is minimal. The effect of the proposed
   algorithms on the grid electricity cost and carbon emission is analyzed
   in details and reported. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique to guarantee, with specified
   probability, that a steady flight state can be maintained when
   stochastic wind gusts act upon an airplane. The technique allows
   quantification of the probability that the plane leaves its flight
   envelope because of gusts, risking damage or loss of control. The paper
   presents linearized, time-invariant dynamic equations for the airplane
   with gust velocity as the input. It treats the gust velocity as a
   stationary random process and appends a coloring filter to the
   linearized airplane equations so that the input is Gaussian white noise.
   The paper analyzes the effect of this noise on the airplane's dynamics,
   introducing the notion of stationary flight and a stationary flight
   envelope to guarantee, with specified probability, steady flight under
   such conditions. It presents a numerical example of a general aviation
   aircraft performing various steady flight maneuvers in moderate
   turbulence, showing substantial reductions in the steady flight envelope
   for some combinations of maneuvers, turbulence, and safety margins. It
   also shows how feedback control can enlarge the stationary flight
   envelope by alleviating gust loads but concludes that, for the aircraft
   and controller examined, actuator limitations hinder gust alleviation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1167-1179}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{High-frequency (100-500 Hz) oscillations (HFOs) recorded from
   intracranial electrodes are a potential biomarker for epileptogenic
   brain. HFOs are commonly categorized as ripples (100-250 Hz) or fast
   ripples (250-500 Hz), and a third class of mixed frequency events has
   also been identified. We hypothesize that temporal changes in HFOs may
   identify periods of increased the likelihood of seizure onset. HFOs
   (86,151) from five patients with neocortical epilepsy implanted with
   hybrid (micro + macro) intracranial electrodes were detected using a
   previously validated automated algorithm run over all channels of each
   patient's entire recording. HFOs were characterized by extracting
   quantitative morphologic features and divided into four time epochs
   (interictal, preictal, ictal, and postictal) and three HFO clusters
   (ripples, fast ripples, and mixed events). We used supervised
   classification and nonparametric statistical tests to explore
   quantitative changes in HFO features before, during, and after seizures.
   We also analyzed temporal changes in the rates and proportions of events
   from each HFO cluster during these periods. We observed patient-specific
   changes in HFO morphology linked to fluctuation in the relative rates of
   ripples, fast ripples, and mixed frequency events. These changes in
   relative rate occurred in pre- and postictal periods up to thirty min
   before and after seizures. We also found evidence that the distribution
   of HFOs during these different time periods varied greatly between
   individual patients. These results suggest that temporal analysis of HFO
   features has potential for designing custom seizure prediction
   algorithms and for exploring the relationship between HFOs and seizure
   generation.}},

Abstract = {{Benzene and dibenzofuran form directly from phenol and account for
   nearly all phenol consumption during its uncatalyzed gasification in
   supercritical water at 500-700 degrees C. Experiments with dibenzofuran
   as the starting reactant generated the same array of products typically
   in comparable quantities-as that observed previously with phenol as
   reactant: H-2, CO, CO2, CH4, 2-phenylphenol, polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, char, biphenyl, benzene, and even phenol. When benzene was
   the reactant, biphenyl was the main product and some H-2 formed.
   Information about the reaction pathways obtained from these experiments
   served as the basis for constructing a kinetic model that describes the
   reaction rates of phenol and its primary and gaseous products in
   supercritical water. We report Arrhenius parameters, and we analyze the
   formation and consumption rates for each species as calculated by the
   model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ORAL ONCOLOGY}},

Volume = {{49}},

Pages = {{845-853}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Emerging evidence suggests the existence of a tumorigenic population of
   cancer cells that demonstrate stem cell-like properties such as
   self-renewal and multipotency. These cells, termed cancer stem cells
   (CSC), are able to both initiate and maintain tumor formation and
   progression. Studies have shown that CSC are resistant to traditional
   chemotherapy treatments preventing complete eradication of the tumor
   cell population. Following treatment, CSC are able to re-initiate tumor
   growth leading to patient relapse. Salivary gland cancers are relatively
   rare but constitute a highly significant public health issue due to the
   lack of effective treatments. In particular, patients with
   mucoepidermoid carcinoma or adenoid cystic carcinoma, the two most
   common salivary malignancies, have low long-term survival rates due to
   the lack of response to current therapies. Considering the role of CSC
   in resistance to therapy in other tumor types, it is possible that this
   unique sub-population of cells is involved in resistance of salivary
   gland tumors to treatment. Characterization of CSC can lead to better
   understanding of the pathobiology of salivary gland malignancies as well
   as to the development of more effective therapies. Here, we make a brief
   overview of the state-of-the-science in salivary gland cancer, and
   discuss possible implications of the cancer stem cell hypothesis to the
   treatment of salivary gland malignancies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A major practical challenge in heterogeneous catalysis is to minimize
   the loading of expensive platinum group metals (PGMs) without degrading
   the overall catalytic efficiency. Gaining a thorough atomic-scale
   understanding of the chemical/structural changes occurring during
   catalyst manufacture/operation could potentially enable the design and
   production of ``nano-engineered{''} catalysts, optimized for cost,
   stability and performance. In the present study, the oxidation behavior
   of a Pt-31 at\% Pd alloy between 673-1073 K is investigated using atom
   probe tomography (APT). Over this range of temperatures, three markedly
   different chemical structures are observed near the surface of the
   alloy. At 673 K, the surface oxide formed is enriched with Pd, the
   concentration of which rises further following oxidation at 773 K.
   During oxidation at 873 K, a thick, stable oxide layer is formed on the
   surface with a stoichiometry of PdO, beneath which a Pd-depleted
   (Pt-rich) layer exists. Above 873 K, the surface composition switches to
   enrichment in Pt, with the Pt content increasing further with increasing
   oxidation temperature. This treatment suggests a route for tuning the
   surfaces of Pt-Pd nanoparticles to be either Pd-rich or Pt-rich, simply
   by adjusting the oxidation temperatures in order to form two different
   types of core-shell structures. In addition, comparison of the oxidation
   behavior of Pt Pd with Pt Rh and Pd Rh alloys demonstrates markedly
   different trends under the same conditions for these three binary
   alloys. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Oxide nanoclusters in a consolidated Fe-14Cr-2W-0.3Ti-0.3Y(2)O(3) ODS
   steel and in the alloy powder after mechanical alloying (but before
   consolidation) are investigated by atom probe tomography (APT). The
   maximum separation method is a standard method to define and
   characterise clusters from within APT data, but this work shows that the
   extent of clustering between the two materials is sufficiently different
   that the nanoclusters in the mechanically alloyed powder and in the
   consolidated material cannot be compared directly using the same cluster
   selection parameters. As the cluster selection parameters influence the
   size and composition of the clusters significantly, a procedure to
   optimise the input parameters for the maximum separation method is
   proposed by sweeping the d(max) and N-min parameter space. By applying
   this method of cluster parameter selection combined with a `matrix
   correction' to account for trajectory aberrations, differences in the
   oxide nanoclusters can then be reliably quantified. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background. Blood product transfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass has
   been demonstrated to be associated with increased morbidity and
   mortality in adult cardiac surgery populations. The aim of this study
   was to characterize the risk-adjusted occurrence of postoperative
   complications and mortality in relation to intraoperative blood product
   transfusion in our pediatric cardiac surgery population.
   Methods. A retrospective review was performed on 1,631 consecutive
   cardiopulmonary bypass cases to determine the effects of intraoperative
   blood product transfusion on selected outcomes. After adjusting for
   patient and operative risk factors, multivariate analysis was performed
   to determine the association between blood product transfusion and
   postoperative complications. Cox proportional hazards model was used to
   examine the relationship of packed red blood cell transfusion to
   hospital length of stay.
   Results. Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusion was
   associated with pulmonary complications (adjusted odds ratio, 1.55; 95\%
   confidence interval, 1.05 to 2.28; p = 0.03). Red blood cell transfusion
   also correlated with prolonged hospital stay (p < 0.01). Cryoprecipate
   transfusion was associated with postoperative pulmonary complications
   (adjusted odds ratio, 1.79; 95\% confidence interval, 1.13 to 2.55; p =
   0.01), but decreased incidence of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio,
   0.44; 95\% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.85; p = 0.02). Platelet
   transfusion was associated with decreased 30-day mortality (adjusted
   odds ratio, 0.51; 95\% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.93; p = 0.04), but
   not overall mortality.
   Conclusions. Blood product transfusion was associated with an increased
   incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and prolonged
   hospital length of stay, but not overall mortality. These findings
   suggest that minimizing blood product transfusion would be beneficial in
   the pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass surgery patient population. (C)

Abstract = {{We report on a Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 (CIGS) solar cell fabricated on flexible
   stainless steel substrate by a low cost mass production roll-to-roll
   process. Fabricated device has a high energy conversion efficiency of
   14\%, with short circuit current density (J(sc)) of 36.6 mA cm(-2) and
   open circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.55 V. A two-dimensional (2D) simulation
   model for CIGS solar cell design and optimization was proposed.
   Opto-electrical properties showed that both experimental and simulated
   results are consistent with each other. The photons absorber in CIGS
   solar cells was prepared by co-sputtering metallic precursors of In and
   CuGa followed by thermal annealing in Se vapor. The device chemical
   properties were analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and
   transmission/scan electron microscopy (TEM/SEM). Indium and gallium
   interdiffusions were observed during the growth of film, forming a band
   grading in CIGS layer. Accumulation of In at the top CIGS surface,
   resulting in a low bandgap, was responsible for the limited output open
   circuit voltage. Nano-scale voids were observed in the grown CIGS layer.
   A model based on Kirkendal effect and interdiffusion of atoms during
   selenization is developed to explain the formation mechanism of these
   voids. Na and K incorporation as well as metallic impurities diffusion
   are also discussed. (C) 2013 The Japan Society of Applied Physics}},

Abstract = {{Pure erbium (Er) film was grown on molybdenum substrate by an
   electron-beam evaporation deposition technique. Cracks along the OM
   crystal planes of ErD2 lattice have been found to grow in ErD2 films
   synthesized by deuteration of metal Er films. The preferentially
   orientated cracks consist of polycrystalline Er2O3 particles, which are
   well confirmed by chemical analysis via X-ray energy dispersive
   spectroscopy (EDS) element mapping and selected area electron
   diffraction (SAED) performed in a transmission electron microscope
   (TEM). Two main factors are thought to account for the formation of the
   orientated cracks. One is the increase in local stresses caused by the
   phase transformation from Er to ErD2, the other is the oxygen diffusion
   to the favored sites in ErD2 lattice during deuteration processing. (C)

   reactivity insertion experiments conducted in the 1950s. This paper
   describes the validation of the U.S. NRC coupled code system

   using several of the SPERT III tests. The NRC coupled code system was
   used to perform the SPERT III E-Core configuration tests in which the
   RIA was initiated by the rapid ejection of a central cruciform control
   rod. The resulting superprompt reactivity excursion and negative Doppler
   reactivity feedback produced the familiar bell-shaped power increase and
   decrease. The energy deposition during such a power excursion has
   important safety consequences, and the SPERT III tests provide a
   validation basis for the NRC coupled multiphysics codes. The models were

Abstract = {{We consider a remote estimation problem with an energy harvesting sensor
   and a remote estimator. The sensor observes the state of a discrete-time
   source which may be a finite state Markov chain or a multidimensional
   linear Gaussian system. It harvests energy from its environment (say,
   for example, through a solar cell) and uses this energy for the purpose
   of communicating with the estimator. Due to randomness of the energy
   available for communication, the sensor may not be able to communicate
   all of the time. The sensor may also want to save its energy for future
   communications. The estimator relies on messages communicated by the
   sensor to produce real-time estimates of the source state. We consider
   the problem of finding a communication scheduling strategy for the
   sensor and an estimation strategy for the estimator that jointly
   minimizes the expected sum of communication and distortion costs over a
   finite time horizon. Our goal of joint optimization leads to a
   decentralized decision-making problem. By viewing the problem from the
   estimator's perspective, we obtain a dynamic programming
   characterization for the decentralized decision-making problem that
   involves optimization over functions. Under some symmetry assumptions on
   the source statistics and the distortion metric, we show that an optimal
   communication strategy is described by easily computable thresholds and
   that the optimal estimate is a simple function of the most recently
   received sensor observation.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamical phenomenon of cyclic variability in combustion governed by
   autoignition in homogeneous charge compression ignition engines with
   large amounts of residual gases is investigated. A novel model is
   derived with two states that capture the coupling between engine cycles
   due to the thermal energy in the recycled residual gases and the
   recycled chemical energy in the unburned fuel. With the parameters tuned
   to data from a single cylinder engine at one level of residuals, the
   model predictions agree well with the experimental observations of
   decreasing residuals, which are associated with later phasing and
   increasing cyclic variability approaching misfire. A stability analysis
   of the model with respect to the amount of recycled residual gases shows
   how instabilities develop and that the dynamic behavior of the
   combustion phasing from cycle to cycle is stable for a range of residual
   gas fractions. The model and analysis offers an explanation for the
   experimentally observed cycle-to-cycle variability, and provides a
   foundation for further analysis as well as development of controls
   mitigating the variability.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetically driven mechanical systems are characterized by fast
   nonlinear dynamics that are subject to physical and performance
   constraints, which makes controller design a challenging problem.
   Although model predictive control (MPC) is well suited for dealing with
   constraints, the fast dynamics of electromagnetic (EM) actuators render
   most standard MPC approaches impractical. This paper proposes a
   horizon-1 MPC strategy that can handle both the state/input constraints
   and the computational complexity limitations associated with EM actuator
   applications. A flexible Lyapunov function is employed to obtain a
   nonconservative stability guarantee for the horizon-1 MPC scheme.
   Moreover, an invariant region of attraction is provided for the
   closed-loop MPC system. The simulation results obtained on a validated
   model of an EM engine valve actuator show that performance is improved
   with respect to previous strategies, and that the proposed algorithm can
   run within a sampling period in the order of a millisecond.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium ion batteries should always be prevented from overheating and,
   hence, thermal monitoring is indispensable. Since only the surface
   temperature of the battery can be measured, a thermal model is needed to
   estimate the core temperature of the battery, which can be higher and
   more critical. In this paper, an online parameter identification scheme
   is designed for a cylindrical lithium ion battery. An adaptive observer
   of the core temperature is then designed based on the online
   parameterization methodology and the surface temperature measurement. A
   battery thermal model with constant internal resistance is explored
   first. The identification algorithm and the adaptive observer is
   validated with experiments on a 2.3Ah 26650 lithium iron
   phosphate/graphite battery. The methodology is later extended to address
   temperature-dependent internal resistance with nonuniform forgetting
   factors. The ability of the methodology to track the long-term variation
   of the internal resistance is beneficial for battery health monitoring.}},

Volume = {{145}},

Abstract = {{Over the past years, rebates have been increasingly used by national
   brand (NB) manufacturers. Conventional wisdom suggests that rebates are
   beneficial to firms as long as positive slippage exists. Based on the
   present-biased preference theory, we investigate the performance of NB
   rebates as a counterstrategy to the retailer's private label (PL). Game
   theoretic models are developed to characterize channel dynamics.
   Involving consumers' knowledge levels of the present-biased preferences,
   our model reveals multiple insights. First, a positive slippage rate
   does not necessarily benefit the NB manufacturer if the rebates fail to
   expand the demand of the NB. Second, the retailer's commitment to the
   original NB price plays a positive role in improving the equilibrium
   profits of both parties. Third, for loss-averse consumers under
   preference uncertainties, the NB manufacturer and the retailer prefer a
   low redemption cost, in contrary to the conventional idea that sellers
   take advantage of consumers with high redemption costs. (C) 2013

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{262}},
Pages = {{180-188}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{When applied to reactivity initiated accidents (RIAs) analysis, codes
   such as DeCART can provide a detailed radial, azimuth, and axial power
   distribution within a fuel rod. The work reported here is aimed at
   quantifying the sensitivity of the cladding thermo-mechanical response,
   calculated by the fuel performance code FALCON to the more accurate and
   detailed neutronic solution provided by DeCART for full PWR core RIA
   analysis. As a basis of comparison, the neutronics analysis is also
   performed with the U.S. NRC PARCS code, which is representative of the
   methodology used by the industry.
   Based on the DeCART solutions, several fuel rods are chosen for analysis
   with FALCON according to several relevant criteria. For each of the
   selected fuel rods, a FALCON study is performed using the boundary
   conditions provided by the neutronic solvers to predict the cladding
   response in terms of Strain Energy Density (SED) to the power pulse
   during the transient. The results of the analysis led to the following
   conclusions:
   The largest impact on the cladding response can be attributed to the
   differences in the kinetic parameters in PARCS and DeCART.
   The modeling of fuel pin exposure in the current industry standard ``two
   step{''} methodology can result in some significant discrepancies in
   terms of SED during RIA analysis.
   The effect of azimuthal power variation within a given fuel rod has a
   10\% impact on the SED and should be taken into consideration during RIA
   analysis, especially for high exposure fuel. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The principle of velocity decomposition is used to combine field
   discretization and boundary-element techniques to solve for steady,
   viscous, external flows around bodies. The decomposition modifies the
   Navier-Stokes boundary-value problem and produces a Laplace problem for
   a viscous potential, and a new Navier-Stokes sub-problem that can be
   solved on the portion of the domain where the total velocity has
   rotation. The key development in the decomposition is the formulation
   for the boundary condition on the viscous potential that couples the two
   components of velocity. An iterative numerical scheme is described to
   solve the decomposed problem. Results are shown for the steady laminar
   flow over a sectional airfoil, a circular cylinder with separation, and
   the turbulent flow around a slender body-of-revolution. The results show
   the viscous potential is obtainable even for massively separated flows,
   and the field discretization must only encompass the vortical region of
   the total velocity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper establishes rates attainable by several lossy schemes for
   coding a continuous parameter source to a specified mean-squared-error
   distortion based on sampling at asymptotically large rates. First, a
   densely sampled, spatiotemporal, stationary Gaussian source is
   distributively encoded. The Berger-Tung bound to the distributed
   rate-distortion function and three convergence theorems are used to
   obtain an upper bound, expressed in terms of the source spectral
   density, to the smallest attainable rate at asymptotically large
   sampling rates. The bound is tighter than that recently obtained by
   Kashyap et al. Both indicate that with ideal distributed lossy coding,
   dense sensor networks can efficiently sense and convey a field, in
   contrast to the negative result obtained by Marco et al. for encoders
   based on scalar quantization and Slepian-Wolf distributed lossless
   coding. The second scheme is transform coding with scalar coefficient
   quantization. A new generalized transform coding analysis, as well as
   the aforementioned convergence theorems, is used to find the smallest
   attainable rate at asymptotically large sampling rates in terms of the
   source spectral density and the operational rate-distortion function of
   the family of quantizers, which in contrast to previous analyses need
   not be convex. The result shows that when a transform is used, scalar
   quantization need not cause the poor performance found by Marco et al.
   As a corollary, the final result pursues an approach, originally
   proposed by Berger, to show that the inverse water-pouring formula for
   the rate-distortion function can be attained at high sampling rates by
   transform coding with ideal vector quantization to encode the
   coefficients. Also established in the paper are relations between
   operational rate-distortion and distortion-rate functions for a
   continuous parameter source and those for the discrete parameter source
   that results from sampling.}},

Abstract = {{The current efficiency of monolithic (including two-layer) radiant

   temperature and raises the flame temperature locally above the adiabatic
   temperature (superadiabatic flame) for the fuel-lean conditions. The
   heat from the superadiabatic region is then extracted and conducted
   through embedded, high-thermal conductivity radiation corridors and is
   radiated, at a higher temperature than the flue gas, to the target. The
   analyses of local thermal non-equilibrium among the gas phase, two-layer
   porous solid, preheating heat exchanger, and radiant corridor are
   presented for the zeroth-order reaction of premixed methane/air. Radiant

Abstract = {{Five midsagittal pelvic reference lines have been employed to quantify
   prolapse using MRI. However, the lack of standardization makes study
   results difficult to compare. Using MRI scans from 149 women, we
   demonstrate how use of existing reference lines can systematically
   affect measurements in three distinct ways: in oblique line systems,
   distances measured to the reference line vary with antero-posterior
   location; soft issue-based reference lines can underestimate organ
   movement relative to the pelvic bones; and systems defined relative to
   the MR scanner are affected by intra- and interindividual differences in
   the pelvic inclination angle at rest and strain. Thus, we propose a
   standardized approach called the Pelvic Inclination Correction System
   (PICS). Based on bony structures and the body axis, the PICS system
   corrects for variation in pelvic inclination, at rest of straining, and
   allows for the standardized measurement of organ displacement in the

Title = {{Applying active learning to supervised word sense disambiguation in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1001-1006}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   This study was to assess whether active learning strategies can be
   integrated with supervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) methods, thus
   reducing the number of annotated samples, while keeping or improving the
   quality of disambiguation models.
   Methods
   We developed support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to disambiguate
   197 ambiguous terms and abbreviations in the MSH WSD collection. Three
   different uncertainty sampling-based active learning algorithms were
   implemented with the SVM classifiers and were compared with a passive
   learner (PL) based on random sampling. For each ambiguous term and each
   learning algorithm, a learning curve that plots the accuracy computed
   from the test set as a function of the number of annotated samples used
   in the model was generated. The area under the learning curve (ALC) was
   used as the primary metric for evaluation.
   Results
   Our experiments demonstrated that active learners (ALs) significantly
   outperformed the PL, showing better performance for 177 out of 197
   (89.8\%) WSD tasks. Further analysis showed that to achieve an average
   accuracy of 90\%, the PL needed 38 annotated samples, while the ALs
   needed only 24, a 37\% reduction in annotation effort. Moreover, we
   analyzed cases where active learning algorithms did not achieve superior
   performance and identified three causes: (1) poor models in the early
   learning stage; (2) easy WSD cases; and (3) difficult WSD cases, which
   provide useful insight for future improvements.
   Conclusions
   This study demonstrated that integrating active learning strategies with
   supervised WSD methods could effectively reduce annotation cost and
   improve the disambiguation models.}},

Abstract = {{The primary goal of a residency program is to prepare trainees for
   unsupervised care. Duty hour restrictions imposed throughout the prior
   decade require that residents work significantly fewer hours. Moreover,
   various stakeholders (e.g. the hospital, mentors, other residents,
   educators, and patients) require them to prioritize very different
   activities, often conflicting with their learning goals. Surgical
   residents' learning goals include providing continuity throughout a
   patient's pre-, peri-, and post-operative care as well as achieving
   sufficient surgical experience levels in various procedure types and
   participating in various formal educational activities, among other
   things. To complicate matters, senior residents often compete with other
   residents for surgical experience. This paper features experiments using
   an optimization model and a real dataset. The experiments test the
   viability of achieving the above goals at a major academic center using
   existing models of delivering medical education and training to surgical
   residents. It develops a detailed multi-objective, two-stage stochastic
   optimization model with anticipatory capabilities solved over a rolling
   time horizon. A novel feature of the models is the incorporation of
   learning curve theory in the objection function. Using a deterministic
   version of the model, we identify bounds on the achievement of learning
   goals under existing training paradigms. The computational results
   highlight the structural problems in the current surgical resident
   educational system. These results further corroborate earlier findings
   and suggest an educational system redesign is necessary for surgical
   medical residents.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology to construct novel label-free sensing
   platforms using carefully engineered materials (metamaterials) that have
   dimensions considerably smaller than the operating wavelength, lambda.
   This paper demonstrates that highly selective sensing platforms can be
   achieved by using metamaterials consisting of periodic arrays of
   capacitive and inductive elements. Specifically, this paper gives the
   design of the following four basic sensing parameters of sensing
   platforms: 1) resonant frequency omega(0); 2) resonant frequency shift
   Delta omega(0); 3) bandwidth B; and 4) transmission ratio T. Using this
   approach, the bandwidth B and resonant frequency omega(0) can easily be
   modulated by using different combination sets of metallic patch elements
   and metallic wire elements. Equivalent circuit analysis and numerical
   methods have been applied to determine the basic sensing design rules
   for constructing periodic arrays of capacitive and inductive elements,
   and the efficiency of the obtained label-free sensing architectures has
   been evaluated. The overall contribution of this paper is to develop a
   methodology for designing highly selective biosensors by optimizing the
   dimensions of underlying circuit at the subwavelength scale.}},

Abstract = {{The theoretical lower limit of subthreshold swing in MOSFETs (60
   mV/decade) significantly restricts low-voltage operation since it
   results in a low ON-to-OFF current ratio at low supply voltages. This
   paper investigates extremely low-power circuits based on new Si/SiGe
   heterojunction tunneling transistors (HETTs) that have a subthreshold
   swing of <60 mV/decade. Device characteristics, as determined through
   technology computer aided design tools, are used to develop a Verilog-A
   device model to simulate and evaluate a range of HETT-based circuits. We
   show that an HETT-based ring oscillator (RO) shows a 9-19 times
   reduction in dynamic power compared to a CMOS RO. We also explore two
   key differences between HETTs and traditional MOSFETs, namely,
   asymmetric current flow and increased Miller capacitance, analyze their
   effect on circuit behavior, and propose methods to address them. HETT
   characteristics have the most dramatic impact on static random access
   memory (SRAM) operation and we propose a novel seven-transistor
   HETT-based SRAM cell topology to overcome, and take advantage of, the
   asymmetric current flow. This new HETT SRAM design achieves 7-37 times
   reduction in leakage power compared to CMOS.}},

Abstract = {{Tensile stress develops in concrete when shrinkage deformations and
   restraints (internal or external) exist. Utilization of appropriate
   creep or relaxation functions is crucial for assessing stress and the
   associated cracking potential in concrete, especially at early ages when
   chemical and physical properties change rapidly. The existing models,
   developed either from compressive creep tests or conventional tensile
   creep tests with constant loads applied at certain ages, were found to
   be unsuitable for such stress evaluation. This study was performed to
   investigate the restrained strain-stress development and tensile creep
   behavior of concrete subject to constant restraint starting at very
   early ages, which well represents field conditions of actual structures.
   Restrained stresses were measured using a specially designed frame. The
   concretes were cured and tested at two different temperatures (23
   degrees C versus 33 degrees C) and ground granulated blast furnace slag
   contents (0\% versus 30\% of the total cementitious materials by mass).
   A modified tensile creep model is proposed to account for the high
   viscosity of concrete under constantly restrained conditions, allowing
   more accurate assessments of stress and cracking potential in structures
   such as slabs or pavements on the ground.}},

Abstract = {{Relative displacement, which is displacement of a point on a structure
   with respect to its original location or an adjacent point on the
   structure that has also undergone movement, can be an effective
   indicator of postevent structural damage. Although quantifying relative
   deformations for postevent damage quantification is currently
   technically feasible, and of great potential benefit, the field remains
   undeveloped because of lack of knowledge among structural engineers of
   (1) the enabling technologies and (2) the performance limits of these
   technologies. The primary objectives of this paper are to review
   available techniques for measuring relative deformations, identify their
   limitations, and propose areas where further research is needed. Current
   methodologies are divided into remote and in situ methods. The latter
   techniques are deemed most practically feasible and are surveyed in
   detail and critiqued. Suggestions for current challenges and research
   opportunities are proposed with emphasis on accuracy considerations, the
   need for creating a national database of structure information, and
   methods for large-scale automated assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable bone dysplasia characterized
   by increased skeletal fragility. Patients are often treated with
   bisphosphonates to attempt to reduce fracture risk. However,
   bisphosphonates reside in the skeleton for many years and long-term
   administration may impact bone material quality. Acutely, there is
   concern about risk of non-union of fractures that occur near the time of
   bisphosphonate administration. This study investigated the effect of
   alendronate, a potent aminobisphosphonate, on fracture healing. Using
   the Brtl/+ murine model of type IV OI, tibial fractures were generated
   in 8-week-old mice that were untreated, treated with alendronate before
   fracture, or treated before and after fracture. After 2, 3, or 5 weeks
   of healing, tibiae were assessed using microcomputed tomography (mu CT),
   torsion testing, quantitative histomorphometry, and Raman
   microspectroscopy. There were no morphologic, biomechanical or
   histomorphometric differences in callus between untreated mice and mice
   that received alendronate before fracture. Alendronate treatment before
   fracture did not cause a significant increase in cartilage retention in
   fracture callus. Both Brtl/+ and WT mice that received alendronate
   before and after fracture had increases in the callus volume, bone
   volume fraction and torque at failure after 5 weeks of healing. Raman
   microspectroscopy results did not show any effects of alendronate in
   wild-type mice, but calluses from Brtl+ mice treated with alendronate
   during healing had a decreased mineral-to-matrix ratio, decreased
   crystallinity and an increased carbonate-to-phosphate ratio. Treatment
   with alendronate altered the dynamics of healing by preventing callus
   volume decreases later in the healing process. Fracture healing in
   Brtl/+ untreated animals was not significantly different from animals in
   which alendronate was halted at the time of fracture. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Multihop wireless relays can extend the area of network connectivity
   instantly and efficiently. However, due to the spatial dependence of
   wireless link-quality, the deployment of relay nodes requires extensive,
   expensive measurement, and management efforts. This paper presents a
   mobile autonomous router system, (MARS) through which a relay router
   autonomously seeks and adjusts the best ``reception{''} position for
   itself and cooperatively forms a string-type relay network with other
   neighboring routers. Specifically, MARS 1) accurately characterizes
   spatial link-quality through a new measurement technique, 2) effectively
   probes/optimizes node positioning via a spatial probing algorithm, and
   3) maintains error-tolerant position information via an inexpensive
   positioning algorithm. MARS has been prototyped with both a commodity
   mobile robot and a wireless router with IEEE 802.11 cards. Our
   experimental evaluation of both the MARS prototype and ns-2-based
   simulation show that MARS achieves an average of 95 percent accuracy in
   link-quality measurements, and reduces the measurement effort necessary
   for the optimization of a node's location by two-thirds, compared to
   exhaustive spatial probing.}},

Abstract = {{Being readily available in most of 802.11 radios, multirate capability
   appears to be useful as WiFi networks are getting more prevalent and
   crowded. More specifically, it would be helpful in high-density
   scenarios because internode distance is short enough to employ high data
   rates. However, communication at high data rates mandates a large number
   of hops for a given node pair in a multihop network and thus, can easily
   be depreciated as per-hop overhead at several layers of network protocol
   is aggregated over the increased number of hops. This paper presents a
   novel multihop, multirate adaptation mechanism, called multihop
   transmission opportunity (MTOP), that allows a frame to be forwarded a
   number of hops consecutively to minimize the MAC-layer overhead between
   hops. This seemingly collision-prone nonstop forwarding is proved to be
   safe via analysis and USRP/GNU Radio-based experiment in this paper. The
   idea of MTOP is in clear contrast to the conventional opportunistic
   transmission mechanism, known as TXOP, where a node transmits multiple
   frames back-to-back when it gets an opportunity in a single-hop WLAN. We
   conducted an extensive simulation study via OPNET, demonstrating the
   performance advantage of MTOP under a wide range of network scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of active diagnosis arises in several applications such as
   disease diagnosis and fault diagnosis in computer networks, where the
   goal is to rapidly identify the binary states of a set of objects (e.g.,
   faulty or working) by sequentially selecting, and observing, potentially
   noisy responses to binary valued queries. Previous work in this area
   chooses queries sequentially based on Information gain, and the object
   states are inferred by maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. In this
   work, rather than MAP estimation, we aim to rank objects according to
   their posterior fault probability. We propose a greedy algorithm to
   choose queries sequentially by maximizing the area under the ROC curve
   associated with the ranked list. The proposed algorithm overcomes
   limitations of existing work. When multiple faults may be present, the
   proposed algorithm does not rely on belief propagation, making it
   feasible for large scale networks with little loss in performance. When
   a single fault is present, the proposed algorithm can be implemented
   without knowledge of the underlying query noise distribution, making it
   robust to any misspecification of these noise parameters. We demonstrate
   the performance of the proposed algorithm through experiments on
   computer networks, a toxic chemical database, and synthetic datasets.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel, linear programming (LP)-based scheduling algorithm
   that exploits heterogeneous multicore architectures such as CPUs and
   GPUs to accelerate a wide variety of proximity queries. To represent
   complicated performance relationships between heterogeneous
   architectures and different computations of proximity queries, we
   propose a simple, yet accurate model that measures the expected running
   time of these computations. Based on this model, we formulate an
   optimization problem that minimizes the largest time spent on computing
   resources, and propose a novel, iterative LP-based scheduling algorithm.
   Since our method is general, we are able to apply our method into
   various proximity queries used in five different applications that have
   different characteristics. Our method achieves an order of magnitude
   performance improvement by using four different GPUs and two hexa-core
   CPUs over using a hexa-core CPU only. Unlike prior scheduling methods,
   our method continually improves the performance, as we add more
   computing resources. Also, our method achieves much higher performance
   improvement compared with prior methods as heterogeneity of computing
   resources is increased. Moreover, for one of tested applications, our
   method achieves even higher performance than a prior parallel method
   optimized manually for the application. We also show that our method
   provides results that are close (e.g., 75 percent) to the performance
   provided by a conservative upper bound of the ideal throughput. These
   results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our algorithm that
   have not been achieved by prior methods. In addition, we integrate one
   of our contributions with a work stealing method. Our version of the
   work stealing method achieves 18 percent performance improvement on
   average over the original work stealing method. This result shows wide
   applicability of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting objects, estimating their pose, and recovering their 3D shape
   are critical problems in many vision and robotics applications. This
   paper addresses the above needs using a two stages approach. In the
   first stage, we propose a new method called DEHV - Depth-Encoded Hough
   Voting. DEHV jointly detects objects, infers their categories, estimates
   their pose, and infers/decodes objects depth maps from either a single
   image (when no depth maps are available in testing) or a single image
   augmented with depth map (when this is available in testing). Inspired
   by the Hough voting scheme introduced in {[}1], DEHV incorporates depth
   information into the process of learning distributions of image features
   (patches) representing an object category. DEHV takes advantage of the
   interplay between the scale of each object patch in the image and its
   distance (depth) from the corresponding physical patch attached to the
   3D object. Once the depth map is given, a full reconstruction is
   achieved in a second (3D modelling) stage, where modified or
   state-of-the-art 3D shape and texture completion techniques are used to
   recover the complete 3D model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
   experimental analysis on existing datasets {[}2-4] and a newly proposed
   3D table-top object category dataset shows that our DEHV scheme obtains
   competitive detection and pose estimation results. Finally, the quality
   of 3D modelling in terms of both shape completion and texture completion
   is evaluated on a 3D modelling dataset containing both in-door and
   out-door object categories. We demonstrate that our overall algorithm
   can obtain convincing 3D shape reconstruction from just one single
   uncalibrated image. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{An integral type non-local continuum model for epoxy, used as the matrix
   material in aerospace structural composites, is developed from phonon
   dispersion data. Non-local continuum models can be used to regularize
   the stress fields at crack tips and molecular defect cores (e.g.
   disclinations in epoxies) where local (classical) elasticity theories
   fail to give bounded solutions. Integral type non-local elastic models
   phenomenologically incorporate microstructure information through a
   weighting function known as a kernel function. The kernel functions are
   typically obtained by matching dispersion curves computed using lattice
   dynamics. However, the use of lattice dynamics for amorphous polymers
   that do not have an underlying lattice structure is computationally
   prohibitive. In this paper, a molecular dynamics based approach is used
   for the computation of the non-local kernel, for amorphous epoxy.
   Dispersion relations calculated from the reciprocal-space
   velocity-velocity autocorrelation function are used to build the
   kernels. The computed atomistic kernel is used to predict stress
   solutions for some example problems where classical elasticity predicts
   singularities. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Conjugated polymers have been developed as effective
   materials for interfacing prosthetic device electrodes with neural
   tissue. Recent focus has been on the development of conjugated polymers
   that contain biological components in order to improve the tissue
   response upon implantation of these electrodes.
   Methods: Carboxylic acid-functionalized 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene
   (EDOTacid) monomer was synthesized in order to covalently bind peptides
   to the surface of conjugated polymer films. EDOTacid was copolymerized
   with EDOT monomer to form stable, electrically conductive copolymer
   films referred to as PEDOT-PEDOTacid. The peptide GGGGRGDS was bound to
   PEDOT-PEDOTacid to create peptide functionalized PEDOT films.
   Results: The PEDOT-PEDOTacid-peptide films increased the adhesion of
   primary rat motor neurons between 3 and 9 times higher than controls,
   thus demonstrating that the peptide maintained its biological activity.
   Conclusions: The EDOT-acid monomer can be used to create functionalized
   PEDOT-PEDOTacid copolymer films that can have controlled bioactivity.
   General Significance: PEDOT-PEDOTacid-peptide films have the potential
   to control the behavior of neurons and vastly improve the performance of
   implanted electrodes. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled

Title = {{Measurements and statistics of mixture fraction and scalar dissipation

Abstract = {{The present study adds to the limited database of mixture fraction and
   scalar dissipation rate measurements within turbulent flames. One
   noteworthy aspect is that the current measurements are two-dimensional
   images, which provide the physical structure of the scalar dissipation
   rate field. Two turbulent carbon monoxide flames are studied at two
   different jet-exit velocities, where the latter flame is near blowoff.
   The effects of increasing levels of local extinction (by increasing the
   jet velocities) on the structure and statistics of the mixture fraction
   fluctuation and scalar dissipation rate fields are investigated in
   detail. In general, the topology of the scalar dissipation rate layers
   is similar to that found previously in turbulent non-reacting flows,
   with some notable exceptions. For the lower jet-velocity case, the
   dissipation layers were somewhat smooth, isolated, and preferentially
   aligned in the axial direction, while for the higher jet-velocity case
   (near global extinction), the scalar dissipation rate field was
   characterized by an increased number of shorter, thinner, and highly
   wrinkled dissipation layers. It appears that as the flame nears blowoff,
   the scalar dissipation rate field exhibits an increasing level of
   isotropy, resembling turbulent non-reacting flows. In addition to
   providing new insights on the physical nature of the dissipation fields,
   the two-dimensional statistics of the mixture fraction and scalar
   dissipation rate are examined in detail, in the form of conditional
   averaging and through the construction of probability density functions.
   It is found, that although the two flames have apparent differences in
   physical structure, the corresponding statistical properties of the
   scalar dissipation rate were similar. Probability density functions
   (pdfs) of the scalar dissipation rate exhibited large departures from
   strict log-normality and the pdfs of the scalar dissipation rate were
   found to be significantly different if only the values of the scalar
   dissipation conditioned on the stoichiometric contour were considered
   compared to the entire flow-field. This has implications for modeling
   assumptions that seek to describe the entire turbulent flowfield by a
   single pdf. The nature of the scalar dissipation rate in the current
   lower-Reynolds number turbulent flames, as revealed through the
   statistics, is compared to previous, well-known data sets obtained in
   the Sandia series of piloted jet flames as well as other piloted
   non-premixed jet flames at higher Reynolds numbers. The present flame
   conditions are significantly different from previous work, yet the
   general structure, statistical trends, and general effects of increasing
   levels of local extinction agree favorably with the previous
   experimental data. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{134-141}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The durability of concrete repairs is often limited due to restrained
   drying shrinkage. In this study, recycled tire rubber is used to develop
   deliberately low elastic modulus and highly ductile ECC repair material
   so as to alleviate repair failure induced by restrained drying
   shrinkage. Emphasis of this study is placed on the influence of tire
   rubber on the mechanical properties and cracking tendency of ECC repair
   material. It is revealed that the addition of tire rubber in ECC
   mixtures dramatically improves the tensile ductility but lowers the
   compressive strength, tensile strength, and elastic modulus. In spite of
   the increase in free drying shrinkage deformation, the reduction in
   elastic modulus of ECC containing tire rubber is demonstrated to be
   effective in reducing the cracking tendency of ECC repairs, which
   suggests that an improved durability of concrete repairs can be achieved
   by ECC material containing recycled tire rubber. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Systems that produce ranked lists of results are abundant. For instance,
   Web search engines return ranked lists of Web pages. There has been work
   on distance measure for list permutations, like Kendall tau and
   Spearman's footrule, as well as extensions to handle top-k lists, which
   are more common in practice. In addition to ranking whole objects (e.g.,
   Web pages), there is an increasing number of systems that provide
   keyword search on XML or other semistructured data, and produce ranked
   lists of XML sub-trees. Unfortunately, previous distance measures are
   not suitable for ranked lists of sub-trees since they do not account for
   the possible overlap between the returned sub-trees. That is, two
   sub-trees differing by a single node would be considered separate
   objects. In this paper, we present the first distance measures for
   ranked lists of sub-trees, and show under what conditions these measures
   are metrics. Furthermore, we present algorithms to efficiently compute
   these distance Measures. Finally, we evaluate and compare the proposed
   measures on real data using three popular XML keyword proximity search
   systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When a photopolymerizable ceramic suspension is illuminated, the cured
   region is characterized by the cure width and cure depth. The cure depth
   follows a semilogarithmic behavior with increasing energy dose, as
   expected for Beer Lambert absorption, and is described by the depth
   sensitivity (S-d) and depth critical energy dose (E-d). The excess cure
   width, which is the cured width beyond the incident illumination width,
   is also found to increase with the logarithm of energy dose. This
   quasi-Beer Lambert behavior can be described by a width sensitivity
   (S-w) and width critical energy dose (E-w). The semilogarithmic dose
   dependence is demonstrated for ceramic suspensions containing silica,
   mullite, alumina, and zircon powders. Broadening can be quantified by
   the broadening depth (D-b), which is the cure depth at which broadening
   begins to occur. It is shown that the broadening depth decreases with
   the logarithm of the normalized refractive index contrast between the
   powder and monomer solution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of concentration of photoinitiator and concentration of an

Abstract = {{The HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase is a driver oncogene in many human
   cancers, including breast and gastric cancer. Under physiologic levels
   of expression, HER2 heterodimerizes with other members of the EGF
   receptor/HER/ErbB family, and the HER2-HER3 dimer forms one of the most
   potent oncogenic receptor pairs. Previous structural biology studies
   have individually crystallized the kinase domains of HER2 and HER3, but
   the HER2-HER3 kinase domain heterodimer structure has yet to be solved.
   Using a reconstituted membrane system to form HER2-HER3 kinase domain
   heterodimers and carboxyl group foot-printing mass spectrometry, we
   observed that HER2 and HER3 kinase domains preferentially form
   asymmetric heterodimers with HER3 and HER2 monomers occupying the donor
   and acceptor kinase positions, respectively. Conformational changes in
   the HER2 activation loop, as measured by changes in carboxyl group
   labeling, required both dimerization and nucleotide binding but did not
   require activation loop phosphorylation at Tyr-877. Molecular dynamics
   simulations on HER2-HER3 kinase dimers identify specific inter-and
   intramolecular interactions and were in good agreement with MS
   measurements. Specifically, several intermolecular ionic interactions
   between HER2 Lys-716-HER3 Glu-909, HER2 Glu-717-HER3 Lys-907, and HER2
   Asp-871-HER3 Arg-948 were identified by molecular dynamics. We also
   evaluated the effect of the cancer-associated mutations HER2
   D769H/D769Y, HER3 E909G, and HER3 R948K (also numbered HER3 E928G and
   R967K) on kinase activity in the context of this new structural model.
   This study provides valuable insights into the EGF receptor/HER/ErbB
   kinase structure and interactions, which can guide the design of future
   therapies.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that Pd43Ni10Cu27P20 bulk metallic glass (BMG) nanowires,
   prepared by a facile, scalable top-down nanomolding approach, can be
   used as high surface area electrocatalysts for alkaline alcohol fuel
   cell applications. These nanowires exhibit higher activity for methanol
   and ethanol oxidation in alkaline media compared to pure Pd, quantified
   by cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, the Pd-BMG nanowire electrocatalyst
   has a 300 mV lower onset potential for CO oxidation suggesting improved
   poisoning resistance beyond pure Pd. The Pd-BMG electrocatalyst
   activation energies for methanol and ethanol oxidation of 22 and 17 kJ
   mol(-1) are lower than the pure Pd values of 38 and 30 kJ mol(-1),
   respectively. Unique properties of BMGs (homogeneity, viscosity, surface
   tension) facilitate the formability into high surface area
   electrocatalysts at low processing temperatures. The high electrical
   conductivity and chemical/physical stability suggest that these
   materials are ideal candidates for widespread commercial use including
   energy conversion/storage, hydrogen production, and sensors. Copyright

Abstract = {{To improve the performance and durability of a dead-ended anode (DEA)
   fuel cell, it is important to understand and characterize the
   degradation associated with the DEA operation. To this end, the multiple
   degradation phenomena in DEA operation were investigated via systematic
   experiments. Three lifetime degradation tests were conducted with
   different cell temperatures and cathode relative humidities, during
   which the temporal evolutions of cell voltage and high frequency
   resistance (HFR) were recorded. When the cathode supply was fully
   humidified and the cell temperature was mild, the cathode carbon
   corrosion was the predominant degradation observed from scanning
   electronic microscopy (SEM) of postmortem samples. The catalyst layer
   and membrane thickness were measured at multiple locations across the
   cell active area in order to map the degradation patterns. These
   observations confirm a strong correlation between the cathode carbon
   corrosion and the anode fuel starvation occurring near the cell outlet.
   When the cathode supply RH reduced to 50\%, membrane pin-hole failures
   terminated the degradation test. Postmortem analysis showed membrane
   cracks and delamination in the inlet region where membrane water content
   was the lowest. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{We apply phonon and electron nonequilibrium-population statistical
   entropy analysis to the recently introduced phonon energy to electric
   potential conversion heterobarrier with its height optimized for optical
   phonon absorption under steady electric current. The entropy production
   rates for phonon and electron subsystems depend on their interaction
   kinetics and occupancy distributions, indicating the direction of the
   processes. Under upstream thermal equilibrium among electrons and
   acoustic and optical phonons, we predict an upper limit of 42\% energy
   conversion for GaAs heterobarrier at 300 K, while the reported Monte
   Carlo prediction of 19\% efficiency is below this limit. We show that
   for upstream electrons in thermal equilibrium with the acoustic phonons,
   while under supply of hot optical phonons, the conversion efficiency
   increases significantly, making integration of the barrier into optical
   phonon emitting circuits and devices very attractive. (C) 2013 AIP

Title = {{Assessment of mesoscopic particle-based methods in microfluidic
   geometries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{We assess the accuracy and efficiency of two particle-based mesoscopic
   simulation methods, namely, Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) and
   Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRD) for predicting a complex flow in a
   microfluidic geometry. Since both DPD and SRD use soft or weakly
   interacting particles to carry momentum, both methods contain
   unavoidable inertial effects and unphysically high fluid
   compressibility. To assess these effects, we compare the predictions of
   DPD and SRD for both an exact Stokes-flow solution and nearly exact
   solutions at finite Reynolds numbers from the finite element method for
   flow in a straight channel with periodic slip boundary conditions. This
   flow represents a periodic electro-osmotic flow, which is a complex flow
   with an analytical solution for zero Reynolds number. We find that SRD
   is roughly ten-fold faster than DPD in predicting the flow field, with
   better accuracy at low Reynolds numbers. However, SRD has more severe
   problems with compressibility effects than does DPD, which limits the
   Reynolds numbers attainable in SRD to around 25-50, while DPD can
   achieve Re higher than this before compressibility effects become too
   large. However, since the SRD method runs much faster than DPD does, we
   can afford to enlarge the number of grid cells in SRD to reduce the
   fluid compressibility at high Reynolds number. Our simulations provide a
   method to estimate the range of conditions for which SRD or DPD is
   preferable for mesoscopic simulations. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Two Independent Contributions to Step Variability during Over-Ground
   Human Walking}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Human walking exhibits small variations in both step length and step
   width, some of which may be related to active balance control. Lateral
   balance is thought to require integrative sensorimotor control through
   adjustment of step width rather than length, contributing to greater
   variability in step width. Here we propose that step length variations
   are largely explained by the typical human preference for step length to
   increase with walking speed, which itself normally exhibits some slow
   and spontaneous fluctuation. In contrast, step width variations should
   have little relation to speed if they are produced more for lateral
   balance. As a test, we examined hundreds of overground walking steps by
   healthy young adults (N = 14, age < 40 yrs.). We found that slow
   fluctuations in self-selected walking speed (2.3\% coefficient of
   variation) could explain most of the variance in step length (59\%, P <
   0.01). The residual variability not explained by speed was small (1.5\%
   coefficient of variation), suggesting that step length is actually quite
   precise if not for the slow speed fluctuations. Step width varied over
   faster time scales and was independent of speed fluctuations, with
   variance 4.3 times greater than that for step length (P < 0.01) after
   accounting for the speed effect. That difference was further magnified
   by walking with eyes closed, which appears detrimental to control of
   lateral balance. Humans appear to modulate fore-aft foot placement in
   precise accordance with slow fluctuations in walking speed, whereas the
   variability of lateral foot placement appears more closely related to
   balance. Step variability is separable in both direction and time scale
   into balance-and speed-related components. The separation of factors not
   related to balance may reveal which aspects of walking are most critical
   for the nervous system to control.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their high surface areas, crystallinity, and tunable
   properties, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted intense
   interest as next-generation materials for gas capture and storage. While
   much effort has been devoted to the discovery of new MOFs, a vast
   catalog of existing MOFs resides within the Cambridge Structural
   Database (CSD), many of whose gas uptake properties have not been
   assessed. Here we employ data mining and automated structure analysis to
   identify, ``cleanup,{''} and rapidly predict the hydrogen storage
   properties of these compounds. Approximately 20 000 candidate compounds
   were generated from the CSD using an algorithm that removes
   solvent/guest molecules. These compounds were then characterized with
   respect to their surface area and porosity. Employing the empirical
   relationship between excess H-2 uptake and surface area, we predict the
   theoretical total hydrogen storage capacity for the subset of similar to
   4000 compounds exhibiting nontrivial internal porosity. Our screening
   identifies several overlooked compounds having high theoretical
   capacities; these compounds are suggested as targets of opportunity for
   additional experimental characterization. More importantly, screening
   reveals that the relationship between gravimetric and volumetric H-2
   density is concave downward, with maximal volumetric performance
   occurring for surface areas of 3100-4800 m(2)/g. We conclude that H-2
   storage in MOFs will not benefit from further improvements in surface
   area alone. Rather, discovery efforts should aim to achieve moderate
   mass densities and surface areas simultaneously, while ensuring
   framework stability upon solvent removal.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the response of multi-layer epitaxial graphene and
   chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown single-layer graphene to strong
   terahertz (THz) fields. Contrary to theoretical predictions of strong
   nonlinear response, the transmitted fields exhibit no harmonic
   generation, indicating that the nonlinear response is limited by fast
   electron thermalization due to carrier-carrier scattering. The fast
   electron heating gives rise to large THz transmission enhancement
   (>15\%) in single-layer CVD graphene at high THz fields (E-THz > 10 kV
   cm(-1)). The nonlinear effects exhibit non-Drude behavior in the THz
   conductivity, where THz fields induce extreme non-equilibrium electron
   distributions.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops a new class of gellan gum-based tissue-mimicking
   phantom material and a model to predict and control the elastic modulus,
   thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity by adjusting the mass
   fractions of gellan gum, propylene glycol, and sodium chloride,
   respectively. One of the advantages of gellan gum is its gelling
   efficiency allowing highly regulable mechanical properties (elastic
   modulus, toughness, etc). An experiment was performed on 16 gellan
   gum-based tissue-mimicking phantoms and a regression model was fit to
   quantitatively predict three material properties (elastic modulus,
   thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity) based on the phantom
   material's composition. Based on these material properties and the
   regression model developed, tissue-mimicking phantoms of porcine spinal
   cord and liver were formulated. These gellan gum tissue-mimicking
   phantoms have the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties
   approximately equivalent to those of the spinal cord and the liver.}},

Title = {{Greenhouse Gas Implications of Fleet Electrification Based on Big
   Data-Informed Individual Travel Patterns}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{9035-9043}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Environmental implications of fleet electrification highly depend on the
   adoption and utilization of electric vehicles at the individual level.
   Past research has been constrained by using aggregated data to assume
   all vehicles with the same travel pattern as the aggregated average.
   This neglects the inherent heterogeneity of individual travel behaviors
   and may lead to unrealistic estimation of environmental impacts of fleet
   electrification. Using ``big data{''} mining techniques, this research
   examines real-time vehicle trajectory data for 10,375 taxis in Beijing
   in one week to characterize the travel patterns of individual taxis. We
   then evaluate the impact of adopting plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
   (PHEV) in the taxi fleet on life cycle greenhouse gas emissions based on
   the characterized individual travel patterns. The results indicate that
   1) the largest gasoline displacement (1.1 million gallons per year) can
   be achieved by adopting PHEVs with modest electric range (approximately
   80 miles) with current battery cost, limited public charging
   infrastructure, and no government subsidy; 2) reducing battery cost has
   the largest impact on increasing the electrification rate of vehicle
   mileage traveled (VMT), thus increasing gasoline displacement, followed
   by diversified charging opportunities; 3) government subsidies can be
   more effective to increase the VMT electrification rate and gasoline
   displacement if targeted to PHEVs with modest electric ranges (80 to 120
   miles); and 4) while taxi fleet electrification can increase greenhouse
   gas emissions by up to 115 kiloton CO2-eq per year with the current grid
   in Beijing, emission reduction of up to 36.5 kiloton CO2-eq per year can
   be achieved if the fuel cycle emission factor of electricity can be
   reduced to 168.7 g/km. Although the results are based on a specific
   public fleet, this study demonstrates the benefit of using large-scale
   individual-based trajectory data (big data) to better understand
   environmental implications of fleet electrification and inform better
   decision making.}},

Title = {{Catalytic and Photocatalytic Transformations on Metal Nanoparticles with
   Targeted Geometric and Plasmonic Properties}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous catalysis by metals was among the first enabling
   technologies that extensively relied on nanoscience. The early
   intersections of catalysis and nanoscience focused on the synthesis of
   catalytic materials with high surface to volume ratio. These synthesis
   strategies mainly involved the impregnation of metal salts on high
   surface area supports. This would usually yield quasi-spherical
   nanoparticles capped by low-energy surface facets, typically with
   closely packed metal atoms. These high density areas often function as
   the catalytically active surface sites. Unfortunately, strategies to
   control the functioning surface facet (i.e., the geometry of active
   sites that performs catalytic turnover) are rare and represent a
   significant challenge in our ability to fine-tune and optimize the
   reactive surfaces.
   Through recent developments in colloidal chemistry, chemists have been
   able to synthesize metallic nanoparticles of both targeted size and
   desired shape. This has opened new possibilities for the design of
   heterogeneous catalytic materials, since metal nanoparticles of
   different shapes are terminated with different surface facets. By
   controlling the surface facet exposed to reactants, we can start
   affecting the chemical transformations taking place on the metal
   particles and changing the outcome of catalytic processes.
   Controlling the size and shape of metal nanoparticles also allows us to
   control the optical properties of these materials. For example, noble
   metals nanoparticles (Au, Ag, Cu) interact with UV-vis light through an
   excitation of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which is
   highly sensitive to the size and shape of the nanostructures. This
   excitation is accompanied by the creation of short-lived energetic
   electrons on the surface of the nanostructure. We showed recently that
   these energetic electrons could drive photocatalytic transformations on
   these nanostructures. The photocatalytic, electron-driven processes on
   metal nanoparticles represent a new family of chemical transformations
   exhibiting fundamentally different behavior compared with phonon-driven
   thermal processes, potentially allowing selective bond activation. In
   this Account, we discuss both the impact of the shape of metal
   nanoparticles on the outcome of heterogeneous catalytic reactions and
   the direct, electron-driven photocatalysis on plasmonic metal
   nanostructures of noble metals. These two phenomena are important
   examples of taking advantage of physical properties of metal materials
   that are controlled at nanoscales to affect chemical transformations.}},

Abstract = {{The report describes the synthesis of degradable, pH-sensitive,
   membrane-destabilizing, star-shaped polymers where copolymers of
   hydrophobic hexyl methacrylate (HMA) and 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl
   methacrylate (DMAEMA) monomers are grafted from the secondary face of a
   beta-cyclodextrin (-CD) core via acid-labile hydrazone linkages using
   atom transfer radical polymerization. The effect of the graft's
   molecular weight, HMA/DMAEMA molar ratio, and the fraction of DMAEMA
   converted to cationic N,N,N-trimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (TMAEMA)
   monomers on polymer's transfection capacity is systematically
   investigated. Results show that all star-shaped polymers condense
   anti-GAPDH silencing RNA (siRNA) into nanosized particles at +/- ratio
   4:1. Star polymers with shorter (25kDa) P(HMA-co-DMAEMA-co-TMAEMA)
   grafts are more efficient and less cytotoxic than carriers with longer
   (40kDa) grafts. The results show that increasing the ratio of
   hydrophobic HMA monomers in graft's composition higher than 50 mole\%
   dramatically reduces polymer's aqueous solubility and abolishes their
   transfection capacity. Further, retention of DMAEMA monomers in graft's
   composition provide a buffering capacity that enhanced the endosomal
   escape and transfection capacity of the polymers. These systematic
   studies show that -CD-P(HMA-co-DMAEMA-co-TMAEMA)(4.8) polymer with a 25
   kDa average graft's molecular weight and a 50/25/25 ratio of
   HMA/DMAEMA/TMAEMA monomers is the most efficient carrier in delivering
   the siRNA cargo into the cytoplasm of epithelial cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{A clear understanding of the origin of magnetism in metal organic
   frameworks (MOFs) would provide useful insight for tuning the

   paramagnetic metal sites in three-dimensional porous magnets M-MOF-74 (M

   Co-MOF-74 exhibit ferromagnetic (FM) features and significantly distinct
   energy gaps between spin-up and spin-down channels in metastable states.
   After replacement of the Co center with a Ni ion, the FM feature was
   exhibited for the stable state since the ``extra{''} valence electron
   was filled in the spin-down 3d bands to shift the Fermi level to higher
   energy. In contrast, after removal of one valence electron (i.e.,
   replacement of the Fe center with Mn atoms), the energy gap was
   significantly enlarged and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) feature will be

Title = {{Including fluid shear viscosity in a structural acoustic finite element
   model using a scalar fluid representation}},

Abstract = {{An approximate boundary condition is developed in this paper to model
   fluid shear viscosity at boundaries of coupled fluid-structure system.
   The effect of shear viscosity is approximated by a correction term to
   the inviscid boundary condition, written in terms of second order
   in-plane derivatives of pressure. Both thin and thick viscous boundary
   layer approximations are formulated; the latter subsumes the former.
   These approximations are used to develop a variational formation, upon
   which a viscous finite element method (FEM) model is based, requiring
   only minor modifications to the boundary integral contributions of an
   existing inviscid FEM model. Since this FEM formulation has only one
   degree of freedom for pressure, it holds a great computational advantage
   over the conventional viscous FEM formulation which requires
   discretization of the full set of linearized Navier-Stokes equations.
   The results from thick viscous boundary layer approximation are found to
   be in good agreement with the prediction from a Navier-Stokes model.
   When applicable, thin viscous boundary layer approximation also gives
   accurate results with computational simplicity compared to the thick
   boundary layer formulation. Direct comparison of simulation results
   using the boundary layer approximations and a full, linearized
   Navier-Stokes model are made and used to evaluate the accuracy of the
   approximate technique. Guidelines are given for the parameter ranges
   over which the accurate application of the thick and thin boundary
   approximations can be used for a fluid-structure interaction problem.

   Continuous-Feed Convective Assembly of Catalyst Particles}},
Journal = {{SMALL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{2564-2575}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{The widespread potential application of vertically aligned carbon
   nanotube (CNT) forests have stimulated recent work on large-area
   chemical vapor deposition growth methods, but improved control of the
   catalyst particles is needed to overcome limitations to the
   monodispersity and packing density of the CNTs. In particular,
   traditional thin-film deposition methods are not ideal due to their
   vacuum requirements, and due to limitations in particle uniformity and
   density imposed by the thin-film dewetting process. Here, a
   continuous-feed convective self-assembly process for manufacturing
   uniform mono- and multi-layers of catalyst particles for CNT growth is
   presented. Particles are deposited from a solution of commercially
   available iron oxide nanoparticles, by pinning the meniscus between a
   blade edge and the substrate. The substrate is translated at constant
   velocity under the blade so the meniscus and contact angle remain fixed
   as the particles are deposited on the substrate. Based on design of the
   particle solution and tuning of the assembly parameters, a priori
   control of CNT diameter and packing density is demonstrated.
   Quantitative relationships are established between the catalyst size and
   density, and the CNT morphology and density. The roll-to-roll
   compatibility of this method, along with initial results achieved on
   copper foils, suggest promise for scale-up of CNT forest manufacturing
   at commercially relevant throughput.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the origins of ion irradiation-induced nanoparticle
   (NP) motion. Focused-ion-beam irradiation of GaAs surfaces induces
   random walks of Ga NPs, which are biased in the direction opposite to

   constant, the NP drift velocities are dependent on the off-normal
   irradiation angle, likely due to a difference in surface
   non-stoichiometry induced by the irradiation angle dependence of the
   sputtering yield. It is hypothesized that the random walks are initiated

Title = {{Comments on proper (and improper) solutions of bioenergetic equations
   for modeling fish growth}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{404}},
Pages = {{41-46}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates that conventional bioenergetic models, that are
   commonly used to simulate fish growth or consumption, violate basic
   requirements of energy conservation when improperly applied for cases
   where the energy density of the fish is either a function of fish wet
   weight or an independent function of time. It appears that many
   previously published modeling results suffer from this deficiency unless
   the authors have made perspicuous provisions to avoid implicit
   imbalances that occur in the equations under these conditions. The
   incorrect solutions tend to overestimate fish growth and net energy
   consumption. The magnitude of these errors is a function of how rapidly
   the fish energy density changes as the fish increases in size. The
   errors can be as much as 30\% for small fish in the range of 1 to 5 g
   per individual where the energy density changes rapidly. Although this
   mathematical error does not occur if fish energy density is modeled as a
   constant, this assumption is probably inadequate for most applications
   and results in a substantial ``biological error.{''} It is recommended
   that published results for these various cases be critically reviewed
   and corrected where warranted. The errors can be readily eliminated when
   the bioenergetic model equations are handled properly as demonstrated in
   this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

   activities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although significant progress has been achieved in
   developing sensory augmentation methods to improve standing balance,
   attempts to extend this research to locomotion have been quite limited
   in scope. The goal of this study was to characterize the effects of two
   real-time feedback displays on locomotor performance during four
   gait-based tasks ranging in difficulty.
   Methods: Seven subjects with vestibular deficits used a trunk-based
   vibrotactile feedback system that provided real-time feedback regarding
   their medial-lateral (M/L) trunk tilt when they exceeded a
   subject-specific predefined tilt threshold during slow and self-paced
   walking, walking along a narrow walkway, and walking on a foam surface.
   Two feedback display configurations were evaluated: the continuous
   display provided real-time continuous feedback of trunk tilt, and the
   gated display provided feedback for 200 ms during the period immediately
   following heel strike. The root-mean-square (RMS) trunk tilt and
   percentage of time below the tilt thresholds were calculated for all
   locomotor tasks.
   Results: Use of continuous feedback resulted in significant decreases in
   M/L trunk tilt and increases in percentage times below the tilt
   thresholds during narrow and foam trials. The gated display produced
   generally smaller changes.
   Conclusions: This preliminary study demonstrated that use of continuous
   vibrotactile feedback during challenging locomotor tasks allowed
   subjects with vestibular deficits to significantly decrease M/L RMS
   trunk tilt. Analysis of the results also showed that continuous feedback
   was superior.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{We report a comprehensive scaling law and novel lift generation
   mechanisms relevant to the aerodynamic functions of structural
   flexibility in insect flight. Using a Navier-Stokes equation solver,
   fully coupled to a structural dynamics solver, we consider the hovering
   motion of a wing of insect size, in which the dynamics of
   fluid-structure interaction leads to passive wing rotation. Lift
   generated on the flexible wing scales with the relative shape
   deformation parameter, whereas the optimal lift is obtained when the
   wing deformation synchronizes with the imposed translation, consistent
   with previously reported observations for fruit flies and honeybees.
   Systematic comparisons with rigid wings illustrate that the nonlinear
   response in wing motion results in a greater peak angle compared with a
   simple harmonic motion, yielding higher lift. Moreover, the compliant
   wing streamlines its shape via camber deformation to mitigate the
   nonlinear lift-degrading wing-wake interaction to further enhance lift.
   These bioinspired aeroelastic mechanisms can be used in the development
   of flapping wing micro-robots.}},

Abstract = {{We perform an experimental and computational study of the effects of
   external stress and intermixing on single site-selected InAs/InP quantum
   dots in a highly scalable stress-sensitive environment. While such
   effects are well known for their ability to tune emission spectra,
   little is known on how they influence emission shell spacing,
   electron-hole effective mass renormalization, and the physical size of
   the embedded quantum dot, which are all important parameters affecting
   the intended functionality. We show excellent agreement between
   experiment and finite-element solutions of the coupled Navier and
   Schrodinger equations, including recent atomistic pseudopotential
   calculations in the literature. These results indicate that using single
   self-assembled quantum dots in highly scalable, stress-sensitive
   settings as active elements in future bottom-up nanosystems offers
   greater versatility to not only quantum information systems where they
   serve as scalable single-photon sources but also to ultra-sensing
   capabilities in future nanoelectro-mechanical architectures. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The epoxyimidazole resin system is used to form the anisotropic
   conducting film. The latent character of the system is very significant.
   In this study, imidazole (Im) or 2-methylimidazole (2MI) was

   epoxy resin. Polycaprolactone was used as a wall material, and the
   solvent evaporation method was used to form the microcapsule using W/O/W
   emulsion. The shelf life of the microcapsules was studied for the epoxy
   resin, and the curing behavior of the microcapsules for epoxy resin was
   examined using a differential scanning calorimeter. The curing times at
   150 and 180 degrees C were estimated using an indentation method. The
   microcapsules of Im or 2MI exhibited a long shelf life for epoxy resin.
   When comparing the results of the previous methods with the results of
   this study using the W/O/W emulsion, finer microcapsules were formed and
   the microcapsule has longer shelf life. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {{Combinations of cockpit display features may lead to increased pilot
   perceptions of clutter. This research sought to capture pilot
   perceptions of display clutter associated with primary flight display
   features during a vertical takeoff and landing scenario and to validate
   a multidimensional measure of clutter previously developed for a
   fixed-wing environment. Sixteen active fixed-wing pilots were recruited
   for the study that used a simulator configured as a vertical takeoff and
   landing aircraft. A factor analysis was used to reduce the number of
   subdimensions of the clutter measure based on previous ratings data. The
   simplified measure revealed an increase in the number of active display
   features to cause an increase in perceived clutter. Displays including
   synthetic vision system features were perceived as significantly more
   cluttered than those without. Although a tunnel (highway in the sky)
   feature also contributed to clutter, pilots achieved higher navigation
   system failure detection rates when the feature was active. Significant
   positive correlations were found between perceived clutter and visual
   display properties but not between perceived clutter and performance.
   Although pilots rated some displays as being highly cluttered, the
   increased information aided navigation failure detection. Overall, the
   clutter measure was found to have validity and sensitivity for
   application across diverse flight domains.}},

Abstract = {{We have prepared composites with anisotropic microstructure consisting
   of silver nanoparticles and zinc oxide pillars using an oblique angle
   deposition technique, and examined the optical response originating from
   their anisotropic morphology. The sample was obtained in three steps.
   First, the assembly of silver nanoparticles was prepared on a silica
   glass substrate by electron-beam deposition of the silver thin film and
   subsequent heat treatment. Next, zinc oxide was obliquely grown by using
   a pulsed laser deposition. Finally the zinc oxide was crystallized by
   the post annealing to make an array of inclined pillars grown on the top
   of the silver nanoparticles. The structure and morphology of the
   composites were elucidated by a combination of X-ray diffraction
   analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Optical rotation
   spectroscopy clarifies that the composite shows optical birefringence
   due to its inclined pillar morphology. The optical rotation spectrum
   exhibits two peaks, one being associated to the localized surface
   plasmon resonance of the silver nanoparticles and the other the excitons
   in the zinc oxide pillars. The present fabrication method is simple and
   can be applied to obtain anisotropic composites with relatively large
   dimensions. (C)2013 The Ceramic Society of Japan. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Uninjured peripheral nerves in upper-limb amputees represent
   attractive sites for connectivity with neuroprostheses because their
   predictable internal topography allows for precise sorting of motor and
   sensory signals. The inclusion of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
   reduces impedance and improves charge transfer at the biotic-abiotic
   interface. This study evaluates the in vivo performance of
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated interpositional decellularized
   nerve grafts across a critical nerve conduction gap, and examines the
   long-term effects of two different poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
   formulations on regenerating peripheral nerve fibers.
   Methods: In 48 rats, a 15-mm gap in the common peroneal nerve was
   repaired using a nerve graft of equivalent length, including (1)
   decellularized nerve chemically polymerized with
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (dry); (2) decellularized nerve
   electrochemically polymerized with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
   (wet); (3) intact nerve; (4) autogenous nerve graft; (5) decellularized
   nerve alone; and (6) unrepaired nerve gap controls. All groups underwent
   electrophysiologic characterization at 3 months, and nerves were
   harvested for histomorphometric analysis.
   Results: Conduction velocity was significantly faster in the dry
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) group compared with the sham,
   decellularized nerve, and wet poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) groups.
   Maximum specific force for the dry poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
   group was more similar to sham than were decellularized nerve controls.
   Evident neural regeneration was demonstrated in both dry and wet
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) groups by the presence of normal
   regenerating axons on histologic cross-section.
   Conclusions: Both poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) formulations were
   compatible with peripheral nerve regeneration at 3 months. This study
   supports poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) as a promising adjunct for
   peripheral nerve interfaces for prosthetic control and other biomedical
   applications because of its recognized ionic-to-electronic coupling
   potential.}},

Abstract = {{For complex dynamic systems, a modular control design process is often
   employed, wherein the overall design is partitioned into smaller
   modules. This paper considers a particular inner-loop/outer-loop modular
   control strategy in which the designer of the outer-loop module does not
   know the specifics of the inner loop but instead possesses a reference
   model that captures the ideal inner-loop input-output behavior. In the
   first part of this paper, we establish analytical properties of the
   modular reference-model-based design. In the second part, we introduce a
   novel mechanism, referred to as the modular control error compensation,
   which mitigates the performance loss that arises when the inner-loop
   reference model is not matched. We propose an iterative algorithm, using
   synthesis, to design this compensator to reduce performance loss on the
   basis of two concrete worst-case performance metrics. The effectiveness
   of the modular control strategy with the modular control error
   compensation is demonstrated through experimental results on an
   automotive system. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Supporting Interruption Management and Multimodal Interface Design:
   Three Meta-Analyses of Task Performance as a Function of Interrupting
   Task Modality}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to integrate empirical data showing
   the effects of interrupting task modality on the performance of an
   ongoing visual-manual task and the interrupting task itself. The goal is
   to support interruption management and the design of multimodal
   interfaces.
   Background: Multimodal interfaces have been proposed as a promising
   means to support interruption management. To ensure the effectiveness of
   this approach, their design needs to be based on an analysis of
   empirical data concerning the effectiveness of individual and redundant
   channels of information presentation.
   Method: Three meta-analyses were conducted to contrast performance on an
   ongoing visual task and interrupting tasks as a function of interrupting
   task modality (auditory vs. tactile, auditory vs. visual, and single
   modality vs. redundant auditory-visual). In total, 68 studies were
   included and six moderator variables were considered.
   Results: The main findings from the meta-analyses are that response
   times are faster for tactile interrupting tasks in case of low-urgency
   messages. Accuracy is higher with tactile interrupting tasks for
   low-complexity signals but higher with auditory interrupting tasks for
   high-complexity signals. Redundant auditory-visual combinations are
   preferable for communication tasks during high workload and with a small
   visual angle of separation.
   Conclusion: The three meta-analyses contribute to the knowledge base in
   multimodal information processing and design. They highlight the
   importance of moderator variables in predicting the effects of
   interruption task modality on ongoing and interrupting task performance.
   Applications: The findings from this research will help inform the
   design of multimodal interfaces in data-rich, event-driven domains.}},

Title = {{Effects of Anti-Fatigue Mats on Perceived Discomfort and Weight-Shifting
   During Prolonged Standing}},
Journal = {{HUMAN FACTORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{764-775}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of
   anti-fatigue mats on perceived discomfort and behavioral responses
   (weight-shifting between the feet) during prolonged standing.
   Background: Prolonged standing is a common requirement in the workplace
   and is a well-known cause of discomfort. Anti-fatigue mats have been
   shown to reduce discomfort resulting from standing, but no study has
   identified a particular mat that performs better than others or examined
   the relationship between discomfort and weight-shifting.
   Methods: Participants stood for 4 hours on four commercially available
   anti-fatigue mats and a hard surface (control condition). Subjective
   ratings of discomfort were measured, and in-shoe pressure was recorded
   and used to evaluate weight-shifting during standing.
   Results: Compared to the control condition, after 4 hours of standing
   discomfort was reduced by three of the four mats, but discomfort ratings
   did not significantly differ among mats. However, significant
   differences among mats were found in the frequency of weight-shifting,
   and weight-shifting was positively correlated to discomfort.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that subjective reports of discomfort
   were not sufficiently sensitive to detect differences among mats for the
   experimental conditions tested. Behavioral responses, specifically
   weight-shifting between feet, may provide a more sensitive alternative
   to subjective reports.}},

Title = {{HCCI Operability Limits: The Impact of Refinery Stream Gasoline Property
   Variation}},

   ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},

Abstract = {{Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion is highly
   dependent on in-cylinder thermal conditions favorable to autoignition,
   for a given fuel. Fuels available at the pump can differ considerably in
   composition and autoignition chemistry; hence strategies intended to
   bring HCCI to market must account for the fuel variability. To this end,
   a test matrix consisting of eight gasoline fuels composed of blends made
   solely from refinery streams was investigated in an experimental, single
   cylinder HCCI engine. The base compositions were largely representative
   of gasoline one would expect to find across the United States, although
   some of the fuels had slightly lower average octane values than the ASTM
   minimum specification of 87. All fuels had 10\% ethanol by volume
   included in the blend. The properties of the fuels were varied according
   to research octane number (RON), sensitivity (S=RON-MON) and the
   volumetric fractions of aromatics and olefins. For each fuel, a sweep of
   the fuelling was carried out at each speed from the level of instability
   to excessive ringing to determine the limits of HCCI operation. This was
   repeated for a range of speeds to determine the overall operability
   zone. The fuels were kept at a constant intake air temperature during
   these tests. The variation of fuel properties brought about changes in
   the overall operating range of each fuel, as some fuels had more
   favorable low load limits, whereas others enabled more benefit at the
   high load limit. The extent to which the combustion event changed from
   the low load limit to the high load limit was examined as well, to
   provide a relative criterion indicating the sensitivity of HCCI range to
   particular fuel properties.}},

Title = {{Maximizing Design Confidence in Sequential Simulation-Based Optimization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Computational simulation models support a rapid design process. Given
   model approximation and operating conditions uncertainty, designers must
   have confidence that the designs obtained using simulations will perform
   as expected. The traditional approach to address this need consists of
   model validation efforts conducted predominantly prior to the
   optimization process. We argue that model validation is too daunting of
   a task to be conducted with meaningful success for design optimization
   problems associated with high-dimensional space and parameter spaces. In
   contrast, we propose a methodology for maximizing confidence in designs
   generated during the simulation-based optimization process.
   Specifically, we adopt a trust-region-like sequential optimization
   process and utilize a Bayesian hypothesis testing technique to quantify
   model confidence, which we maximize by calibrating the simulation model
   within local domains if and when necessary. This ensures that the design
   iterates generated during the sequential optimization process are
   associated with maximized confidence in the utilized simulation model.
   The proposed methodology is illustrated using a cantilever beam design
   subject to vibration.}},

Abstract = {{Decreasing product life cycles and reduced product development times
   have led to a need for new strategies for coping with the rapid rate of
   product family design changes. In this paper, assembly system
   reconfiguration planning (ASRP) is introduced as a method for cost
   effectively designing several generations of assembly systems in order
   to produce a product family that gradually evolves over time. In the
   ASRP approach, the possible assembly systems for each generation are
   first considered and then the sequence of assembly system configurations
   that minimize the life cycle cost of the process are selected. A
   nonlinear integer optimization formulation is developed for finding the
   cost minimizing assembly system reconfiguration plan using the ASRP
   approach. Dynamic programming and genetic algorithm are used to solve
   the optimization problem. Simulation results indicate that the ASRP
   approach leads to the minimum life cycle costs of the assembly system,
   and the relative cost of reconfiguration and production have an impact
   on the assembly system reconfiguration plan selected. Comparison of the
   results of the dynamic program and genetic algorithm indicate that the
   dynamic program is more computationally efficient for small problems and

Abstract = {{Sustainable manufacturing requires simultaneous consideration of
   economic, environmental, and social implications associated with the
   production and delivery of goods. Fundamentally, sustainable
   manufacturing relies on descriptive metrics, advanced decision-making,
   and public policy for implementation, evaluation, and feedback. In this
   paper, recent research into concepts, methods, and tools for sustainable
   manufacturing is explored. At the manufacturing process level,
   engineering research has addressed issues related to planning,
   development, analysis, and improvement of processes. At a manufacturing
   systems level, engineering research has addressed challenges relating to
   facility operation, production planning and scheduling, and supply chain
   design. Though economically vital, manufacturing processes and systems
   have retained the negative image of being inefficient, polluting, and
   dangerous. Industrial and academic researchers are re-imagining
   manufacturing as a source of innovation to meet society's future needs
   by undertaking strategic activities focused on sustainable processes and
   systems. Despite recent developments in decision making and process-and
   systems-level research, many challenges and opportunities remain.
   Several of these challenges relevant to manufacturing process and system
   research, development, implementation, and education are highlighted.}},

   capable of capturing the surface shape on a machined part that is beyond
   the capability of measurement systems employed in manufacturing plants
   today. Such surface shapes can precisely reflect the impact of cutting
   processes on surface quality. Understanding the cutting processes and
   the resultant surface shape is vital to high-precision machining process
   monitoring and control. This paper presents modeling and experiments of
   a face milling process to extract surface patterns from measured HDM
   data and correlate these patterns with cutting force variation. A
   relationship is established between the instantaneous cutting forces and
   the observed dominant surface patterns along the feed and
   circumferential directions for face milling. Potential applications of
   this relationship in process monitoring, diagnosis, and control are also
   discussed for face milling. Finally a systematic methodology for
   characterizing cutting force induced surface variations for a generic
   machining process is presented by integrating cutting force modeling and
   HDM measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A new engineering-driven factor analysis (EDFA) method has been
   developed to assist the variation source identification for multistage
   manufacturing processes (MMPs). The proposed method investigated how to
   fully utilize qualitative engineering knowledge of the spatial variation
   patterns to guide the factor rotation. It is shown that ideal
   identification can be achieved by matching the rotated factor loading
   vectors with the qualitative indicator vectors (IV) that are defined
   according to spatial variation patterns based on the design constraints.
   However, the random sampling variability may significantly affect the
   estimation of the rotated factor loading vectors, leading to the
   deviations from their true values. These deviations may change the
   matching results and cause misidentification of the actual variation
   sources. By using implicit differentiation approach, this paper derives
   the asymptotic distribution and the associated variance-covariance
   matrix of the rotated factor loading vectors. Therefore, by considering
   the effect of sample estimation variability, the variation sources
   identification problem is reformulated as an asymptotic statistical test
   of the hypothesized match between the rotated factor loading vectors and
   the indicator vectors. A real-world case study is provided to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed matching method and its
   robustness to the sample uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{The grinding procedure and setup, the cutting edge inclination and rake
   angles of the needle with lancet point (NLP), and the NLP tissue
   insertion force are investigated in this paper. The NLP is the most
   commonly used needle tip geometry. However, there is a lack of research
   on the NLP grinding and cutting edge characteristics. In this study, a
   four-step grinding procedure and a mathematical model to calculate the
   inclination and rake angles along the cutting edge of the NLP are
   developed. Three cases of NLP are defined based on the relative position
   of the lancets. Prototype NLP for each case was produced and analyzed.
   Compared to the regular bias bevel needle, grinding two lancets in NLP
   can increases the inclination angle, particularly at the needle tip.
   Experiments with needle insertion into the porcine liver were conducted
   and results showed that NLP could achieve over 40\% reduction of the
   initial peak needle insertion force compared to that of the regular bias
   bevel needle tip.}},

Abstract = {{Convection from an isolated heat source in a chamber has been previously
   studied numerically, experimentally and analytically. These have not
   covered long time spans for wide ranges of Rayleigh number Ra and
   Prandtl number Pr. Numerical calculations of constant viscosity
   convection partially fill the gap in the ranges Ra = 10(3)-10(6) and Pr
   = 1, 10, 100, 1000 and infinity. Calculations begin with cold fluid
   everywhere and localized hot temperature at the centre of the bottom of
   a square two-dimensional chamber. For Ra > 20 000, temperature increases
   above the hot bottom and forms a rising plume head. The head has small
   internal recirculation and minor outward conduction of heat during
   ascent. The head approaches the top, flattens, splits and the two
   remnants are swept to the sidewalls and diffused away. The maximum
   velocity and the top centre heat flux climb to maxima during head ascent
   and then adjust toward constant values. Two steady cells are separated
   by a vertical thermal conduit. This sequence is followed for every value
   of Pr number, although lower Pr convection lags in time. For Ra < 20 000
   there is no plume head, and no streamfunction and heat flux maxima with
   time. For sufficiently large Ra and all values of Pr, an oscillation
   develops at roughly t = 0.2, with the two cells alternately
   strengthening and weakening. This changes to a steady flow with two
   unequal cells that at roughly t = 0.5 develops a second oscillation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a monolithic pulsed high-voltage (HV) generator
   utilizing a single piezoelectric element (PZT51 disk, 5 mm in diameter
   and 740 mu m thick) with electrodes series-connected via a flexible
   polyimide cable. The design, fabrication, assembly, and testing of the
   HV generator are described. In response to transient mechanical load,
   the HV generator is evaluated within the stress range from 1 to 5MPa,
   and the corresponding peak output voltages vary from 100 to 900 V.
   Performance comparison between single-electrode pair HV generator and
   three-electrode pair device indicates series-connected electrodes on a
   monolithic PZT element greatly boost the output voltage under the same
   mechanical load conditions. In further tests, the generated high-voltage
   pulses exceed 1.35 kV and are successfully used to initiate
   microdischarges on monolithically patterned electrodes across a 75 mu m
   air gap. The measured capacitance of the test HV generator is 25 pF and
   the calculated charge delivered to the terminal electrodes in each
   discharge is 34 nC. The nonlinear piezoelectric property of the PZT51 in
   transient mode is studied. We experimentally obtain a linear increase of
   the effective piezoelectric coefficient as the applied pressure
   increases within the range from 1 to 5MPa. {[}2012-0356]}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Previous reports have indicated that parasite actins are short and
   inherently unstable, despite being required for motility. Here we
   re-examine the polymerization properties of actin in Toxoplasma gondii,
   unexpectedly finding that it exhibits isodesmic polymerization in
   contrast to the conventional nucleation-elongation process of all
   previously studied actins from both eukaryotes and bacteria.
   Polymerization kinetics of actin in T. gondii lacks both a lag phase and
   critical concentration, normally characteristic of actins. Unique among
   actins, the kinetics of assembly can be fit with a single set of rate
   constants for all subunit interactions, without need for separate
   nucleation and elongation rates. This isodesmic model accurately
   predicts the assembly, disassembly and the size distribution of actin
   filaments in T. gondii in vitro, providing a mechanistic explanation for
   actin dynamics in vivo. Our findings expand the repertoire of mechanisms
   by which actin polymerization is governed and offer clues about the
   evolution of self-assembling, stabilized protein polymers.}},

Abstract = {{More than two decades ago, microfluidics began to show its impact in
   biological research. Since then, the field of microfluidics has evolving
   rapidly. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
   Microfluidics holds great promise in cancer diagnosis and also serves as
   an emerging tool for understanding cancer biology. Microfluidics can be
   valuable for cancer investigation due to its high sensitivity, high
   throughput, less material-consumption, low cost, and enhanced
   spatio-temporal control. The physical laws on microscale offer an
   advantage enabling the control of physics, biology, chemistry and
   physiology at cellular level. Furthermore, microfluidic based platforms
   are portable and can be easily designed for point-of-care diagnostics.
   Developing and applying the state of the art microfluidic technologies
   to address the unmet challenges in cancer can expand the horizons of not
   only fundamental biology but also the management of disease and patient
   care. Despite the various microfluidic technologies available in the
   field, few have been tested clinically, which can be attributed to the
   various challenges existing in bridging the gap between the emerging
   technology and real world applications. We present a review of role of
   microlfuidcs in cancer research, including the history, recent advances
   and future directions to explore where the field stand currently in
   addressing complex clinical challenges and future of it. This review
   identifies four critical areas in cancer research, in which
   microfluidics can change the current paradigm. These include cancer cell
   isolation, molecular diagnostics, tumor biology and high-throughput
   screening for therapeutics. In addition, some of our lab's current
   research is presented in the corresponding sections.}},

Abstract = {{Cytosolic nucleases have been proposed to play an important role in
   limiting the effectiveness of polyplex-based gene delivery agents. In
   order to explore the effect of cell membrane disruption on nuclease
   activation, nuclease activity upon polyplex uptake and localization, and
   nuclease activity upon gene expression, we employed an oligonucleotide
   molecular beacon (MB). The MB was incorporated as an integral part of
   the polymer/DNA polyplex, and two-color flow cytometry experiments were
   performed to explore the relationship of MB cleavage with propidium
   iodide (PI) uptake, protein expression, and polyplex uptake. In
   addition, confocal fluorescence microcopy was performed to examine both
   polyplex and cleaved MB localization. The impact of cell membrane
   disruption was also probed using whole-cell patch clamp measurement of
   the plasma membrane's electrical conductance. Differential activation of
   cytosolic nuclease was observed with substantial activity for B-PEI and
   G5 PAMAM dendrimer (G5), less cleavage for jetPEI, and little activity
   for L-PEI. jetPEI and L-PEI exhibited substantially greater transgene
   expression, consistent with the lower amounts of MB oligonucleotide
   cleavage observed. Cytosolic nuclease activity, although dependent on
   the choice of polymer employed, was not related to the degree of cell
   plasma membrane disruption that occurred as measured by PI uptake or
   whole cell patch clamp.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear oscillations following the Rayleigh collapse of a gas bubble
   in a linear viscoelastic (tissue-like) medium}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In a variety of biomedical engineering applications, cavitation occurs
   in soft tissue, a viscoelastic medium. The present objective is to
   understand the basic physics of bubble dynamics in soft tissue. To gain
   insights into this problem, theoretical and numerical models are
   developed to study the Rayleigh collapse and subsequent oscillations of
   a gas bubble in a viscoelastic material. To account for liquid
   compressibility and thus accurately model large-amplitude oscillations,
   the Keller-Miksis equation for spherical bubble dynamics is used. The
   most basic linear viscoelastic model that includes stress relaxation,
   viscosity, and elasticity (Zener, or standard linear solid) is
   considered for soft tissue, thereby adding two ordinary differential
   equations for the stresses. The present study seeks to advance past
   studies on cavitation in tissue by determining the basic effects of
   relaxation and elasticity on the bubble dynamics for situations in which
   compressibility is important. Numerical solutions show a clear
   dependence of the oscillations on the viscoelastic properties and
   compressibility. The perturbation analysis (method of multiple scales)
   accurately predicts the bubble response given the relevant constraints
   and can thus be used to investigate the underlying physics. A
   third-order expansion of the radius is necessary to accurately represent
   the dynamics. Key quantities of interest such as the oscillation
   frequency and damping, minimum radius, and collapse time can be
   predicted theoretically. The damping does not always monotonically
   decrease with decreasing elasticity: there exists a finite non-zero
   elasticity for which the damping is minimum; this value falls within the
   range of reported tissue elasticities. Also, the oscillation period
   generally changes with time over the first few cycles due to the
   nonlinearity of the system, before reaching an equilibrium value. The
   analytical expressions for the key bubble dynamics quantities and
   insights gained from the analysis may prove valuable in the development
   and optimization of certain biomedical applications. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{The dynamics of ions traversing sheaths in low temperature plasmas are
   important to the formation of the ion energy distribution incident onto
   surfaces during microelectronics fabrication. Ion dynamics have been
   measured using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) in the sheath above a 30
   cm diameter, 2.2 MHz-biased silicon wafer in a commercial inductively
   coupled plasma processing reactor. The velocity distribution of argon
   ions was measured at thousands of positions above and radially along the
   surface of the wafer by utilizing a planar laser sheet from a pulsed,
   tunable dye laser. Velocities were measured both parallel and
   perpendicular to the wafer over an energy range of 0.4-600 eV. The
   resulting fluorescence was recorded using a fast CCD camera, which
   provided resolution of 0.4 mm in space and 30 ns in time. Data were
   taken at eight different phases during the 2.2 MHz cycle. The ion
   velocity distributions (IVDs) in the sheath were found to be spatially
   non-uniform near the edge of the wafer and phase-dependent as a function
   of height. Several cm above the wafer the IVD is Maxwellian and
   independent of phase. Experimental results were compared with
   simulations. The experimental time-averaged ion energy distribution
   function as a function of height compare favorably with results from the
   computer model. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Optimal causal control of a wave energy converter in a random sea}},
Journal = {{APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper concerns the design of feedback control systems to maximize
   power generation of a wave energy converter (WEC) in a random sea. In
   the literature on WEC control, most of the proposed feedback controllers
   fall into three categories. Many are static; i.e., they extract power by
   imposing an equivalent damping or resistive load on the power take-off
   (PTO) devices. Others are dynamic and are designed to maximize power
   generation at all frequencies, which results in an anticausal feedback
   law. Other dynamic control design methods are causal, and are tuned to
   achieve the anticausal performance at only a single frequency. By
   contrast, this paper illustrates that the determination of the true
   optimal causal dynamic controller for a WEC can be found as the solution
   to a nonstandard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) optimal control
   problem. The theory assumes that the control system must make power
   generation decisions based only on present and past measurements of the
   generator voltages and/or velocities. It is shown that unlike optimal
   anticausal control, optimal causal control requires knowledge of the
   stationary spectral characteristics of the random sea state.
   Additionally, it is shown that the efficiency of the generator factors
   into the feedback synthesis. The theory is illustrated on a linear
   dynamical model for a buoy-type WEC with significant resonant modes in
   surge and pitch, and equipped with three spatially-distributed
   generators. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Toxic or persistent solvents have been widely used to remove greases and

   significant potential for various degreasing applications. The operation
   time and temperature and flow rate of subcritical water had markedly
   positive impacts on the degreasing efficiency. However, the effect of
   pressure of subcritical water flow was minimal. The degreasing
   efficiency was also highly dependent on the physical characteristics and
   chemical composition of grease. The subcritical water treatment
   demonstrated a better degreasing efficiency than conventional degreasing
   methods. Only minor physical damage was observed on the metal parts
   after the subcritical water treatment. Conclusively, it was found that

Title = {{Limited carry-in technique for real-time multi-core scheduling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{372-375}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Schedulability analysis has been widely studied to provide offline
   timing guarantees for a set of real-time tasks. The so-called limited
   carry-in technique, which can be orthogonally incorporated into many
   different multi-core schedulability analysis methods, was originally
   introduced for Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling to derive a
   tighter bound on the amount of interference of carry-in jobs at the
   expense of investigating a pseudo-polynomial number of intervals. This
   technique has been later adapted for Fixed-Priority (FP) scheduling to
   obtain the carry-in bound efficiently by examining only one interval,
   leading to a significant improvement in multi-core schedulability
   analysis. However, such a successful result has not yet been transferred
   to any other non-FP scheduling algorithms. Motivated by this, this paper
   presents a generic limited carry-in technique that is applicable to any
   work-conserving algorithms. Specifically, this paper derives a carry-in

Abstract = {{Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a proinflammatory cytokine
   that regulates the response of many tissues following injury. Previous
   studies in our lab have shown that treating muscles with TGF-beta
   results in a dramatic accumulation of type I collagen, substantial fiber
   atrophy, and a marked decrease in force production. Because TGF-beta
   promotes atrophy and fibrosis, our objective was to investigate whether
   the inhibition of TGF-beta after injury would enhance the recovery of
   muscle following injury. We hypothesized that inhibiting TGF-beta after
   contraction-induced injury would improve the functional recovery of
   muscles by preventing muscle fiber atrophy and weakness, and by limiting
   the accumulation of fibrotic scar tissue. To test this hypothesis, we
   induced an injury using a series of in situ lengthening contractions to
   extensor digitorum longus muscles of mice treated with either a
   bioneutralizing antibody against TGF-beta or a sham antibody. Compared
   with controls, muscles from mice receiving TGF-beta inhibitor showed a
   greater recovery in force 3 days and 7 days after injury but had a
   decrease in force compared with controls at the 21-day time point. The
   early enhancement in force in the TGF-beta inhibitor group was
   associated with an initial improvement in tissue morphology, but, at 21
   days, while the control group was fully recovered, the TGF-beta
   inhibitor group displayed an irregular extracellular matrix and an
   increase in atrogin-1 gene expression. These results indicate that the
   inhibition of TGF-beta promotes the early recovery of muscle function
   but is detrimental overall to full muscle recovery following moderate to
   severe muscle injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Current ion models in molecular mechanics are simple spheres, and their

   placed in the direction of the coordinating atoms. We have parametrized
   this model for two divalent cations, Ca2+ and Mg2+, and have tested the
   models accuracy in a variety of simulations. With this model we are not
   only able to correctly predict the free energies and selectivity for
   cation binding sites in proteins and nucleic acids, but we achieve
   better coordination geometries and can capture more subtle effects such
   as the exchange of inner shell waters. Additionally, this model does not
   employ higher-order electrostatics and thus can be easily used with

Abstract = {{Diesel exhaust particulate matter contains many semivolatile organic
   compounds (SVOCs) of environmental and health significance. This study
   investigates the composition, emission rates, and measurement integrity
   of 25 SVOCs, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
   nitro-PAHs (NPAHs), and diesel biomarkers hopanes and steranes. Diesel
   engine particulate matter (PM), generated using an engine test bench,
   three engine conditions, and ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD), was
   collected on borosilicate glass fiber filters. Under high engine load,
   the PM emission rate was 0.102 g/kWh, and emission rates of Sigma PAHs
   (10 compounds), Sigma NPAHs (6 compounds), Shopanes (2 compounds), and
   Sigma steranes (2 compounds) were 2.52, 0.351, 0.02-2 and 1 mu g/kWh,
   respectively. Storage losses were evaluated for three cases:
   conditioning filters in clean air at 25 degrees C and 33 \% relative
   humidity (RH) for 24 h, storing filter samples (without extraction)
   wrapped in aluminum foil at 4 degrees C for up to 1 month, and storing
   filter extracts in glass vials capped with Teflon crimp seals at 4
   degrees C for up to 6 months. After conditioning filters for 24 h, 30 \%
   of the more volatile PAHs were lost, but lower volatility NPAHs, hopanes
   and steranes showed negligible changes. Storing wrapped filters and
   extracts at 4 degrees C for up to 1 month did not lead to significant
   losses, but storing extracts for 5 months led to significant losses of
   PAHs and NPAHs; hopanes and steranes demonstrated greater integrity.
   These results suggest that even relatively brief filter conditioning
   periods, needed for gravimetric measurements of PM mass, and extended
   storage of filter extracts, can lead to underestimates of SVOC
   concentrations. Thus, SVOC sampling and analysis protocols should
   utilize stringent criteria and performance checks to identify and limit
   possible biases occurring during filter and extract processing.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Recent studies in epilepsy, cognition, and brain machine
   interfaces have shown the utility of recording intracranial
   electroencephalography (iEEG) with greater spatial resolution. Many of
   these studies utilize microelectrodes connected to specialized
   amplifiers that are optimized for such recordings. We recently measured
   the impedances of several commercial microelectrodes and demonstrated
   that they will distort iEEG signals if connected to clinical EEG
   amplifiers commonly used in most centers. In this study we demonstrate
   the clinical implications of this effect and identify some of the
   potential difficulties in using microelectrodes.
   Methods Human iEEG data were digitally filtered to simulate the signal
   recorded by a hybrid grid (two macroelectrodes and eight
   microelectrodes) connected to a standard EEG amplifier. The filtered
   iEEG data were read by three trained epileptologists, and high frequency
   oscillations (HFOs) were detected with a well-known algorithm. The
   filtering method was verified experimentally by recording an injected
   EEG signal in a saline bath with the same physical acquisition system
   used to generate the model. Several electrodes underwent scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM).
   Key Findings Macroelectrode recordings were unaltered compared to the
   source iEEG signal, but microelectrodes attenuated low frequencies. The
   attenuated signals were difficult to interpret: all three clinicians
   changed their clinical scoring of slowing and seizures when presented
   with the same data recorded on different sized electrodes. The HFO
   detection algorithm was oversensitive with microelectrodes, classifying
   many more HFOs than when the same data were recorded with
   macroelectrodes. In addition, during experimental recordings the
   microelectrodes produced much greater noise as well as large baseline
   fluctuations, creating sharply contoured transients, and superimposed
   false HFOs. SEM of these microelectrodes demonstrated marked variability
   in exposed electrode surface area, lead fractures, and sharp edges.
   Significance Microelectrodes should not be used with low impedance (<1G)
   amplifiers due to severe signal attenuation and variability that changes
   clinical interpretations. The current method of preparing
   microelectrodes can leave sharp edges and nonuniform amounts of exposed
   wire. Even when recorded with higher impedance amplifiers,
   microelectrode data are highly prone to artifacts that are difficult to
   interpret. Great care must be taken when analyzing iEEG from high
   impedance microelectrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction from undersampled k-space
   data requires regularization to reduce noise and aliasing artifacts.
   Proper application of regularization however requires appropriate
   selection of associated regularization parameters. In this work, we
   develop a data-driven regularization parameter adjustment scheme that
   minimizes an estimate {[}based on the principle of Stein's unbiased risk
   estimate (SURE)] of a suitable weighted squared-error measure in
   k-space. To compute this SURE-type estimate, we propose a Monte-Carlo
   scheme that extends our previous approach to inverse problems (e. g.,
   MRI reconstruction) involving complex-valued images. Our approach
   depends only on the output of a given reconstruction algorithm and does
   not require knowledge of its internal workings, so it is capable of
   tackling a wide variety of reconstruction algorithms and nonquadratic
   regularizers including total variation and those based on the l(1)-norm.
   Experiments with simulated and real MR data indicate that the proposed
   approach is capable of providing near mean squared-error optimal
   regularization parameters for single-coil undersampled non-Cartesian MRI
   reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{We report a decentralized extended information filter (DEIF) algorithm
   designed for single-beacon cooperative acoustic navigation of one or
   more client underwater vehicles. In single-beacon cooperative acoustic
   navigation, ranges and state information from a single reference source
   (the server) are used to improve localization and navigation of an
   underwater vehicle (the client). The ranges and state information are
   obtained using underwater acoustic modems and a synchronous-clock
   time-of-flight paradigm. Apart from the server's acoustic data
   broadcasts, the client has no access to the server's position or sensor
   measurements. We show that at the instance of each range measurement
   update, the DEIF algorithm yields identical results for the current
   vehicle state estimate as the corresponding centralized extended
   information filter (CEIF), which fully tracks the joint probability
   distribution between the server and client. We compare the state
   estimation results of the DEIF algorithm with that of a CEIF and three
   other filters reported in the literature. The evaluation is performed
   using both simulated data and an experimental dataset comprised of one
   surface craft and two autonomous underwater vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the ability of human listeners to detect the
   presence and judge the strength of a statistical dependency among the
   elements comprising sequences of sounds. The statistical dependency was
   imposed by specifying transition matrices that determined the likelihood
   of occurrence of the sound elements. Markov chains were constructed from
   these transition matrices having states that were pure tones/noise
   bursts that varied along the stimulus dimensions of frequency and/or
   interaural time difference. Listeners reliably detected the presence of
   a statistical dependency in sequences of sounds varying along these
   stimulus dimensions. Furthermore, listeners were able to discriminate
   the relative strength of the dependency in pairs of successive sound
   sequences. Random variation along an irrelevant stimulus dimension had
   small but significant adverse effects on performance. A much greater
   decrement in performance was found when the sound sequences were
   concurrent. Likelihood ratios were computed based on the transition
   matrices to specify Ideal Observer performance for the experimental
   conditions. Preliminary modeling efforts were made based on degradations
   of Ideal Observer performance intended to represent human observer
   limitations. This experimental approach appears to be useful for
   examining auditory ``stream{''} formation and maintenance over time
   based on the predictability of the constituent sound elements. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We present a survey of atmospheric flow field phenomena models. The

   shear models, such as the Surface, Layer, and Ridge Wind Shear models,
   comparing their characteristics. We also describe and compare thermal
   updraft models, such as the Chimney and the Bubble Thermal models. To
   close, we review different gust models. Throughout this work, we studied
   several existing models, but we also introduce new ones and improved
   versions of existing ones. The Bubble Thermal, Layer Wind Shear, and the
   Ridge Wind Shear models are examples of the new models presented.
   Furthermore, we present the Chimney Thermal model improvements, which
   take into account the phenomenon interaction with the prevailing winds.

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of optimal static sensor selection for
   ensuring diagnosability in labeled bounded and unbounded Petri nets.
   Starting from a non-diagnosable labeled Petri net system, we present a
   systematic procedure to design a new labeling function that makes the
   system diagnosable and optimizes a given objective function. This
   procedure employs a particular net, called Verifier Net, that is built
   from the original Petri net and provides necessary and sufficient
   conditions for diagnosability. We exploit the system structure captured
   in the verifier net to guide the search for the desired new labeling
   function. The search is performed over an unfolding of the
   reachability/coverability tree of the verifier net and follows a set of
   rules that capture the relabeling strategy. We allow for unobservable
   transitions that cannot be labeled as well as for multiple fault
   classes. We formulate an integer linear programming problem that finds
   an optimal labeling function when numerical costs are associated with
   transition relabeling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Laser-generated focused ultrasound (LGFU) is a unique modality that can
   produce single-pulsed cavitation and strong local disturbances on a
   tight focal spot (<100 mu m). We utilize LGFU as a non-contact,
   non-thermal, high-precision tool to fractionate and cleave cell clusters
   cultured on glass substrates. Fractionation processes are investigated
   in detail, which confirms distinct cell behaviors in the focal center
   and the periphery of LGFU spot. For better understanding of local
   disturbances under LGFU, we use a high-speed laser-flash shadowgraphy
   technique and then fully visualize instantaneous microscopic processes
   from the ultrasound wave focusing to the micro-bubble collapse. Based on
   these visual evidences, we discuss possible mechanisms responsible for
   the focal and peripheral disruptions, such as a liquid jet-induced wall
   shear stress and shock emissions due to bubble collapse. The ultrasonic
   micro-fractionation is readily available for in vitro cell patterning
   and harvesting. Moreover, it is significant as a preliminary step
   towards high-precision surgery applications in future. (C) 2013 Optical

Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of an analysis technique and
   software program to quantify the anisotropy of pyrolytic carbon or
   ultra-fine grain graphite using selected area electron diffraction
   (SAED) patterns from a transmission electron microscope. Results serve
   as-input to a computer program that calculates the Bacon anisotropy
   factor (BAF) and orientation parameter (R). This was achieved by
   analyzing the SAED patterns to determine the full width half maximum of
   the two peaks on the (0001) diffraction ring, converting the SAED data
   into the same format as the X-ray data and then calculating the BAF and
   R. The methodology of calculating the BAF and R values from the SAED
   patterns was confirmed by comparing the calculated values with the BAF
   values resulting from ellipsometry measurements on two identical
   isotropic pyrolytic carbon (PyC) samples and resulted in a difference of
   less than 0.26\%, while measurements on an anisotropic turbostratic
   pyrolytic carbon showed almost a 40\% difference which may be due to the
   larger planar spacing changing the extraordinary refractive index and
   extraordinary extinction coefficient. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Spectrum sensing is key to the realization of dynamic spectrum access.
   To protect primary users' communications from the interference caused by
   secondary users, spectrum sensing must meet the strict detectability
   requirements set by regulatory bodies, such as the FCC. Such strict
   detection requirements, however, can hardly be achieved using PHY-layer
   sensing techniques alone with one-time sensing by only a single sensor.
   In this paper, we jointly exploit two MAC-layer sensing
   methods-cooperative sensing and sensing scheduling-to improve spectrum
   sensing performance, while incurring minimum sensing overhead. While
   these sensing methods have been studied individually, little has been
   done on their combinations and the resulting benefits. Specifically, we
   propose to construct a profile of the primary signal's RSSs and design a
   simple, yet near-optimal, incumbent detection rule. Based on this
   constructed RSS profile, we develop an algorithm to find 1) an optimal
   set of sensors; 2) an optimal point at which to stop scheduling
   additional sensing; and 3) an optimal sensing duration for one-time
   sensing, so as to make a tradeoff between detection performance and
   sensing overhead. Our evaluation results show that the proposed sensing
   algorithms reduce the sensing overhead by up to 65 percent, while
   meeting the requirements of both false-alarm and misdetection
   probabilities of less than 0.01.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Conventional dynamic voltage and frequency scaling techniques use high
   CPU utilization as a predictor for user dissatisfaction, to which they
   react by increasing CPU frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate that
   for many interactive applications, perceived performance is highly
   dependent upon the particular user and application, and is not linearly
   related to CPU utilization. This observation reveals an opportunity for
   reducing power consumption. We propose Human and Application driven
   frequency scaling for Processor Power Efficiency (HAPPE), an adaptive
   user-and-application-aware dynamic CPU frequency scaling technique.
   HAPPE continuously adapts processor frequency and voltage to the learned
   performance requirement of the current user and application. Adaptation
   to user requirements is quick and requires minimal effort from the user
   (typically a handful of key strokes). Once the system has adapted to the
   user's performance requirements, the user is not required to provide
   continued feedback but is permitted to provide additional feedback to
   adjust the control policy to changes in preferences. HAPPE was
   implemented on a Linux-based laptop and evaluated in 22 hours of
   controlled user studies. Compared to the default Linux CPU frequency
   controller, HAPPE reduces the measured system-wide power consumption of
   CPU-intensive interactive applications by 25 percent on average while
   maintaining user satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss path planning in a direction-dependent environment
   illustrated by the fastest-path problem with anisotropic speed function.
   The difficulty of optimal-path finding in a direction-dependent medium
   comes from the fact that our travel-time function is asymmetric and, in
   general, violates the triangle inequality. We present an analytical form
   solution for the fastest-path finding problem in an obstacle-free domain
   without making any assumptions on the structure of the speed function.
   Subsequently, we merge these results with visibility graph search
   methods to develop an obstacle-avoiding fastest-path finding algorithm
   for an anisotropic speed function. Optimal routing of a vessel in a
   stationary random seaway is discussed throughout the paper to motivate
   and demonstrate applications of our work.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Downward reaching may lead to falls in older adults, but the
   underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study assessed
   differences between younger and older adults in postural control and
   losses of balance when performing a forward reach to the floor in 2
   possible real-world situations, with and without full foot contact with
   the floor.
   Methods. Healthy younger (n = 13) and older (n = 12) women reached as
   fast as possible to a target placed at their maximal forward reaching
   distance on floor, either standing on their whole foot or on the
   shortest base of support (BOS) that they were willing to perform a toe
   touch with.
   Results. Compared with younger women, older women used a 50\% larger BOS
   when stooping down to touch their toes and had 22\% less maximal forward
   reaching distance on the floor. Older women were twice as likely to lose
   their balance as younger women while performing a rapid forward floor
   reach (chi(2)(2) = 3.9; p < .05; relative risk = 1.91; 95\% CI =
   0.99-3.72). Postural sway, measured as center of pressure excursions and
   center of pressure root mean square error, did not differ between
   younger and older women anteriorly, but posteriorly, older women
   decreased their sway in full foot BOS and increased their sway in
   forefoot BOS (Age x BOS, p < .05). Leg strength was reduced in older
   versus younger women and was correlated with maximal reach distance (r =
   .65-.71).
   Conclusions. Healthy older women performing a rapid maximum forward
   reach on the floor, particularly when using their forefoot for support,
   are at an increased risk for losing their balance.}},

Abstract = {{Research in stretchable conductors is fuelled by diverse technological
   needs. Flexible electronics, neuroprosthetic and cardiostimulating
   implants, soft robotics and other curvilinear systems require materials
   with high conductivity over a tensile strain of 100 per cent (refs 1-3).
   Furthermore, implantable devices or stretchable displays(4) need
   materials with conductivities a thousand times higher while retaining a
   strain of 100 per cent. However, the molecular mechanisms that operate
   during material deformation and stiffening make stretchability and
   conductivity fundamentally difficult properties to combine. The
   macroscale stretching of solids elongates chemical bonds, leading to the
   reduced overlap and delocalization of electronic orbitals(5). This
   conductivity-stretchability dilemma can be exemplified by liquid metals,
   in which conduction pathways are retained on large deformation but weak
   interatomic bonds lead to compromised strength. The best-known
   stretchable conductors use polymer matrices containing percolated
   networks of high-aspect-ratio nanometre-scale tubes or nanowires to
   address this dilemma to some extent(6-11). Further improvements have
   been achieved by using fillers (the conductive component) with increased
   aspect ratio, of all-metallic composition(12), or with specific
   alignment (the way the fillers are arranged in the matrix)(13,14).
   However, the synthesis and separation of high-aspect-ratio fillers is
   challenging, stiffness increases with the volume content of metallic
   filler, and anisotropy increases with alignment(15). Pre-strained
   substrates(16,17), buckled microwires(18) and three-dimensional
   microfluidic polymer networks(19) have also been explored. Here we
   demonstrate stretchable conductors of polyurethane containing spherical
   nanoparticles deposited by either layer-by-layer assembly or
   vacuum-assisted flocculation. High conductivity and stretchability were
   observed in both composites despite the minimal aspect ratio of the
   nanoparticles. These materials also demonstrate the electronic
   tunability of mechanical properties, which arise from the dynamic
   self-organization of the nanoparticles under stress. A modified
   percolation theory incorporating the self-assembly behaviour of
   nanoparticles gave an excellent match with the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) provide message delivery services to
   users via intermittently connected nodes. In DTNs, routing is one of the
   most challenging issues since end-to-end connectivity between nodes may
   not be available most of the time. Although many routing protocols for
   DTNs have been proposed, they do not achieve satisfactory performance,
   since they exploit only some of the network characteristics. In this
   paper, we present a new DTN routing protocol, called the Link Contact
   Duration-based Routing Protocol (LCD). Like existing protocols, LCD uses
   the disconnect duration of a link between two nodes to find the routing
   path with the shortest end-to-end delay. In addition, LCD uses the
   contact duration of a link and the number of buffered messages to
   deliver as many messages as possible in a short time. Our simulation
   results show that LCD has better performance than existing DTN routing
   protocols.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms and efficiency of charge transport in lithium peroxide
   (Li2O2) are key factors in understanding the performance of non-aqueous
   Li-air batteries. Towards revealing these mechanisms, here we use
   first-principles calculations to predict the concentrations and
   mobilities of charge carriers and intrinsic defects in Li2O2 as a
   function of cell voltage. Our calculations reveal that changes in the
   charge state of O-2 dimers controls the defect chemistry and
   conductivity of Li2O2. Negative lithium vacancies (missing Li+) and
   small hole polarons are identified as the dominant charge carriers. The
   electronic conductivity associated with polaron hopping (5 x 10(-20) S
   cm(-1)) is comparable to the ionic conductivity arising from the
   migration of Li-ions (4 x 10(-19) S cm(-1)), suggesting that charge
   transport in Li2O2 occurs through a mixture of ionic and polaronic
   contributions. These data indicate that the bulk regions of crystalline
   Li2O2 are insulating, with appreciable charge transport occurring only
   at moderately high charging potentials that drive partial delithiation.
   The implications of limited charge transport on discharge and recharge
   mechanisms are discussed, and a two-stage charging process linking
   charge transport, discharge product morphology, and overpotentials is
   described. We conclude that achieving both high discharge capacities and
   efficient charging will depend upon access to alternative mechanisms
   that bypass bulk charge transport. More generally, we describe how the
   presence of a species that can change charge state -e.g., O-2 dimers in
   alkaline metal-based peroxides - may impact rechargeability in metal-air
   batteries.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the fundamental problem of generating bipartite classical
   distributions or quantum states. By designing efficient communication
   protocols and proving their optimality, we establish a number of
   intriguing connections to fundamental measures in optimization, convex
   geometry, and information theory. 1) To generate a classical
   distribution P(x, y), we tightly characterize the minimum amount of
   quantum communication needed by the psd-rank of P (as a matrix), a
   measure recently proposed by Fiorini et al. (Proc. 44th ACM Symp. Theory
   Comput., pp. 95-106, 2012) in studies of the minimum size of extended
   formulations of optimization problems such as TSP. This echos the
   previous characterization for the optimal classical communication cost
   by the nonnegative rank of P. The result is obtained via investigating
   the more general case of bipartite quantum state generation and
   designing an optimal protocol for it. 2) When an approximation of
   epsilon is allowed to generate a distribution (X, Y) similar to P, we
   present a classical protocol of the communication cost O((C(X, Y) +
   1)/epsilon), where C(X, Y) is common information, a well-studied measure
   in information theory introduced by Wyner (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 21
   (2): 163-179, 1975). This also links nonnegative rank and common
   information, two seemingly unrelated quantities in different fields. 3)
   For approximately generating a quantum pure state vertical bar psi >, we
   completely characterize the minimum cost by a corresponding approximate
   rank, closing a possibly exponential gap left in Ambainis et al. (SIAM
   J. Comput., 32 (6): 1570-1585, 2003).}},

Abstract = {{Proper orthogonal decomposition has been utilized for well over a decade
   to study turbulence and cyclic variation of flow and combustion
   properties in internal combustion engines. In addition, proper
   orthogonal decomposition is useful to quantitatively compare multi-cycle
   in-cylinder measurements with numerical simulations (large-eddy
   simulations). However, the application can be daunting, and physical
   interpretation of proper orthogonal decomposition can be ambiguous. In
   this paper, the mathematical procedure of proper orthogonal
   decomposition is described conceptually, and a compact MATLAB((R)) code
   is provided. However, the major purpose is to empirically illustrate the
   properties of the proper orthogonal decomposition analysis and to
   propose practical procedures for application to internal combustion
   engine flows. Two measured velocity data sets from a motored internal
   combustion engine are employed, one a highly directed flow (each cycle
   resembles the ensemble average), and the other an undirected flow (no
   cycle resembles the average). These data are used to illustrate the
   degree to which proper orthogonal decomposition can quantitatively
   distinguish between internal combustion engine flows with these two
   extreme flow properties. In each flow, proper orthogonal decomposition
   mode 1 is an excellent estimate of ensemble average, and this study
   illustrates how it is thus possible to unambiguously quantify the cyclic
   variability of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes ensemble average and
   turbulence. In addition, this study demonstrates the benefits of
   comparing two different samples of cycles using a common proper
   orthogonal decomposition mode set derived by combining the two samples,
   the effect of spatial resolution, and a method to evaluate the number of
   snapshots required to achieve convergence.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: High-dose radiation therapy (RT) for intrahepatic cancer is
   limited by the development of liver injury. This study investigated
   whether regional hepatic function assessed before and during the course
   of RT using 99mTc-labeled iminodiacetic acid (IDA) single photon
   emission computed tomography (SPECT) could predict regional liver
   function reserve after RT.
   Methods and Materials: Fourteen patients treated with RT for
   intrahepatic cancers underwent dynamic 99mTc-IDA SPECT scans before RT,
   during, and 1 month after completion of RT. Indocyanine green (ICG)
   tests, a measure of overall liver function, were performed within 1 day
   of each scan. Three-dimensional volumetric hepatic extraction fraction
   (HEF) images of the liver were estimated by deconvolution analysis.
   After coregistration of the CT/SPECT and the treatment planning CT, HEF
   dose-response functions during and after RT were generated. The
   volumetric mean of the HEFs in the whole liver was correlated with ICG
   clearance time. Three models, dose, priori, and adaptive models, were
   developed using multivariate linear regression to assess whether the
   regional HEFs measured before and during RT helped predict regional
   hepatic function after RT.
   Results: The mean of the volumetric liver HEFs was significantly
   correlated with ICG clearance half-life time (r=-0.80, P<.0001), for all
   time points. Linear correlations between local doses and regional HEFs 1
   month after RT were significant in 12 patients. In the priori model,
   regional HEF after RT was predicted by the planned dose and regional HEF
   assessed before RT (R=0.71, P<.0001). In the adaptive model, regional
   HEF after RT was predicted by regional HEF reassessed during RT and the
   remaining planned local dose (R=0.83, P<.0001).
   Conclusions: 99mTc-IDA SPECT obtained during RT could be used to assess
   regional hepatic function and helped predict post-RT regional liver
   function reserve. This could support individualized adaptive radiation
   treatment strategies to maximize tumor control and minimize the risk of
   liver damage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Significant improvements to the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT have
   emerged in recent years, primarily due to the engineering of material
   composition and nanostructure in inorganic semiconductors(1) (ISCs).
   However, many present high-ZT materials are based on low-abundance
   elements that pose challenges for scale-up, as they entail high material
   costs in addition to brittleness and difficulty in large-area
   deposition. Here we demonstrate a strategy to improve ZT in conductive
   polymers and other organic semiconductors (OSCs) for which the base
   elements are earth-abundant. By minimizing total dopant volume, we show
   that all three parameters constituting ZT vary in a manner so that ZT
   increases; this stands in sharp contrast to ISCs, for which these
   parameters have trade-offs. Reducing dopant volume is found to be as
   important as optimizing carrier concentration when maximizing ZT in
   OSCs. Implementing this strategy with the dopant poly(styrenesulphonate)
   in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), we achieve ZT = 0.42 at room
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a novel laminate parametrization technique for
   layered composite structures that can handle problems in which the ply
   angles are limited to a discrete set. In the proposed technique, the
   classical laminate stiffnesses are expressed as a linear combination of
   the discrete options and design-variable weights. An exact penalty
   function is employed to drive the solution toward discrete 0-1 designs.
   The proposed technique can be used as either an alternative or an
   enhancement to SIMP-type methods such as discrete material optimization
   (DMO). Unlike mixed-integer approaches, our laminate parametrization
   technique is well suited for gradient-based design optimization. The
   proposed laminate parametrization is demonstrated on the compliance
   design of laminated plates and the buckling design of a laminated
   stiffened panel. The results demonstrate that the approach is an
   effective alternative to DMO methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper experimentally examines a multifunctional gust alleviation
   system and holds promise for improving small unmanned aerial vehicles
   performance in wind gusts. The designed multifunctional wing spar is
   able to harvest energy itself from the normal vibrations during flight.
   If the wing experiences any strong wind gust, it will provide vibration
   control to maintain its stability. The proposed wing spar carries on the
   functions of energy harvesting, strain sensing, and gust alleviation via
   piezoelectric materials. A closed form electromechanical cantilever
   multifunctional beam model is developed, which captures the basics of
   piezoelectric constitute equations using Euler-Lagrange equations. An
   enhanced two mode reduced energy control (REC) law is developed to
   saturate a positive strain feedback (PSF) control law, and therefore
   decrease energy consumption but maintains the same gust alleviation
   performance. An equivalent circuit model is also developed based on the
   distributed parameter method to represent a multifunctional gust
   alleviation system using harvested energy. Experimental results show
   that compared to conventional PSF control law, the REC decreases voltage
   supply from +/- 20 to +/- 4 V, uses 76\% less energy whereas maintaining
   the same performance. Experimental results also show that it is feasible
   to alleviate wind gust disturbance using harvested power from ambient
   vibrations, but requires the harvesting time to be 0.42 times longer
   than the wind gust duration.}},

Abstract = {{We have obtained Infrared Telescope Facility/SpeX spectra of eight
   moderate-redshift (z = 0.7-2.4), radio-selected (log R{*} approximate to
   0.4-1.9) broad absorption line (BAL) quasars. The spectra cover the
   rest-frame optical band. We compare the optical properties of these
   quasars to those of canonically radio-quiet (log R{*} less than or
   similar to 1) BAL quasars at similar redshifts and to low-redshift
   quasars from the Palomar-Green catalogue. As with previous studies of
   BAL quasars, we find that {[}O iii] lambda 5007 is weak, and optical Fe
   ii emission is strong, a rare combination in canonically radio-loud (log
   R{*} greater than or similar to 1) quasars. With our measurements of the
   optical properties, particularly the Balmer emission-line widths and the
   continuum luminosity, we have used empirical scaling relations to
   estimate black hole masses and Eddington ratios. These lie in the range
   (0.4-2.6) x 10(9) M-circle dot and 0.1-0.9, respectively. Despite their
   comparatively extreme radio properties relative to most BAL quasars,
   their optical properties are quite consistent with those of radio-quiet
   BAL quasars and dissimilar to those of radio-loud non-BAL quasars. While
   BAL quasars generally appear to have low values of {[}O iii] lambda
   5007/Fe ii an extreme of `Eigenvector 1', the Balmer line widths and
   Eddington ratios do not appear to significantly differ from those of
   unabsorbed quasars at similar redshifts and luminosities.}},

Abstract = {{This qualitative and descriptive study examined the feasibility of a

   prototype was developed to measure and record bed height, and to remind
   staff to keep patient beds in the lowest position. This pilot project

   Michigan community hospital. Qualitative and quantitative information
   was gathered during semistructured interviews of nursing staff (18 RNs
   and 13 PCAs; January-April 2011). Descriptive content analysis and
   descriptive analyses were performed. The overall response rate was
   44.9\%. The mean values of the feasibility questions are all favorable.
   Staff's comments also support the view that the alert system would
   promote patient safety and prevent falls. In short, this system was
   found to be somewhat useful, feasible, appropriate, and accurate. It has
   the potential to promote patient safety and prevent bed-associated
   injurious falls in inpatient care settings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computational investigation of the effect of
   time-varying humidity conditions on a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
   cell. The objective is to develop a better fundamental understanding of
   the fuel cell's performance under actual driving conditions. Such an
   understanding will be beneficial in improving the fuel cell design for
   mobile applications. The study employs a macroscopic single-fuel
   cell-based, one-dimensional, isothermal model. The novelty of the model
   is that it does not rely on the non-physical assumption of the uptake
   curve equilibrium between the pore vapor and ionomer water in the
   catalyst layers. Instead, the transition between the two phases is
   modeled as a finite-rate equilibration process. The modulating
   conditions are simulated by forcing the temporal variations in reactant
   humidity. The results show that reactant humidity modulations cause a
   departure in the cell behavior from its steady behavior, and the
   finite-rate equilibration between the catalyst vapor and liquid water
   can be a factor in determining the cell response. The cell response is
   also affected by the modulating frequency and amplitude. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Combining solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine (SOFC/GT) system is a
   promising concept for future clean and efficient power generation. An
   SOFC/GT system exploits the complementary features of the two power
   plants, where the GT recuperates the energy in the SOFC exhaust stream
   and thereby boosts the overall system efficiency. Through model-based
   transient analysis, however, it is shown that the intricate coupling
   dynamics make the transient load following very challenging. The purpose
   of this study is to examine the load-following capability of 5-kW class
   SOFC/micro-GT hybrid systems in two different configurations:
   single-shaft and dual-shaft GT designs. An optimal load-following
   operation scheme, aimed at achieving a proper trade-off between high
   steady-state efficiency and fast transient response is developed through
   model-based dynamic analysis and optimization. Simulation results are
   reported to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal scheme.

Volume = {{304}},
Pages = {{92-99}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the synthesis and characterization of catalysts
   with Pt deposited onto Mo2C supported on Al2O3 (Pt-Mo2C/Al2O3) and their
   evaluation for the water-gas shift reaction. Previously, we reported
   that Pt deposited onto Mo2C (Pt/Mo2C) was highly active for this
   reaction. Enhanced utilizations of the metal and carbide were expected
   for the Pt-Mo2C/Al2O3 catalysts. The materials were prepared using a wet
   impregnation method and characterized using techniques including X-ray
   diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, temperature-programmed
   desorption, and transmission electron microscopy. The presence of Mo2C
   enhanced the deposition of Pt from H2PtCl6 solutions. The Pt-Mo2C/Al2O3
   catalysts were much more active than the corresponding Pt/Al2O3
   catalysts. For example, the turnover frequency for the 3.8 wt.\%
   Pt-Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst at 240 degrees C (0.81 s(-1)) was two orders of
   magnitude higher than that for the 3.9 wt.\% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (0.007
   s(-1)). Trends with increasing Pt loading for the Pt-Mo2C/Al2O3
   catalysts were similar to those previously observed for Pt/Mo2C
   catalysts. The results are consistent with Pt being co-located with
   Mo2C, a consequence of the strong affinity of the Pt precursor for Mo2C.
   Interaction of the Pt with Mo2C would account for the significant
   differences between the catalytic and the surface chemical properties of
   the Pt-Mo2C/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Workers' consistent attendance is an indispensable condition for
   successful construction projects, but many construction projects still
   suffer from the productivity loss originating from workers' absenteeism.
   To deal with this problem, construction managers have mainly used formal
   controls (e.g.,penalties) targeting those individuals who present
   excessive absenteeism. However, recent research papers on absenteeism
   have testified to the paramount role of social factors, such as social
   norm, on workers' absence behavior. Despite the increasing attention
   being paid to the social factors of workers' absence behavior,
   discussion on how a social norm in favor of worker attendance control
   can be developed is sparse. If how such social norms emerge and how they
   play a role in controlling workers' behavior are clear, construction
   managers can invest time in promoting favorable absence norms rather
   than focusing on regulations targeting individuals. Therefore, this
   paper studies the system-level effect of workers' social learning using
   an experimental analysis with simulations in order to extend the
   knowledge of the social aspect in workers' absence behavior. To conduct
   the analysis, an agent-based model was developed to serve as a
   comprehensive model that incorporates mechanisms of workers' formal and
   social learning. The model was constructed by using theoretical and
   empirical findings on absence behavior drawn from scholarly literature.
   Then the constructed agent-based model was used to explore possible
   scenarios in organizations with simulations. With the simulation
   results, the following are demonstrated: (1)high social adaptation can
   work as a force to either increase or decrease workers' absence rates;
   (2)when strict self-regulation is prevalent among workers, high social
   adaptation can lead to the development of a positive social norm at the
   jobsite; and (3)when high social adaptation reinforces formal rules,
   this occurrence reduces the need for additional formal controls on
   worker behavior. The results from this paper are expected to help
   construction organizations in understanding the availability of social
   norms in favor of management, and ultimately in using the social norm
   for effective labor control that meets little resistance. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The seismic behavior of coupling beams and walls constructed with
   tensile strain-hardening, high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete
   (HPFRC) was studied through tests of large-scale precast coupling beams
   and coupled walls. A precast coupling beam design was developed to speed
   up construction and minimize interference with wall reinforcement. Three
   isolated precast coupling beam specimens with a span/depth of 1.75 were
   tested under large displacement reversals. Test results indicate the use
   of HPFRC allows a reduction of the reinforcement required to achieve a
   stable coupling beam response by providing confinement and contributing
   to beam shear strength. A concrete design shear stress capacity of ,
   where is the compressive strength of the concrete, was found to be
   appropriate. In addition to the coupling beam tests, two 4-story coupled
   wall specimens with precast HPFRC and regular concrete coupling beams
   were tested under lateral displacement reversals. Besides allowing the
   evaluation of seismic behavior of coupled walls with HPFRC coupling
   beams, the use of HPFRC in the plastic hinge regions of the walls as a
   means of relaxing transverse wall reinforcement was evaluated. The two
   coupled wall specimens exhibited drift capacities of at least 2.5\%. The
   HPFRC coupling beams were more ductile and damage-tolerant than the
   regular concrete beams. The incorporation of a HPFRC material in the
   wall allowed the use of a concrete design shear stress capacity of and a
   wider spacing of transverse reinforcement confining the wall boundary
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or liver cancer, is one of the fastest
   growing cancers in the United States. Current liver ablation methods are
   thermal based and share limitations resulting from the heat sink effect
   of blood flow through the highly vascular liver. In this study, we
   explore the feasibility of using histotripsy for non-invasive liver
   ablation in the treatment of liver cancer. Histotripsy is a non-thermal
   ablation method that fractionates soft tissue through the control of
   acoustic cavitation. Twelve histotripsy lesions similar to 1 cm(3) were
   created in the livers of six pigs through an intact abdomen and chest in
   vivo. Histotripsy pulses of 10 cycles, 500-Hz pulse repetition frequency
   (PRF), and 14- to 17-MPa estimated in situ peak negative pressure were
   applied to the liver using a 1-MHz therapy transducer. Treatments were
   performed through 4-6 cm of overlying tissue, with 30\%-50\% of the
   ultrasound pathway covered by the rib cage. Complete fractionation of
   liver parenchyma was observed, with sharp boundaries after 16.7-min
   treatments. In addition, two larger volumes of 18 and 60 cm(3) were
   generated within 60 min in two additional pigs. As major vessels and
   gallbladder have higher mechanical strength and are more resistant to
   histotripsy, these remained intact while the liver surrounding these
   structures was completely fractionated. This work shows that histotripsy
   is capable of non-invasively fractionating liver tissue while preserving
   critical anatomic structures within the liver. Results suggest
   histotripsy has potential for the non-invasive ablation of liver tumors.

Abstract = {{An ultrasound elasticity microscope was used to map 3-D strain volume in
   an ex vivo porcine cornea to illustrate its ability to measure the
   mechanical properties of this tissue. Mechanical properties of the
   cornea play an important role in its function and, therefore, also in
   ophthalmic diseases such as kerataconus and corneal ectasia. The
   ultrasound elasticity microscope combines a tightly focused
   high-frequency transducer with confocal scanning to produce high-quality
   speckle over the entire volume of tissue. This system and the analysis
   were able to generate volume maps of compressional strain in all three
   directions for porcine corneal tissue, more information than any
   previous study has reported. Strain volume maps indicated features of
   the cornea and mechanical behavior as expected. These results constitute
   a step toward better understanding of corneal mechanics and better
   treatment of corneal diseases. (E-mail:

Abstract = {{Construction engineering students often complain about the lack of
   engagement and interaction with the learning environment.
   Notwithstanding, many instructors still rely on traditional teaching
   methods which include the use of chalkboard, handouts, and computer
   presentations that are often filled with many words and few visual
   elements. Research shows that these teaching techniques are considered
   almost obsolete by a many students specially those who are visual
   learners or team workers. Also, the influence of visual and social media
   has changed student perceptions and how they expect the instructional
   materials to be presented in a classroom setting. This paper presents an
   innovative pedagogical tool that uses remote videotaping, augmented
   reality (AR), and ultra-wide band (UWB) locationing to bring live videos
   of remote construction jobsites to the classroom, create an intuitive
   interface for students to interact with the objects in the video scenes,
   and visually deliver location-aware instructional materials to them. (C)

Abstract = {{The timely and accurate assessment of the damage sustained by a building
   during catastrophic events, such as earthquakes or blasts, is critical
   in determining the building's structural safety and suitability for
   future occupancy. Among many indicators proposed for measuring
   structural integrity, especially inelastic deformations, Interstory
   Drift Ratio (IDR) remains the most trustworthy and robust metric at the
   story level. In order to calculate IDR, researchers have proposed
   several nondestructive measurement methods. Most of these methods rely
   on pre-installed target panels with known geometric shapes or with an
   emitting light source. Such target panels are difficult to install and
   maintain over the lifetime of a building. Thus, while such methods are
   nondestructive, they are not entirely non-contact. This paper proposes
   an Augmented Reality (AR)-assisted non-contact method for estimating IDR
   that does not require any pre-installed physical infrastructure on a
   building. The method identifies corner locations in a damaged building
   by detecting the intersections between horizontal building baselines and
   vertical building edges. The horizontal baselines are superimposed on
   the real structure using an AR algorithm, and the building edges are
   detected via a Line Segment Detection (LSD) approach. The proposed
   method is evaluated using a Virtual Prototyping (VP) environment that
   allows testing of the proposed method in a reconfigurable setting. A
   sensitivity analysis is also conducted to evaluate the effect of
   instrumentation errors on the method's practical use. The experimental
   results demonstrate the potential of the new method to facilitate rapid
   building damage reconnaissance, and highlight the instrument precision
   requirements necessary for practical field implementation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this work, we construct a new physics-based model of rubber
   elasticity to capture the strain softening, strain hardening, and
   deformation-state dependent response of rubber materials undergoing
   finite deformations. This model is unique in its ability to capture
   large-stretch mechanical behavior with parameters that are connected to
   the polymer chemistry and can also be easily identified with the
   important characteristics of the macroscopic stress-stretch response.
   The microscopic picture consists of two components: a crosslinked
   network of Langevin chains and an entangled network with chains confined
   to a nonaffine tube. These represent, respectively, changes in entropy
   due to thermally averaged chain conformations and changes in entropy due
   to the magnitude of these conformational fluctuations. A simple
   analytical form for the strain energy density is obtained using
   Rubinstein and Panyukov's single-chain description of network behavior.
   The model only depends on three parameters that together define the
   initial modulus, extent of strain softening, and the onset of strain
   hardening. Fits to large stretch data for natural rubber, silicone
   rubber, VHB 4905 (polyacrylate rubber), and b186 rubber (a carbon
   black-filled rubber) are presented, and a comparison is made with other
   similar constitutive models of large-stretch rubber elasticity. We
   demonstrate that the proposed model provides a complete description of
   elastomers undergoing large deformations for different applied loading
   configurations. Moreover, since the strain energy is obtained using a
   clear set of physical assumptions, this model may be tested and used to
   interpret the results of computer simulation and experiments on polymers
   of known microscopic structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the soft tissue response to
   poly(E-caprolactone) (PCL) implants with and without
   carbonate-substituted hydroxyapatite (CHA) coating compared to the
   commonly used titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V)-machined surface. Experimental
   materials were implanted subcutaneously in New Zealand white rabbits for
   5 weeks. The tissue attachment strength, as evaluated by a tissue peel
   test, histological and histomorphology analysis, as well as scanning
   electron microscopy were compared between groups. The peel test result
   revealed no statistically significant difference between groups.
   Histological analysis found fibrous capsule formation around all implant
   materials. The fibrous capsule around PCL implants with and without CHA
   coating was significantly thinner compared with the capsule thickness
   around the titanium implants. However, the inflammatory cells, as
   present at the fibrous capsule-implant interface, were found to be
   significantly lower in the Ti-group. In conclusion, the current data do
   not prove that PCL or PCL with a CHA coating results in a superior soft
   tissue response compared with a machined titanium implant. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Sooting tendencies have been measured for 29 compounds with 5 carbon
   atoms and different oxygen contents, along with 12 additional oxygenated
   pure compounds and 10 blends of commercial fuels. The test compounds
   include alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, keto-esters
   and hydroxy-esters. The Threshold Sooting Index (TSI), as defined and
   used in the literature, was primarily used to quantify the sooting
   tendency of the compounds. It is shown that this index does not account
   for the presence of oxygen atoms in the fuel molecules, and the impact
   of fuel oxygen on the stoichiometric air requirement. The application of
   TSI to oxygenated fuels leads to sooting tendencies inconsistent with
   those reported in the literature. A new sooting index is proposed for
   oxygenated and non-oxygenated compounds, which considers the relation
   between the height of the flame tip and the volumetric stoichiometric
   air requirement of the flame. This new index is denoted as the Oxygen
   Extended Sooting Index (OESI). The results obtained by this new index
   corroborate that not only the oxygen content but also the molecular
   structure has an influence on the sooting tendency of fuels. Different
   functional groups, not only those including oxygen atoms, impart
   different sooting tendencies. A structural group contribution approach
   based on group additivity is proposed to interpret experimental
   observations on the effect of oxygen functional groups on the sooting
   tendency of fuels using the example of C-5 oxygenated fuels. Groups with
   a higher fraction of carbon-carbon bonds showed a higher contribution to
   the sooting tendency than those with a higher concentration of
   carbon-hydrogen bonds. Among the C-5 mono-oxygenated compounds, the
   sooting tendency increased in this order: aldehydes < alcohols < ketones
   < ethers < n-alkanes and for the C-5 di-oxygenated compounds, the
   sooting tendency order was: acids < esters < di-ethers. In general, both
   unsaturated and branched compounds showed slight increases in sooting
   tendency with respect to their saturated and linear counterparts.
   Finally, the new sooting index was applied to commercial biofuel blends
   (denatured ethanol-gasoline and soybean-derived biodiesel-diesel) and
   empirical correlations were obtained. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for extracting the bi-axial rate dependent
   mechanical properties of thin homogenous materials, using a shock tube,
   demonstrated here using an aluminum alloy sheet. Rate dependence
   determination techniques such as Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB)
   have long been used for determining uniaxial properties. Recent advances
   have led to modification of the SHPB to include a bulge cell to develop
   a so called ``dynamic bulge test{''}. Due to the relative fixed nature
   of the SHPB, it is difficult to obtain lower strain rate response
   without significantly modifying the test fixture. Using shock wave
   loading, and a flat, circular thin plate specimen, a state of biaxial
   tensile stress is created at the center of the crown during intermediate
   to high rates of loading. An inverse modeling technique in conjunction
   with a finite element (FE) simulation technique is used to determine the
   rate dependent constitutive properties of the plate material. This work
   demonstrates the applicability of the shock loading method for
   extracting rate dependent properties of materials available in thin
   sheet form by using commercial grade aluminum. A finite element model of
   the shock response is used to determine the strain rate dependent
   mechanical properties using an optimization algorithm and an inverse
   modeling method. The results were found to be in agreement with previous
   literature and good correlation between the model and experimental
   results are presented here. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Battery state of health (SOH) monitoring has become a crucial challenge
   in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and all electric vehicles (EVs)
   research, as SOH significantly affects the overall vehicle performance
   and life cycle. In this paper, we focus on the identification of Li-ion
   battery capacity fading, as the loss of capacity and therefore the
   driving range is a primary concern for EV and plug-in HEV (PHEV). While
   most studies on battery capacity fading are based on laboratory
   measurement such as open circuit voltage (OCV) curve, few publications
   have focused on capacity loss monitoring during on-board operations. We
   propose a battery SOH monitoring scheme based on partially charging
   data. Through analysis of battery aging cycle data, a robust signature
   associated with battery aging is identified through incremental capacity
   analysis (ICA). Several algorithms to extract this signature are
   developed and evaluated for on-board SOH monitoring. The use of support
   vector regression (SVR) is shown to provide the most consistent
   identification results with moderate computational load. For battery
   cells tested, we show that the SVR model built upon the data from one
   single cell is able to predict the capacity fading of 7 other cells
   within 1\% error bound. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The integrated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)/gas turbine (GT) system is
   an appealing power generation solution for mobile applications from
   energy conversion efficiency point of view. The relatively poor dynamic
   capabilities of the SOFC/GT system, which are often the results of
   system characteristics and SOFC operation safety considerations, limit
   their widespread applications and must be enhanced to meet safe,
   efficient and fast load following requirements. To this end, the SOFC/GT
   system can be augmented by an energy storage unit (e.g., battery) and a
   dual operating generator/motor (G/M). This paper focuses on
   investigating the G/M dual mode operation and its implications on system
   transient performance and battery requirements. Active shaft load
   control is achieved to manage the load transients through: (a)
   pre-conditioning of the generator power for load step-up transients; (b)
   absorbing the excessive power by motoring operation for load step-down
   transients. By taking full advantage of the bi-directional operation of
   G/M, we show that better trade-offs between power tracking and thermal
   management can be achieved, power and energy requirements for the energy
   storage (battery) can be reduced, and overall system performance can be
   enhanced. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the formation of embedded In nanocrystals (NCs) and
   their influence on the free carrier concentration, resistivity, thermal
   conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient (S) of GaAs. The In nanocrystals
   enhance the free carrier concentration, while electron and phonon
   scattering at crystallite boundaries increases the resistivity and
   reduces the thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the room temperature
   Seebeck coefficient exhibits a 25\% increase due to carrier trapping.
   Application of this approach to more heavily doped GaAs layers will
   likely lead to further increases in S and reductions in resistivity. (C)

Abstract = {{We examine ZnSnN2, a member of the class of materials contemporarily
   termed ``earth-abundant element semiconductors,{''} with an emphasis on
   evaluating its suitability for photovoltaic applications. It is
   predicted to crystallize in an orthorhombic lattice with an energy gap
   of 2 eV. Instead, using molecular beam epitaxy to deposit high-purity,
   single crystal as well as highly textured polycrystalline thin films,
   only a monoclinic structure is observed experimentally. Far from being
   detrimental, we demonstrate that the cation sublattice disorder which
   inhibits the orthorhombic lattice has a profound effect on the energy
   gap, obviating the need for alloying to match the solar spectrum. (C)

Abstract = {{One major challenge for engineering functional nanocomposites is how to
   tune the geometry structure and control the chemical composition. We
   demonstrate here that columnar nanocomposite films can be grown by using
   alternate deposition of La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 and V2O3 on LaAlO3 (111). A solid
   state reaction, rather than simple spinodal decomposition, dictates the
   nanocomposite structure, chemical composition, and functionality. By
   controlling the deposition time ratio of the two compounds, the physical
   properties of the composite films can be tuned, thus providing a
   flexible way to tailor nanocomposites for advanced functionality. (C)

Abstract = {{We use arrested-flow pulse broadening to measure the diffusion
   coefficients of four archetype organic semiconductors in two carrier
   gases, N-2 and Ar, with a precision of 5\%. The measurements are
   realized by the injection and transport of pulses of organic molecules
   in an organic vapor phase deposition chamber, followed by their
   detection using laser induced fluorescence that dynamically measures the
   organic concentration in the gas phase. Measurements show that the
   diffusivity of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq(3)) in N-2 and Ar
   varies as the square of the temperature and inversely with pressure over
   a large range of gas conditions. We show that classical Chapman-Enskog
   theory can be used to approximate the diffusivity with an accuracy that
   depends on the physical dimensions of the organic molecular species,
   with the most accurate predictions for spherical and rigid molecules

Title = {{Packing and self-assembly of truncated triangular bipyramids}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by breakthroughs in the synthesis of faceted nano- and
   colloidal particles, as well as theoretical and computational studies of
   their packings, we investigate a family of truncated triangular
   bipyramids. We report dense periodic packings with small unit cells that
   were obtained via numerical and analytical optimization. The maximal
   packing fraction phi(max) changes continuously with the truncation
   parameter t. Eight distinct packings are identified based on
   discontinuities in the first and second derivatives of phi(max)(t).
   These packings differ in the number of particles in the fundamental
   domain (unit cell) and the type of contacts between the particles. In
   particular, we report two packings with four particles in the unit cell
   for which both phi(max)(t) and phi'(max)(t) are continuous and the
   discontinuity occurs in the second derivative only. In the self-assembly
   simulations that we perform for larger boxes with 2048 particles, only
   one out of eight packings is found to assemble. In addition, the
   degenerate quasicrystal reported previously for triangular bipyramids
   without truncation {[}Haji-Akbari et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 215702
   (2011)] assembles for truncations as high as 0.45. The self-assembly
   propensities for the structures formed in the thermodynamic limit are
   explained using the isoperimetric quotient of the particles and the
   coordination number in the disordered fluid and in the assembled
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of published studies have examined the properties of
   either networks of citation among scientific papers or networks of
   coauthorship among scientists. Here we study an extensive data set
   covering more than a century of physics papers published in the Physical
   Review, which allows us to construct both citation and coauthorship
   networks for the same set of papers. We analyze these networks to gain
   insight into temporal changes in citation and collaboration over the
   long time period of the data, as well as correlations and interactions
   between the two. Among other things, we investigate the change over time
   in the number of publishing authors, the number of papers they publish,
   and the number of others with whom they collaborate, changes in the
   typical number of citations made and received, the extent to which
   individuals tend to cite themselves or their collaborators more than
   others, the extent to which they cite themselves or their collaborators
   more quickly after publication, and the extent to which they tend to
   return the favor of a citation from another scientist.}},

Abstract = {{A method is described for computing patient-specific absorbed dose rates
   to active marrow which accounts for spatial variation in bone volume
   fraction and marrow cellularity. A module has been added to the 3D Monte
   Carlo dosimetry program DPM to treat energy deposition in the components
   of bone spongiosa distinctly. Homogeneous voxels in regions containing
   bone spongiosa (as defined on CT images) are assumed to be comprised
   only of bone, active (red) marrow and inactive (yellow) marrow.
   Cellularities are determined from biopsy, and bone volume fractions are
   computed from cellularities and CT-derived voxel densities. Electrons
   are assumed to deposit energy locally in the three constituent
   components in proportions determined by electron energy absorption
   fractions which depend on energy, cellularity, and bone volume fraction,
   and which are either taken from the literature or are derived from Monte
   Carlo simulations using EGS5. Separate algorithms are used to model
   primary beta particles and secondary electrons generated after photon
   interactions. Treating energy deposition distinctly in bone spongiosa
   constituents leads to marrow dosimetry results which differ from
   homogeneous spongiosa dosimetry by up to 20\%. Dose rates in active
   marrow regions with cellularities of 20, 50, and 80\% can vary by up to
   20\%, and can differ by up to 10\% as a function of bone volume
   fraction. Dose to bone marrow exhibits a strong dependence on marrow
   cellularity and a potentially significant dependence on bone volume
   fraction.}},

Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{We present Spitzer InfraRed Spectrograph low-resolution spectra of 16
   spectroscopically selected post-starburst quasars (PSQs) at z similar to
   0.3. The optical spectra of these broad-lined active galactic nuclei
   (AGNs) simultaneously show spectral signatures of massive
   intermediate-aged stellar populations making them good candidates for
   studying the connections between AGNs and their hosts. The resulting
   spectra show relatively strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
   emission features at 6.2 and 11.3 mu m and a very weak silicate feature,
   indicative of ongoing star formation and low dust obscuration levels for
   the AGNs. We find that the mid-infrared composite spectrum of PSQs has
   spectral properties between ULIRGs and QSOs, suggesting that PSQs are
   hybrid AGN and starburst systems as also seen in their optical spectra.
   We also find that PSQs in early-type host galaxies tend to have
   relatively strong AGN activities, while those in spiral hosts have
   stronger PAH emission, indicating more star formation.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound-driven microbubbles produce mechanical forces that can
   disrupt cell membranes (sonoporation). However, it is difficult to
   control microbubble location with respect to cells. This lack of control
   leads to low sonoporation efficiencies and variable outcomes. In this
   study, aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) droplets are used to localize
   microbubbles in select micro-regions at the surface of living cells.
   This is achieved by stably partitioning microbubbles in dextran (DEX)
   droplets, deposited on living adherent cells in medium containing
   polyethylene glycol (PEG). The interfacial energy at the PEG-DEX
   interface overcomes microbubble buoyancy and prevents microbubbles from
   floating away from the cells. Spreading of the small DEX droplets
   retains microbubbles at the cell surface in defined lateral positions
   without the need for antibody or cell-binding ligand conjugation. The
   patterned microbubbles are activated on a cell monolayer exposed to a
   broadly applied ultrasound field (center frequency 1.25 MHz, active
   element diameter 0.6 cm, pulse duration 8 s or 30 s). This system
   enables efficient testing of different ultrasound conditions for their
   effects on sonoporation-mediated membrane disruption and cell viability.
   Regions of cells without patterned microbubbles show no injury or
   membrane disruption. In microbubble patterned regions, 8 s ultrasound
   pulses (0.2-0.6 MPa) produce cell death that is primarily apoptotic.
   Ultrasound-induced apoptosis increases with higher extracellular calcium
   concentrations, with cells displaying all of the hallmarks of apoptosis
   including annexinV labeling, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential,
   caspase activation and changes in nuclear morphology.}},

Abstract = {{Conducting nanofibers composed of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and
   poly(3,4-ethylenedi oxythiophene) (PEDOT) were fabricated by a dual
   process using the electrospinning (ES) and oxidative polymerization (OP)
   methods. PMMA nanofibers containing the EDOT monomer were prepared by
   electrospinning a PMMA and EDOT monomer mixture onto an oxidant
   solution. The final products, PEDOT-coated PMMA nanofibers, were
   synthesized during the OP process; EDOT monomer-swollen PMMA nanofibers
   provided a stable template for the growth of the thin PEDOT layer. The
   morphology of the PEDOT-coated PMMA nanofibers was analyzed using
   scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The
   growth mechanism of the EDOT monomer on the electrospun PMMA nanofibers
   was monitored using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In
   addition, the conductivity of the PEDOT-coated PMMA nanofiber mats was
   measured by the van der Pauw method. The PEDOT-coated PMMA nanofiber
   mats prepared in this study exhibited good electrical properties and are
   expected to be excellent candidates for the fabrication of flexible
   electronic devices such as thermoelectric devices, gas sensors, and
   energy-storage systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsion of core shell construction is
   first generated via microfluidics and freeze-dried thereafter to yield,
   upon subsequent reconstitution, an aqueous dispersion of antibubbles.
   Stable antibubbles are attained by stabilization of the air-water
   interfaces through a combination of adsorbed particles and polymeric
   surfactant. The antibubbles strongly resemble the double emulsion
   templates from which they were formed. When triggered to release,
   antibubbles show complete release of their cores within about 100 ms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses time-resolved small-angle neutron scattering
   results that were used to investigate asphaltene structure and stability
   with and without a precipitant added in both crude oil and model oil. A
   novel approach was used to isolate the scattering from asphaltenes that
   are insoluble and in the process of aggregating from those that are
   soluble. It was found that both soluble and insoluble asphaltenes form
   fractal clusters in crude oil and the fractal dimension of the insoluble
   asphaltene clusters is higher than that of the soluble clusters. Adding
   heptane also increases the size of soluble asphaltene clusters without
   modifying the fractal dimension. Understanding the process of insoluble
   asphaltenes forming fractals with higher fractal dimensions will
   potentially reveal the microscopic asphaltene destabilization mechanism
   (i.e., how a precipitant modifies asphaltene-asphaltene interactions).
   It was concluded that because of the polydisperse nature of asphaltenes,
   no well-defined asphaltene phase stability envelope exists and small
   amounts of asphaltenes precipitated even at dilute precipitant
   concentrations. Asphaltenes that are stable in a crude oil precipitant
   mixture are dispersed on the nanometer length scale. An asphaltene
   precipitation mechanism is proposed that is consistent with the
   experimental findings. Additionally, it was found that the
   heptane-insoluble asphaltene fraction is the dominant source of
   small-angle scattering in crude oil and the previously unobtainable
   asphaltene solubility at low heptane concentrations was measured.}},

Abstract = {{Fully manual use of conventional multiwell plates makes enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based immunoassays highly time-consuming and
   labor-intensive. Here, we present a capillarity-driven on-chip
   immunoassay that greatly saves time and labor with an inexpensive setup.
   Our immunoassay process starts with pipetting multiple solutions into
   multiwells constructed on a microfluidic device chip. Subsequently,
   capillarity spontaneously transports multiple sample solutions and
   common reagent solutions into assigned detection channels on the chip in
   a purely passive and preprogrammed manner. Our device implements
   capillarity-driven immunoassays involving four sample and six reagent
   solutions within 30 min by orchestrating the functions of on-chip
   passive components. Notably, our immunoassay technique reduces the total
   number of pipetting processes by similar to 5 times, as compared to
   assays on multiwell plates (48 vs 10). This assay technique allows us to
   quantify the concentrations of C-reactive protein and suppressor of
   tumorigenicity 2 with a detection limit of 8 and 90 pM, respectively.
   This device should be useful for sophisticated, parallel biochemical
   microfluidic processing in point-of-care settings under limited

   Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection}},

Abstract = {{Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are
   key anti-and pro-inflammatory mediators elicited during the host immune
   response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Understanding the opposing
   effects of these mediators is difficult due to the complexity of
   processes acting across different spatial (molecular, cellular, and
   tissue) and temporal (seconds to years) scales. We take an in silico
   approach and use multi-scale agent based modeling of the immune response
   to Mtb, including molecular scale details for both TNF-alpha and IL-10.
   Our model predicts that IL-10 is necessary to modulate macrophage
   activation levels and to prevent host-induced tissue damage in a
   granuloma, an aggregate of cells that forms in response to Mtb. We show
   that TNF-alpha and IL-10 parameters related to synthesis, signaling, and
   spatial distribution processes control concentrations of TNF-alpha and
   IL-10 in a granuloma and determine infection outcome in the long-term.
   We devise an overall measure of granuloma function based on three
   metrics - total bacterial load, macrophage activation levels, and
   apoptosis of resting macrophages - and use this metric to demonstrate a
   balance of TNF-alpha and IL-10 concentrations is essential to Mtb
   infection control, within a single granuloma, with minimal host-induced
   tissue damage. Our findings suggest that a balance of TNF-alpha and
   IL-10 defines a granuloma environment that may be beneficial for both
   host and pathogen, but perturbing the balance could be used as a novel
   therapeutic strategy to modulate infection outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The growth behavior of the Kr bubbles in Kr+ irradiated
   Zr-1.1Nb-1.51Fe-0.26Cu-0.72Ni alloy was studied by in situ transmission
   electron microscopy. Results show that the distributions of Kr bubbles
   are not uniform in the zirconium alloy matrix after annealing at 700 K,
   875 K, 1025 K, 1125 K and 1225 K, respectively. The Kr bubbles started
   to grow slowly when the sample was annealed at a temperature below 1025
   K. The average sizes of the gas bubbles were observed to grow only about
   0.4 nm in diameter at 700 K for 170 min and 0.9 nm at 875 K for 240 min,
   respectively. However, gas bubbles grew very quickly at 1225 K. The
   largest size of the gas bubbles is over 200 nm after 180 min annealing.
   The relationship between the bubble size and the annealing time was
   obtained at the designed annealing temperature. An empirical formula for
   calculating the bubble size was suggested by fitting equations derived
   from the experiment data. Finally, the growth mechanism of the bubbles
   in the zirconium alloy was discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published

Title = {{Low-temperature transport properties of Tl-doped Bi2Te3 single crystals}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{While the bulk, stoichiometric Bi2Te3 single crystals often exhibit
   p-type metallic electrical conduction due to the Bi-Te-type antisite
   defects, doping by thallium (Bi(2-x)Tl(x)Te3,x = 0-0.30) progressively
   changes the electrical conduction of single crystals from p type (0 <= x
   <= 0.08) to n type (0.12 <= x <= 0.30). This is observed via
   measurements of both the Seebeck coefficient and the Hall effect
   performed in the crystallographic (0001) plane in the temperature range
   of 2-300 K. Since any kind of substitution of Tl on the Bi or Te
   sublattices would result in an enhancement of the density of holes
   rather than its decrease, and because simple incorporation of Tl at
   interstitial sites or in the van der Waals gap is unlikely as it would
   increase the lattice parameters which is not observed in experiments,
   incorporation of Tl likely proceeds via the formation of TlBiTe2
   fragments coexisting with the quintuple layer structure of Bi2Te3. At
   low levels of Tl, 0 <= x <= 0.05, the temperature-dependent in-plane (I
   perpendicular to c) electrical resistivity maintains its metallic
   character as the density of holes decreases. Heavier Tl content with
   0.08 <= x <= 0.12 drives the electrical resistivity into a prominent
   nonmetallic regime displaying characteristic metal-insulator transitions
   upon cooling to below similar to 100 K. At the highest concentrations of
   Tl, 0.20 <= x <= 0.30, the samples revert back into the metallic state
   with low resistivity. Thermal conductivity measurements of Bi2Te3 single
   crystals containing Tl, as examined by the Debye-Callaway phonon
   conductivity model, reveal a generally stronger point-defect scattering
   of phonons with the increasing Tl content. The systematic evolution of
   transport properties suggests that the Fermi level of Bi2Te3, which
   initially lies in the valence band (for x = 0), gradually shifts toward
   the top of the valence band (for 0.01 <= x <= 0.05), then moves into the
   band gap (for 0.08 <= x <= 0.12), and eventually intersects the
   conduction band (for 0.20 <= x <= 0.30).}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 12}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical forces are critical to modulate cell spreading,
   contractility, gene expression, and even stem cell differentiation. Yet,
   existing tools that can apply controllable subcellular forces to a large
   number of single cells simultaneously are still limited. Here we report
   a novel ultrasound tweezing cytometry utilizing ultrasound pulses to
   actuate functionalized lipid microbubbles covalently attached to single
   live cells to exert mechanical forces in the pN - nN range. Ultrasonic
   excitation of microbubbles could elicit a rapid and sustained reactive
   intracellular cytoskeleton contractile force increase in different
   adherent mechanosensitive cells. Further, ultrasound-mediated
   intracellular cytoskeleton contractility enhancement was dose-dependent
   and required an intact actin cytoskeleton as well as RhoA/ROCK
   signaling. Our results demonstrated the great potential of ultrasound
   tweezing cytometry technique using functionalized microbubbles as an
   actuatable, biocompatible, and multifunctional agent for biomechanical
   stimulations of cells.}},

Title = {{Predicting the laser weldability of dissimilar polymers}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3891-3897}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{The determination of whether two dissimilar polymers are weldable is
   still largely trial-and-error. Here we suggest a correlation between
   laser weld strength and the ratio of the equilibrium interpenetration
   depth (w(infinity)) of two immiscible polymers to the maximum
   entanglement tube diameter of the two polymers (am). Taking the weld
   strength from a published chart of qualitative weld strength, we find a
   correlation coefficient between this and the ratio w(infinity)/a(max) of
   0.67, where w. is based on the simple Hildebrand solubility parameter.
   This encouraged a quantitative study of the laser weld strength. This
   was done using a through transmission laser welding process with 0.4\%
   carbon black as an absorber. The laser welds were tensile tested and
   relative weld strengths obtained. This strength was compared to the
   w(infinity)/a(max) ratio, where w. is based on experimentally determined
   Hansen solubility parameters. The results suggest weldability between
   dissimilar polymers is obtainable when w./amax is greater than 0.15. (C)

Abstract = {{The reliability of chronic, brain-penetrating electrodes must be
   improved for these -neural recording technologies to be viable in
   widespread clinical applications. One approach to improving electrode
   reliability is to reduce the foreign body response at the probe-tissue
   interface. In this work, silk fibroin is investigated as a candidate
   material for fabricating mechanically dynamic neural probes with
   enhanced biocompatibility compared to traditional electrode materials.
   Silk coatings are applied to flexible cortical electrodes to produce
   devices that transition from stiff to flexible upon hydration.
   Theoretical modeling and in vitro testing show that the silk coatings
   impart mechanical properties sufficient for the electrodes to penetrate
   brain tissue. Further, it is demonstrated that silk coatings may reduce
   some markers of gliosis in an in vitro model and that silk can
   encapsulate and release the gliosis-modifying enzyme chondroitinase ABC.
   This work establishes a basis for future in vivo studies of silk-based
   brain-penetrating electrodes, as well as the use of silk materials for
   other applications in the central nervous system where gliosis must be
   controlled.}},

Abstract = {{The membrane-active enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) catalyzes the
   hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond in phospholipids and plays a
   critical role in cell signaling. This catalytic reaction proceeds on
   lipid-water interfaces and is an example of heterogeneous catalysis in
   biology. Recently we showed that planar lipid bilayers, a previously
   unexplored model membrane for these kinetic studies, can be used for
   monitoring interfacial catalytic reactions under well-defined
   experimental conditions with chemical and electrical access to both
   sides of the lipid membrane. Employing an assay that relies on the
   conductance of the pore-forming peptide gramicidin A to monitor PLD
   activity, the work presented here reveals the kinetics of hydrolysis of
   long-chain phosphatidylcholine lipids in situ. We have developed an
   extension of a basic kinetic model for interfacial catalysis that
   includes product activation and substrate depletion. This model
   describes the kinetic behavior very well and reveals two kinetic

   constant. This approach results in a simple and general model to account
   for product accumulation in interfacial enzyme kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal unintentional
   injuries among hospitalized children with playground equipment
   accounting for more than 50\%. National standards for playground rung
   and rail design exist, but there a lack of in vivo models available to
   test these standards. We developed a novel in vivo model to test rung
   and rail design. We report the feasibility and safety of the model.
   METHODS: A device was built to simulate children hanging onto a
   playground bar until their hand slips off. This was defined as breakaway
   strength. The handle unit was mounted on a vertical cable that was
   mechanically raised and lowered using a linear actuator controlled by
   the experimenter. The unit was padded and contained a video camera that
   recorded the posture of the hand during each trial. Breakaway force and
   torque were recorded as they held onto the handle by LabView software.
   In addition, standard anthropometrics and grip strength were recorded.
   RESULTS: Biomedical engineering approved the device. There were 425
   eligible students aged 5 years to 11 years. Of these, 93\% (397)
   participated (212 males and 185 females). Ninety-nine percent (396 of
   397) completed all three experimental stations, one declined because of
   fear. There were no injuries and no falls. Average time to complete the
   study was 22 +/- 0.5 minutes. Ninety-one percent of participants were
   right handed; the ethnicity was representative of the local area with
   79\% being white. Mean +/- SD height, weight, and body mass index for
   the 397 participants were 1.28 +/- 0.11 m, 28.0 +/- 8.12 kg, and 16.31
   +/- 2.59 kg/m(2), respectively. Hand size, grip strength, and maximum
   breakaway force increased with age.
   CONCLUSION: This model is safe and feasible and maybe a viable method to
   assess rung and rail design for playgrounds. Copyright (C) 2013 by

Abstract = {{The resonance of diurnal tidal elevations is investigated with a forward
   ocean tide model run in a realistic near-global domain and a synthesis
   of free oscillations (normal modes) computed for realistic global ocean
   geometries and ocean physics. As a prelude to performing the forward
   ocean tide simulations, the topographic wave drag, which is now commonly
   employed in forward ocean tide models, is tuned specifically for diurnal
   tides. The synthesis of global free oscillations predicts reasonably
   well the forward ocean diurnal tide model sensitivity to changes in the
   frequency, zonal structure, and meridional structure of the astronomical
   diurnal tidal forcing. Three global free oscillations that are important
   for understanding diurnal tides as a superposition of forced-damped,
   resonant, free oscillations are identified. An admittance analysis of
   the frequency sweep experiments demonstrates that some coastal locations
   such as the Sea of Okhotsk are resonant to diurnal tidal forcing. As in
   earlier work done with semidiurnal tides, a series of simulations are
   performed in which regions possessing significant coastal diurnal tides
   are blocked out. The largest perturbations to the open-ocean diurnal
   tides take place in Blocked Sea of Okhotsk experiments. Lesser but still
   significant perturbations also arise from the blocking out of other
   regions of large diurnal tidal elevations or dissipation. Interpretation
   of the results is made more complex, however, by the fact that
   substantial perturbations also arise from blocking out regions where
   neither tidal elevations nor dissipation are large. The blocking
   experiments are relevant to understanding tides of the ice age, during
   which lower sea levels entail a reduced area of continental shelves.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate measurement of the immune status in patients with immune
   system disorders is critical in evaluating the stage of diseases and
   tailoring drug treatments. The functional cellular immunity test is a
   promising method to establish the diagnosis of immune dysfunctions. The
   conventional functional cellular immunity test involves measurements of
   the capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to produce
   pro-inflammatory cytokines when stimulated ex vivo. However, this bulk
   assay measures the overall reactivity of a population of lymphocytes and
   monocytes, making it difficult to pinpoint the phenotype or real
   identity of the reactive immune cells involved. In this research, we
   develop a large surface micromachined poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   microfiltration membrane (PMM) with high porosity, which is integrated
   in a microfluidic microfiltration platform. Using the PMM with
   functionalized microbeads conjugated with antibodies against specific
   cell surface proteins, we demonstrated rapid, efficient and
   high-throughput on-chip isolation, enrichment, and stimulation of
   subpopulations of immune cells from blood specimens. Furthermore, the
   PMM-integrated microfiltration platform, coupled with a no-wash
   homogeneous chemiluminescence assay (AlphaLISA), enables us to
   demonstrate rapid and sensitive on-chip immunophenotyping assays for
   subpopulations of immune cells isolated directly from minute quantities
   of blood samples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with two issues that arise in the finite element
   analysis of 3D solids. The first issue examines the objectivity of
   various stress rates that are adopted in incremental analysis of solids.
   In doing so, it is revealed that large errors are incurred by an
   improper choice of stress rate. An example problem is presented to show
   the implications of the choice of stress rate. The second issue
   addresses the need to maintain work-conjugacy in formulating and solving
   bifurcation buckling problems of 3D elastic solids. Four popular
   commercial codes are used to obtain buckling loads of an axially
   compressed thick sandwich panel, and it is shown that large errors in
   buckling load predictions are incurred as a result of violating the
   requirement of work-conjugacy. Remedies to fix the errors in the
   numerical solution strategy are given.}},

Abstract = {{Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a long and flexible biopolymer that
   contains genetic information. Building upon the discovery of the iconic
   double helix over 50 years ago, subsequent studies have emphasized how
   its biological function is related to the mechanical properties of the
   molecule. A remarkable system which highlights the role of DNA bending
   and twisting is the packing and ejection of DNA into and from viral
   capsids. A recent 3D reconstruction of bacteriophage phi 29 reveals a
   novel toroidal structure of highly bent/twisted DNA contained in a small
   cavity below the viral capsid. Here, we extend an elastic rod model for
   DNA to enable simulation of the toroid as it is compacted and
   subsequently ejected from a small volume. We compute
   biologically-relevant forces required to form the toroid and predict
   ejection times of several nanoseconds.}},

Abstract = {{Homogeneous charge compression iginition (HCCI) combustion allows for
   the use of fuels with octane requirements below that of spark-ignited
   engines. A reference gasoline was compared with iso-octane and a low
   octane blend of gasoline and 40\% n-heptane, NH40. Experiments were
   conducted on a single cylinder engine operating with negative valve
   overlap (NVO). The fuel flow rate per cycle was compensated based on the
   lower heating value to maintain a constant energy addition across fuels.
   Iso-octane and gasoline demonstrated similar maximum load, achieving a
   gross IMEPg of similar to 430 kPa, whereas the NH40 demonstrated an
   increased IMEPg of similar to 460 kPa. The NH40 could be operated at a
   later phasing compared with the higher octane fuels, and exhibited a
   shorter burn duration at a given fueling rate and phasing. These results
   could be due to compositional differences, as NH40 required less NVO
   compared to iso-octane and gasoline, leading to less thermal and
   compositional stratification, as well as a higher O-2 concentration and
   less residual gas. Additionally, the NH40 fuel demonstrated a higher
   intermediate temperature heat release than the higher octane fuels,
   potentially contributing to the shorter burn duration. Overall, these
   results demonstrate clear benefits to NVO enabled HCCI combustion with
   low octane fuels.}},

Title = {{Combined Experimental and Computational Investigation of Unsteady

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to apply combined experimental and
   computational modeling to investigate unsteady sheet/cloud cavitating
   flows. In the numerical simulations, a filter-based density corrected
   model (FBDCM) is introduced to regulate the turbulent eddy viscosity in
   both the cavitation regions on the foil and in the wake, which is shown
   to be critical in accurately capturing the unsteady cavity shedding
   process, and the corresponding velocity and vorticity dynamics. In the
   experiments, high-speed video and particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   technique are used to measure the flow velocity and vorticity fields, as
   well as cavitation patterns. Results are presented for a Clark-Y
   hydrofoil fixed at an angle of attack of a 8 deg at a moderate Reynolds
   number, Re = 7 x 10(5), for both subcavitating and sheet/cloud
   cavitating conditions. The results show that for the unsteady
   sheet/cloud cavitating case, the formation, breakup, shedding, and
   collapse of the sheet/cloud cavity lead to substantial increase in
   turbulent velocity fluctuations in the cavitating region around the foil
   and in the wake, and significantly modified the wake patterns. The
   turbulent boundary layer thickness is found to be much thicker, and the
   turbulent intensities are much higher in the sheet/cloud cavitating
   case. Compared to the wetted case, the wake region becomes much broader
   and is directed toward the suction side instead of the pressure side for
   the sheet/cloud cavitation case. The periodic formation, breakup,
   shedding, and collapse of the sheet/cloud cavities, and the associated
   baroclinic and viscoclinic torques, are shown to be important mechanisms
   for vorticity production and modification.}},

Title = {{Maximizing the Value of Mobile Health Monitoring by Avoiding Redundant
   Patient Reports: Prediction of Depression-Related Symptoms and Adherence
   Problems in Automated Health Assessment Services}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background: Interactive voice response (IVR) calls enhance health
   systems' ability to identify health risk factors, thereby enabling
   targeted clinical follow-up. However, redundant assessments may increase
   patient dropout and represent a lost opportunity to collect more
   clinically useful data.
   Objective: We determined the extent to which previous IVR assessments
   predicted subsequent responses among patients with depression diagnoses,
   potentially obviating the need to repeatedly collect the same
   information. We also evaluated whether frequent (ie, weekly) IVR
   assessment attempts were significantly more predictive of patients'
   subsequent reports than information collected biweekly or monthly.
   Methods: Using data from 1050 IVR assessments for 208 patients with
   depression diagnoses, we examined the predictability of four
   IVR-reported outcomes: moderate/severe depressive symptoms (score >= 10
   on the PHQ-9), fair/poor general health, poor antidepressant adherence,
   and days in bed due to poor mental health. We used logistic models with
   training and test samples to predict patients' IVR responses based on
   their five most recent weekly, biweekly, and monthly assessment
   attempts. The marginal benefit of more frequent assessments was
   evaluated based on Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves and
   statistical comparisons of the area under the curves (AUC).
   Results: Patients' reports about their depressive symptoms and perceived
   health status were highly predictable based on prior assessment
   responses. For models predicting moderate/severe depression, the AUC was
   0.91 (95\% CI 0.89-0.93) when assuming weekly assessment attempts and
   only slightly less when assuming biweekly assessments (AUC: 0.89; CI
   0.87-0.91) or monthly attempts (AUC: 0.89; CI 0.86-0.91). The AUC for
   models predicting reports of fair/poor health status was similar when
   weekly assessments were compared with those occurring biweekly (P value
   for the difference=.11) or monthly (P=.81). Reports of medication
   adherence problems and days in bed were somewhat less predictable but
   also showed small differences between assessments attempted weekly,
   biweekly, and monthly.
   Conclusions: The technical feasibility of gathering high frequency
   health data via IVR may in some instances exceed the clinical benefit of
   doing so. Predictive analytics could make data gathering more efficient
   with negligible loss in effectiveness. In particular, weekly or biweekly
   depressive symptom reports may provide little marginal information
   regarding how the person is doing relative to collecting that
   information monthly. The next generation of automated health assessment
   services should use data mining techniques to avoid redundant
   assessments and should gather data at the frequency that maximizes the
   value of the information collected.}},

Abstract = {{This short review provides an overview of the impact micro- and
   nanotechnologies can make in studying epigenetic structures. The
   importance of mapping histone modifications on chromatin prompts us to
   highlight the complexities and challenges associated with histone
   mapping, as compared to DNA sequencing. First, the histone code
   comprised over 30 variations, compared to 4 nucleotides for DNA. Second,
   whereas DNA can be amplified using polymerase chain reaction, chromatin
   cannot be amplified, creating challenges in obtaining sufficient
   material for analysis. Third, while every person has only a single
   genome, there exist multiple epigenomes in cells of different types and
   origins. Finally, we summarize existing technologies for performing
   these types of analyses. Although there are still relatively few
   examples of micro-and nanofluidic technologies for chromatin analysis,
   the unique advantages of using such technologies to address inherent
   challenges in epigenetic studies, such as limited sample material,
   complex readouts, and the need for high-content screens, make this an
   area of significant growth and opportunity. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Pages = {{793-811}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The work described herein seeks to investigate a probabilistic framework
   to evaluate the fire resistance of structures given uncertainty in the
   fire load and structural resistance parameters. The methodology involves
   (i) the identification and characterization of uncertain parameters in
   the system, (ii) a stochastic analysis of the thermo-mechanical response
   of the structure, and (iii) the evaluation of structural reliability
   based on a suitable limit state function. The methodology is
   demonstrated through the analysis of a protected steel beam using Monte
   Carlo simulation with embedded finite element simulations. Model
   dimensionality is reduced using a response sensitivity analysis, and
   limit state functions are defined based on limiting deflection criteria
   used in fire resistance tests. Results demonstrate that the 1-h rated
   beam resists a natural fire exposure with a failure probability of less
   than ten percent, although additional discussion is warranted regarding
   what might be considered an acceptable level of risk in structural fire
   design. The study also demonstrates that probabilistic analysis of
   structural fire resistance provides an enhanced understanding of the
   factors affecting the resistance of structures to fire and offers a
   means for rationally improving structural designs to meet target

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of an initial attempt of using iron ore
   tailings (IOTs) to develop greener engineered cementitious composites
   (ECCs). ECC is a unique class of high-performance fiber-reinforced
   cementitious composites featuring high tensile ductility and durability.
   However, the high cement usage in ECC limits the material greenness and
   increases the material cost compared with normal concrete. In this
   paper, IOTs in powder form are used to partially replace cement to
   enhance the environmental sustainability of ECC. Mechanical properties
   and material greenness of ECC containing various proportions of IOTs are
   investigated. The newly developed versions of ECC in this paper, with a
   cement content of , exhibit a tensile ductility of 2.3-3.3\%, tensile
   strength of 5.1-6.0MPa, and compressive strength of 46-57MPa at 28days.
   The replacement of cement with IOTs results in 10-32\% reduction in
   energy consumption and 29-63\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in
   green ECC compared with typical ECC. Thus, the feasibility of producing
   greener ECC with significantly reduced environmental impact using IOTs,

   a narrow distribution of MoS2 flake thicknesses (i.e., 3.0 +/- 1.9 nm)
   over cm(2)-scale areas. Furthermore, we experimentally show that our
   plasma-assisted printing process can be generally used for producing
   other emerging atomically layered nanostructures (e.g., graphene
   nanoribbons). We also demonstrate working n-type transistors made from
   printed MoS2 flakes that exhibit excellent properties (e.g., ON/OFF
   current ratio 10(5)-10(7), field-effect mobility on SiO2 gate
   dielectrics 6 to 44 cm(2)/(V s)) as well as good uniformity of such
   transistor parameters over a large area. Finally, with additional plasma
   treatment processes, we also show the feasibility of creation of p-type
   transistors as well as pn junctions in MoS2 flakes. This work lays an
   important foundation for future scale-up nanoelectronic applications of
   few-layer-MoS2 micro- and nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{We develop new metrics for texture similarity that accounts for human
   visual perception and the stochastic nature of textures. The metrics
   rely entirely on local image statistics and allow substantial
   point-by-point deviations between textures that according to human
   judgment are essentially identical. The proposed metrics extend the
   ideas of structural similarity and are guided by research in texture
   analysis-synthesis. They are implemented using a steerable filter
   decomposition and incorporate a concise set of subband statistics,
   computed globally or in sliding windows. We conduct systematic tests to
   investigate metric performance in the context of ``known-item
   search,{''} the retrieval of textures that are ``identical{''} to the
   query texture. This eliminates the need for cumbersome subjective tests,
   thus enabling comparisons with human performance on a large database.
   Our experimental results indicate that the proposed metrics outperform
   peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity metric (SSIM)
   and its variations, as well as state-of-the-art texture classification
   metrics, using standard statistical measures.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a radio-frequency plasma thruster is evaluated using
   a displacement-type, inverted-pendulum thrust stand in the Large Vacuum
   Test Facility at the University of Michigan. A radio-frequency generator
   supplies up to 2000 W to the radio-frequency plasma thruster at a fixed
   frequency of 13.56 MHz. The matching network is placed inside the vacuum
   chamber at the thruster, and the radio-frequency power is measured at
   the matching network input port with a dual-directional coupler. A
   Faraday probe measures the current density in the far-field exhaust of
   the thruster, a retarding potential analyzer characterizes the ion
   voltage distribution, and a Langmuir probe measures the plasma
   potential. The radio-frequency plasma thruster is operated with argon
   propellant at mass flow rates of 2.4-7.6 m g/s, at corresponding
   corrected facility pressures of 1.5 x 10(-6)-4.6 x 10(-6) torr. The
   maximum thrust observed is 10.8 mN, and the maximum specific impulse is
   303 s. Thrust efficiency is below 1\% at all conditions. Faraday probe
   results show that the propellant utilization efficiency is below 15\%
   and that the ionized exhaust has an effective divergence half-angle of
   48 deg. Thrust is negatively correlated with the ion beam most probable
   voltage, showing that retarding potential analyzer results alone may not
   accurately characterize thruster performance. Charge-exchange collisions
   likely have a significant influence on radio-frequency plasma thruster
   operation.}},

Abstract = {{Future high-mass spacecraft entering the thin Martian atmosphere will
   exceed the capabilities of supersonic and subsonic parachutes and will
   incorporate other means of deceleration. Propulsive deceleration is one
   technology that is being considered. The interaction of the spacecraft
   aerodynamics with the propulsion deceleration jets has been shown to
   cause a decrease in drag coefficient with increasing thrust coefficient,
   which is not desirable for deceleration. Planar laser-induced iodine
   fluorescence images for a single-propulsion deceleration jet showed a
   lifting of the vehicle bow shock away from the aeroshell. Flowfield
   calculations showed that this lifting provided a shielding effect,
   preventing the freestream mass and momentum flux from reaching the
   aeroshell surface, creating a low-pressure region between the jet
   boundary and the aeroshell. With four peripheral propulsive deceleration
   jets, planar laser-induced fluorescence images and computational fluid
   dynamics calculations showed that the vehicle bow shock is maintained
   between the jets as the thrust coefficient is increased. This bow shock
   is responsible for greater drag preservation with the peripheral jets.
   The calculations also showed that high pressure is maintained between
   the peripheral jets. These results suggest that using a few peripheral
   propulsion-deceleration jets located near the aeroshell shoulder would
   provide the greatest drag preservation when using propulsive
   deceleration.}},

Abstract = {{With the advances in deployable membrane technologies, the possibility
   of developing large, lightweight reflectors has greatly improved.
   However, to achieve the required accuracy, precision surface control is
   needed. The goal of this research was to investigate the feasibility of
   applying distributed polyvinylidene fluoride actuators and domain
   control on a flexible reflector and address some of the technical
   challenges. An analytical model of the integrated reflector-actuator
   system was developed. A Kapton reflector with polyvinylidene fluoride
   actuators was experimentally tested and compared with the model. A new
   least-squares control law is designed to ensure optimal solutions are
   derived in a rigorous manner when constraints are applied. The model is
   exercised using individually controlled polyvinylidene fluoride
   actuators on a large-scale reflector under thermal load. Although the
   results are promising with the large number of actuators applied, the
   major challenge is that it is unrealistic to have the same number of
   power supplies as actuators in actual applications. To resolve this
   issue, a new optimization methodology was developed, designated as the
   en masse elimination algorithm, which finds the global optimal solution
   that groups the actuators to match the limited number of power supplies
   and achieve minimum surface error.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the microscale investigation of a new
   fiber-reinforced cementitious composite, high-strength, high-ductility
   concrete (HSHDC), which possesses a rare combination of very high
   compressive strength (166 MPa {[}24.1 ksi]) and very high tensile
   ductility (3.4\% strain capacity). The investigation involved
   experimental determination of fiber/matrix interaction properties using
   single-fiber pullout tests. A new mechanism of inclination-dependent
   hardening in fiber pullout unique for a high-strength cementitious
   matrix-is discovered. The existing fiber-pullout analytical model for
   strain-hardening cementitious composites (SHCCs) is modified to
   incorporate the new mechanism. The modeled fiber-pullout behavior is
   used in a scale-linking model to compute the crack bridging
   (sigma-delta) relation of HSHDC, which is also empirically verified
   through single-crack tests. The sigma-delta relation of HSHDC satisfies
   the micromechanics-based necessary strength and energy conditions of
   steady-state flat crack propagation that prevent localized fracture. The
   microscale investigation of HSHDC in this research thus demonstrates the
   rational basis for its design combining both high compressive strength
   and high tensile ductility.}},

Abstract = {{Tensile stress develops as early as upon final setting in concrete if
   shrinkage deformation due to thermal or hygral changes is restrained
   either externally or internally. Quantifying such stress and the
   associated cracking potential in concrete members is a difficult talc
   due to many factors involved, such as creep and stress relaxation,
   tensile strength development, and the combined thermal and hygral
   effects. In this study, the early-age tensile stress development and
   cracking potential were investigated on cement paste and concrete with
   and without slag cement for different water-cementitious material ratios
   (w/cm). A method is proposed for evaluating early-age cracking potential
   based on experimental results and numerical simulations. It was found
   that cracking potential is closely related to the shrinkage rate rather
   than the shrinkage magnitude, confirming the findings of other studies.
   A unique relationship was found to exist between the shrinkage rate and
   cracking time for the cement paste studied. The cracking time was
   expressed as a function of the relative humidity (RH) drop rate and the
   aggregate content of a concrete mixture based on a relationship between
   mixture shrinkage and RH established previously. It was found that a
   high RH drop rate increases cracking potential. Concrete containing an
   aggregate content of 50\% or less is highly sensitive to cracking, and
   thus is crucial for the cracking potential of the outer layer of
   concrete exposed to the environment without appropriate curing. This
   study proposes a new methodology for evaluating cracking potential,
   which has implications for mitigating early-age cracking in concrete
   members.}},

Abstract = {{Since the advent of work-hour limitations for surgical trainees, medical
   faculties have been concerned by inadequacies in two areas of resident
   training programs: operating room experience, which residents need to
   develop competence and confidence during surgery, and continuity of
   patient care, which engenders in residents a sense of responsibility and
   accountability. Previous operations research literature on resident
   scheduling models has discussed the development of mathematical
   programming models that assign residents to rotations or shifts;
   however, this literature has neglected the educational component. In
   this work, we frame the problem from an educational perspective, and we
   also describe the mathematical details behind several ideas and analyses
   in the medical literature. In addition, we present the patient
   assignment system, which we piloted at a large academic medical center,

Abstract = {{A high-order (up to 6th order) Navier-Stokes solver is coupled with a

   high-fidelity aeroelastic solver is applied to the investigation of
   rigid, moderately flexible and highly flexible rectangular wings
   undergoing a pure plunging motion. Comparisons of the computed results
   with available experimental measurements demonstrate good agreement. A
   description of the complex interaction between the unsteady aerodynamics
   and the flexible wing structural dynamics is given. Connections between
   the results of this analysis and enhanced loads for the moderately
   flexible wing are made. Results presented suggest that an optimum amount
   of flexibility exists for the case of a plunging wing and is associated
   with wing motions where the wing tip deflection and wing root motion are

Abstract = {{The two-dimensional water entry and exit of a body whose shape varies in
   time in a prescribed way is investigated through analytical and
   numerical modelling. For this purpose, an analytical model has been
   developed which extends the modified Logvinovich model of water impact
   to bodies with time-varying shape. A modified von Karman approach has
   been developed to describe the exit stage, and a rational derivation of
   the water exit model which is in use in offshore engineering is
   presented. CFD simulations are used to assess the accuracy of the
   analytical model. Several case studies of water entry and exit are
   presented. The analytical model provides very good force predictions
   during the entry stage in all cases, but the accuracy of the model in
   the exit stage depends on the maximum penetration depth. In particular,
   the appearance of high fluid forces on the body directed downward in
   both the entry and exit stages is remarkable. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Quasi-steady response of free-to-pivot flat plates in hover}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{337-355}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Using force measurements and flow visualization in a water tunnel, we
   consider motions of rigid flat plates with square edges free to pivot
   about the leading edge between incidence angles of +/- 45 degrees. The
   plate's leading edge undergoes a prescribed periodic rectilinear
   translation. During most of the translation semi-stroke, the plate rests
   against its incidence limiter to produce a positive angle of attack;
   this reverses on the opposite semi-stroke, producing a motion akin to
   normal-hover with delayed rotation. Three aspect ratios are considered:
   a nominally 2D, or wall-to-wall plate spanning the tunnel test section,
   and plates of aspect ratios 3.4 and 5.5. Reynolds number effects in the
   range of 10 000-31 000 were not found to be significant. Aerodynamic
   force coefficient history was found to be aspect-ratio invariant,
   despite difference in flowfield evolution in the wake, and the force
   coefficients magnitude decreased for decreasing motion amplitudes. Flow
   visualization gives qualitative evidence for leading-edge and
   trailing-edge vortices, but no evidence was found of leading edge vortex
   stability or for contribution of vortices to aerodynamic loads, for
   sinusoidal or nonsinusoidal imposed motions of the plate. No evidence is
   found that the vortex system in the wake interacts with the plate during
   or after semi-stroke reversal. The main operative parameter governing
   aerodynamic force history is the ratio of semi-stroke amplitude to plate
   chord. Especially for the larger semi-stroke to chord ratios,
   aerodynamic response during the translational phase of motion is nearly
   quasi-steady, with decay in both thrust and force opposing the motion,
   in proceeding along each semi-stroke. The rotational phase of each
   semi-stroke is dominated by a loads spike as the plate approaches its
   incidence limiter. This spike largely disappears when the free-to-pivot
   plate is replaced with one with a prescribed rotational history. These
   findings offer favorable implications for analysis of flapping-wings
   using quasi-steady blade element models. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{This paper builds on previous self-healing engineered cementitious
   composites (ECC) research by allowing ECC to heal outdoors, in the
   natural environment, under random and sometimes extreme environmental
   conditions. Development of an ECC material that can heal itself in the
   natural environment could lower infrastructure maintenance costs and
   allow for more sustainable development in the future by increasing
   service life and decreasing the amount of resources and energy needed
   for repairs. Determining to what extent current ECC materials self-heal
   in the natural environment is the first step in the development of an
   ECC that can completely heal itself when exposed to everyday
   environmental conditions. This study monitored outdoor ECC specimens for
   one year using resonant frequency (RF) and mechanical reloading to
   determine the rate and extent of self-healing in the natural
   environment. It was found that the level of RF, stiffness, and first
   cracking strength recovery increased as the duration of natural
   environment exposure increased. For specimens that underwent multiple
   damage cycles, it was found that the level of recovery was highly
   dependent on the average temperature and amount of precipitation between
   each damage event. However, RF, stiffness, and first cracking strength
   recovery data for specimens that underwent multiple loading cycles
   suggest that self-healing functionality can be maintained under multiple
   damage events.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of crystalline polymorphs and their quantitation has
   become an integral part of the preclinical drug development process.
   Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the rapid identification
   of phases of pharmaceuticals. In the present work we demonstrate the use
   of low wavenumber Raman vibrational spectroscopy (including phonon
   measurement) for discrimination among polymorphs. A total of 10
   polymorphic pharmaceuticals were employed to conduct a critical
   assessment. Raman scattering in the low-frequency region (10-400
   cm(-1)), which includes crystal lattice vibrations, has been analyzed,
   and the results indicate lattice phonon Raman scattering can be used for
   rapid discrimination of polymorphic phases with additional
   discriminating power compared to conventional collection strategies.
   Moreover structural insight and conformational changes can be detected
   with this approach.}},

Abstract = {{Wound healing is regulated by temporally and spatially restricted
   patterns of growth factor signaling, but there are few delivery vehicles
   capable of the ``on-demand{''} release necessary for recapitulating
   these patterns. Recently we described a perfluorocarbon double emulsion
   that selectively releases a protein payload upon exposure to ultrasound
   through a process known as acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV). In this
   study, we describe a delivery system composed of fibrin hydrogels doped
   with growth factor-loaded double emulsion for applications in tissue
   regeneration. Release of immunoreactive basic fibroblast growth factor
   (bFGF) from the composites increased up to 5-fold following ADV and
   delayed release was achieved by delaying exposure to ultrasound.
   Releasates of ultrasound-treated materials significantly increased the
   proliferation of endothelial cells compared to sham controls, indicating
   that the released bFGF was bioactive. ADV also triggered changes in the
   ultrastructure and mechanical properties of the fibrin as bubble
   formation and consolidation of the fibrin in ultrasound-treated
   composites were accompanied by up to a 22-fold increase in shear
   stiffness. ADV did not reduce the viability of cells suspended in
   composite scaffolds. These results demonstrate that an acoustic
   droplet-hydrogel composite could have broad utility in promoting wound
   healing through on-demand control of growth factor release and/or
   scaffold architecture. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{The problem of estimation of density functionals like entropy and mutual
   information has received much attention in the statistics and
   information theory communities. A large class of estimators of
   functionals of the probability density suffer from the curse of
   dimensionality, wherein the mean squared error decays increasingly
   slowly as a function of the sample size T as the dimension d of the
   samples increases. In particular, the rate is often glacially slow of
   order O(T-gamma/d), where gamma > 0 is a rate parameter. Examples of
   such estimators include kernel density estimators, k-nearest neighbor
   (k-NN) density estimators, k-NN entropy estimators, intrinsic dimension
   estimators, and other examples. In this paper, we propose a weighted
   affine combination of an ensemble of such estimators, where optimal
   weights can be chosen such that the weighted estimator converges at a
   much faster dimension invariant rate of O(T-1). Furthermore, we show
   that these optimal weights can be determined by solving a convex
   optimization problem which can be performed offline and does not require
   training data. We illustrate the superior performance of our weighted
   estimator for two important applications: 1) estimating the Panter-Dite
   distortion-rate factor; and 2) estimating the Shannon entropy for
   testing the probability distribution of a random sample.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a dynamic programming (DP)-based framework for
   simultaneously optimizing the charging and power management of a plug-in
   hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). These two optimal control problems
   relate to activities of the PHEV on the electric grid (i.e., charging)
   and on the road (i.e., power management). The proposed framework solves
   these two problems simultaneously to avoid loss of optimality resulting
   from solving them separately. The framework furnishes optimal
   trajectories of PHEV states and control inputs over a 24-h period. We
   demonstrate the framework for 24-h scenarios with two driving trips and
   different power grid generation mixes. The results show that addressing
   the aforementioned optimization problems simultaneously can elucidate
   valuable insights. For example, for the chosen daily driving scenario,
   grid generation mixes, and optimization objective, it is shown that it
   is not always optimal to completely charge a battery before each driving
   trip. In addition, reduction in CO2 resulting from the synergistic
   interaction of PHEVs with an electric grid containing a significant
   amount of wind power is studied. The main contribution of this paper to
   the literature is a framework that makes it possible to evaluate
   trade-offs between charging and on-road power management decisions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The high throughput size sorting of particles in liquid suspensions is
   of interest for a variety of microanalytical and micromanufacturing
   applications. Hollow glass cenospheres of various diameters ranging from
   5 to 200 mu m are sorted according to size by evaporation of isopropyl
   alcohol droplets on an unpatterned glass substrate. By raising the
   temperature of the glass substrate, a stable Marangoni convection is
   developed inside the droplet. At a substrate temperature of 55 degrees
   C, more of the larger spheres (150-200 mu m) are deposited near the
   droplet center, but smaller spheres < 50 mu m are found everywhere
   throughout the dried region. Better sorting is observed when the
   temperature of the substrate is above the boiling point of the liquid.
   When the substrate temperature is 85 degrees C, higher than the boiling
   point of IPA, most of the spheres < 50 mu m are transported close to the
   droplet edge. In the center of the dried pattern obtained from a 0.5 mu
   l droplet, the spheres with > 150 mu m diameter outnumber those with <
   50 mu m diameter by 6x. The deposited spheres remain attached to the
   substrate surface when dry. The self-assembled nature of this drying
   pattern results in size sorting.}},

Title = {{The effect of texture on stress-induced martensite formation in

Abstract = {{An experimental study was performed to investigate the effect of texture
   on stress-induced martensitic phase transformation in the shape memory
   alloy (SMA) nickel-titanium (Nitinol). Thin sheet specimens of Nitinol
   were examined under uniaxial tensile loading using three-dimensional
   digital image correlation in order to spatially and temporally track
   strain localization indicative of martensitic transformation. Tensile
   specimens were fabricated along directions oriented 0 degrees (RD), 45
   degrees, and 90 degrees (TD) to the rolling direction of the sheet and
   subjected to 50 cycles at prescribed strain rates of P (epsilon) over
   dot(g) = 10(-4); 10(-3), and 10(-2) s(-1). It was found that upon
   loading, specimens unfavorably oriented for transformation (TD
   specimens) nucleated a greater number of deformation bands due to a
   smaller difference between nucleation and propagation stresses, and also
   accommodated less axial strain inside the band and more axial strain
   outside the band. The unfavorable (TD) specimens also exhibited a
   stronger cycle-to-cycle similarity in the strain accommodated inside the
   deformation band, which has important implications for the design of SMA
   structures for fatigue applications. Finally, the (primarily martensite)
   region of the deformation band(s) consistently showed significantly
   stronger cycle-to-cycle similarity than the (primarily austenite) region
   outside the band(s), regardless of specimen texture.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical approach is developed to describe the effect of surface
   irregularities on the van der Waals adhesion energy between macroscopic
   bodies. The approach allows for computing the energies of dispersive
   interactions between a body, bounded by a periodically modulated
   surface, and a point-like as well as a semi-infinite planar adherent.
   Furthermore, the model is employed to investigate dispersive interaction
   between two semi-infinite bodies with periodically modulated surfaces,
   separated by a vacuum gap, in which case the effect of misalignment
   between periodic profiles on the interaction energy was theoretically
   analyzed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A liquid filled, silica micro-tube with a low refractive index material

   sensitivity. Its unique coupling phenomenon has been analyzed and
   utilized to boost the device's refractive index sensitivity to 967
   nm/Refractive Index Unit (RIU). Through optimization of the coupling
   strength between the two micro-resonators, further improvement in
   refractive index sensitivity up to 1100 nm/RIU has been predicted. This
   mode coupling strategy allows us to design robust, thick-walled
   micro-tube sensors with ultra-high sensitivity which is useful in
   practical biochemical sensing applications. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Development of green engineered cementitious composites using iron ore
   tailings as aggregates}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{757-764}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Micro-silica sand is often used as fine aggregate in the production of
   Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC), which is a class of
   ultra-ductile fiber-reinforced cement-based structural materials.
   However, high cost and limited availability of micro-silica sand creates
   an obstacle for widespread application of ECC in civil infrastructure.
   To overcome this limitation, the present study explores the feasibility
   of using iron ore tailings (IOTs) as cheaper and more environmentally
   friendly alternative aggregates without sacrificing the ductile
   mechanical performance of standard ECC. Influences of the size of IOTs
   on plastic viscosity of fresh ECC mortar, and on tensile properties and
   fiber dispersion in composites were experimentally investigated. At two
   levels of fly ash/cement ratio, performance of ECC with IOTs under
   direct tension and compression was investigated. The results show that
   ECC with IOTs as aggregates can attain tensile and compressive
   properties comparable to ECC with typically-used micro-silica sand,
   provided that the size of IOTs used is in the appropriate range which
   facilitates good fiber dispersion. Thus, the feasibility of using
   industrial solid waste-iron ore tailings as aggregates in the
   development of highly ductile and green ECC was established. (C) 2013
