Abstract = {{To cope with the growing amount of debris in the Earth orbit, spacecraft
   collision avoidance capabilities are necessary. In this paper, we
   propose an approach to debris avoidance maneuvering based on the use of
   safe positively invariant sets in order to steer the spacecraft, under
   closed-loop control, around a piece of debris. A connectivity graph of
   forced equilibria is computed based on the overlap of these invariant
   sets, and a graph search algorithm is then implmented in order to find
   the shortest path around the debris. Fast growth distance computation is
   employed for on-board real-time applicability. Simulation results are
   presented that illustrate this approach.}},

Abstract = {{The Stochastic Computational Element (SCE) uses streams of random bits
   (stochastic bits streams) to perform computation with conventional
   digital logic gates. It can guarantee reliable computation using
   unreliable devices. In stochastic computing, the linear Finite State
   Machine (FSM) can be used to implement some sophisticated functions,
   such as the exponentiation and tanh functions, more efficiently than
   combinational logic. However, a general approach about how to synthesize
   a linear FSM-based SCE for a target function has not been available. In
   this paper, we will introduce three properties of the linear FSM used in
   stochastic computing and demonstrate a general approach to synthesize a
   linear FSM-based SCE for a target function. Experimental results show
   that our approach produces circuits that are much more tolerant of soft
   errors than deterministic implementations, while the area-delay product
   of the circuits are less than that of deterministic implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Whether it happens through malware or through phishing, loss of one's
   online identity is a real and present danger. While many attackers seek
   credentials to realize financial gain, an analysis of the compromised
   accounts at our own institutions reveals that perpetrators often steal
   university credentials to gain free and unfettered access to
   information. This nontraditional motivation for credential theft puts a
   special burden on the academic institutions that provide these accounts.
   In this paper, we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of
   a system for safeguarding academic accounts and resources called the
   University Credential Abuse Auditing System (UCAAS). We evaluate UCAAS
   at two major research universities with tens of thousands of user
   accounts and millions of login events during a two-week period. We show
   the UCAAS to be useful in reducing this burden, having helped the
   university security teams identify a total of 125 compromised accounts
   with zero false positives during the trail.}},

Abstract = {{Although transistor density continues to increase, voltage scaling has
   stalled and thus power density is increasing each technology generation.
   Particularly in mobile devices, which have limited cooling options,
   these trends lead to a utilization wall in which sustained chip
   performance is limited primarily by power rather than area. However,
   many mobile applications do not demand sustained performance; rather
   they comprise short bursts of computation in response to sporadic user
   activity.
   To improve responsiveness for such applications, this paper explores
   activating otherwise powered-down cores for sub-second bursts of intense
   parallel computation. The approach exploits the concept of computational
   sprinting, in which a chip temporarily exceeds its sustainable thermal
   power budget to provide instantaneous throughput, after which the chip
   must return to nominal operation to cool down. To demonstrate the
   feasibility of this approach, we analyze the thermal and electrical
   characteristics of a smart-phone-like system that nominally operates a
   single core (similar to 1W peak), but can sprint with up to 16 cores for
   hundreds of milliseconds. We describe a thermal design that incorporates
   phase-change materials to provide thermal capacitance to enable such
   sprints. We analyze image recognition kernels to show that parallel
   sprinting has the potential to achieve the task response time of a 16W
   chip within the thermal constraints of a 1W mobile platform.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new nonlinear generalization of linear canonical
   correlation analysis (LCCA) is derived. This framework, called measure
   transformed canonical correlation analysis (MTCCA), applies LCCA to the
   considered pair of random vectors after transformation of their joint
   probability distribution. The proposed transform is structured by a pair
   of nonnegative functions called the MT-functions. It preserves
   statistical independence and maps the joint probability distribution
   into a set of joint probability measures on the joint observation space.
   Specification of MT-functions in the exponential family, leads to MTCCA,
   which, in contrast to LCCA, is capable of detecting nonlinear
   dependencies. In the paper, MTCCA is illustrated for recovery of a
   nonlinear system with known structure, and for construction of networks
   that analyze long-term associations between companies traded in the

   balance current. Energy can be directly transferred from higher voltage
   cells to lower voltage cells. The balancing circuit can achieve ideal
   balance results as long as the multi-winding transformer has ideal
   symmetry. Other circuit components' asymmetry would only affect the
   balance speed. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness. A
   circuit for balancing a four-cell battery group is tested. The

Abstract = {{Lecture demonstrations can be a significant aid to learning, when
   coupled with appropriate teaching methods and conceptual knowledge.
   However, in-class experimental demonstrations of core concepts in
   nanotechnology, such as self-assembly of molecular systems, is
   exceptionally challenging under poorly controlled classroom conditions.
   In this work, I demonstrate the use of soap bubbles as easily
   visualized, accessible and relatively robust examples of molecular
   systems, that are already familiar to students, yet can be used to
   illustrate complex principles of self-assembly. Utilizing dynamic soap
   bubble sculptures, this work illustrates a simplified framework within
   which to teach molecular self-assembly in nanoeducation outreach
   programs at the secondary school level. Student learning and interest in
   nanoscience was assessed via an ad hoc survey to determine the
   suitability and effectiveness of soap bubbles as learning tools for this
   target audience. The results demonstrate that even academically strong
   students at the secondary level had largely not considered the link
   between molecules and soap bubbles, but described a high level of
   intrinsic interest in the subject material. Self-assessed levels of
   concept comprehension were high, and students described an increased
   interest in pursuing studies in the physical sciences and specifically
   within nanotechnology.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the behavior of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
   (DOPC) in high-temperature water at 175, 200, 225, and 350 C. DOPC
   hydrolyzed to give oleic acid and a number of phosphorus-containing
   products. The hydrolysis was catalyzed by oleic and phosphoric acids,
   which were also reaction products. DOPC formed 1-acyl and 2-acyl
   lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) along with oleic acid as primary
   products. LPC subsequently formed other phosphorus-containing
   intermediates, which finally led to phosphoric acid as the ultimate
   P-containing product. At 350 C, phosphoric acid and oleic acid were the
   only products observed. We observed an ester of oleic acid and glycerol
   (9-octadecenoic-2,3-dihydroxypropyl ester), which likely formed via the
   hydrolysis of LPC. A reaction network is proposed to explain the
   formation of the observed products. A quantitative kinetics model based
   on the proposed pathways was consistent with the experimental data.}},

Title = {{Live-cell subcellular measurement of cell stiffness using a
   microengineered stretchable micropost array membrane}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1289-1298}},
Abstract = {{Forces are increasingly recognized as major regulators of cell structure
   and function, and the mechanical properties of cells, such as cell
   stiffness, are essential to the mechanisms by which cells sense forces,
   transmit them to the cell interior or to other cells, and transduce them
   into chemical signals that impact a spectrum of cellular responses. Here
   we reported a new whole-cell cell stiffness measurement technique with a
   subcellular spatial resolution. This technique was based on a novel cell
   stretching device that allowed for quantitative control and real-time
   measurements of mechanical stimuli and cellular biomechanical responses.
   Our strategy involved a microfabricated array of silicone elastomeric
   microposts integrated onto a stretchable elastomeric membrane. Using a
   computer-controlled vacuum, this micropost array membrane (mPAM) was
   activated to apply equibiaxial cell stretching forces to adherent cells
   attached on the tops of the microposts. The micropost top positions
   before and after mPAM stretches were recorded using fluorescence
   microscopy and further utilized to quantify local cell stretching forces
   and cell area increments. A robust computation scheme was developed and
   implemented for subcellular quantifications of cell stiffness using the
   data of local cell stretching forces and cell area increments generated
   from mPAM cell stretch assays. Our cell stiffness studies using the mPAM
   revealed strong positive correlations among cell stiffness, cellular
   traction force, and cell spread area, and illustrated the important
   functional roles of actin polymerization and myosin II-mediated
   cytoskeleton contractility in regulating cell stiffness. Collectively,
   our work reported a new approach for whole-cell stiffness measurements
   with a subcellular spatial resolution, which would help likely explain
   the complex biomechanical functions and force-sensing mechanisms of
   cells and design better materials for cell and tissue engineering and
   other applications in vivo.}},

Pages = {{A1838-A1843}},
Abstract = {{We show that the resistance to fracture in electrode materials of Li
   batteries can be altered substantially by varying the chemical potential
   of Li, or equivalently, the open circuit voltage of a battery (V-cell),
   due to high Li mobility. Based on a thermodynamic analysis using input
   from first-principles electronic structure calculations, we determine
   the dependence of the energy (w(f)) and critical stress (sigma(f)) of
   decohesion on the cell voltage of Li intercalation compounds. We
   demonstrate that w(f) can decrease, increase or stay constant, with
   V-cell, depending on how the local Li concentration changes as new crack
   surfaces form. We show that chemically induced crack instabilities can
   occur when V-cell drives phase transitions within the decohering region,
   resulting in a discontinuous increase in crack separation and a dramatic
   drop in the maximal stress for decohesion. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical

Volume = {{159}},

Pages = {{H864-H870}},
Abstract = {{We use microkinetic modeling to demonstrate that deviations from ideal
   Tafel kinetics, which assume a linear relationship between overpotential
   and log-current, are an inherent property of multi-step heterogeneous
   electrocatalytic reactions. We show that in general, deviations from
   ideal Tafel behavior can often be attributed to a simultaneous increase
   in the rate of the rate-limiting elementary step and a change in the
   number of available active sites on the electrode as overpotential is
   induced. Our analysis shows that in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
   on Pt electrodes, which exhibits nonlinear Tafel behavior, changing
   electrode potential affects not only the rate-limiting step (the initial
   electron transfer to molecular oxygen), but also the concentration of
   surface intermediates-mainly OH and H2O. Based on comparison of measured
   and predicted changes in Tafel slope (as well as pH dependence), we show
   that alternative interpretations of the non-ideal Tafel behavior of ORR
   on Pt, such as changes in rate-limiting step or adsorbate repulsion
   effects, are inconsistent with the observed ORR kinetics. (C) 2012 The

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3-4, SI}},

Abstract = {{Statistical uncertainty is inherent to any Monte Carlo simulation of
   radiation transport problems. In space-angle-frequency independent
   radiative transfer calculations, the uncertainty in the solution is
   entirely due to random sampling of source photon emission times. We have
   developed a modification to the Implicit Monte Carlo algorithm that
   eliminates noise due to sampling of the emission time of source photons.
   In problems that are independent of space, angle, and energy, the new
   algorithm generates a smooth solution, while a standard implicit Monte
   Carlo solution is noisy. For space- and angle-dependent problems, the
   new algorithm exhibits reduced noise relative to standard implicit Monte
   Carlo in some cases, and comparable noise in all other cases. The
   improvements are limited to short time scales; over long time scales,
   noise due to random sampling of spatial and angular variables tends to
   dominate the noise reduction from the new algorithm.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{9207-9213}},
Abstract = {{Monodispersed HfO2 nanoparticles can be readily prepared at room
   temperature by the ammonia catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation of
   hafnium(IV) tert-butoxide in the presence of a surfactant. The
   nanoparticles are faceted with an average diameter of about 4 nm. The
   as-synthesized amorphous nanoparticles crystallize upon post-synthesis
   heat treatment. The crystallization temperature of the nanoparticles can
   be controlled by adjusting the annealing atmosphere. The HfO2
   nanoparticles have a narrow size distribution, large specific surface
   area and the thermal conductivity of pressed pellets is drastically
   reduced compared to the bulk counterpart. The specific surface area was
   about 239 m(2) g(-1) on as-prepared samples while those annealed at 500
   degrees C have a surface area of 221 m(2) g(-1) showing that the heat
   treatment produced no significant increase in particle size.
   Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further confirmed that the
   nanoparticles annealed at different temperatures while X-ray diffraction
   studies of the crystallized nanoparticles revealed that HfO2
   nanoparticles were monoclinic in structure. High density pellets of the
   as-synthesized HfO2 nanoparticles were obtained, using both spark plasma
   sintering and uniaxial hot pressing, and their thermal conductivity was
   measured in the temperature range from 300 to 775 K. A large reduction
   of the thermal conductivity was observed for HfO2 nanoparticles as
   compared to that of bulk HfO2. The decrease in thermal conductivity is
   discussed in terms of the microstructure of the compacted samples. The
   synthetic procedure used in this work can be readily modified for large
   scale production of monodispersed HfO2 nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Physical factors in the local cellular microenvironment, including cell
   shape and geometry, matrix mechanics, external mechanical forces, and

   adhesions and the force balance between intracellular cytoskeletal
   contractility and the resistant forces originated from the extracellular
   matrix. Importantly, these mechanotransduction processes can couple with
   many other potent growth-factor-mediated signaling pathways to regulate
   stem cell fate. Different bioengineering tools and microscale/nanoscale
   devices have been successfully developed to engineer the physical
   aspects of the cellular microenvironment for stem cells, and these tools

Title = {{Retrieval of Parameters for Three-Layer Media with Nonsmooth Interfaces
   for Subsurface Remote Sensing}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{A solution to the inverse problem for a three-layer medium with
   nonsmooth boundaries, representing a large class of natural subsurface
   structures, is developed in this paper using simulated radar data. The
   retrieval of the layered medium parameters is accomplished as a
   sequential nonlinear optimization starting from the top layer and
   progressively characterizing the layers below. The optimization process
   is achieved by an iterative technique built around the solution of the
   forward scattering problem. The forward scattering process is formulated
   by using the extended boundary condition method (EBCM) and constructing
   reflection and transmission matrices for each interface. These matrices
   are then combined into the generalized scattering matrix for the entire
   system, from which radar scattering coefficients are then computed. To
   be efficiently utilized in the inverse problem, the forward scattering
   model is simulated over a wide range of unknowns to obtain a complete
   set of subspace-based equivalent closed-form models that relate radar
   backscattering coefficients to the sought-for parameters including
   dielectric constants of each layer and separation of the layers. The
   inversion algorithm is implemented as a modified
   conjugate-gradient-based nonlinear optimization. It is shown that this
   technique results in accurate retrieval of surface and subsurface
   parameters, even in the presence of noise.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are well-suited to a variety of tasks
   that are dangerous or repetitive for humans to perform. Despite recent
   advances, UGVs still suffer from reliability issues, and human operation
   failures have been identified as one root cause of UGV system failure.
   However, most literature relevant to UGV reliability does not address
   the effects of human errors or the user interface. Our previous work
   investigated the issue of user situational awareness and sense of
   presence in the robot workspace by implementing a Mixed Reality
   interface featuring a first-person video feed with an Augmented Reality
   overlay and a third-person Virtual Reality display. The interface was
   evaluated in a series of user tests in which users manually controlled a
   UGV with a manipulator arm using traditional input modalities including
   a computer mouse, keyboard and gamepad. In this study, we learned that
   users found it challenging to mentally map commands from the manual
   inputs to the robot arm behavior. Also, switching between control
   modalities seemed to add to the cognitive load during teleoperation
   tasks. A master-slave style manual controller can provide an intuitive
   one-to-one mapping from user input to robot pose, and has the potential
   to improve both operator situational awareness for teleoperation tasks
   and decrease mission completion time. This paper describes the design
   and implementation of a teleoperated UGV with a Mixed Reality
   visualization interface and a master-slave controller that is suitable
   for teleoperated mobile manipulation tasks.}},

Abstract = {{A metal-organic framework (MOF)-based catalyst W-Cu-BTC is designed by
   hybridizing highly active W ions into Cu-3(BTC)(2)(H2O)(3) (also known
   as Cu-BTC or HKUST-1, BTC = 1,3,5-tricarboxylate benzene) frameworks
   based on density functional (DFT) calculations. We show that the hybrid
   W-Cu node plays a pivotal role in activating CO2 according to frontier
   molecular orbital theory. In contrast to the Lewis-acid nature of open
   metal sites in most MOFs, the exposed W ion in W-Cu-BTC is identified as
   a Lewis-base site, evidenced by the substantial electron donation from W
   ion to CO2. Kinetically, the linear CO2 molecule can be readily bent by
   forming a CO2-W complex after overcoming a negligible activation barrier
   of 0.09 eV. In addition, we present calculated infrared spectra (IR) and
   X-Ray spectra (XPS) for reference in future experimental studies.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of matrix strength on the tensile behavior of Fiber
   Reinforced Cement Composites {[}FRCC] is investigated. The test
   parameters included four cementitious matrices with compressive strength
   of 28 MPa (4 ksi) {[}M1], 56 MPa (8 ksi) {[}M2], 84 MPa (12 ksi) {[}M3]
   and 190 MPa (28 ksi) {[}M4], respectively, two types of high strength
   deformed steel fibers, Hooked {[}H-] and Twisted {[}T-] fibers, and two
   volume fractions of fibers, 1\% and 2\%. It is observed that while the
   first cracking strength, post cracking strength and energy absorption
   capacity of FRCC are strongly influenced by the compressive strength of
   the matrix their strain capacity at peak stress and cracking behavior
   are not as much affected. While both H- and T- fibers led to improved
   performance when the matrix strength was increased, T- fibers take
   better advantage of higher strength matrices. A post-cracking tensile
   strength exceeding 15 MPa at a peak strain of 0.5\% was achieved by
   using 2\% T- fibers with an ultra-high strength matrix (M4).}},

   frequency measurements and uniaxial tensile tests were used to quantify
   the rate and robustness of self-healing, while photo documentation was
   used to obtain visual evidence of self-healing products. It was found
   that there was a significant recovery of resonant frequency and
   stiffness in the damaged specimens after they were exposed to the
   natural environment. Specimens were able to recover up to 90\% of their
   original, pre-damaged, resonant frequency values and up to 31\% and 68\%
   of their initial stiffness after one and three months of exposure. Photo
   documentation also showed self-healing in cracks up to 20 gm in width.

Abstract = {{The design of coupling or ``link{''} beams connecting structural walls
   in earthquake-resistant construction requires the use of intricate
   diagonal and transverse reinforcement detailing to ensure adequate
   strength, stiffness and energy dissipation during an earthquake event.
   The tensile strain-hardening behavior exhibited by high-performance
   fiber reinforced concretes (HPFRCs), along with their compression
   behavior that resembles that of well-confined concrete, led the senior
   writers to consider their use as a means to simplify the required
   reinforcement detailing in coupling beams, while leading to comparable
   or even enhanced seismic performance. Short coupling beams with a
   span-to-depth ratio (l(n)/h) of 1.0 were first investigated. Test
   results showed that HPFRC provides confinement to the diagonal
   reinforcement and increases coupling beam shear strength and drift
   capacity. This allows for a substantial reduction in both diagonal and
   confinement reinforcement without compromising deformation capacity. A
   follow-up study on coupling beams with l(n)/h = 1.75 showed that a
   ductile flexural mechanism with high damage tolerance can be achieved
   through the use of HPFRC. A precast scheme with a short embedment length
   was shown to effectively anchor the beam into the wall without
   interfering with the wall reinforcement. Also, an HPFRC mixture with
   high-strength (2300 MPa) hooked steel fibers in a 1.5\% volume fraction
   was found to be the most promising in terms of structural performance,
   economy and ease of construction. In order to cover the range of l(n)/h
   ratios common in practice, additional studies were conducted on more
   slender coupling beams, with l(n)/h = 2.75 and 3.3. It was shown that
   slender precast HPFRC coupling beams can develop a high drift capacity
   and damage tolerance, even when diagonal reinforcement is eliminated.
   The results from this work thus provide structural engineers and
   contractors a viable design alternative for use in earthquake-resistant
   coupled wall construction.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concretes (UHP-FRC) can be
   designed to resist increasing tensile loading after first matrix
   cracking, which results from strain hardening tensile characteristics
   accompanied by multiple cracking. Previous investigations carried out
   under static loading conditions have clearly shown that matrix
   composition, fiber material and geometry as well as fiber volume
   fraction and fiber orientation influence the strain hardening tensile
   behavior. This paper describes research that was conducted to study the
   direct tensile behavior of UHP-FRC loaded at various speeds. A hydraulic
   test machine was used to apply load up to 10(3) times faster than static
   loading, i.e. up to a strain rate of (epsilon) over dot = 0.1 s(-1). The
   test setup was designed to permit reliable measurement of direct tension
   test results at the different loading speeds considered, taking into
   consideration a reasonable gage length for multiple crack development
   while minimizing the inertial effects associated with the specimen and
   attached measurement equipment. The strain rate dependent tensile
   behavior is analyzed in terms of peak strength, strain at peak strength,
   hardening modulus and energy absorption capacity prior to softening. The
   results show the strain rate sensitivity of each of these parameters at
   fiber volume fractions of 2, 2.5 and 3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative analysis of the output of processes and molecular
   interactions within a single cell is highly critical to the advancement
   of accurate disease screening and personalized medicine. Optical
   detection is one of the most broadly adapted measurement methods in
   biological and clinical assays and serves cellular phenotyping.
   Recently, microfluidics has obtained increasing attention due to several
   advantages, such as small sample and reagent volumes, very high
   throughput, and accurate flow control in the spatial and temporal
   domains. Optofluidics, which is the attempt to integrate optics with
   microfluidics, shows great promise to enable on-chip phenotypic
   measurements with high precision, sensitivity, specificity, and
   simplicity. This paper reviews the most recent developments of
   optofluidic technologies for cellular phenotyping optical detection.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to use a pressure sensor to measure the force
   distribution and contact area of the hand when gripping, pushing, and
   pulling a cylinder. Data was collected from 10 subjects with no hand
   impairments and from 1 subject with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Subjects
   grasped an aluminum cylinder wrapped with a Tekscan pressure sensor and
   performed each trial at 25\%, 50\%, and 100\% maximum voluntary
   exertion. A relationship was found between increasing exertion and
   increasing hand area with increasing hand contact area. The force
   distribution maps showed the thenar region of the hand exerts the most
   force during pushing while the metacarpal joint line exerts the highest
   force during pulling. The third and fourth phalange were found to exert
   the highest phalange force during gripping. The force distribution maps
   from the RA subject showed higher thumb forces and distal phalange
   forces, relative to the entire phalange, compared to the non-impaired
   subjects. This suggests that the RA subject compensates for the lack of
   phalange function with the regions of the hand that still function.
   Future studies should sample individuals with a larger hand area range
   and sample more individuals with RA.}},

Title = {{Calibrated asymmetric surrogate losses}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{958-992}},
Abstract = {{Surrogate losses underlie numerous state-of-the-art binary
   classification algorithms, such as support vector machines and boosting.
   The impact of a surrogate loss on the statistical performance of an
   algorithm is well-understood in symmetric classification settings, where
   the misclassification costs are equal and the loss is a margin loss. In
   particular, classification-calibrated losses are known to imply
   desirable properties such as consistency. While numerous efforts have
   been made to extend surrogate loss-based algorithms to asymmetric
   settings, to deal with unequal misclassification costs or training data
   imbalance, considerably less attention has been paid to whether the
   modified loss is still calibrated in some sense. This article extends
   the theory of classification-calibrated losses to asymmetric problems.
   As in the symmetric case, it is shown that calibrated asymmetric
   surrogate losses give rise to excess risk bounds, which control the
   expected misclassification cost in terms of the excess surrogate risk.
   This theory is illustrated on the class of uneven margin losses, and the
   uneven hinge, squared error, exponential, and sigmoid losses are treated
   in detail.}},

Abstract = {{A desire to eliminate hypodermic needle in transdermal drug delivery may
   now be realized. Imaging of the skin after injection of fluorescent
   probe and biotin via the bio-ballistic technique revealed the epidermal
   and dermal layers which were stained well below 60 mu m underneath the
   abdominal skin of the guinea-pig. An extensive network of cells are
   shown in the deeper layer of the stained dermis as the distributed
   fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dose is administered by repeated
   injection via the laser-based microjet. Here, we show our method of
   laser-based microjet drug delivery is capable of breaching guinea-pig's
   skin tissue and then delivering controlled dose of drug to the targeted
   region between 10 to 400 mu m underneath the outermost layer of the
   skin. While minimizing pain and tissue damage by reducing the injection
   volume to similar to 100 nl per pulse and the microjet diameter of half
   the conventional syringe needle in 100 mu m, the optimally controlled
   delivery of liquid drug by the irradiated laser pulse is shown possible.}},

Abstract = {{Re-entry vehicles designed for space exploration are usually equipped
   with thermal protection systems made of ablative material. In order to
   properly model and predict the aerothermal environment of the vehicle,
   it is imperative to account for the gases produced by ablation
   processes. In the case of charring ablators, where an inner resin is
   pyrolyzed at a relatively low temperature, the composition of the gas
   expelled into the boundary layer is complex and may lead to thermal
   chemical reactions that cannot be captured with simple flow chemistry
   models. In order to obtain better predictions, an appropriate gas flow
   chemistry model needs to be included in the CFD calculations. Using a
   recently developed chemistry model for ablating carbon-phenolic-in-air
   species, a CFD calculation of the Stardust re-entry at 71 km is
   presented. The code used for that purpose has been designed to take
   advantage of the nature of the problem and therefore remains very
   efficient when a high number of chemical species are involved. The CFD
   result demonstrates the need for such chemistry model when modeling the
   flow field around an ablative material. Modeling of the nonequilibrium
   radiation spectra is also presented, and compared to the experimental
   data obtained during Stardust re-entry by the Echelle instrument. The
   predicted emission from the CN lines compares quite well with the
   experimental results, demonstrating the validity of the current
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{The paper considers issues and algorithmic approaches related to
   modeling and identification of Markov Chain type models for vehicle
   applications. The use of Markov Chain models in these applications is
   stimulated by their ability to reflect aggregate vehicle operating
   conditions and induce ``best on average{''} control policies based on
   application of stochastic dynamic programming and stochastic Model
   Predictive Control. A novel fuzzy encoding approach of continuous
   signals is proposed in which a signal value is simultaneously associated
   with multiple cells, and it is shown to enhance identification and
   prediction accuracy of Markov Chain type models. A computationally
   simple identification algorithm, suitable for on-board applications, is
   proposed to learn Markov Chain transition probabilities in real-time.
   Examples of real-time learning models of vehicle speed and road grade
   are reported to illustrate the overall identification approach.}},

Abstract = {{The paper illustrates the use of optimal finite horizon and receding
   horizon control techniques to generate input excitation to enhance
   parameter identification in automotive systems. Firstly, it is shown
   that a Design of Experiments (DoE) problem of determining transient
   trajectories for off-line engine parameter identification can be posed
   as an optimal control problem, where either the determinant or the trace
   of the inverse of Fisher information matrix is minimized. Then an
   approach to adaptation of parameters in transient feed-forward
   compensation algorithms is discussed. Both Fisher information matrix
   computation and parameter update law utilize output sensitivity with
   respect to parameters being identified. Finally, a receding horizon
   optimal control framework for on-line parameter identification is
   considered where through an appropriate formulation of the cost function
   being minimized, it is shown that the system can be controlled to
   maintain tracking performance, satisfy constraints, and generate
   persistent excitation for parameter identification. For illustration, we
   use throughout an example based on the identification of transient fuel
   model parameters. An additional example of fast engine steady-state
   mapping is discussed to suggest another application of the receding
   horizon approach to on-line parameter identification.}},

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{This article develops a model and analysis to provide insight into two
   effective remedies to increase supply chain resilience: (i) contracting
   with a secondary flexible backup supplier; and (ii) monitoring primary
   suppliers to obtain disruption risk information. To investigate the true
   value of these strategies, an analysis is performed under imperfect
   information concerning the disruption risks and considering a two-stage
   setting with recourse. In this setting, the firm first monitors its
   suppliers and then utilizes a recourse option subject to the limited
   quantity of a capacity reserved a priori via a contract with a flexible
   backup supplier. The firm's jointly optimal behavior is analytically
   characterized (utilizing only the information available to the firm)
   regarding two interconnected decisions: (i) the advance capacity
   investment/reservation level with a flexible backup supplier; and (ii)
   the inventory ordering policy of the underlying products from both
   primary and backup suppliers. The presented results quantify effective
   disruption risk mitigation strategies for firms and provide managerial
   insights into the value of (i) a flexible backup supplier; (ii)
   disruption risk information; (iii) a contracted recourse option; and
   (iv) flexibility in the backup system.}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces a new canonical model of worker cross-training,
   called a Fixed Task Zone Chain (FTZC), as a special type of zone-based
   cross-training and develops a methodology to employ it in U-shaped
   CONstant Work In Process (CONWIP) lines. The FTZC approach is intended
   to address lines with more stations than workers in environments where
   extensive cross-training is prohibitive. It incorporates a two-skill
   chain to cross-train one skill at each end of each zone; however, tasks
   at the interior of a zone are not cross-trained. A heuristic dynamic
   control policy is developed that maximizes the line's throughput given a
   zone structure. Some useful properties of the optimal policy are
   provided as a basis for a heuristic control policy that yields high
   throughput. The performance of an FTZC system is contingent upon the
   choice of zone structure; therefore, the zone assignment (ZonA)
   algorithm is created to design the zone structure to achieve high
   throughput levels. Sufficient conditions which guarantee that the line
   is balanceable through ZonA are derived. Benchmarking over a test suite
   supports the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic worker control
   policy as well as the ZonA algorithm, and its performance is compared
   with other paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{Heat rejection augmentation in a ventilated cavity filled partially with
   a porous medium is studied numerically using the finite-element method.
   Analyses were performed in a mixed convection heat transfer regime.
   Results were obtained using various pertinent dimensionless parameters;
   namely; the effects of the solid-to-fluid thermal conductivity ratio
   (1-100), Darcy number (10(-3) - 10(-6)), Richardson number (0.01-10),
   location of the porous layer (0.1-0.9), and width of the porous layer
   (0.1-0.9) on the streamlines, and the isotherms, average Nusselt number
   and the bulk average fluid temperature are analyzed in this
   investigation. The generalized model of the momentum equation, which is
   also known as the Forchheimer-Brinkman extended Darcy model, is employed
   in modeling the fluid motion inside the porous layer. In addition, the
   local thermal equilibrium condition was assumed to be valid for the
   range of the thermophysical parameters considered in the present
   investigation. The results of this investigation reveal that the
   location and width of the porous layer play a significant role in the
   pattern of the streamlines and isotherms within the enclosure. Moreover,
   the average Nusselt number and the bulk average fluid temperature are
   found to increase as the porous layer moves toward the exit port.
   However, the Nusselt number is found to decrease while the average
   temperature increases as the width of porous layer increases. Finally,
   the contribution of the conduction and convection heat transfer regimes
   to the overall energy transport within the enclosure revealed some
   interesting optimization scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a novel technology for low-noise un-cooled
   detection of infrared (IR) radiation using a combination of
   piezoelectric, pyroelectric, electrostrictive, and resonant effects. The
   architecture consists of a parallel array of high-Q gallium nitride
   (GaN) micro-mechanical resonators coated with an IR absorbing
   nanocomposite. The nanocomposite absorber converts the IR energy into
   heat with high efficiency. The generated heat causes a shift in
   frequency characteristics of the GaN resonators because of pyroelectric
   effect. IR detection is achieved by sensing the shift in the resonance
   frequency and amplitude of the exposed GaN resonator as compared to a
   reference resonator that is included in the array. This architecture
   offers improved signal to noise ratio compared with conventional
   pyroelectric detectors as the resonant effect reduces the background
   noise and improves sensitivity, enabling IR detection with NEDTs below 5
   mK at room temperature. GaN is chosen as the resonant material as it
   possesses high pyroelectric, electrostrictive, and piezoelectric
   coefficients and can be grown on silicon substrates for low-cost batch
   fabrication. Measured results of a GaN IR detector prototype and a
   thin-film nanocomposite IR absorber are presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Sensors for autonomous small robotic platforms must be low mass, compact
   size and low power due to the limited space. For such applications, as
   the dimensions of the structures shrink, standard machining methods are
   not suitable because of low fabrication tolerances and high cost in
   assembly. Commonly, the structures show a high degree of fabrication
   complexity due to error in alignment, air gaps between conductive parts,
   poor metal contact, inaccuracy in patterning because of non-contact
   lithography, complex assemblies of various parts, and high number of
   steps needed for construction. However, micromachining offers high
   fabrication precision, provides easy fabrication and integration with
   active devices and hence is suitable for manufacturing high MMW and
   submillimeter-wave frequency structures. A radar design compatible with
   micromachining process is developed to fabricate a Y-band high
   resolution radar structure with a slot-fed patch array antenna. A
   multi-step silicon DRIE process is developed for the fabrication of the
   waveguide structure while the slots are suspended on a thin
   oxide/nitride/oxide membrane to form the top cover of the waveguide
   trenches and the patch elements are suspended on a thin Parylene
   membrane. Gold thermocompression bonding and Parylene bonding are used
   to assemble different parts of the antenna. These processes result in a
   compact (4.5 cm x 3.5 cm x 1.5 mm) and light-weight (5 g) radar.}},

Title = {{Effects of Obesity on Seat Belt Fit}},
Journal = {{TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{364-372}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Obesity has been shown to increase the risks of some types
   of injury in crashes. One way in which obesity may increase injury risk
   is by changing the routing of the belt relative to the underlying
   skeletal structures.
   Methods: Belt fit was measured in a laboratory study of 54 men and
   women, 48 percent of whom were obese, defined by body mass index (BMI)
   of 30 kg/m(2) or greater. Test conditions included a wide range of upper
   and lower belt anchorage locations and ranges of seat height, seat
   cushion angle, and seat back angle spanning the conditions in a large
   fraction of front and rear seats in passenger cars and light trucks. In
   some conditions, foot position was restricted to simulate the typical
   situation in the second row of a small sedan.
   Results: Across individuals, an increase in BMI of 10 kg/m(2) was
   associated with a lap belt positioned 43 mm further forward and 21 mm
   higher relative to the anterior-superior iliac spines of the pelvis.
   Each 10 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was associated with an increase in lap
   belt webbing length of 130 mm. The worsening of lap belt fit with
   restricted foot position was slightly greater for obese participants.
   Obesity was associated with a more-inboard shoulder belt routing across
   a wide range of upper belt anchorage locations, and the shoulder belt
   webbing length between the D-ring and latch plate increased by an
   average of 60 mm with each 10 kg/m(2) increase in BMI.
   Discussion and Conclusions: The results suggest that obesity effectively
   introduces slack in the seat belt system by routing the belt further
   away from the skeleton. Particularly in frontal crashes, but also in
   rollovers and other scenarios, this slack will result in increased
   excursions and an increased likelihood and severity of contacts with the
   interior. The higher routing of the lap belt with respect to the pelvis
   also increases the likelihood of submarining in frontal crashes.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents measured results demonstrating an uncooled infrared
   (IR) detector based on gallium nitride (GaN) micromechanical resonators.
   GaN-based photonic detectors are typically designed to operate in the
   ultraviolet (UV) regime as the absorption spectrum of wide-band gap GaN
   peaks at a wavelength of similar to 360 nm. In contrast, the
   transduction mechanism of the device presented in this work is the
   pyroelectric perturbation of a GaN micromechanical resonator, allowing
   the detection of radiation in the IR regime. IR radiation within the
   absorption spectrum of the resonating stack material (mainly the IR
   absorber) is converted into heat causing pyroelectric charge release,
   which in turn shifts the resonant frequency via changes in the acoustic
   velocity of GaN. A thin-film IR absorber based on carbon-nanotube
   nanocomposite is proposed, which offers IR absorptivity of more than
   95\%. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a GaN resonant detector
   operated at 119 MHz, which exhibits an IR sensitivity of similar to 4
   Hz/10nW.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates brake-based path control of a passenger vehicle,
   aimed at reducing secondary collision risk following an initial impact
   in a traffic accident. Previous results from numerical optimisation
   showed that, at varying severity levels of post-impact states, there
   exist three identifiable components within the optimal control strategy
   so as to reduce the lateral deviation. The paper presents a path
   controller, based on nonlinear optimal control theory, that incorporates
   the three components. It is shown that friction adaptation may be
   implemented in a very efficient manner; the controller deals with
   different levels of road friction by scaling the dynamic variables from
   a fixed reference level. The approach provides an algorithm for adapting
   switching thresholds between the different components of the controller.
   In this study it is verified that the controller can deal with a wide
   range of kinematic conditions, and compares favorably with previous
   results of open-loop trajectory optimisation.}},

Pages = {{1341-1364}},
Abstract = {{The steady-state turning of a bicycle arises when the bicycle/rider
   system negotiates a constant radius turn with constant speed and roll
   angle. This paper explores steady-state turning by employing a bicycle
   instrumented to measure steering torque, steering angle, and bicycle
   speed, acceleration, and angular velocity. We report data obtained from
   134 trials using two subjects executing steady turns defined by nine
   different radii, three speeds, and three rider lean conditions. A model
   for steady-state turning, based on the Whipple bicycle model, is used to
   interpret the experimental results. Overall, the model explains 95.6\%
   of the variability in the estimated bicycle roll angle, 99.4\% of the
   variability in the measured steering angle, and 6.5\% of the variability
   in the measured steering torque. However, the model explains 56.6\% of
   the variability in steering torque for the subset of trials without
   exaggerated rider lean relative to the bicycle frame. Thus, the model,
   which assumes a rigid and non-leaning rider, reasonably predicts bicycle
   roll and steering angles for all rider lean conditions and steering
   torque without exaggerated rider lean. The findings demonstrate that
   lateral shifting of the bicycle/rider centre of mass strongly influences
   the steering torque, suggesting that rider lean plays an important role
   in bicycle control during steady-state turning. By contrast, the
   required steering angle is largely insensitive to rider lean, suggesting
   that the steering angle serves as a superior cue for bicycle control
   relative to the steering torque.}},

   approach handles switching based on the delayed states (in addition to
   the states) for a PWA time-delay system, considers structured as well as
   unstructured uncertainty and reduces the conservativeness of previous
   approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated
   by comparing with the existing methods through numerical examples.}},

Title = {{Direct-write maskless lithography of LBL nanocomposite films and its
   prospects for MEMS technologies}},

Abstract = {{Application of nanocomposites in MEMS, flexible electronics, and
   biomedical devices is likely to demonstrate new performance standards
   and resolve a number of difficult technical problems enabled by the
   unique combinations of electrical, optical, and mechanical properties.
   This study explores the possibility of making microscale nanocomposite
   patterns using the fusion of two highly versatile techniques:
   direct-write maskless UV patterning and layer-by-layer assembly (LBL).
   Together they can be applied to the production of a wide variety of
   nanostructured coatings with complex patterns. Single-walled carbon
   nanotube (SWNT) and gold nanoparticle LBL nanocomposites assembled with
   chitosan (CH) were made into prototypical patterns such as concentric
   helices and bus-line-and-stimulation-pads (BLASPs) used in flexible
   antennas and neuroprosthetic devices. The spatial resolution of the
   technique was established with the standard line grids to be at least 1
   mm. Gold nanoparticle films revealed better accuracy and higher
   resolution in direct-write patterning than SWNT composites, possibly due
   to the granular rather than fibrous nature of the composites. The
   conductivity of the patterned composites was 6.45 x 10(-5) Omega m and
   3.80 x 10(-6) Omega m at 20 degrees C for nanotube and nanoparticle
   composites, respectively; in both cases it exceeds electrical parameters
   of similar composites. Fundamental and technological prospects of
   nanocomposite MEMS devices in different areas including implantable
   biomedical, sensing, and optical devices are discussed.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2429-2432}},
Abstract = {{Although a multitude of microporous coordination polymers (MCPs) with
   ultrahigh surface area have been reported in the last decade, none of
   these can come close to matching the cost/performance ratio of
   conventional sorbents such as zeolites and carbons for most
   applications. There is a need to drastically reduce the cost of MCPs and
   this goal cannot be achieved through complex linker synthesis strategies
   so often used to boost MCP performance. Here two new MCPs: UMCM-8
   (Zn4O(benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate)

   (Zn4O(naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate)
   (1.5)(biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate)(1.5)) are described and the concept
   of using mixtures of readily available linear linkers that enforce
   different spacings between network nodes is introduced as a means to
   reduce interpenetration. These new MCPs demonstrate
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas over 4000 m(2) g(-1) and high

   reactions occur in common materials such as lead. Consequently, accurate

   designing an effective interrogation system. Advanced Monte Carlo codes
   such as MCNPX-PoliMi are ideal for simulating these quantities. In this

Abstract = {{Optical detection of ultrasound is an emerging technique based on the
   interaction of strain field and optical field, modulating the optical
   properties of the resonance cavity for sensitive detection. Such a
   detection scheme can have several unique advantages, such as broadband
   response and size-independent sensitivity, compared with conventional
   piezoelectric transducers. Detector's high sensitivity is essential for
   deep penetration depth, especially for high-resolution imaging because
   of the strong attenuation of high-frequency ultrasound. Besides, small
   element size has the advantage of realizing wide acceptance angle of
   ultrasound detection. Previously we have demonstrated optical-based
   ultrasound detectors using polymer microring resonators, showing flat
   spectral response from dc to high frequency, over 90 MHz at -3-dB. By
   improving the fabrication process, we are able to achieve a new
   generation device with higher sensitivity and smaller element size. An
   ultralow noise-equivalent pressure of 21.4 Pa over 1-75 MHz range has
   been achieved using a fabricated detector of 60 mu m diameter. We will
   mainly demonstrate its applications to photoacoustic imaging, including
   photoacoustic computed tomography and photoacoustic microscopy. The new
   generation device can also be applied to other ultrasound-related
   imaging and detection.}},

   particles is used in the extended Kalman filter to reduce the

   estimate the source signals that include both independent signals and
   dependent signals that have some dominant components in the time or some
   linear transform domains (e.g., frequency domain, time/frequency domain,
   or wavelet domain). In addition, an SCA method is also developed in this

   multiple linear transform domains. A case study of a forging process is

Abstract = {{Conventional ordered-subsets (OS) methods for regularized image
   reconstruction involve computing the gradient of the regularizer for
   every subset update. When dealing with large problems with many subsets,
   such as in 3D X-ray CT, computing the gradient for each subset update
   can be very computationally expensive. To mitigate this issue, some
   investigators use unregularized iterations followed by a denoising
   operation after updating all subsets.(1) Although such methods save
   computation, their convergence properties are uncertain, and since they
   may not be minimizing any particular cost function it becomes more
   difficult to design regularization parameters. Furthermore, it is known
   that inserting filtering steps into unregularized algorithms can lead to
   undesirable spatial resolution properties.(2) Our goal here is to reduce
   the computational cost without inducing such problems. We propose a new
   OS-type algorithm that is derived using optimization transfer
   principles. The proposed method allows the gradient of the regularizer
   to be updated less frequently, and thus reduces the computational
   expense when many subsets are used. Our derivation leads to a correction
   term that accounts for the fact that the regularizer gradient is updated
   less frequent than every sub-iteration. Simulations and a phantom
   experiment show that the proposed method reconstructed images with
   compatible image quality within reduced computation time.}},

Abstract = {{Although statistical image reconstruction methods for X-ray CT can
   provide improved image quality at reduced patient doses, computation
   times for 3D axial and helical CT are a challenge. Rapidly converging
   algorithms are needed for practical use. Augmented Lagrangian methods
   based on variable splitting recently have been found to be effective for
   image denoising and deblurring applications.(5) These methods are
   particularly effective for non-smooth regularizers such as total
   variation or those involving the l(1) norm. However, when standard
   ``split Bregman{''} methods(6) are applied directly to 3D X-ray CT
   problems, numerous auxiliary variables are needed, leading to
   undesirably high memory requirements.(7) For minimizing regularized,
   weighted least-squares (WLS) cost functions, we propose a new splitting
   approach for CT, based on the alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM)(1,5) that has multiple benefits over previous
   methods: (i) reduced memory requirements, (ii) effective preconditioning
   using modified ramp/cone filters, (iii) accommodating very general
   regularizers including edge-preserving roughness penalties, total
   variation methods, and sparsifying transforms like wavelets. Numerical
   results show that the proposed algorithm converges rapidly, and that the
   cone filter is particularly effective for accelerating convergence.}},

Abstract = {{Gossypibomas are foreign objects, usually surgical sponges or towels,
   accidentally retained in the human body during an operation. They are
   associated with significant postsurgical complications, morbidity and
   mortality. Postsurgical radiographs are considered the standard of care
   for a retained foreign body, but their detection sensitivity typically
   ranges between 60\% and 80\%. To address this we have microfabricated
   x-ray visible microtags that can be attached to foreign bodies and allow
   them to be easily recognized by a trained radiologist or a computer
   aided detection (CAD) algorithm. Key element of the microtag design is
   the use of three radiopaque beads placed in a precise, triangular
   configuration. We demonstrated that those microtags are visible in
   standard radiographs over different backgrounds (soft tissue, bone) and
   at different spatial orientations. We envision that these microtags
   attached to surgical sponges and towels will greatly increase the
   detection sensitivity and specificity of gossypibomas at an
   infinitesimal cost and will be used in the operating room to provide
   point of care information to the surgeons.}},

Abstract = {{Noninvasive detection of glucose has been heavily researched in their
   roles of offering cost-effective, painless, and bloodless monitoring of
   glucose concentration. In this work, we describe a novel, label-free,
   and sensitive approach for detecting the glucose concentration in human
   interstitial fluid samples using the opto-fluidic ring resonator (OFRR).
   The OFRR incorporates microfluidics and optical ring resonator sensing
   technology to achieve rapid label-free detection in a small and low-cost
   platform. In this study, bulk refractive index measurements are
   presented. Results show that the OFRR is able to detect glucose at
   medically relevant concentrations in interstitial fluid ranging from 0
   to 25 mM, with a detection limit of 0.32 mM, which is lower than
   clinical requirement by one order of magnitude. Our work is believed to
   lead to a device that can be used to frequently monitor glucose
   concentration in a low-cost and painless manner.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions to transient heat conduction problems are often
   obtained by superposition of a particular solution (often the
   steady-state solution) and an eigenfunction series, representing the
   terms that decay exponentially with time. Here, a finite element
   realization of this method is presented in which conventional finite
   element discretization is used for the spatial distribution of
   temperature and analytical methods for the time dependence. This leads
   to a linear eigenvalue problem whose solution then enables a general
   numerical model of the transient system to be created. The method is an
   attractive alternative to conventional time-marching schemes,
   particularly in cases where it is desired to explore the effect of a
   wide range of operating parameters. The method can be applied to any
   transient heat conduction problem, but particular attention is paid to
   the case where the Biot number is small compared with unity and where
   the evolution of the system is very close to that with zero heat loss
   from the exposed surfaces. This situation arises commonly in machines
   such as brakes and clutches which experience occasional short periods of
   intense heating. Numerical examples show that with typical parameter
   values, the simpler zero heat loss solution provides very good accuracy.
   One also shows that good approximations can be achieved using a
   relatively small subset of the eigenvectors of the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous vehicles have attracted more attention in recent years as

   parameterization, determines a collision-free trajectory when a vehicle
   collision with obstacles is likely to happen. Then an MPC-based control
   system controls the front steering and individual wheel torques to track
   the desired collision-free reference trajectory. The proposed system is
   evaluated through simulation, using an eight-degrees-of-freedom vehicle
   model with a `magic formula' tire model, active front steering, and

Abstract = {{This chapter discusses strategies to coordinate charging of autonomous
   plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The chapter briefly reviews the state
   of the art with respect to grid level analyses of PEV charging, and
   frames PEV coordination in terms of whether they are centralized or
   decentralized and whether they are optimal or near-optimal in some
   sense. The bulk of the chapter is devoted to presenting centralized and
   decentralized cost-optimizing frameworks for identifying and
   coordinating PEV charging. We use a centralized framework to show that
   ``valley filling{''} charge patterns are globally optimal. Decentralized
   electricity cost minimizing frameworks for PEV charging can be framed in
   the context of noncooperative dynamic game theory and are related to
   recent work on mean field and potential games. Interestingly, in this
   context it can be difficult to achieve a Nash equilibrium (NE) if
   electricity price is the sole objective. The decentralized algorithm
   discussed in this chapter introduces a very small penalty term that
   damps unwanted negotiating dynamics. With this term, the decentralized
   algorithm takes on the form of a contraction mapping and, in the
   infinite system limit, the NE is unique and the algorithm will converge
   to it under relatively loose assumptions.}},

Title = {{A geometric approach to multi-view compressive imaging}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider multi-view imaging problems in which an
   ensemble of cameras collect images describing a common scene. To
   simplify the acquisition and encoding of these images, we study the
   effectiveness of non-collaborative compressive sensing encoding schemes
   wherein each sensor directly and independently compresses its image
   using randomized measurements. After these measurements and also perhaps
   the camera positions are transmitted to a central node, the key to an
   accurate reconstruction is to fully exploit the joint correlation among
   the signal ensemble. To capture such correlations, we propose a
   geometric modeling framework in which the image ensemble is treated as a
   sampling of points from a low-dimensional manifold in the ambient signal
   space. Building on results that guarantee stable embeddings of manifolds
   under random measurements, we propose a ``manifold lifting{''} algorithm
   for recovering the ensemble that can operate even without knowledge of
   the camera positions. We divide our discussion into two scenarios, the
   near-field and far-field cases, and describe how the manifold lifting
   algorithm could be applied to these scenarios. At the end of this paper,
   we present an in-depth case study of a far-field imaging scenario, where
   the aim is to reconstruct an ensemble of satellite images taken from
   different positions with limited but overlapping fields of view. In this
   case study, we demonstrate the impressive power of random measurements
   to capture single- and multi-image structure without explicitly
   searching for it, as the randomized measurement encoding in conjunction
   with the proposed manifold lifting algorithm can even outperform
   image-by-image transform coding.}},

Abstract = {{Sensors with long lifetimes are ideal for infrastructure monitoring.
   Miniaturized sensor systems are only capable of storing small amounts of
   energy. Prior work has increased sensor lifetime through the reduction
   of supply voltage, necessitating voltage conversion from storage
   elements such as batteries. Sensor lifetime can be further extended by
   harvesting from solar, vibrational, or thermal energy. Since harvested
   energy is sporadic, it must be detected and stored. Harvesting sources
   do not provide voltage levels suitable for secondary power sources,
   necessitating DC-DC up-conversion. We demonstrate a 8.75mm(3) sensor
   system with a near-threshold ARM microcontroller, custom 3.3fW/bit SRAM,
   two 1mm(2) solar cells, a thin-film Li-ion battery, and integrated power
   management unit. The 7.7 mu W system enters a 550pW data-retentive sleep
   state between measurements and harvests solar energy to enable energy
   autonomy. Our receiver and transmitter architectures benefit from a
   design strategy that employs mixed signal and digital circuit schemes
   that perform well in advanced CMOS integrated circuit technologies. A
   prototype transmitter implemented in 0.13 mu m CMOS satisfies the
   requirements for Zigbee, but consumes far less power consumption than
   state-of-the-art commercial devices.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of cost-effective sensing technologies has now enabled the
   use of dense arrays of sensors to monitor the behavior and condition of
   large-scale bridges. The continuous operation of dense networks of
   sensors presents a number of new challenges including how to manage such
   massive amounts of data that can be created by the system. This paper
   reports on the progress of the creation of cyberinfrastructure tools
   which hierarchically control networks of wireless sensors deployed in a
   long-span bridge. The internet-enabled cyberinfrastructure is centrally
   managed by a powerful database which controls the flow of data in the
   entire monitoring system architecture. A client-server model built upon
   the database provides both data-provider and system end-users with
   secured access to various levels of information of a bridge. In the
   system, information on bridge behavior (e.g., acceleration, strain,
   displacement) and environmental condition (e.g., wind speed, wind
   direction, temperature, humidity) are uploaded to the database from
   sensor networks installed in the bridge. Then, data interrogation
   services interface with the database via client APIs to autonomously
   process data. The current research effort focuses on an assessment of
   the scalability and long-term robustness of the proposed
   cyberinfrastructure framework that has been implemented along with a
   permanent wireless monitoring system on the New Carquinez (Alfred Zampa
   Memorial) Suspension Bridge in Vallejo, CA. Many data interrogation
   tools are under development using sensor data and bridge metadata (e.g.,
   geometric details, material properties, etc.) Sample data interrogation
   clients including those for the detection of faulty sensors, automated
   modal parameter extraction.}},

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic imaging has been widely used in structural and functional
   imaging. Because of its safety, high resolution, and high imaging depth,
   it has great potential for a variety of medical studies. Capillaries are
   the smallest blood vessels and enable the exchange of oxygen and
   nutrients. Noninvasive flow speed measurement of capillaries in vivo can
   benefit the study of vascular tone changes and rheological properties of
   blood cells in capillaries. Recently, there has been a growing interest
   in photoacoustic velocimetry, such as photoacoustic Doppler and M-mode
   photoacoustic flow imaging. Methods capable of high-resolution imaging
   and low-speed flow measurement are suitable to measure blood speeds in
   capillaries. Previously we proposed photoacoustic correlation
   spectroscopy (PACS) and shown its feasibility for low-speed flow
   measurement. Here, in vivo measurement of blood speeds in capillaries in
   a chick embryo model by PACS technique is demonstrated. The
   laser-scanning photoacoustic microscopy system is used for fast imaging
   acquisition and high-resolution imaging. The measured speed in
   capillaries is similar to those found in literatures, which confirm the
   feasibility of the PACS method for blood velocimetry. This technique
   suggests a fairly simple way to study blood flow speeds in capillaries.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of pure optical photoacoustic microscopy(POPAM) was proposed
   based on optical rastering of a focused excitation beam and optically
   sensing the photoacoustic signal using a microring resonator fabricated
   by a nanoimprinting technique. After some refinedment of in the
   resonator structure and mold fabrication, an ultrahigh Q factor of
   3.0x10(5) was achieved which provided high sensitivity with a noise
   equivalent detectable pressure(NEDP) value of 29Pa. This NEDP is much
   lower than the hundreds of Pascals achieved with existing optical
   resonant structures such as etalons, fiber gratings and dielectric
   multilayer interference filters available for acoustic measurement. The
   featured high sensitivity allowed the microring resonator to detect the
   weak photoacoustic signals from micro-or submicroscale objects. The
   inherent superbroad bandwidth of the optical microring resonator
   combined with an optically focused scanning beam provided POPAM of high
   resolution in the axial as well as both lateral directions while the
   axial resolution of conventional photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) suffers
   from the limited bandwidth of PZT detectors. Furthermore, the broadband
   microring resonator showed similar sensitivity to that of our most
   sensitive PZT detector. The current POPAM system provides a lateral
   resolution of 5 mu m and an axial resolution of 8 mu m, comparable to
   that achieved by optical microscopy while presenting the unique contrast
   of optical absorption and functional information complementing other
   optical modalities. The 3D structure of microvasculature, including
   capillary networks, and even individual red blood cells have been
   discerned successfully in the proof-of-concept experiments on mouse
   bladders ex vivo and mouse ears in vivo. The potential of approximately
   GHz bandwidth of the microring resonator also might allow much higher
   resolution than shown here in microscopy of optical absorption and
   acoustic propagation properties at depths in unfrozen tissue specimens
   or thicker tissue sections not now imageable with current optical or
   acoustic microscopes of comparable resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Neural probe insertion methods have a direct impact on the longevity of
   the device in the brain. Initial tissue and vascular damage caused by
   the probe entering the brain triggers a chronic tissue response that is
   known to attenuate neural recordings and ultimately encapsulate the
   probes. Smaller devices have been found to evoke reduced inflammatory
   response. One way to record from undamaged neural networks may be to
   position the electrode sites away from the probe. To investigate this
   approach, we are developing probes with controllably movable electrode
   projections, which would move outside of the zone that is damaged by the
   insertion of the larger probe. The objective of this study was to test
   the capability of conjugated polymer bilayer actuators to actuate neural
   electrode projections from a probe shank into a transparent brain
   phantom.
   Parylene neural probe devices, having five electrode projections with
   actuating segments and with varying widths (50 - 250 mu m) and lengths
   (200 - 1000 mu m) were fabricated. The electroactive polymer polypyrrole
   (PPy) was used to bend or flatten the projections. The devices were
   inserted into the brain phantom using an electronic microdrive while
   simultaneously activating the actuators. Deflections were quantified
   based on video images.
   The electrode projections were successfully controlled to either remain
   flat or to actuate out-of-plane and into the brain phantom during
   insertion. The projection width had a significant effect on their
   ability to deflect within the phantom, with thinner probes deflecting
   but not the wider ones. Thus, small integrated conjugated polymer
   actuators may enable multiple neuro-experiments and applications not
   possible before.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has emerged as a powerful
   analytical technique for direct detection of chemical and biological
   analytes because of high sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid response.
   Here we propose and develop a novel optofluidic SERS structure, i.e.,
   nanoparticle-functionalized flow-through multihole capillary. This
   unique platform provides many advantages. First, its 3-dimensional (3-D)
   structure, similar to nanoporous aluminum membranes, nanoporous polymer
   monoliths, and photonic crystal fibers (PCFs), provides large surface
   area for the deposition of noble nanoparticles or nanoclusters to
   achieve high SERS intensity. Second, it has well-defined flow-through
   channels. It provides robust and controllable nanoparticle
   immobilization like PCFs, but much higher nanoparticle density thus
   large SERS-active sites due to large surface within the detection
   volume, and also enables fast and convenient analyte delivery for
   real-time, online detection. Third, the well-defined multihole capillary
   can also confine and transmit light along the longitudinal direction,
   accumulating large SERS signal like PCFs. Fourth, it is easy to
   integrate with other sensing platforms, such as label-free biosensors,
   to provide comprehensive information on molecular interaction. Moreover,
   the multihole capillary can be mass-produced easily and cost effectively
   using the fiber drawing method. In this report, using a capillary
   consisting of thousands of micrometer-sized holes adsorbed with gold
   nanoparticles, we investigated the proposed optofluidic SERS system
   using the transverse and longitudinal detection methods, where the SERS
   excitation and collection were perpendicular to and along the capillary,
   respectively. A detection limit better than 100 fM for rhodamine 6G was
   achieved with an enhancement factor exceeding 10(8).}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle active safety systems stabilise the vehicle by controlling tyre
   forces. They work well only when the tyre forces commanded by the safety
   systems are within the friction limit. Therefore, knowledge of the
   tyre/road friction coefficient can improve the performance of vehicle
   active safety systems. This study presents four methods to estimate the
   friction coefficient based on four different excitation conditions:
   medium lateral excitation, large lateral excitation, small longitudinal
   excitation, and large longitudinal excitation. For the lateral
   excitation cases, the estimation is based on vehicle lateral/yaw
   dynamics and Brush tyre model, whereas for the longitudinal excitation
   cases, the estimation basis is the relationship between the tyre
   longitudinal slip and traction force. These four methods are then
   integrated to increase the working range of the estimator and to improve
   robustness. The performance of the integrated estimation algorithm is
   verified through experimental data collected on several surface
   conditions.}},

   This paper presents the results of an optimization study of bistable

   energy harvesting. Optimum solutions are investigated in a series of
   design parameter studies intended to reveal the complex interactions of

   considers the optimal choice of device aspect ratio, thickness, laminate

Abstract = {{In this study, an extension of linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control
   theory is used to determine the optimal state feedback controller for a
   nonlinear energy harvesting system that is driven by a stochastic
   disturbance. Specifically, the energy harvester is a base-excited
   single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) resonant oscillator with an
   electromagnetic transducer embedded between the ground and moving mass.
   The electromagnetic transducer used to harvest energy from the SDOF
   oscillator introduces a nonlinear Coulomb friction force into the
   system, which must be accounted for in the design of the controller. As
   such, the development of the optimal controller for this system is based
   on statistical linearization, whereby the Coulomb friction force is
   replaced by an equivalent linear viscous damping term, which is
   calculated from the stationary covariance of the closed-loop system. It
   is shown that the covariance matrix and optimal feedback gain matrix can
   be computed by implementing an iterative algorithm involving linear
   matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simulation results are presented for the
   SDOF energy harvester in which the performance of the optimal state
   feedback control law is compared to the performance of the optimal
   static admittance over a range of disturbance bandwidths.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear piezoelectric wind energy harvester is proposed which has a
   low startup wind speed and is not restricted to a specific wind speed.
   By using the piezoelectric transduction mechanism, the gearbox is
   eliminated from the system and the start up speed is improved. Permanent
   magnets are placed in the blade part of the windmill. The interactions
   between the rotating magnets, positioned on the blades, and the tip
   magnets mounted on the piezoelectric beams directly and parametrically
   excite the beams. The nonlinear magnetic force makes the vibrations of
   the beams nonlinear and can make the beams bi-stable. This phenomenon is
   utilized to enhance the power output and to improve the robustness of
   the power production. Two designs are presented which incorporate
   parametric and ordinary excitations to generate electric power. The
   performance of each design is examined through experimental
   investigations. An analytic model is developed which is verified by the
   experimental results and explains the nonlinear phenomena captured by
   the experimental investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Verifying that logic control satisfies some desirable properties is
   essential to the proper and safe functioning of a manufacturing system.
   Input order robustness is one such property that has not been thoroughly
   explored. If a logic controller is input order robust for all sets of
   inputs whose elements can arrive in any order and whose order should not
   affect the logic controller's final state or set of outputs, then the
   logic controller behaves the same in these regards irrespective of the
   inputs' order. This paper develops a procedure to verify input order
   robustness for logic controllers implemented in a variety of formalisms,
   and demonstrates its application on Event-Condition-Action Modular
   Finite-State Machines (ECA MFSM) and IEC 61499 controllers.
   Additionally, this verification is extended to a class of networks of
   controllers, and the computational complexity of such verifications are
   discussed.
   Note to Practitioners-Complex logic controllers are sometimes written
   assuming that inputs will occur in a specific order. If the input order
   is switched due to network or processing delay, then the logic control
   may respond in an unexpected fashion. If the logic control's response
   depends on the order in which the inputs occur for inputs whose order
   should not matter, then improper behavior may result-occasionally-and
   thus be very difficult to diagnose and debug. The verification procedure
   provided in this paper enables system designers to find design issues in
   the control logic associated with inputs occurring in different orders
   so that these issues may be remedied before they cause improper behavior
   and downtime. Since the verification procedure uses simulations of the
   system, the time required for such simulations will depend on the
   system's size. This verification procedure was motivated by the control
   of manufacturing systems, but it also can be applied to other types of
   systems with distributed or networked controllers.}},

Title = {{From Hardware-in-the-Loop to Hybrid Process Simulation: An Ontology for
   the Implementation Phase of a Manufacturing System}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) is a widely used testing approach for
   embedded systems, where real components and/or controllers are tested in
   closed-loop with a simulation model. In this paper, we generalize HIL by
   combining multiple simulations and real components into a Hybrid Process
   Simulation (HPS). An HPS is a test setup that contains at least one
   simulated and one actual component, but may contain many of both. It is
   implemented such that each simulated component can be swapped out with
   its real counterpart without making changes to the existing system, and
   vice versa. In this paper, an ontology which provides a conceptual
   architecture is developed for an HPS, such that a general interpretation
   of a manufacturing system's implementation is made possible. A
   formalized application method is then devised for replacing simulations
   with real processes and vice versa. Aconceptual architecture is put
   forth that separates the effect of a component from its spatial essence
   (volume or mass). This separation allows workpieces in a manufacturing
   process, for example, to go from the physical world into the virtual
   world (computer simulation) and back again repeatedly. The conceptual
   architecture is applied to a small manufacturing line in the following
   scenarios: replacing a real robot with a simulated robot, replacing a
   manufacturing cell with a simulated manufacturing cell, and adding a new
   simulated manufacturing cell to the existing system. These applications
   successfully demonstrate how an HPS can be used to test a manufacturing
   system setup with multiple regions of real and simulated components.
   Note to Practitioner-Traditionally, in the manufacturing system
   development process, once the design is completed, a simulation model is
   built for design validation. Then, the actual system is built. The
   confidence of the simulation is limited by the accuracy of the
   simulation model, and testing of the actual system can be time-consuming
   with high safety risks, such as personal injury and damages to
   equipment. To accommodate product changes and revisions, there is an
   ongoing continuous improvement process on the plant floor, such as
   reconfiguration of manufacturing system equipment, and adding hardware
   and software into existing processes. This may result in loss of
   production due to a long validation period with possibilities of damaged
   equipment. With the HPS approach outlined in this paper, however, the
   simulated and actual components can be validated and tested iteratively;
   this means each component can be tested with more individual focus,
   without having to wait until the entire process is complete. In the case
   of modifying an existing system, simulations can be seamlessly
   integrated with the real process to evaluate different solutions before
   a particular option is financially committed. Because the actual
   components are used during the simulation phase, the overall validation
   accuracy is less dependent on a single simulation model, while the
   testing scope is significantly expanded.}},

Title = {{Functional Morphing in Multistage Manufacturing and Its Applications in
   High-Definition Metrology-Based Process Control}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In multistage manufacturing processes equipped with high-definition
   metrology (HDM), part surface quality characteristics can be observed to
   change or ``morph{''} from stage to stage. Such part surface variation
   propagations are caused by the physical processes, part attributes, and
   the interaction between stages. Previous research on variation
   propagation modeling focuses on part dimensional quality using discrete
   key product characteristics or vectors which have limitations in
   analyzing complex surface variation patterns contained in the HDM data.
   This paper proposes a new concept of functional morphing to characterize
   the surface changes and applies it to process control in high-precision
   manufacturing. Unlike conventional morphing algorithms that focus on
   transformations between geometries only, functional morphing integrates
   process physical insights into the geometric mappings, thus
   characterizing the complex HDM data patterns in physically meaningful
   ways. Specifically, a functional free form deformation approach
   including forward and backward mappings is developed to extract mapping
   functions between manufacturing stages to enable surface variation
   propagation analysis. The forward mapping function allows for accurate
   interstage adjustment that introduces shape deformation upstream to
   compensate for the end-of-line errors. The backward mapping function can
   predict surfaces at intermediate stages based on end-of-line
   measurements, leading to a cost-effective interstage process monitoring
   scheme. The interstage monitoring can also ensure the repeatability of a
   process controlled by the interstage compensation algorithm. The
   developed monitoring and adjustment methods are demonstrated via a case
   study of a two-stage machining process. Other potential applications of
   functional morphing such as process tolerance design are also discussed.
   Note to Practitioners-This work is motivated by the quality control of
   surfaces generated by multistage machining processes, such as the deck
   face on an automotive engine head. The part surface shape changes from
   stage to stage in a very complex manner and can be precisely
   characterized by a HDM system that collects high density data over the
   surface. Therefore, the HDM provides opportunities to understand and
   improve surface quality control strategies in high-precision
   manufacturing. Although a significant amount of research has been
   carried out in studying the part dimensional changes over stages, there
   are limited approaches available to analyze complex shape changes for
   surface variation reduction. This paper develops a new functional
   morphing model to characterize the between-stage surface changes.
   Compared with conventional models, the functional morphing has
   advantages in dealing with HDM data. The model facilitates monitoring of
   intermediate stages based on end-of-line measurements to reduce
   measurement costs. It also allows for an interstage compensation
   strategy that introduces shape deformation upstream to compensate for
   the end-of-line errors. The compensation strategy in this paper uses
   fixture locating pins and clamping forces to reduce the global form
   error. In future research, other adjustment mechanisms such as changes
   in cutter path and feed rate will be incorporated to remove part local
   distortions.}},

Abstract = {{We report a computerized microfluidic real time embryo culture and assay
   device that can perform automated periodic analyses of embryo
   metabolism. This automated program uses a modified ``gated injection''
   scheme (sample injection, reagent mixing, enzyme reaction of 15 min
   incubation, and sample detection) to sequentially measure fluorescence
   from sample, reference, and background (without any analyte) every hour.
   Measurements assessed with reference solutions demonstrated the
   stability of these microfluidic measurements over a 24 h period.
   Furthermore, this system was able to measure time dependent nutrient
   consumption by single or multiple (10) live mouse blastocyst-stage
   embryos with pmol h(-1) sensitivity. Mechanical deformation-based
   microfluidic actuation created by computerized movement of Braille pins
   enables automated fluid pumping and valving sequences without unwanted
   gravity-driven backflow or exposure to electrical fields as would be
   required in electrokinetic schemes. The convenient, non-invasive, and

   integrated microfluidic platforms for practical single embryo culture
   and real time biochemical analysis to assess embryo viability and select
   embryos with the greatest implantation potential, thus improving success

Abstract = {{The Corner2 algorithm(1) was designed to resolve the data delivery
   problem on maskless lithography systems. The Corner2 algorithm utilizes
   dictionary-based compression to handle repeated circuit components and
   applies a transform which is specifically tailored for layout images to
   deal with irregular circuit components. It obtains high compression
   ratios and fast encoding/decoding times while requiring limited decoder
   memory in the decoder hardware. Moreover, the entire decompression is
   simple so that it could be implemented as a hardware add-on to the
   lithography writer. However, there is some room for improvement in how
   we build the dictionary to handle frequent circuit patterns. In this
   paper, we introduce an improved way to discover frequent patterns from
   the circuit layout images based on binary integer programming. By
   applying this improved frequent pattern dictionary, we were able to
   obtain 4.5-35.8\% more compression while maintaining the same Corner2
   decoder. Moreover, this binary integer programming framework could be
   applied to other binary image compression problems with similar pattern

Abstract = {{Composite structures are being extensively used in modern industrial
   applications due to their superior physical attributes, thus
   necessitating the need for structural health monitoring (SHM) systems to
   ensure their structural integrety. Guided wave (GW)-based methods are an
   obvious choice because of their ability to travel long distances through
   the thickness of the composite structures. In this work, local
   interaction simulation approach (LISA), a finite difference (FD)-based
   numerical method, is used to study the GW propagation characteristics in
   laminated composite plates. The iterative equations, which form the core
   of the LISA method, have been derived for orthotropic materials with
   in-plane rotation. Simulation results for uni-ply and quasi-isotropic
   graphite/epoxy laminates are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the
   advanced equations.}},

Abstract = {{The high strength to weight ratio of fibrous composites such as
   glass-fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP) makes them prominent structural
   materials. However, their laminar nature is susceptible to delamination

   nano-tubes (CNT) have been recently used to tailor the electrical
   conductivity of polymer based materials that otherwise behave as
   insulators. The occurrence of damage in the polymer matrix produces
   localized changes in conductivity which can be tracked using electrical
   impedance tomography (EIT). This paper explores combining advances in
   composite manufacturing with EIT to develop a SHM technique that
   exploits anisotropic conductance monitoring for enhanced delamination
   and matrix crack detection.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded computation in wireless sensor networks (WSN) can extract
   useful information from sensor data in a fast and efficient manner.
   Embedded computing has the benefit of saving both bandwidth and power.
   However, computational capability often comes at the expense of power
   consumption on the wireless sensor node. This is an especially critical
   issue for battery powered wireless sensor nodes. By developing a hybrid
   network consisting of wireless units optimized for sensing interspersed
   with more powerful computationally focused units, it is now possible to
   build a network that is more efficient and flexible than a homogeneous
   WSN. For this project, such a network was developed using Narada units
   as low-power sensing units and iMote2 units as ultra-efficient
   computational engines. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of such
   a configuration a network was created to extract structural modal
   parameters based on Markov parameters. This paper validates the
   performance of the heterogeneous WSN using a laboratory structure tested
   under impulse loading.}},

Abstract = {{Recent simulations have studied the formation of patterns in a binary

   obtained by adding a third surfactant to the monolayer as a guide
   towards increasing the richness and diversity of patchy particles

   produced through different combinations of simple design elements, like
   nanocolloid size, degree of surfactant immiscibility, stoichiometry of
   the monolayer, and length difference between surfactants. In all cases,
   free energy minimization through conformational entropy maximization

   well as to better understand the challenges that have to be faced in the
   foreseeable future. Intuitive understanding is accompanied by rigorous
   analysis for each key concept. The analysis ranges from the circuit to
   the micro-architectural level, and reference is given to process,
   physical and system levels when necessary. Among the main goals of this
   paper, it is shown that many paradigms and approaches borrowed from
   traditional above-threshold low-power VLSI design are actually
   incorrect. Accordingly, common misconceptions in the ULP domain are

Abstract = {{Among structural health monitoring techniques, Lamb waves is frequently
   used as diagnostic tools to detect damage in plate-like structures. Lamb
   waves usually excited by piezoelectric transducers essentially involve
   exciting the structure with high frequency guided-waves and processing
   the difference in structural response with respect to a baseline signal
   for the pristine condition to detect damage. As a kind of baseline free
   method, time reversal (TR) method applied to ultrasonic detection and
   focusing with arrays of transducers has been proposed. The decomposition
   of the time reversal operator (DORT) method is a selective detection and
   focusing technique using an array of transmit-receive transducers.
   Unlike body waves, the propagation of Lamb waves is complicated due to
   their dispersive and multimode characteristics. So Lamb wave is hard to
   locate different scatterers on the plate using DORT method because of
   the asymmetry of the time reversal transfer matrix. In this paper, a
   proposed approach based on the DORT method is developed to distinguish
   and locate two simulated damages on the aluminum plate using Lamb wave
   through finite element simulation on the commercial finite element code
   ANSYS platform. The behavior of reflected waves is analyzed by studying
   the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the time reversal transfer matrix,
   showing that the number of significant eigenvalues is not exactly the
   number of damage targets and two significant eigenvalues correspond to
   one target. This method, which uses PZT array and operates under
   multi-modes pulse-echo mode, can estimate the position of the damaged
   zone in 2D image by numerically backpropagating selective eigenvector
   using the S-0 and/or A(0) Lamb wave propagation analytical solution.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{621-638}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing interest by the naval engineering community in
   permanent monitoring systems that can monitor the structural behaviour
   of ships during their operation at sea. This study seeks to reduce the
   cost and installation complexity of hull monitoring systems by
   introducing wireless sensors into their architectural designs. Wireless
   sensor networks also provide other advantages over their cable-based
   counterparts such as adaptability, redundancy, and weight savings. While
   wireless sensors can enhance functionality and reduce cost, the
   compartmentalised layout of most ships requires some wired networking to
   communicate data globally throughout the ship. In this study, 20
   wireless sensing nodes are connected to a ship-wide fibre-optic data
   network to serve as a hybrid wireless hull monitoring system on a
   high-speed littoral combat vessel (FSF-1 Sea Fighter). The wireless hull
   monitoring system is used to collect acceleration and strain data during
   unattended operation during a one-month period at sea. The key findings
   of this study include that wireless sensors can be effectively used for
   reliable and accurate hull monitoring. Furthermore, the fact that they
   are low-cost can lead to higher sensor densities in a hull monitoring
   system thereby allowing properties, such as hull mode shapes, to be
   accurately calculated.}},

Abstract = {{We have used density functional theory (DFT) to determine binding
   energies (BE's) of carbon-vacancy (C-v) point-defect complexes of
   probable importance to C-based anelastic relaxation processes in fcc
   iron alloys. Calculations are presented for three types of stable point
   defect clusters: C-v pairs, di-C-v triplets, and tri-C-v quadruplets. We
   demonstrate semi-quantitative consistency of the calculated BE's with
   internal friction results on Fe-36\%Ni-C alloys. The BE's, which are in
   the range -0.37 eV to -0.64 eV, were determined for a hypothetical
   non-magnetic (NM) fcc Fe. The effect of the magnetic state of fcc Fe on
   some of these quantities was investigated by DFT and is shown to be
   significant; the BE's appear to be reduced in antiferromagnetic (AFM)

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{259-266}},
Abstract = {{The net frost expansion (dilation) was determined by monitoring the
   change in length of air-entrained concrete specimens undergoing a
   freeze-thaw cycle between 20 degrees C and -20 degrees C. Two dilation
   processes were found during freezing: an initial dilation at the
   freezing point and a subsequent dilation which continues during the
   entire freezing period. The second dilation dominates when the surface
   is exposed to a deicer solution. For both exposure conditions, a good
   correlation was found between the dilation and the spacing factor, which
   fits well with the hydraulic pressure theory. The results show that a
   lower spacing factor is required for frost protection against salt frost
   attack, consistent with the current practice of recommending higher
   total air content as compared to freezing without salt exposure.
   Concretes that had excellent field durability had frost dilation values
   below the paste fracture strain of about 250 micro strains. The dilation
   results suggest that cryogenic suction of external liquid exacerbates
   internal hydraulic pressure development which in turn may explain the
   surface scaling phenomenon.}},

Title = {{Elastomeric microposts integrated into microfluidics for flow-mediated
   endothelial mechanotransduction analysis}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1865-1873}},
Abstract = {{Mechanotransduction is known as the cellular mechanism converting
   insoluble biophysical signals in the local cellular microenvironment
   (e.g. matrix rigidity, external mechanical forces, and fluid shear) into
   intracellular signalling to regulate cellular behaviours. While
   microfluidic technologies support a precise and independent control of
   soluble factors in the cellular microenvironment (e. g. growth factors,
   nutrients, and dissolved gases), the regulation of insoluble biophysical
   signals in microfluidics, especially matrix rigidity and adhesive
   pattern, has not yet been achieved. Here we reported an integrated soft
   lithography-compatible microfluidic methodology that could enable
   independent controls and modulations of fluid shear, substrate rigidity,
   and adhesive pattern in a microfluidic environment, by integrating
   micromolded elastomeric micropost arrays and microcontact printing with
   microfluidics. The geometry of the elastomeric micropost array could be
   regulated to mediate substrate rigidity and adhesive pattern, and
   further the elastomeric microposts could be utilized as force sensors to
   map live-cell subcellular contractile forces. To illustrate the general
   application of our methodology, we investigated the flow-mediated
   endothelial mechanotransduction process and examined specifically the
   involvement of subcellular contractile forces in the morphological
   realignment process of endothelial cells under a sustained directional
   fluid shear. Our results showed that the cytoskeletal contractile forces
   of endothelial cells were spatiotemporally regulated and coordinated to
   facilitate their morphology elongation process along the direction of
   flow. Together, our study provided an integrated microfluidic strategy
   to modulate the in vitro cellular microenvironment with both defined
   soluble and insoluble signals, and we demonstrated its application to
   investigate quantitatively the involvement of cytoskeletal contractile
   forces in the flow-mediated mechanotransduction process of endothelial
   cells.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{436-453}},
Abstract = {{A Euclidean approximate sparse recovery system consists of parameters k,
   N, an m-by-N measurement matrix, Phi, and a decoding algorithm, D. Given
   a vector, x, the system approximates x by (x) over cap = D(Phi x), which
   must satisfy |(x) over cap -x|(2) <= C|x - x(k)|(2), where x(k) denotes
   the optimal k-term approximation to x. (The output (x) over cap may have
   more than k terms.) For each vector x, the system must succeed with
   probability at least 3/4. Among the goals in designing such systems are
   minimizing the number m of measurements and the runtime of the decoding
   algorithm, D. In this paper, we give a system with m = O(k log(N/k))
   measurements-matching a lower bound, up to a constant factor-and
   decoding time k log(O(1)) N, matching a lower bound up to a polylog(N)
   factor. We also consider the encode time (i.e., the time to multiply Phi
   by x), the time to update measurements (i.e., the time to multiply Phi
   by a 1-sparse x), and the robustness and stability of the algorithm
   (resilience to noise before and after the measurements). Our encode and
   update times are optimal up to log(k) factors. The columns of F have at
   most O(log(2)(k) log(N/k)) nonzeros, each of which can be found in
   constant time. Our full result, a fully polynomial randomized
   approximation scheme, is as follows. If x = x(k)+nu(1), where nu(1) and
   nu(2) (below) are arbitrary vectors (regarded as noise), then setting
   (x) over cap = D(Phi x + nu(2)), and for properly normalized Phi, we get
   |x - (x) over cap|(2)(2) <= (1 + epsilon) |nu(1)|(2)(2) + epsilon
   |nu(2)|(2)(2) using O((k/epsilon) log(N/k)) measurements and (k/epsilon)
   log(O(1))(N) time for decoding.}},

Abstract = {{Design Heuristics are prompts that encourage design space exploration
   during concept generation. Design Heuristics were developed by analyzing
   trends in innovative products and patterns in ideation by engineering
   and industrial designers of varying experience levels. In this study, 48
   freshmen engineering students were given a short design task and a set
   of twelve Design Heuristics Cards. Each card described a heuristic, and
   gave two examples of its application in a product. Students were asked
   to create new design concepts using the heuristics. The results showed
   that the concepts created without Design Heuristics were less developed,
   and were often replications of known ideas or minor changes to existing
   products. However, concepts created using Design Heuristics resulted in
   more developed, creative designs. Students often applied the same
   heuristic in multiple ways, supporting our premise that the heuristics
   lead to exploring multiple solutions. The results also showed that some
   students readily applied the heuristics, while others struggled to
   understand how to apply them.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{1562-1566}},
Abstract = {{The role of ligand-based electronic effects was investigated in the
   Ni-catalyzed polymerization of 4-bromo-2,5-bis(hexyloxy)phenylmagnesium
   chloride. The catalyst with the most electron-donating ligand
   outperformed the other catalysts by providing polymers with narrower
   molecular weight distributions. This result is attributed to both a
   suppression of competing reaction pathways (e. g., chain transfer and
   termination) as well as a relative acceleration of precatalyst
   initiation compared to propagation. Further studies revealed that, for
   all three catalysts, precatalyst initiation is slower than propagation,
   despite the fact that they exhibit the same rate-determining steps
   (i.e., reductive elimination) and have similar catalyst resting states.
   These results suggest that better control over the polymer molecular
   weight, end-functionality and sequence can be obtained with
   electron-rich catalysts, such as those described herein.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a multi-spectral scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) that
   collects fluorescence images in vivo from three target peptides that
   bind specifically to murine colonic adenomas. This ultrathin endoscope
   was demonstrated in a genetically engineered mouse model of spontaneous
   colorectal adenomas based on somatic Apc (adenomatous polyposis coli)
   gene inactivation. The SFE delivers excitation at 440, 532, 635 nm with
   <2 mW per channel. The target 7-mer peptides were conjugated to visible
   organic dyes, including 7-Diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxylic acid (DEAC)
   (lambda(ex)=432 nm,lambda(em)=472 nm), 5-Carboxytetramethylrhodamine
   (5-TAMRA) (lambda(ex)=535 nm,lambda(em)=568 nm), and CF-633
   (lambda(ex)=633 nm,lambda(em)=650 nm). Target peptides were first
   validated using techniques of pfu counting, flow cytometry and
   previously established methods of fluorescence endoscopy. Peptides were
   applied individually or in combination and detected with fluorescence
   imaging. The ability to image multiple channels of fluorescence
   concurrently was successful for all three channels in vitro, while two
   channels were resolved simultaneously in vivo. Selective binding of the
   peptide was evident to adenomas and not to adjacent normal-appearing
   mucosa. Multi-spectral wide-field fluorescence detection using the SFE
   is achievable, and this technology has potential to advance early cancer
   detection and image-guided therapy in human patients by simultaneously
   visualizing multiple over expressed molecular targets unique to
   dysplasia.}},

Abstract = {{Idle speed control is a landmark application of feedback control in
   automotive vehicles that continues to be of significant interest to
   automotive industry practitioners, since improved idle performance and
   robustness translate into better fuel economy, emissions and
   drivability. In this paper, we develop a model predictive control (MPC)
   strategy for regulating the engine speed to the idle speed set-point by
   actuating the electronic throttle and the spark timing. The MPC
   controller coordinates the two actuators according to a specified cost
   function, while explicitly taking into account constraints on the
   control and requirements on the acceptable engine speed range, e.g., to
   avoid engine stalls. Following a process proposed here for the
   implementation of MPC in automotive applications, an MPC controller is
   obtained with excellent performance and robustness as demonstrated in
   actual vehicle tests. In particular, the MPC controller performs better
   than an existing baseline controller in the vehicle, is robust to
   changes in operating conditions, and to different types of disturbances.
   It is also shown that the MPC computational complexity is well within
   the capability of production electronic control unit and that the
   improved performance achieved by the MPC controller can translate into
   fuel economy improvements.}},

Abstract = {{A model-free ON-OFF iterative adaptive controller is described for
   application to microscale servo systems performing repeated motions
   under extremely strict power constraints. The approach is motivated by
   the needs of piezoelectric actuators in autonomous microrobots, where
   power consumption in analog circuitry and/or for position sensing may be
   much larger than that of the actuators themselves. The control algorithm
   adjusts switching instances between ``ON{''} and ``OFF{''} inputs to the
   actuator to minimize an objective function using simultaneously
   perturbed stochastic approximation of the gradient with just a single
   sensor measurement in each iteration. Convergence conditions for the
   gradient approximation are shown to apply when the possibility for a
   range of possible switching times minimizing the objective function is
   accounted for, while a method is proposed for avoiding local minima for
   plants with bounded nonlinearities. The algorithm is tested on a
   prototype piezoelectric microactuator.}},

Abstract = {{All-electric ships (AES), enabled by integrated power systems (IPS),
   have been pursued for both commercial and military applications to meet
   the increasing ship-board power demand and environmental sustainability
   initiatives. They necessitate real-time power management (PM) for
   dynamic reconfiguration to support system critical operations in the
   event of dynamic load change or IPS component failures. The nonlinear,
   large scale trajectory optimization problem associated with IPS, along
   with the non-analytical nature of IPS model, makes many existing methods
   inadequate in meeting the real-time requirements. In this paper, we
   develop a methodology that exploits time scale separation, a
   characteristic associated with IPS dynamics, to achieve real-time
   optimization. In parallel, a dynamic model of the IPS with gas turbine
   and fuel cell as power plants is developed that captures the relevant
   dynamics but is simple enough for real-time optimization. The tradeoffs
   between the computational efficiency and optimization accuracy are
   analyzed. The optimization results for IPS PM on a real-time simulator
   are reported, which illustrate the real-time feasibility of the proposed
   optimization strategy.}},

Abstract = {{To address the constraint violation and feasibility issues of model
   predictive control (MPC) for ship heading control in wave fields, a
   novel disturbance compensating MPC (DC-MPC) algorithm has been proposed
   to satisfy the state constraints in the presence of environmental
   disturbances. The capability of the novel DC-MPC algorithm is first
   analyzed. Then, the proposed DC-MPC algorithm is applied to solve the
   ship heading control problem, and its performance is compared with a
   modified MPC controller, which considers the estimated disturbance in
   the optimization directly. The simulation results show good performance
   of the proposed controller in terms of reducing heading error and
   satisfying yaw velocity and actuator saturation constraints. The DC-MPC
   algorithm has the potential to be applied to other motion control
   problems with environmental disturbances, such as flight, automobile,
   and robotics control.}},

Abstract = {{In order to address the resource service optimal-selection (RSOS) and
   composition problem in manufacturing grid (MGrid) system and provide
   high-quality service to users, an MGrid RSOS and composition framework
   (MGrid-RSOSCF) is investigated in this study. The process of RSOS and
   composition is divided into the following five steps in MGrid-RSOSCF:
   (1) decomposing the submitted manufacturing task into several subtasks
   (i.e. single resource service requested task) if the submitted task is a
   multiple resource service requested task; (2) searching out the
   qualified resource service for each decomposed subtask and generating
   the corresponding candidate resource service set; (3) retrieving,
   evaluating and comparing the quality of service (QoS) for each candidate
   resource service, and provide data for service optimal-selection and
   composition - if the submitted task is a single resource service
   requested task; (4) evaluating synthetically the overall quality of each
   candidate resource service and ranking them, and selecting the optimal
   one for the task - if the submitted manufacturing task is an multiple
   resource service requested task; (5) selecting one candidate resource
   service from each candidate resource service set and constructing a new
   composite resource service according to the submitted task requirements,
   and collecting all the possible resource service composite execution
   paths (RSCEP) and selecting the optimal paths to execute the task. The
   proposed MGrid-RSOSCF consists of five layers and each layer provides
   the corresponding necessary services and algorithms to address one
   problem mentioned above. The five layers are: (1) T-layer, responsible
   for MGrid task decomposition; (2) S-layer, responsible for resource
   service match and search; (3) Q-layer, responsible for QoS processing;
   (4) O-layer, responsible for evaluating and ranking the candidate
   resource service and (5) C-layer is responsible for resource service
   composition and optimal-selection. The case study and comparison of
   performances of the algorithms demonstrate that the proposed methods are
   sound on success rate and executing efficiency.}},

Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{312-326}},
Abstract = {{This article proposes a new method to develop multiscale monitoring
   control charts for an autocorrelated process that has an underlying
   unknown ARMA(2, 1) model structure. The Haar wavelet transform is used
   to obtain effective monitoring statistics by considering the process
   dynamic characteristics in both the time and frequency domains. Three
   control charts are developed on three selected levels of Haar wavelet
   coefficients in order to simultaneously detect the changes in the
   process mean, process variance, and measurement error variance,
   respectively. A systematic method for automatically determining the
   optimal monitoring level of Haar wavelet decomposition is proposed that
   does not require the estimation of an ARMA model. It is shown that the
   proposed wavelet-based Cumulative SUM (CUSUM) chart on Haar wavelet
   detail coefficients is only sensitive to the variance changes and robust
   to process mean shifts. This property provides the separate monitoring
   capability between a variance change and a mean shift, which shows its
   advantage by comparison with the traditional CUSUM monitoring chart. For
   the purpose of mean shift detection, it is also shown that using the
   proposed wavelet-based Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)
   chart to monitor Haar wavelet scale coefficients will more successfully
   detect small mean shifts than direct-EWMA charts.}},

Title = {{Optimal control of an assembly system with demand for the end-product
   and intermediate components}},
Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{386-403}},
Abstract = {{This article considers the production and admission control decisions
   for a two-stage manufacturing system where intermediate components are
   produced to stock in the first stage and an end-product is assembled
   from these components through a second-stage assembly operation. The
   firmfaces two types of demand. The demand for the end-product is
   satisfied immediately if there are available products in inventory while
   the firm has the option to accept the order for later delivery or to
   reject it when no inventory is available. Demand for intermediate
   components may be accepted or rejected to keep components available for
   assembly purposes. The structure of demand admission, component
   production and product assembly decisions are characterized. The
   proposed model is extended to take into account multiple customer
   classes and a more general revenue collecting scheme where only an
   upfront partial payment is collected if a customer demand is accepted
   for future delivery with the remaining revenue received upon delivery.
   Since the optimal policy structure is rather complex and defined by
   switching surfaces in a multidimensional space, a simple heuristic
   policy is proposed for which the computational load grows linearly with
   the number of products and its performance is tested under a variety of
   example problems.}},

Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},

Pages = {{431-439}},
Abstract = {{Reciprocal mechanical interactions between cells and the extracellular
   matrix (ECM) are thought to play important instructive roles in
   branching morphogenesis. However, most studies to date have failed to
   characterize these interactions on a length scale relevant to cells,
   especially in three-dimensional (3D) matrices. Here we utilized two
   complementary methods, spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy
   (STICS) and laser optical tweezers-based active microrheology (AMR), to
   quantify endothelial cell (EC)-mediated deformations of individual ECM
   elements and the local ECM mechanical properties, respectively, during
   the process of capillary morphogenesis in a 3D cell culture model. In
   experiments in which the ECM density was systematically varied, STICS
   revealed that the rate at which ECs deformed individual ECM fibers on
   the microscale positively correlated with capillary sprouting on the
   macroscale. ECs expressing constitutively active V14-RhoA displaced
   individual matrix fibers at significantly faster rates and displayed
   enhanced capillary sprouting relative to wild-type cells, while those
   expressing dominant-negative N19-RhoA behaved in an opposite fashion. In
   parallel, AMR revealed a local stiffening of the ECM proximal to the
   tips of sprouting ECs. By quantifying the dynamic physical properties of
   the cell-ECM interface in both space and time, we identified a
   correlation linking ECM deformation rates and local ECM stiffening at
   the microscale with capillary morphogenesis at the macroscale.}},

   flow model, were considered. Results were obtained in terms of
   streamlines, velocity vectors, and pressure distribution for various
   Reynolds numbers and Darcy numbers. The results from this investigation

Abstract = {{By 2012, point of care (POC) testing will constitute roughly one third
   of the \$59 billion in vitro diagnostics market. The ability to carry
   out multiplexed genetic testing and wireless connectivity are emerging
   as key attributes of future POC devices. In this study, an inexpensive,
   user-friendly and compact device (termed Gene-Z) is presented for rapid
   quantitative detection of multiple genetic markers with high sensitivity
   and specificity. Using a disposable valve-less polymer microfluidic chip
   containing four arrays of 15 reaction wells each with dehydrated primers
   for isothermal amplification, the Gene-Z enables simultaneous analysis
   of four samples, each for multiple genetic markers in parallel,
   requiring only a single pipetting step per sample for dispensing. To
   drastically reduce the cost and size of the real-time detector necessary
   for quantification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was
   performed with a high concentration of SYTO-81, a non-inhibiting
   fluorescent DNA binding dye. The Gene-Z is operated using an iPod Touch,
   which also receives data and carries out automated analysis and
   reporting via a WiFi interface. This study presents data pertaining to
   performance of the device including sensitivity and reproducibility
   using genomic DNA from Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
   Overall, the Gene-Z represents a significant step toward truly
   inexpensive and compact tools for POC genetic testing.}},

Abstract = {{We present a microscopic theory that describes the ordering of two

   predicts that when one type of ligand is significantly bulkier than all

   these predictions. We show that the intrinsic conformational entropy of
   the ligands stabilizes this novel edge-aligned phase.}},

Journal = {{PHOTOCHEMICAL \& PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{653-660}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticle (NP)-based targeted drug delivery involves cell-specific
   targeting followed by a subsequent therapeutic action from the
   therapeutic carried by the NP system. NPs conjugated with methotrexate
   (MTX), a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) localized in
   cytosol, have been under investigation as a delivery system to target
   cancer cells to enhance the therapeutic index of methotrexate, which is
   otherwise non-selectively cytotoxic. Despite improved therapeutic
   activity from MTX-conjugated NPs in vitro and in vivo, the therapeutic
   action of these conjugates following cellular entry is poorly
   understood; in particular it is unclear whether the therapeutic activity
   requires release of the MTX. This study investigates whether MTX must be
   released from a nanoparticle in order to achieve the therapeutic
   activity. We report herein light-controlled release of methotrexate from
   a dendrimer-based conjugate and provide evidence suggesting that MTX
   still attached to the nanoconjugate system is fully able to inhibit the
   activity of its enzyme target and the growth of cancer cells.}},

Title = {{North American CO2 exchange: inter-comparison of modeled estimates with
   results from a fine-scale atmospheric inversion}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{457-475}},
Abstract = {{Atmospheric inversion models have the potential to quantify CO2 fluxes
   at regional, sub-continental scales by taking advantage of near-surface
   CO2 mixing ratio observations collected in areas with high flux
   variability. This study presents results from a series of regional
   geostatistical inverse models (GIM) over North America for 2004, and
   uses them as the basis for an inter-comparison to other inversion
   studies and estimates from biospheric models collected through the North
   American Carbon Program Regional and Continental Interim Synthesis.
   Because the GIM approach does not require explicit prior flux estimates
   and resolves fluxes at fine spatiotemporal scales (i.e. 1 degrees x 1
   degrees, 3-hourly in this study), it avoids temporal and spatial
   aggregation errors and allows for the recovery of realistic spatial
   patterns from the atmospheric data relative to previous inversion
   studies. Results from a GIM inversion using only available atmospheric
   observations and a fine-scale fossil fuel inventory were used to confirm
   the quality of the inventory and inversion setup. An inversion
   additionally including auxiliary variables from the North American
   Regional Reanalysis found inferred relationships with flux consistent
   with physiological understanding of the biospheric carbon cycle.
   Comparison of GIM results with bottom-up biospheric models showed
   stronger agreement during the growing relative to the dormant season, in
   part because most of the biospheric models do not fully represent
   agricultural land-management practices and the fate of both residual
   biomass and harvested products. Comparison to earlier inversion studies
   pointed to aggregation errors as a likely source of bias in previous
   subcontinental scale flux estimates, particularly for inversions that
   adjust fluxes at the coarsest scales and use atmospheric observations
   averaged over long periods. Finally, whereas the continental CO2
   boundary conditions used in the GIM inversions have a minor impact on
   spatial patterns, they have a substantial impact on the continental
   carbon budget, with a difference of 0.8 PgC yr(-1) in the total
   continental flux resulting from the use of two plausible sets of
   boundary CO2 mixing ratios. Overall, this inter-comparison study helps
   to assess the state of the science in estimating regional-scale CO2
   fluxes, while pointing towards the path forward for improvements in
   future top-down and bottom-up modeling efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of polymeric additives on molecular gelation was explored
   using poly(acrylic acid) and pyridine-based gelators. A significant
   reduction in the critical gel concentration (cgc) and an increase in gel
   strength were observed when the polymer was present during gel
   formation. Detailed studies revealed that the polymer is adsorbing onto
   the growing fibers, reducing the growth rates, and leading to thinner
   fibers. These and other morphological changes lead to improved gel
   properties by increasing the number of fiber-fiber entanglements.
   Several other polymers were briefly examined and these studies revealed
   that polymer structure is important. The polymer containing a
   complementary functional group relative to the gelator (e.g., H-bond
   donor/acceptor) provided the lowest cgc.}},

   for cancer cell targeting}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{560-572}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Cancer-targeting drug delivery can be based on the rational design of a
   therapeutic platform. This approach is typically achieved by the
   functionalization of a nanoparticle with two distinct types of
   molecules, a targeting ligand specific for a cancer cell, and a
   cytotoxic molecule to kill the cell. The present study aims to evaluate
   the validity of an alternative simplified approach in the design of
   cancer-targeting nanotherapeutics: conjugating a single type of molecule
   with dual activities to nanoparticles, instead of coupling a pair of
   orthogonal molecules. Herein we investigate whether this strategy can be
   validated by its application to methotrexate, a dual-acting small
   molecule that shows cytotoxicity because of its potent inhibitory
   activity against dihydrofolate reductase and that binds folic acid
   receptor, a tumor biomarker frequently upregulated on the cancer cell
   surface. This article describes a series of dendrimer conjugates derived
   from a generation 5 polyamidoamine (G5 PAMAM) presenting a multivalent
   array of methotrexate and also demonstrates their dual biological
   activities by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, a cell-free enzyme
   assay, and cell-based experiments with KB cancer cells. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The effects of different aspects of working hours on performance,
   including length of work and rest periods, time of day, and amount of
   set overtime, have been studied separately by scholars from different
   disciplines, including construction. Most of these studies have
   accounted for specific factors and for specific types of work. Current
   approaches fall short of enabling a work manager to estimate the impact
   of various working-hour arrangements on productivity with a reasonable
   degree of accuracy. We have developed a dynamic modeling tool that can
   be used for estimating expected productivity in a range of construction
   jobs for different working-hour arrangements. Through this dynamic
   modeling tool, construction managers can see the expected effects of
   working-hour changes on productivity and adjust work-hour schedules to
   improve productivity. To test the applicability of the model, it has
   been applied to a real construction case, and the effects of different
   working-hour arrangements on productivity have been investigated. DOI:

Abstract = {{In a design and construction project, non-value-adding effort (NVAE;
   also called non-value-adding activities) is wasted effort that could
   have been avoided if the project had been more carefully planned,
   executed, monitored, and controlled. NVAE is considered the main
   contributor to schedule delays and cost overruns in design and
   construction projects. Microlevel analyses such as work sampling and
   resource balance charts have been applied extensively to identify and
   minimize NVAE. These methods can pinpoint unnecessary steps in a highly
   repetitive construction activity and are most effective when analyzing
   activities with low performance variation in each cycle. However,
   microlevel analyses lack the capabilities to deal with errors and
   changes that usually result in significant performance variations,
   although they are a major trigger of NVAE in design and construction
   projects. To address this deficiency, this paper outlines the
   development of a system dynamics-based model for analysis on a
   macrolevel. The model's application to a bridge project in Massachusetts
   revealed that it can effectively identify and quantify NVAE particularly
   triggered by errors and changes, and can capture the propagation of NVAE
   between interrelated activities. On the basis of results, this paper
   concluded that the developed model can be utilized as a management tool
   to bring a more comprehensive understanding of NVAE in design and
   construction projects, which in turn can lead to a greater reduction in
   NVAE. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000406. (C) 2012 American Society

Abstract = {{Deep geological disposal concept is considered to be the most preferable
   for isolating high-level radioactive waste (HLW), including nuclear
   spent fuels, from the biosphere in a safe manner. The purpose of deep
   geological disposal of HLW is to isolate radioactive waste and to
   inhibit its release of for a long time, so that its toxicity does not
   affect the human beings and the biosphere. One of the most important
   requirements of HLW repository design for a deep geological disposal
   system is to keep the buffer temperature below 100 degrees C in order to
   maintain the integrity of the engineered barrier system. In this study,
   a reference disposal concept for spent nuclear fuels in Korea has been
   reviewed, and based on this concept, efficient alternative concepts that
   consider modified CANDU spent fuels disposal canister, were developed.
   To meet the thermal requirement of the disposal system, the spacing of
   the disposal tunnels and that of the disposal pits for each alternative
   concept, were drawn following heat transfer analyses. From the result of
   the thermal analyses, the disposal efficiency of the alternative
   concepts was reviewed and the most effective concept suggested. The
   results of these analyses can be used for a deep geological repository
   design and detailed analyses, based on exact site characteristics data,
   will reduce the uncertainty of the results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The thermomechanical behavior of damaged space shuttle tile thermal
   protection system (TPS) is simulated using the finite-element method.
   The effects of damage on the thermal protection capability and the
   induced thermal stresses in the TPS are evaluated by comparing the
   thermal and structural response of the damaged configurations with the
   undamaged configurations. The TPS consists of three components (the
   LI-900 tile, the strain isolation pad, and the underlying structure),
   and it is modeled as a discrete, three-layer structure. The TPS is
   subjected to the reentry heating and pressure profile corresponding to
   the Access to Space vehicle. The transient temperature distribution and
   the resultant thermal stresses are then computed. Three different sizes
   of damage simulating hypervelocity impact are considered. The validity
   of the simplifying assumptions used in an earlier study is
   systematically examined to determine the correct combination of
   assumptions required for modeling this class of problems. Influence of
   damage location on TPS response is also studied and it is concluded that
   centrally located damage represents a worst-case scenario. DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper presents the investigation of a multifunctional energy
   harvesting and energy-storage wing spar for unmanned aerial vehicles.
   Multifunctional material systems combine several functionalities into a
   single device in order to increase performance while limiting mass and
   volume. Multifunctional energy harvesting can be used to provide power
   to remote low-power sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles, where the added
   weight or volume of conventional harvesting designs can hinder flight
   performance. In this paper, a prototype self-charging wing spar
   containing embedded piezoelectric and battery elements is modeled,
   fabricated, and tested to evaluate its energy harvesting and storage
   performance. A coupled electromechanical model based on the assumed
   modes method is developed to predict the vibration response and voltage
   response of a cantilevered wing spar excited under harmonic base
   excitation. Experiments are performed on a representative self-charging
   wing spar, and the results are used to verify the electromechanical
   model. The power-generation performance of the self-charging wing spar
   is investigated in detail for harmonic excitation in clamped free
   boundary conditions. Experiments are also conducted to demonstrate the
   ability of the wing spar to simultaneously harvest and store electrical
   energy in a multifunctional manner. It is shown that, for an input base
   acceleration level of +/- 0.25 g at 28.4 Hz at the base of the
   structure, 1.5 mW of regulated dc power is delivered from the
   piezoelectric layers to the thin-film battery, resulting in a stored
   capacity of 0.362 mAh in 1 h.}},

Title = {{An Energy Conservation Algorithm for Nonlinear Dynamic Equation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{An energy conservation algorithm for numerically solving nonlinear
   multidegree-of-freedom (MDOF) dynamic equations is proposed. Firstly, by
   Taylor expansion and Duhamel integration, an integral iteration formula
   for numerically solving the nonlinear problems can be achieved. However,
   this formula still includes a parameter that is to be determined.
   Secondly, through some mathematical manipulations, the original
   dynamical equation can be further converted into an energy conservation
   equation which can then be used to determine the unknown parameter.
   Finally, an accurate numerical result for the nonlinear problem is
   achieved by substituting this parameter into the integral iteration
   formula. Several examples are used to compare the current method with
   the well-known Runge-Kutta method. They all show that the energy
   conservation algorithm introduced in this study can eliminate algorithm
   damping inherent in the Runge-Kutta algorithm and also has better
   stability for large integral steps.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to monitor machining processes within micron level is
   critical to high precision manufacturing. New non-contact measurement
   technology, such as holography based high definition metrology (HDM),
   makes this feasible through monitoring of both the part shape and its
   surface texture. However, conventional statistical process monitoring
   and diagnostic schemes based on low definition measurement technology
   have limitations in addressing the HDM data since such data are in
   high-dimensional form and may show strong spatial correlation. Based on
   a previously published sequential strategy for global and localized
   monitoring of shape variations in HDM data, this paper improves the
   method by refining the localized monitoring scheme, and applies the
   method to HDM data collected from an automotive engine head machining
   process. The results show that the proposed HDM monitoring scheme can
   effectively localize the defective regions on the out-of-control parts.

Abstract = {{We report results from a systematic study of the gasification of the
   alga Nannochloropsis sp. in supercritical water at 450-550 degrees C.
   The gaseous products were mainly H-2, CO2, and CH4, with lesser amounts
   of CO, C2H4, and C2H6. Higher temperatures, longer reaction times,
   higher water densities, and lower algae loadings provided higher gas
   yields. The algae loading strongly affected the H-2 yield, which more
   than tripled when the loading was reduced from 15 wt\% to 1 wt\%. The
   water density had little effect on the gas composition. The temporal
   variation of intermediate products indicated that some (e.g., alkanes)
   reacted quickly whereas others (aromatics) reacted more slowly. On the
   basis of this observation and the complete set of experimental results,
   we propose a global reaction network for algae SCWG that includes
   parallel primary pathways to each of these two types of intermediate
   products. The intermediate products then produce gases. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Capillary forces provide a ubiquitous means of organizing micro-and
   nanoscale structures on substrates. In order to investigate the
   mechanism of capillary self-assembly and to fabricate complex ordered
   structures, precise control of the meniscus shape is needed. We present
   a precision instrument that enables deposition of liquid droplets
   spanning from 2 n1 to 300 mu l, in concert with mechanical manipulation
   of the liquid-substrate interface with four degrees of freedom. The
   substrate has sub-100 nm positioning resolution in three axes of
   translation, and its temperature is controlled using thermoelectric
   modules. The capillary tip can rotate about the vertical axis while
   simultaneously dispensing liquid onto the substrate. Liquid is displaced
   using a custom bidirectional diaphragm pump, in which an elastic
   membrane is hydraulically actuated by a stainless steel syringe. The
   syringe is driven by a piezoelectric actuator, enabling nanoliter volume
   and rate control. A quantitative model of the liquid dispenser is
   verified experimentally, and suggests that compressibility in the
   hydraulic line deamplifles the syringe stroke, enabling sub-nanoliter
   resolution control of liquid displacement at the capillary tip. We use
   this system to contact-print water and oil droplets by mechanical
   manipulation of a liquid bridge between the capillary and the substrate.
   Finally, we study the effect of droplet volume and substrate temperature
   on the evaporative self-assembly of monodisperse polymer microspheres
   from sessile droplets, and demonstrate the formation of 3D chiral
   assemblies of micro-rods by rotation of the capillary tip during
   evaporative assembly. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   AMORPHOUS MATERIALS}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR MULTISCALE COMPUTATIONAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{109-116}},
Abstract = {{Ion beam experiments have revealed an intriguing observation that a
   nanoscale porous structure containing uniformly sized nanofibers can
   form spontaneously in preamorphized germanium. Depending on the ion
   energy and ion dose, the nanoporous fiber assembly can either be exposed
   from the sample surface or embedded under an intact surface cover. This
   paper proposes a phase field model that describes the dynamic process
   for the formation of such a structure in an amorphous matrix. In this
   model, vacancies in an amorphous matrix are defined by local reduction
   of atomic density relative to the reference solid before irradiation,
   and the cavity is treated as a phase with the vacancy concentration
   close to one. It is shown that interface migration together with the
   competing actions between vacancy production and annihilation determines
   the morphology of irradiated material. The model suggests that with
   continuous supply of vacancies through increasing irradiation doses, the
   morphology evolves into a network structure composed of nearly uniform
   sizes of nanofibers. The morphology and characteristic wavelength
   predicted by the model are consistent with experimental observations.
   The model also well predicts the effects of ion flux, temperature, and
   material properties on the unique nanostructure evolution under
   irradiation.}},

Title = {{A Gene Regulatory Network for Root Epidermis Cell Differentiation in
   Arabidopsis}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The root epidermis of Arabidopsis provides an exceptional model for
   studying the molecular basis of cell fate and differentiation. To obtain
   a systems-level view of root epidermal cell differentiation, we used a
   genome-wide transcriptome approach to define and organize a large set of
   genes into a transcriptional regulatory network. Using cell fate mutants
   that produce only one of the two epidermal cell types, together with
   fluorescence-activated cell-sorting to preferentially analyze the root
   epidermis transcriptome, we identified 1,582 genes differentially
   expressed in the root-hair or non-hair cell types, including a set of
   208 ``core{''} root epidermal genes. The organization of the core genes
   into a network was accomplished by using 17 distinct root epidermis
   mutants and 2 hormone treatments to perturb the system and assess the
   effects on each gene's transcript accumulation. In addition, temporal
   gene expression information from a developmental time series dataset and
   predicted gene associations derived from a Bayesian modeling approach
   were used to aid the positioning of genes within the network. Further, a
   detailed functional analysis of likely bHLH regulatory genes within the
   network, including MYC1, bHLH54, bHLH66, and bHLH82, showed that three
   distinct subfamilies of bHLH proteins participate in root epidermis
   development in a stage-specific manner. The integration of genetic,
   genomic, and computational analyses provides a new view of the
   composition, architecture, and logic of the root epidermal
   transcriptional network, and it demonstrates the utility of a
   comprehensive systems approach for dissecting a complex regulatory
   network.}},

Abstract = {{The way in which a vehicle is driven significantly affects its fuel
   consumption. This paper analyses the fuel-optimal driving strategies of
   a traditional vehicle equipped with a continuously variable transmission
   in car-following scenarios. A minimal-fuel-consumption problem is
   formulated, which is numerically solved using the Gauss pseudospectral
   method. The identified optimal manoeuvres were found to demonstrate two
   types of behaviour depending on the vehicle speed: pulse-and-gliding
   (PnG) and constant speed (CS). Further analyses indicate that the
   difference in behaviours mainly depends on the engine fuelling
   characteristics (both static and transient) and the road load. As the
   preceding vehicle's speed increases, the optimal manoeuvre changes from
   partial PnG to full PnG, and finally to CS. In the full-PnG strategy,
   the engine switches between the minimum brake specific fuel consumption
   point and the idling point while the range error oscillates between its
   upper and lower bounds. The period, duty cycle percentage, and fuel
   economy improvement of the PnG strategy are analysed and presented.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},

Pages = {{110-132}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the fact that delay difference inclusions (DDIs) form a
   rich modeling class that includes, for example, uncertain time-delay
   systems and certain types of networked control systems, this paper
   provides a comprehensive collection of Lyapunov methods for DDIs. First,
   the Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach, which is an extension of the classical
   Lyapunov theory to time-delay systems, is considered. It is shown that a
   DDI is KL-stable if and only if it admits a Lyapunov-Krasovskii function
   (LKF). Second, the Lyapunov-Razumikhin method, which is a type of
   small-gain approach for time-delay systems, is studied. It is proved
   that a DDI is KL-stable if it admits a Lyapunov-Razumikhin function
   (LRF). Moreover, an example of a linear delay difference equation which
   is globally exponentially stable but does not admit an LRF is provided.
   Thus, it is established that the existence of an LRF is not a necessary
   condition for KL-stability of a DDI. Then, it is shown that the
   existence of an LRF is a sufficient condition for the existence of an
   LKF and that only under certain additional assumptions is the converse
   true. Furthermore, it is shown that an LRF induces a family of sets with
   certain contraction properties that are particular to time-delay
   systems. On the other hand, an LKF is shown to induce a type of
   contractive set similar to those induced by a classical Lyapunov
   function. The class of quadratic candidate functions is used to
   illustrate the results derived in this paper in terms of both LKFs and
   LRFs, respectively. Both stability analysis and stabilizing controller
   synthesis methods for linear DDIs are proposed.}},

Volume = {{159}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{A492-A498}},
Abstract = {{In order to achieve a high level of reliability in rechargeable Li-ion
   batteries, battery cell materials must maintain good mechanical
   stability over many cycles. Stresses due to intercalation, phase
   transition, and thermal loading can cause local fractures in the active
   materials of Li-ion batteries, as has been experimentally observed. The
   resulting fracture of the cathode materials is one putative degradation
   mechanism of Li batteries; it inevitably results in a loss of electrical
   contact and an increase in the surface area for active material
   dissolution and SEI layer formation. In this work, we investigate the
   conditions under which initial defects propagate and form larger
   fractures in the cathode material (LiMn2O4) during the charging and
   discharging cycles of electrochemical reactions. Fracture analysis based
   on the extended finite element method (XFEM) is used to evaluate the
   effects of current density, particle size and particle aspect ratio on
   the propagation of defects. Both current density and particle size are
   shown to be positively correlated with fracture propagation, though not
   monotonically so in the case of aspect ratio. With an aspect ratio of
   1.5: 1, a particle with a defect at the center will crack at a low
   C-rate; this case is one of the most severe among all aspect ratios. (C)

   ultimate failure of deck plate, a reliability-based procedure for
   inspection planning is introduced. A review of the uncertainties in
   deriving the capacity of deck plate and through life degradation effects

   sampling method to perform the Monte Carlo Simulation, the time-variant
   failure probabilities of deck plate are computed, then compared with
   target values. Based on the comparison, the time for thickness
   measurement of deck plate is predicted. A total of 1080 cases for nine
   sample tankers are analyzed to illustrate the procedure, including
   sensitivity and parametric studies. This paper is a sequel to the

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{62-71}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A model problem of the flow under an air-cushion vessel is studied. Two
   different numerical techniques are used to determine the solution of the
   free-surface elevation and the wave resistance for a range of Froude
   number, Reynolds number, value of the pressure applied in the cushion,
   and depth of the water. The first numerical technique uses a velocity
   potential that satisfies linearized free-surface boundary conditions,
   whereas the second employs a finite-volume method to find a solution
   that satisfies the fully nonlinear free-surface boundary conditions. The
   results clearly show that for high Froude number and practical values of
   the cushion pressure, the linear-theory solution is in excellent
   agreement with the more exact nonlinear prediction. For lower Froude
   number the solution becomes unsteady, and the disagreement between the
   two methods is larger. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Cavitation inception during the interaction of a pair of
   counter-rotating vortices}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Pairs of unequal strength, counter-rotating vortices were produced to
   examine the inception and dynamics of vortex cavitation as the vortices
   undergo a long-wavelength instability. The instability causes the
   weaker, secondary vortex to be turned and stretched by the stronger
   primary vortex. Folding and stretching of the secondary vortices result
   in sharp reductions of the core pressure. Here, these sharp and
   transient reductions in the secondary vortex core pressure produced
   incipient cavitation at static pressures that were as much as 20 times
   higher than that required for inception in the core of the unstretched
   secondary vortex. In addition, the majority of nuclei measured was of
   the order of 1 mu m in size, which requires tension on the order of 100
   kPa for cavitation inception to occur. The flow parameters that lead to
   the instability and cavitation inception in the secondary vortex are
   examined, and the measured event rates are correlated to freestream
   nuclei populations and static pressure. These measurements, combined
   with observations of the elongated bubbles themselves, suggest that
   stretching produced large tensions in the core of the secondary vortex
   due to both a reduction in the secondary vortex core size and the
   creation of a jetting flow in the vortex core. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{Design of online auctions: Proxy versus non-proxy settings}},
Journal = {{DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{384-394}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of online auctions.
   Currently, some online auctions, such as eBay, introduce a proxy bidding
   policy, under which bidders submit their maximum bids and delegate to a
   proxy agent to automatically outbid other competitors for the top
   bidder, whereas other online auctions do not. This paper compares these
   two widely used auction mechanisms (proxy setting and non-proxy setting)
   and characterizes the equilibrium bidding behavior and the seller's
   expected revenue. We find the proxy auction outperforms the non-proxy
   auction in terms of the seller's expected revenue. This dominance result
   is not prone to the specific bid announcement policy, the bidder's
   knowledge regarding the number of bidders, the impact of traffic
   congestion along the bidding process, the number of items sold through
   the auction, and the existence of a reserve price.
   We further find that the proxy setting usually fails to sustain the
   truthful bidding as a dominant strategy equilibrium even if no minimum
   bid increments are adopted, and the possibility of a
   low-valuation-bidder dilemma where the low-valuation bidders could be
   better off if all bidders collude to bid at the last minute. We also
   discuss the dramatically different equilibrium bidding behaviors under
   the two auction mechanisms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   propensity through assembly pathway engineering}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2852-2859}},
Abstract = {{Self-assembly holds promise for creating new materials and devices
   because of its inherent parallelism, allowing many building blocks to
   simultaneously organize using preprogrammed interactions. An important
   trend in nanoparticle and colloid science is the synthesis of particles
   with unusual shapes and/or directional ({''}patchy'') interactions,
   whose anisotropy allows, in principle, assemblies of unprecedented
   complexity. However, patchy particles are more prone to long relaxation
   times during thermodynamically driven assembly, and there is no a priori
   way of predicting which particles might be good assembly candidates.
   Here we demonstrate a new conceptual approach to predict this
   information using sequences of intermediate clusters that appear during
   assembly. We demonstrate our approach on a family of model building
   blocks as well as a real system of CdTe/CdS tetrahedra and find design
   rules for engineering the optimized assembly of target structures.}},

   rapid, reliable, and ultrasensitive analyte detection. The unique
   configuration not only provides 3-dimensional geometry for significantly
   increased SERS-active area and inherent fluidic channels for rapid and
   efficient sample delivery, but also confines and transmits light along
   the capillary for large SERS signal accumulation. Using a capillary
   consisting of thousands of micrometer-sized holes adsorbed with gold
   nanoparticles, we Investigated the proposed optofluidic SERS system
   using the transverse and longitudinal detection methods, where the SERS
   excitation and collection were perpendicular to and along the capillary,
   respectively. A detection limit better than 100 NI for rhodamine 6G was

Abstract = {{Polyhedra and their arrangements have intrigued humankind since the
   ancient Greeks and are today Important motifs in condensed matter, with
   application to many classes of liquids and solids. Yet, little Is known
   about the thermodynamically stable phases of polyhedrally shaped
   building blocks, such as faceted nanoparticles and colloids. Although
   hard particles are known to organize due to entropy alone, and some
   unusual phases are reported In the literature, the role of entropic
   forces in connection with polyhedral shape is not well understood. Here,
   we study thermodynamic self-assembly of a family of truncated tetrahedra
   and report several atomic crystal isostructures, including diamond,
   beta-tin, and high-pressure lithium, as the polyhedron shape varies from
   tetrahedral to octahedral. We compare our findings with the densest
   packings of the truncated tetrahedron family obtained by numerical
   compression and report a new space-filling polyhedron, which has been
   overlooked in previous searches. Interestingly, the self-assembled
   structures differ from the densest packings. We show that the
   self-assembled crystal structures can be understood as a tendency for
   polyhedra to maximize face-to-face alignment, which can be generalized
   as directional entropic forces.}},

   packing, thereby increasing hole transport and the possibility of
   forming extended nanocrystalline junctions when annealed.
   Nanocrystalline solar cells based on fSQ and a C-60 acceptor have V-oc =
   1.0 V and fill factors 0.73 +/- 0.01. Solar cells incorporating annealed
   1-NPSQ films result in a power conversion efficiency of 5.7 +/- 0.6\% at
   1 sun, AM1.5G illumination.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear piezoelectric effects in flexural energy harvesters have
   recently been demonstrated for drive amplitudes well within the scope of
   anticipated vibration environments for power generation. In addition to
   strong softening effects, steady-state oscillations are highly damped as
   well. Nonlinear fluid damping was previously employed to successfully
   model drive dependent decreases in frequency response due to the
   high-velocity oscillations, but this article instead harmonizes with a
   body of literature concerning weakly excited piezoelectric actuators by
   modeling nonlinear damping with nonconservative piezoelectric
   constitutive relations. Thus, material damping is presumed dominant over
   losses due to fluid-structure interactions. Cantilevers consisted of
   lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-5A and PZT-5H are studied, and the
   addition of successively larger proof masses is shown to precipitate
   nonlinear resonances at much lower base excitation thresholds while
   increasing the influence of higher-order nonlinearities. Parameter
   identification results using a multiple scales perturbation solution
   suggest that empirical trends are primarily due to higher-order elastic
   and dissipation nonlinearities and that modeling linear
   electromechanical coupling is sufficient. This article concludes with
   the guidelines for which utilization of a nonlinear model is preferred.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators in the wire form are attractive
   because of their simplistic architecture and electrical operation, and
   their manufacturability at high yields and low cost. While SMA actuators
   are known for their superior work density among smart materials,
   packaging long lengths of SMA wire needed for moderate to large motions
   is an ongoing technical challenge. This article investigates spooling as
   a packaging approach to provide more compact actuator footprints. An
   analytical, quasi-static model is derived to provide a foundational tool
   for the analysis and synthesis of spool-packaged SMA wire actuators. The
   model predicts motion with respect to a generalized architecture, and
   specifiable geometric, material, and loading parameters. The model
   prediction accounts for the effects of local friction loss and bending
   strains, and for a ``binding{''} limitation due to accumulated friction.
   An experimental validation study demonstrates the model's ability to
   predict actuator motion well in terms of form and magnitude with respect
   to load and packaging geometry. This model provides a basis for a
   systematic application of spooled-packaging techniques to overcome
   packaging limitations of SMA, positioning SMA wire actuators as a viable
   alternative in many applications.}},

Abstract = {{We developed and characterized a rapid, sensitive and integrated optical

   micrometre-thin vapor-sensitive polymer layer coated on a silicon wafer.
   The thickness and the refractive index of the polymer vary in response
   to the vapor analyte, resulting in a change in the reflected intensity
   of the laser impinged on the sensor. In our study, four different
   polymers were coated on four wells pre-etched on a silicon wafer to form
   a spatially separated sensor array. A CMOS imager was employed to
   simultaneously monitor the polymers' response, thus enabling multiplexed
   detection of a vapor analyte passing through the GC column. A sub-second
   detection time was demonstrated. In addition, a sub-picogram detection
   limit was achieved, representing orders of magnitude improvement over
   the on-chip vapor sensors previously reported.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{3140-3147}},
Abstract = {{The article reports the first quantitative kinetics model for
   supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of real biomass (algae) that
   describes the formation of the individual gaseous products. The
   phenomenological model is based on a set of reaction pathways that
   includes two types of compounds being intermediate between the algal
   biomass and the final gaseous products. To best correlate the
   experimental gas yields obtained at 450, 500 and 550 degrees C, the
   model allowed one type of intermediate to react to gases more quickly
   than the other type of intermediate. The model parameters indicate that
   gas yields increase with temperature because higher temperatures favor
   production of the more easily gasified intermediate and the production
   of gas at the expense of char. The model can accurately predict the
   qualitative influence of the biomass loading and water density on the
   gas yields. Sensitivity analysis and reaction rate analysis indicate
   that steam reforming of intermediates is an important source of H-2,
   whereas direct decomposition of the intermediate species is the main
   source of CO, CO2 and CH4.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic diffraction allows sound to travel around opaque objects and
   therefore may allow beyond-line-of-sight sensing of remote sound
   sources. This paper reports simulated and experimental results for
   localizing sound sources based on fully shadowed microphone array
   measurements. The generic geometry includes a point source, a solid 90
   degrees wedge, and a receiving array that lies entirely in the shadow
   defined by the source location and the wedge. Source localization
   performance is assessed via matched-field (MF) ambiguity surfaces as a
   function of receiving array configuration, and received signal-to-noise
   ratio for the Bartlett and minimum variance distortionless (MVD) MF
   processors. Here, the sound propagation model is developed from a
   Green's function integral treatment. A simple 16 element line array of
   microphones is tested in three mutually orthogonal orientations. The
   experiments were conducted using an approximate 50-to-1-scaled tabletop
   model of a blind city-street intersection and produced ambiguity
   surfaces from source frequencies between 17.5 and 19 kHz that were
   incoherently summed. The experimental results suggest that a sound
   source may be localized by the MVD processor when using fully shadowed
   arrays that have significant aperture parallel to the edge of the wedge.
   However, this performance is reduced significantly for signal-to-noise
   ratios below 40 dB. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Tannic acid, a nontoxic, easily biodegradable compound, is evaluated for
   scale inhibitor squeeze application in a sandstone reservoir. For this
   purpose, we designed a new inhibitor squeeze evaluation system, a
   combined core flood-tube blocking apparatus with appropriate
   pressure-temperature and data logging arrangement, that can simulate the
   near-wellbore reservoir as well as downhole locations. Berea sandstone
   core plugs represented the formation rock and the extended flow tube
   represented the wellbore. Backflow tests were conducted to measure scale
   precipitation within the core plug and wellbore flow restriction. A 10
   pore volume (PV) tannic acid solution was squeezed through the core plug
   and after a 14-hr adsorption period, anion and cation brines were
   squeezed separately through the core plug followed by the tube. The
   tests were compared with a control and a commonly used phosphonate scale
   inhibitor. The results showed that a fast rate of permeability reduction
   due to scale deposition took place in the control experiment starting at
   the initial brine injection stage and, in the case of the phosphonate
   scale inhibitor squeeze, there was significant reduction in permeability
   due to the squeeze itself. There was also progressive reduction of
   permeability due to less control of scaling phenomena. However, the
   tannic acid-treated core showed a slight improvement in core
   permeability and no scale deposition took place up to 250 PV of brine
   injection. Scanning electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma
   (ICP) studies explain the formation stimulating mechanism of this new
   scale inhibitor.}},

   water}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2900-2910}},
Abstract = {{We processed phenol with supercritical water in a series of experiments,
   which systematically varied the temperature, water density, reactant
   concentration, and reaction time. Both the gas and liquid phases were
   analyzed post-reaction using gas chromatographic techniques, which
   identified and quantified the reaction intermediates and products,
   including H-2, CO, CH4, and CO2 in the gas phase and twenty different
   compounds-mainly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons-in the liquid phase.
   Many of these liquid phase compounds were identified for the first time
   and could pose environmental risks. Higher temperatures promoted
   gasification and resulted in a product gas rich in H-2 and CH4 (33\% and
   29\%, respectively, at 700 degrees C), but char yields increased as
   well. We implicated dibenzofuran and other identified phenolic dimers as
   precursor molecules for char formation pathways, which can be driven by
   free radical polymerization at high temperatures. Examination of the
   trends in conversion as a function of initial water and phenol
   concentrations revealed competing effects, and these informed the
   kinetic modeling of phenol disappearance. Two different reaction
   pathways emerged from the kinetic modeling: one in which rate
   proportional to {[}phenol](1.73){[}water](-16.60) and the other in which
   rate proportional to {[}phenol](0.92){[}water](1.39). These pathways may
   correspond to pyrolysis, which dominates when there is abundant phenol
   and little water, and hydrothermal reactions, which dominate in excess
   water. This result confirms that supercritical water gasification of
   phenol does not simply follow first-order kinetics, as previous efforts
   to model phenol disappearance had assumed.}},

Abstract = {{Isolator-combustor interactions are measured in a direct-connect
   dual-mode ramjet-scramjet experiment. An operating point approach is
   used to create a mapping of the coupling effects between the isolator
   geometry, inlet flow conditions, and fuel injector behavior. The
   resulting isolator/injector coupling map provides a description of the
   response of the isolator to particular injector performance and the
   effective blockage it induces on the isolator flow. Existing models and
   correlations predicting the pressure rise across a pseudoshock and its
   resultant length were evaluated through comparison with measurements
   made in a heated-flow isolator duct that is coupled to a hydrogen-air
   combustor. The observation of a normal-to-oblique shock-train transition
   mechanism has led to the development of a revised shock-train operating
   regime description that takes into account the impact of Mach number and
   maximum pressure recovery on the shock configurations present in the
   isolator.}},

Title = {{Phase I Risk-Adjusted Control Charts for Monitoring Surgical Performance
   by Considering Categorical Covariates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-53}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In recent years risk-adjusted control charts have been increasingly
   studied for monitoring surgical outcomes by accounting for patients'
   health conditions prior to surgery. However, most existing research
   focuses on phase II monitoring, and very little work has been done on
   phase I control of surgical outcomes. In this paper, a general phase I
   risk-adjusted control chart is proposed for monitoring binary surgical
   outcomes based on a likelihood-ratio test derived from a change-point
   model. Different from the existing methods, this paper further shows
   that the binary surgical outcomes depend on not only the patient
   conditions described by the Parsonnet scores but also on other
   categorical operational covariates, such as different surgeons. The
   proposed risk-adjustment model is fitted by incorporating dummy
   variables to reflect different surgeon groups' performance. The analysis
   of a case study and simulation results show that the inclusion of
   surgeon groups as a categorical covariate in the risk-adjustment model
   can effectively reflect the inherent data heterogeneity, thus improving
   the estimation of the risk-adjustment model parameters. As expected, the
   proposed risk-adjusted control charts can achieve a better detection
   performance by including the surgeon covariate.}},

Pages = {{717-724}},
Abstract = {{The design, fabrication, and preliminary testing of a micromachined-Si
   passive vapor preconcentrator/injector (mPPI) are described. Intended
   for incorporation in a gas chromatographic microsystem (mu GC) for
   analyzing organic vapor mixtures, the mPPI captures vapors from the air
   at a known rate by means of passive diffusion (i.e., without pumping)
   and then desorbs the vapor sample thermally by means of an integrated
   heater and injects it downstream (with pumping). The mu PPI chip
   comprises a 1.8 mu L deep reactive-ion-etched (DRIE) Si cavity with a
   resistively heated membrane floor and a DRIE-Si cap containing > 1500
   parallel diffusion channels, each 54 x 54 x 200 mu m. The cavity is
   packed with 750 mu g of a commercial graphitized carbon adsorbent.
   Fluidic and heat-transfer modeling was used to guide the design process
   to ensure power-efficient sample transfer during thermal desorption.
   Experiments performed with toluene at concentrations of similar to 1 ppm
   gave a constant sampling rate of 9.1 mL min(-1) for up to 30 min, which
   is within 2\% of theoretical predictions and corresponds to a linear
   dynamic mass uptake range of similar to 1 mu g. The cavity membrane
   could be heated to 250 degrees C in 0.23 s with 1 W of applied power
   and, with 50 mL min(-1) of suction flow provided by a downstream pump,
   yielded >95\% desorption/injection efficiency of toluene samples over an
   8-fold range of captured mass.}},

   live-cell subcellular cytoskeletal response}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{731-740}},
Abstract = {{External forces are increasingly recognized as major regulators of
   cellular structure and function, yet the underlying mechanism by which
   cells sense forces and transduce them into intracellular biochemical
   signals and behavioral responses ('mechanotransduction') is largely
   undetermined. To aid in the mechanistic study of mechanotransduction,
   herein we devised a cell stretching device that allowed for quantitative
   control and real-time measurement of mechanical stimuli and cellular
   biomechanical responses. Our strategy involved a microfabricated array
   of silicone elastomeric microposts integrated onto a stretchable
   elastomeric membrane. Using a computer-controlled vacuum, this micropost
   array membrane (mPAM) was activated to apply equibiaxial cell stretching
   forces to adherent cells attached to the microposts. Using the mPAM, we
   studied the live-cell subcellular dynamic responses of contractile
   forces in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to a sustained static
   equibiaxial cell stretch. Our data showed that in response to a
   sustained cell stretch, VSMCs regulated their cytoskeletal (CSK)
   contractility in a biphasic manner: they first acutely enhanced their
   contraction to resist rapid cell deformation ('stiffening') before they
   allowed slow adaptive inelastic CSK reorganization to release their
   contractility ('softening'). The contractile response across entire
   single VSMCs was spatially inhomogeneous and force-dependent. Our mPAM
   device and live-cell subcellular contractile measurements will help
   elucidate the mechanotransductive system in VSMCs and thus contribute to
   our understanding of pressure-induced vascular disease processes.}},

Abstract = {{Image registration has been proposed as an automatic method for
   recovering cardiac displacement fields from tagged Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (tMRI) sequences. Initially performed as a set of pairwise
   registrations, these techniques have evolved to the use of 3D + t
   deformation models, requiring metrics of joint image alignment (JA).
   However, only linear combinations of cost functions defined with respect
   to the first frame have been used. In this paper, we have applied
   k-Nearest Neighbors Graphs (kNNG) estimators of the a-entropy (HA to
   measure the joint similarity between frames, and to combine the
   information provided by different cardiac views in an unified metric.
   Experiments performed on six subjects showed a significantly higher
   accuracy (p < 0.05) with respect to a standard pairwise alignment (PA)
   approach in terms of mean positional error and variance with respect to
   manually placed landmarks. The developed method was used to study
   strains in patients with myocardial infarction, showing a consistency
   between strain, infarction location, and coronary occlusion. This paper
   also presents an interesting clinical application of graph-based metric
   estimators, showing their value for solving practical problems found in
   medical imaging. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Activation of the striated urethral sphincter to maintain continence

Journal = {{NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Aims Function of the striated urethral sphincter (SUS) in men is
   debated. Current evidence is limited to electromyographic (EMG)
   recordings made with concentric needle electrodes in supine.
   Understanding of SUS function requires investigation of SUS EMG activity
   using new recording techniques in dynamic tasks. The aim of this study
   was to evaluate timing and amplitude of SUS EMG at rest and during
   dynamic tasks that challenge continence by increasing intra-abdominal
   pressure (IAP). Methods: Investigative study of five healthy men aged
   25-39 years. Measurements included SUS, anal sphincter (AS), and
   transversus abdominus (TrA) EMG, and IAP (recorded with a nasogastric
   pressure catheter). Participants performed four tasks that challenged
   postural control in standing (single and repetitive arm movement,
   stepping and load catching). Results: IAP amplitude and SUS activity
   were linearly correlated during repetitive arm movement (R(2):
   0.67-0.88). During stepping SUS EMG onset preceded the IAP increase, but
   followed it with rapid arm movements. When the trunk was loaded
   unpredictably onset of SUS generally followed the increase in IAP. The
   modest sample size meant only younger men were tested. Future studies
   might investigate healthy older men or those with certain pathologies.
   Conclusions: Data show that SUS activity increases proportionally with
   IAP. This provided evidence that SUS contributes to continence when IAP
   is increased, and that postural control of the trunk involves activation
   of this muscle. Neurourol. Urodynam. 31:36-43, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{Consideration of the environmental impact of aircraft has become
   critical in commercial aviation. The continued growth of air traffic has
   caused increasing demands to reduce aircraft emissions, imposing new
   constraints on the design and development of future airplane concepts.
   In this paper, an aircraft design optimisation framework is used to
   design aircraft that minimise specific environmental metrics.
   Multidisciplinary design optimisation is used to optimise aircraft by
   simultaneously considering airframe, engine and mission. The
   environmental metrics considered in this investigation are CO(2)
   emissions - which are proportional to fuel burn and - landing-takeoff
   NO(x) emissions. The results are compared to those of an aircraft with
   minimum direct operating cost. The design variables considered in the
   optimisation problems include aircraft geometry, engine parameters, and
   cruise settings. An augmented Lagrangian particle swarm optimiser and a
   genetic algorithm are used to solve the single objective and
   multi-objective optimisation problems, respectively.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We develop the stabilized extended boundary condition method (SEBCM)
   based on the classical EBCM to solve the 3-D vector electromagnetic
   scattering problem from arbitrary random rough surfaces. Similar to the
   classical EBCM, we expand the fields in terms of Floquet modes and match
   the extended boundary conditions at test surfaces away from the actual
   rough surface to retrieve the surface currents and therefore the
   scattered fields. However, to solve long-standing stability problems of
   the classical EBCM, we introduce a z-coordinate transformation to
   restrict and control the test surface locations explicitly. We also
   introduce the concepts of moderated test surface locations and balanced
   k-charts for further stabilization and optimization of the solutions.
   The computational efficiency is optimized by judicious submatrix
   decomposition. The resulting bistatic scattering cross sections are
   validated by comparing with analytical and numerical solutions.
   Specifically, the solutions are compared with those from the small
   perturbation method and small-slope approximation within their validity
   region, and with those from the method of moments outside the validity
   domains of analytical solutions. It is shown that SEBCM gives accurate,
   numerically efficient, full-wave solutions over a large range of surface
   roughnesses and medium losses, which are far beyond the validity range
   of analytical methods. These properties are expected to make SEBCM a
   competitive forward solver for soil moisture retrieval from radar
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Generation of combustion noise in an unconfined turbulent non-premixed
   flame is investigated. For this, a model is developed, combining
   Lighthill's acoustic analogy with a flamelet-based combustion model to
   consistently express all thermochemical quantities by a set of reduced
   scalars. The model is applied in a large-eddy simulation, and the
   acoustic pressure in the far field is obtained from an integral
   solution. Three relevant acoustic source terms with different source
   characteristics and Mach number scaling are identified. The spatial
   distribution and spectral characteristics of the acoustic sources are
   analyzed, and it is shown that the acoustic source due to chemical
   reaction is the main noise contributor, and is located in the upper part
   of the flame. Contributions from the acoustic sources due to Reynolds
   stresses and fluctuating mass flux are found to be virtually
   insignificant at low frequencies. Discrepancies in the prediction of
   high-frequency sound pressure level in the jet forward direction were
   analyzed and are attributed to high-frequency acoustic refraction
   effects due to variations in sound speed. The directivity exhibits a
   weak directionality in the 30 degrees forward direction, and some phase
   cancellation between individual acoustic sources is evident.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of controller design in linear systems is well understood.
   Often, however, when linear controllers are implemented on a physical
   system, the anticipated performance is not met. In some cases, this can
   be attributed to nonlinearities in the instrumentation, i.e., sensors
   and actuators. Intuition suggests that to compensate for this
   instrumentation, one can boost, i.e., increase, the controller gain.
   This paper formally pursues this strategy and develops the theory of
   boosting. It provides conditions under which the controller gain can be
   modified to offset the effects of instrumentation, thus recovering the
   performance of the intended linear design. Experimental verification of
   the technique developed is reported using a magnetic levitation device.

Title = {{A Co-Evolutionary Approach for Design Optimization via Ensembles of
   Surrogates With Application to Vehicle Crashworthiness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In many engineering application, where accurate models require lengthy
   numerical computations, it is a common design practice to perform design
   of experiments (DOE) and construct surrogate models that provide
   computationally-inexpensive approximations. Main challenges to that
   approach are (i) construction of high-fidelity surrogates and (ii)
   discovery of high performance designs despite the fidelity limitations.
   An ensemble of surrogates (EOS) is a collection of different surrogates
   approximating the same process (typically with some form of weighted
   averaging to get an overall approximation) and has been demonstrated in
   the literature to often exhibit better performance than any of the
   individual surrogates. This paper presents a Multi-Scenario
   Co-evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (MSCGA) for design optimization via
   EOS. MSCGA simultaneously evolves multiple populations in a
   multi-objective sense via the predicted performance by the different
   surrogates within the ensemble. The outputs of the algorithm are
   solution sets including several designs that are spread over
   Pareto-optimal space of best-predictions by the surrogates within EOS,
   as well as best designs as predicted by individual surrogates and the
   weighted average of the EOS. Studies using analytical test functions
   show MSCGA to be more likely to discover better performing designs than
   an individual surrogate or a weighted ensemble. The primary application
   for MSCGA presented in this paper is that of vehicle structural
   crashworthiness since it is a typical design application that requires
   massive computational resources for accurate modeling. Two studies,
   which include simplified and detailed vehicle models, MSCGA successfully
   discovers new high performance designs. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005439]}},

Abstract = {{Emerging evidence indicates that a small population of cancer cells is
   highly tumorigenic, endowed with self-renewal, and has the ability to
   differentiate into cells that constitute the bulk of tumors. These cells
   are considered the ``drivers{''} of the tumorigenic process in some
   tumor types, and have been named cancer stem cells.
   Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) appears to be involved in the
   process leading to the acquisition of stemness by epithelial tumor
   cells. Through this process, cells acquire an invasive phenotype that
   may contribute to tumor recurrence and metastasis. Cancer stem cells
   have been identified in human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
   (HNSCC) using markers such as CD133 and CD44 expression, and aldehyde
   dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. The head and neck cancer stem cells
   reside primarily in perivascular niches in the invasive front where
   endothelial-cell initiated events contribute to their survival and
   function. In this review, we discuss the state-of-the-knowledge on the
   pathobiology of cancer stem cells, with a focus on the impact of these
   cells to head and neck tumor progression. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {{26-32}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence demonstrated that cancer stem cells reside in close
   proximity to blood vessels in human head and neck squamous cell
   carcinomas (HNSCC). These findings suggest the existence of a supporting
   perivascular niche for cancer stem cells. The purpose of this study was
   to evaluate the effect of endothelial cell-secreted factors on the
   behavior of head and neck cancer stem-like cells (HNCSC). HNCSC were
   identified by sorting UM-SCC-22A (cell line derived from a primary
   squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx) and UM-SCC-22B (derived from
   the metastatic lymph node of the same patient) for CD44 expression and
   ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase) activity. HNCSC (ALDH+CD44+) and control
   (ALDH-CD44-) cells were cultured in ultra-low attachment plates in
   presence of conditioned medium from primary human endothelial cells.
   ALDH+CD44+ generated more orospheres than control cells when cultured in
   suspension. The growth factor milieu secreted by endothelial cells
   protected HNCSC against anoikis. Mechanistic studies revealed that
   endothelial cell-secreted vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
   induces proliferation of HNCSC derived from primary UM-SCC-22A, but not
   from the metastatic UM-SCC-22B. Likewise, blockade of VEGF abrogated
   endothelial cell-induced Akt phosphorylation in HNCSC derived from
   UM-SCC-22A while it had a modest effect in Akt phosphorylation in HNCSC
   from UM-SCC-22B. This study revealed that endothelial cells initiate a
   crosstalk that protect head and neck cancer stem cells against anoikis,
   and suggest that therapeutic interference with this crosstalk might be
   beneficial for patients with head and neck cancer. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {{Partnering with Engineers to Identify and Empirically Evaluate Delays in
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Laying the Foundations for Quality
   Improvement and System-based Practice in Radiology}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{109-115}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   feasibility of partnering with engineering students and critically
   examining the merit of the problem identification and analyses students
   generated in identifying sources impeding effective turnaround in a
   large university department of diagnostic radiology. Turnaround involves
   the time and activities beginning when a patient enters the magnetic
   resonance scanner room until the patient leaves, minus the time the
   scanner is conducting the protocol.
   Materials and Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted,
   in which four senior undergraduate industrial and operations engineering
   students interviewed magnetic resonance staff members and observed all
   shifts. On the basis of 150 hours of observation, the engineering
   students identified 11 process steps (eg, changing coils). They charted
   machine use for all shifts, providing a breakdown of turnaround time
   between appropriate process and non-value-added time. To evaluate the
   processes occurring in the scanning room, the students used a
   work-sampling schedule in which a beeper sounded 2.5 times per hour,
   signaling the technologist to identify which of 11 process steps was
   occurring. This generated 2147 random observations over a 3-week period.
   Results: The breakdown of machine use over 105 individual studies showed
   that non-value-added time accounted for 62\% of turnaround time.
   Analysis of 2147 random samples of work showed that scanners were empty
   and waiting for patients 15\% of the total time. Analyses showed that
   poor communication delayed the arrival of patients and that no one had
   responsibility for communicating when scanning was done.
   Conclusions: Engineering students used rigorous study design and
   sampling methods to conduct interviews and observations. This led to
   data-driven definition of problems and potential solutions to guide
   systems-based improvement.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Due to the immense phase space of potential alloy catalysts, any
   rigorous screening for optimal alloys requires simple and accurate
   predictive structure reactivity relationships. Herein, we have developed
   a model that allows us to accurately predict variations in adsorption
   energy on alloy surfaces based on easily accessible physical
   characteristics of the metal elements that form the alloy mainly their
   electro-negativity, atomic radius, and the spatial extent of valence
   orbitals. We have developed a scheme relating the geometric structure
   and local chemical environment of active Pt sites to the local chemical
   reactivity of the sites in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR). The accuracy of the model was verified with density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations. The model allows us to screen through large
   libraries of Pt alloys and identify many potentially promising ORR alloy
   catalysts. Some of these materials have previously been tested
   experimentally and shown improved performance compared to pure Pt. Since
   the model is grounded on validated theories of chemisorption on metal
   surfaces, it can be used to identify the critical physical features that
   characterize an optimal alloy electrocatalyst for ORR and propose how
   these features can be engineered.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we have developed mineral coatings on polycaprolactone
   scaffolds to serve as templates for growth factor binding and release.
   Mineral coatings were formed using a biomimetic approach that consisted
   in the incubation of scaffolds in modified simulated body fluids (mSBF).
   To modulate the properties of the mineral coating, which we hypothesized
   would dictate growth factor release, we used carbonate (HCO(3))
   concentration in mSBF of 4.2 mM, 25 mM, and 100 mM. Analysis of the
   mineral coatings formed using scanning electron microscopy indicated
   growth of a continuous layer of mineral with different morphologies.
   X-ray diffraction analysis showed peaks associated with hydroxyapatite,
   the major inorganic constituent of human bone tissue in coatings formed
   in all HCO(3) concentrations. Mineral coatings with increased HCO(3)
   substitution showed more rapid dissolution kinetics in an environment
   deficient in calcium and phosphate but showed re-precipitation in an
   environment with the aforementioned ions. The mineral coating provided
   an effective mechanism for growth factor binding and release. Peptide
   versions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone
   morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) were bound with efficiencies up to 90\%
   to mineral mineral-coated PCL scaffolds. We also demonstrated sustained
   release of all growth factors with release kinetics that were strongly
   dependent in the solubility of the mineral coating. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the safety control problem for hidden mode
   hybrid systems (HMHSs), which are a special class of hybrid automata in
   which the mode is not available for control. For these systems, safety
   control is a problem with imperfect state information. We tackle this
   problem by introducing the notion of nondeterministic discrete
   information state and by translating the problem to one with perfect
   state information. The perfect state information control problem is
   obtained by constructing a new hybrid automaton, whose discrete state is
   an estimate of the HMHS mode and is, as such, available for control.
   This problem is solved by computing the capture set and the least
   restrictive control map for the new hybrid automaton. Sufficient
   conditions for the termination of the algorithm that computes the
   capture set are provided. Finally, we show that the solved perfect state
   information control problem is equivalent to the original problem with
   imperfect state information under suitable assumptions. We illustrate
   the application of the proposed technique to a collision avoidance
   problem between an autonomous vehicle and a human driven vehicle at a
   traffic intersection.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel thermal management system (TMS) is developed for
   the minimization of thermal spread created by a monopolar
   electrosurgical device, the most commonly used surgical instrument. The
   phenomenon of resistive heating of tissue is modeled using the
   finite-element method (FEM) to analyze the electrical potential and
   temperature distributions in biological tissue subjected to heat
   generation during monopolar electrosurgery. Ex vivo experiments are used
   to validate the FEM by comparing the model predicted and experimentally
   measured temperatures. The predicted FEM maximum temperature 1.0mm
   adjacent to the electrode is within 1\% of the experimentally measured
   maximum temperature using a standard monopolar pencil electrode. A TMS
   consisting of adjacent cooling channels produces coagulation volumes
   80\% that of standard monopolar procedures while maintaining comparable
   temperatures in the targeted tissue below the electrode. In vivo
   temperatures using a device incorporating a TMS at distances of 2 and
   3mm adjacent to the electrode edge are maintained below temperatures
   known to damage tissue.}},

   is produced by a novel look-ahead legalization algorithm. Our placer
   SimPL outperforms mPL6, FastPlace3, NTUPlace3, APlace2, and Capo
   simultaneously in runtime and solution quality, running 7.10 times
   faster than mPL6 (when using a single thread) and reducing wirelength by
   3\% on the ISPD 2005 benchmark suite. More significant improvements are
   achieved on larger benchmarks. The new algorithm is amenable to

Abstract = {{In applications such as active learning and disease/fault diagnosis, one
   often encounters the problem of identifying an unknown object through a
   minimal number of queries. This problem has been referred to as query
   learning or object/entity identification. We consider three extensions
   of this fundamental problem that are motivated by practical
   considerations in real-world, time-critical identification tasks such as
   emergency response. First, we consider the problem where the objects are
   partitioned into groups, and the goal is to identify only the group to
   which the object belongs. Second, we address the situation where the
   queries are partitioned into groups, and an algorithm may suggest a
   group of queries to a human user, who then selects the actual query.
   Third, we consider the problem of object identification in the presence
   of persistent query noise, and relate it to group identification. To
   address these problems we show that a standard algorithm for object
   identification, known as generalized binary search, may be viewed as a
   generalization of Shannon-Fano coding. We then extend this result to the
   group-based settings, leading to new algorithms, whose performance is
   demonstrated through a logarithmic approximation bound, and through
   experiments on simulated data and a database used for toxic chemical
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{We consider distributed estimation of the inverse covariance matrix in
   Gaussian graphical models. These models factorize the multivariate
   distribution and allow for efficient distributed signal processing
   methods such as belief propagation (BP). The classical maximum
   likelihood approach to this covariance estimation problem, or potential
   function estimation in BP terminology, requires centralized computing
   and is computationally intensive. This motivates suboptimal distributed
   alternatives that tradeoff accuracy for communication cost. A natural
   solution is for each node to perform estimation of its local covariance
   with respect to its neighbors. The local maximum likelihood estimator is
   asymptotically consistent but suboptimal, i.e., it does not minimize
   mean squared estimation (MSE) error. We propose to improve the MSE
   performance by introducing additional symmetry constraints using
   averaging and pseudolikelihood estimation approaches. We compute the
   proposed estimates using message passing protocols, which can be
   efficiently implemented in large scale graphical models with many nodes.
   We illustrate the advantages of our proposed methods using numerical
   experiments with synthetic data as well as real world data from a
   wireless sensor network.}},

Abstract = {{The arcus tendineus fascia pelvis (ATFP) and arcus tendineus levator ani
   (ATLA) are elements of anterior vaginal support. This study describes
   their geometry in women with unilateral levator ani muscle defects and
   associated ``architectural distortion.{''}
   Fourteen subjects with unilateral defects underwent MRI. 3D models of
   the arcus were generated. The locations of these relative to an ilial
   reference line were compared between the unaffected and affected sides.
   Pronounced changes occurred on the defect sides' ventral region. The
   furthest point of the ATLA lays up to a mean of 10 mm (p = 0.01) more
   inferior and 6.5 mm (p = 0.02) more medial than that on the intact side.
   Similarly, the ATFP lays 6 mm (p = 0.01) more inferior than on the
   unaffected side.
   The ventral arcus anatomy is significantly altered in the presence of
   levator defects and architectural distortion. Alterations of these key
   fixation points will change the supportive force direction along the
   lateral anterior vaginal wall, increasing the risk for anterior vaginal
   wall prolapse.}},

   photolithography. Our photolithographic PDMS surface micromachining
   technique is compatible with conventional soft lithography techniques

   generator systems with thin-film batteries}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{The harvesting of ambient energy to power small electronic components
   has received tremendous attention over the last decade. The research
   goal in this field is to enable self-powered electronic components for
   use particularly in wireless sensing and measurement applications.
   Thermal energy due to temperature gradients, solar energy and ambient
   vibrations constitute some of the major sources of energy that can be
   harvested. Researchers have presented several papers focusing on each of
   these topics separately. This paper aims to develop a hybrid power
   generator and storage system using these three sources of energy in
   order to improve both structural multifunctionality and system-level
   robustness in energy harvesting. A multilayer structure with flexible
   solar, piezoceramic, thin-film battery and metallic substructure layers
   is developed (with the overhang dimensions of 93 mm x 25 mm x 1.5 mm in
   cantilevered configuration). Thermal energy is also used for charging
   the thin-film battery layers using a 30.5 mm x 33 mm x 4.1 mm generator.
   Performance results are presented for charging and discharging of the
   thin-film battery layers using each one of the harvesting methods. It is
   shown based on the extrapolation of a set of measurements that 1 mA h of
   a thin-film battery can be charged in 20 min using solar energy (for a
   solar irradiance level of 223 W m(-2)), in 40 min using thermal energy
   (for a temperature difference of 31 degrees C) and in 8 h using
   vibrational energy (for a harmonic base acceleration input of 0.5g at
   56.4 Hz).}},

Title = {{Novel needle cutting edge geometry for end-cut biopsy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{99-108}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To introduce and determine the biopsy length performance of the
   novel enhanced cutting edge (ECE) needle tip design, which contains high
   inclination angles that allow for more efficient tissue cutting.
   Methods: ECE and regular two-plane symmetric needle tip's biopsy
   performance and cutting force are compared over a series of needle
   insertion experiments into bovine liver under varying levels of internal
   needle vacuum. An earlier developed needle tip force model is also
   applied. From these experiments and force model, the effect of needle
   tip geometry and vacuum on biopsy performance and force is studied.
   Results: Biopsy sample length is on average 22\%, 30\%, and 49\% longer
   for ECE needles compared to that of regular needles for the internal
   pressures of 0, -33.9, and -67.7 kPa, respectively. For ECE needles the
   vacuum level of -67.7 kPa produces on average biopsy lengths that are
   41\%, 31\%, 29\%, 45\%, and 42\% longer compared to no vacuum for
   two-plane needle tip bevel angles of 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees,
   25 degrees, and 30 degrees, respectively. The force results show the ECE
   needle can be inserted with less initial insertion force than the
   regular two-plane needle for needles where the needle tip is fully
   contacting the tissue upon insertion. Vacuum is also showed to help
   lower insertion forces.
   Conclusions: The novel ECE needle tip design outperforms the regular
   two-plane symmetric needle by yielding longer biopsy samples and lower
   insertion forces, thereby demonstrating the benefits of needle
   geometries that contain higher inclination angles. The use of vacuum
   further improves the ECE needle tip biopsy sample length and lowers
   insertion forces. VC 2012 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{Fluid flow within the dendritic structure at the solid-liquid interface
   in nickel-based superalloys has been studied in two directionally

   datasets of dendritic structure have been collected by serial
   sectioning, and the reconstructed mushy zones have been used as domains
   for fluid-flow modeling. Flow permeability and the influence of
   dendritic structure on flow patterns have been investigated.
   Permeability analyses indicate that the cross flow normal to the
   withdrawal direction limits the development of flow instabilities. Local
   Rayleigh numbers calculated using the permeabilities extracted from the
   3D dataset are higher than predicted by conventional empirical
   calculations in the regions of the mushy zone that are prone to the
   onset of convective instabilities. The ability to measure dendrite
   surface area in 3D volumes permit improved prediction of permeability as
   well.}},

Pages = {{639-644}},
Abstract = {{Graphene is considered as a promising candidate to replace conventional
   transparent conductors due to its low opacity, high carrier mobility and
   flexible structure. Multi-layer graphene or stacked single layer
   graphenes have been investigated in the past but both have their
   drawbacks. The uniformity of multi-layer graphene is still questionable,
   and single layer graphene stacks require many transfer processes to
   achieve sufficiently low sheet resistance. In this work, bilayer
   graphene film grown with low pressure chemical vapor deposition was used
   as a transparent conductor for the first time. The technique was
   demonstrated to be highly efficient in fabricating a conductive and
   uniform transparent conductor compared to multi-layer or single layer
   graphene. Four transfers of bilayer graphene yielded a transparent
   conducting film with a sheet resistance of 180 Omega(rectangle) at a
   transmittance of 83\%. In addition, bilayer graphene films transferred
   onto the plastic substrate showed remarkable robustness against bending,
   with sheet resistance change less than 15\% at 2.14\% strain, a 20-fold
   improvement over commercial indium oxide films.}},

Abstract = {{The authors have demonstrated that histotripsy (pulsed cavitational
   ultrasound) can create atrial septal defects and ventricular septal
   defects (VSDs) in an open-chest canine model transcutaneously through
   the intact chest of neonatal pigs. To assess the potential untoward
   effects of these applications, the clinical, systemic, and pathologic
   effects of histotripsy-induced intracardiac communications were
   analyzed. Six neonatal pigs received noninvasive ultrasound therapy to
   their ventricular septa, then were allowed to survive 1 month for
   evaluation of intermediate-term effects. The results were compared with
   those of six previous animals killed immediately and three others killed
   2-3 days after the procedure. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
   an assessment of cardiac function were performed with long-term
   survivors, and pathologic specimens were obtained when the animals were
   killed. In all 15 animals, VSDs 2-6.5 mm wide were successfully created.
   No fatalities occurred, and all the animals thrived, achieving normal
   weight gain by the time they were killed. Brain MRI and lung pathology
   exhibited no evidence of thromboembolic events. No damage to intervening
   tissue was observed. Pathologic analysis showed demarcated damage to the
   ventricular septa. Flanking injury and hemorrhage observed acutely were
   resolved by 1 month, with tissue remodeling present. Transcutaneous
   histotripsy is a safe and effective technique for creating intracardiac
   communications noninvasively without intermediate-term untoward effects.
   With further refinement and development, histotripsy has the potential
   to become an effective tool for palliation of congenital heart disease.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical system (CPS) research aims to integrate physical and
   computational models in a manner that outperforms a system in which the
   two models are kept separate. CPSs can be generated by either folding
   properties of the physics-based system into a discrete modeling paradigm
   or vice versa. This paper studies the latter by abstracting execution
   rate of a real-time feedback control task into a continuous state-space
   form traditionally employed for physics-based systems. We propose
   coupling the two models in a linear systems framework and study the
   impact of this coupling applied to a single degree of freedom
   second-order oscillator as well as an unstable inverted pendulum, both
   regulated with an appropriately designed linear quadratic regulator
   (LQR). Our results illustrate the utility of the proposed abstraction
   and controller design as a means of coregulating cyber and physical

Abstract = {{Body sensor networks (BSNs) are emerging cyber-physical systems that
   promise to improve quality of life through improved healthcare,
   augmented sensing and actuation for the disabled, independent living for
   the elderly, and reduced healthcare costs. However, the physical nature
   of BSNs introduces new challenges. The human body is a highly dynamic
   physical environment that creates constantly changing demands on
   sensing, actuation, and quality of service (QoS). Movement between
   indoor and outdoor environments and physical movements constantly change
   the wireless channel characteristics. These dynamic application contexts
   can also have a dramatic impact on data and resource prioritization.
   Thus, BSNs must simultaneously deal with rapid changes to both top-down
   application requirements and bottom-up resource availability. This is
   made all the more challenging by the wearable nature of BSN devices,
   which necessitates a vanishingly small size and, therefore, extremely
   limited hardware resources and power budget. Current research is being
   per-formed to develop new principles and techniques for adaptive
   operation in highly dynamic physical environments, using miniaturized,
   energy-constrained devices. This paper describes a holistic cross-layer
   approach that addresses all aspects of the system, from low-level
   hardware design to higher level communication and data fusion
   algorithms, to top-level applications.}},

   structural control using a synchronized switch damping method}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Modal coupling is an important issue in the analysis and control of
   structural systems with multi-degrees of freedom (MDOF). In this paper,
   modal coupling induced by energy conversion in the structural control of
   an MDOF system using a synchronized switch damping method is
   investigated theoretically and validated numerically. In the analysis,
   it is supposed that the voltage on the piezoelectric actuator is
   switched at the displacement extrema of a given mode. Two types of
   coupling in energy conversion are considered. The first is whether the
   switching action based on one mode induces energy conversion of the
   other modes. The second is whether the vibration of one mode affects the
   energy conversion of the other modes. The results indicate that the
   modal coupling in energy conversion is very complicated. In most cases
   the switching action based on one mode does induce energy conversion of
   another mode, but the efficiency depends on the frequency ratio of the
   two modes. The vibration of one mode affects the energy conversion of
   another mode only when the frequency ratio of the two modes takes some
   special values. Discussions are also given on the potential application
   of the theoretical results in the design of an energy harvesting device.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of designing a large-scale structure with many variables
   can often be increased by decomposing the design problem into less
   complex sub-problems. This article presents heuristic procedures of
   determining an appropriate design sequence to solve decomposed
   structural optimization problems using a sequential design (single-pass)
   strategy. One heuristic procedure exploits the monotonicity of a global
   constraint, which is included in all the sub-problems. Another procedure
   is based on the coupling strength of interactions between sub-problems,
   obtaining the appropriate design sequence and then verifying it with
   monotonicity analysis. The procedures are applied to two types of
   structural design problems; the metric for sequencing decomposed
   sub-problems can be obtained analytically for one design problem and
   numerically for another one. As a result, the sequencing procedures lead
   to satisfactory solutions at low computational cost, indicating their
   value for industrial product development.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the performance of probability estimation
   methods for reliability analysis. The probability estimation methods
   typically construct the probability density function (PDF) of a system
   response using estimated statistical moments, and then perform
   reliability analysis based on the approximate PDF. In recent years, a
   number of probability estimation methods have been proposed, such as the
   Pearson system, saddlepoint approximation, Maximum Entropy Principle
   (MEP), and Johnson system. However, no general guideline to suggest a
   most appropriate probability estimation method has yet been proposed. In
   this study, we carry out a comparative study of the four probability
   estimation methods so as to derive the general guidelines. Several
   comparison metrics are proposed to quantify the accuracy in the PDF
   approximation, cumulative density function (CDF) approximation and tail
   probability estimations (or reliability analysis). This comparative
   study gives an insightful guidance for selecting the most appropriate
   probability estimation method for reliability analysis. The four
   probability estimation methods are extensively tested with one
   mathematical and two engineering examples, each of which considers eight
   different combinations of the system response characteristics in terms
   of response boundness, skewness, and kurtosis.}},

Abstract = {{We present pyOpt, an object-oriented framework for formulating and
   solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems in an efficient,
   reusable and portable manner. The framework uses object-oriented
   concepts, such as class inheritance and operator overloading, to
   maintain a distinct separation between the problem formulation and the
   optimization approach used to solve the problem. This creates a common
   interface in a flexible environment where both practitioners and
   developers alike can solve their optimization problems or develop and
   benchmark their own optimization algorithms. The framework is developed
   in the Python programming language, which allows for easy integration of
   optimization software programmed in Fortran, C, C+ +, and other
   languages. A variety of optimization algorithms are integrated in pyOpt
   and are accessible through the common interface. We solve a number of
   problems of increasing complexity to demonstrate how a given problem is
   formulated using this framework, and how the framework can be used to
   benchmark the various optimization algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a homogenization-based theory for three-dimensional
   anisotropic beams. The proposed beam theory uses a hierarchy of
   solutions to carefully-chosen beam problems that are referred to as the
   fundamental states. The stress and strain distribution in the beam is
   expressed as a linear combination of the fundamental state solutions and
   stress and strain residuals that capture the parts of the solution not
   accounted for by the fundamental states. This decomposition plays an
   important role in the homogenization process and provides a consistent
   method to reconstruct the stress and strain distribution in the beam in
   a post-processing calculation. A finite-element method is presented to
   calculate the fundamental state solutions. Results are presented
   demonstrating that the stress and strain reconstruction achieves
   accuracy comparable with full three-dimensional finite element
   computations, away from the ends of the beam. The computational cost of
   the proposed approach is three orders of magnitude less than the
   computational cost of full three-dimensional calculations for the cases
   presented here. For isotropic beams with symmetric cross-sections, the
   proposed theory takes the form of classical Timoshenko beam theory with
   Cowper's shear correction factor and additional load-dependent
   corrections. The proposed approach provides an extension of Timoshenko's
   beam theory that handles sections with anisotropic construction. (C)

Abstract = {{Model predictive control (MPC) methods have a well-earned reputation for
   providing on-line solutions to optimal feedback control problems,
   particularly for systems with control and parameter constraints.
   Previous work has shown the value of MPC in designing non-disruptive
   load-shedding strategies for power systems. The nonlinear, non-smooth
   dynamics of power systems make direct application of MPC difficult
   though. Therefore previous load-shedding applications of MPC have made
   use of an approximate discrete-time linear dynamic model that describes
   perturbations to the system's nominal behavior over a finite-time
   horizon. This approximate model is based on trajectory sensitivities.
   The article pursues several enhancements of such MPC-based load-shedding
   strategies. Specifically, at each MPC stage, we propose using a two-step
   optimization process to determine the optimal input sequence. This helps
   in combating the possibility of growing error in the discrete-time
   approximation if large input modifications are needed. We also consider
   the effects of varying voltage constraints over the MPC optimization
   horizon. The new two-step MPC strategies are used to design
   load-shedding controls that prevent voltage collapse in a ten-bus
   benchmark-system example.}},

   delay since transmitting a packet directly to the receiver may consume
   more energy than transmitting through a relay whereas transmission
   through relay incurs more delay. We consider two cases; when nodes are
   cooperative and when nodes are strategic. We show that when nodes are
   strategic, there exist payment transfer functions to be exchanged
   between the nodes such that the socially optimal Markov policy is the
   unique sub game perfect equilibrium of the resulting dynamic game.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the distributed source coding problem with a
   joint distortion criterion. We use random structured codes, specifically
   nested Abelian group codes to achieve a new inner bound to the
   rate-distortion region. This new inner bound unifies all other known
   results on the distributed source coding problem and for certain
   sources, this inner bound is strictly larger than other known rate
   regions. Furthermore, we define the notion of ``nested random/group
   codes{''} in which the inner code is a group code and the outer code is
   a random code such that the quantization operation is a random vector
   quantization and the binning operation is correlated. We use
   random/group codes to improve upon the rate region achieved using nested
   group codes. We define two fundamental quantities of Abelian group
   codes: the ``channel coding group entropy{''} and the ``source coding
   group entropy{''} to present the achievable rate region.}},

Abstract = {{Design Heuristics is an empirically driven design ideation tool intended
   to support variation and novelty in concept generation. The set of
   heuristics was extracted from observations of professional and novice
   designers at work, and by analyses of a large set of award-winning
   products. Through the observations of designers at work, we realized
   that the subconscious use of heuristics could manifest as either a
   modification of an existing concept or as the development of a new idea
   seemingly from scratch. Acknowledging this, we sought to understand how
   Design Heuristics are best taught to novice designers. In this study, we
   conducted separate instructional sessions on Design Heuristic use,
   teaching them as a concept generation technique and as a concept
   transformation technique. Our results show that both approaches yielded
   design improvements, though the variation between concepts tends to be
   larger when using a generative approach. Also, Design Heuristics in both
   approaches helped students elaborate their concepts, generate new ideas,
   and encouraged them to push forward with previous ideas. These findings
   contribute to our knowledge about how to best teach Design Heuristics in
   the classroom.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering students begin their education with varying understanding of
   the engineering design process. Effective engineering education will
   require us to understand how students develop both skills and a concept
   of engineering design. At a large Midwestern public university we
   compare 100 students' initial conceptions in design and response to
   design tasks both before and after a 2-day, peer mentor led, design
   activity program which preceded the beginning of the first year in
   engineering. During the program, students were led through two design
   activities: one focusing on idea generation and customer requirements;
   the second focusing on a design, build and test activity. In addition,
   there were faculty presentations and discussions led by peer mentors. We
   also compare 35 incoming students who did not participate in the
   program. This program is the initial activity in an undergraduate
   multidisciplinary design program which includes many co-curricular
   enrichment activities as well as an academic minor. We intend to study
   this group of students through their engineering education and evaluate
   them periodically. We use both the self-efficacy survey from Carberry,
   Lee and Ohland (Measuring Engineering Design Self-Efficacy) as well as
   the concepts in design survey from Oehlberg and Agogino (Undergraduate

   al., Conceptions of the Engineering Design Process: An Expert Study of
   Advanced Practicing Professionals) extending them to the incoming
   university student population.
   We consider how students' concept of design changes pre and post program
   and compare them with the results of upperclassmen from Oehlberg and
   Agogino and with practicing engineers in Mosborg. Generally students
   undervalued concepts related to generating alternative ideas as well as
   identifying hard constraints of the system compared with practicing
   engineers. The post program responses showed limited change from
   pre-program responses. Program students most closely resemble the
   Intermediate group (engineering students) of Carberry, Lee and Ohland in
   terms of self-efficacy and the High group (engineering professors and
   professionals) for motivation, expectancy and anxiety.
   We plan to follow this group of students through their first year of
   engineering and re-evaluate near the end of the academic year.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to compare and evaluate the learning styles of
   students in Bangladesh and the United States. The objective was to
   identify the similarities and differences among student learning styles
   using the Fielder-Silverman model and an index of learning styles, which
   was compiled using student response data from two universities in
   Bangladesh and one American university. Statistical analysis was
   performed to identify the factors affecting learning style, such as the
   number of years spent in school, cultural background, and academic
   major. Altogether, eight dimensions were used to study the students'
   learning preferences. The analysis concluded there was no difference
   between the learning styles of American and Bangladeshi engineering
   students. However, the results discovered a difference between first
   year (freshmen) and final year (senior) engineering students on the
   sensing/intuitive dimension. Differences in learning style were also
   observed between students from different academic majors on the
   sensing/intuitive and visual/verbal dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{There have been ongoing initiatives by all stakeholders of the higher
   education system of Bangladesh to improve the quality of education by
   developing a unified standard among all higher education institutions.
   To date, these efforts and initiatives have been largely unsuccessful
   due to a lack of understanding of the current state of education
   quality. Unfortunately, the problems are gradually magnifying as new
   private universities are evolving without any infrastructure, government
   regulation, or accreditation bodies. Three years ago, a large project
   financed by the government and the World Bank was initiated to enhance
   quality with a number of sub-projects.
   This paper identifies the root causes of the challenges faced by the
   higher education system as well as explains how these challenges can be
   addressed effectively. A recent visit to Bangladesh as a consultant to
   improve the quality of higher education revealed the higher education
   system requires a major overhaul. Not only is there no pedagogical
   research or training available to faculty but faculty motivation is also
   low. The higher education system employs rote memorization approach
   rather than critical thinking by students. With significant political
   and economic pressure, the current, non-transparent system must be
   changed before any reasonable improvements can be made. Information
   presented in this paper will be valuable for other developing countries
   as well since they may face similar issues in their own higher education
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of racial diversity in undergraduate engineering programs is a
   growing concern in the United States. According to a study released by
   NACME in 2008, only 4\% of underrepresented minorities that are
   graduating from high school have taken the necessary math and science
   classes to even be qualified for admission to such engineering
   programs(1). As a result, considerable efforts have been made to improve
   the pre-college science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
   programs such that minority students have more opportunities for success
   in college engineering programs. This paper focuses on an ongoing study
   that involves an in-depth introduction of civil engineering concepts to
   middle school students from historically underrepresented groups.
   Throughout this three day extracurricular program the students are
   introduced to technical concepts in surveying, structural engineering
   and solid mechanics. Though each session focuses on a different
   component of civil engineering, the main academic focal point of the
   program is to introduce students to basic concepts of trigonometry
   through application to interesting engineering problems. By doing this,
   the concept will either be reinforced to the student (if they had
   previously learned it in their classes) or give the student a slight
   competitive edge over their peers when they do learn it. Additionally,
   the activities associated with the new concepts are intended to foster
   interest in civil engineering and demonstrate to the student how
   techniques learned in the classroom can be applied to engineering
   problems. The program has currently been implemented for one session and
   the success of the program was assessed through pre-and post-program
   surveys. Overall, the program was deemed successful through increased
   comprehension of trigonometric properties and a general escalation of
   interest in engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Exposing students to Computer Science at an early age is critical to the
   continued growth and development of the Computer Science community. Once
   students are shown the pervasive impact of modern computing, long-term
   interest in Computer Science can continue to be stimulated through
   curriculums built around popular, age-specific topics. The advent of
   mobile computing through virtually every age group makes mobile
   application design and development an attractive topic for future K-12
   Computer Science curriculums. The first part of this work details our
   experiences using an Android-based development platform to teach basic
   Computer Science principles. The second part of this work leverages that
   experience to propose a range of Introductory Computer Science
   curriculums targeted at the 9th through 12th grade age groups. Using a
   variety of user-experience surveys, we have found that combining mobile
   application development with introductory Computer Science concepts nets
   a great deal of positive feedback from students. As such, we provide a
   framework for extending this type of curriculum for future educators.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of the computing field is becoming more profound everyday in
   all facets of modern society. Despite significant efforts from academia
   and relatively high demand for computing, technology producers are
   needed more than ever. This has been corroborated by a recent NSF Press
   Release In stating that computing is the only STEM discipline with more
   job openings than college graduates to fill them up. A major
   responsibility for such an outcome rests upon educators' ability to
   produce professionals capable of handling ever more complex technical
   challenges.
   In this challenging environment, the importance of practical work in
   science and engineering, supported by lab exercises, is widely known.
   While it is desirable to create physical laboratories for teaching these
   technologies, it is not always possible nor desirable. In this paper, we
   present an effective alternative approach, in the form of an affordable,
   virtualized laboratory environment that can be used in a variety of
   computing and engineering courses, as well as in other fields, in lieu
   of physical labs.
   Results of a survey supporting the validity of this approach are also
   presented. Students in four different classes were surveyed concerning
   the effectiveness and desirability of this virtual laboratory approach.
   The survey results indicate that student response to and interest in the
   virtual environment is very strong.}},

Abstract = {{Battery systems for electric vehicles (EVs) or uninterruptible
   micro-grids-prototypical cyber-physical systems (CPSs)-are usually built
   with several hundreds/thousands of battery cells. How to deal with the
   inevitable failure of cells quickly and cost-effectively for vehicle
   warranty or uninterruptible service, for instance, is key to the
   development of large-scale battery systems. Use of extra (redundant/
   backup) cells to cope with cell failures must be minimized so as to make
   the target systems cheaper and lighter, while meeting the reliability
   requirement that is directly related to, for example, the vehicle
   warranty. Existing reconfigurable battery systems do not scale well
   because they incur a long delay in properly setting a large number of
   switches to bypass faulty cells or adapting to dynamically changing
   power demands in large battery systems for such applications as EVs.
   In this paper, we propose a scalable solution, not only to reduce the
   required number of backup cells and the total cost of a battery system,
   but also to facilitate recovery from cell failures and adapt to changing
   power demands while increasing battery utilization. Specifically, we
   optimize the pack-size by striking a balance between various types of
   cost in order to reduce the overall cost. We also configure battery
   packs and optimize their connection topology, reducing delays in failure
   recovery and power reallocation. Our in-depth evaluation has shown that
   the time to recover from cell failures remains constant irrespective of
   the number of cells involved, which is important to scalability. The
   proposed pack-sizing also reduces the cost and the size of battery
   systems. Moreover, fast power reallocation is achieved by utilizing
   prior knowledge of power usage patterns.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a method for wirelessly measuring analog voltage
   on DUTs. This technique can be used for test structure characterization.
   The proposed voltage-to-time converter enables analog voltage values to
   be wirelessly delivered through capacitive coupling. A dual-slope
   architecture is adopted to mitigate the effects of on-chip R and C
   variation, and an UWB pulse generator is used to relay accurate timing
   to the ATE with low-power consumption. A prototype, fabricated in 0.13
   mu m CMOS achieves 8-bit resolution with 1 mV measurement steps. The
   total area of the on-chip wireless voltage measurement circuit is 0.013
   mm(2) excluding wireless pads.}},

Abstract = {{Surfaces that display contact angles greater than 1500 along with a low
   contact angle hysteresis for low surface tension liquids such as oils
   and alcohols are known as superoleophobic surfaces. Such surfaces are of
   interest for a diverse array of applications including self-cleaning,
   stain-free clothing and drag reduction. Recently, significant advances
   have been made in understanding the criteria required to design
   superoleophobic surfaces. In this chapter, we will discuss two
   dimensionless design parameters that can be used for the rational design
   of superoleophobic surfaces. We will also summarize the recent studies
   on superoleophobic surfaces and emphasize the need for careful and
   diligent characterization. Finally, we will conclude with the major
   challenges and opportunities for research on superoleophobic surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Moving object segmentation from an image sequence is essential for a
   robot to interact with its environment. Traditional vision approaches
   appeal to pure motion analysis on videos without exploiting the source
   of the background motion. We observe, however, that the background
   motion (from the robot's egocentric view) has stronger correlation to
   the robot's motor signals than the foreground motion. We propose a novel
   approach to detecting moving objects by clustering features into
   background and foreground according to their motion consistency with
   motor signals. Specifically, our approach learns homography and
   fundamental matrices as functions of motor signals, and predict sparse
   feature locations from the learned matrices. The errors between the
   predictions and their actual tracked locations are used to label them
   into background and foreground. The labels of the sparse features are
   then propagated to all pixels. Our approach does not require building a
   dense mosaic background or searching for affine, homography, or
   fundamental matrix parameters for foreground separation. In addition, it
   does not need to explicitly model the intrinsic and extrinsic
   calibration parameters hence requires much less prior geometry
   knowledge. It works completely in 2D image space, and does not involve
   any complex analysis or computation in 3D space.}},

   two-class auditory streaming brain-computer interface}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Abstract = {{Most brain-computer interface (BCI) systems require users to modulate
   brain signals in response to visual stimuli. Thus, they may not be
   useful to people with limited vision, such as those with severe
   paralysis. One important approach for overcoming this issue is auditory
   streaming, an approach whereby a BCI system is driven by shifts of
   attention between two simultaneously presented auditory stimulus
   streams. Motivated by the long-term goal of translating such a system
   into a reliable, simple yes-no interface for clinical usage, we aim to
   answer two main questions. First, we asked which of two previously
   published variants provides superior performance: a fixed-phase (FP)
   design in which the streams have equal period and opposite phase, or a
   drifting-phase (DP) design where the periods are unequal. We found FP to
   be superior to DP (p = 0.002): average performance levels were 80 and
   72\% correct, respectively. We were also able to show, in a pilot with
   one subject, that auditory streaming can support continuous control and
   neurofeedback applications: by shifting attention between ongoing left
   and right auditory streams, the subject was able to control the position
   of a paddle in a computer game. Second, we examined whether the system
   is dependent on eye movements, since it is known that eye movements and
   auditory attention may influence each other, and any dependence on the
   ability to move one's eyes would be a barrier to translation to
   paralyzed users. We discovered that, despite instructions, some subjects
   did make eye movements that were indicative of the direction of
   attention. However, there was no correlation, across subjects, between
   the reliability of the eye movement signal and the reliability of the
   BCI system, indicating that our system was configured to work
   independently of eye movement. Together, these findings are an
   encouraging step forward toward BCIs that provide practical
   communication and control options for the most severely paralyzed users.}},

Title = {{NF-kappa B signaling dynamics play a key role in infection control in
   tuberculosis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The NF-kappa B signaling pathway is central to the body's response to
   many pathogens. Mathematical models based on cell culture experiments
   have identified important molecular mechanisms controlling the dynamics
   of NF-kappa B signaling, but the dynamics of this pathway have never
   been studied in the context of an infection in a host. Here, we
   incorporate these dynamics into a virtual infection setting. We build a
   multi-scale model of the immune response to the pathogen Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis (Mtb) to explore the impact of NF-kappa B dynamics
   occurring across molecular, cellular, and tissue scales in the lung.
   NF-kappa B signaling is triggered via tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)
   binding to receptors on macrophages; TNF has been shown to play a key
   role in infection dynamics in humans and multiple animal systems. Using
   our multi-scale model, we predict the impact of TNF-induced NF-kappa
   B-mediated responses on the outcome of infection at the level of a
   granuloma, an aggregate of immune cells and bacteria that forms in
   response to infection and is key to containment of infection and
   clinical latency. We show how the stability of mRNA transcripts
   corresponding to NF-kappa B-mediated responses significantly controls
   bacterial load in a granuloma, inflammation level in tissue, and
   granuloma size. Because we incorporate intracellular signaling pathways
   explicitly, our analysis also elucidates NF-kappa B-associated signaling
   molecules and processes that may be new targets for infection control.}},

Title = {{Very Low-Cost In-Process Gauging System}},
Booktitle = {{MACHINE VISION HANDBOOK, VOLS 1-3}},
Year = {{2012}},
Pages = {{1137-1146}},
Abstract = {{A vision system for gauging two types of automotive parts is described
   in this article. One of the part types is a power steering connector, in
   which the depth and width of the groove, and the distance between the
   start of the groove and the end of the power steering line are gauged.
   For the second type of part, a crimped connector attached to a brake
   hose, measurements of interest are the two diameters of the crimp and
   the bell length, where the hose is inserted into the connector. A
   standard video camera is used to acquire the image of a back-illuminated
   part which is digitized and captured with a frame grabber. The basic
   hardware to accomplish the gauging tasks consists of a standard video
   camera, light source, frame grabber and industrial personal computer. In
   order to minimise hardware costs, a standard 50 mm C-mount camera lens
   and extension tube was used with the video camera. Consideration had
   been made to use more expensive telecentric optics so that parts
   placement would not cause a change in magnification with a resulting
   loss of accuracy. With the 50 mm lens, however, magnification effects
   were lessened due to the greater standoff distance between camera and
   part. Combined with a modern personal computer, rapid image acquisition
   and analysis provides 100\% inspection at full production rates. Since
   the gauging rate exceeds the production rate by a significant factor, a
   single computer and frame grabber with camera multiplexer can process
   data in real time from up to four measurement stations simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{A common machine vision task is to verify that a product has been
   properly fabricated or assembled. In the following chapter, a vision
   system is described for confirming that a type of gear has been machined
   properly. The main problem in this application is the relatively large
   depth of the gear which results in a more complex image than the desired
   silhouette of the part. The resulting image shows a portion of the inner
   wall due to the varying magnification because some points on this wall
   are closer to the lens than others. Employing telecentric optics,
   however, greatly simplifies the problem since only light rays parallel
   to the optical axis create the image so that a good silhouette of the
   part is obtained. Gear teeth can then be isolated using mathematical
   morphology techniques to verify that the part has been properly
   broached.}},

Booktitle = {{MACHINE VISION HANDBOOK, VOLS 1-3}},
Year = {{2012}},
Pages = {{1165-1174}},
Abstract = {{The Crosshead Inspection System (CIS) utilizes machine vision technology
   for on-line inspection of a crosshead which is a diesel engine
   component. The system includes three functional modules:
   1. Part handling subsystem presents parts for inspection and accepts or
   rejects them based on signals from the image analysis software.
   2. Image acquisition hardware consisting of optics, light sources and
   two video cameras to collect images of inspected parts.
   3. Image analysis software to analyze images and send pass/fail decision
   signals to the handling subsystem.
   The CIS acquires and inspects two images of each part. The upper camera
   generates an image of the part's top surface, while the lower camera
   generates an image of the so-called ``pockets{''} on the part bottom.
   Both images are acquired when a part-in-place signal is received from
   the handling system. The surface inspection camera and light source are
   positioned at opposed low angles relative to the surface. Irregularities
   manifest themselves as dark regions on the surface. These regions are
   detected, measured and compared to user specifications. The pocket
   inspection function detects the presence of tumbler stones in which the
   contrast of these stones is enhanced with circularly polarized lighting
   and imaging. The graphical user interface of the CIS provides easy setup
   and debugging of the image processing algorithms. A database module
   stores and archives part inspection statistics for later evaluation. The
   inspection rate is sixty parts per minute.}},

Abstract = {{A system for the inspection of stemware for geometrical defects and
   glass imperfections is described in this paper in which cameras at three
   stations are used for enhanced defect detection. Internal glass quality,
   contaminants and optical nonuniformity are evaluated at the first
   station. The second station inspects the glass rim and stemware shape
   and detects internal defects such as cracks. The third station inspects
   the stemware base for geometrical and internal defects. Glass
   irregularities are optically enhanced using a striped illumination
   pattern and detected using morphological processing. Geometric
   inspection is enhanced through the use of converging illumination at the
   second station, while the third station utilizes telecentric optics.
   Progressive scan cameras and frame grabbers capable of simultaneous
   image capture are used at each station. The system software comprises
   six modules consisting of the system manager, I/O manager, inspection
   module for each station, and stemware sorting and logging module. Each
   module runs as a separate process. Applications communicate with each
   other through TCP/IP sockets, and can be run in one or more computers.
   Two personal computers are used for the system described here.}},

Title = {{Determination of Geometric Stability of Glass Substrates}},
Booktitle = {{MACHINE VISION HANDBOOK, VOLS 1-3}},
Year = {{2012}},
Pages = {{1243-1249}},
Abstract = {{The stability of glass substrates is an important concern for the flat
   panel display industry. High-resolution displays have very tight
   geometrical requirements and alignment of the various display components
   is critical if good performance is to be obtained. Prior to development
   of manufacturing processes for these displays, it was necessary to
   determine how glass substrates change during the various processing
   steps. This chapter describes a system to measure electrode patterns
   before and after critical processing steps for color plasma panels. The
   electrode patterns, which are made of thin-film gold, form a series of
   parallel electrodes. In order to measure electrode locations, a vision
   system consisting of an X-Y stage, a video camera, a frame grabber, and
   personal computer was used. Images captured with this setup were
   processed to minimize the effects of noise and improve accuracy. A
   gray-scale interpolation technique in which the centroids of the
   electrodes are calculated was used to enhance measurement resolution.}},

Title = {{Glass Thickness Measurement Using Morphology}},
Booktitle = {{MACHINE VISION HANDBOOK, VOLS 1-3}},
Year = {{2012}},
Pages = {{1251-1259}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses simple but effective one-dimensional morphological
   techniques for the identification of primary and secondary peak
   locations associated with light patterns reflected from glass surfaces.
   Acommon optical technique for measuring glass thickness and related
   properties is to observe light reflected from the front and rear
   surfaces of the glass. Two reflections can be observed when an
   appropriate structured light source is used to illuminate the glass: a
   bright primary reflection from the front surface will be observed, along
   with a much fainter secondary reflection from the back. The secondary
   reflection is difficult to detect reliably, due to the large difference
   in intensity compared to the first reflection, the presence of noise,
   and possibly overlap between them. The methods described in the paper
   have been implemented successfully for two separate applications, using
   standard matrix and linear cameras. In both cases, the signal is
   pre-processed using one-dimensional morphological and linear methods, to
   normalize the background and remove noise. Further morphological
   operations are performed, to identify the peaks associated with the
   primary and secondary reflections.}},

   distributed compliant mechanisms}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-23}},
Abstract = {{Synthesizing topologies of compliant mechanisms are based on rigid-link
   kinematic designs or completely automated optimization techniques. These
   designs yield mechanisms that match the kinematic specifications as a
   whole, but seldom yield user insight on how each constituent member
   contributes towards the overall mechanism performance. This paper
   reviews recent developments in building block based design of compliant
   mechanisms. A key aspect of such a methodology is formulating a
   representation of compliance at a (i) single unique point of interest in
   terms of geometric quantities such as ellipses and vectors, and (ii)
   relative compliance between distinct input(s) and output(s) in terms of
   load flow. This geometric representation provides a direct mapping
   between the mechanism geometry and their behavior, and is used to
   characterize simple deformable members that form a library of building
   blocks. The design space spanned by the building block library guides
   the decomposition of a given problem specification into tractable
   sub-problems that can be each solved from an entry in the library. The
   effectiveness of this geometric representation aids user insight in
   design, and enables discovery of trends and guidelines to obtain
   practical conceptual designs.}},

Abstract = {{Microelectromechanical devices provide an attractive means for
   increasing sensing and actuation capabilities during minimally invasive
   medical procedures, where a goal is to limit the effects of disease
   diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment by performing operations through
   natural orifices or with very small incisions. In this chapter, a survey
   of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) applications to minimally
   invasive procedures is performed, exploring proposed uses of
   micromachined mechanisms in primarily short-term tests or interventions.
   A general overview is provided, followed by a discussion of MEMS
   scanning-mirror technology as applicable to microvisualization tools.
   Prominent prototype instruments based on MEMS mirrors include endoscopic
   and laparoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT), dual-axes confocal
   microscopy, and multiphoton microscopy tools. Medical interventions
   based on manipulation of tissue by miniature structures and instruments
   are then described, moving from optical tools for laser-based surgery to
   static biopsy tools to flexible micromachined stents to fully mobile
   microrobots. A summary of accomplishments and needs for MEMS-based
   minimally invasive instruments to transition from laboratory to clinical

Abstract = {{As nanoscale science, engineering, and technology (NSET) becomes more
   integrated into precollege science curricula, it is crucial for teachers
   to develop coherent understandings of science principles (e.g., the
   structure of matter, size and scale, forces and interactions, and
   size-dependent properties) that allow them to coordinate these
   understandings from the macro- to the nanoscale. Furthermore, as
   teachers acquire new NSET content knowledge through professional
   learning opportunities, it is incumbent upon NSET educators to
   understand their developing content knowledge. To this end, we report
   results from a study in which we used a pre-/post-/delayed-posttest
   design to examine the change in 24 secondary (grades 7-12) science
   teachers' NSET content knowledge as a result of their participation in a
   year-long professional development program that consisted of a 2-week
   intensive course and academic year follow-up activities. Participants
   showed significant gains from pretest to posttest and significant gains
   on the delayed test compared to the pretest. We also present trends that
   emerged in teachers' open-ended responses that provided deeper insight
   into teachers' NSET content knowledge. Finally, we discuss issues
   related to the assessment of teachers' NSET content knowledge as well as
   the design of NSET professional development for teachers.}},

Abstract = {{A high resolution ion print head architecture which utilizes
   micro-dielectric barrier discharges (mDBD's) has been developed for
   charging of surfaces in electrophotographic (EP) printing. The mDBDs
   consist of arrays of micro-plasma devices (10-100 mu m diameter)
   fabricated using MEMS techniques. A radio frequency (rf) voltage
   waveform biases an electrode which is buried in a dielectric substrate.
   A third biasing electrode separated by hundreds of microns from the
   dielectric surface is used to extract electron charges. To aid in the
   development and improve the performance of ion-head charging systems, a
   first principles, multi-dimensional computer modeling investigation has
   been conducted. The dynamics of the plasma and charging of the top
   surface as a function of rf frequency, voltage waveform and material
   properties will be discussed, with comparison of our results to

Abstract = {{Atmospheric pressure corona electric discharges are important components
   of electrophotographic (EP) printing technologies for charging surfaces
   and photoconductors. A typical corona discharge consists of a wire
   biased with dc potential of 100's V plus a few kV of ac bias. An
   electric discharge is produced around the corona wire from which
   electrons drift along the applied electric field to charge the
   underlying surface. This reduces the voltage drop across the gap which
   then terminates the discharge. In printing this underlying surface is
   continuously moving during charging. As a result, the corona discharge
   is re-ignited by the increased voltage drop provided by the incoming
   uncharged surface. To aid in development of these devices, an
   investigation based on first principles, multi-dimensional computer
   modeling has been conducted. We found that the uniformity of the
   summation of these charging cycles is sensitive to the conductivity,
   dielectric constant and speed of the moving surface, and the voltage
   waveform. Parametric results for charging of surfaces while varying
   these parameters will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, Lyapunov theory is used firstly to analyze the motion
   characteristics of the tractor-trailer system. Then, a novel mixed
   logical dynamics (MLD) model is proposed to describe the kinematic of
   the tractor-trailer system. For the resulting MLD model, an extended
   cost function with quadratic form is addressed, in which the steering
   angle of the tractor, as well as two errors combining the position and
   the orientation of the trailer are considered. To minimize the tracking
   error of the trailer, and smooth the steering angle behavior of the
   tractor, an equivalent linear quadratic tracking problem is presented.
   In view of this problem, an explicit model predictive control (MPC)
   controller is designed, by employing the multi-parametric mixedinteger
   quadratic programming (mp-MIQP) technique. Finally, the controller
   performance is evaluated through simulation, and achieves the

Abstract = {{With multi-core processors now mainstream, the shift to many-core
   processors poses a new set of design challenges. In particular, the
   scalability of coherence protocols remains a significant challenge.
   While complex Network-on-Chip interconnect fabrics have been proposed
   and in some cases implemented, most of industry has slowly evolved
   existing coherence solutions to meet the needs of a growing number of
   cores. Industries' slow adoption of Networkon- Chip designs is in large
   part due to the significant effort needed to design and verify the
   system. However, simply scaling bus-based coherence is not
   straightforward either because of increased contention and latency on
   the bus for large core counts.
   This paper proposes a new architecture, XPoint, which does not need to
   modify existing bus-based snooping coherence protocols to scale to 64
   core systems. XPoint employs interleaved cache structures with detailed
   floorplaning and system analysis to reduce contention at high core
   counts. Results show that the XPoint system achieves, on average, a 28x
   and 35x speedup over a single core design on the Splash2 benchmarks for
   a 32 and 64 core system respectively (a 1.6x improvement over a 64 core
   conventional bus). XPoint is also evaluated as a 3D stacked system to
   reduce further bus latency. Results show a 29x and 45x speedup for 32
   and 64 core systems respectively (a 2.1x improvement over a 64 core
   conventional bus and within 8\% of the speedup of a 64 core system with
   an ideal interconnect). Measurements also show that the XPoint system
   decreases bus contention of a 64 core system to only 13\% higher than
   that of an 8-core design (a 29x improvement over a 64 core conventional
   bus).}},

Abstract = {{Iterative adaptive on-off control is a potential control strategy for
   ultra-low-power control of micro-actuators that behave as capacitive
   loads. Such an approach allows for relatively low sensor sampling
   frequencies and the use of simple switched inputs, which can be
   implemented at lower power levels than control with analog inputs and
   real-time feedback. A technique is presented for estimating the
   convergence time of an on-off controller proposed for controlling
   stepping motion in autonomous micro-robots. Error in measured outputs at
   each iteration are estimated using upper bounds on output error as a
   function of error in on-off switching times and lower bounds on the
   change in on-off switching times from iteration to iteration. While a
   strict upper bound on error is not provided by the final error estimator
   simulation and experimental results from the test case of a
   piezoelectric micro-robotic leg joint indicate reasonable agreement
   between estimated error and full controller behavior Convergence
   estimates may then be used to improve controller design with respect to
   total energy consumed}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and simulation results of a model
   predictive controller (MPC) applied to the longitudinal dynamics of a
   lighter-than-air wind energy system being pioneered by Altaeros
   Energies. The unique Altaeros design features a traditional horizontal
   axis wind turbine that is held aloft by a buoyant shroud, which is
   tethered to a ground based platform. This structure provides access to
   strong, high-altitude winds, requires minimal setup, and builds upon
   proven aerostat components, making the system an attractive component in
   expanding wind energy throughout the world. However, because the system
   replaces a conventional tower with tethers, its dynamics are highly
   susceptible to variations in the wind. In particular the control system
   must keep the shroud pitch angle and tether tensions within acceptable
   bounds in order to maintain stable operation and remain within
   structural limitations of the system. In this paper, we apply MPC to
   achieve desirable longitudinal system performance while simultaneously
   enforcing the constraints. We describe the longitudinal dynamic model of
   the system, detail the linear MPC design, and provide simulation results
   on both the linearized and nonlinear system for a variety of real-world
   wind conditions, including a Dryden turbulence model and data acquired
   from the Altaeros functional prototype test site at Loring Air Force
   Base in Limestone, Maine.}},

Abstract = {{Using state-of-the-art engine technologies, current gasoline internal
   combustion engines of passenger vehicles convert only 25 similar to 35\%

   are wasted as heat through engine cooling and exhaust gas systems. One
   of the promising technologies that can dramatically improve fuel economy
   is the waste heat recovery system using Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). The
   working fluid of the ORC, however, undergoes both liquid and gas phases
   throughout the cycle, and it is a challenge to develop heat exchanger
   models that can be used in a simple and efficient dynamic ORC model. In
   this study, a simplified ordinary differential equation (ODE) ORC model
   is developed for system-level design and control studies. First, the
   first principles model of heat exchange dynamics is described by two
   partial differential equations (PDE) and one ODE, and then the
   moving-boundary approach is used to lump the distributed parameters of
   the heat exchanger by integrating three governing equations over each
   length of three phases (gas, two-phase, and liquid). The simulation
   results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic ORC model provides key
   transient dynamics of the ORC with much less computational load.}},

   Programming (MODP) algorithm. The algorithm is applied to obtain the
   optimal supervisory control for PHEVs to minimize two objectives - total

   The algorithm integrates the concept of crowding distance from the
   Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEA) literature. This distance
   metric is used to refine the optimal Pareto front at every time step for
   each state discretization. The refinement of the Pareto front
   significantly reduces the computational time and memory required for
   MODP, making it feasible. At the same time, the results show that the
   refinement retains optimality and produces a Pareto front with a good
   spread ranging from one extremal point to the other. The results also
   reveal interesting insights for the tradeoffs that can be achieved in
   minimizing the CO2 emissions and cost objectives for the underlying grid
   mix and driving conditions assumed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic design methodology for split hybrid
   vehicles using a single planetary gearset (PG) as the transmission. The
   design methodology consists of four steps: I) analyze clutch locations
   on the PG and operation modes, 2) generate dynamic models, 3) evaluate
   drivability (acceleration performance) via forward simulations, and 4)
   optimize the fuel economy using the dynamic programming technique. The
   1-PG split hybrid transmission can have 12 configurations, and each
   configuration can have four operation modes when three clutches are
   added. This methodology systematically evaluates all configuration
   candidates and identifies the optimal design, and we demonstrate how it
   helps to identify a simplified design based in the output-split
   configuration used by the Chevy Volt. The simplified design, named the
   Volt, has only two of the four operation modes of the original Volt. The
   Volt(-) achieves the same fuel economy as the original Volt in the FUDS
   cycle, and has only slightly reduced drivability and fuel economy in the
   HWFET cycle. In addition, an improved design based on the input-split
   configuration used by the Toyota Prius is also identified, named the
   Prius(+), which has one additional mode than the original Prius. The
   Prius+ outperforms the Prius in both drivability and fuel economy.}},

Abstract = {{Stringent engine emission regulations highlight the importance of proper
   engine control during transient operation. In recent years, fast
   emissions analyzers that measure CO and CO2 simultaneously have allowed
   for fast air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) calculation under steady-state engine
   operation. However, using a steady-state methodology to calculate APR
   under transient conditions can lead to significant data interpretation
   errors. This research introduces an experimental cycle-by-cycle APR
   calculation routine developed for transient operation using
   cycle-resolved CO2 and CO analyzers. Need for the new technique arises
   when the composition of recycled exhaust gases vary significantly from
   expected post-combustion products corresponding to the true in-cylinder
   APR. This condition commonly occurs when APR is changed from one cycle
   to the next. The peak difference between the new method and traditional
   methods is demonstrated to be in the range of 0.1 relative air-to-fuel
   ratio points, or approximately 10\%. These results are for low dilution
   conditions where the new method should show minimal difference as
   compared to traditional methods. If residual gas fraction levels were
   increased the difference in corrected to uncorrected results would
   become even greater, motivating the use of the new method in
   high-dilution engines.}},

Abstract = {{Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion allows for the
   use of fuels with octane requirements below that of spark-ignited
   engines. A reference gasoline was compared with iso-octane and a low
   octane blend of gasoline and 40\% n-heptane, NH40. Experiments were
   conducted on a single cylinder engine operating with negative valve
   overlap (NVO). The fuel flow rate per cycle was compensated based on the
   lower heating value to maintain a constant energy addition across fuels.
   Iso-octane and gasoline demonstrated similar maximum load, achieving a
   gross IMEPg of similar to 430 kPa, whereas the NH40 demonstrated an
   increased IMEPg of similar to 460kPa. The NH40 could be operated at a
   later phasing compared with the higher octane fuels, and exhibited a
   shorter burn duration at a given fueling rate and phasing. These results
   could be due to compositional differences, as NH40 required less NVO
   compared to iso-octane and gasoline, leading to less thermal and
   compositional stratification, as well as a higher O-2 concentration and
   less residual gas. Additionally, the NH40 fuel demonstrated a higher
   intermediate temperature heat release than the higher octane fuels,
   potentially contributing to the shorter burn duration. Overall, these
   results demonstrate clear benefits to NVO enabled HCCI combustion with
   low octane fuels.}},

Abstract = {{The HCCI combustion process is highly reliant upon a favorable
   in-cylinder thermal environment in an engine, for a given fuel.
   Commercial fuels can differ considerably in composition and
   auto-ignition chemistry, hence strategies intended to bring HCCI to
   market must account for this fuel variability.
   To this end, a test matrix consisting of eight gasoline fuels comprised
   of blends made solely from refinery streams were run in an experimental,
   single cylinder HCCI engine. All fuels contained 10\% ethanol by volume
   and were representative of a cross-section of fuels one would expect to
   find at gasoline pumps across the United States. The properties of the
   fuels were varied according to research octane number (RON), sensitivity
   (S=RON-MON) and volumetric content of aromatics and olefins.
   For each fuel, a sweep of load (mass of fuel injected per cycle) was
   conducted and the intake air temperature was adjusted in order to keep
   the crank angle of the 50\% mass fraction burned point (CA50) constant.
   By analyzing the amount of temperature compensation required to maintain
   constant combustion phasing, it was possible to determine the
   sensitivity of HCCI to changes in load for various fuels.
   In addition, the deviation of fuel properties brought about variations
   in important engine performance metrics like specific fuel consumption.
   Though the injected energy content per cycle was matched at the baseline
   point across the test fuel matrix, thermodynamic differences resulted in
   a spread of specific fuel consumption for the fuels tested.}},

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring thermal stratification significantly impacts the
   characteristics of HCCI combustion. The in-cylinder gas temperature
   distributions prior to combustion dictate the ignition phasing, burn
   rates, combustion efficiency, and unburned hydrocarbon and CO emissions
   associated with HCCI operation. Characterizing the gas temperature
   fields in an HCCI engine and correlating them to HCCI burn rates is a
   prerequisite for developing strategies to expand the HCCI operating
   range.
   To study the development of thermal stratification in more detail, a new
   analysis methodology for post-processing experimental HCCI engine data
   is proposed. This analysis tool uses the autoignition integral in the
   context of the mass fraction burned curve to infer information about the
   distribution of temperature that exists in the cylinder prior to
   combustion. An assumption is made about the shape of the charge
   temperature profiles of the unburned gas during compression and after
   combustion starts elsewhere in the cylinder. Secondly, it is assumed
   that chemical reaction rates proceed very rapidly in comparison to the
   staggering of ignition phasing from thermal stratification. The
   autoignition integral is then coupled to the mass fraction burned curve
   to produce temperature-mass distributions that are representative of a
   particular combustion event. Due to the computational efficiency
   associated with this zero-dimensional calculation, a large number of
   zones can be simulated at very little computational expense.
   The temperature-mass distributions are then studied over a coolant
   temperature sweep. The results show that very small changes to
   compression heat transfer can shift the distribution of mass and
   temperature in the cylinder enough to significantly affect HCCI burn
   rates and emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Kinesin is a processive molecular motor that transports various cellular
   cargoes by converting chemical energy into mechanical movements.
   Although the motion of a single molecule has been characterized in
   several studies, the dynamics of collective transports remains
   unresolved. Since the fluctuating load acting on each motor is an
   important factor in the collective transport, the relation between the
   varying force and the chemical reaction of kinesin is considered using a
   stochastic mechanistic model. Several metrics are developed to measure
   the correlation among the motion of the motors, the force distribution,
   and the power loss. It is shown that both large external load and stiff
   cargo linkers cause highly correlated motions of motors. However, these
   correlated motions do not lead to faster collective transport.}},

Abstract = {{A piezoelectric device is introduced and modeled to directly interact
   with the tires of passing vehicles and generate electrical power for
   roadside applications. Piezoelectric beams are vertically placed on the
   surface Of the road to generate energy from the load of passing vehices.
   A metal cap is connected to the top end of the bimorphs. The vertical
   motion of the metal cap is limited by the containing fixture of the
   device. Tires of the passing vehicles pass over the metal cap and force
   the bimorph into buckling. The buckling of the piezoelectric beam
   generates significant amount of power. By controlling the extent of
   deformation of the beam we make sure that the beam is not damaged by the
   buckling. To this end, the amount of axial recession of the metal cap
   (equal to axial deformation of the beam) is precision controlled by the
   containing fixture. When the beam deflects it axially shrinks due to
   geometric nonlinearities. This lowers the metal cap. After a certain
   amount of deformation the metal cap rests on the containing fixture and
   the tire load is no more transmitted to the piezoelectric beam.
   In this paper the performance of the proposed energy harvesting device
   is analytically modeled. Geometric nonlinearities and piezoelectric
   couplings have been included in the model. The vibrations of the device
   are transient. Power is generated when the tire pushes down the metal
   cap and when the metal cap springs back after the tire has passed. The
   design criteria for the device are discussed. It is demonstrated that
   the device can be realized with commonly used piezoelectric patches and
   can generate hundreds of milliwatts from the moving traffic. The device
   is not prone to resonance and generates notable amounts of power from
   passing of each tire. It therefore can be used as a self-sufficient
   sensor for traffic control.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented Reality (AR) combines real-world visual data with an overlay
   of computer graphics, enhancing the original video feed. AR can improve
   communication between robots and users via an intuitive spatial and
   visual dialogue, making it an attractive tool for teleoperated robot
   user interfaces (UIs). Many Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) teleoperation
   tasks require both chassis navigation and manipulator arm control;
   however existing literature usually focuses on one task or the other, so
   there exists a gap in mobile robot UIs that take advantage of AR for
   both navigation and manipulation. This work describes the development
   and initial testing of a low-cost alpha-design UI for a teleoperated
   mobile manipulation task that uses AR technology to help the user feel
   more present in the robot's environment. The results of the initial user
   tests are to be used to guide the future development of the user

Abstract = {{Regeneration of bone-ligament complexes destroyed due to disease or
   injury is a clinical challenge due to complex topologies and tissue
   integration required for functional restoration. Attempts to reconstruct
   soft-hard tissue interfaces have met with limited clinical success. In
   this investigation, we manufactured biomimetic fiber-guiding scaffolds
   using solid free-form fabrication methods that custom fit complex
   anatomical defects to guide functionally-oriented ligamentous fibers in
   vivo. Compared to traditional, amorphous or random-porous polymeric
   scaffolds, the use of perpendicularly oriented micro-channels provides
   better guidance for cellular processes anchoring ligaments between two
   distinct mineralized structures. These structures withstood
   biomechanical loading to restore large osseous defects. Cell
   transplantation using hybrid scaffolding constructs with guidance
   channels resulted in predictable oriented fiber architecture, greater
   control of tissue infiltration, and better organization of ligament
   interface than random scaffold architectures. These findings demonstrate
   that fiber-guiding scaffolds drive neogenesis of triphasic bone-ligament
   integration for a variety of clinical scenarios. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
