Abstract = {{We describe a platform to derive, culture, and differentiate genomically
   stable, transgene-free human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) on a
   fully synthetic polymer substrate made of a grafted zwitterionic
   hydrogel: poly2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium
   hydroxide (PMEDSAH). Three independent transgene-free iPSC lines derived
   in these conditions demonstrated continuous self-renewal, genomic
   stability, and pluripotency in vitro and in vivo after up to 9 months of
   continuous in vitro culture on PMEDSAH-grafted plates. Together, these
   data demonstrate the strength this alternative platform offers to
   generate and maintain human iPSCs for regenerative medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic injuries involving the face are very common, yet the clinical
   management of the resulting craniofacial deficiencies is challenging.
   These injuries are commonly associated with missing teeth, for which
   replacement is compromised due to inadequate jawbone support. Using cell
   therapy, we report the upper jaw reconstruction of a patient who lost
   teeth and 75\% of the supporting jawbone following injury. A mixed
   population of bone marrow-derived autologous stem and progenitor cells
   was seeded onto beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), which served as a
   scaffold to deliver cells directly to the defect. Conditions
   (temperature, incubation time) to achieve the highest cell survival and
   seeding efficiency were optimized. Four months after cell therapy, cone
   beam computed tomography and a bone biopsy were performed, and oral
   implants were placed to support an engineered dental prosthesis. Cell
   seeding efficiency (>81\%) of the beta-TCP and survival during the
   seeding process (94\%) were highest when cells were incubated with
   beta-TCP for 30 minutes, regardless of incubation temperature; however,
   at 1 hour, cell survival was highest when incubated at 4 C. Clinical,
   radiographic, and histological analyses confirmed that by 4 months, the
   cell therapy regenerated 80\% of the original jawbone deficiency with
   vascularized, mineralized bone sufficient to stably place oral implants.
   Functional and aesthetic rehabilitation of the patient was successfully
   completed with installation of a dental prosthesis 6 months following
   implant placement. This proof-of-concept clinical report used an
   evidence-based approach for the cell transplantation protocol used and
   is the first to describe a cell therapy for craniofacial trauma
   reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the growth of highly oriented CdSe and ZnTe films at
   similar to 300 degrees C on amorphous substrates such as glass and
   flexible polyimide using ultrathin tetradymite buffer layers composed of
   SbxBi2-xTe3 alloys lattice-matched to the film overgrowth. This leads to
   significant improvement of the crystallinity, roughness, grain size, and
   pit density of the II-VI overlayer along with enhancement of the
   optoelectronic properties. For example, photoluminescence emission is
   observed at similar to 1.74 eV for optimized CdSe films, the same as in
   a single crystal reference. An in-plane carrier diffusion length of
   similar to 500 nm is inferred from transient optical data. The use of
   tetradymite buffer layers to control II-VI compound deposition on
   non-crystalline substrates is a promising route for large area
   optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaic, light-emission, or

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Fabrication of smooth thin films of topological insulators with true
   insulating bulk are extremely important for utilizing their novel
   properties in quantum and spintronic devices. Here, we report the growth
   of crystalline thin films of SmB6, a topological Kondo insulator with
   true insulating bulk, by co-sputtering both SmB6 and B targets. X-ray
   diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy
   indicate films that are polycrystalline with a (001) preferred
   orientation. When cooling down, resistivity rho shows an increase around
   50K and saturation below 10 K, consistent with the opening of the
   hybridization gap and surface dominated transport, respectively. The
   ratio rho(2K)/rho(300K) is only about two, much smaller than that of
   bulk, which indicates a much larger surface-to-bulk ratio. Point contact
   spectroscopy using a superconductor tip on SmB6 films shows both a Kondo
   Fano resonance and Andeev reflection, indicating an insulating Kondo
   lattice with metallic surface states. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1371-1385}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports on a generic factor-based method for node removal in
   factor-graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which we call
   generic linear constraints (GLCs). The need for a generic node removal
   tool is motivated by long-term SLAM applications, whereby nodes are
   removed in order to control the computational cost of graph
   optimization. GLC is able to produce a new set of linearized factors
   over the elimination clique that can represent either the true
   marginalization (i.e., dense GLC) or a sparse approximation of the true
   marginalization using a Chow-Liu tree (i.e., sparse GLC). The proposed
   algorithm improves upon commonly used methods in two key ways: First, it
   is not limited to graphs with strictly full-state relative-pose factors
   and works equally well with other low-rank factors, such as those
   produced by monocular vision. Second, the new factors are produced in
   such a way that accounts for measurement correlation, which is a problem
   encountered in other methods that rely strictly upon pairwise
   measurement composition. We evaluate the proposed method over multiple
   real-world SLAM graphs and show that it outperforms other recently
   proposed methods in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Additionally,
   we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed GLC method provides a
   principled and flexible tool to control the computational complexity of
   long-term graph SLAM, with results shown for 34.9 h of real-world
   indoor-outdoor data covering 147.4 km collected over 27 mapping sessions
   spanning a period of 15 months.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the dynamic modeling and passivity-based control
   of a planar cable-actuated system. This system is modeled using a
   lumped-mass method that explicitly considers the change in cable
   stiffness and winch inertia that occurs when the cables are wound around
   their respective winches. In order to simplify the modeling process,
   each cable is modeled individually and then constrained to the other
   cables. Exploiting the fact that the payload is much more massive than
   the cables allows the definition of a modified output called the mu-tip
   rate. Coupling the mu-tip rate with a modified input realizes the
   definition of a passive input-output map. The two degrees of freedom of
   the system are controlled by four winches. This overactuation is
   simplified by employing a set of load-sharing parameters that
   effectively reduce four inputs to two. The performance and robustness of
   the controllers are evaluated in the simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Functional relationship networks, which summarize the
   probability of co-functionality between any two genes in the genome,
   could complement the reductionist focus of modern biology for
   understanding diverse biological processes in an organism. One major
   limitation of the current networks is that they are static, while one
   might expect functional relationships to consistently reprogram during
   the differentiation of a cell lineage. To address this potential
   limitation, we developed a novel algorithm that leverages both
   differentiation stage-specific expression data and large-scale
   heterogeneous functional genomic data to model such dynamic changes. We
   then applied this algorithm to the time-course RNA-Seq data we collected
   for ex vivo human erythroid cell differentiation.
   Results: Through computational cross-validation and literature
   validation, we show that the resulting networks correctly predict the
   (de)-activated functional connections between genes during
   erythropoiesis. We identified known critical genes, such as HBD and
   GATA1, and functional connections during erythropoiesis using these
   dynamic networks, while the traditional static network was not able to
   provide such information. Furthermore, by comparing the static and the
   dynamic networks, we identified novel genes (such as OSBP2 and PDZK1IP1)
   that are potential drivers of erythroid cell differentiation. This novel
   method of modeling dynamic networks is applicable to other
   differentiation processes where time-course genome-scale expression data
   are available, and should assist in generating greater understanding of
   the functional dynamics at play across the genome during development.}},

Abstract = {{Information dissemination control is of crucial importance to facilitate
   reliable and efficient data delivery, especially in networks consisting
   of time-varying links or heterogeneous links. Since the abstraction of
   information dissemination much resembles the spread of epidemics,
   epidemic models are utilized to characterize the collective dynamics of
   information dissemination over networks. From a systematic point of
   view, we aim to explore the optimal control policy for information
   dissemination given that the control capability is a function of its
   distribution time, which is a more realistic model in many applications.
   The main contributions of this paper are to provide an analytically
   tractable model for information dissemination over networks, to solve
   the optimal control signal distribution time for minimizing the
   accumulated network cost via dynamic programming, and to establish a
   parametric plug-in model for information dissemination control. In
   particular, we evaluate its performance in mobile and generalized social
   networks as typical examples.}},

Abstract = {{Solving wireless packet retransmission problem (WPRTP) using network
   coding (NC) is increasingly attracting research efforts. However,
   existing NC-based schemes for WPRTP are with high computational
   complexity resulting from computation on larger Galois field (GF(2(q))),
   or the solutions on GF(2) found by the schemes are less efficient. In
   this paper, combining the basic ideas in two existing schemes, denoted
   as ColorNC and CliqueNC, respectively, we present a new scheme named as
   ColorCliqueNC. The advantages of ColorCliqueNC include the following:
   (i) it is suitable for all kinds of WPRTP instances; (ii) it works on
   GF(2); thus, it is computationally efficient than the schemes working on
   larger Galois fields; and (iii) the solutions found by ColorCliqueNC
   usually have fewer packet retransmissions than those by ColorNC and
   CliqueNC despite that they all work on GF(2). Theoretical analysis
   indicates that ColorCliqueNC is superior to ColorNC and CliqueNC.
   Simulation results show that ColorCliqueNC generally outperforms ColorNC
   and CliqueNC. Compared with ColorNC, ColorCliqueNC can save up to 10\%
   packet retransmissions. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the investigation of a microdischarge- based
   approach for sensing the diaphragm deflection in a monolithically
   fabricated pressure sensor. This transduction approach is appealing from
   the viewpoint of miniaturization. The device consists of a deflecting Si
   diaphragm with a sensing cathode, and a glass substrate with an anode
   and a reference cathode. The total exterior volume of the device is 0.05
   mm(3); typical electrode size and separations are 35 and 10 mu m. Pulsed
   microdischarges are initiated in a sealed chamber formed between Si and
   glass chips, and are filled with Ar gas. External pressure deflects the
   Si diaphragm and changes the interelectrode spacing, thereby
   redistributing the current between the anode and two competing cathodes.
   The differential current is indicative of the diaphragm deflection which
   is determined by the external pressure. A 6- mask microfabrication
   process is investigated for device fabrication. Electrode connections to
   the interior of the chamber are provided by laser drilling and copper
   electroplating through high aspect ratio glass vias. The Si and glass
   substrates are bonded by Au- In eutectic. The redistribution of plasma
   current between competing cathodes, as a consequence of diaphragm
   deflection over a range of pressure, was experimentally demonstrated.
   First principles modeling of transient microdischarges have provided
   insights to the fundamental processes responsible for the differential
   current and guidance for scaling the device to smaller dimension.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes resonant wireless strain sensors fabricated from
   magnetoelastic alloys. The transduction mechanism is the Delta E
   effect-the change in stiffness of magnetoelastic materials with applied
   strain or magnetic field. This is measured as a shift in the resonant
   frequency and is detected wirelessly using pick-up coils utilizing the
   magnetoelastic coupling of these materials. The sensors are fabricated
   from a 28-mu m-thick foil of Metglas 2826 MB (Fe40Ni38Mo4B18), a
   ferromagnetic magnetoelastic alloy, using microelectrodischarge
   machining. Two sensor types are described-single and differential. The
   single sensor has an active area of 7 x 2 mm(2), excluding the anchors.
   At 23 degrees C, it operates at a resonant frequency of 230.8 kHz and
   has a sensitivity of 13 x 10(3) ppm/mstrain; the dynamic range is
   0.05-1.05 mstrain. The differential sensor includes a strain independent
   reference resonator of area 2 x 0.5 mm(2) in addition to a sensing
   element of area 2.5 x 0.5 mm(2) that is divided into two segments. The
   sensor resonance is at 266.4 kHz and reference resonance is at 492.75
   kHz. The differential sensor provides a dynamic range for 0-1.85 mstrain
   with a sensitivity of 12.5 x 10(3) ppm/mstrain at 23 degrees C. The
   reference resonator of the differential sensor is used to compensate for
   the temperature dependence of the Young's modulus of Metglas 2826 MB,
   which is experimentally estimated to be -524 ppm/degrees C. For an
   increment of 35 degrees C, uncompensated sensors exhibit a resonant
   frequency shift of up to 42\% of the dynamic range for the single sensor
   and 30\% of the dynamic range of the differential sensor, underscoring
   the necessity of temperature compensation. The geometry of both types of
   sensors can be modified to accommodate a variety of sensitivity and
   dynamic range requirements.}},

Abstract = {{High frequency large scanning angle electrostatically actuated
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) mirrors are used in a variety of
   applications involving fast optical scanning. A 1-D parametrically
   resonant torsional micromirror for use in biomedical imaging is analyzed
   here with respect to operation by duty-cycled square waves. Duty-cycled
   square wave excitation can have significant advantages for practical
   mirror regulation and/or control. The mirror's nonlinear dynamics under
   such excitation is analyzed in a Hill's equation form. This form is used
   to predict stability regions (the voltage-frequency relationship) of
   parametric resonance behavior over large scanning angles using iterative
   approximations for nonlinear capacitance behavior of the mirror.
   Numerical simulations are also performed to obtain the mirror's
   frequency response over several voltages for various duty cycles.
   Frequency sweeps, stability results, and duty cycle trends from both
   analytical and simulation methods are compared with experimental
   results. Both analytical models and simulations show good agreement with
   experimental results over the range of duty cycled excitations tested.
   This paper discusses the implications of changing amplitude and phase
   with duty cycle for robust open-loop operation and future closed-loop
   operating strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Substrate topography plays a critical role in the function of nano-scale
   materials and devices. We study small molecular organic light emitting
   devices (OLEDs) deposited onto non-planar substrates, where the
   substrate's radius of curvature in some regions approaches the thickness
   of the active device layers. As a result, the electric field profile
   inside the organic charge transport layers is modified, influencing
   carrier injection, transport, and light emission properties. Experiments
   and numerical modeling suggest that charge balance and
   electroluminescence efficiency potentially can be improved in electron
   injection-limited OLED architectures via substrate geometry. These
   findings elucidate the optoelectronic behavior (and degradation) of
   OLEDs on imperfect substrates, and suggest a strategy based on substrate
   topography for controlling device behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{To probe the influence of molecular dipole on the open circuit voltage
   (V-OC) of molecular heterojunction organic solar cells, we study axially
   fluorinated boron subphthalocyanine/fullerene (SubPc-F/C-60) junctions.
   These exhibit an open-circuit voltage V-OC = 1.00 V, a value closer to
   the HOMO-LUMO offset at the donor-acceptor interface = 1.69 eV than the
   V-OC = 1.06 V measured for junctions between the archetypal chlorinated
   SubPc and C-60, with corresponding HOMO-LUMO offset = 1.84 eV. Aside
   from the axial halogen substitution, the two compounds exhibit similar
   molecular structure and optical absorption. The energy levels and
   structure of the heteromolecular polaron pair are calculated, and the
   ideal organic diode model for SubPc-Cl is modified accordingly,
   successfully reproducing the experimental SubPc-F device
   characteristics. The reproducible difference in V-OC is attributed to
   the different electric dipole strength between SubPc-F and SubPc-Cl and
   its influence on polaron pair dynamics at the heterojunction. (C) 2014

Title = {{Self-organization of single filaments and diffusive plasmas during a
   single pulse in dielectric-barrier discharges}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Self-organization of filaments in dielectric-barrier discharges (DBDs)
   probably has many origins. However, the dominant cause is proposed to be
   the accumulation of charge on the surfaces of the bounding dielectrics
   that reinforces successive discharge pulses to occur at the same
   locations. A secondary cause is the electrostatic repulsion of
   individual plasma filaments. Self-organization typically develops over
   many discharge pulses. In this paper, we discuss the results of a
   computational investigation of plasma filaments in overvoltage DBDs
   that, under select conditions, display self-organized patterns (SOPs) of
   plasma density during a single discharge pulse. (Overvoltage refers to
   the rapid application of a voltage in excess of the quasi-dc breakdown
   voltage.) The origin of the SOPs is a synergistic relationship between
   the speed of the surface-ionization waves that propagate along each
   dielectric and the rate at which avalanche occurs across the gap. For
   our test conditions, SOPs were not observed at lower voltages and
   gradually formed at higher voltages. The same conditions that result in
   SOPs, i.e. the application of an overvoltage, also produce more diffuse
   discharges. A transition from a single narrow filament to a more diffuse
   structure was observed as overvoltage was approached. The sensitivity of
   SOPs to the orientation and permittivity of the bounding dielectrics is
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Branching and path-deviation of positive streamers resulting from
   statistical photon transport}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The branching and change in direction of propagation (path-deviation) of
   positive streamers in molecular gases such as air likely require a
   statistical process which perturbs the head of the streamer and produces
   an asymmetry in its space charge density. In this paper, the mechanisms
   for path-deviation and branching of atmospheric pressure positive
   streamer discharges in dry air are numerically investigated from the
   viewpoint of statistical photon transport and photoionization. A
   statistical photon transport model, based on randomly selected emitting
   angles and mean-free-path for absorption, was developed and embedded
   into a fluid-based plasma transport model. The hybrid model was applied
   to simulations of positive streamer coaxial discharges in dry air at
   atmospheric pressure. The results show that secondary streamers, often
   spatially isolated, are triggered by the random photoionization and
   interact with the thin space charge layer (SCL) of the primary streamer.
   This interaction may be partly responsible for path-deviation and
   streamer branching. The general process consists of random remote
   photo-electron production which initiates a back-traveling electron
   avalanche, collision of this secondary avalanche with the primary
   streamer and the subsequent perturbation to its SCL. When the SCL is
   deformed from a symmetric to an asymmetric shape, the streamer can
   experience an abrupt change in the direction of propagation. If the SCL
   is sufficiently perturbed and essentially broken, local maxima in the
   SCL can develop into new streamers, leading to streamer branching.
   During the propagation of positive streamers, this mechanism can take
   place repetitively in time and space, thus producing multi-level
   branching and more than two branches within one level.}},

Abstract = {{Canonical isoforms in different databases have been defined as the most
   prevalent, most conserved, most expressed, longest, or the one with the
   clearest description of domains or posttranslational modifications. In
   this article, we revisit these definitions of canonical isoforms based
   on functional genomics and proteomics evidence, focusing on mouse data.
   We report a novel functional relationship network-based approach for
   identifying the highest connected isoforms (HCIs). We show that 46\% of
   these HCIs are not the longest transcripts. In addition, this approach
   revealed many genes that have more than one highly connected isoforms.
   Averaged across 175 RNA-seq datasets covering diverse tissues and
   conditions, 65\% of the HCIs show higher expression levels than
   nonhighest connected isoforms at the transcript level. At the protein
   level, these HCIs highly overlap with the expressed splice variants,
   based on proteomic data from eight different normal tissues. These
   results suggest that a more confident definition of canonical isoforms
   can be made through integration of multiple lines of evidence, including
   HCIs defined by biological processes and pathways, expression prevalence
   at the transcript level, and relative or absolute abundance at the
   protein level. This integrative proteogenomics approach can successfully
   identify principal isoforms that are responsible for the canonical
   functions of genes.}},

Abstract = {{Charging infrastructure is critical to the development of electric
   vehicle (EV) system. While many countries have implemented great policy
   efforts to promote EVs, how to build charging infrastructure to maximize
   overall travel electrification given how people travel has not been well
   studied. Mismatch of demand and infrastructure can lead to
   under-utilized charging stations, wasting public resources. Estimating
   charging demand has been challenging due to lack of realistic vehicle
   travel data. Public charging is different from refueling from two
   aspects: required time and home-charging possibility. As a result,
   traditional approaches for refueling demand estimation (e.g. traffic
   flow and vehicle ownership density) do not necessarily represent public
   charging demand. This research uses large-scale trajectory data of
   11,880 taxis in Beijing as a case study to evaluate how travel patterns
   mined from big-data can inform public charging infrastructure
   development. Although this study assumes charging stations to be
   dedicated to a fleet of PHEV taxis which may not fully represent the
   real-world situation, the methodological framework can be used to
   analyze private vehicle trajectory data as well to improve our
   understanding of charging demand for electrified private fleet. Our
   results show that (1) collective vehicle parking ``hotspots{''} are good
   indicators for charging demand; (2) charging stations sited using travel
   patterns can improve electrification rate and reduce gasoline
   consumption; (3) with current grid mix, emissions of CO2, PM, SO2, and
   NOx will increase with taxi electrification; and (4) power demand for
   public taxi charging has peak load around noon, overlapping with
   Beijing's summer peak power. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-1-nA operating current conductive-bridge resistive memory devices
   showing pronounced rectifying behavior have been demonstrated in a cell
   structure consisting of Cu top electrode, atomic layer deposition Al2O3
   switching film and polysilicon bottom electrode as an in-cell resistor.
   This ultralow current provides energy savings by minimizing write,
   erase, and read currents. Despite having such low currents, excellent
   retention, ON/OFF ratio, and endurance have been demonstrated. Devices
   programmed with <1-nA peak current pass 6 h retention test at 85 degrees
   C and show no significant degradation after 10 000 write/erase cycles.
   Due to the partially formed filament, the devices at ON-state exhibit
   pronounced nonlinear I-V and current rectification-both factors are very
   beneficial for RRAM array operation. Multilevel storage can be obtained
   by controlling the filament shape through compliance current.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the challenging issue of estimating virtual unmodeled
   dynamics is addressed. A novel estimation algorithm based on historical
   data and the output of low-order approximation models for virtual
   un-modeled dynamics is presented. In particular, the virtual un-modeled
   dynamics are decomposed into known and unknown parts, where only the
   unknown part is to be estimated. The method effectively avoids the need
   to use the unknown control input directly, and enables the estimation of
   the un-modeled dynamics with a relatively simple algorithm. Moreover, it
   is shown that the proposed algorithm overcomes the difficulty in
   obtaining the control solutions caused by the fact that the controller
   input is embedded in un-modeled dynamics. Finally, simulation studies
   are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic contact problems involving Euler Bernoulli beams or Kirchhoff
   plates generally involve concentrated contact forces. Linear elasticity
   (e.g. finite element) solutions of the same problems show that finite
   contact regions are actually developed, but these regions have
   dimensions that are typically of the order of the beam thickness. Thus
   if beam theory is appropriate for a given structural problem, the local
   elasticity fields can be explored by asymptotic methods and will have
   fairly general (problem independent) characteristics. Here we show that
   the extent of the contact region is a fixed ratio of the beam thickness
   which is independent of the concentrated load predicted by the beam
   theory, and that the distribution of contact pressure in this region has
   a universal form, which is well approximated by a simple algebraic
   expression. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous polymers have been extensively used for energy dissipative
   applications due to their relatively low density and controllable rate
   dependent damping. In general, molecular mobility depends on the rate of
   applied loading and the ambient temperature, and results in a wide
   variety of mechanical properties. The variation in the macromolecular
   chain dynamics can be obtained by altering the chemical architecture and
   morphology of the constituent monomers. The present study is focused on
   finding a correlation between the chemical structure of the constituent
   monomer and the rate dependent viscous damping of the macromolecules.
   Polyurethane (PU) made up of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and
   polycaprolactone diol (PCL) is considered to estimate the effect of soft
   segments (diol content) on damping property of PU. A linear viscoelastic
   mathematical model (based on standard-linear solid (SLS) model) is used
   to extract the rate dependent relaxation time constants for the
   materials. It is found that increasing the soft segment content in the
   PU does not improve damping limitlessly. Beyond a critical percentage of
   soft segment content, characteristic relaxation times have a significant
   drop. Further, the analysis is extended for PU-clay nanocomposites and a
   correlation between the clay volume fraction and relaxation constants is
   established. The study will help to choose and design PU and volume
   percentage of clay nanoparticle for manufacturing PU-clay nanocomposites
   with desired damping property.}},

Abstract = {{Effective techniques that allow children to complete magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) scans without sedation are high priority for the imaging
   community. We used behavioral approaches to scan 64 sleeping infants and
   toddlers younger than 4 years, and 156 awake children aged 2.5 to 18
   years, for a neuroimaging research protocol. Infants and their families
   participated in a desensitization protocol for several days, then
   scanning was performed at the child's bedtime during natural sleep. For
   awake young children, a behavioral protocol was used that included
   tangible reinforcers, exploration of the scanner environment and a brief
   practice session. Two scan sessions were targeted for awake children.
   Success rates by participant were quantified in terms of the proportion
   of requisite scans in each session that were successfully acquired. The
   average success rate in sleeping infants and toddlers was 0.461. For
   awake children aged 2.5 to 6 years, success rates for each session were
   0.739 and 0.847. For children aged 7 years and older, success rates were
   over 0.900 for both the sessions. Overall, though success was lower
   later in a scan session for both sleeping infants and awake young
   children, our results demonstrate that it is feasible to collect
   high-quality imaging data using standard imaging sequences in infants
   and children without sedation.}},

Abstract = {{China's CO2 emissions have sharply increased in recent years with
   soaring economic development and urbanization. Consumption-based
   accounting of CO2 emissions could provide new insights for allocating
   regional mitigation responsibility and curbing the emissions. A
   multi-regional input-output model is used to study the trends and
   disparities of consumption-based emissions from Chinese provinces during
   the period 2002-2007. Results show that China's consumption-based CO2
   emissions grew from 3549 Mt in 2002 to 5403 Mt in 2007 with an annual
   average growth rate of 8.8\%. The annual growth rate in the richer
   eastern region was over 10\% because of a rapid increase in capital
   investment and the growth of urban consumption. Consumption-based CO2
   emissions embodied in interprovincial trades contributed only 10\% (351
   Mt) to the national total of such emissions in 2002, but 16\% (864 Mt)
   in 2007. Given low per capita emissions currently, China's
   consumption-based emissions have much room to grow because of further
   development of urbanization and stimulation of domestic demand. The
   government should pay greater attention to controlling CO2 emissions
   from a consumption-based perspective. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To identify clinical variables associated with a positive
   computed tomography (CT) scan and estimate the performance of imaging
   recommendations in patients from a diverse sample of urology practices.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS This study comprised 2380 men with newly diagnosed
   prostate cancer seen at 28 practices in the Michigan Urological Surgery
   Improvement Collaborative from March 2012 through September 2013. Data
   included age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score (GS),
   clinical T stage, total number of positive biopsy cores, whether or not
   the patient received a staging abdominal and/or pelvic CT scan, and CT
   scan result. We fit a multivariate logistic regression model to identify
   clinical variables associated with metastases detected by CT scan. We
   estimated the sensitivity and specificity of existing imaging
   recommendations.
   RESULTS Among 643 men (27.4\%) who underwent a staging CT scan, 62 men
   (9.6\%) had a positive study. In the multivariate analysis, PSA, GS, and
   clinical T stage were independently associated with the occurrence of a
   positive CT scan (all P values <.05). The American Urological
   Association's Best Practice Statements' recommendations for imaging when
   PSA level > 20 ng/mL or GS >= 8 or locally advanced cancer had a
   sensitivity of 87.3\% and specificity of 82.6\%. Compared with current
   practice, implementing this recommendation in the Michigan Urological
   Surgery Improvement Collaborative population was estimated to result in
   approximately 0.5\% of positive study results being missed, and 26.1\%
   of fewer study results overall.
   CONCLUSION Successful implementation of CT imaging criterion of PSA
   level > 20, GS >= 8, or clinical stage >= T3 would ensure that CT scans
   are performed for almost all men who would have positive study results
   while reducing the number of negative study results. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Microbial hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is becoming increasingly
   important for the production of renewable biofuels to address global
   energy concerns. Hemicellulose is the second most abundant
   lignocellulosic biopolymer consisting of mostly xylan and other
   polysaccharides. A variety of enzymes is involved in complete hydrolysis
   of xylan into its constituent sugars for subsequent biofuel
   fermentation. Two enzymes, endo-beta-xylanase and beta-xylosidase, are
   particularly important in hydrolyzing the xylan backbone into
   xylooligosaccharides and individual xylose units. In this study, we
   describe the cloning, expression, and characterization of xylanase and
   beta-xylosidase isolated from Bacillus subtilis M015 in Escherichia
   coli. The genes were identified to encode a 213 amino acid protein for
   xylanase (glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 11) and a 533 amino acid
   protein for beta-xylosidase (GH family 43). Recombinant enzymes were
   produced by periplasmic-leaky E. coli JE5505 and therefore secreted into
   the supernatant during growth. Temperature and pH optima were determined
   to be 50 A degrees C and 5.5-6 for xylanase and 35 A degrees C and
   7.0-7.5 for beta-xylosidase using beech wood xylan and
   p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside as the substrates, respectively. We
   have also investigated the synergy of two enzymes on xylan hydrolysis
   and observed 90 \% increase in total sugar release (composed of xylose,
   xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylotetraose) for xylanase/beta-xylosidase
   combination as opposed to xylanase alone.}},

Abstract = {{Physiologic bioengineering of the oral, dental, and craniofacial complex
   requires optimized geometric organizations of fibrous connective
   tissues. A computer-designed, fiber-guiding scaffold has been developed
   to promote tooth-supporting periodontal tissue regeneration and
   functional restoration despite limited printing resolution for the
   manufacture of submicron-scaled features. Here, we demonstrate the use
   of directional freeze-casting techniques to control pore directional
   angulations and create mimicked topographies to alveolar crest,
   horizontal, oblique, and apical fibers of natural periodontal ligaments.
   For the differing anatomic positions, the gelatin displayed varying
   patterns of ice growth, determined via internal pore architectures.
   Regardless of the freezing coordinates, the longitudinal pore
   arrangements resulted in submicron-scaled diameters (similar to 50 mu
   m), along with corresponding high biomaterial porosity (similar to
   90\%). Furthermore, the horizontal + coronal ((x) over right arrow-(y)
   over right arrow) freezing orientation facilitated the creation of
   similar structures to major fibers in the periodontal ligament
   interface. This periodontal tissue-mimicking microenvironment is a
   potential tissue platform for the generation of naturally oriented
   ligamentous tissues consistent with periodontal ligament neogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{This study details an optimization of the golf swing, where the hand
   path and club angular trajectories are manipulated. The optimization
   goal was to maximize club head velocity at impact within the interaction
   kinetic limitations (force, torque, work, and power) of the golfer as
   determined through the analysis of a typical swing using a
   two-dimensional dynamic model. The study was applied to four subjects
   with diverse swing capabilities and styles. It was determined that it is
   possible for all subjects to increase their club head velocity at impact
   within their respective kinetic limitations through combined
   modifications to their respective hand path and club angular
   trajectories. The manner of the modifications, the degree of velocity
   improvement, the amount of kinetic reduction, and the associated kinetic
   limitation quantities were subject dependent. By artificially minimizing
   selected kinetic inputs within the optimization algorithm, it was
   possible to identify swing trajectory characteristics that indicated
   relative kinetic weaknesses of a subject. Practical implications are
   offered based upon the findings of the study.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers the effects of hole damage on guided wave
   propagation in isotropic and composite plates using both the local
   interaction simulation approach (LISA) and experimental methods. Guided
   wave generation from piezoceramic wafers is modeled using the recently
   developed LISA hybrid approach. First, holes in isotropic plates are
   simulated to establish LISA's ability to capture the guided wave
   scattering effects of various hole sizes. Experimental results are
   compared with the simulations to aid in evaluating the LISA model. Next,
   hole damage in cross-ply composite laminates is modeled and compared
   with experimental results. Various hole sizes and azimuthal locations
   are simulated to determine the effects of varying those parameters.
   Results from both the isotropic and composite damage studies clearly
   display the ability of LISA to model hole damage. Both the simulation
   and experimental results illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of
   various sensor locations relative to the actuator and damage locations.
   Finally, the study shows the ability of the LISA model to capture mode
   conversions resulting from partial thickness holes.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of the Zr(Fe,Cr,Nb)(2) precipitate in a China-brand
   Zr-Sn-Nb-Fe-Cr alloy under a 500 key Ne ion beam irradiation and post
   heating were studied by in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   It is found that the Zr(Fe,Cr,Nb)(2) precipitate with the hexagonal
   close packed (hcp) structure is the major secondary phase particle (SPP)
   in this zirconium alloy. At the temperature of 310 degrees C, the
   precipitate starts to be amorphized after having been irradiated to 0.5
   displacement per atom (dpa). The critical irradiation dose for the
   precipitate to be completely amorphized is 1.0 dpa. The amorphized
   Zr(Fe,Cr,Nb)(2) precipitate starts to be recrystallized when it was
   heated up to 600 degrees C. The temperature for the recrystallization of
   the amorphized Zr(Fe,Cr,Nb)(2) precipitate is determined to be between
   450 degrees C and 600 degrees C. Instead of forming large single grain
   crystals, some nanocrystals that have the same crystal structure to that
   of the precipitate before being amorphized were formed during the
   recrystallization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Four Dimensional Spectral-Spatial Fat Saturation Pulse Design}},

Abstract = {{PurposeThe conventional spectrally selective fat saturation pulse may
   perform poorly with inhomogeneous amplitude of static (polarizing) field
   (B-0) and/or amplitude of (excitation) radiofrequency field (B-1)
   fields. We propose a four dimensional spectral-spatial fat saturation
   pulse that is more robust to B0/B1 inhomogeneity and also shorter than
   the conventional fat saturation pulse.
   TheoryThe proposed pulse is tailored for local B-0 inhomogeneity, which
   avoids the need of a sharp transition band in the spectral domain, so it
   improves both performance and pulse length. Furthermore, it can also
   compensate for B-1 inhomogeneity. The pulse is designed sequentially by
   small-tip-angle approximation design and an automatic rescaling
   procedure.
   MethodsThe proposed method is compared to the conventional fat
   saturation in phantom experiments and in vivo knee imaging at 3 T for
   both single-channel and parallel excitation versions.
   ResultsCompared to the conventional method, the proposed method produces
   superior fat suppression in the presence of B-0 and B-1 inhomogeneity
   and reduces pulse length by up to half of the standard length.
   ConclusionThe proposed four dimensional spectral-spatial fat saturation
   suppresses fat more robustly with shorter pulse length than the
   conventional fat saturation in the presence of B-0 and B-1
   inhomogeneity. Magn Reson Med 72:1637-1647, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley

   the help of the sequential quadratic programming algorithm. Three test
   cases of the equation are solved using the proposed schemes. Statistical
   analysis based on a large number of independent runs is carried out to
   validate the models in terms of accuracy, convergence and computational

   associate sequences to unique points, which allows us to determine when

   thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and estimation of excess lifetime
   cancer risk (ELCR), for the inhabitants of Poonch division of the Azad
   Kashmir, Pakistan. CaF2: Dy (TLD-200) card dosimeters were installed at
   height of 1 m from ground at fifteen different locations covering the
   entire Poonch division comprising of three districts. During three
   distinct two month time periods within the six month study period, all
   the installed dosimeters were exposed to outdoor environmental gamma
   radiations, retrieved and read out at Radiation Dosimetry Laboratory,
   Health Physics Division, PINSTECH laboratory, Islamabad. The ambient
   outdoor gamma dose rate measurements were also taken with NaI (Tl) based
   portable radiometric instrument at 1 m above the ground. To estimate the
   annual gamma doses, NaI (Tl) based survey data were used for one
   complete year following the deployment of the dosimeters. The mean
   annual gamma dose rates measured by TLDs and survey meter were found as
   1.47 +/- 0.10 and 0.862 +/- 0.003 mGy/y respectively. Taking into
   account a 29\% outdoor occupancy factor, the annual average effective
   dose rate for individuals was estimated as 0.298 +/- 0.04 and 0.175 +/-
   0.03 mSv/y by TLDs and survey meter, respectively. For outdoor exposure,
   the ELCR was calculated from the TLD and survey meter measurements. The
   environmental outdoor average annual effective dose obtained in present
   study are less than the estimated world average terrestrial and cosmic
   gamma ray dose rate of 0.9 mSv/y reported in UNSCEAR 2000. The possible
   origins of gamma doses in the area and incompatibilities of results
   obtained from the two different measurement techniques are also
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{161-169}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Methanobactin (mb) is a post-translationally modified copper-binding
   compound, or chalkophore, secreted by many methane-oxidizing bacteria or
   methanotrophs in response to copper limitation. In addition to copper,
   methanobactin from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (mb-OB3b) has been
   shown to bind a variety of metals including Hg2+. In this report, Hg
   binding by the structurally unique methanobactin from Methylocystis
   strain SB2 (mb-SB2) was examined and compared to mb-OB3b. Mb-SB2 is
   shown to bind the common forms of Hg found in aqueous environments,
   Hg2+, Hg(CN)(2) and CH3Hg+. The spectral and thermodynamic properties of
   binding for each form of mercury differed. UV-visible absorption spectra
   suggested that Hg2+ binds to both the oxazolone and imidazolone rings of
   mb-SB2, whereas CH3Hg+ appeared to only bind to the oxazolone ring.
   Hg(CN)(2) showed spectral properties between Hg2+ and CH3Hg+. Isothermal
   titration calorimetry (ITC) showed both Hg(CN)(2) and CH3Hg+ fit into
   two-site binding models. For Hg(CN)(2) the first site was exothermic and
   the second endothermic. Both binding sites in CH3Hg+ were exothermic,
   but at equilibrium the reaction never moved back to the baseline,
   suggesting a slow residual reaction. ITC results for He2+ were more
   complex and suggested a 3- or 4-site model. The spectral, kinetic and
   thermodynamic changes following Hg binding by mb-SB2 also differed from
   the changes associated with mb-OB3b. Like mb-OB3b, copper did not
   displace Hg bound to mb-SB2. In contrast to mb-OB3b Hg2+ could displace
   Cu from Cu-containing mb-SB2 and preferentially bound Hg2+ over Cu2+ at
   metal to mb-SB2 molar ratios above 1.0. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In Starinshak et al. (J Comput Phys 262(1):1-16, 2014), we proposed a
   new level-set model for representing multimaterial flows in multiple
   space dimensions. Rather than associating each level-set function with
   the boundary of a material, the new model associates each level-set
   function with a pair of materials and the interface that separates them.
   In this paper, we extend the model to represent geometries with
   non-smooth boundaries. The model uses multiple level-set functions to
   describe the shape boundary, typically with one level-set function per
   smooth boundary segment. Sign information is collected from all
   level-set functions and a voting algorithm is used to determine the
   interior/exterior of the geometric shape. The model is well suited for
   representing boundaries with singularities; it offers significant
   improvement over standard level-set approaches, both in shape
   preservation and area conservation; and it eliminates the need for
   costly redistancing of the level-set function. Numerical examples
   illustrate the superior performance of the proposed model.}},

Title = {{Energy management strategies comparison for electric vehicles with

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the real-time energy management strategies for a
   hybrid energy storage system (HESS), including a battery and a
   supercapacitor (SC), for an electric city bus. The most attractive
   advantage deriving from HESSs is the possibility of reducing the battery
   current stress to extend its lifetime. To quantitatively compare the
   effects of different control strategies on reducing battery degradation,
   a dynamic degradation model for the LiFePO4 battery is proposed and
   validated in this paper. The battery size is optimized according to the
   requested minimal mileage, while the size of SC is optimized based on
   the power demand profile of the typical China Bus Driving Cycle (CBDC).
   Based on the optimized HESS, a novel fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and a
   novel model predictive controller (MPC) are proposed and compared with
   the existing rule-based controller (RBC) and filtration based controller
   (FBC), after all the controllers are tuned to their best performance
   along the CBDC. It turns out that FLC and RBC achieve the best
   performance among the four controllers, which is validated by the
   DP-based result. Furthermore, about 50\% of the HESS life cycle cost is
   reduced in comparison with the battery-only configuration. In addition,
   the controllers are also compared along the New European Driving Cycle
   (NEDC), which represents another normalized driving cycle. The results
   show that the RBC, MPC, and FLC achieve a similar performance, and they
   reduce about 23\% of the HESS life cycle cost when compared to the
   battery-only configuration. The ABC and FLC are regarded as the best
   choices in practical applications due to their remarkable performance
   and easy implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper develops a Copula-based sampling method for data-driven
   prognostics. The method essentially consists of an offline training
   process and an online prediction process: (i) the offline training
   process builds a statistical relationship between the failure time and
   the time realizations at specified degradation levels on the basis of
   off-line training data sets; and (ii) the online prediction process
   identifies probable failure times for online testing units based on the
   statistical model constructed in the offline process and the online
   testing data. Our contributions in this paper are three-fold, namely the
   definition of a generic health index system to quantify the health
   degradation of an engineering system, the construction of a Copula-based
   statistical model to learn the statistical relationship between the
   failure time and the time realizations at specified degradation levels,
   and the development of a simulation-based approach for the prediction of
   remaining useful life (RUL). Two engineering case studies, namely the
   electric cooling fan health prognostics and the 2008 IEEE PHM challenge
   problem, are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {{Well-defined culture conditions are essential for realizing the full
   potential of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in regenerative medicine
   where large numbers of cells are required. Synthetic polymers such as
   poly{[}2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium
   hydroxide] (PMEDSAH), offer multiple advantages over mouse embryonic
   fibroblasts (MEFs) and Matrigel (TM) for hESC culture and expansion.
   However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms by which hESCs
   are propagated on synthetic polymers coatings. Here, the effects of
   PMEDSAH gel architecture on hESC self-renewal were determined. By
   increasing the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) reaction
   time, the thickness of PMEDSAH was increased and its internal hydrogel
   architecture was modified, while maintaining its overall chemical
   structure. A 105 nm thick ATRP PMEDSAH coating showed a significant
   increase in the expansion rate of hESCs. Theoretical calculations
   suggested that 20,000 hESCs cultured on this substrate could be expanded
   up to 4.7 x 10(9) undifferentiated cells in five weeks. In addition,
   hESCs grown on ATRP PMEDSAH coatings retained pluripotency and displayed
   a normal karyotype after long-term culture. These data demonstrate the
   importance of polymer physical properties in hESC expansion. This
   modification of PMEDSAH coatings may be used to obtain large populations
   of hESCs required for many applications in regenerative medicine. (C)

   Parameters obtained by the identification are applied to the joint SOC
   estimation method to estimate the SOC of the battery. An experimental

   Several drive cycle current profiles are scaled down and applied to the

Abstract = {{In this paper, the control of flexible-joint robotic manipulators while
   avoiding actuator saturation is investigated. Several proportional
   derivative controllers are developed, all of which disallow actuator
   saturation by guaranteeing that the applied torque is less than a
   specified maximum value. In particular, a Gibbs parameterization of the
   joint angles is included in the control laws, which allows for an
   increased control torque as compared to an Euler angle parameterization.
   An equilibrium point of the closed-loop system is proven to be
   asymptotically stable using the Lyapunov stability analysis. Moreover,
   the proposed control laws do not require any knowledge of the
   manipulator's mass, stiffness, or dissipation properties, and as such,
   are robust to modelling errors. The proposed controllers are tested on a
   single-link flexible-joint manipulator experimentally and on a two-link
   flexible-joint manipulator in simulation, and are compared to the
   performance of controllers found in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Volume = {{267}},
Pages = {{197-202}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Swelling of a commercial 5 Ah lithium-ion cell with a
   nickel/manganese/cobalt-oxide cathode is investigated as a function of
   the charge state and the charge/discharge rate. In combination with
   sensitive displacement measurements, knowledge of the electrode
   configuration within this prismatic cell's interior allows macroscopic
   deformations of the casing to be correlated to electrochemical and
   mechanical transformations in individual anode/separator/cathode layers.
   Thermal expansion and interior charge state are both found to cause
   significant swelling. At low rates, where thermal expansion is
   negligible, the electrode sandwich dilates by as much as 1.5\% as the
   charge state swings from 0\% to 100\% because of lithium-ion
   intercalation. At high rates a comparably large residual swelling was
   observed at the end of discharge. Thermal expansion caused by joule
   heating at high discharge rate results in battery swelling. The changes
   in displacement with respect to capacity at low rate correlate well with
   the potential changes known to accompany phase transitions in the
   electrode materials. Although the potential response changes minimally
   with the C-rate, the extent of swelling varies significantly, suggesting
   that measurements of swelling may provide a sensitive gauge for
   characterizing dynamic operating states. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   touching and not-touching the liquid}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{In the use of atmospheric pressure plasma jets in biological
   applications, the plasma-produced charged and neutral species in the
   plume of the jet often interact with a thin layer of liquid covering the
   tissue being treated. The plasma-produced reactivity must then penetrate
   through the liquid layer to reach the tissue. In this computational
   investigation, a plasma jet created by a single discharge pulse at three
   different voltages was directed onto a 200 mu m water layer covering
   tissue followed by a 10 s afterglow. The magnitude of the voltage and
   its pulse length determined if the ionization wave producing the plasma
   plume reached the surface of the liquid. When the ionization wave
   touches the surface, significantly more charged species were created in
   the water layer with H3O+ (aq), O-3(-) (aq), and O-2(-) (aq) being the
   dominant terminal species. More aqueous OHaq, H2O2aq, and O-3aq were
   also formed when the plasma plume touches the surface. The single pulse
   examined here corresponds to a low repetition rate plasma jet where
   reactive species would be blown out of the volume between pulses and
   there is not recirculation of flow or turbulence. For these conditions,
   NxOy species do not accumulate in the volume. As a result, aqueous
   nitrites, nitrates, and peroxynitrite, and the HNO3aq and HOONOaq, which
   trace their origin to solvated NxOy, have low densities.}},

   Information obtained from x-ray diffraction experiments is compared to
   x-ray diffraction data generated using atomic-scale simulations. The
   proposed methodology, which can be applied to a wide range of
   crystalline materials, is used to study the amorphization process in
   irradiated SiC. Results show that this process can be divided into two
   steps. In the first step, point defects and small defect clusters are
   produced and generate both large lattice swelling and high elastic
   energy. In the second step, enhanced coalescence of defects and defect
   clusters occurs to limit this increase in energy, which rapidly leads to
   complete amorphization.}},

Abstract = {{We implement microfabricated boomerang particles with unequal arm
   lengths as a model for nonsymmetric particles and study their Brownian
   motion in a quasi-two-dimensional geometry by using high-precision
   single-particle motion tracking. We show that because of the coupling
   between translation and rotation, the mean squared displacements of a
   single asymmetric boomerang particle exhibit a nonlinear crossover from
   short-time faster to long-time slower diffusion, and the mean
   displacements for fixed initial orientation are nonzero and saturate out
   at long times. The measured anisotropic diffusion coefficients versus
   the tracking point position indicate that there exists one unique point,
   i.e., the center of hydrodynamic stress (CoH), at which all coupled
   diffusion coefficients vanish. This implies that in contrast to motion
   in three dimensions where the CoH exists only for high-symmetry
   particles, the CoH always exists for Brownian motion in two dimensions.
   We develop an analytical model based on Langevin theory to explain the
   experimental results and show that among the six anisotropic diffusion
   coefficients only five are independent because the
   translation-translation coupling originates from the
   translation-rotation coupling. Finally, we classify the behavior of
   two-dimensional Brownian motion of arbitrarily shaped particles into
   four groups based on the particle shape symmetry group and discussed
   potential applications of the CoH in simplifying understanding of the
   circular motions of microswimmers.}},

   Organic Phosphors via Compositional Variations in
   Bromobenzaldehyde/Dibromobenzene Mixed Crystals}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Spurred by several recent discoveries and a broad and largely unexplored
   design space, purely organic phosphorescent materials are starting to
   garner interest for potential applications in organic optoelectronics
   and sensors. One particularly promising class of purely organic phosphor
   is the family consisting of bromobenzaldehyde emitters doped into
   crystals of dibromobenzene hosts. These stand out by featuring bright,
   robust, and color-tunable room temperature phosphorescence. However,
   despite these attractive qualities, the mixed crystal motif defining
   these materials puts complex demands on crystal packing, chemical
   structure, and sample preparation in ways that are not yet well
   understood. Here we report a detailed study on these materials to
   optimize emission efficiency and fine-tune color. Overall, data suggest
   that achieving efficient inclusion of the emitter into the host crystal
   is critical to optimizing quantum efficiency. Phosphorescent emission
   from the mixed crystals is polarized, indicating that bromobenzaldehyde
   guest is ordered in the dibromobenzene host crystal. While host
   compounds tolerate a surprising variety of emitter sizes, both oversized
   and undersized, maximum quantum efficiency is reached when emitters and
   hosts are identically sized and the former is present at 110 wt \% of
   total solids. The optimum quantum efficiency for these systems appears,
   empirically, to be in the range of 4555\%. To fine-tune emission color,
   altering the halogen substitution of the emitter molecule affords
   sequential 530 nm changes to emission maxima within the green region.
   The relatively minor impact these alterations have on the overall
   chemical structure affords color tuning with minimal detriment to mixing
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The high theoretical gravimetric capacity of the Li-S battery system
   makes it an attractive candidate for numerous energy storage
   applications. In practice, cell performance is plagued by low practical
   capacity and poor cycling. In an effort to explore the mechanism of the
   discharge with the goal of better understanding performance, we examine
   the Li-S phase diagram using computational techniques and complement
   this with an in situ Li-7 NMR study of the cell during discharge. Both
   the computational and experimental studies are consistent with the
   suggestion that the only solid product formed in the cell is Li2S,
   formed soon after cell discharge is initiated. In situ NMR spectroscopy
   also allows the direct observation of soluble Li+-species during cell
   discharge; species that are known to be highly detrimental to capacity
   retention. We suggest that during the first discharge plateau, S is
   reduced to soluble polysulfide species concurrently with the formation
   of a solid component (Li2S) which forms near the beginning of the first
   plateau, in the cell configuration studied here. The NMR data suggest
   that the second plateau is defined by the reduction of the residual
   soluble species to solid product (Li2S). A ternary diagram is presented
   to rationalize the phases observed with NMR during the discharge pathway
   and provide thermodynamic underpinnings for the shape of the discharge
   profile as a function of cell composition.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term storage of desiccated nucleated mammalian cells at ambient
   temperature may be accomplished in a stable glassy state, which can be
   achieved by removal of water from the biological sample in the presence
   of glass-forming agents including trehalose. The stability of the glass
   may be compromised due to a nonuniform distribution of residual water
   and trehalose within and around the desiccated cells. Thus,
   quantification of water and trehalose contents at the single-cell level
   is critical for predicting the glass formation and stability for dry
   storage. Using Raman microspectroscopy, we estimated the trehalose and
   residual water contents in the microenvironment of spin-dried cells.
   Individual cells with or without intracellular trehalose were embedded
   in a solid thin layer of extracellular trehalose after spin-drying. We
   found strong evidence suggesting that the residual water was bound at a
   2:1 water/trehalose molar ratio in both the extracellular and
   intracellular milieus. Other than the water associated with trehalose,
   we did not find any more residual water in the spin-dried sample, intra-
   or extracellularly. The extracellular trehalose film exhibited
   characteristics of an amorphous state with a glass transition
   temperature of similar to 22 degrees C. The intracellular milieu also
   dried to levels suitable for glass formation at room temperature. These
   findings demonstrate a method for quantification of water and trehalose
   in desiccated specimens using confocal Raman microspectroscopy. This
   approach has broad use in desiccation studies to carefully investigate
   the relationship of water and trehalose content and distribution with
   the tolerance to drying in mammalian cells.}},

Abstract = {{Iron sulfide minerals produced during in situ bioremediation of U can
   serve as an oxygen scavenger to retard uraninite (UO2) oxidation upon
   oxygen intrusion. Under persistent oxygen supply, however, iron sulfides
   become oxidized and depleted, giving rise to elevated dissolved oxygen
   (DO) levels and remobilization of U(IV). The present study investigated
   the mechanism that regulates UO2 oxidative dissolution rate in a
   flow-through system when oxygen breakthrough occurred as a function of
   mackinawite (FeS) and carbonate concentrations. The formation and
   evolution of surface layers on UO2 were characterized using XAS and XPS.
   During FeS inhibition period, the continuous supply of carbonate and
   calcium in the influent effectively complexed and removed oxidized U(VI)
   to preserve an intermediate U4O9 surface. When the FeS became depleted
   by oxidization, a transient, rapid dissolution of UO2 was observed along
   with DO breakthrough in the reactor. This rate was greater than during
   the preceding FeS inhibition period and control experiments in the
   absence of FeS. With increasing DO, the rate slowed and the
   rate-limiting step shifted from surface oxidation to U(VI) detachment as
   U(VI) passivation layers developed. In contrast, increasing the
   carbonate concentrations facilitated detachment of surface-associated
   U(VI) complexes and impeded the formation of U(VI) passivation layer.
   This study demonstrates the critical role of U(VI) surface layer
   formation versus U(VI) detachment in controlling UO2 oxidative
   dissolution rate during periods of variable oxygen presence under
   simulated groundwater conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) is extensively studied for its attractive
   properties in dielectric films, anti-reflection coatings, and resistive
   switching memory. Although various crystalline structures of tantalum
   pentoxide have been reported, its structural, electronic, and optical
   properties still remain a subject of research. We investigate the
   electronic and optical properties of crystalline and amorphous Ta2O5
   structures using first-principles calculations based on density
   functional theory and the GW method. The calculated band gaps of the
   crystalline structures are too small to explain the experimental
   measurements, but the amorphous structure exhibits a strong exciton
   binding energy and an optical band gap (similar to 4 eV) in agreement
   with experiment. We determine the atomic orbitals that constitute the
   conduction band for each polymorph and analyze the dependence of the
   band gap on the atomic geometry. Our results establish the connection
   between the underlying structure and the electronic and optical
   properties of Ta2O5. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Ordered horizontal Sb2Te3 nanowires induced by femtosecond lasers}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Nanowires are of intense interest on account of their ability to confine
   electronic and phononic excitations in narrow channels, leading to
   unique vibronic and optoelectronic properties. Most systems reported to
   date exhibit nanowire axes perpendicular to the substrate surface, while
   for many applications (e.g., photodetectors and sensors), a parallel
   orientation may be advantageous. Here, we report the formation of
   in-plane Sb2Te3 nanowires using femtosecond laser irradiation.
   High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging and
   element mapping reveal that an interesting laser-driven anion exchange
   mechanism is responsible for the nanowire formation. This development
   points the way to the scalable production of a distinct class of
   nanowire materials with in-plane geometry. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   presented to realize a tunable composite right-/left-handed

   series-tunable capacitance of the composite right-/left-handed circuit
   model. A long slot is inserted to isolate DC bias, and the chip
   capacitors are mounted on the long slot to create a path for RF signal
   flow. Based on the tunable capacitor-loaded slotted substrate-integrated
   waveguide structure, an electronically controlled composite
   right-/left-handed leaky-wave antenna is designed. It is experimentally
   demonstrated that the direction of the main beam is continuously varied

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{122-132}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The study of a planing flat plate may be considered as a topic of wide
   interest for academic and industrial applications. From experimental and
   numerical studies, flow separation occurs near the stagnation point and
   a thin jet sprays forward along the plate, while a clear wave pattern
   develops downstream. In the present study, the effect on the jet-root
   position caused by a cushion pressure applied on the downstream free
   surface is considered and the consequent variation in lift and drag
   coefficients is studied. This canonical problem is important in the
   design of Surface Effects Ships (SES), the bow seal of which may be
   assumed as a planing deformable surface with a cushion pressure behind
   it. This study focuses on the hydrodynamic interaction between the plate
   and the cushion pressure; as such, the plate geometry is prescribed. A
   two-dimensional numerical study of this problem has been performed in
   the present work using a finite-volume Chimera-overlapping-grids
   approach to numerically solve the Navier-Stokes equations; the free
   surface is handled by means of two-phase level-set method. Validity of
   the results is assessed by the comparison with theoretical and numerical
   results available in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   that the Sb incorporation is suppressed as the substrate temperature

   at all temperatures. We examine the data with a kinetic model, which
   gives insights into the composition of mixed anion alloys using
   straightforward rate equations for each process that occurs during
   growth. It was shown that the reduction in Sb composition is due to the
   preferential removal of Bi by As, and that removal rate obeys an
   Arrhenius dependence with an activation energy of 1.35 eV. Published by

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{33-39}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes the theoretical model and experimental
   investigations of a broadband piezoelectric based vibration energy
   harvester with a triple-well potential induced by a magnetic field. The
   mathematical model is derived from the energy method to describe the
   response characteristics of nonlinear tristable energy generators. The
   parameters of the linear energy harvesting system without magnetic force
   actuation are obtained through intelligent optimization of the minimum
   error between numerical simulations and experimental responses. The
   equivalent nonlinear restoring force of the tristable oscillator is
   experimentally identified as a high order polynomial. Numerical
   simulations and experiments are performed at different harmonic
   excitation levels ranging from 1 to 20 Hz. The results verify that the
   identified electromechanical model can describe the dynamic
   characteristics of broadband tristable energy harvesters. Furthermore,
   in comparison to bistable nonlinear energy oscillators with deeper
   potential well, the tristable arrangement passes easily through
   potential wells for generating higher energy output over a wider range
   of frequency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable collagen scaffolds are used clinically for oral soft
   tissue augmentation to support wound healing. This study sought to
   provide a novel ex vivo model for analyzing healing kinetics and gene
   expression of primary human gingival fibroblasts (hGF) within collagen
   scaffolds. Sponge type and gel type scaffolds with and without
   platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) were assessed in an hGF
   containing matrix. Morphology was evaluated with scanning electron
   microscopy, and hGF metabolic activity using MTT. We quantitated the
   population kinetics within the scaffolds based on cell density and
   distance from the scaffold border of DiI-labled hGFs over a two-week
   observation period. Gene expression was evaluated with gene array and
   qPCR. The sponge type scaffolds showed a porous morphology. Absolute
   cell number and distance was higher in sponge type scaffolds when
   compared to gel type scaffolds, in particular during the first week of
   observation. PDGF incorporated scaffolds increased cell numbers,
   distance, and formazan formation in the MTT assay. Gene expression
   dynamics revealed the induction of key genes associated with the
   generation of oral tissue. DKK1, CYR61, CTGF, TGFBR1 levels were
   increased and integrin ITGA2 levels were decreased in the sponge type
   scaffolds compared to the gel type scaffold. The results suggest that
   this novel model of oral wound healing provides insights into population
   kinetics and gene expression dynamics of biodegradable scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{By coupling techniques of simultaneous secondary (SE) and transmitted
   electron (TE) imaging at high resolution in a modern scanning
   transmission electron microscope (STEM), with the ability to heat
   specimens using a highly stable MEMS-based heating platform, we obtained
   synergistic information to clarify the behavior of catalysts during in
   situ thermal treatments. Au/iron oxide catalyst `leached' to remove
   surface Au was heated to temperatures as high as 700 degrees C. The
   Fe2O3 support particle structure tended to reduce to Fe3O4 and formed
   surface terraces; the formation, coalescence, and mobility of 1- to 2-nm
   particles on the terraces were characterized in SE, STEM-ADF, and TEM-BF
   modes. If combined with simultaneous nanoprobe spectroscopy, this
   approach will open the door to a new way of studying the kinetics of

Abstract = {{We build a united atom model for Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan
   oleates), based on the GROMOS53A6(OXY+D) force field, and apply it to
   two stereoisomers, three constitutional isomers, and three structures
   with one, two, and three tails, to represent components in the Tween 80
   commercial mixture. In a preassembled micelle containing 60 molecules,
   the distribution of Tween tail and ethylene oxide head groups is found
   to be insensitive to stereoisomerization but sensitive to changes in
   relative lengths of the four polyoxyethylene head groups. At the
   airwater and oilwater interfaces, the interfacial tension is
   significantly lower for the constitutional isomer with a shorter W
   headgroup, which attaches the tail to the sorbitan ring, and for Tween
   80 isomers with more than one tail group. The results indicate the
   possible scope for improvement in the design of polyoxyethylene sorbitan
   oleates with improved surface tension reduction or better spreading at
   the oilwater interface. We also report surfactant component distribution
   profiles within preassembled micelles and at interfaces that can be used
   for validating coarse-grained surfactant models needed for simulation of
   self-assembly of Tween 80 surfactant mixtures.}},

Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Eigenvector centrality is a common measure of the importance of nodes in
   a network. Here we show that under common conditions the eigenvector
   centrality displays a localization transition that causes most of the
   weight of the centrality to concentrate on a small number of nodes in
   the network. In this regime the measure is no longer useful for
   distinguishing among the remaining nodes and its efficacy as a network
   metric is impaired. As a remedy, we propose an alternative centrality
   measure based on the nonbacktracking matrix, which gives results closely
   similar to the standard eigenvector centrality in dense networks where
   the latter is well behaved but avoids localization and gives useful
   results in regimes where the standard centrality fails.}},

   Although long considered a homogeneous structure in the

   of distinct cell types and anatomical subdomains that contribute
   differentially to both motor and nonmotor features of behavior. Here, we

Abstract = {{Entropy drives the phase behavior of colloids ranging from dense
   suspensions of hard spheres or rods to dilute suspensions of hard
   spheres and depletants. Entropic ordering of anisotropic shapes into
   complex crystals, liquid crystals, and even quasicrystals was
   demonstrated recently in computer simulations and experiments. The
   ordering of shapes appears to arise from the emergence of directional
   entropic forces (DEFs) that align neighboring particles, but these
   forces have been neither rigorously defined nor quantified in generic
   systems. Here, we show quantitatively that shape drives the phase
   behavior of systems of anisotropic particles upon crowding through DEFs.
   We define DEFs in generic systems and compute them for several hard
   particle systems. We show they are on the order of a few times the
   thermal energy (k(B)T) at the onset of ordering, placing DEFs on par
   with traditional depletion, van der Waals, and other intrinsic
   interactions. In experimental systems with these other interactions, we
   provide direct quantitative evidence that entropic effects of shape also
   contribute to self-assembly. We use DEFs to draw a distinction between
   self-assembly and packing behavior. We show that the mechanism that
   generates directional entropic forces is the maximization of entropy by
   optimizing local particle packing. We show that this mechanism occurs in
   a wide class of systems and we treat, in a unified way, the
   entropy-driven phase behavior of arbitrary shapes, incorporating the
   well-known works of Kirkwood, Onsager, and Asakura and Oosawa.}},

   the DDSI instrument. We utilize MCNP to test the method against 44
   pressurized water reactor SFAs from a simulated spent fuel library with
   a wide dynamic range of characteristic parameters such as initial
   enrichment, burnup, and cooling time. Under ideal conditions,

Abstract = {{The microfluidic optomechanical ring resonator (lFOMRR) based on a

   observed with a sensitivity for the surface density change of 1.2
   Hz/(pg/mm(2)), which translates to a detection limit of 83 pg/mm(2).

Abstract = {{Teams of processive molecular motors are critical for intracellular
   transport and organization, yet coordination between motors remains
   poorly understood. Here, we develop a system using protein components to
   generate assemblies of defined spacing and composition inside cells.
   This system is applicable to studying macromolecular complexes in the
   context of cell signaling, motility, and intracellular trafficking. We
   use the system to study the emergent behavior of kinesin motors in
   teams. We find that two kinesin motors in complex act independently (do
   not help or hinder each other) and can alternate their activities. For
   complexes containing a slow kinesin-1 and fast kinesin-3 motor, the slow
   motor dominates motility in vitro but the fast motor can dominate on

Abstract = {{This paper is the initial investigation into a new Lagrangian
   cell-centered hydrodynamic scheme that is motivated by the desire for an
   algorithm that resists mesh imprinting and has reduced complexity. Key
   attributes of the new approach include multidimensional construction,
   the use of flux-corrected transport (FCT) to achieve second order
   accuracy, automatic determination of the mesh motion through vertex
   fluxes, and vorticity control. Toward this end, vorticity preserving
   Lax-Wendroff (VPLW) type schemes for the two-dimensional acoustic
   equations were analyzed and then implemented in a FCT algorithm. Here,
   mesh imprinting takes the form of anisotropic dispersion relationships.
   If the stencil for the LW methods is limited to nine points, four free
   parameters exist. Two parameters were fixed by insisting that no
   spurious vorticity be created. Dispersion analysis was used to
   understand how the remaining two parameters could be chosen to increase
   isotropy. This led to new VPLW schemes that suffer less mesh imprinting
   than the rotated Richtmyer method. A multidimensional, vorticity
   preserving FCT implementation was then sought using the most promising
   VPLW scheme to address the problem of spurious extrema. A well-behaved
   first order scheme and a new flux limiter were devised in the process.
   The flux limiter is unique in that it acts on temporal changes and does
   not place a priori bounds on the solution. Numerical results have
   demonstrated that the vorticity preserving FCT scheme has comparable
   performance to an unsplit MUSCL-H algorithm at high Courant numbers but
   with reduced mesh imprinting and superior symmetry preservation.

   Kills Cells That Express the Multidrug Resistance-linked ABCG2

Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a strategy to kill selectively multidrug-resistant
   cells that express the ABCG2 transporter (also called breast cancer
   resistance protein, or BCRP). The approach is based on specific
   stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by ABCG2 transporters with subtoxic doses
   of curcumin combined with stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by Na+,
   K+-ATPase with subtoxic doses of gramicidin A or ouabain. After 72 h of
   incubation with the drug combinations, the resulting over consumption of
   ATP by both pathways inhibits the efflux activity of ABCG2 transporters,
   leads to depletion of intracellular ATP levels below the viability
   threshold, and kills resistant cells selectively over cells that lack
   ABCG2 transporters. This strategy, which was also tested on a clinically
   relevant human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7/FLV1), exploits
   the overexpression of ABCG2 transporters and induces caspase-dependent
   apoptotic cell death selectively in resistant cells. This work thus
   introduces a novel strategy to exploit collateral sensitivity (CS) with
   a combination of two clinically used compounds that individually do not
   exert CS. Collectively, this work expands the current knowledge on
   ABCG2-mediated CS and provides a potential strategy for discovery of CS
   drugs against drug-resistant cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{Product formation from R + O-2 reactions relevant to low-temperature
   autoignition chemistry was studied for 2,5-dimethylhexane, a
   symmetrically branched octane isomer, at 550 and 650 K using Cl-atom
   initiated oxidation and multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry
   (MPIMS). Interpretation of time- and photon-energy-resolved mass spectra
   led to three specific results important to characterizing the initial
   oxidation steps: (1) quantified isomer-resolved branching ratios for
   HO2+ alkene channels; (2) 2,2,5,5-tetramethyltetrahydrofuran is formed
   in substantial yield from addition of O2 to tertiary
   2,5-dimethylhex-2-yl followed by isomerization of the resulting ROO
   adduct to tertiary hydroperoxyalkyl (QOOH) and exhibits a positive
   dependence on temperature over the range covered leading to a higher
   flux relative to aggregate cyclic ether yield. The higher relative flux
   is explained by a 1,5-hydrogen atom shift reaction that converts the
   initial primary alkyl radical (2,5-dimethylhex-1-yl) to the tertiary
   alkyl radical 2,5-dimethylhex-2-yl, providing an additional source of
   tertiary alkyl radicals. Quantum-chemical and master-equation
   calculations of the unimolecular decomposition of the primary alkyl
   radical reveal that isomerization to the tertiary alkyl radical is the
   most favorable pathway, and is favored over O2-addition at 650 K under
   the conditions herein. The isomerization pathway to tertiary alkyl
   radicals therefore contributes an additional mechanism to
   2,2,5,5-tetramethyltetrahydrofuran formation; (3) carbonyl species
   (acetone, propanal, and methylpropanal) consistent with beta-scission of
   QOOH radicals were formed in significant yield, indicating unimolecular
   QOOH decomposition into carbonyl + alkene + OH.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new 3D culture microtechnology for high throughput
   production of tumor spheroids and validates its utility for screening
   anticancer drugs. Two immiscible polymeric aqueous solutions are used
   and a submicroliter drop of the ``patterning{''} phase containing cells
   is microprinted into a bath of the ``immersion{''} phase. Selecting
   proper formulations of biphasic systems using a panel of biocompatible
   polymers results in the formation of a round drop that confines cells to
   facilitate spontaneous formation of a spheroid without any external
   stimuli. Adapting this approach to robotic tools enables straightforward
   generation and maintenance of spheroids of well-defined size in standard
   microwell plates and biochemical analysis of spheroids in situ, which is
   not possible with existing techniques for spheroid culture. To enable
   high throughput screening, a phase diagram is established to identify
   minimum cell densities within specific volumes of the patterning drop to
   result in a single spheroid. Spheroids show normal growth over long-term
   incubation and dose-dependent decrease in cellular viability when
   treated with drug compounds, but present significant resistance compared
   to monolayer cultures. The unprecedented ease of implementing this
   microtechnology and its robust performance will benefit high throughput
   studies of drug screening against cancer cells with physiologically
   relevant 3D tumor models.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines platelet adhesion on surfaces that combine coatings
   to limit protein adsorption along with ``anti-platelet{''} nitric oxide
   (NO) release. Uncoated and poly-2-methoxyethylacrylate (PMEA) coated,
   gas permeable polypropylene (PP) membranes were placed in a bioreactor
   to separate plasma and gas flows. Nitrogen with 100/500/1000 ppm of NO
   was supplied to the gas side as a proof of concept. On the plasma side,
   platelet rich plasma (PRP, 1 x 108 cell/mL) was recirculated at low
   (60)/high (300) flows (mL/min). After 8 hours, adsorbed platelets on PP
   was quantified via a lactate dehydrogenase assay. Compared to plain PP,
   the PMEA coating alone reduced adsorption by 17.4 +/- 9.2\% and 29.6 +/-
   16.6\% at low and high flow (p < 0.05), respectively. NO was more
   effective at low plasma flow. At 100 and 500 ppm of NO, adsorption fell
   by 37.9 +/- 6.1\% and 100 +/- 4.7\%, (p < 0.001), on plain PP. At high
   flow with 100, 500, and 1000 ppm of NO, adsorption reduced by 17.9 +/-
   17.8\%, 46.4 +/- 23.2\%, and 100 +/- 4.8\%, (p < 0.001), respectively.
   On PMEA-coated PP with only 100 ppm, adsorption fell by 69.7 +/- 6.8 and
   65.6\% +/- 16.9\%, (p < 0.001), at low and high flows respectively.
   Therefore, the combination of an anti-adsorptive coating with NO has
   great potential to reduce platelet adhesion and coagulation at
   biomaterial surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimension (2-D) cursor control
   system by using steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and P300
   signals to control the direction and speed of the cursor, respectively.
   A hybrid stimulus interface is developed, where P300 visual stimuli are
   distributed at the top and bottom edges, representing accelerating and
   decelerating commands, respectively, and SSVEP stimuli, representing
   turning clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively, are located at the
   right and left sides. A classifier built with support vector machine is
   first used to distinguish between the direction and speed control
   commands, and if the classification result is the speed control command,
   a linear classifier is then applied to classify accelerating and
   decelerating commands. A real-time cursor control system is developed
   and tested with eight participants. The experimental results show that
   the cursor control system has satisfactory efficiency and accuracy, and
   the cursor movement is smooth and continuous. More importantly, it can
   work for the users, who are unable to produce event-related
   desynchronization/event-related synchronization (ERD/ERS) well but can
   produce P300 and SSVEP potentials compared to other 2-D cursor control
   systems. The proposed system can be used as a complementary, sometimes
   an alternative, system to the existing 2-D cursor control systems. (C)

   continuous separation of circulating tumor cells}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Inertial microfluidics is an emerging class of technologies developed to
   separate circulating tumor cells (CTCs). However, defining design
   parameters and flow conditions for optimal operation remains
   nondeterministic due to incomplete understanding of the mechanics, which
   has led to challenges in designing efficient systems. Here, we perform a
   parametric study of the inertial focusing effects observed in low aspect
   ratio curvilinear microchannels and utilize the results to demonstrate
   the isolation of CTCs with high purity. First, we systematically vary
   parameters including the channel height, width, and radius of curvature
   over a wide range of flow velocities to analyze its effect on size
   dependent differential focusing and migration behaviors of binary (10 mu
   m and 20 mu m) particles. Second, we use these results to identify
   optimal flow regimes to achieve maximum separation in various channel
   configurations and establish design guidelines to readily provide
   information for developing spiral channels tailored to potentially
   arbitrary flow conditions that yield a desired equilibrium position for
   optimal size based CTC separation. Finally, we describe a fully
   integrated, sheath-less cascaded spiral microfluidic device to
   continuously isolate CTCs. Human breast cancer epithelial cells were
   successfully extracted from leukocytes, achieving 86.76\% recovery,
   97.91\% depletion rate, and sustaining high viability upon collection to
   demonstrate the versatility of the device. Importantly, this device was
   designed without the cumbersome trail-and-error optimization process
   that has hindered the development of designing such inertial
   microfluidic systems. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory of the University of Michigan,
   selectively located surface roughness has been designed successfully to
   suppress vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of a single cylinder by 60\%
   compared to a smooth cylinder. In this paper, suppression of
   flow-induced motions of two cylinders in tandem using surface roughness
   is studied experimentally by varying flow velocity and cylinder
   center-to-center spacing. Two identical rigid cylinders suspended by
   springs with their axes perpendicular to the flow are allowed one degree
   of freedom motion transverse to the flow direction. Surface roughness is
   applied in the form of four roughness strips helically placed around the
   cylinder. Results are compared to smooth cylinders also tested in this
   work. Amplitude ratio A/D, frequency ratio fosc/fn, water, and range of
   synchronization are measured. Regardless of the center-to-center
   cylinder distance, the amplitude response of the upstream smooth
   cylinder is similar to that of an isolated smooth cylinder. The wake
   from the upstream cylinder with roughness is narrower and longer and has
   significant influence on the amplitude of the downstream cylinder. The
   latter is reduced in the initial and upper branches while its range of
   VIV-synchronization is extended. Galloping is suppressed in both
   cylinders. In addition, the amplitude of the upstream rough cylinder and
   its range of synchronization increase with respect to the isolated rough
   cylinder.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations
   (URANS) equations with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model are used to
   simulate the flow and body kinematics of the transverse motion of
   spring-mounted circular cylinder. The flow is in the high-lift TrSL3
   regime of a Reynolds number in the range 35,000< Re< 130,000. Passive
   turbulence control (PTC) in the form of selectively distributed surface
   roughness is used to alter the cylinder flow induced motion (FIM).
   Simulation is performed using a solver based on the open source
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool OpenFOAM, which solves continuum
   mechanics problems with a finite-volume discretization method. Roughness
   parameters of PTC are chosen based on tests conducted in the Marine
   Renewable Energy Lab (MRELab) of the University of Michigan. The
   numerical tool is first tested on smooth cylinder in vortex-induced
   vibration (VIV) and results are compared with available experimental
   measurements and URANS simulations. For the cylinder with PTC cases, the
   sandpaper grit on the cylinder wall is modeled as a rough-wall boundary
   condition. Two sets of cases with different system parameters (spring,
   damping) are simulated and the results are compared with experimental
   data measured in the MRELab. The amplitude ratio curve shows clearly
   three different branches, including the VIV initial and upper branches,
   and a galloping branch. The numerical branches are similar to those
   observed experimentally. Frequency ratio, vortex patterns, transitional
   behavior, and lift are also predicted well for PTC cylinders at such

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an approach to analyze a process workflow for
   the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits in order to
   identify the source(s) of yield loss. Specifically, we address
   computational challenges using Bayesian analysis to isolate key process
   steps affecting the global yield loss of a given workflow. Bayesian
   inference algorithms incur a heavy computational penalty when applied to
   large graphs with repetitions, un-modeled interactions, and reentrants,
   all of which are commonly found in semiconductor manufacturing
   workflows. We are able to improve the performance of the diagnostic
   inference process by ``folding{''} and ``clustering{''} nodes, where
   possible, to simplify the analysis. We also include the effect of
   un-modeled interactions called latent effects by using a memory
   efficient auxiliary relaxation. Finally, we present a method to
   strategically reverse the simplifications, when necessary, so that the
   accuracy of the inference result is not compromised. The analysis
   process is shown to be effective at identifying the root cause of global
   yield discrepancies in a semiconductor manufacturing workflow. We also
   show that auxiliary relaxation improves the convergence properties of
   the inference algorithm and reduces the net uncertainty and noise in the
   final result.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces new methods for evaluating and improving

   Network connectivity is evaluated using a centrality measure that
   quantifies sensitivity of the size of the largest connected component to
   node removals. Based on this centrality measure, a new method for
   improving resilience is introduced, called edge rewiring. The topology
   of the power grid of western U.S. states is used to illustrate the
   proposed method. Using the proposed centrality measure, we show that the
   power grid topology is especially vulnerable to nodal attacks. In
   particular, using the proposed centrality measure, an attacker could
   reduce the largest component size by nearly a factor of two by only
   targeting 0.2 percent of the nodes. More importantly, we show that
   network resilience can be greatly improved via a few edge rewires
   without introducing additional edges in the network.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient approach for safe landing trajectory
   generation of an airplane with structural damage to its wing flying in
   proximity to local terrain. A damaged airplane maneuvering flight
   envelope is estimated by analyzing the local stability and flying
   quality at each trim condition. Trim state distance to a flight envelope
   boundary provides a novel criterion defined as the safety value index to
   prioritize choice of trim conditions for postdamage flight. A library of
   trajectory segments including trim states and transition maneuvers
   between trim conditions in the local neighborhood are generated using a
   linear quadratic regulator controller. A potential field strategy is
   used to rapidly define emergency landing trajectories composed as trim
   state sequences based on criteria including terrain avoidance, safety
   value index, and safe landing requirements such as touchdown heading and
   position, airspeed, glide slope, and bank angle. Cost criteria are
   balanced by adjusting weights. Landing scenarios are presented to
   demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to autonomously plan
   safe landing trajectories.}},

Title = {{Minimum-Fuel Ascent of a Hypersonic Vehicle Using Surrogate Optimization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1973-1986}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{A general strategy is identified to compute the minimum fuel required
   for the ascent of a generic hypersonic vehicle that is propelled by a
   dual-mode ramjet-scramjet engine with hydrogen fuel. The study addresses
   the ascent of an accelerator vehicle rather than a high-speed cruiser.
   Two general types of ascent trajectories are considered: acceleration
   within scramjet mode, and acceleration across the ramjet-scramjet
   transition boundary maximum acceleration and maximum dynamic pressure
   (lowest allowed altitude) were shown to be near optimum for
   scramjet-mode trajectories, but optimized trajectories were found to be
   more complex when both modes are considered. The first-principles model
   used in this paper computes the combustion efficiency using finite-rate
   chemistry and a fuel-air mixing model. It also computes the inlet
   efficiency with a shock wave interaction code, and thus avoids empirical
   formulas for efficiency that were used in previous models.}},

Title = {{Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization of a Planing Craft with
   Uncertainty}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SHIP PRODUCTION AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{194-200}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Uncertainty exists in many of the design variables and system parameters
   for planing craft. This is especially true in the early stages of
   design. For this reason, and others, optimization of a craft's
   performance characteristics is often delayed until later in the design
   process, after uncertainties have been at least partially resolved.
   However, delaying optimization can also limit its potential, because
   freedom to make changes to a design is also highly limited in the later
   stages. This article demonstrates how uncertainty can be directly
   incorporated into optimization using particle swarm. A simple synthesis
   model for a planing craft is built, and a deterministic Pareto front of
   optimal solutions is found, minimizing two objectives: drag and vertical
   acceleration at the center of gravity. The craft's weight is then
   modeled as a normally distributed random variable and sampling methods
   are used to quantify the uncertainty in the estimated drag for points
   along the Pareto front. Preliminary results reveal that drag uncertainty
   is not constant along the Pareto front, presenting useful tradeoff
   information for designers and decision-makers.}},

Abstract = {{Hospitals typically lack effective enterprise level strategic planning
   of bed and care resources, contributing to bed census levels that are
   statistically ``out of control.{''} This system dysfunction manifests
   itself in bed block, surgical cancelation, ambulance diversions, and
   operational chaos. This is the classic hospital admission scheduling and
   control (HASC) problem, which has been addressed in its entirety only
   through inexact simulation-based search heuristics. This paper develops
   new analytical models of controlled hospital census that can, for the
   first time, be incorporated into a mixed-integer programming model to
   optimally solve the strategic planning/scheduling portion of the HASC.
   Our new solution method coordinates elective admissions with other
   hospital subsystems to reduce system congestion. We formulate a new
   Poisson-arrival-location model (PALM) based on an innovative stochastic
   location process that we developed and call the patient temporal
   resource needs model. We further extend the PALM approach to the class
   of deterministic controlled-arrival-location models (d-CALM) and develop
   linearizing approximations to stochastic blocking metrics. This work
   provides the theoretical foundations for an efficient scheduled
   admissions planning system as well as a practical decision support
   methodology to stabilize hospital census.}},

Abstract = {{Recapitulating the native environment of bone tissue is essential to
   develop in vitro models of breast cancer bone metastasis. The bone is a
   composite material consisting of organic matrix and inorganic mineral
   phase, primarily hydroxyapatite. In this study, we report the
   mineralization of porous poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) scaffolds upon
   incubation in modified Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) for 14 days.
   Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and
   X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the deposited minerals have
   composition similar to hydroxyapatite. The study demonstrated that the
   rate of nucleation and growth of minerals was faster on surfaces of less
   porous scaffolds. However, upon prolonged incubation, formation of
   mineral layer was observed on the surface of all the scaffolds. In
   addition, the study also demonstrated that 3D mineralization only
   occurred for scaffolds with highly interconnected porous networks. The
   mineralization of the scaffolds promoted the adsorption of serum
   proteins and consequently, the adhesion and proliferation of breast
   cancer cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the rolling stability of a power-generating tumbleweed
   rover is investigated. The nonlinear equations of motion of the rover
   capture the nonholonomic nature of rolling without slipping, the
   external wind force, and energy dissipation due to rolling friction and
   power generation. To assess stability of the system as it rolls about a
   preferred axis of rotation, Lyapunov's indirect method is employed. When
   the shell of the tumbleweed rover has a uniform mass distribution,
   Lyapunov's indirect method predicts instability; when the inertia about
   a preferred axis of rotation is increased, Lyapunov's indirect method
   predicts stability. Numerical simulation results of both the linearized
   and nonlinear equations of motion confirm both the instability and
   stability predictions of Lyapunov's indirect method.}},

Abstract = {{Spray-applied fire-resistive material (SFRM) is one of the most commonly

   investigates the feasibility of developing a new version of

   ECC family of materials and the excellent insulation property of SFRM.
   The study shows that ECC with similar or even better insulation property

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an ultrasonic detector with unprecedented broad bandwidth

   It has an acoustic response of up to 350 MHz at -3 dB and noise-limited

   Application of such a detector in photoacoustic imaging leads to
   improved axial resolving ability compared with using the conventional
   ultrasound detector, and sub-3 mu m axial resolution is achieved, which
   is more than a 2-fold improvement with respect to the reported record.
   The device's miniaturized cavity height guarantees its broadband
   response, and at the same time, its high optical quality factor ensures
   the detection sensitivity. Our work suggests that the polymer-based
   miniature microring resonator works as a high-performance ultrasound

Abstract = {{This work presents the results of an experimental and computational
   study of methyl trans-3-hexenoate autoignition. Experimental
   autoignition studies were conducted using the University of Michigan
   rapid compression facility. Pressure time histories were used to
   determine ignition delay times as a function of test gas composition and
   experimental conditions. The fuel/oxygen equivalence ratio and dilution
   level were phi = 0.3 and inert/O-2 = 3.76 (mole basis). End of
   compression conditions targeted an average pressure of 10.5 atm and
   temperatures ranging from 884 to 1085 K. A correlation in Arrhenius form
   was developed by regression analysis of the experimental data, where the
   ignition delay time is tau(ign) (ms) = 1.4 x 10(6) exp{[}30 100/((R)
   over bar T-(cal mol1 K1))] with a R-2 value of 0.99. Gas-sampling
   experiments were also conducted to measure stable intermediates formed
   during autoignition. A detailed reaction mechanism was developed and
   model predictions were compared to the experimental data. While ignition
   delay time predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimental
   data, the speciation results highlight uncertainties in the reaction
   chemistry of unsaturated esters and small hydrocarbon intermediates.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the speed control of a spark ignition engine during vehicle
   deceleration. When the torque converter bypass clutch is open, the
   engine speed needs to be kept close to the turbine speed to guarantee
   responsiveness of the vehicle for subsequent accelerations. However, to
   maintain vehicle drivability, undesired crossing between engine speed
   and turbine speed must not occur, despite the presence of significant
   torque disturbances. Hence, the engine speed during vehicle
   decelerations needs to be precisely controlled by feedback control,
   which has to coordinate airflow and spark timing and enforce several
   constraints including engine stall avoidance, combustion stability, and
   actuator limits. We develop a model predictive controller that
   manipulates airflow and spark to track the reference signal for engine
   speed while enforcing constraints, and synthesize it in the form of a
   feedback law. The controller is evaluated in simulations and in a
   vehicle, and it is shown to achieve a responsive and consistent
   deceleration and the potential for reducing fuel consumption.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of temperature inside a battery cell requires accurate
   information about the cooling conditions even when the battery surface
   temperature is measured. This paper presents a model-based approach for
   estimating temperature distribution inside a cylindrical battery under
   unknown convective cooling conditions. A reduced-order thermal model
   using a polynomial approximation of the temperature profile inside the
   battery is used. A dual Kalman filter (DKF), a combination of a Kalman
   filter and an extended Kalman filter, is then applied for the
   identification of the convection coefficient and the estimation of the
   battery core temperature. The thermal properties are modeled by volume
   averaged lumped-values under the assumption of a homogeneous and
   isotropic volume. The model is parameterized and validated using
   experimental data from a 2.3 Ah 26 650 lithium-iron-phosphate battery
   cell with a forced-air convective cooling during hybrid electric vehicle
   drive cycles. Experimental results show that the proposed DKF-based
   estimation method can provide an accurate prediction of the core
   temperature under unknown cooling conditions by measuring battery
   current and voltage along with surface and ambient temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{One of the challenging issues in wireless LANs (WLANs) is improving the
   network throughput. One of the possible solutions for the issue is
   maximizing the number of concurrent transmissions. Although some
   protocols have been proposed to exploit transmission concurrency in
   WLANs, their performance depends on the degree of the interference among
   links. Also, it is hard to obtain interference information because of
   their dynamics. In this paper, we propose an enhanced medium access
   control (MAC) protocol for WLANs, named multichannel relay MAC (MRMAC),
   which is able to transmit multiple frames simultaneously without
   considering interference. To enable concurrent transmissions, MRMAC
   adopts the concept of frame relaying. Furthermore, MRMAC utilizes
   several nonoverlapping channels to eliminate interferences. Through
   extensive simulations, we found that MRMAC shows better performance than
   existing well-known MAC protocols. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \&

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The authors present a study on transfer characteristics of plasma-doped
   MoS2 transistors with various MoS2 thicknesses and those acquired under
   different air humidity conditions. The MoS2 thickness-dependent
   characterization implies that plasma-assisted doping processes induce
   p-doping to multilayer MoS2 channels through a
   surface-charge-transferlike mechanism and the effective space-charge
   layer thickness is estimated to be similar to 22 nm. The
   humidity-dependent characterization shows that plasma-doped MoS2
   transistors exhibit a much more prominent dependence of the transfer
   characteristics on humidity in comparison with pristine MoS2-based
   transistors. This is attributed to the plasma-induced dangling bonds or
   absorbate centers on MoS2 surfaces, which can enhance the absorption of
   water molecules and result in additional p-doping to MoS2 transistors.
   This work advances the understanding of the effects of plasma doping
   processes on the electronic properties of MoS2 and provides important
   technical insights for making MoS2-based gas and chemical sensors. (C)

Abstract = {{Hard x-rays from laser-produced hot electrons (>10 keV) in backlit
   pinhole imagers can give rise to a background signal that decreases
   signal dynamic range in radiographs. Consequently, significant
   uncertainties are introduced to the measured optical depth of imaged
   plasmas. Past experiments have demonstrated that hard x-rays are
   produced when hot electrons interact with the high-Z pinhole substrate
   used to collimate the softer He-a x-ray source. Results are presented
   from recent experiments performed on the OMEGA-60 laser to further study
   the production of hard x-rays in the pinhole substrate and how these
   x-rays contribute to the background signal in radiographs. Radiographic
   image plates measured hard x-rays from pinhole imagers with Mo, Sn, and
   Ta pinhole substrates. The variation in background signal between
   pinhole substrates provides evidence that much of this background comes
   from x-rays produced in the pinhole substrate itself. A Monte Carlo
   electron transport code was used to model x-ray production from hot
   electrons interacting in the pinhole substrate, as well as to model
   measurements of x-rays from the irradiated side of the targets, recorded
   by a bremsstrahlung x-ray spectrometer. Inconsistencies in inferred hot
   electron distributions between the different pinhole substrate materials
   demonstrate that additional sources of hot electrons beyond those
   modeled may produce hard x-rays in the pinhole substrate. (C) 2014 AIP

   mechanism of the in situ hydrogel is thoroughly investigated. This novel

Pages = {{7-15}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Reactions with aqueous sulfide are important in determining uranium (U)
   geochemistry under sulfate reducing conditions. This paper reports on
   abiotic reduction of U(VI) by aqueous sulfide under a range of
   experimental conditions using batch reactors. Dissolved U concentration
   was measured as a function of time to study the effects of chemical
   variables including pH, U(VI), S(-II), total dissolved carbonate (CARB =
   H2CO3{*} + HCO3 + CO32 ), and Ca2+ concentration on the U(VI) reduction
   rate. Solid phase reaction products were characterized using X-ray
   diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and transmission electron
   microscopy. The chemical variables had impacts on the solid phase U(VI)
   reaction products as well as the reduction rates by aqueous sulfide. The
   solid U reaction product at circumneutral pH was identified as uraninite
   (UO2+x(s)). Under basic pH conditions, whether a precipitate occurred
   depended on Ca2+ and CARB concentrations. U(VI) reduction was faster
   under higher S(-II) concentrations but was slowed by increased dissolved
   Ca2+ or CARB concentration. In the absence of dissolved CARB and Ca2+, a
   rapid decrease in dissolved U concentration occurred at circumneutral
   pH, while virtually no decrease was observed at pH 10.7 within the
   experimental timeframe of two days. The U(VI) reduction rate was
   proportional to the total concentration of free uranyl plus its
   hydrolysis complexes even at minor to trace concentrations. Dissolved
   Ca2+ and CARB slow abiotic U(VI) reduction by forming stable
   Ca-U(VI)-carbonato soluble complexes that are resistant to reaction with
   aqueous sulfide. U(VI) reduction was slow in a synthetic solution
   representative of groundwater at a uranium mill tailings site. This
   study illustrates that abiotic U reduction by aqueous sulfide can
   significantly vary under typical ranges of chemical conditions in
   groundwater and newly demonstrates the importance of dissolved Ca2+ in
   the abiotic U(VI) reduction by aqueous sulfide. The results contribute
   to our understanding of the impact of sulfate reducing conditions on U
   speciation in groundwater systems undergoing bioreduction conversion of
   U(VI) to less mobile U(IV) solid phases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective: Vascular-targeting remains a promising strategy for improving
   the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) by
   providing localized delivery of imaging and therapeutic agents to
   atherosclerotic lesions. In this work we evaluate how size and shape
   affects the capacity for a vascular-targeted carrier system to bind
   inflamed endothelial cells over plaque using ApoE -/- mice with
   developed atherosclerosis.
   Method: We investigated the adhesion levels along mouse aortae of
   ellipsoidal and spherical particles targeted to the inflammatory
   molecules E-selectin and VCAM-1, as well as the biodistribution of
   targeted and untargeted particles in major organs following injection
   via tail-vein and a 30-min circulation time.
   Results: We found that targeted ellipsoidal microparticles adhered to
   mouse aortae at higher levels than microspheres of similar volume,
   particularly at segments that contained atherosclerotic plaques.
   Moreover, both ellipsoidal and spherical nanoparticles displayed the
   same minimal adhesion levels compared to both types of microparticles
   evaluated, likely due to poor localization of nanoparticles to the
   vessel wall in blood flow. We found that microparticles targeted to
   plaque-associated inflammation were retained at higher levels in the
   lungs than untargeted particles, largely due to molecular interaction
   with the pulmonary endothelium. The level of the mechanical entrapment
   of ellipsoidal microparticles in the lungs was also not significantly
   different from that of microspheres of the same volume despite a similar
   to 3-fold higher major axis length for the ellipsoids.
   Conclusions: Particle shape and size should be considered in the design
   of carrier systems to target atherosclerosis, as these parameters can be
   tuned to improve carrier performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We fabricated ultra-high aspect ratio silicon nanomaterials, including a
   silicon nanomesh and silicon nanowire array, on a wafer scale for
   efficient photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. These silicon
   nanomaterials (feature size approximate to 20 nm) possess a high aspect
   ratio to increase the optical absorptivity of the cells to approximately
   95\% over a broad range of wavelengths. The silicon nanomesh and Si
   nanowire cells achieved high photocurrent values of 13 and 28 mAcm(-2),
   respectively, which are increased by 200\% and 570\% in comparison to
   their bulk counterparts. In addition, these scalable Si nanomaterials
   remained stable for up to 100 min of hydrogen evolution. Detailed
   studies on the doping and geometrical structures of the resulting
   hydrogen evolution cells suggest that both the n(+) pp(+) doping and
   thickness of nanostructures are keys to the enhancement of the hydrogen
   evolution efficiency. The results obtained in this work show that these

Abstract = {{This letter considers a compute-and-forward two-way relaying channel

   optimization problem is formulated to minimize the transmit power P-r of
   relay, while guaranteeing the minimal transmission rate at each

Abstract = {{Elastic wave velocities in metallic structures are affected by
   variations in environmental conditions such as changing temperature.
   This paper extends the theory of acoustoelasticity by allowing thermally
   induced strains in unconstrained isotropic media, and it experimentally
   examines the velocity variation of Lamb waves in aluminum plates
   (AL-6061) due to isothermal temperature deviations. This paper presents
   both thermally induced acoustoelastic constants and thermally varying
   effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio which include the third
   order elastic material constants. The experimental thermal sensitivity
   of the phase velocity (partial derivative upsilon(P)/partial derivative
   theta) for both the symmetric and antisymmetric modes are bounded by two
   theories, the acoustoelastic Lamb wave theory with thermo-acoustoelastic
   tensors and the thermoelastic Lamb wave theory using an effective
   thermo-acoustoelastic moduli. This paper shows the theoretical thermally
   induced acoustoelastic Lamb wave thermal sensitivity(partial derivative
   upsilon(P)/partial derivative theta) is an upper bound approximation of
   the experimental thermal changes, but the acoustoelastic Lamb wave
   theory is not valid for predicting the antisymmetric (A0) phase velocity
   at low frequency-thickness values, <1.55 MHz mm for various
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid-feed flame spray pyrolysis (LF-FSP) provides atomically
   homogeneous mixed metal powders with 30-40nm average particle sizes,
   often producing kinetic phases due to the high quench rate As produced
   LF-FSP Al2O3-rich spinels, such as MgO3Al(2)O(3), form an Al2O3-rich
   metastable single-phase spinel. On heating, the powders phase separate
   to form MAl2O4 and -Al2O3. Compacts of MO3Al(2)O(3) (M=Co, Ni, Mg) were
   produced and sintered to evaluate the final duplex microstructure. The
   same composition was also approached from stoichiometric LF-FSP MAl2O4
   nanopowders ball-milled with Al2O3 nanopowders in an attempt to evaluate
   how the initial length scale of mixing affected the final
   microstructure. Contrary to traditional sintering, we observe two
   distinct mechanisms. At 1000 degrees C-1200 degrees C, cation diffusion
   appears to control densification as a consequence of high vacancy
   concentrations and atomic mixing where traditionally expected site
   inversion plays less of a factor given the high quench rates. The second
   mechanism follows -Al2O3 exsolution and densification occurs via oxygen
   diffusion and -Al2O3 grain growth. When sintering the duplex
   MAl2O4/-Al2O3 compacts to at least 95\% theoretical density, we find
   final microstructures that do not reflect the initial degrees of mixing.
   That is, the atomically mixed MgO3Al(2)O(3) does not does not offer an
   advantage over the submicron length scale of mixing in the ball-milled
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{Stress development and fracture of isolated cristobalite spherulites in
   amorphous silica matrix were observed. High purity bulk silica was
   annealed to produce partial surface crystallization consisting of
   isolated and impinged spherulites in an amorphous matrix. The stress
   state of the amorphous silica surrounding cristobalite spherulites was
   qualitatively examined using crossed-polars microscopy. Fracture was
   observed to occur with many spherulites encircled by cracks in the
   matrix and other spherulites observed to self-fracture in a mud-cracking
   pattern. The fracture was found to be size dependent with encircling
   matrix cracks occurring as a minority phenomena in spherulites 20-70
   microns in diameter and mud-cracking self-fracture to occur in all
   spherulites over 70 microns in diameter. The stresses develop as a
   result of the strain associated with the 4.9\% volume reduction in the
   cristobalite on transitioning from beta-to-alpha phase at similar to 250
   degrees C. Observed fracture behaviors were modeled. Matrix cracks
   encircling spherulites were found to be consistent with a Weibull
   failure model of the glass under a stress field derived from the Eshelby
   inclusion model. Self-fractured spherulite failure was found to be
   consistent with a failure model based on thin films under biaxial

Abstract = {{Molecular junctions hold significant promise for efficient and
   high-power-output thermoelectric energy conversion(1-3). Recent
   experiments have probed the thermoelectric properties of molecular
   junctions(4-7). However, electrostatic control of thermoelectric
   properties via a gate electrode has not been possible due to technical
   challenges in creating temperature differentials in three-terminal
   devices. Here, we show that extremely large temperature gradients
   (exceeding 1 x 10(9) Km(-1)) can be established in nanoscale gaps
   bridged by molecules, while simultaneously controlling their electronic
   structure via a gate electrode. Using this platform, we study
   prototypical Au-biphenyl-4,4'-dithiol-Au and Au-fullerene-Au junctions
   to demonstrate that the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical
   conductance of molecular junctions can be simultaneously increased by
   electrostatic control. Moreover, from our studies of fullerene
   junctions, we show that thermoelectric properties can be significantly
   enhanced when the dominant transport orbital is located close to the
   chemical potential (Fermi level) of the electrodes. These results
   illustrate the intimate relationship between the thermoelectric
   properties and charge transmission characteristics of molecular
   junctions and should enable systematic exploration of the recent
   computational predictions1-3 that promise extremely efficient
   thermoelectric energy conversion in molecular junctions.}},

Journal = {{CRYSTAL GROWTH \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Simulations of CO2 sorption were performed in two members of the highly
   tunable rht-metalorganic framework (MOF) platform: PCN-61 and PCN-66.
   These MOFs differ only in the triisophthalate ligand used to synthesize
   the respective MOFs. In PCN-61, the center of the ligand contains a
   benzene ring; this ring is substituted with a triphenylamine group in
   PCN-66. There are two chemically distinct Cu2+ ions that comprise the
   copper paddlewheels, {[}Cu-2(O2CR)(4)], in all rht-MOFs. One type of
   Cu2+ ion, denoted Cu-1, projects into the truncated tetrahedral (TTd)
   and truncated octahedral (TOh) cages, while the other Cu2+ ion, denoted
   Cu-2, projects into the cuboctahedral (cubO(h)) cages. Electronic
   structure calculations revealed that, in PCN-61, the Cu-2 ions have a
   significantly higher partial positive charge than the Cu1 ions, whereas
   the opposite was observed in PCN-66. The simulations revealed that the
   CO2 molecules sorb initially onto the Cu2+ ions that have the higher
   partial positive charge, i.e., the Cu-2 ions in PCN-61 and the Cu1 ions
   in PCN-66. This was demonstrated by examining the radial distribution
   function, g(r), about both Cu2+ ions and the modeled structure at low
   loading for both MOFs. This study provided insights into how differences
   in the charge distributions about the copper paddlewheels between two
   isostructural MOFs, arising from the choice of functionality on the
   ligand, can lead to different CO2 binding sites at low loading and
   suggests a more general conceptual framework for controlling sorption
   through the tuning of MOF electronics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, stress intensity factor solutions for adhesive-bonded
   lap-shear specimens of magnesium alloy AZ31 and hot-dip-galvanized (HDG)
   mild steel sheets with and without kinked cracks are investigated for
   fatigue life estimations. First, the kinked fatigue crack failure mode
   of the adhesive-bonded lap-shear specimens is briefly reviewed. Then,
   the analytical global J integral and effective stress intensity factor
   solutions for main cracks in lap-shear specimens of three dissimilar
   sheets under plane strain conditions are developed based on the beam
   bending theory. The global effective stress intensity factor solutions
   for the main cracks in the lap-shear specimens from the corresponding
   finite element analyses are then presented and validated by the
   analytical solutions. Next, the local stress intensity factor solutions
   for kinked cracks with the experimentally observed kink angle as
   functions of the kink length from the corresponding finite element
   analyses are presented and the computational solutions are also compared
   with the analytical solutions at small kink lengths. The results
   indicate that the computational local stress intensity factor solutions
   for kinked cracks approach to the analytical solutions as the kink
   length decreases to a small value and the kinked crack is under dominant
   mode I loading conditions. The computational results also indicate that
   the local stress intensity factor solutions at a small kink length of
   microstructural significance may be used as the stress intensity factor
   solutions for zero or near zero kink length for fatigue life estimations
   when the computational results are not available. The computational
   local stress intensity factor solutions are then adopted to estimate the
   fatigue lives of the lap-shear specimens based on a kinked crack growth
   model and available material constants for the Paris law. The fatigue
   life estimations are lower than the experimental results. However, the
   general trend of fatigue life estimations agrees with that of the
   experimental results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine whether a
   computerized algorithm is able to accurately differentiate epicardial vs
   endocardial origins of ventricular arrhythmias.
   METHODS Endocardial and epicardiaL pace-mapping were performed in 43
   patients at 3277 sites. The 12-Lead ECGs were digitized and analyzed
   using a mixture of gaussian model (MoG) to assess whether the algorithm
   was able to identify an epicardial vs endocardial origin of the paced
   rhythm. The MoG computerized algorithm was compared to algorithms
   published in prior reports.
   RESULTS The computerized algorithm correctly differentiated epicardial
   vs endocardial pacing sites for 800/0 of the sites compared to an
   accuracy of 42\% to 66\% of other described criteria. The accuracy was
   higher in patients without structural heart disease than in those with
   structural heart disease (94 /a vs 80\%, P =.0004) and for right bundle
   branch block (82\%) compared to left bundle branch block morphologies
   (79\%, P = .001). Validation studies showed the accuracy for VT exit
   sites to be 84\%.
   CONCLUSION A computerized algorithm was able to accurately differentiate
   the majority of epicardial vs endocardial pacemapping sites. The
   algorithm is not region specific and performed best in patients without
   structural heart disease and with VTs having a right bundle branch block
   morphology.}},

Abstract = {{We present a 346 mu m(2) reference-free, asynchronous VCO-based sensor
   interface circuit demonstrated in 28 nm LP bulk CMOS. This design is
   specifically for sensor node interfaces which do not have the power or
   volume available for the high accuracy current sources, voltage sources,
   or low jitter timing references needed for traditional ADCs. By using a
   straightforward VCO design, it achieves wide resolution, voltage
   scalability, and process portability while consuming only similar to
   1/100th the area of prior approaches and avoiding costly reference
   circuitry. In the design measured for this paper, resolution can be
   scaled from 2.8 to 11.7 bits and V-DD from 500 mV to 1.0 V. The design
   contains a single-point calibration scheme that works across
   temperature, voltage, and resolution settings. Minimum power consumption
   is 11.7 mu W at 0.6 V V-DD and minimum energy per conversion step is
   41.2 fJ/b at 0.6 V V-DD and 9.42 bits of effective resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Checking validity of a model is a crucial step in the process of system
   identification. This is especially true when dealing with switched
   affine systems since, in this case, the problem of system identification
   from noisy data is known to be generically NP-Hard and can only be
   solved in practice by using heuristics and relaxations. Therefore,
   before the identified models can be used for instance for controller
   design, they should be systematically validated against additional
   experimental data. In this paper we address the problem of model (in)
   validation for multi-input multi-output switched affine systems in
   output error form with unknown switches. As a first step, we prove that
   necessary and sufficient invalidation certificates can be obtained by
   solving a sequence of convex optimization problems. In principle, these
   problems involve increasingly large matrices. However, as we show in the
   paper by exploiting recent results from semialgebraic geometry, the
   proposed algorithm is guaranteed to stop after a finite number of steps
   that can be be explicitly computed from the a priori information. In
   addition, this algorithm exploits the sparse structure of the underlying
   optimization problem to substantially reduce the computational burden.
   The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using both
   academic examples and a non-trivial problem arising in computer vision:
   activity monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{One approach to multiobjective optimization is to define a scalar
   substitute objective function that aggregates all objectives and solve
   the resulting aggregate optimization problem (AOP). In this paper, we
   discern that the objective function in quasi-separable multidisciplinary
   design optimization (MDO) problems can be viewed as an aggregate
   objective function (AOF). We consequently show that a method that can
   solve quasi-separable problems can also be used to obtain Pareto points
   of associated AOPs. This is useful when AOPs are too hard to solve or
   when the design engineer does not have access to the models necessary to
   evaluate all the terms of the AOF. In this case, decomposition-based
   design optimization methods can be useful to solve the AOP as a
   quasi-separable MDO problem. Specifically, we use the analytical target
   cascading methodology to formulate decomposed subproblems of
   quasi-separable MDO problems and coordinate their solution in order to
   obtain Pareto points of the associated AOPs. We first illustrate the
   approach using a well-known simple geometric programming example and
   then present a vehicle suspension design problem with three objectives
   related to ground vehicle ride and handling.}},

Abstract = {{Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is the traumatic, degenerative, or surgical
   loss of muscle tissue, which may result in function loss and physical
   deformity. To date, clinical treatments for VML-the reflected muscle
   flap or transferred muscle graft-are limited by tissue availability and
   donor site morbidity. To address the need for more innovative skeletal
   muscle repair options, our laboratory has developed scaffoldless
   tissue-engineered skeletal muscle units (SMUs), multiphasic tissue
   constructs composed of engineered skeletal muscle with engineered
   bone-tendon ends, myotendinous junctions, and entheses, which in vitro
   can produce force both spontaneously and in response to electrical
   stimulation. Though phenotypically immature in vitro, we have shown that
   following 1 week of implantation in an ectopic site, our muscle
   constructs develop vascularization and innervation, an epimysium-like
   outer layer of connective tissue, an increase in myosin protein content,
   formation of myofibers, and increased force production. These findings
   suggest that our engineered muscle tissue survives implantation and
   develops the interfaces necessary to advance the phenotype toward adult
   muscle. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of our
   SMUs to restore muscle tissue to sites of acute VML. Our results
   indicate that our SMUs continue to mature in vivo with longer recovery
   times and have the potential to repair VML sites by providing additional
   muscle fibers to damaged muscles. We conclude from this study that our
   SMUs have the potential to restore lost tissue volume in cases of acute
   VML.}},

Abstract = {{The cryopreservation and autotransplantation of ovarian tissue is
   emerging as a powerful approach for preserving fertility. However, for
   cancer patients, it may not be possible to transplant ovarian tissue due
   to the risk of re-seeding disease. We investigated strategies for
   transplantation of individually isolated follicles to minimize the risk
   of re-introducing cancer cells present within the vasculature of ovarian
   stroma. Procedures for large-scale isolation of early-stage follicles
   and their encapsulation into fibrin hydrogels were developed. For in
   vivo validation studies, mice were ovariectomized and transplanted with
   encapsulated follicles into the ovarian bursa. A substantial increase in
   the number of secondary follicles was observed in the graft at 9 days
   after transplantation, and antral follicles by day 21, demonstrating
   primordial follicle recruitment into the growing pool. Initially,
   elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels declined substantially by
   day 21, indicating feedback from the graft; presence of corpora lutea
   showed the graft's capability of restoring hormone cyclicity. Taken
   together, the transplanted follicles were able to engraft, mature, and
   restore ovarian function in an infertile mouse. This biomaterial may,
   thus, provide a platform for follicle transplantation with a low risk of
   cancer contamination and for developing strategies that preserve
   fertility for women facing a cancer diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by high oil prices, several large fleet companies initiated
   future plans to hybridize their fleets to establish immunity of their
   optimized business models against severe oil price fluctuations, and
   adhere to increasing awareness of environmentally friendly solutions.
   The hybridization projects increased maintenance costs especially for
   costly and degradable components such as Li-ion batteries. This paper
   introduces a degradation-based resource allocation policy to optimally
   utilize batteries on fleet level. The policy, denoted as
   degradation-based swapping optimization, incorporates optimal
   implementation of swapping and substitution actions throughout a plan of
   finite-time horizon to minimize projected maintenance costs. The
   swapping action refers to the interchange in the placement of two
   batteries within a fleet. The substitution action refers to the
   replacement of degraded batteries with new ones. The policy takes
   advantage of the different degradation rates of the state of health of
   the batteries because of different loading conditions, achieving optimal
   placement at different time intervals throughout the plan horizon. A
   mathematical model for the policy is provided. The optimization of the
   generated model is studied through several algorithms. Numerical results
   for sample problems are obtained to illustrate the capability of the
   proposed policy in establishing substantial savings in the projected
   maintenance costs compared to other policies.}},

   In the past decade, rapid advances in microengineering have enabled an

   miniaturized blood cell assay platforms also provide the attractive
   capabilities of reducing chemical consumption, cost, and assay time, as

Volume = {{81}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the implementation of a low noise, high dynamic-range
   I I{''} pound readout for low cost capacitive Micro-Electro-Mechanical
   Systems (MEMS) accelerometers. The readout circuit sets the bandwidth of
   the I I{''} pound loop through an extra feedback path, and hence allows
   the closed loop system to operate with the low noise characteristics
   similar to a second-order I I{''} pound analog-to-digital converter. A
   thorough noise analysis of the proposed accelerometer shows that the
   mechanical noise is the most significant source and quantization noise
   is mostly eliminated. Dynamic range (DR) of the system is improved by
   minimizing the circuit noise and increasing the full scale range (FSR)
   by high-voltage pulse feedback. Utilization of these techniques allows
   the implementation of low cost, low noise, and high DR navigation-grade
   accelerometers, by eliminating the need for large proof mass, large area
   MEMS sensors. The proposed system can achieve a minimum of 6.0 A mu
   g/aeHz noise floor, 3.2 A mu g bias instability, and a maximum of 130 dB
   DR at 1 Hz. A FSR of +/- 20 g is reported for 6.2 A mu g/aeHz noise
   floor. This range can be increased up to +/- 40 g at the cost of noise
   performance and DR.}},

Title = {{The Role of Zic Genes in Inner Ear Development in the Mouse: Exploring
   Mutant Mouse Phenotypes}},

Abstract = {{Background: Murine Zic genes (Zic1-5) are expressed in the dorsal
   hindbrain and in periotic mesenchyme (POM) adjacent to the developing
   inner ear. Zic genes are involved in developmental signaling pathways in
   many organ systems, including the ear, although their exact roles
   haven't been fully elucidated. This report examines the role of Zic1,
   Zic2, and Zic4 during inner ear development in mouse mutants in which
   these Zic genes are affected. Results: Zic1/Zic4 double mutants don't
   exhibit any apparent defects in inner ear morphology. By contrast, inner
   ears from Zic2(kd/kd) and Zic2(Ku/Ku) mutants have severe but variable
   morphological defects in endolymphatic duct/sac and semicircular canal
   formation and in cochlear extension in the inner ear. Analysis of
   otocyst patterning in the Zic2(Ku/Ku) mutants by in situ hybridization
   showed changes in the expression patterns of Gbx2 and Pax2. Conclusions:
   The experiments provide the first genetic evidence that the Zic genes
   are required for morphogenesis of the inner ear. Zic2 loss-of-function
   doesn't prevent initial otocyst patterning but leads to molecular
   abnormalities concomitant with morphogenesis of the endolymphatic duct.
   Functional hearing deficits often accompany inner ear dysmorphologies,
   making Zic2 a novel candidate gene for ongoing efforts to identify the
   genetic basis of human hearing loss. Developmental Dynamics

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for determining the effective homogenous
   beam parameters for stranded cables made up of non-homogenous wires, as
   well as characterization of the attachment method commonly used for
   cable harnesses on space structures. There is not yet a predictive model
   for quantifying the structural impact of cable harnesses on space flight
   structures, and towards this goal, the authors aim to predict cable
   resonance behavior from basic cable measurements. Cables can be modeled
   as shear beams, but the shear beam model assumes a homogenous, isotropic
   material, which a stranded cable is not. Thus, the cable-beam model
   requires both knowledge of the cable constraints and calculation of
   effectively homogenous properties, including density, area, bending
   stiffness, and modulus of rigidity to predict the natural frequencies of
   the cable. Through a combination of measurement and correction factors,
   upper and lower bounds for effective cable properties and attachment
   stiffness are calculated and shown to be effective in a cable-beam model
   for natural frequency prediction. Although the cables investigated are
   spaceflight cables, the method can be applied to any stranded cable for
   which the constituent material properties can be determined.}},

   found that the absorption at visible region can be enhanced at an
   optimized period (P) and height (H) combination, despite the weakening
   of a cavity resonance at the a-Si layer. The short-circuit current
   density for the structure with P=300 nm and H=180 nm showed a 52\%
   higher value than that of the reference. A random texture was also
   simulated, and the absorption spectrum of the a-Si layer was reproduced
   by superposition of those with sinusoidal textures weighted by power
   spectrum density of the random texture, which implies the superiority of

Abstract = {{This paper aims to provide a detailed assessment of some of the existing
   residual stress profiles stipulated in widely used fitness-for-service
   assessment codes and standards, such as BS 7910 Appendix Q and API 579
   RP Annex E, by taking advantage of some comprehensive residual stress
   studies that have recently become available. After presenting a case
   study on which residual stress measurements are available for validating
   finite element based residual stress analysis procedure, residual stress
   profiles stipulated in BS 7910 for pipe girth welds are selected for
   detailed evaluation by comparing residual stress distribution
   characteristics shown in parametric finite element results. A shell
   theory based full-field residual stress profile estimation scheme is
   then presented to illustrate how an improved estimation of residual
   stress profiles can be achieved in light of some of the deficiencies in
   BS 7910 and API 579 identified in this study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Leiomodin-3 dysfunction results in thin filament disorganization and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4693-4708}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a genetic muscle disorder characterized by
   muscle dysfunction and electron-dense protein accumulations (nemaline
   bodies) in myofibers. Pathogenic mutations have been described in 9
   genes to date, but the genetic basis remains unknown in many cases.
   Here, using an approach that combined whole-exome sequencing (WES) and
   Sanger sequencing, we identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
   variants in LMOD3 in 21 patients from 14 families with severe, usually
   lethal, NM. LMOD3 encodes leiomodin-3 (LMOD3), a 65-kDa protein
   expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. LMOD3 was expressed from early
   stages of muscle differentiation; localized to actin thin filaments,
   with enrichment near the pointed ends; and had strong actin
   filament-nucleating activity. Loss of LMOD3 in patient muscle resulted
   in shortening and disorganization of thin filaments. Knockdown of Imod3
   in zebrafish replicated NM-associated functional and pathological
   phenotypes. Together, these findings indicate that mutations in the gene
   encoding LMOD3 underlie congenital myopathy and demonstrate that LMOD3
   is essential for the organization of sarcomeric thin filaments in
   skeletal muscle.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented for the on-orbit calibration of photodiodes for
   sun sensing in an attitude determination system. The calibration
   estimates the scale factors and alignment angles of the photodiodes,
   resulting in a higher attitude determination accuracy than achieved with
   the preflight calibration parameters. The calibration is accomplished
   through the simultaneous estimation of the spacecraft attitude and
   calibration parameters. This approach, as opposed to an
   attitude-dependent method, enables the calibration of an arbitrary
   number of photodiodes mounted in any orientation on the spacecraft and
   facilitates the use of an attitude- dependent Earth albedo model. The
   method is formulated within both an extended Kalman filter and an
   unscented filter. The filters are demonstrated by application to flight
   data from the Radio Aurora Explorer satellites and result in an average
   angular improvement of 10 deg in sun vector measurements with the
   photodiodes. Attitude determination accuracies of below 1 deg in each
   axis are demonstrated using the calibrated photodiodes in combination
   with a low-cost three-axis magnetometer and rate gyroscope.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
   (DCE-MRI) in a rat glioma model, and nested model selection (NMS), to
   compare estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters v(p), K-trans, and
   ve for two different contrast agents (CAs)-gadofosveset, which
   reversibly binds to human serum albumin, and gadopentetate dimeglumine,
   which does not. Materials and Methods: DCE-MRI studies were performed on
   nine Fisher 344 rats inoculated intracerebrally with 9L gliosarcoma
   cells using both gadofosveset and gadopentetate. The parameters v(p),
   K-trans, and v(e) were estimated using NMS. Results: K-trans estimates
   using gadofosveset, compared to gadopentetate, differed in their means
   (gadofosveset 0.025 +/- 0.008 min(-1) vs. gadopentetate 0.046 +/- 0.011
   min(-1); P = 0.0039). This difference notwithstanding, the intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) for the two estimates of K trans showed
   nearly perfect linear dependence (ICC = 0.8479 by Pearson's r). Other
   estimates, v(e) (gado-fosveset 22.7 6 4.7\% v(s). gadopentetate 23.6 6
   5.6\%; P = 0.4258) and v(p) (gadofosveset 1.5 6 0.5\% vs. gadopente-tate
   1.6 6 0.4\%; P = 0.25), were not different in their means between the
   two CAs, and there was almost perfect agreement for ve (ICC = 0.8798)
   and substantial agreement for vp (ICC = 0.7981) between the two CAs.
   Conclusion: Estimates of K trans were statistically different using
   gadofosveset and gadopentetate, whereas ve and vp were similar with two
   CAs. NMS produced robust estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters using
   DCE-MRI that show promise as important measures of tumor physiology and
   microenvironment.}},

Abstract = {{Background and ObjectiveRenal denervation has recently become of great
   interest as a potential treatment for resistant hypertension.
   Denervation techniques using radio frequency (RF) or ultrasound energy
   sources have already been explored in literature. In this study, we
   investigate the use of lasers as a potential energy source for renal
   denervation. In vitro studies are performed in porcine/ovine renal
   arteries with focused laser beams at 980nm, 1210nm, and 1700nm to study
   the ability to damage renal nerves without causing injury to non-target
   tissue structures like the endothelium. Then, a 980nm laser catheter
   prototype is built and used to demonstrate in vivo renal denervation in
   ovine renal arteries.
   Subjects and MethodsThis study utilizes fiber coupled infrared lasers at
   980nm, 1210nm, and 1700nm. In vitro laser denervation studies at 980nm
   are performed in both porcine and ovine renal arteries to study the
   ability of focused laser beams to damage renal nerves without injuring
   the endothelium. In vitro studies using lasers close to the lipid
   absorption lines at 1210nm and 1700nm are also performed in porcine
   renal arteries to study the possibility of selectively damaging the
   renal nerves by targeting the lipid myelin sheaths surrounding the
   nerves. Then, a laser catheter prototype is designed and built for in
   vivo renal denervation in ovine renal arteries using the 980nm laser
   (powers ranging from 2 to 4W, 5 seconds per exposure). Histochemical
   evaluations of the frozen sections are performed using
   methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.
   ResultsHistochemical analysis of in vitro laser treatments at 980nm in
   porcine and ovine renal arteries show clear evidence of laser-induced
   renal nerve damage without injury to the endothelium and part of the
   media. No evidence of selective nerve damage is observed using the
   1210nm and 1700nm lasers with the current treatment parameters.
   Histochemical analysis of in vivo laser treatments in ovine renal
   arteries using a focused 980nm laser show clear evidence of renal nerve
   damage with depths of damage extending>1.5mm from the artery wall.
   Sections with laser-induced damage to the media/adventitia at depths
   of>1mm without injury to the endothelium are also observed.
   ConclusionsWe demonstrate the use of focused lasers as an attractive
   energy source for causing renal nerve damage without injury to the
   artery wall and thus, may have potential therapeutic applications for
   conditions such as resistant hypertension, where renal denervation has
   been shown to be a promising form of treatment. Lasers Surg. Med.

Title = {{Comparing the effects of age, BMI and gender on severe injury (AIS 3+)
   in motor-vehicle crashes}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{146-160}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The effects of age, body mass index (BMI) and gender on
   motor vehicle crash (MVC) injuries are not well understood and current
   prevention efforts do not effectively address variability in occupant
   characteristics.
   Objectives: (1) Characterize the effects of age, BMI and gender on
   serious-to-fatal MVC injury. (2) Identify the crash modes and body
   regions where the effects of occupant characteristics on the numbers of
   occupants with injury is largest, and thereby aid in prioritizing the
   need for human surrogates that represent different types of occupant
   characteristics and adaptive restraint systems that consider these
   characteristics.
   Methods: Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the effects
   of occupant characteristics (age, BMI, gender), vehicle and crash
   characteristics on serious-to-fatal injuries (AIS 3+) by body region and
   crash mode using the 2000-2010 National Automotive Sampling System
   (NASS-CDS) dataset. Logistic regression models were applied to weighted
   crash data to estimate the change in the number of annual injured
   occupants with AIS 3+ injury that would occur if occupant
   characteristics were limited to their 5th percentiles (age <= 17 years
   old, BMI <= 19 kg/m(2)) or male gender.
   Results: Limiting age was associated with a decrease in the total number
   of occupants with head {[}8396, 95\% CI 6871-9070] and thorax injuries
   {[}17,961,95\% CI 15,960-18,859] across all crash modes, decreased
   occupants with spine {[}3843,95\% CI 3065-4242] and upper extremity
   {[}3578,95\% CI 1402-4439] injuries in frontal and rollover crashes and
   decreased abdominal {[}1368,95\% CI 1062-1417] and lower extremity
   {[}4584,95\% CI 4012-4995] injuries in frontal impacts. The age effect
   was modulated by gender with older females more likely to have thorax
   and upper extremity injuries than older males. Limiting BMI was
   associated with 2069 {[}95\% CI 1107-2775] fewer thorax injuries in
   nearside crashes, and 5304 {[}95\% Cl 4279-5688] fewer lower extremity
   injuries in frontal crashes. Setting gender to male resulted in fewer
   occupants with head injuries in farside crashes {[}1999, 95\% CI
   844-2685] and fewer thorax {[}5618, 95\% CI 4212-62721, upper
   {[}3804,95\% CI 1781-4803] and lower extremity {[}2791,95\% CI
   2216-3256] injuries in frontal crashes. Results indicate that age
   provides the greater relative contribution to injury when compared to
   gender and BMI, especially for thorax and head injuries.
   Conclusions: Restraint systems that account for the differential injury
   risks associated with age, BMI and gender could have a meaningful effect
   on injury in motor-vehicle crashes. Computational models of humans that
   represent older, high BMI, and female occupants are needed for use in
   simulations of particular types of crashes to develop these restraint
   systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aerodynamic shape optimization of aircraft configurations often ignores
   stability considerations. To address this, a method for the computation
   of static, dynamic, and transient aircraft stability derivatives and
   their sensitivities for use in gradient-based optimization is introduced
   and evaluated. Computational fluid dynamics in the form of a
   three-dimensional structured-grid multiblock flow solver with both Euler
   and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations is used. To compute the
   stability derivatives, a time-spectral formulation is used to compute an
   oscillating solution for the configuration of interest. From this
   oscillating solution, a series of linear regressions is performed to
   calculate the various stability derivatives. Because the solution is
   time dependent, it contains the information required to compute the
   transient, or ``dot,{''} derivatives for the configuration. An adjoint
   method is used to compute the gradients of the stability derivatives of
   interest, enabling gradient-based stability-constrained aerodynamic
   shape optimization with respect to a large number of design variables.
   The computed stability derivatives are verified for an airfoil and
   validated for a generic unmanned combat aerial vehicle. The
   stability-constrained optimization of a wing demonstrates the viability
   and usefulness of the method for aircraft design optimization.}},

   Theoretically, we demonstrate that the dispersion can be altered to

   PhC also demonstrates slow light that facilitate sensing chemicals or
   biological agents. Using metallic materials such as gold nano-particle
   enables PhCs to guide optical waves in desired pathways. Also using
   magnetic materials such as highly doped n-GaAs, we can tune the band gap
   by changing magnetic field. The simulated results are consistent with
   some of the previously reported experimental results and give us
   guidance for future experiments.}},

Title = {{A distributed parameter electromechanical and statistical model for
   energy harvesting from turbulence-induced vibration}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Extensive research has been done on the topics of both
   turbulence-induced vibration and vibration based energy harvesting;
   however, little effort has been put into bringing these two topics
   together. Preliminary experimental studies have shown that piezoelectric
   structures excited by turbulent flow can produce significant amounts of
   useful power. This research could serve to benefit applications such as
   powering remote, self-sustained sensors in small rivers or air
   ventilation systems where turbulent fluid flow is a primary source of
   ambient energy. A novel solution for harvesting energy in these
   unpredictable fluid flow environments was explored by the authors in
   previous work, and a harvester prototype was developed. This prototype,
   called piezoelectric grass, has been the focus of many experimental
   studies. In this paper the authors present a theoretical analysis of the
   piezoelectric grass harvester modeled as a single unimorph cantilever
   beam exposed to turbulent cross-flow. This distributed parameter model
   was developed using a combination of both analytical and statistical
   techniques. The analytical portion uses a Rayleigh-Ritz approximation
   method to describe the beam dynamics, and utilizes piezoelectric
   constitutive relationships to define the electromechanical coupling
   effects. The statistical portion of the model defines the
   turbulence-induced forcing function distributed across the beam surface.
   The model presented in this paper was validated using results from
   several experimental case studies. Preliminary results show that the
   model agrees quite well with experimental data. A parameter optimization
   study was performed with the proposed model. This study demonstrated how
   a new harvester could be designed to achieve maximum power output in a
   given turbulent fluid flow environment.}},

Abstract = {{Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of ethylene/air diffusion flame
   extinctions in decaying two-dimensional turbulence were performed. A
   Damkohler-number-based flame extinction criterion as provided by
   classical large activation energy asymptotic (AEA) theory is assessed
   for its validity in predicting flame extinction and compared to one
   based on Chemical Explosive Mode Analysis (CEMA) of the detailed
   chemistry. The DNS code solves compressible flow conservation equations
   using high order finite difference and explicit time integration
   schemes. The ethylene/air chemistry is simulated with a reduced
   mechanism that is generated based on the directed relation graph (DRG)
   based methods along with stiffness removal. The numerical configuration
   is an ethylene fuel strip embedded in ambient air and exposed to a
   prescribed decaying turbulent flow field. The emphasis of this study is
   on the several flame extinction events observed in contrived parametric
   simulations. A modified viscosity and changing pressure (MVCP) scheme
   was adopted in order to artificially manipulate the probability of flame
   extinction. Using MVCP, pressure was changed from the baseline case of 1
   atm to 0.1 and 10 atm. In the high pressure MVCP case, the simulated
   flame is extinction-free, whereas in the low pressure MVCP case, the
   simulated flame features frequent extinction events and is close to
   global extinction. Results show that, despite its relative simplicity
   and provided that the global flame activation temperature is correctly
   calibrated, the AEA-based flame extinction criterion can accurately
   predict the simulated flame extinction events. It is also found that the
   AEA-based criterion provides predictions of flame extinction that are
   consistent with those provided by a CEMA-based criterion. This study
   supports the validity of a simple Damkohler-number-based criterion to
   predict flame extinction in engineering-level CFD models. (c) 2014 The

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{219}},
Pages = {{32-37}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{While surface capacitance is utilized widely for sensing and actuation
   in miniaturized systems, relatively little attention has been paid to
   its enhancement using engineered surface topography. We present how an
   engineered surface topography, specifically a cylindrical micropillar
   array, gives a significant enhancement of the surface capacitance
   compared to a flat surface of the same area. Arrays of silicon
   micropillars were fabricated and measured, and the results were
   validated using both an approximate analytical model and a numerical
   finite element model. At large gaps (hundreds of microns) between a flat
   probe and the top surface of the array, the capacitance is comparable to
   that of a flat surface, while at smaller gaps (<200 mu m) the
   contribution of the side surface leads to enhancement of the
   capacitance. We demonstrate that parametric variation of the array
   geometry and gap can result in greater than 100\% enhancement, while
   using materials and dimensions compatible with standard microfabrication
   processes. Therefore, we expect that this engineered surface design can
   improve the performance of traditional capacitance Probes as well as
   emerging applications such as flexible tactile sensors. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) contain a small
   subpopulation of stem cells endowed with unique capacity to generate
   tumors. These cancer stem cells (CSC) are localized in perivascular
   niches and rely on crosstalk with endothelial cells for survival and
   self-renewal, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. Here, we report
   that stromal interleukin (IL)-6 defines the tumorigenic capacity of CSC
   sorted from primary human HNSCC and transplanted into mice. In search
   for the cellular source of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), we observed a direct
   correlation between IL-6 levels in tumor-associated endothelial cells
   and the tumorigenicity of CSC. In vitro, endothelial cell-IL-6 enhanced
   orosphere formation, p-STAT3 activation, survival, and self-renewal of
   human CSC. Notably, a humanized anti-IL-6R antibody (tocilizumab)
   inhibited primary human CSC-mediated tumor initiation. Collectively,
   these data demonstrate that endothelial cell-secreted IL-6 defines the
   tumorigenic potential of CSC, and suggest that HNSCC patients might
   benefit from therapeutic inhibition of IL-6/IL-6R signaling.}},

Title = {{Quantifying surgical complexity with machine learning: Looking beyond

Journal = {{SURGERY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{156}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1097-1105}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To investigate the use of machine learning to empirically
   determine the risk of individual surgical procedures and to improve
   surgical models with this information.
   Methods. American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality
   Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) data from 2005 to 2009 were used to
   train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to learn the relationship
   between textual constructs in current procedural terminology (CPT)
   descriptions and mortality, morbidity, Clavien 4 complications, and
   surgical-site infections (SSI) within 30 days of surgery. The procedural
   risk scores produced by the SVM classifiers were validated on data from
   2010 in univariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results. The procedural risk scores produced by the SVM classifiers
   achieved moderate-to-high levels of discrimination in univariate
   analyses (area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.871 for
   mortality, 0.789 for morbidity, 0.791 for SSI, 0.845 for Clavien 4
   complications). Addition of these scores also substantially improved
   multivariate models comprising patient factors and previously proposed
   correlates of procedural risk (net reclassification improvement and
   integrated discrimination improvement: 0.54 and 0.001 for mortality,
   0.46 and 0.011 for morbidity, 0.68 and 0.022 for SSI, 0.44 and 0.001 for
   Clavien 4 complications; P < .05 for all comparisons). Similar
   improvements were noted in discrimination and calibration for other
   statistical measures, and in subcohorts comprising patients with general
   or vascular surgery.
   Conclusion. Machine learning provides clinically useful estimates of
   surgical risk for individual procedures. This information can be
   measured in an entirely data-driven manner and substantially improves
   multifactorial models to predict postoperative complications.}},

Title = {{Improving surrogate-assisted variable fidelity multi-objective
   optimization using a clustering algorithm}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{482-493}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization has proved to be effective
   in reducing optimization time, as surrogates, or meta-models can
   approximate expensive fitness functions in the optimization run. While
   this is a successful strategy to improve optimization efficiency,
   challenges arise when constructing surrogate models in higher
   dimensional function space, where the trade space between multiple
   conflicting objectives is increasingly complex. This complexity makes it
   difficult to ensure the accuracy of the surrogates. In this article, a
   new surrogate management strategy is presented to address this problem.
   A k-means clustering algorithm is employed to partition model data into
   local surrogate models. The variable fidelity optimization scheme
   proposed in the author's previous work is revised to incorporate this
   clustering algorithm for surrogate model construction. The applicability
   of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on six standard test problems.
   The presented algorithm is also examined in a three-objective stiffened
   panel optimization design problem to show its superiority in
   surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization in higher dimensional
   objective function space. Performance metrics show that the proposed
   surrogate handling strategy clearly outperforms the single surrogate
   strategy as the surrogate size increases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges of cosimulating hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
   systems in real-time over the Internet is the fidelity of the
   simulation. The dynamics of the Internet may significantly distort the
   dynamics of the network-integrated system. This paper presents the
   development and experimental validation of an iterative learning control
   (ILC) based approach to improve fidelity of such networked system
   integration. Toward this end, a new metric for characterizing coupling
   fidelity is proposed, which, unlike some existing metrics, enables the
   formulation of the problem of improving system fidelity without
   requiring any knowledge about the reference dynamics (i.e., dynamics
   that would be observed, if the system was physically connected). Next,
   using this metric, the problem of improving fidelity is formulated as an
   ILC problem. The proposed approach is illustrated on an experimental
   setup simulating a hybrid electric powertrain distributed across three
   different sites with a real engine and battery in the loop. The
   conclusion is that the proposed approach holds significant potential for
   achieving high fidelity in Internet-distributed HIL (ID-HIL) simulation
   setups.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid vehicle fuel economy and drive quality are coupled through the
   ``energy management{''} controller that regulates power flow among the
   various energy sources and sinks. This paper studies energy management
   controllers designed using shortest path stochastic dynamic programming
   (SP-SDP), a stochastic optimal control design method which can respect
   constraints on drivetrain activity while minimizing fuel consumption for
   an assumed distribution of driver power demand. The performance of
   SP-SDP controllers is evaluated through simulation on large numbers of
   real-world drive cycles and compared to a baseline industrial controller
   provided by a major auto manufacturer. On real-world driving data, the
   SP-SDP-based controllers yield 10\% better fuel economy than the
   baseline industrial controller, for the same engine and gear activity.
   The SP-SDP controllers are further evaluated for robustness to the drive
   cycle statistics used in their design. Simplified drivability metrics
   introduced in previous work are validated on large real-world data sets.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to understand the effects of superior humeral head translation
   and load of the long head of biceps on the pathomechanics of the
   superior glenoid labrum by predicting labral strain. Using micro-CT
   cadaver images, a finite element model of the glenohumeral joint was
   generated, consisting of humerus, glenoid bone, cartilages, labrum, and
   biceps tendon. A glenohumeral compression of 50N and biceps tensions of
   0, 22, 55, and 88N were applied. The humeral head was superiorly
   translated from 0 to 5mm in 1-mm increments. The highest labral strain
   occurred at the interface with the glenoid cartilage and bone beneath
   the origin of the biceps tendon. The maximum strain was lower than the
   reported failure strain. The humeral head motion had relatively greater
   effect than biceps tension on the increasing labral strain. This
   supports the mechanistic hypothesis that superior labral lesions result
   mainly from superior migration of the humeral head, but also from biceps
   tension. (c) 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Thermal management is critically important to maintain the performance
   and prolong the lifetime of a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery. In this
   paper, a two-dimensional and transient model has been developed for the
   thermal management of a 20-flat-plate-battery stack, followed by
   comprehensive numerical simulations to study the influences of ambient
   temperature, Reynolds number, and discharge rate on the temperature
   distribution in the stack with different cooling materials. The
   simulation results indicate that liquid cooling is generally more
   effective in reducing temperature compared to phase-change material,
   while the latter can lead to more homogeneous temperature distribution.
   Fast and deep discharge should be avoided, which generally yields high
   temperature beyond the acceptable range regardless of cooling materials.
   At low or even subzero ambient temperatures, air cooling is preferred
   over liquid cooling because heat needs to be retained rather than
   removed. Such difference becomes small when the ambient temperature
   increases to a mild level. The effects of Reynolds number are apparent
   in liquid cooling but negligible in air cooling. Choosing appropriate
   cooling material and strategy is particularly important in low ambient
   temperature and fast discharge cases. These findings improve the
   understanding of battery stack thermal behaviors and provide the general
   guidelines for thermal management system. The present model can also be
   used in developing control system to optimize battery stack thermal
   behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As the number of smart meters/sensors increases to more than hundreds of
   thousands, it is rather intuitive that the state-of-the-art centralized
   information processing architecture will no longer be sustainable under
   such a big data explosion. Hence, an innovative data management system
   is urgently needed to facilitate the real-world deployment of a future
   residential distribution system. In this paper, we investigate a
   radically different approach through distributed software agents to
   translate the legacy centralized data storage and processing scheme to a
   completely distributed cyber-physical architecture. We further
   substantiate the proposed distributed data storage and processing
   framework on a proof-of-concept testbed using a cluster of low-cost and
   credit-card-sized single-board computers. Finally, we evaluate the
   proposed distributed framework and proof-of-concept testbed with a
   comprehensive set of performance measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The critical heat flux (CHF) during reduced graphene oxide (RGO) colloid
   pool boiling was increased by the development of coating layers from the
   RGO flakes. By boiling water after boiling RGO colloid, we confirmed
   that the CHF enhancement was due to the development of RGO coating
   layers such as the base graphene layer (BGL), self-assembled foam-like
   graphene structure (SFG), and thickly aggregated graphene layer (TGL).
   During RGO colloid boiling, we observed an interesting phenomenon after
   the CHF point: when the heat flux reached the maximum value (CHF), the
   wall temperature slowly began to increase while the heat flux was
   maintained, unlike the rapid wall temperature increase that is observed
   during water boiling. We examined the stability of this phenomenon and
   the boiling hysteresis in relation to the heat flux. We hypothesized
   that the BGL and SFG could induce this phenomenon by functioning as heat
   spreaders, owing to the greatly enhanced thermal conductivity during the
   formation of hot/dry spots, and the vapor escape resistance during
   boiling on a porous medium. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   under an electric field}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{820-829}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a 3D phase field model is presented for a numerical study
   of the hydrodynamic behavior of a bubble rising in fluid subject to an
   external electric field. The computational model entails a numerical
   solution to the Laplace equation for electric field, the Navier-Stokes
   equation for fluid flow and Cahn-Hilliard equation for interface
   deformation and morphology. These equations are discretized by time
   marching finite difference scheme and an in-house FORTRAN code program
   is developed to enable the simulation. The coupled electric-fluid-flow
   model is capable of predicting the evolution of electric field and the
   deformation of rising bubble in medium fluid. Special interests are
   focused on the influence of electrical force on the motion of a bubble
   as it ascends through the viscous medium liquid. It is found that a
   vertical electric field accelerates the ascending of a bubble while a
   horizontal one decelerates it. Also, the electric field, either
   horizontal or vertical, affects the morphology of the bubble as it rises
   by buoyancy. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{78}},

Abstract = {{A numerical investigation of steady laminar mixed convection flow and
   heat transfer in a lid driven cavity with a flexible heated bottom
   surface is investigated. Moreover, the heated bottom wall is
   characterized by rectangular and sinusoidal wavy profiles for a rigid
   wall analysis. A stable thermal stratification configuration was
   considered by imposing a vertical temperature gradient while the
   vertical walls were considered to be insulated. The transport equations
   are solved using a finite element formulation based on the Galerkin
   method of weighted residuals. For a flexible bottom wall case, a fully
   coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis is utilized and the
   fluid domain is described by an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
   formulation that is fully coupled to the structure domain. The results
   of this investigation revealed that the heat transfer enhancement is
   noticed in all the studied cases compared with a flat bottom wall case.
   Furthermore, the contribution of the forced convection heat transfer to
   that offered by natural convection heat transfer has a profound effect
   on the behavior of the flexible wall as well as the momentum and energy
   transport processes within the cavity. Flexible bottom wall case is
   found to exhibit significant heat transfer enhancement (61.4\%) compared
   with a flat bottom wall case at Grashof number of 10(4) and Re < 400.
   However, rectangular wavy profile exhibits higher heat transfer
   enhancement (maximum: 14.4\% at Re = 200) than sinusoidal wavy profile
   (9.6\% at Re = 200) and flexible bottom wall (12.3\% at Re = 200) at a
   low Grashof number of 10(2). This investigation shows the benefits of
   using flexible walls when augmentation of heat transfer is sought at
   high Grashof numbers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the latency or sojourn time for the last customer in a batch
   of customers to exit from the -th queue in a tandem of queues in the
   setting where the queues are in equilibrium before the batch of
   customers arrives at the first queue. We first characterize the
   distribution of exactly for every and , under the assumption that the
   queues have unlimited buffers and that each server has
   customer-independent, exponentially distributed service times with an
   arbitrary, known rate. We then evaluate the first two leading-order
   terms of the distributions in the large and limit and bring into sharp
   focus the existence of phase transitions in the system behavior. The
   phase transition occurs due to the presence of either slow bottleneck
   servers or a high external arrival rate. We determine the critical
   thresholds for the service rate and the arrival rate, respectively,
   about which this phase transition occurs; it turns out that they are the
   same. This critical threshold depends, in a manner we make explicit, on
   the individual service rates, the number of customers, and the number of
   queues but not on the external arrival rate.}},

Abstract = {{Multiferroic materials have been the subject of intense study, but it
   remains a great challenge to synthesize those presenting both magnetic
   and ferroelectric polarizations at room temperature. In this work, we
   have successfully obtained LiNbO3-type ScFeO3, a metastable phase
   converted from the orthorhombic perovskite formed under 15 GPa at
   elevated temperatures. A combined structure analysis by synchrotron
   X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and high-angle annular dark-field
   scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging reveals that this
   compound adopts the polar R(3)c symmetry with a fully ordered
   arrangement of trivalent Sc and Fe ions, forming highly distorted ScO6
   and FeO6 octahedra. The calculated spontaneous polarization along the
   hexagonal c-axis is as large as 100 mu C/cm(2). The magnetic studies
   show that LiNbO3-type ScFeO3 is a weak ferromagnet with TN = 545 K due
   to a canted G-type antiferromagnetic ordering of Fe3+ spins,
   representing the first example of LiNbO3-type oxides with magnetic
   ordering far above room temperature. A comparison of the present
   compound and rare-earth orthorhombic perovskites RFeO3 (R = La-Lu and
   Y), all of which possess the corner-shared FeO6 octahedral network,
   allows us to find a correlation between TN and the Fe-O-Fe bond angle,
   indicating that the A-site cation-size-dependent octahedral tilting
   dominates the magnetic transition through the Fe-O-Fe superexchange
   interaction. This work provides a general and versatile strategy to
   create materials in which ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism coexist at
   high temperatures}},

Abstract = {{Methods to analyze and synthesize two-dimensional, bianisotropic

   bianisotropic metasurface is analyzed by using closed-form expressions
   that relate the reflection and transmission coefficients to its
   constituent surface parameters. Next, a systematic method to synthesize
   bianisotropic metasurfaces is outlined. It is analytically shown that
   bianisotropic metasurfaces can be realized by cascading anisotropic,
   patterned metallic sheets (electric sheet admittances). This geometry
   allows for straightforward design and fabrication from microwave to
   optical wavelengths. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method,
   four devices exhibiting exotic polarization transformations are
   presented: a polarization rotator, an asymmetric circular polarizer, an
   asymmetric linear polarizer, and a symmetric circular polarizer. The
   optimal performance at centimeter, millimeter, and micrometer
   wavelengths highlights the versatility of the design process.}},

Title = {{Controlling Vector Bessel Beams with Metasurfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Unprecedented control of an electromagnetic wave front is demonstrated
   with reflectionless meta-surfaces that can manipulate vector Bessel
   beams: cylindrical vector beams with a Bessel profile. First, two
   metasurfaces are developed to convert linearly and circularly polarized
   Gaussian beams into vector Bessel beams. Each unit cell of the
   metasurfaces provides polarization and phase control with high
   efficiency. Next, the reciprocal process is demonstrated: an incident
   radially polarized Bessel beam is transformed into collimated, linearly
   and circularly polarized beams. In this configuration, a planar Bessel
   beam launcher is integrated with a collimating metasurface lens to
   realize a low-profile lens-antenna. The lens-antenna achieves a high
   directivity (exceeding 20 dB) with a subwavelength overall thickness.
   Finally, a metasurface providing isotropic polarization rotation is used
   to transform a radially polarized Bessel beam into an azimuthally
   polarized Bessel beam. This work demonstrates that metasurfaces can be
   used to generate arbitrary combinations of radial and azimuthal
   polarizations for applications such as focus shaping or generating
   tractor beams.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemistry of Mg salts in room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs)
   was studied using plating/stripping voltammetry to assess the viability
   of IL solvents for applications in secondary Mg batteries. Borohydride
   (BH4-), trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfO-), and
   bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Tf2N-) salts of Mg were
   investigated. Three ILs were considered: l-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
   (BMIM)-Tf2N, N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium (PP13)-Tf2N, and
   N,N-diethyl-N-methyl(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium (DEME+) tetrafluoroborate
   (BF4-). Salts and ILs were combined to produce binary solutions in which
   the anions were structurally similar or identical, if possible. Contrary
   to some prior reports, no salt/IL combination appeared to facilitate
   reversible Mg plating. In solutions containing BMIM(+), oxidative
   activity near 0.8 V vs Mg/Mg2+ is likely associated with the BMIM
   cation, rather than Mg stripping. The absence of voltammetric signatures
   of Mg plating from ILs with Tf2N- and BF4- suggests that strong Mg/anion
   Coulombic attraction inhibits electrodeposition. Cosolvent additions to
   Mg(Tf2N)(2)/PP13-Tf2N were explored but did not result in enhanced
   plating/stripping activity. The results highlight the need for IL
   solvents or cosolvent systems that promote Mg2+ dissociation.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a subgap density of states (DOS) model of amorphous
   In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) based on optical and electrical measurements. We
   study the optical absorption spectrum of the a-IGZO using UV-Vis
   spectroscopy. Together with the first-principles calculations and
   transient photoconductance spectroscopy from the literature, we
   determine that the valence band tail and deep-gap states are donors and
   can be described by exponential and Gaussian distributions,
   respectively. The conduction band tail and deep-gap states are examined
   using multi-frequency capacitance- voltage spectroscopy on a-IGZO
   thin-film transistors (TFTs). The extracted conduction band DOS are
   fitted to exponential (bandtail) and Gaussian (deep-gap) functions and
   their validity are supported by the activation energy vs. gate-source
   bias relationship of the a-IGZO TFT. The PL deep-level emission, which
   is almost identical to the conduction band deep-gap Gaussian, suggests
   that these states should be assigned as acceptors. The donor/acceptor
   assignments of subgap states are consistent with the 2D numerical TFT
   simulations. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, novel 3D multifunctional nanolayers are fabricated on
   biomedical membrane surfaces via layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly of
   nanogels and heparin-like polymers. To integrate long-term antibacterial
   activity, Ag nanoparticles embedded in nanogels were first prepared.
   Then, the Ag nanogels were assembled onto membrane surfaces by
   electrostatic interaction. To obtain a heparin-mimicking surface, the
   as-prepared nanogel-coated membranes were further assembled with
   heparin-like polymers by two different processes. The results indicated
   that the obtained nanogel and heparin-mimicking polymer assembled
   membranes exhibited 3D surface morphologies. Systematical blood
   compatibility and antithrombotic evaluations revealed that the
   functionalized membranes showed increased hydrophilicity, decreased
   protein adsorption, and prolonged clotting times and greatly suppressed
   platelet adhesion compared to pristine membrane. The cell culture
   observations demonstrated that the pristine, nanogel-assembled, and
   heparin-mimicking membranes showed different performances in terms of
   endothelial cell proliferation and adhesion morphology. The results of
   the antibacterial study indicated that the functionalized membranes
   exhibited significant inhibition capability for Escherichia coli and
   Staphylococcus aureus. In general, the surface coassembly of nanogels
   and heparin-mimicking polymers produced functionalized membranes with
   integrated blood compatibility, cell proliferation and antibacterial
   properties for multiple applications, which may advance the fabrication
   of biomedical devices by surface assembly of functional nanogels.}},

Title = {{Modeling Juvenile Salmonid Hatchery Growth Using a Local Equilibrium
   Assumption and Measured Water Fraction to Parameterize Fish Energy
   Density}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{434}},
Pages = {{5-10}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Previous reports have described bioenergetic models for juvenile
   salmonid growth that were validated using data from laboratory and
   production-scale feeding studies. Time variable functions and power
   correlations with body weight based on measurement of proximate
   composition were used to delineate the fish energy density in these
   models. Although model simulations for growth corresponded closely with
   measured data using either characterization of energy density, there is
   significant laboratory burden associated with the measurement of
   proximate composition throughout the simulation period, and this
   approach may therefore be impractical for many hatchery applications.
   Here measurements of fish water fraction are used to estimate the mass
   of protein and ash using correlations developed in a companion paper.
   Lipid is subsequently determined by difference, and energy content is
   calculated using the proximate composition. Model simulations of
   juvenile coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) growth and proximate composition
   using this approach closely matched measured data when provided steady
   satiation and maintenance rations. The model was less successful
   predicting detailed protein and lipid dynamics following large abrupt
   decreases in the food supply rate. However, model simulation errors
   associated with fish growth were small because of the off-setting nature
   of the proximate composition model errors. It is concluded that coho
   water fraction measurements and correlations for protein and ash offer a
   practical and convenient alternative to direct measurement of fish
   energy density for many bioenergetic model hatchery applications. (C)

Abstract = {{The femtosecond laser generation of ZnSe nanoscale features on ZnSe

   10-100 nm agglomerations of nanocrystalline ZnSe while retaining the

   structure of these nanodots was verified using a combination of scanning
   transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and
   atomic force microscopy. The nanodots continue to grow hours after
   irradiation through a combination of bulk and surface diffusion. We
   suggest that in nanodot formation the result of ultrafast laser induced
   point defect formation is more than an order of magnitude below the ZnSe
   ultrafast melt threshold fluence. This unique mechanism of point defect

Abstract = {{To bridge the gap between theoretically predicted and experimentally

   optical concentrations (1-3,000x). On the emitter side, we show that
   suppressing or recycling sub-bandgap radiation is critical. On the
   absorber side, the relative importance of high solar absorptance versus
   low thermal emittance depends on the energy balance. Both results are
   well-described using dimensionless parameters weighting the relative
   power density above and below the cutoff wavelength. This framework can
   be used as a guide for materials selection and targeted spectral

Abstract = {{Adjustable fluidic structures play an important role in microfluidic
   systems. Fracture of multilayered materials under applied tension has
   been previously demonstrated as a convenient, simple, and inexpensive
   approach to fabricate nanoscale adjustable structures; here, it is
   demonstrated how to extend this concept to the microscale. This is
   achieved by a novel pairing of materials that leverages fracture
   mechanics to limit crack formation to a specified region, allowing to
   create size-controllable and adjustable microfluidic structures. This
   technique can be used to fabricate ``normally closed{''} microfluidic
   channels that are completely reversible, a feature that is challenging
   to achieve in conventional systems without careful engineering controls.
   The adjustable microfluidic channels are then applied to mechanically
   lyse single cells, and subsequently manipulate the released nuclear
   chromatin, creating new possibilities for epigenetic analysis of single
   cells. This simple, versatile, and robust technology provides an easily
   accessible pathway to construct adjustable microfluidic structures,
   which will be useful in developing complex assays and experiments even
   in resource-limited settings.}},

Abstract = {{Response sensitivity is an important quantity in structural reliability
   calculations, parameter importance studies, and design optimization. In
   the response sensitivity analysis of structures at ambient temperature,
   prior research has shown that the direct differentiation method provides
   improved accuracy and efficiency in comparison to the finite difference
   method. The direct differentiation method is extended here to the
   analysis of structures in fire, in which parameters exist in the fire,
   thermal and structural domains. Analytical expressions for the response
   sensitivities are derived for nonlinear heat transfer and structural
   finite elements, with specific consideration for the interdependencies
   between the physical domains. Numerical analyses were conducted for a
   steel beam exposed to natural fire conditions. Comparisons between the
   finite difference and direct differentiation methods demonstrate that
   the proposed formulations offer much promise for assessing response
   gradients of fire-exposed structures in a robust and computationally
   efficient manner. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the class of two or three-dimensional discrete contact
   problems in which a set of contact nodes can make frictional contact
   with a corresponding set of rigid obstacles. Such a system might result
   from a finite element discretization of an elastic contact problem after
   the application of standard static reduction operations. The Coulomb
   friction law requires that the tractions at any point on the contact
   boundary must lie within or on the surface of a `friction cone', but the
   exact position of any `stuck' node (i.e., a node where the tractions are
   strictly within the cone) depends on the initial conditions and/or the
   previous history of loading. If the long-term loading is periodic in
   time, we anticipate that the system will eventually approach a steady
   periodic cycle.
   Here we prove that if the elastic system is `uncoupled', meaning that
   changes in slip displacements alone have no effect on the instantaneous
   normal contact reactions, the time-varying terms in this steady cycle
   are independent of initial conditions. In particular, we establish the
   existence of a unique `permanent stick zone' T comprising the set of all
   nodes that do not slip after some finite number of cycles. We also prove
   that the tractions and slip velocities at all nodes not contained in T
   approach unique periodic functions of time, whereas the (time-invariant)
   slip displacements in T may depend on initial conditions.
   Typical examples of uncoupled systems include those where the contact
   surface is a plane of symmetry, or where the contacting bodies can be
   approximated locally as half spaces and Dundurs' mismatch parameter beta
   = 0. An important consequence of these results is that systems of this
   kind will exhibit damping characteristics that are independent of
   initial conditions. Also, the energy dissipated at each slipping node in
   the steady state is independent of initial conditions, so wear patterns
   and the incidence of fretting fatigue failure should also be so
   independent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider distributed estimation of the inverse covariance matrix,
   also called the concentration or precision matrix, in Gaussian graphical
   models. Traditional centralized estimation often requires global
   inference of the covariance matrix, which can be computationally
   intensive in large dimensions. Approximate inference based on
   message-passing algorithms, on the other hand, can lead to unstable and
   biased estimation in loopy graphical models. Here, we propose a general
   framework for distributed estimation based on a maximum marginal
   likelihood (MML) approach. This approach computes local parameter
   estimates by maximizing marginal likelihoods defined with respect to
   data collected from local neighborhoods. Due to the non-convexity of the
   MML problem, we introduce and solve a convex relaxation. The local
   estimates are then combined into a global estimate without the need for
   iterative message-passing between neighborhoods. The proposed algorithm
   is naturally parallelizable and computationally efficient, thereby
   making it suitable for high-dimensional problems. In the classical
   regime where the number of variables p is fixed and the number of
   samples T increases to infinity, the proposed estimator is shown to be
   asymptotically consistent and to improve monotonically as the local
   neighborhood size increases. In the high-dimensional scaling regime
   where both p and T increase to infinity, the convergence rate to the
   true parameters is derived and is seen to be comparable to centralized
   maximum-likelihood estimation. Extensive numerical experiments
   demonstrate the improved performance of the two-hop version of the
   proposed estimator, which suffices to almost close the gap to the
   centralized maximum likelihood estimator at a reduced computational
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Exosomes have been proposed as vehicles for microRNA (miRNA)-based
   intercellular communication and a source of miRNA biomarkers in bodily
   fluids. Although exosome preparations contain miRNAs, a quantitative
   analysis of their abundance and stoichiometry is lacking. In the course
   of studying cancer-associated extracellular miRNAs in patient blood
   samples, we found that exosome fractions contained a small minority of
   the miRNA content of plasma. This low yield prompted us to perform a
   more quantitative assessment of the relationship between miRNAs and
   exosomes using a stoichiometric approach. We quantified both the number
   of exosomes and the number of miRNA molecules in replicate samples that
   were isolated from five diverse sources (i.e., plasma, seminal fluid,
   dendritic cells, mast cells, and ovarian cancer cells). Regardless of
   the source, on average, there was far less than one molecule of a given
   miRNA per exosome, even for the most abundant miRNAs in exosome
   preparations (mean +/- SD across six exosome sources: 0.00825 +/- 0.02
   miRNA molecules/exosome). Thus, if miRNAs were distributed homogenously
   across the exosome population, on average, over 100 exosomes would need
   to be examined to observe one copy of a given abundant miRNA. This
   stoichiometry of miRNAs and exosomes suggests that most individual
   exosomes in standard preparations do not carry biologically significant
   numbers of miRNAs and are, therefore, individually unlikely to be
   functional as vehicles for miRNA-based communication. We propose revised
   models to reconcile the exosome-mediated, miRNA-based intercellular
   communication hypothesis with the observed stoichiometry of miRNAs
   associated with exosomes.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of different types of boundary conditions used in direct
   simulation Monte Carlo models of subsonic flows for single species flow
   fields is assessed in this study. An inlet boundary condition that
   permits the specification of pressure and temperature is investigated,
   as well as one that permits the specification of mass flow rate and
   temperature. A new inlet boundary condition is suggested that permits
   the total mass flow rate to be specified without requiring
   inter-processor communication during a parallel computation. Two types
   of outlet boundary conditions are investigated, one in which the outlet
   pressure is maintained by controlling the porosity of the outlet
   surface, and another in which particles are introduced at the outlet
   with properties such that the desired pressure is maintained. Each of
   the boundary conditions investigated produce flow field results for a
   single species, microchannel flow that are in good agreement with an
   analytical solution of the flow field and previously reported results.
   However, a simulation of a more complicated multi-species flow inside a
   vapor deposition reactor shows that some of the predicted flow field and
   surface properties are a function of the type of outlet boundary
   condition used. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   high amplification capability as labels. The periphery of SPAAB-HRP was
   further utilized to bind a layer of antibody with high density for
   efficient capture of analytes owing to the three-dimensional
   architecture of SPAABs. Using human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) as a

Abstract = {{Advances in microanalytical systems for multi-vapor determinations to
   date have been impeded by limitations associated with the microsensor
   technologies employed. Here we introduce a microfabricated optofluidic
   ring resonator (mu OFRR) sensor that addresses many of these
   limitations. The mu OFRR combines vapor sensing and fluidic transport
   functions in a monolithic microstructure comprising a hollow, vertical
   SiOx cylinder (250 mu m i.d., 1.2 mu m wall thickness; 85 mu m height)
   with a central quasi-toroidal mode-confinement section, grown and
   partially released from a Si substrate. The device also integrates
   on-chip fluidic-interconnection and fiber-optic probe alignment
   features. High-Q whispering gallery modes generated with a tunable 1550
   nm laser exhibit rapid, reversible shifts in resonant wavelength arising
   from polymer swelling and refractive index changes as vapors partition
   into the similar to 300 nm PDMS film lining the cylinder. Steady-state
   sensor responses varied in proportion to concentration over a 50-fold
   range for the five organic vapors tested, providing calculated detection
   limits as low as 0.5 ppm (v/v) (for m-xylene and ethyibenzene). In
   dynamic exposure tests, responses to 5 mu L injected m-xylene vapor
   pulses were 710 ms wide and were only 18\% broader than those from a
   reference flame-ionization detector and also varied linearly with
   injected mass; 180 pg was measured and the calculated detection limit
   was 49 pg without use of preconcentration or split injection, at a flow
   rate compatible with efficient chromatographic separations. Coupling of
   this mu OFRR with a micromachined gas chromatographic separation column
   is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{A one-step electrode surface modification is proposed in which a
   disposable, screen-printed carbon electrode is functionalized with
   carbonized, electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-loaded graphene (G)
   nanoparticles to form a composite, CPAN5G-4x. The electrochemical
   behavior of the CPAN5G-4x electrode was examined by cyclic voltammetry
   and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy
   and X-ray diffraction were used to characterize the surface morphology
   and physical properties of the carbonized composite nanofibers before
   and after modification. The modified electrode was found to be effective
   for the detection of dopamine (DA) using square-wave voltammetry (SWV)
   in the presence of interfering substances such as ascorbic acid and uric
   acid. With the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to an optimized
   solution of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a pH of 2, the fabricated
   electrode exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the
   oxidation of DA relative to PBS without SDS at a pH of 7.4. The SWV
   current displayed a linear response to DA concentrations ranging from
   0.5 to 100 mu M, with a limit of detection of 70 nM (S/N = 53) and a
   sensitivity of 1.4258 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2). Finally, the CPAN5G-4x
   electrode was used to determine DA levels in human serum. The modified
   electrode can potentially be harnessed for further electrochemical
   biosensor applications. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Blood is one of the most crucial biological materials that can be used
   to diagnose diseases. In order to avoid the effects of blood cells for
   cell free plasma detection, the first step toward a blood test is the
   blood separation. We developed a microfluidic chip for blood plasma
   separation with gradual filtration, which consisted of front-end cell
   capture structures and back-end filters. Two types of filters were
   proposed: straight line filters and square wave filters. The cell
   capture structures and filters, fabricated on PDMS
   (polydimethylsiloxane), included two structural layers. The first layer
   consisted of pillars to create small gaps between the second layer and
   glass, which enabled the flow of the plasma through the capture
   structures while trapping the cells in the structures. The second layer
   was an array of U-shaped structures. The results showed that the
   separation efficiency of plasma enhanced with increased dilution factor
   and decreased height of the gap created by the pillar layer. The
   separation efficiency was only 20\% under 2 mu m gap and dilution factor
   10 and increased to 91\% under the gap of 1 mu m height and dilution
   factor 50 in the chip with the straight line filters. The separation
   efficiency was close to 100\% under the gap of 1 mu m height and
   dilution factor 20 in the chip with the square wave filters. (C) 2014

Title = {{Short-range correlations in percolation at criticality}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{We derive the critical nearest-neighbor connectivity g(n) as 3/4, 3(7 -
   9p(c)(tri))/4(5 - p4(c)(tri)), and 3(2 + 7p(c)(tri))/4(5 - p(c)(tri))
   for bond percolation on the square, honeycomb, and triangular lattice,
   respectively, where p(c)(tri) = 2 sin(pi/18) is the percolation
   threshold for the triangular lattice, and confirm these values via Monte
   Carlo simulations. On the square lattice, we also numerically determine
   the critical next-nearest-neighbor connectivity as g(nn) = 0.687 500
   0(2), which confirms a conjecture by Mitra and Nienhuis {[}J. Stat.
   Mech. (2004) P10006], implying the exact value g(nn) = 11/16. We also
   determine the connectivity on a free surface as g(n)(surf) = 0.625 000
   1(13) and conjecture that this value is exactly equal to 5/8. In
   addition, we find that at criticality, the connectivities depend on the
   linear finite size L as similar to Lyt-d, and the associated
   specific-heat-like quantities C-n and C-nn scale as similar to L2yt-d
   ln(L/L-0), where d is the lattice dimensionality, y(t) = 1/nu the
   thermal renormalization exponent, and L-0 a nonuniversal constant. We
   provide an explanation of this logarithmic factor within the theoretical
   framework reported recently by Vasseur et al. {[}J. Stat. Mech. (2012)

Abstract = {{This paper explores the urban carbon cycle from the natural sciences
   perspective, identifying key knowledge gaps and priority areas for
   future research. The combination of large, concentrated carbon fluxes
   and rapid change makes cities key elements of the carbon cycle and
   offers the potential for them to serve as ``first responders{''} for
   climate action. Estimates of urban-scale carbon fluxes are significantly
   more uncertain than at larger spatial scales, in part because past
   studies have mostly avoided local/urban scales where the mix of
   anthropogenic and natural fluxes is complex and difficult to
   observationally isolate. To develop effective emission reduction
   policies, we need to understand emission sources and how they may be
   changing. Such improved quantification and understanding of underlying
   processes at the urban scale will not only provide policy-relevant
   information and improve the understanding of urban dynamics and future
   scenarios, but will also translate into better global-scale
   anthropogenic flux estimates, and advance our understanding of carbon
   cycle and climate feedbacks across multiple scales. Understanding the
   relationship between urbanization and urban carbon flows requires
   intellectual integration with research communities beyond the natural
   sciences. Cities can serve as interdisciplinary process laboratories
   that are sufficiently constrained in both spatial and governance scale
   to support truly integrated research by the natural sciences, social
   sciences, and engineering. A thoughtfully crafted science research
   agenda that is grounded in sustained, dense observations relevant to
   estimating urban carbon fluxes and their controlling processes and is
   focused on a statistically significant sample of cities will advance our
   understanding of the carbon cycle.}},

   adjusted to compensate for changes in mutual inductance that occur for
   variations of transmitter and receiver loop positions. Frequency-tuning
   is employed for a range of distances over which the loops are strongly
   coupled. In contrast, the impedance-tuned system employs varactor-based
   matching networks to compensate for changes in mutual inductance, and to
   achieve a simultaneous conjugate impedance match over a range of
   distances. The frequency-tuned system is simpler to implement, while the
   impedance-tuned system is more complex, but can achieve higher
   efficiencies. Both of the experimental wireless non-radiative
   power-transfer systems studied employ resonant shielded loops as
   transmitting and receiving devices.}},

Title = {{A Pilot Study of Diffusion-Weighted MRI in Patients Undergoing

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: In the current study we examined the ability of diffusion MRI
   (dMRI) to predict pathologic response in pancreatic cancer patients
   receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation. METHODS: We performed a
   prospective pilot study of dMRI in patients with resectable pancreatic
   cancer. Patients underwent dMRI prior to neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
   Surgical specimens were graded according to the percent tumor cell
   destruction. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were used to
   generate whole-tumor derived ADC histogram distributions and mean ADC
   values. The primary objective of the study was to correlate ADC
   parameters with pathologic and CT response. RESULTS: Ten of the 12
   patients enrolled on the study completed chemoradiation and had surgery.
   Three were found to be unresectable at the time of surgery and no
   specimen was obtained. Out of the 7 patients who underwent
   pancreaticoduodenectomy, 3 had a grade III histopathologic response
   (>90\% tumor cell destruction), 2 had a grade IIB response (51\% to 90\%
   tumor cell destruction), 1 had a grade IIA response (11\% to 50\% tumor
   cell destruction), and 1 had a grade I response (>90\% viable tumor).
   Median survival for patients with a grade III response, grade I-II
   response, and unresectable disease were 25.6, 18.7, and 6.1 months,
   respectively. There was a significant correlation between pre-treatment
   mean tumor ADC values and the amount of tumor cell destruction after
   chemoradiation with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.94 (P =
   .001). Mean pre-treatmentADC was 161x10(-5) mm(2)/s (n=3) in responding
   patients (>90\% tumor cell destruction) compared to 125x10(-5) mm(2)/s
   (n = 4) in non-responding patients (>10\% viable tumor). CT imaging
   showed no significant change in tumor size in responders or
   non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: dMRI may be useful to predict response to
   chemoradiation in pancreatic cancer. In our study, tumors with a low ADC
   mean value at baseline responded poorly to standard chemoradiation and
   would be candidates for intensified therapy.}},

Abstract = {{A concise review of the active control approaches for vibration
   reduction in rotorcraft is presented. Next, the evolution and status of
   higher harmonic control and pitch link actuated individual blade control
   is presented since these serve as the foundations of on blade control.
   Despite the success of these approaches, demonstrated by both full-scale
   wind tunnel and flight tests, higher harmonic control and pitch link
   actuated individual blade control have not managed to earn their way
   onto a production helicopter. An alternative, on blade control, is
   defined as a special implementation of individual blade control, where
   the control surfaces are located on the rotating blade and each blade
   has its own controller. A concise description of four on blade devices:
   (1) the actively controlled flap, (2) the active twist rotor, (3) the
   active tip rotor, and the (4) deployable Gurney flap, or microflap, is
   presented. An outline of an aeroelastic response modeling capability
   used to simulate active vibration and noise reduction using flaps or
   microflaps is presented. The simulation is a thread that links the
   various parts of the paper. Next, selected results from simulations and
   scale wind tunnel model tests on active flaps are used to provide
   insight on the operational and modeling aspects of these systems.
   Full-scale wind tunnel and flight tests are presented as culmination of
   the research effort invested in active flap rotors. Then, the evolution
   and application of the active twist rotor, and deployable Gurney flaps,
   or microflaps, is presented. The paper concludes with lessons learned
   and speculation about the potential implementation of on blade control
   on production rotorcraft.}},

Abstract = {{Bench-scale, batch experiments exploring algae hydrothermal liquefaction
   typically use organic solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM) to recover
   biocrude from the reactor contents. Commercial-scale, continuous
   processes, however, may separate biocrude and the aqueous phase
   co-product without solvent use. Herein, we provide the first thorough
   examination of the influence of DCM extraction on biocrude yield and
   composition from microalgae liquefaction in hot compressed water (350
   degrees C, 20 min). We provide gravimetric biocrude yields and biocrude
   characterization via elemental analysis, GC-MS, NMR, and IR
   spectroscopies. The application of DCM increases the biocrude yield
   because it extracts water-soluble compounds from the aqueous phase
   co-product. Indeed, the biocrude recovered from the aqueous phase
   accounted for about 8 wt\% of the total amount of biocrude. The addition
   of these molecules diminishes the biocrude quality, however, by
   decreasing the C and H content, increasing the O and N content, and
   thereby decreasing the higher heating value of the biocrude. The
   biocrude extracted from the aqueous phase had a remarkably different
   elemental composition than did the biocrude recovered without solvent.
   The O and N contents were more than twice as high, and the higher
   heating value was 20\% lower. The biocrudes recovered directly from
   hydrothermal liquefaction (e.g., without water and DCM coming into
   contact) were 87\%-88\% C and H, and possessed a higher heating value of
   >39 MJ/kg. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of dynamic properties of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is
   essential for seismic response analysis of MSW landfills in areas of
   moderate to high seismicity. A field testing program aimed at
   characterizing the dynamic properties of MSW was executed at two
   locations in a Subtitle D landfill in Austin, Texas. Shear and primary
   wave velocities were measured using small-scale crosshole and downhole
   seismic tests. The combination of these seismic methods allowed an
   assessment of the effect of waste composition on dynamic properties,
   anisotropy, and Poisson's ratio of the MSW. In addition, steady-state
   dynamic testing was performed using two mobile vibroseis shakers to
   evaluate in-situ the nonlinear relationship between shear modulus and
   shearing strain. Horizontal steady-state shaking at increasing stress
   level generated shearing strains from 0.001\% to 0.2\% allowing
   evaluation of shear modulus reduction curves over a wide shearing strain
   range. The effect of confining stress on the dynamic properties of the
   MSW was also evaluated using the substantial weight of the vibroseis as
   reaction to apply surcharge vertical loads at the surface of the MSW.

Abstract = {{Measurement of network performance in complex WiFi networks, such as in
   corporations and universities, is an important but challenging task, as
   wireless performance in networks with many access points is hard to
   measure and model. We demonstrate that crowdsourcing the task of
   measuring WiFi performance is an effective solution to this problem. By
   measuring performance directly with unmodified consumer mobile devices
   such as smartphones, it is possible to cheaply and easily detect
   problems that matter to users. Aggregated performance data across
   clients can then provide a global view of performance trends in an
   enterprise network. We demonstrate that periodic sampling allows the
   collection of representative data while keeping battery consumption low,
   and we leverage mobile sensor information to intelligently schedule
   these measurements. This system was deployed in two different large
   WLANs, where we discovered numerous previously undetected performance
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{In the classical broadcast scheduling problem, there are n pages stored
   at a server, and requests for these pages arrive over time. Whenever a
   page is broadcast, it satisfies all outstanding requests for that page.
   The objective is to minimize average flow time of the requests. For any
   epsilon > 0, we give a (1 + epsilon)-speed O(1/epsilon(3))competitive
   online algorithm for broadcast scheduling. This improves over the recent
   breakthrough result of Im and Moseley {[}2010], where they obtained a (1
   + epsilon)-speed O(1/epsilon(11))-competitive algorithm. Our algorithm
   and analysis are considerably simpler than Im and Moseley {[}2010]. More
   importantly, our techniques also extend to the general setting of
   nonuniform page sizes and dependent requests. This is the first scalable
   algorithm for broadcast scheduling with varying size pages and resolves
   the main open question from Im and Moseley {[}2010].}},

Abstract = {{Microscopic residual bubble nuclei can persist on the order of 1 s
   following a cavitation event. These bubbles can limit the efficacy of
   ultrasound therapies such as shock wave lithotripsy and histotripsy,
   because they attenuate pulses that arrive subsequent to their formation
   and seed repetitive cavitation activity at a discrete set of sites
   (cavitation memory). Here, we explore a strategy for the removal of
   these residual bubbles following a cavitation event, using low-amplitude
   ultrasound pulses to stimulate bubble coalescence. All experiments were
   conducted in degassed water and monitored using high-speed photography.
   In each case, a 2-MHz histotripsy transducer was used to initiate
   cavitation activity (a cavitational bubble cloud), the collapse of which
   generated a population of residual bubble nuclei. This residual nuclei
   population was then sonicated using a 1 ms pulse from a separate 500-kHz
   transducer, which we term the bubble removal pulse. Bubble removal pulse
   amplitudes ranging from 0 to 1.7 MPa were tested, and the backlit area
   of shadow from bubbles remaining in the field following bubble removal
   was calculated to quantify efficacy. It was found that an ideal
   amplitude range exists (roughly 180 to 570 kPa) in which bubble removal
   pulses stimulate the aggregation and subsequent coalescence of residual
   bubble nuclei, effectively removing them from the field. Further
   optimization of bubble removal pulse sequences stands to provide an
   adjunct to cavitation-based ultrasound therapies such as shock wave
   lithotripsy and histotripsy, mitigating the effects of residual bubble
   nuclei that currently limit their efficacy.}},

Journal = {{LIGHT-SCIENCE \& APPLICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Most current solar panels are fabricated via complex processes using
   expensive semiconductor materials, and they are rigid and heavy with a
   dull, black appearance. As a result of their non-aesthetic appearance
   and weight, they are primarily installed on rooftops to minimize their
   negative impact on building appearance. The large surfaces and interiors
   of modern buildings are not efficiently utilized for potential electric
   power generation. Here, we introduce dual-function solar cells based on
   ultrathin dopant-free amorphous silicon embedded in an optical cavity
   that not only efficiently extract the photogenerated carriers but also
   display distinctive colors with the desired angle-insensitive
   appearances. Light-energy-harvesting colored signage is demonstrated.
   Furthermore, a cascaded photovoltaics scheme based on tunable spectrum
   splitting can be employed to increase power efficiency by absorbing a
   broader band of light energy. This study pioneers a new approach to
   architecturally compatible and decorative thin-film photovoltaics.}},

Abstract = {{An SiGe transmit-receive phased-array chip has been developed for
   automotive radar applications at 76-84 GHz. The chip is based on an
   all-RF beamforming approach and contains 8-transmit channels, 8-receive
   channels, and a complete built-in-self-test system. Two high-linearity
   quadrature mixers with an input P-1dB of +2.5 dBm are used and allow
   simultaneous sum and difference patterns in the receive mode. The chip
   operates in either a narrowband frequency-modulated continuous-wave
   (FMCW) mode or a wideband mode with >2-GHz bandwidth. A high-linearity
   design results in an input P-1dB of -10 dBm (per channel), a system
   noise figure of 16-18 dB, and a transmit power is 4-5 dBm (per channel).
   The chip uses a controlled collapse chip connection (C4) bumping process
   and is flip-chipped on a low-cost printed-circuit board, and results in
   >50-dB isolation between the transmit and receive chains. To our
   knowledge, this work represents the state-of-the-art in terms of
   complexity at millimeter-wave frequencies and with simultaneous transmit
   and receive operation for high-performance FMCW radars.}},

Abstract = {{An oxide memristor device changes its internal state according to the
   history of the applied voltage and current. The principle of resistive
   switching (RS) is based on ion transport (e.g., oxygen vacancy
   redistribution). To date, devices with bi-, triple-, or even
   quadruple-layered structures have been studied to achieve the desired
   switching behavior through device structure optimization. In contrast,
   the device performance can also be tuned through fundamental
   atomic-level design of the switching materials, which can directly
   affect the dynamic transport of ions and lead to optimized switching
   characteristics. Here, we show that doping tantalum oxide memristors
   with silicon atoms can facilitate oxygen vacancy formation and transport
   in the switching layer with adjustable ion hopping distance and drift
   velocity. The devices show larger dynamic ranges with easier access to
   the intermediate states while maintaining the extremely high cycling
   endurance (>10(10) set and reset) and are well-suited for neuromorphic
   computing applications. As an example, we demonstrate different flavors
   of spike-timing-dependent plasticity in this memristor system. We
   further provide a characterization methodology to quantitatively
   estimate the effective hopping distance of the oxygen vacancies. The
   experimental results are confirmed through detailed ab initio
   calculations which reveal the roles of dopants and provide design
   methodology for further optimization of the RS behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Rough surface and poor stability of ultrathin Ag films limit their
   applications in nanophotonic and optoelectronic devices. Here, we report
   an approach for fabricating ultrasmooth and thermally stable Ag-based
   thin films on SiO2/Si substrates by Al-doping. The effect of Al-doping
   on the surface morphology and stability of ultrathin Ag films at room
   temperature and elevated temperature was investigated. The 15 nm
   Al-doped Ag films with an Al atomic concentration of 4\% have a
   root-mean-square roughness as low as 0.4 nm. The smooth surface
   morphology is maintained even after 300 degrees C annealing in N-2.
   Al-doping enhances the nuclei density of films. Moreover, a capping
   layer spontaneously formed over the Al-doped Ag films restrains the
   surface diffusion and mass transportation of Ag atoms. Therefore,
   Al-doping induces ultrathin Ag films with highly stable and ultrasmooth

Abstract = {{This paper considers continuous-time state estimation when part of the
   state estimate or the entire state estimate is norm-constrained. In the
   former case continuous-time state estimation is considered by posing a
   constrained optimization problem. The optimization problem can be broken
   up into two separate optimization problems, one which solves for the
   optimal observer gain associated with the unconstrained state estimates,
   while the other solves for the optimal observer gain associated with the
   constrained state estimates. The optimal constrained state estimate is
   found by projecting the time derivative of an unconstrained estimate
   onto the tangent space associated with the norm constraint. The special
   case where the entire state estimate is norm-constrained is briefly
   discussed. The utility of the filtering results developed are
   highlighted through a spacecraft attitude estimation example. Numerical
   simulation results are included. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper studies node cooperation in a wireless network from the MAC
   layer perspective. A simple relay channel with a source, a relay, and a
   destination node is considered where the source can transmit a packet
   directly to the destination or transmit through the relay. The tradeoff
   between average energy and delay is studied by posing the problem as a
   stochastic dynamical optimization problem. The following two cases are
   considered: 1) nodes are cooperative and information is decentralized,
   and 2) nodes are strategic and information is centralized. With
   decentralized information and cooperative nodes, a structural result is
   proven that the optimal policy is the solution of a Bellman-type
   fixed-point equation over a time invariant state space. For specific
   cost functions reflecting transmission energy consumption and average
   delay, numerical results are presented showing that a policy found by
   solving this fixed-point equation outperforms conventionally used
   time-division multiple access (TDMA) and random access (RA) policies.
   When nodes are strategic and information is common knowledge, it is
   shown that cooperation can be induced by exchange of payments between
   the nodes, imposed by the network designer such that the socially
   optimal Markov policy corresponding to the centralized solution is the
   unique subgame perfect equilibrium of the resulting dynamic game.}},

Abstract = {{Due to favorable material properties such as high atomic number (Tl: 81,
   Br: 35), high density (g/cm(3)), and a wide band gap (2.68 eV),
   thallium-bromide (TlBr) is currently under investigation for use as an
   alternative room-temperature semiconductor gamma-ray spectrometer. TlBr
   detectors can achieve less than 1\% FWHM energy resolution at 662 keV,
   but these results are limited to stable operation at -20 degrees C.
   After days to months of room-temperature operation, ionic conduction
   causes these devices to fail. This work correlates the varying leakage
   current with alpha-particle and gamma-ray spectroscopic performances at
   various operating temperatures. Depth-dependent photopeak centroids
   exhibit time-dependent transient behavior, which indicates trapping
   sites form near the anode surface during room-temperature operation.
   After refabrication, similar performance and functionality of failed
   detectors returned.}},

Abstract = {{Two 65 nm bulk complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) digital
   application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips were designed, and
   then tested in a heavy ion accelerator to characterize single-event
   effects (SEE). Test chip 1 incorporates test structures, and test chip 2
   implements an unhardened and a hardened digital signal processing (DSP)
   core. Our testing results reveal the radiation effects on the
   low-voltage and high-frequency operations of the ASIC chips. At a low
   supply voltage of 0.7 V, cross sections increase by a factor of 2 to 5
   at low linear energy transfer (LET), while the increase in cross section
   at high LET is almost negligible, suggesting that the charge conveyed by
   heavy ion has far exceeded the critical charge and tuning the supply
   voltage is not effective. Increasing the clock frequency increases the
   relative importance of single-event transients (SET) compared to
   single-event upsets (SEU), especially in hardened designs due to their
   better SEU immunity. The hardened DSP core experiences a factor of 2
   increase in cross section when its clock frequency is increased from 100
   MHz to 500 MHz.}},

   morphology evolution of different molecules based on processing
   conditions, coupled with the thermophysical and mechanical properties of
   the molecules. This experimental approach opens a path for exciting

Abstract = {{Mixed convection in a horizontal duct with imposed transverse horizontal
   magnetic field is studied using direct numerical simulations (DNS) and
   linear stability analysis. The duct's walls are electrically insulated
   and thermally insulated with the exception of the bottom wall, at which
   constant-rate heating is applied. The focus of the study is on flows at
   high Hartmann (Ha <= 800) and Grashof (Gr <= 10(9)) numbers. It is found
   that, while conventional turbulence is fully suppressed, the natural
   convection mechanism leads to the development of large-scale coherent
   structures. Two types of flows are found. One is the `low-Gr' regime, in
   which the structures are rolls aligned with the magnetic field and
   velocity and temperature fields are nearly uniform along the magnetic
   field lines outside of the boundary layers. Another is the `high-Gr'
   regime, in which the convection appears as a combination of similar
   rolls oriented along the magnetic field lines and streamwise-oriented
   rolls. In this case, velocity and temperature distributions are
   anisotropic, but three-dimensional.}},

Abstract = {{Forming functional blood vessel networks in engineered or ischemic
   tissues is a significant scientific and clinical hurdle. Poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels are adapted to investigate the role of
   mechanical properties and proteolytic susceptibility on vascularization.
   Four arm PEG vinyl sulfone is polymerized by Michael-type addition with
   cysteine groups on a slowly degraded matrix metalloprotease (MMP)
   susceptible peptide, GPQGIWGQ, or a more rapidly cleaved peptide,
   VPMSMRGG. Co-encapsulation of endothelial cells and supportive
   fibroblasts within the gels lead to vascular morphogenesis in vitro that
   is robust to changes in crosslinking peptide identity, but is
   significantly attenuated by increased crosslinking and MMP inhibition.
   Perfused vasculature forms from transplanted cells in vivo in all gel
   types; however, in contrast to the in vitro results, vascularization in
   vivo is not decreased in the more crosslinked gels. Collectively, these
   findings demonstrate the utility of this platform to support
   vascularization both in vitro and in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic medical records (EMR) and treatment plans are used in
   research on patient outcomes and radiation effects. In many situations
   researchers must remove protected health information (PHI) from EMRs.
   The literature contains several studies describing the anonymization of
   generic Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) files and
   DICOM image sets but no publications were found that discuss the
   anonymization of DICOM radiation therapy plans, a key component of an
   EMR in a cancer clinic. In addition to this we were unable to find a
   commercial software tool that met the minimum requirements for
   anonymization and preservation of data integrity for radiation therapy
   research. The purpose of this study was to develop a prototype software
   code to meet the requirements for the anonymization of radiation therapy
   treatment plans and to develop a way to validate that code and
   demonstrate that it properly anonymized treatment plans and preserved
   data integrity. We extended an open-source code to process all relevant
   PHI and to allow for the automatic anonymization of multiple EMRs. The
   prototype code successfully anonymized multiple treatment plans in less
   than 1 min/patient. We also tested commercial optical character
   recognition (OCR) algorithms for the detection of burned-in text on the
   images, but they were unable to reliably recognize text. In addition, we
   developed and tested an image filtering algorithm that allowed us to
   isolate and redact alphanumeric text from a test radiograph. Validation
   tests verified that PHI was anonymized and data integrity, such as the
   relationship between DICOM unique identifiers (UID) was preserved. (C)

Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{411-418}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a long-term cost analysis of wind power and compares
   its competitiveness to non-renewable generating technologies. The
   analysis considers several important attributes related to wind
   intermittency that are sometimes ignored in traditional generation
   planning or LCOE (levelized cost of energy) studies, including the need
   for more nameplate capacity due to intermittency, hourly fluctuations in
   wind outputs and cost for reserves. The competitiveness of wind power is
   assessed by evaluating four scenarios: 1) adding natural gas generating
   capacity to the power grid; 2) adding coal generating capacity to the
   power grid; 3) adding wind capacity to the power grid; and, 4) adding
   wind capacity and energy storage to the power grid where an energy
   storage device is used to cover wind intermittency. A case study in the
   state of Michigan is presented to demonstrate the use of the proposed
   methodology, in which a time horizon from 2010 to 2040 is considered.
   The results show that wind energy will still be more expensive than
   natural gas power plants in the next three decades, but will be cheaper
   than coal capacities if wind intermittency is mitigated. Furthermore, if
   the costs of carbon emissions and environmental externalities are
   considered, wind generation will be a competitive option for grid
   capacity expansion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Study of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) resolution degradation in 2-D
   sparse random medium composed of electrically large dielectric cylinders
   with possibly high index of refraction is presented. This study is
   motivated by the need for better understanding of focusing capabilities
   of SAR systems through random media at submillimeter wave (sub-MMW)
   frequencies. Analytical recursive expressions are derived to predict the
   coherence of the transmitted wave as a function of the propagation
   distance due to different source locations as well as same source
   location but different operating frequencies. These expressions are
   directly related to the cross-range and range resolution of the SAR
   system operating in random media, respectively. Furthermore, by invoking
   the memory effect property of translational invariant random media, an
   efficient algorithm is developed to analytically evaluate the coherence
   functions. The formulations are based on a newly developed coherent wave
   propagation model, called Statistical S-matrix for wave propagation in
   spectral domain (SSWaP-SD). A full-wave numerical model in conjunction
   with Monte Carlo simulations is used to validate the analytical
   expressions for the coherence. Finally, full wave simulation of a SAR
   imaging scenario is presented, and a simple method is proposed to reduce
   the image speckle level without sacrificing the resolution.}},

Abstract = {{The ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm
   approximates the gradient of a likelihood function using a subset of
   projections instead of using all projections so that fast image
   reconstruction is possible for emission and transmission tomography such
   as SPECT, PET, and CT. However, OSEM does not significantly accelerate
   reconstruction with computationally expensive regularizers such as
   patch-based nonlocal (NL) regularizers, because the regularizer gradient
   is evaluated for every subset. We propose to use variable splitting to
   separate the likelihood term and the regularizer term for penalized
   emission tomographic image reconstruction problem and to optimize it
   using the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). We also
   propose a fast algorithm to optimize the ADMM parameter based on
   convergence rate analysis. This new scheme enables more sub-iterations
   related to the likelihood term. We evaluated our ADMM for 3-D SPECT
   image reconstruction with a patch-based NL regularizer that uses the
   Fair potential function. Our proposed ADMM improved the speed of
   convergence substantially compared to other existing methods such as
   gradient descent, EM, and OSEM using De Pierro's approach, and the

Abstract = {{Parallel excitation requires fast and accurate map estimation.
   Bloch-Siegert (BS) B-1 mapping is very fast and accurate over a large
   dynamic range. When applied to multi-coil systems, however, this
   phase-based method may produce low signal-to-noise ratio estimates in
   low magnitude regions due to localized excitation patterns of parallel
   excitation systems. Also, the imaging time increases with the number of
   coils. In this work, we first propose to modify the standard BS B-1
   mapping sequence so that it avoids the scans required by previous B-1
   phase estimation methods. A regularized method is then proposed to
   jointly estimate the magnitude and phase of multi-coil B-1 maps from BS
   mapping data, improving estimation quality by using the prior knowledge
   of the smoothness of B-1 magnitude and phase. Lastly, we use Cramer-Rao
   lower bound analysis to optimize the coil combinations, to improve the
   quality of the raw data for B-1 estimation. The proposed methods are
   demonstrated by simulations and phantom experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Subunit vaccination benefits from improved safety over attenuated or
   inactivated vaccines, but their limited capability to elicit
   long-lasting, concerted cellular and humoral immune responses is a major
   challenge. Recent studies have demonstrated that antigen delivery via
   nanoparticle formulations can significantly improve immunogenicity of
   vaccines due to either intrinsic immunostimulatory properties of the
   materials or by co-entrapment of molecular adjuvants such as Toll-like
   receptor agonists. These studies have collectively shown that
   nanoparticles designed to mimic biophysical and biochemical cues of
   pathogens offer new exciting opportunities to enhance activation of
   innate immunity and elicit potent cellular and humoral immune responses
   with minimal cytotoxicity. In this review, we present key research
   advances that were made within the last 5 years in the field of
   nanoparticle vaccine delivery systems. In particular, we focus on the
   impact of biomaterials composition, size, and surface charge of
   nanoparticles on modulation of particle biodistribution, delivery of
   antigens and immunostimulatory molecules, trafficking and targeting of
   antigen presenting cells, and overall immune responses in systemic and
   mucosal tissues. This review describes recent progresses in the design
   of nanoparticle vaccine delivery carriers, including liposomes,
   lipid-based particles, micelles and nanostructures composed of natural
   or synthetic polymers, and lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Pax genes belong to a family of metazoan transcription factors that are
   known to play a critical role in eye, ear, kidney and neural
   development. The mammalian Pax family of transcription factors is
   characterized by a similar to 128-amino-acid DNA-binding paired domain
   that makes sequence-specific contacts with DNA. The diversity in Pax
   gene activities emerges from complex modes of interaction with enhancer
   regions and heterodimerization with multiple interaction partners. Based
   on in vitro optimal binding-site selection studies and enhancer
   identification assays, it has been suggested that Pax proteins may
   recognize and bind their target DNA elements with different binding
   modes/topologies, however this hypothesis has not yet been structurally
   explored. One of the most extensively studied DNA target elements of the
   Pax6 paired domain is the eye-lens specific DC5 (delta-crystallin)
   enhancer element. In order to shed light on Pax6-DC5 DNA interactions,
   the related paired-domain prototype Pax9 was crystallized with the
   minimal delta-crystallin DC5 enhancer element and preliminary X-ray
   diffraction analysis was attempted. A 3.0 angstrom resolution native
   data set was collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS),
   Brookhaven from crystals grown in a solution consisting of 10\%(w/v) PEG
   20K, 20\%(v/v) PEG 550 MME, 0.03 M NaNO3, 0.03 M Na2HPO4, 0.03 M NH2SO4,
   0.1 M MES/imidazole pH 6.5. The data set was indexed and merged in space
   group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a=75.74, b=165.59, c=70.14
   angstrom, alpha=beta=gamma=90 degrees. The solvent content in the unit
   cell is consistent with the presence of one Pax9 paired domain bound to
   duplex DNA in the asymmetric unit.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Predicting trajectories of signaling networks under complex
   perturbations is one of the most valuable, but challenging, tasks in
   systems biology. Signaling networks are involved in most of the
   biological pathways, and modeling their dynamics has wide applications
   including drug design and treatment outcome prediction.
   Results: In this paper, we report a novel model for predicting the cell
   type-specific time course response of signaling proteins under unseen
   perturbations. This algorithm achieved the top performance in the 2013
   8th Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM 8)
   subchallenge: time course prediction in breast cancer cell lines. We
   formulate the trajectory prediction problem into a standard
   regularization problem; the solution becomes solving this discrete
   ill-posed problem. This algorithm includes three steps: denoising,
   estimating regression coefficients and modeling trajectories under
   unseen perturbations. We further validated the accuracy of this method
   against simulation and experimental data. Furthermore, this method
   reduces computational time by magnitudes compared to state-of-the-art
   methods, allowing genome-wide modeling of signaling pathways and time
   course trajectories to be carried out in a practical time.}},

Abstract = {{This work explores the implications of a constitutive framework that
   introduces a particular remodelling process for materials having a
   continuous distribution of fibre directions. It is assumed that the
   matrix constituent is unaffected and that fibres remodel by a process of
   dissolution and reassembly. Dissolution results from a time dependent
   chemical kinetic process that is influenced by fibre stretch. Two
   possibilities for the reassembly of the fibres are considered: (1)
   fibres reassemble in a stress-free state or (2) fibres assemble in a
   pre-strained state matching that of the surrounding matrix. The
   composite is treated as a non-linear hyperelastic material. The
   constitutive framework accounts for the time dependent redistribution of
   fibre orientation and density. A directional fibre orientation density
   function is defined that combines fibre dissolution, reassembly and
   their dependence on deformation history. Expressions for the time
   dependence of this function are developed for the two fibre reassembly
   assumptions and different deformation histories. Numerical results for
   uniaxial extension are presented in the form of polar plots that
   illustrate fibre orientation density at different times and fibre
   density versus time plots that show evolution at different orientations.}},

Title = {{Toward Better Use of Bone Scans Among Men With Early-stage Prostate

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance of published guidelines compared
   with that of current practice for radiographic staging of men with newly
   diagnosed prostate cancer.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS Using data from the Michigan Urological Surgery
   Improvement Collaborative clinical registry, we identified 1509 men
   diagnosed with prostate cancer from March 2012 through June 2013.
   Clinical data included age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level,
   Gleason score (GS), clinical trial stage, number of biopsy cores, and
   bone scan (BS) results. We then fit a multivariate logistic regression
   model to examine the association between clinical variables and the
   occurrence of bone metastases. Because some patients did not undergo BS,
   we used established methods to correct for verification bias and
   estimate the diagnostic accuracy of published guidelines.
   RESULTS Among 416 men who received a BS, 48 (11.5\%) had evidence of
   bone metastases. Patients with bone metastases were older, with higher
   PSA levels and GS (all P < .05). In multivariate analyses, PSA (P <.
   001) and GS (P = .004) were the only independent predictors of positive
   BS. Guidelines from the American Urological Association and the National
   Comprehensive Cancer Network demonstrated similar performance in
   detecting bone metastases in our population, with fewer negative study
   results than those of the European Association of Urology guideline.
   Applying the American Urological Association recommendations (ie, image
   when PSA level >20 ng/mL or GS >= 8) to current clinical practice, we
   estimate that <1\% of positive study results would be missed, whereas
   the number of negative study results would be reduced by 38\%.
   CONCLUSION Based on current practice patterns, more uniform application
   of existing guidelines would ensure that BS is performed for almost all
   men with bone metastases, while avoiding many negative imaging studies.

Abstract = {{Decarboxylation of fatty acids is a path to hydrocarbon fuels from
   renewable biomass resources. We explored the deactivation of Pt
   catalysts during the hydrothermal decarboxylation of butyric arid at 350
   degrees C and 3000 psi in a continuous flow reactor. DRIFTS spectra of
   the used catalyst showing characteristic absorptions at 2900 and 1500
   cm(-1) suggested that unsaturated hydrocarbons are responsible for
   catalyst poisoning. The restoration of appreciable catalyst activity due
   to controlled oxidation indicated that coke had formed during the
   decarboxylation experiment. BET measurements showed that the Vulcan
   XC-72R carbon support pore volume decreased from 1.41 to 0.55 cm(3)/g.
   Thus, a combination of poisoning, coking, and pore structure changes in
   the carbon support caused the Pt/C catalyst to deactivate over a period
   of 24 h on stream. The first-order deactivation rate constant for Pt/C
   was 0.063 +/- 0.006 h(-1). These results provide insight into
   interventions that may lead to prolonged catalyst activity for
   hydrothermal reactions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a recent study on weld residual stress relief
   mechanisms associated with furnace-based uniform post-weld heat
   treatment (PWHT). Both finite element and analytical methods are used to
   quantitatively examine how plastic deformation and creep relaxation
   contribute to residual stress relief process at different stages of PWHT
   process. The key contribution of this work to an improved understanding
   of furnace based uniform PWHT can be summarized as follows:
   (1) Plastic deformation induced stress relief during PWHT can be
   analytically expressed by the change in material elastic deformation
   capacity (or elastic deformation limit) measured in terms of material
   yield strength to Young's modulus ratio, which has a rather limited role
   in overall residual stress relief during furnace based uniform PWHT.
   (2) The most dominant stress relief mechanism is creep strain induced
   stress relaxation, as expected. However, a rapid creep strain
   development accompanied by a rapid residual stress reduction during
   heating stage before reaching PWHT temperature is shown to contribute to
   most of the stress relief seen in overall PWHT process, suggesting PWHT
   hold time can be significantly reduced as far as residual stress relief
   is concerned.
   (3) A simple engineering scheme for estimating residual stress reduction
   is proposed based on this study by relating material type, PWHT
   temperature, and component wall thickness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has proven its
   potential in locating and tracking construction resources, a critical
   task in construction project control. However, the main challenge is how
   to achieve desired levels of locating accuracy. This paper presents an
   enhanced boundary condition method that incorporates the tag-reader
   angle and the reader geometric configuration factors to control the
   accuracy of a locating system that integrates RFID and real time
   kinematic (RTK) global positioning system (GPS). Controlled laboratory
   experiments were conducted to assess their effects and create quality
   control filters. This study demonstrated the relationship between the
   detecting range and the tag-reader angle and used it to separate
   valid/invalid boundary points. Spatial dilution of precision (SDOP) was
   formulated to measure the geometric configuration of readers forming the
   boundary constraint. Correlating SDOP to the locating error through a
   polynomial regression model, a mechanism was created to use SDOP to
   predict and control the locating accuracy. Open field experiments
   validated that appropriate SDOP, and tag-reader angle filters could be
   created to achieve varying levels of accuracy. (C) 2014 American Society

   The model is applied to predict the behavior of 63Sn37Pb soldered

Abstract = {{This report describes the synthesis of amphiphilic copolymers (ABC-1 and
   ABC-2) composed of a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block, a
   central poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) block, and a random copolymer of
   heptadecafluorodecyl methacrylate (HDFMA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA)
   forming the hydrophobic block, which are used to form nanodroplets for
   ultrasound-mediated cell ablation. Specifically, the effect of molecular
   weight of PEG and P(HDFMA-co-MMA) blocks on polymer's ability to
   self-assemble around a variable amount (096, 1\%, and 296 v/v) of
   perfluoropentane (PFP) forming nanodroplets is investigated. The ability
   of different nanodroplets formulations embedded with a monolayer of red
   blood cells (RBCs) in tissue-mimicking agarose phantoms to initiate and
   sustain a bubble cloud in response to ultrasound treatments with
   different acoustic pressures and the associated ablation of RBCs were
   also investigated. Results show that ABC-1 polymer composed of a 2 kDa
   PEG block and a 6.7 kDa P(HDFMA-co-MMA) block better encapsulate the PFP
   core compared to ABC-2 polymer composed of a 5 kDa PEG block and 11.4
   kDa P(HDFMA-co-MMA) block. Further, the ablative capacity indicated by
   the damage area in the RBCs monolayer increased with the increase in PFP
   content and reached its maximum with the nanodroplets formulated using
   ABC-1 polymer and encapsulating w2\% v/v PFP. The nanodroplets
   formulated using ABC-1 polymer and loaded with 2\% PFP produced the
   cavitation cloud and exhibited their ablative effect at an acoustic
   pressure that is 2.5-fold lower than the acoustic pressure needed to
   generate the same effect using a histotripsy (ultrasound) pulse alone,
   which indicates the ability of these nanodroplets to achieve targeted
   and self-limiting fractionation of disease cells while sparing
   neighboring healthy ones. Results also show that effective nanodroplets
   maintained their size and concentration upon incubation with bovine
   serum albumin at 37 degrees C for 24 h, which indicates their stability
   in physiologic conditions and their promise for in vivo cancer cell
   ablation.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 40\% to 60\% of patients with
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) continue to experience symptoms
   despite adequate medical management. For this population of
   treatment-refractory patients, promising results have been reported with
   the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS).
   OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the literature and develop
   evidence-based guidelines on DBS for OCD.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search was undertaken using the PubMed
   database for articles published between 1966 and October 2012 combining
   the following words: ``deep brain stimulation and obsessive-compulsive
   disorder{''} or ``electrical stimulation and obsessive-compulsive
   disorder.{''} Of 353 articles, 7 were retrieved for full-text review and
   analysis. The quality of the articles was assigned to each study and the
   strength of recommendation graded according to the guidelines
   development methodology of the American Association of Neurological
   Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Joint Guidelines Committee.
   RESULTS: Of the 7 studies, 1 class I and 2 class II double-blind,
   randomized, controlled trials reported that bilateral DBS is more
   effective in improving OCD symptoms than sham treatment.
   CONCLUSION: Based on the data published in the literature, the following
   recommendations can be made: (1) There is Level I evidence, based on a
   single class I study, for the use of bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS
   for the treatment of medically refractory OCD. (2) There is Level II
   evidence, based on a single class II study, for the use of bilateral
   nucleus accumbens DBS for the treatment of medically refractory OCD. (3)
   There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for the use of
   unilateral DBS for the treatment of medically refractory OCD.}},

Abstract = {{Fast neutron interrogation for explosives detection has shown potential
   for the screening of sea-land cargo containers. Simulations were
   completed investigating the neutron scatter behavior of 14.1-MeV fast
   neutrons in such screening scenarios. Earlier efforts centered on Monte
   Carlo (MCNP5) simulations to identify flags or on specific calculations
   based on photons or neutrons produced as a result of fast neutron
   interaction that signal the presence of the explosive RDX (C2H6N6O6).
   Those simulations consisted of simplified target geometry; artificially
   collimated neutron source; and generalized organic, hydrogenous, or
   metallic types of cargo materials. In this study, the MCNP5 simulation
   was expanded to include a more accurate representation of the neutron
   source, target geometry, detector response, and realistic and varied
   container contents. The flags found using the earlier simulations were
   applied to the more realistic scenario models in order to determine the
   feasibility of the use of flags in a detection algorithm. Additional
   flags utilizing the simulated detector response were also investigated.
   The conditions under which specific flags were preferable were also
   examined. It was found that many flags performed well independent of the
   cargo type while others, such as those using only neutron backscatter,
   were more highly dependent on cargo type. Furthermore, many of the
   best-performing flags were those that did not require stringent neutron
   spectroscopy and would therefore be feasible with existing technology.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This study aimed to validate the mathematical Zernike pupil size
   scaling from bigger pupils to smaller pupils, and vice versa, by
   comparing the estimates of the Zernike coefficients with corresponding
   clinical measurements obtained at different pupil sizes.
   Methods The i.Profiler Plus (Carl Zeiss Vision, Inc, USA) was used to
   obtain measures of wavefront aberrations for two pupil sizes (3 mm and
   the maximum natural pupil size) from the right eyes of 28 visually
   normal subjects (mean {[}SD] age, 57 {[}7] years) whose maximum pupil
   size was greater than or equal to 5 mm without pharmacological dilation.
   Zernike coefficients were estimated for a 3-mm pupil size scaling down
   from the measured data of the maximum natural pupil size and, similarly,
   for the maximum pupil size scaling up from the measured data of the 3-mm
   pupil.
   Results The differences between the estimated and measured values were
   not significantly different (repeated-measures analysis of variance; p >
   0.05) over the range of pupil sizes examined, irrespective of whether
   the estimates were made by scaling up from a small pupil or scaling down
   from a large pupil. However, the difference between the measured and
   estimated coefficients was more variable and less systematic when
   scaling to a larger pupil size when compared with scaling to a smaller
   pupil size.
   Conclusions Estimation of ocular wavefront aberration coefficients
   either scaling down from large to smaller pupils or scaling up from
   smaller to large pupils provides estimates that are not significantly
   different from clinically measured values. However, when scaling up to a
   larger pupil size, the estimates are more variable. These findings have
   implications for pupil scaling on an individual basis, such as in cases
   of refractive surgery or when using pupil scaling to examine a clinical
   cohort.}},

Abstract = {{High-aspect-ratio wings present in very flexible aircraft can undergo
   large deformations, which results in significant changes in natural
   frequencies as well as in static and dynamic aeroelastic response. This
   geometric nonlinear behavior becomes an integral part of any aeroelastic
   analysis to be conducted in such class of vehicles. Aeroelastic scaling
   is an important way to study the aeroelastic behavior of aircraft, and
   it is an integral part in risk mitigation for aircraft development.
   However, the current aeroelastic scaling methodologies have focused on
   geometrically linear structures. This paper demonstrates a methodology
   for geometrically nonlinear aeroelastic scaling of very flexible
   aircraft. The known linear scaling factors and similarity rules are
   extended to address geometrically nonlinear aeroelastic scaling. A
   high-aspect-ratio flying wing in free flight is taken as an example to
   verify the new scaling procedure, and numerical studies are conducted
   using the University of Michigan's Nonlinear Aeroelastic Simulation
   Toolbox. Numerical results support the new approach for aeroelastic
   scaling of very flexible aircraft.}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2342-2354}},

Abstract = {{Hover-capable flapping-wing micro air vehicles are well suited for
   missions in confined spaces. The best design practices for flapping
   wings and their kinematics are largely unknown, especially for flexible
   wings. To address this issue, numerical optimization is applied to the
   design of the kinematics and structural sizing of a flapping wing using
   a surrogate-based approach. The surrogates are generated using kriging
   interpolation of the time-averaged thrust generated and power required
   by the wings. The thrust and power data are computed using a nonlinear
   approximate aeroelastic model developed in previous studies by the
   authors. A numerical optimization algorithm is used to identify designs
   that produce the desired combination of thrust and power. The design
   variables consist of parameters describing the flap-pitch kinematics and
   the stiffness of the flexible wings. A trend study of thrust and power
   indicate that the phase angle between flap and pitch motions
   significantly affects the wing performance when the stroke amplitudes
   and the frequency are fixed. Smaller amounts of pitch actuation produced
   peak thrust in flexible wings when compared to the rigid wings. Several
   flexible configurations produce higher thrust when compared to the best
   thrust-producing rigid configuration. However, rigid wings have higher
   propulsive efficiency when compared to flexible wings for the same
   amount of generated thrust. Thus, the actual design of a flapping wing
   will depend on the relative importance given to thrust production and
   propulsive efficiency.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{A simple method to cryogenically preserve hepatocyte monolayers is
   currently not available but such a technique would facilitate numerous
   applications in the field of biomedical engineering, cell line
   development, and drug screening. We investigated the effect of trehalose
   and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) in cryopreservation of human
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells in suspension and monolayer
   formats. HepG2 cell monolayers were incubated for 24 h at varying
   concentrations of trehalose (50-150 mM) prior to cryopreservation to
   identify the optimum concentration for such preincubation. When
   trehalose alone was used as the cryoprotective agent (CPA), cells in
   monolayer format did not survive freezing while cells in suspension
   demonstrated 14\% viability 24 h after thawing. Only 6-13\% of cells in
   monolayers survived freezing in cell culture medium supplemented with
   10\% Me2SO, but 42\% of cells were recovered successfully if monolayers
   were preincubated with 100 mM trehalose prior to freezing in the Me2SO
   supplemented medium. Interestingly, for cells frozen in suspension in
   presence of 10\% Me2SO, metabolic activity immediately following thawing
   did not change appreciably compared to unfrozen control cells. Finally,
   Raman spectroscopy techniques were employed to evaluate ice
   crystallization in the presence and absence of trehalose in freezing
   solutions without cells because crystallization may alter the extent of
   injury observed in cell monolayers. We speculate that biomimetic
   approaches of using protective sugars to preserve cells in monolayer
   format will facilitate the development of techniques for long-term
   preservation of human tissues and organs in the future. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Low and heterogeneous delivery of drugs and imaging agents to tumors
   results in decreased efficacy and poor imaging results. Systemic
   delivery involves a complex interplay of drug properties and
   physiological factors, and heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment
   makes predicting and overcoming these limitations exceptionally
   difficult. Theoretical models have indicated that there are four
   different classes of pharmacokinetic behavior in tissue, depending on
   the fundamental steps in distribution. In order to study these limiting
   behaviors, we used multichannel fluorescence microscopy and stitching of
   high-resolution images to examine the distribution of four agents in the
   same tumor microenvironment. A validated generic partial differential
   equation model with a graphical user interface was used to select
   fluorescent agents exhibiting these four classes of behavior, and the
   imaging results agreed with predictions. BODIPY-FL exhibited higher
   concentrations in tissue with high blood flow, cetuximab gave
   perivascular distribution limited by permeability, high plasma protein
   and target binding resulted in diffusion-limited distribution for
   Hoechst 33342, and Integrisense 680 was limited by the number of binding
   sites in the tissue. Together, the probes and simulations can be used to
   investigate distribution in other tumor models, predict tumor drug
   distribution profiles, and design and interpret in vivo experiments. (c)

   predictions of ablative heat shields. The Stardust sample return capsule
   at four different trajectory conditions is used as a representative
   environment for Earth entry. In the first part of the study, the results
   predicted using Wilke's missing rule, with species viscosities
   calculated using Blottner's curve fits and species thermal
   conductivities determined using Eucken's relation, are compared to the
   results obtained using Gupta's mixing rule with collision cross-section
   data. The heat transfer to the vehicle predicted using the
   Wilke/Blottner/Eucken model is found to be larger than the value
   obtained using the Gupta/collision cross-section model by as much as
   60\%. The Wilke/Blottner/Eucken model also produces a larger mass
   blowing rate due to the oxidation of bulk carbon by as much as 25\%
   compared to the Gupta/collision cross-section model. In the second part
   of the study, the effects of the mass diffusion model are assessed using
   the Fick's, modified Fick's, self-consistent effective binary diffusion,
   and Stefan-Maxwell models. The results show that the flowfield
   properties calculated using the modified Fick's, self-consistent

Abstract = {{A novel vibration source separation and identification method using the
   denoising source separation (DSS) technique is proposed for the mixed
   mechanical vibration signals from engines in ships. Denoising source
   separation enables us to extract the source signals from the mixed
   signals without prior knowledge of sources and their mixing mode, and
   thus the important source information extracted by DSS can be used to
   monitor or actively control engine noises. Different denoising functions
   such as energy, skew, kurtosis, and tangential functions in DSS are
   applied to both simulation studies and experimental data to evaluate
   their separating performances. The tangential function provides the best
   outperformance with both numerical study and engineering application. In
   addition, the effectiveness of the proposed DSS method is validated by
   correlation analysis and the frequency marker tracking method.}},

Abstract = {{Capping protein (CP) binds the fast growing barbed end of the actin
   filament and regulates actin assembly by blocking the addition and loss
   of actin subunits. Recent studies provide new insights into how CP and
   barbed-end capping are regulated. Filament elongation factors, such as
   formins and ENA/VASP (enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein),
   indirectly regulate CP by competing with CP for binding to the barbed
   end, whereas other molecules, including V-1 and phospholipids, directly
   bind to CP and sterically block its interaction with the filament. In
   addition, a diverse and unrelated group of proteins interact with CP
   through a conserved `capping protein interaction' (CPI) motif. These
   proteins, including CARMIL (capping protein, ARP2/3 and myosin I
   tinker), CD2AP (CD2-associated protein) and the WASH (WASP and SCAR
   homologue) complex subunit FAM21, recruit CP to specific subcellular
   locations and modulate its actin-capping activity via allosteric
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{Intermediate band solar cell provides novel alternative to
   multi-junction solar cell, but its efficiency is significantly degraded
   when spectral overlap exists between different absorption bands. Here, a
   scheme using non-uniform sub-bandgap state filling together with
   intermediate band transport is proposed to resolve the spectral overlap
   issue. On the basis of detailed balance calculation, spectrally
   decoupled devices using low-high state filling is shown to achieve
   52.8\% conversion efficiency when 4eV spectral overlap is present
   between absorption coefficients of different bands, compared with
   baseline efficiency equal to 35.1\% for conventional half-filled
   intermediate band devices. If a base material without intermediate band
   is added to the two section low-high state filling devices, the
   efficiency is further increased to 61.5\%, which approaches efficiency
   of 63.2\% for intermediate band devices with no spectral overlap and
   63.8\% for unconstrained triple-junction tandem cells. The junction
   thermalization loss associated with proposed new structures is shown to
   be equal to conventional half-filled intermediate band devices.

Title = {{Evaluation of toluene LIF thermometry detection strategies applied in an

Abstract = {{In the context of toluene laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) thermometry,
   the two common LIF detection strategies, namely one-color and two-color
   detection, have been simultaneously applied to compare each strategy's
   ability to accurately resolve thermal gradients during an engine cycle
   within an optically accessible internal combustion (IC) engine.
   Temperature images are obtained from high-speed toluene LIF measurements
   and are combined with high-speed particle image velocimetry. The
   combination with flow data and Mie scattering images facilitates the
   interpretation of differences between the toluene LIF detection
   strategies. Two-color temperature images are limited in their ability to
   detect thermal gradients near the end of compression due to larger
   precision uncertainties. Local regions of cold gases in the two-color
   images are better identified with the guidance of the one-color images
   when homogeneous toluene mixtures preside. During expansion, large
   differences exist between one- and two-color temperature images and
   likely caused by local mixture fraction heterogeneities that bias the
   one-color detection strategy. Toluene condensation occurs during the
   expansion and exhaust stroke and causes local mixture fraction
   heterogeneities in the combustion chamber. Liquid toluene is in contact
   with solid surfaces and crevices of the combustion chamber and can
   evaporate during compression or expansion causing both local temperature
   and mixture stratification. This work demonstrates the advantage of
   high-speed imaging and use of multiple image diagnostics to reveal the
   development of natural temperature and mixture stratification in a
   motored IC engine. This work also suggests that natural temperature
   stratification typically regarded from gas-wall heat transfer may also
   be caused by liquid droplet evaporation on solid surfaces. Such
   phenomenon, however, is expected to be pertinent for all modern-day
   engine operating systems.}},

Abstract = {{Robust high-dimensional data processing has witnessed an exciting
   development in recent years. Theoretical results have shown that it is
   possible using convex programming to optimize data fit to a low-rank
   component plus a sparse outlier component. This problem is also known as
   robust PCA, and it has found application in many areas of computer
   vision. In image and video processing and face recognition, the
   opportunity to process massive image databases is emerging as people
   upload photo and video data online in unprecedented volumes. However,
   data quality and consistency is not controlled in any way, and the
   massiveness of the data poses a serious computational challenge. In this
   paper we present t-GRASTA, or ``Transformed GRASTA (Grassmannian robust
   adaptive subspace tracking algorithm){''}. t-GRASTA iteratively performs
   incremental gradient descent constrained to the Grassmann manifold of
   subspaces in order to simultaneously estimate three components of a
   decomposition of a collection of images: a low-rank subspace, a sparse
   part of occlusions and foreground objects, and a transformation such as
   rotation or translation of the image. We show that t-GRASTA is 4x faster
   than state-of-the-art algorithms, has half the memory requirement, and
   can achieve alignment for face images as well as jittered camera
   surveillance images. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In cystoceles, the distal anterior vaginal wall (AVW) bulges out through
   the introitus and is no longer in contact with the posterior vaginal
   wall or perineal body, exposing the pressure differential between
   intra-abdominal pressure and atmospheric pressure. The goal of this
   study is to quantify the length of the exposed vaginal wall length and
   to investigate its relationship with other factors associated with the
   AVW support, such as most dependent bladder location, apical location,
   and hiatus diameter, demonstrating its key role in cystocele formation.
   Fifty women were selected to represent a full spectrum of AVW support.
   Each underwent supine, dynamic MR imaging. Most dependent bladder
   location and apical location were measured relative to the average
   normal position on the mid-sagittal plane using the Pelvic Inclination
   Correction System . The length of the exposed AVW and the hiatus
   diameter were measured as well. The relationship between exposed AVW and
   most dependent bladder location, apical location, and hiatus diameter
   were examined.
   A bilinear relationship has been observed between exposed vaginal wall
   length and most dependent bladder location (R-2 = 0.91, P < 0.001). When
   the bladder descents up to the inflection point (about 4.4 cm away from
   its normal position), there is little change in the exposed AVW length.
   With further descent, the exposed vaginal wall length increases
   significantly, with a 2 cm increase in exposed AVW length for every
   additional 1 cm of drop bladder location. A similar but weaker bilinear
   relationship exists between exposed AVW and apical location. Exposed
   vaginal wall length is also highly correlated with hiatus diameter (R-2
   = 0.85, P < 0.001).
   A bilinear relationship exists between exposed vaginal wall length and
   most dependent bladder location and apical location. It is when the
   bladder descent is beyond the inflection point that exposed vaginal wall
   length increases significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Aerosolized delivery of antibiotics is hindered by poor
   penetration within distal and plugged airways. Antibacterial
   perfluorocarbon ventilation (APV) is a proposed solution in which the
   lungs are partially or totally filled with perfluorocarbon (PFC)
   containing emulsified antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate emulsion stability and rheological, antibacterial, and
   pharmacokinetic characteristics.
   Methods: This study examined emulsion aqueous droplet diameter and
   number density over 24 hr and emulsion and neat PFC viscosity and
   surface tension. Additionally, Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm growth was
   measured after 2-hr exposure to emulsion with variable aqueous volume
   percentages (0.25, 1, and 2.5\%) and aqueous tobramycin concentrations
   (C-a=0.4, 4, and 40 mg/mL). Lastly, the time course of serum and
   pulmonary tobramycin concentrations was evaluated following APV and
   conventional aerosolized delivery of tobramycin in rats.
   Results: The initial aqueous droplet diameter averaged 1.9 +/- 0.2 mu m
   with little change over time. Initial aqueous droplet number density
   averaged 3.5 +/- 1.7 x 10(9) droplets/mL with a significant (p < 0.01)
   decrease over time. Emulsion and PFC viscosity were not significantly
   different, averaging 1.22 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) Pa.sec. The surface tensions
   of PFC and emulsion were 15.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) and 14.6 +/- 0.6 x 10(-3)
   N/m, respectively, and the aqueous interfacial tensions were 46.7 +/-
   0.3 x 10(-3) and 26.9 +/- 11.0 x 10(-3) N/m (p < 0.01), respectively.
   Biofilm growth decreased markedly with increasing C-a and, to a lesser
   extent, aqueous volume percentage. Tobramycin delivered via APV yielded
   2.5 and 10 times larger pulmonary concentrations at 1 and 4 hr post
   delivery, respectively, and significantly (p < 0.05) lower serum
   concentrations compared with aerosolized delivery.
   Conclusions: The emulsion is bactericidal, retains the rheology
   necessary for pulmonary delivery, is sufficiently stable for this
   application, and results in increased pulmonary retention of the
   antibiotic.}},

Abstract = {{The liquid metal-cooling (LMC) directional-solidification process offers
   refinement of dendritic structure due to the increased cooling rate from
   enhanced heat extraction. However, under some conditions in the LMC
   process substantial lateral heat extraction occurs that leads to a
   change in dendrite morphology, resulting in grain nucleation or lateral
   growth-the formation of long secondary dendrite arms overgrowing
   favorably aligned primary dendrites. The conditions under which lateral
   growth occurs during solidification of alloys CMSX-486 and Rene-N4 have
   been studied experimentally and via solidification modeling.
   Solidification experiments have been conducted in a LMC furnace that
   utilizes liquid tin as the cooling medium and a floating ceramic baffle.
   A mold geometry was designed to evaluate a range of thermal conditions
   during solidification and assess the tendency for lateral growth.

Abstract = {{Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic steels are considered
   promising candidates as cladding tubes for Generation IV nuclear
   reactors. In such reactors, irradiation damage can reach more than 150
   dpa at temperatures ranging from 400 to 650 degrees C. Thus nanopartide
   stability has to be guaranteed in order to ensure that these materials
   possess excellent creep properties. Using Fe ions, ODS steels were
   irradiated at 500 degrees C up to 150 dpa. At this temperature the
   nano-oxide population evolution under irradiation is similar to that
   observed after annealing at high temperature. It consists of a slight
   increase in the particle size and a slight decrease in the density,
   which can be both explained by an Ostwald ripening mechanism.
   Conversely, irradiations performed at room temperature using Au ions
   lead to a complete dissolution of the oxide particles, in agreement with
   the estimation of ballistic vs. radiation enhanced diffusion effects.

Abstract = {{Experimental and numerical studies have been performed on the thermal
   and chemical effects of buffer gas composition on low temperature
   ignition of iso-octane and n-heptane. Experiments were conducted using a
   recently developed rapid compression machine in the temperature range of
   600-850 K. Three buffer gases were studied including nitrogen (N-2),
   argon (Ar), and a mixture of Ar and carbon dioxide (CO2) at a mole ratio
   of 65.1\%/34.9\%. Iso-octane was studied at 20 bar, phi = 1, and a
   dilution level of buffer gas to O-2 of 3.76:1 (mole ratio). n-Heptane
   was studied at 9 bar, phi = 1, and a dilution level of buffer gas to O-2
   of 5.63:1 (mole ratio). For experiments where two-stage ignition was
   observed, the buffer gas composition had no impact on the first-stage
   ignition time but, as expected, it caused differences in the total heat
   release, pressure and temperature rise after the first-stage ignition.
   As a consequence, significant differences were observed for the total
   ignition delay time as a function of the buffer gas composition, with up
   to 40\% and 42.5\% faster total ignition time for iso-octane and
   n-heptane, respectively, by using Ar instead of N-2. The chemical
   effects of the buffer gas composition were studied experimentally by
   comparing the results of the N-2 and Ar/CO2 (65.1\%/34.9\%) mixtures,
   recognizing that while the Ar/CO2 mixture has the same heat capacity as
   N-2, its predicted combined third-body collision efficiency is about
   76\% higher than N-2. The experimental results showed negligible
   chemical effects on the first-stage and total ignition delay times.
   Numerical simulations were carried out over a wider range of
   temperatures for pure N-2, Ar, and CO2 as buffer gases. Results showed
   that thermal effects are very pronounced and dominated at the negative
   temperature coefficient and two-stage ignition conditions, which is
   consistent with the experimental results and previous studies in the
   literature. However, the simulation results also showed at temperatures
   higher than 850 K, the chemical effects of CO2 became more important
   than the thermal effects. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published

Abstract = {{An a priori analysis of the flamelet model for diffusion flames is
   conducted to systematically assess model assumptions that are associated
   with the asymptotic expansion, the omission of higher-order expansion
   terms, the consideration of preferential diffusion effects, and the
   one-dimensional flamelet representation. For this, a recent direct
   numerical simulation database of a reacting hydrogen/air
   jet-in-cross-flow (JICF) by Grout et al. {[}15,16] is used. The full
   flamelet equation for temperature, exact to the order of the Eulerian
   transport equation and general to different definitions of the mixture
   fraction, is derived. Analysis of mixture fraction conditioned profiles
   of temperature and scalar dissipation rate along the jet trajectory
   identified different ignition and flame stabilization scenarios on the
   windward and leeward sides of the reacting JICF. A balance analysis of
   the temperature flamelet equation is conducted to quantify contributions
   in flame-aligned and flame-orthogonal directions. Consistent with the
   flamelet assumption, it is shown that terms arising from scalar
   diffusion, heat-release, and species-diffusion-induced enthalpy flux are
   the dominant contributions, while the flame-aligned preferential
   diffusion promotes entrainment of heat into the flamelet structure. For
   the current JICF-configuration, it is found that contributions along the
   flame-orthogonal direction are on average negligible. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Experiments under two intake air swirl levels (swirl ratios of 0.55 and
   5.68) were conducted in order to investigate the early flame development
   of combustion in a single-cylinder spark-ignition direct-injection
   engine. The engine was equipped with a quartz insert in the piston,
   which provided an optical access to its cylinder through the piston. The
   crank angle resolved combustion images through the piston window and
   in-cylinder pressure measurements of 250 cycles were simultaneously
   recorded for both swirl levels at a specified engine speed and low load
   condition. The early development, size, and spatial characteristics
   extracted from the flame images were analyzed as a function of crank
   angle degrees after the ignition. The experimental results revealed that
   the early flame development was strongly influenced by the highly
   directed swirl motion of intake-air into the combustion cylinder. The
   location of the start of the flame kernel relative to the spark plug
   position also changed intermittently at different swirl levels. While
   the structure of the early flame was found to be similar for both swirl
   levels, the starting location of the flame showed a vast difference in
   how the flame progressed. In general, the flame kernel was formed two
   crank-angle degrees after spark timing for the high swirl level, which
   was four crank-angle degrees earlier than that of the low swirl case.
   For the low swirl flow, the early combustion showed more cycle-to-cycle
   variation in terms of both the flame size and centroid location. It was
   quantitatively shown that increasing the swirl ratio from 0.55 to 5.68
   could reduce the cycle-to-cycle variation of the early flame structure,
   resulting in about three to four crank-angle degrees advance of the peak
   pressure location and a 1\% improvement for the coefficient of variation
   (COV) of the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP).}},

Abstract = {{Online process monitoring in ultrasonic welding of automotive
   lithium-ion batteries is essential for robust and reliable battery pack
   assembly. Effective quality monitoring algorithms have been developed to
   identify out of control parts by applying purely statistical
   classification methods. However, such methods do not provide the deep
   physical understanding of the manufacturing process that is necessary to
   provide diagnostic capability when the process is out of control. The
   purpose of this study is to determine the physical correlation between
   ultrasonic welding signal features and the ultrasonic welding process
   conditions and ultimately joint performance. A deep understanding in
   these relationships will enable a significant reduction in production
   launch time and cost, improve process design for ultrasonic welding, and
   reduce operational downtime through advanced diagnostic methods. In this
   study, the fundamental physics behind the ultrasonic welding process is
   investigated using two process signals, weld power and horn
   displacement. Several online features are identified by examining those
   signals and their variations under abnormal process conditions. The
   joint quality is predicted by correlating such online features to weld
   attributes such as bond density and postweld thickness that directly
   impact the weld performance. This study provides a guideline for feature
   selection and advanced diagnostics to achieve a reliable online quality
   monitoring system in ultrasonic metal welding.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, heat transfer of a steady, incompressible water based
   nanofluid flow over a stretching sheet in the presence of transverse
   magnetic field with thermal radiation and buoyancy effects are
   investigated. A similarity transformation is used to reduce the
   governing momentum and energy equations into non-linear ordinary
   differential equations. The resulting differential equations with the
   appropriate boundary conditions are solved by shooting iteration
   technique together with fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration scheme.
   Analytical solutions are presented in terms of hypergeometric function
   for the special case of horizontal stretching sheet. The effects of the
   physical parameters on the flow and heat transfer characteristics are
   presented through graphs and analysed for Cu-metal and Cu-oxide
   nanoparticles. The values of skin friction coefficient and the reduced
   Nusselt number are calculated and presented through tables. Furthermore,
   the limiting cases are obtained and are found to be in good agreement
   with the previously published results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Developing engineers must be aware that technological development and
   emerging global issues will require a keen sense of ethical
   responsibility. Therefore, they must be prepared to reason through and
   act appropriately on the ethical dilemmas they will experience as
   professionals. From a civil engineering professional perspective,
   graduates need to conform to the ASCE Body of Knowledge as they prepare
   for the Vision of 2025. This investigation evaluated different
   institutional approaches for ethics education with a goal of better
   preparing students to be ethical professionals. The project included
   visiting 19 diverse partner institutions and collecting data from nearly
   150 faculty and administrators and more than 4,000 engineering
   undergraduates including 567 civil engineering undergraduates who
   completed the survey. Findings suggest that co-curricular experiences
   have an important influence on ethical development, that quality of
   instruction is more important than quantity of curricular experiences,
   that students are less likely to be satisfied with ethics instruction
   when they have higher ethical reasoning skills, and that the
   institutional culture makes affects how students behave and how they
   articulate concepts of ethics. Overall, regression analysis indicates
   that civil engineering student responses were consistent with the
   overall engineering undergraduate population. Finally, the research
   suggests the curricular foundation is in place, but that institutions
   need to improve their curricular and co-curricular offerings to
   facilitate ethical development of students and fulfill ASCE Body of
   Knowledge outcomes. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Synthesizing interpreted domain-specific models to manage smart

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{172-193}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The increase in prominence of model-driven software development (MDSD)
   has placed emphasis on the use of domain-specific modeling languages
   (DSMLs) during the development process. DSMLs allow for domain concepts
   to be conceptualized and represented at a high level of abstraction.
   Currently, most DSML models are converted into high-level languages
   (HLLs) through a series of model-to-model and/or model-to-text
   transformations before they are executed. An alternative approach for
   model execution is the interpretation of models directly without
   converting them into an HLL. These models are created using interpreted
   DSMIs (i-DSMLs) and realized using a semantic-rich execution engine or
   domain-specific virtual machine (DSVM).
   In this article we present an approach for model synthesis, the first
   stage of model interpretation, that separates the domain-specific
   knowledge (DSK) from the model of execution (MoE). Previous work on
   model synthesis tightly couples the DSK and MoE reducing the ability for
   implementations of the DSVM to be easily reused in other domains. To
   illustrate how our approach to model synthesis works for i-DSMLs, we
   have created MGridML, an i-DSML for energy management in smart
   microgrids, and an MGridVM prototype, the DSVM for MGridML. We evaluated
   our approach by performing experiments on the model synthesis aspect of
   MGridVM and comparing the results to a DSVM from the user-centric
   communication domain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal and spatial control of growth factor gradients is critical for
   tissue patterning and differentiation. Reinitiation of this
   developmental program is also required for regeneration of tissues
   during wound healing and tissue regeneration. Devising methods for
   reconstituting growth factor gradients remains a central challenge in
   regenerative medicine. In the current study we develop a novel gene
   therapy approach for temporal and spatial control of two important
   growth factors in bone regeneration, vascular endothelial growth factor,
   and bone morphogenetic protein 2, which involves application of high
   intensity focused ultrasound to cells engineered with a heat-activated-
   and ligand-inducible gene switch. Induction of transgene expression was
   tightly localized within cell-scaffold constructs to subvolumes of
   similar to 30 mm(3), and the amplitude and projected area of transgene
   expression was tuned by the intensity and duration of ultrasound
   exposure. Conditions for ultrasound-activated transgene expression
   resulted in minimal cytotoxicity and scaffold damage. Localized regions
   of growth factor expression also established gradients in signaling
   activity, suggesting that patterns of growth factor expression generated
   by this method will have utility in basic and applied studies on tissue
   development and regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBVs) are promising in the replacement
   of diseased vascular tissues. However, it remains a great challenge to
   obtain a sufficient number of functional smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in a
   clinical setting to construct patient-specific TEBVs. In addition, it is
   critical to develop a scaffold to accommodate these cells and retain
   their functional phenotype for the regeneration of TEBVs. In this study,
   human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were established from
   primary human aortic fibroblasts, and characterized with the
   pluripotency markers expression and cells' capabilities to differentiate
   into all three germ layer cells. A highly efficient method was then
   developed to induce these human iPSCs into proliferative SMCs. After
   multiple times of expansion, the expanded SMCs retained the potential to
   be induced into the functional contractile phenotype of mature SMCs,
   which was characterized by the contractile response to carbachol
   treatment, up-regulation of specific collagen genes under transforming
   growth factor beta 1 treatment, and up-regulation of specific matrix
   metalloproteinase genes under cytokine stimulation. We also developed an
   advanced macroporous and nanofibrous (NF) poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA)
   scaffold with suitable pore size and interpore connectivity to seed
   these human iPSC-derived SMCs and maintain their differentiated
   phenotype. Subcutaneous implantation of the SMC-scaffold construct in
   nude mice demonstrated vascular tissue formation, with robust
   collagenous matrix deposition inside the scaffold and the maintenance of
   differentiated SMC phenotype. Taken together, this study established an
   exciting approach towards the construction of patient-specific TEBVs. We
   established patient-specific human iPSCs, derived proliferative SMCs for
   expansion, turned on their mature contractile SMC phenotype, and
   developed an advanced scaffold for these cells to regenerate vascular
   tissue in vivo. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology of swift heavy ion tracks in the Gd2Zr2-xTixO7 pyrochlore
   system has been investigated as a function of the variation in chemical
   composition and electronic energy loss, dE/dx, over a range of energetic
   ions: Ni-58, Ru-101, (129)xe, Ta-181, Au-197, Pb-208 and U-238 of 11.1
   MeV/u specific energy. Bright-field transmission electron microscopy,
   synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy reveal an
   increasing degree of amorphization with increasing Ti-content and dE/dx.
   The size and morphology of individual ion tracks in Gd2Ti2O7 were
   characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
   revealing a core-shell structure with an outer defect-fluorite dominated
   shell at low dE/dx to predominantly amorphous tracks at high dE/dx.
   Inelastic thermal-spike calculations have been used together with
   atomic-scale characterization of ion tracks in Gd2Ti2O7 by high
   resolution transmission electron microscopy to deduce critical energy
   densities for the complex core shell morphologies induced by ions of
   different dE/dx. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Proton irradiation-induced creep of ultra-fine grain graphite}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{993-1010}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to systematically study the effects of
   applied tensile stress, dose rate, temperature, and accumulated dose on
   the in situ proton irradiation-induced creep behavior of graphite.
   Experiments were performed on ultra-fine grain POCO Graphite Inc.
   ZXF-5Q. The irradiation creep rate exhibited a linear dependence on
   applied tensile stress, dose rate, and temperature and no dependence on
   dose to a total accumulated value of 1.0 dpa. These dependencies showed
   reasonably good agreement with in-reactor creep data. Analysis of the
   crystal structure and crystallite size parameters following irradiation
   under load revealed that the most-probable source of structural change
   is formation of interstitial clusters between basal planes and
   uncollapsed vacancy lines, in agreement with changes observed for
   graphite irradiated in-reactor. The parametric dependencies and the
   change of the lattice parameters, and crystallite dimensions, were
   compared with dependencies from several potential mechanisms of
   irradiation-induced creep and revealed, via process of elimination, that
   Stress-Induced Preferential Absorption (SIPA) is the most likely
   mechanism to explain irradiation-induced creep in this material. (C)

Title = {{Shock wave-boundary layer interactions in rectangular inlets:
   three-dimensional separation topology and critical points}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{756}},
Pages = {{328-353}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The interaction between two separated flow regions was studied for the
   fundamental problem of a shock wave-boundary layer interaction (SBLI)
   within a rectangular inlet. One motivation is that the inlet of an
   engine on a supersonic aircraft may contain separation zones on the
   sidewalls and the bottom wall; if one region separates first it can
   alter the flow on the other wall and lead to engine unstart. In our work
   an oblique shock wave was generated by a wedge suspended from the upper
   wall of a Mach 2.75 wind tunnel. Stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   measurements were recorded in 25 planes that include all three possible
   orthogonal orientations. The lateral velocity and vorticity measurements
   help to explain the underlying flow structure and these quantities were
   not measured previously for this problem. It is concluded that the
   sidewall and bottom wall separation zones interact due to an underlying
   flow structure that is similar to the two types of 3-D separation
   patterns previously described by Tobak \& Peake (Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech.,
   vol. 14, 1982, pp. 61-85). Separation first occurs at an upstream
   location where the shock interacts with the sidewall. Lateral velocities
   direct flow toward the centreline to cause separation on the bottom
   wall. This causes significant curvature of the shock wave, so that even
   the region near the tunnel centreline cannot be explained by
   conventional 2-D concepts. A number of critical points (saddle points,
   nodes, focus points) were identified. Results are consistent with the
   general ideas of Burton \& Babinsky (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 707, 2012, pp.
   287-306) and help to provide details of how the sidewalls redistribute
   the adverse pressure gradient in space.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, longitudinal oscillation applied to the cathode electrode
   during the electrochemical discharge micro drilling of glass and the
   effects of electrolyte flushing alteration in both discharge and
   hydrodynamic regimes of the process have been investigated. In this
   regard, numerous sets of experiments have been conducted using different
   vibration frequencies and amplitudes. In addition, two geometrically
   different tools including cylindrical rod and micro drill were used as
   machining electrode (cathode). In the case of cylindrical rod, two types
   of longitudinal waveforms including square and sinusoidal ones were
   applied to the tool. The experiments were resulted in a noticeable
   improvement in material removal rate (MRR) using square waveform and a
   slight improvement in the case of sinusoidal waveform. Moreover, the
   obtained MRR by means of vibrating micro drill has been compared with
   those achieved by non-vibrating one in several oscillation frequencies
   and amplitudes. The results showed that the vibration of the micro drill
   cannot further improve the electrolyte flushing and MRR in comparison
   with non-vibrating one because of the inherent electrolyte flushing in
   micro drill through its flutes which is constant in vibrating and
   non-vibrating cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Gamma/neutron time-correlation for special nuclear material detection -
   Active stimulation of highly enriched uranium}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{358-366}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The time-correlated pulse-height technique can distinguish multiplying
   (special nuclear material) from non-multiplying sources. The technique
   relies upon the measurement of correlated photon-neutron pairs using
   organic liquid scintillation detectors. For such interactions, the
   distribution of measured neutron recoil energy versus the time-of-flight
   difference between correlated photons and neutrons are imprinted with
   the fission chain dynamics of the source. The theoretical
   time-of-arrival assuming the photons and neutrons are created in the
   same fission is calculated. Correlated pairs with longer time-of-arrival
   indicate delays caused by self-induced fission chains in a multiplying
   source. For the specific circumstances of simulated measurements of 25.4
   kg of highly enriched uranium at 50 cm source to detector distance,
   correlated pairs from fission chains can arrive upwards of 40 ns later
   than correlated pairs with the same neutron energies from
   non-multiplying sources like Cf-252 at the same source detector
   distance. The use of detectors with ns scale time resolution and the use
   of pulse digitization allows for the distinction of these events.
   This method has been used successfully in the past to measure a variety
   of plutonium-bearing samples. The particle transport code MCNPX-PoliMi
   has been used to simulate and validate these measurements as well. Due
   to the much lower signature emission rate of U-235, this technique has
   not yet been used to measure the presence of highly enriched uranium. In
   this work we therefore explore the use of the time-correlated
   pulse-height technique with the introduction of an interrogating neutron
   source to stimulate fission. The applicability of Cf-252, AmLi and a DD
   generator neutron sources is explored in a series of simulations. All
   three sources are viable options with their own pros and cons with the
   choice of appropriate source depending upon the intended application.
   The TCPH technique is envisioned as a viable measurement solution of
   special nuclear material in situations in which the presence of
   shielding material disqualifies the use of passive gamma spectroscopy or
   gamma spectroscopy reveals classified information on the special nuclear
   material's isotopic composition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In calm sea environments and for compact architectures, the power
   generation performance of wave energy converters may be drastically
   inhibited due to undesired dissipative effects in the conversion
   mechanisms. This research develops an alternative power take-off
   methodology to surmount these challenges and to enable practical wave
   energy conversion for mobile converter architectures that could power
   monitoring instrumentation or telecommunications. Building upon related
   research findings and engineering insights, the basis for energy
   conversion is the harnessing of impulsive kinetics induced as a
   multistable structure is extended and compressed. A prototype system is
   built and analyzed to evaluate the potential for this conversion
   framework. Composed of modular ``cells{''}, the chain-like platform
   exhibits an increased number of stable configurations with each
   additional unit cell. Extension and compression of one end of the
   multistable chain (representative of wave heaving) while the opposing
   end remains mostly fixed, excites high frequency inter-cell dynamics due
   to impulsive transitions amongst configurations that are converted to
   electric current through electromagnetic induction. An experimentally
   validated model is utilized to gain insight towards successful
   realization of the power conversion concept and design guidelines are
   derived to maximize performance and ensure viability. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{HSS-to-HSS seismic moment connection performance and design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Hollow structural sections (HSS) provide an alternative to typical wide
   flange sections in low-rise seismic moment resisting frames. Their
   beneficial strength-to-weight ratio as well as bending, compression, and
   torsional resistance increases the versatility of moment frames and
   potentially improves performance under earthquake loads. With an
   understanding of current design requirements for seismic moment
   connections and static HSS-to-HSS connections, 39 fully welded
   unreinforced HSS-to-HSS connections are explored through finite element
   analyses. However, performance is limited due to column face
   plastification and inability to develop the plastic moment capacity of
   the beam. To rectify this problem, 24 through plate and 24 external
   diaphragm plate HSS-to-HSS moment connections are analyzed. Several
   important geometric parameters, such as the beam width-column width
   ratio, beam thickness-column thickness ratio, plate length, and plate
   thickness are considered to understand their effect on the connection
   moment capacity and sources of inelastic rotation. The through plate and
   external diaphragm reinforcement greatly improve the connection behavior
   moving yielding away from the column face and into the beam member. The
   results from the reinforced connections are used in combination with
   current seismic design provisions to develop a design procedure that
   optimizes the performance of these connections. The reinforced
   connections can be detailed to develop plastic hinging in the HSS beam
   member while minimizing the likelihood of a non-ductile weld failure.

Abstract = {{The total harmonic distortion (THD) of a waveform is a standard way to
   quantify its deviation from a sinusoid. In three-phase systems, we are
   interested in minimizing 3THD: the component of THD produced by odd
   nontriplen harmonics. However, its definition involves an infinite sum,
   making it difficult to evaluate and analyze. This paper solves the
   problem of finding equivalent closed-form expressions for the 3THD of a
   staircase waveform. In particular, two expressions are rigorously
   derived, which reveal 3THD to be a piecewise differentiable function.
   One expression is shorter but describes the pieces implicitly. The other
   is longer but describes the pieces explicitly. We minimize 3THD using
   the closed-form expression and provide a comparison with previous
   techniques. Finally, we provide experimental results that show close
   agreement with the theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{A dual-particle imaging (DPI) system capable of simultaneously detecting
   and imaging fast neutrons and photons has been designed and built
   Imaging fast neutrons and photons simultaneously is particularly
   desirable for nuclear nonproliferation and/or safeguards applications
   because typical sources of interest (special nuclear material) emit both
   particle types. The DPI system consists of three detection planes: the
   first two planes consist of organic liquid scintillators and the third
   plane consists of Nal(TI) inorganic scintillators. Pulse shape
   discrimination technique(s) may be used for the liquid scintillators to
   differentiate neutron and photon pulses whereas the Nal(TI)
   scintillators are highly insensitive to neutrons. A prototype DPI system
   was set up using a digital data acquisition system as a proof of
   concept. Initial measurements showed potential for use of the DPI system
   with special nuclear material. The DPI system has efficiencies of the
   order of 10-4 correlated counts per incident particles for both neutron
   and photon correlated counts, with simple-backprojection images
   displaying peaks within a few degrees of the source location. This
   uncertainty is expected to decrease with more extensive data
   interpretation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable, injectable depot formulations for long-term controlled
   drug release have improved therapy for a number of drug molecules and
   led to over a dozen highly successful pharmaceutical products. Until
   now, success has been limited to several small molecules and peptides,
   although remarkable improvements have been accomplished in some of these
   cases. For example, twice-a-year depot injections with leuprolide are
   available compared to the once-a-day injection of the solution dosage
   form. Injectable depots are typically prepared by encapsulation of the
   drug in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), a polymer that is used in
   children every day as a resorbable suture material, and therefore,
   highly biocompatible. PLGAs remain today as one of the few ``real
   world{''} biodegradable synthetic biomaterials used in US FDA-approved
   parenteral long-acting-release (LAR) products. Despite their success,
   there remain critical barriers to the more widespread use of PLGA
   LARproducts, particularly for delivery of more peptides and other large
   molecular drugs, namely proteins. In this review, we describe key
   concepts in the development of injectable PLGA controlled-release depots
   for peptides and proteins, and then use this information to identify key
   issues impeding greater widespread use of PLGA depots for this class of
   drugs. Finally, we examine important approaches, particularly those
   developed in our research laboratory, toward overcoming these barriers
   to advance commercial LAR development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the absorption of electromagnetic power
   that results from the interaction of electromagnetic waves and
   cylindrical bumps or trenches on flat conducting surfaces.
   Configurations are characterized by means of adequately selected
   dimensionless variables and parameters so that applicability to
   mathematically equivalent (but physically diverse) systems can be
   achieved easily. Electromagnetic fields and absorption increments caused
   by such surface defects are evaluated by means of a high-order integral
   equation method which resolves fine details of the field near the
   surface, and which was validated by fully analytical approaches in a
   range of computationally challenging cases. The computational method is
   also applied to problems concerning bumps and trenches on imperfect
   conducting planes for which analytical solutions are not available.
   Typically, we find that absorption is enhanced by the presence of the
   defects considered, although, interestingly, absorption can also be
   significantly reduced in some cases-such as, e. g., in the case of a
   trench on a conducting plane where the incident electric field is
   perpendicular to the plane. Additionally, it is observed that, for some
   small-skin-depths large-wavelengths, the absorption increment is
   proportional to the increase in surface area. Significant physical
   insight is obtained on the heating that results from various types of
   electromagnetic incident fields. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and proteins
   is essential for the design of bionanotechnology and biomedicine and for
   delineating the biological implications of nanomaterials for safe
   nanotechnology. In the present study we have examined protein
   denaturation in the presence of NPs, using the high-throughput technique
   of differential scanning fluorometry. Specifically, the melting
   temperature of human immunoglobulin (IgG) rose from 59.5 to 68.5 degrees
   C while that of lysozyme dropped from 74.0 to 68.8 degrees C for
   increasing NP:protein molar ratios. This contrast in protein stability
   was further examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and Thioflavin T
   measurements, where a marked increase in beta-sheets as well as amyloid
   fibrillation occurred in lysozyme while small changes were seen in the
   secondary structure of IgG. Our immunoassays further revealed a greatly
   elevated cytokine production in the cells treated with fullerol-lysozyme
   and a mostly unchanged TNF-alpha secretion in THP-1 cells exposed to
   fullerol-IgG, suggesting a connection between changes in protein
   secondary structure induced by fullerol binding and their triggered
   immune responses. These contrasting effects imply that, due to their
   finite solubility and size NPs display the duality of both a particle
   and a chemical and, therefore, do not conform to the conventional role
   of a ligand in protein stabilization.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic material in living cells is organized into complex
   structures in which DNA is subjected to substantial contortions. Here we
   investigate the difference in structure, dynamics, and flexibility
   between two topological states of a short (107 base pair) DNA sequence
   in a linear form and a covalently closed, tightly curved circular DNA
   form. By employing a combination of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations and elastic rod modeling of DNA, which allows capturing
   microscopic details while monitoring the global dynamics, we demonstrate
   that in the highly curved regime the microscopic flexibility of the DNA
   drastically increases due to the local mobility of the duplex. By
   analyzing vibrational entropy and Lipari-Szabo NMR order parameters from
   the simulation data, we propose a novel model for the thermodynamic
   stability of high-curvature DNA states based on vibrational untightening
   of the duplex. This novel view of DNA bending provides a fundamental
   explanation that bridges the gap between classical models of DNA and
   experimental studies on DNA cyclization, which so far have been in
   substantial disagreement.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the pathologic development of ectopic
   bone in soft tissues because of a local or systemic inflammatory insult,
   such as burn injury or trauma. In HO, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are
   inappropriately activated to undergo osteogenic differentiation. Through
   the correlation of in vitro assays and in vivo studies (dorsal scald
   burn with Achilles tenotomy), we have shown that burn injury enhances
   the osteogenic potential of MSCs and causes ectopic endochondral
   heterotopic bone formation and functional contractures through bone
   morphogenetic protein-mediated canonical SMAD signaling. We further
   demonstrated a prevention strategy for HO through adenosine triphosphate
   (ATP) hydrolysis at the burn site using apyrase. Burn site apyrase
   treatment decreased ATP, increased adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, and
   decreased phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 in MSCs in vitro. This ATP
   hydrolysis also decreased HO formation and mitigated functional
   impairment in vivo. Similarly, selective inhibition of SMAD1/5/8
   phosphorylation with LDN-193189 decreased HO formation and increased
   range of motion at the injury site in our burn model in vivo. Our
   results suggest that burn injury-exacerbated HO formation can be treated
   through therapeutics that target burn site ATP hydrolysis and modulation
   of SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation.}},

Abstract = {{Natural materials such as bone and tooth achieve precisely tuned
   mechanical and interfacial properties by varying the concentration and
   orientation of their nanoscale constituents. However, the realization of
   such control in engineered foams is limited by manufacturing-driven
   tradeoffs among the size, order, and dispersion uniformity of the
   building blocks. It is demonstrated how to manufacture nanocomposite
   foams with precisely controllable mechanical properties via aligned
   carbon nanotube (CNT) growth followed by atomic layer deposition (ALD).
   By starting with a low density CNT forest and varying the ALD coating
   thickness, we realize predictable approximate to 1000-fold control of
   Young's modulus (14 MPa to 20 GPa, where E approximate to (2.8)),
   ultimate compressive strength (0.8 MPa to 0.16 GPa), and energy
   absorption (0.4 to 400 J cm(-3)). Owing to the continuous, long CNTs
   within the ceramic nanocomposite, the compressive strength and toughness
   of the new material are 10-fold greater than commercially available
   aluminum foam over the same density range. Moreover, the compressive
   stiffness and strength equal that of compact bone at 10\% lower density.
   Along with emerging technologies for scalable patterning and
   roll-to-roll manufacturing and lamination of CNT films, coated CNT foams
   may be especially suited to multifunctional applications such as
   catalysis, filtration, and thermal protection.}},

Abstract = {{To obtain a molecular level view of the interface of a latex particle

   fields were performed for a slab of methyl methacrylate (MMA)/n-butyl
   acrylate (BA) random copolymer in water. The carbonyl groups at the
   polymer/water interface were found to orient significantly toward the
   water phase. We calculated the copolymer/water and the copolymer/vacuum
   interfacial tensions, and predict a contact angle for water on copolymer
   of 77 degrees, consistent with experimental values. We also calculated
   bulk densities of MMA/BA copolymer, and PMMA and PBA homopolymers, which
   compare well with experiment, and the structure factor for PMMA, which
   agrees with neutron scattering results. The simulated T-g of PMMA is not
   far from its experimental value, despite the much shorter chains and
   faster cooling rates of simulations versus experiments, because these
   two effects tend to cancel each other. When we correct for these
   effects, the predicted T-g is within 5 K of the experimental value.}},

Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive model for In0.18Ga0.82N/GaN self-assembled
   quantum dot (QD) active material. The strain distribution in the QD
   structure is studied using linear elastic theory with the application of
   the shrink-fit boundary condition at the material interface. Subsequent
   calculations also predict the strain-induced quantum-confined Stark
   effect (QCSE). Under carrier injection, the overall effect of band
   bending and charge screening is studied by solving the Schrodinger and
   Poisson equations self-consistently. The optical gain spectrum of the
   InGaN/GaN QD active material is calculated based on the electronic
   states solved from the Schrodinger-Poisson equation, and both the
   calculated material gain peak and emission wavelength agree well with
   the measured experimental data. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The energies and stresses associated with the decohesion of beta-SiC in
   the presence of mobile Pd and Ag impurities are studied from first
   principles. Density functional theory calculations are parameterized
   with a generalized cohesive zone model and are analyzed within a
   thermodynamic framework that accounts for realistic boundary conditions
   in the presence of mobile impurities. We find that Pd impurities will
   embrittle SiC when Pd is in equilibrium with metallic Pd precipitates.
   Our thermodynamic analysis predicts that Pd embrittles SiC by
   substantially reducing the maximum stress of decohesion as a result of a
   phase transition between decohering planes involving an influx of Pd
   atoms. The methods presented in this work can be applied to study the
   thermodynamics of decohesion of SiC in other aggressive environments
   containing oxygen and water, for example, and yield environment
   dependent cohesive zone models for use in continuum approaches to study
   crack propagation and fracture. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Organic scintillation detectors have shown promise as neutron detectors
   for characterizing special nuclear materials in various arms-control and
   homeland security applications. Recent advances have yielded a new
   plastic scintillator - EJ299-33 - with pulse-shape-discrimination (PSD)
   capability. Plastic scintillators would have a much expanded range of
   deployment relative to liquids and crystals. Here, we present a full
   characterization of pulse height response to fission-energy neutrons for
   an EJ299-33 detector with 7.62-by-7.62-cm cylindrical active volume, and
   compare with an EJ309 liquid scintillator in the same assembly.
   Scintillation light output relations, energy resolutions, and response
   matrices are presented for both detectors. A Continuous spectrum neutron
   source, obtained via the bombardment of Al-27 with 7.44-MeV deuterons at
   the Edwards Accelerator Facility at Ohio University, was used for the
   measurement. A new procedure for evaluating and comparing PSD
   performance is presented which accounts for the effect of the light
   output relation on the ability to detect low energy neutrons. The
   EJ299-33 is shown to have considerable deficit in matrix condition, and
   in PSD figure of merit when compared to EJ309, especially when neutron
   energy is taken into account. Nevertheless the EJ299 is likely to bring
   a modest PSD capability into a array of held applications that are not
   accessible to liquids or crystals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Validation of a bio-energetic model for juvenile salmonids using growth

Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},

Volume = {{433}},
Pages = {{201-207}},

Abstract = {{The long-term goal of this project has been to develop a reliable and
   practical model that can be used to predict food consumption, growth,
   and waste by-product generation associated with hatchery reared juvenile
   salmonids. This process began with the earlier development and
   validation of a bioenergetic model using growth data from two
   independent laboratory-scale feeding studies. The efficacy of this model
   is extended here using data from a production-scale growth and feeding
   study. During the first phase of the current study (135 days),
   commercial feed was provided to four separate groups of coho salmon
   (Oncorhynchus kisutch). One group received satiation rations, the next
   group was fed excess rations, another group was fed at about 75\%
   satiation, and the final group was fed a maintenance ration of about
   50\% satiation. During the next phase of the study (116 days), the coho
   that were grown on the excess rations during the first phase were
   provided a maintenance ration, and the original maintenance ration coho
   were fed to apparent satiation. The growth and proximate composition of
   the coho were measured approximately every two weeks during the entire
   study. Bioenergetic model calculations closely matched the measured
   growth data during both phases of the study following calibration for
   the maximum consumption and apparent respiration rate coefficients. The
   model performed equally well when the coho energy density was expressed
   either as a direct function of time or approximated with correlations
   with coho body weight. The strong performance of the model was first
   apparent when compared with independent laboratory-scale data. The
   proficiency of the model is demonstrated again here using
   production-scale growth data. These results support the contention that
   the bioenergetic model can be reliably used as a hatchery management
   tool to determine appropriate feeding levels, predict the growth of
   juvenile salmonids, and ultimately quantify the rate of waste by-product
   generation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{ROTAS: a rotamer-dependent, atomic statistical potential for assessment
   and prediction of protein structures}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Multibody potentials accounting for cooperative effects of
   molecular interactions have shown better accuracy than typical pairwise
   potentials. The main challenge in the development of such potentials is
   to find relevant structural features that characterize the tightly
   folded proteins. Also, the side-chains of residues adopt several
   specific, staggered conformations, known as rotamers within protein
   structures. Different molecular conformations result in different dipole
   moments and induce charge reorientations. However, until now modeling of
   the rotameric state of residues had not been incorporated into the
   development of multibody potentials for modeling non-bonded interactions
   in protein structures.
   Results: In this study, we develop a new multibody statistical potential
   which can account for the influence of rotameric states on the
   specificity of atomic interactions. In this potential, named
   ``rotamer-dependent atomic statistical potential{''} (ROTAS), the
   interaction between two atoms is specified by not only the distance and
   relative orientation but also by two state parameters concerning the
   rotameric state of the residues to which the interacting atoms belong.
   It was clearly found that the rotameric state is correlated to the
   specificity of atomic interactions. Such rotamer-dependencies are not
   limited to specific type or certain range of interactions. The
   performance of ROTAS was tested using 13 sets of decoys and was compared
   to those of existing atomic-level statistical potentials which
   incorporate orientation-dependent energy terms. The results show that
   ROTAS performs better than other competing potentials not only in native
   structure recognition, but also in best model selection and correlation
   coefficients between energy and model quality.
   Conclusions: A new multibody statistical potential, ROTAS accounting for
   the influence of rotameric states on the specificity of atomic
   interactions was developed and tested on decoy sets. The results show
   that ROTAS has improved ability to recognize native structure from decoy
   models compared to other potentials. The effectiveness of ROTAS may
   provide insightful information for the development of many applications
   which require accurate side-chain modeling such as protein design,
   mutation analysis, and docking simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells are fabricated using active
   material blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) donor, indene-C-60
   bisadduct (ICBA) acceptor, and an all-conjugated random copolymer (RCP)
   additive. By optimizing RCP loading, power conversion efficiencies
   (PCEs) up to 20\% higher than those of a binary P3HT: ICBA mixture are
   achieved. The improved device characteristics are rationalized in terms
   of the differences between the photoactive thin film morphologies.
   Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy reveals that
   incorporation of the RCP improves the degree of structural order of the
   BHJ fibrillar network and increases the extent of microphase separation
   between P3HT and ICBA. Additionally, a combination of atomic force
   microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates
   segregation of the RCP at the free interface, leading to a shift in the
   surface potentials measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy. These
   changes, both in the bulk morphology and in the interfacial
   composition/energetics, are correlated to improved carrier collection
   efficiency due to a reduction of non-geminate recombination, which is
   measured by charge extraction of photogenerated carriers by linearly
   increasing voltage.}},

Abstract = {{The nanoscale plasma protein interaction with intravenously injected
   particulate carrier systems is known to modulate their organ
   distribution and clearance from the bloodstream. However, the role of
   this plasma protein interaction in prescribing the adhesion of carriers
   to the vascular wall remains relatively unknown. Here, we show that the
   adhesion of vascular-targeted poly(lactide-co-glycolic-acid) (PLGA)
   spheres to endothelial cells is significantly inhibited in human blood
   flow, with up to 90\% reduction in adhesion observed relative to
   adhesion in simple buffer flow, depending on the particle size and the
   magnitude and pattern of blood flow. This reduced PLGA adhesion in blood
   flow is linked to the adsorption of certain high molecular weight plasma
   proteins on PLGA and is donor specific, where large reductions in
   particle adhesion in blood flow (> 80\% relative to buffer) is seen with
   similar to 60\% of unique donor bloods while others exhibit moderate to
   no reductions. The depletion of high molecular weight immunoglobulins
   from plasma is shown to successfully restore PLGA vascular wall
   adhesion. The observed plasma protein effect on PLGA is likely due to
   material characteristics since the effect is not replicated with
   polystyrene or silica spheres. These particles effectively adhere to the
   endothelium at a higher level in blood over buffer flow. Overall,
   understanding how distinct plasma proteins modulate the vascular wall
   interaction of vascular-targeted carriers of different material
   characteristics would allow for the design of highly functional delivery
   vehicles for the treatment of many serious human diseases.}},

Title = {{Interfacing whispering-gallery microresonators and free space light with
   cavity enhanced Rayleigh scattering}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Whispering gallery mode resonators (WGMRs) take advantage of strong
   light confinement and long photon lifetime for applications in sensing,
   optomechanics, microlasers and quantum optics. However, their rotational
   symmetry and low radiation loss impede energy exchange between WGMs and
   the surrounding. As a result, free-space coupling of light into and from
   WGMRs is very challenging. In previous schemes, resonators are
   intentionally deformed to break circular symmetry to enable free-space
   coupling of carefully aligned focused light, which comes with bulky size
   and alignment issues that hinder the realization of compact WGMR
   applications. Here, we report a new class of nanocouplers based on
   cavity enhanced Rayleigh scattering from nano-scatterer(s) on resonator
   surface, and demonstrate whispering gallery microlaser by free-space
   optical pumping of an Ytterbium doped silica microtoroid via the
   scatterers. This new scheme will not only expand the range of
   applications enabled by WGMRs, but also provide a possible route to
   integrate them into solar powered green photonics.}},

Title = {{Retention failure analysis of metal-oxide based resistive memory}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Resistive switching devices (RRAMs) have been proposed a promising
   candidate for future memory and neuromorphic applications. Central to
   the successful application of these emerging devices is the
   understanding of the resistance switching and failure mechanism, and
   identification of key physical parameters that will enable continued
   device optimization. In this study, we report detailed retention
   analysis of a TaOx based RRAM at high temperatures and the development
   of a microscopic oxygen diffusion model that fully explains the
   experimental results and can be used to guide future device
   developments. The device conductance in low resistance state (LRS) was
   constantly monitored at several elevated temperatures (above 300 degrees
   C), and an initial gradual conductivity drift followed by a sudden
   conductance drop were observed during retention failure. These
   observations were explained by a microscopic model based on oxygen
   vacancy diffusion, which quantitatively explains both the initial
   gradual conductance drift and the sudden conductance drop. Additionally,
   a non-monotonic conductance change, with an initial conductance increase
   followed by the gradual conductance decay over time, was observed
   experimentally and explained within the same model framework.
   Specifically, our analysis shows that important microscopic physical
   parameters such as the activation energy for oxygen vacancy migration
   can be directly calculated from the failure time versus temperature
   relationship. Results from the analytical model were further supported
   by detailed numerical multi-physics simulation, which confirms the
   filamentary nature of the conduction path in LRS and the importance of
   oxygen vacancy diffusion in device reliability. Finally, these
   high-temperature stability measurements also reveal the existence of
   multiple filaments in the same device. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Natural killer (NK) cells safeguard against early tumor formation by
   destroying transformed target cells in a process referred to as NK
   immune surveillance. However, the immune escape mechanisms used by
   malignant brain tumors to subvert this innate type of immune
   surveillance remain unclear. Here we show that malignant glioma cells
   suppress NK immune surveillance by overexpressing the
   beta-galactoside-binding lectin galectin-1. Conversely,
   galectin-1-deficient glioma cells could be eradicated by host NK cells
   before the initiation of an antitumor T-cell response. In vitro
   experiments demonstrated that galectin-1-deficient GL26-Cit glioma cells
   are similar to 3-fold more sensitive to NK-mediated tumor lysis than
   galectin-1-expressing cells. Our findings suggest that galectin-1
   suppression in human glioma could improve patient survival by restoring
   NK immune surveillance that can eradicate glioma cells. (C) 2014 AACR.}},

Title = {{Subquadratic-scaling subspace projection method for large-scale
   Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations using spectral
   finite-element discretization}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{We present a subspace projection technique to conduct large-scale
   Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations using higher-order
   spectral finite-element discretization. The proposed method treats both
   metallic and insulating materials in a single framework and is
   applicable to both pseudopotential as well as all-electron calculations.
   The key ideas involved in the development of this method include: (i)
   employing a higher-order spectral finite-element basis that is amenable
   to mesh adaption; (ii) using a Chebyshev filter to construct a subspace,
   which is an approximation to the occupied eigenspace in a given
   self-consistent field iteration; (iii) using a localization procedure to
   construct a nonorthogonal localized basis spanning the Chebyshev
   filtered subspace; and (iv) using a Fermi-operator expansion in terms of
   the subspace-projected Hamiltonian represented in the nonorthogonal
   localized basis to compute relevant quantities like the density matrix,
   electron density, and band energy. We demonstrate the accuracy and
   efficiency of the proposed approach on benchmark systems involving
   pseudopotential calculations on aluminum nanoclusters up to 3430 atoms
   and on alkane chains up to 7052 atoms, as well as all-electron
   calculations on silicon nanoclusters up to 3920 electrons. The benchmark
   studies revealed that accuracies commensurate with chemical accuracy can
   be obtained with the proposed method, and a subquadratic-scaling with
   system size was observed for the range of materials systems studied. In
   particular, for the alkane chains-representing an insulating
   material-close to linear scaling is observed, whereas, for aluminum
   nanoclusters-representing a metallic material-the scaling is observed to
   be O(N-1.46). For all-electron calculations on silicon nanoclusters, the
   scaling with the number of electrons is computed to be O(N-1.75). In all
   the benchmark systems, significant computational savings have been
   realized with the proposed approach, with approximately tenfold speedups
   observed for the largest systems with respect to reference calculations.}},

Title = {{A physics-based gap-flow model for potential flow solvers}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{578-587}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Gap/clearance flows (also known as tip gap flows) affect the
   hydrodynamic forces, flow structure, and cavitation in both
   turbomachines and hydrofoils. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers
   permit high-fidelity, viscous simulations of gap-flow, but the
   computational expense often prohibits their use for fully exploring
   design spaces. Conventional potential flow solvers, on the other hand,
   cannot capture the viscosity-dominated gap-flow dynamics. In the present
   study, a physics-based gap-flow model is presented to capture the
   critical effects of gap-flow using general potential flow solvers. This
   is accomplished by re-casting a lift-retention model as a corrected
   boundary condition. A simple lifting-line formulation is used to
   demonstrate the applicability of the gap-flow model. Results from the
   lifting-line analysis, modified by the gap-flow model, are compared with
   experimental measurements and high-fidelity CFD simulations over a range
   of gap sizes for two confined-wing arrangements with different
   geometries and flow conditions. The modified lifting-line analysis
   improves significantly upon the circulation, downwash, and drag
   predictions, compared to a standard lifting-line formulation without the
   gap-flow model. A viscosity-corrected expression for tip-vortex strength
   is proposed. Using the viscous correction, qualitatively-correct trends
   are predicted for vortex strength and tip vortex minimum pressure
   coefficients across a range of foil aspect-ratios, gap sizes, and angles
   of attack. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in energy harvesting systems are needed to power wireless
   sensors for structural health monitoring. Research on developing a
   harvesting system that converts the low frequency, non-periodic, and
   low-acceleration vibrations present on bridges is continued and
   significantly extended in this work. The mechanics of the harvester were
   optimized to increase its robustness and lifetime, power electronics
   were added, and the complete system was installed on the New Carquinez
   suspension bridge in California. The complete results and analysis are
   presented in this study. The power management circuit is added to
   rectify and boost the low AC output of the harvester and convert it into
   a usable DC voltage. The harvester design is further enhanced to
   significantly improve performance and robustness. During short-term
   on-bridge testing, the system was able to charge a 10 mu F capacitor to
   2V DC, and the average harvester output power ranges from 1.6 to 5.0 mu
   W, depending on the location on the bridge, a 10x improvement over
   previous results. A long-term test of the harvesting system has been
   conducted, during which the performance of the system was monitored
   remotely using a wireless sensor network. The system improvements
   described in this study enabled continuous operation in the harsh bridge
   environment for 13 months starting April 30, 2012 and constitute a major
   milestone in the development of miniaturized motion harvesters. Finally,
   the system was retrieved and analyzed to understand and verify the cause
   of observed long-term performance changes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study reports a novel and systematic strategy on the preparation
   and characterization of pH-responsive and anti-fouling composite
   membranes via one-pot in-situ cross-linked copolymerization. Typical
   commercial polyethersulfone (PES) is used as membrane matrix; poly
   (methyl methacrylate-co-acrylic acid) (P(MMA-AA)) and poly(methyl
   methylacrylate-co-4vinyl pyridine) (P(MMA-4VPy)) are applied as model
   pH-responsive copolymers. The casting solutions are directly synthesized
   by one-pot in-situ cross-linked copolymerization of MMA, AA/4VPy and
   cross-linker in PES solutions; then, composite membranes are obtained by
   a liquid-liquid phase inversion method. ATR-FTIR, water contact angle,
   membrane morphology, pH sensitivity and reversibility, protein
   anti-fouling property, and Cu2+ adsorption capacity for the composite
   membranes are systematically investigated. The cross-section SEM data
   indicated that the composite membranes owned typical finger-like
   structure; while the surface SEM images indicated that the in-situ
   copolymerized system exhibited excellent miscibility between PES and
   copolymers. The pH-responsive tests proved that the PES/P(MMA-AA) and
   PES/P(MMA-4VPy) membranes owned remarkable and reversible pH-responsive
   performance. Protein ultrafiltration experiments showed that the
   composite membranes exhibited excellent anti-fouling property.
   Furthermore, the prepared composite membranes exhibited good Cu2+
   adsorption capacity. The results demonstrated that the proposed in-situ
   cross-linked copolymerization provided a facile and practical approach
   to fabricate pH-responsive and antifouling membranes for various
   applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We use a two-dimensional phase-field model coupled to a nucleation
   mechanism to study the evolution of interdendritic liquid pools during
   late-stage solidification of Mg-Al alloys under spatially uniform
   temperature and constant cooling rates. We obtain the channel size
   distribution (CSD) of liquid pools at solid fractions close to those
   where eutectic phase is expected to form and investigate the influence
   of cooling rate on the morphology of the CSD at different solidification
   stages. Our results show that the CSD is unimodal, exhibiting a peak at
   small channel widths followed by a shoulder and longer decay tail at
   large channel widths. This feature is correlated to the presence of two
   distinct liquid regions, small channels between secondary branches of
   the primary phase and larger channels between adjacent grains. We
   construct a cooling-rate/solid-fraction morphology diagram that shows
   the relative importance of the shoulder in the CSD. We characterize the
   mean and standard deviation of the CSD and show that, within the range
   of data examined, the mean channel size vs. cooling rate curves scale
   with solid fraction. The numerical tools developed for this work can
   also be used to analyze experimental results. We include the analysis of
   two experimental micrographs previously published by Paliwal et al. (C)

Abstract = {{A combinatorial approach was used to investigate the effects of
   higher-order additions to NiAl on the oxidation, phase stability and
   interdiffusion behavior of the coatings. Overlay coatings with
   compositions (in at.\%) in the range Ni-38Al-5Cr-(0.1-0.5)Hf-(2-8)Pd and
   Ni-36Al-5Cr-(0.1-0.5)Hf-(2-8)Pt were deposited on Rene N5 single crystal
   substrates via ion plasma deposition (IPD). Cyclic oxidation experiments
   on ten different Pd + Hf- or Pt + Hf-modified NiAlCr coatings at 1100
   degrees C revealed similar weight gain and oxide scale thickness. While
   the thickness of alumina scales formed on Pd- and Pt-modified coatings
   were comparable, a higher density of oxide spalls were observed in the
   former. High-temperature transformations from beta -> gamma' -> gamma +
   gamma' occurred during extended exposure in both Pd- and Pt-modified
   coatings owing to Al depletion to substrate and surface oxide. On
   cooling, Al-depleted beta-NiAl transformed to two martensite phases, 3R
   and fine-twinned 7R. Rumpling or surface roughening occurred for some
   coating compositions. Microprobe measurements showed that the difference
   in penetration depths of Pd into the substrate was not as large as
   expected from the higher interdiffusion coefficient of Pd in beta-NiAl
   and gamma-Ni. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The inverse problem of parameterizing intermolecular potentials given
   macroscopic transport and thermodynamic data is addressed. Procedures
   are developed to create arbitrary-precision algorithms for transport
   collision integrals, using the Leonard-Jones (12-6) potential as an
   example. Interpolation formulas are produced that compute these
   collision integrals to four-digit accuracy over the reduced-temperature
   range 0.3 <= T{*} <= 400, allowing very fast computation. Lennard-Jones
   parameters for neon, argon, and krypton are determined by simultaneously
   fitting the observed temperature dependences of their viscosities and
   second virial coefficients-one of the first times that a thermodynamic
   and a dynamic property have been used simultaneously for Lennard-Jones
   parameterization. In addition to matching viscosities and second virial
   coefficients within the bounds of experimental error, the determined
   Lennard-Jones parameters are also found to predict the thermal
   conductivity and self-diffusion coefficient accurately, supporting the
   value of the Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential for noble-gas
   transport-property correlation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{CuIn1-xFexS2 (x = 0-0.15) was synthesized via high-temperature,
   solid-state synthesis. Rietveld refinements using the neutron and
   synchrotron powder diffraction data indicate that all Fe-substituted
   materials are phase pure with the exception of the CuIn0.85Fe0.15S2
   sample, which contains a minute secondary phase. These refinements also
   verify that iron resides on the indium site in the CuIn1-xFexS2
   materials. CuIn0.875Fe0.125S2 displayed the lowest total thermal
   conductivity of the series, 1.37 W m(-1) K-1 at 570 K, as well as the
   highest thermopower, -172 mu V K-1 at 560 K. The electrical conductivity
   increases over six times upon going from CuInS2 to CuIn0.875Fe0.125S2.
   These improved properties result in an increase in the thermoelectric
   figure of merit (ZT) of CuInS2 by over an order of magnitude for the x =
   0.125 sample. Magnetic measurements reveal the x = 0-0.10 samples to be
   paramagnetic, while the sample in which x = 0.125 displays ferromagnetic
   ordering below 95 K. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses a thermogravimetric method for the steam
   gasification of carbon deposited over ceria zirconia supported nickel
   (10\% Ni/CZO) catalysts. The carbon deposits, which were obtained from
   the decomposition of isooctane over 10\% Ni/CZO catalyst at 500, 650,
   and 725 degrees C, respectively, were used as the model species.
   Gasification temperature and characteristics of different carbon species
   have been investigated, and the resulting gaseous products were measured
   by FT-IR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. The carbon species formed
   at different decomposition temperatures indicated distinctly different
   ability for gasification. Combined with features of TPO profiles and SEM
   images, our experiments suggest that the coating carbon, which covers
   the surface of Ni/CZO catalyst, can be removed by gasification at low
   temperatures around 600 degrees C. However, the gasification degree of
   filamentous carbon species depends on its formation temperature. For
   filamentous carbon obtained from isooctane decomposition at 500 degrees
   C the gasification starts at 690 degrees C, while filamentous carbon
   species obtained from isooctane decomposition at temperatures >= 650
   degrees C undergo complete gasification at this temperature. (C) 2014

Title = {{A parallel finite-element framework for large-scale gradient-based
   design optimization of high-performance structures}},
Journal = {{FINITE ELEMENTS IN ANALYSIS AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{56-73}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Structural optimization using gradient-based methods is a powerful
   design technique that is well suited for the design of high-performance
   structures. However, the ever-increasing complexity of finite-element
   models and design formulations results in a bottleneck in the
   computation of the gradients required for the design optimization.
   Furthermore, in light of current high-performance computing trends, any
   methods intended to address this bottleneck must efficiently utilize
   parallel computing resources. Therefore, there is a need for solution
   and gradient evaluation methods that scale well with the number of
   design variables, constraints, and processors. We address this need by
   developing an integrated parallel finite-element analysis tool for
   gradient-based design optimization that is designed to use specialized
   parallel solution methods to solve large-scale high-fidelity structural
   optimization problems with thousands of design variables, millions of
   state variables, and hundreds of load cases. We describe the most
   relevant details of the parallel algorithms used within the tool. We
   present consistent constraint formulations and aggregation techniques
   for both material failure and buckling constraints. To demonstrate both
   the solution and functional accuracy, we compare our results to an exact
   solution of a pressure-loaded cylinder made with either isotropic or
   orthotropic material. To demonstrate the parallel solution and gradient
   evaluation performance, we perform a structural analysis and gradient
   evaluation for a large transport aircraft wing with over 5.44 million
   unknowns. The results show near-ideal scalability of the structural
   solution and gradient computation with the number of design variables,
   constraints, and processors, which makes this framework well suited for
   large-scale high-fidelity structural design optimization. (C) 2014

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Fast ionization waves (FIWs), often generated with high voltage pulses
   over nanosecond timescales, are able to produce large volumes of ions
   and excited states at moderate pressures. The mechanisms of FIW
   propagation were experimentally and computationally investigated to
   provide insights into the manner in which these large volumes are
   excited. The two-dimensional structure of electron and metastable
   densities produced by short-pulse FIWs sustained in helium were measured
   using laser-induced fluorescence and laser collision-induced
   fluorescence diagnostics for times of 100-120 ns after the pulse, as the
   pressure was varied from 1 to 20 Torr. A trend of center-peaked to
   volume-filling to wall-peaked electron density profiles was observed as
   the pressure was increased. Instantaneous FIW velocities, obtained from
   plasma-induced emission, ranged from 0.1 to 3 x 10(9) cm s(-1),
   depending on distance from the high voltage electrode and pressure.
   Predictions from two-dimensional modeling of the propagation of a single
   FIW correlated well with the experimental trends in electron density
   profiles and wave velocity. Results from the model show that the maximum
   ionization rate occurs in the wavefront, and the discharge continues to
   propagate forward after the removal of high voltage from the powered
   electrode due to the potential energy stored in the space charge. As the
   pressure is varied, the radial distribution of the ionization rate is
   shaped by changes in the electron mean free path, and subsequent
   localized electric field enhancement at the walls or on the centerline
   of the discharge. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The alpha-helix is a ubiquitous secondary structural element that is
   almost exclusively observed in proteins when stabilized by tertiary or
   quaternary interactions. However, beginning with the unexpected
   observations of alpha-helix formation in the isolated C-peptide in
   ribonuclease A, there is growing evidence that a significant percentage
   (0.2\%) of all proteins contain isolated stable single alpha-helical
   domains (SAH). These SAH domains provide unique structural features
   essential for normal protein function. A subset of SAH domains contain a
   characteristic ER/K motif, composed of a repeating sequence of similar
   to 4 consecutive glutamic acids followed by similar to 4 consecutive
   basic arginine or lysine (R/K) residues. The ER/K alpha-helix, also
   termed the ER/K linker, has been extensively characterized in the
   context of the myosin family of molecular motors and is emerging as a
   versatile structural element for protein and cellular engineering
   applications. Here, we review the structure and function of SAH domains,
   as well as the tools to identify them in natural proteins. We conclude
   with a discussion of recent studies that have successfully used the
   modular ER/K linker for engineering chimeric myosin proteins with
   altered mechanical properties, as well as synthetic polypeptides that
   can be used to monitor and systematically modulate protein interactions
   within cells.}},

Title = {{Investigation of capillary nanosecond discharges in air at moderate

Abstract = {{Nanosecond electrical discharges in the form of ionization waves are of
   interest for rapidly ionizing and exciting complex gas mixtures to
   initiate chemical reactions. Operating with a small discharge tube
   diameter can significantly increase the specific energy deposition and
   so enable optimization of the initiation process. Analysis of the
   uniformity of energy release in small diameter capillary tubes will aid
   in this optimization. In this paper, results for the experimentally
   derived characteristics of nanosecond capillary discharges in air at
   moderate pressure are presented and compared with results from a
   two-dimensional model. The quartz capillary tube, having inner and outer
   diameters of 1.5 and 3.4 mm, is about 80 mm long and filled with
   synthetic dry air at 27 mbar. The capillary tube with two electrodes at
   the ends is inserted into a break of the central wire of a long coaxial
   cable. A metal screen around the tube is connected to the cable ground
   shield. The discharge is driven by a 19 kV 35 ns voltage pulse applied
   to the powered electrode. The experimental measurements are conducted
   primarily by using a calibrated capacitive probe and back current
   shunts. The numerical modelling focuses on the fast ionization wave
   (FIW) and the plasma properties in the immediate afterglow after the

Title = {{Estimation of expected human attention weights based on a decision field

Abstract = {{Modeling human decision making behavior is of great interest in
   understanding how a decision maker weights different decision attributes
   when making a decision. Such knowledge is critically important in
   helping predict future decisions, evaluating human decision performance,
   and improving the design of human and machine interface systems.
   Decision field theory (DFT) provides a psychological representation of
   the cognitive deliberation process, which is driven by the fluctuations
   of a person's attention among decision attributes. In this research
   area, the most common use of a DFT model is to estimate or predict the
   human decisions by using a set of pre-specified expected attention
   weights (EAWs) in the DFT model. Unlike other research, this paper
   extends the capabilities of DFT in a complementary direction, showing
   how to fit or train a DFT model by estimating the EAW based on
   sequentially obtained samples of decision trials. Furthermore, the
   inherent connection between the EAW and the decision choice uncertainty
   is investigated. The proposed modeling method is discussed in detail for
   a two-alternative decision scenario based on two attributes. Both
   simulations and a case study are conducted in the paper to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cavitation clouds generated by short, high-amplitude, focused ultrasound
   pulses were previously observed to attract, trap, and erode thrombus
   fragments in a vessel phantom. This phenomenon may offer a noninvasive
   method to capture and eliminate embolic fragments flowing through the
   bloodstream during a cardiovascular intervention. In this article, the
   mechanism of embolus trapping was explored by particle image velocimetry
   (PIV). PIV was used to examine the fluid streaming patterns generated by
   ultrasound in a vessel phantom with and without crossflow of
   blood-mimicking fluid. Cavitation enhanced streaming, which generated
   fluid vortices adjacent to the focus. The focal streaming velocity,
   u(f), was as high as 120 cm/s, while mean crossflow velocities, u(c),
   were imposed up to 14 cm/s. When a solid particle 3-4 mm diameter was
   introduced into crossflow, it was trapped near the focus. Increasing
   u(f) promoted particle trapping while increasing u(c) promoted particle
   escape. The maximum crossflow Reynolds number at which particles could
   be trapped, Re-c, was approximately linear with focal streaming number,
   Re-f, i.e. Re-c = 0.25Re(f) + 67.44 (R-2 = 0.76) corresponding to
   dimensional velocities uc = 0.084u(f) + 3.122 for 20 < u(f) < 120 cm/s.
   The fluidic pressure map was estimated from PIV and indicated a negative
   pressure gradient towards the focus, trapping the embolus near this
   location.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{4945-4959}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Geometric accuracy of MRI is one of the main concerns for its use as a
   sole image modality in precision radiation therapy (RT) planning. In a
   state-of-the-art scanner, system level geometric distortions are within
   acceptable levels for precision RT. However, subject-induced B-0
   inhomogeneity may vary substantially, especially in air-tissue
   interfaces. Recent studies have shown distortion levels of more than 2
   mm near the sinus and ear canal are possible due to subject-induced
   field inhomogeneity. These distortions can be corrected with the use of
   accurate B-0 inhomogeneity field maps. Most existing methods estimate
   these field maps from dual gradient-echo (GRE) images acquired at two
   different echo-times under the assumption that the GRE images are
   practically undistorted. However distortion that may exist in the GRE
   images can result in estimated field maps that are distorted in both
   geometry and intensity, leading to inaccurate correction of clinical
   images. This work proposes a method for estimating undistorted field
   maps from GRE acquisitions using an iterative joint estimation
   technique. The proposed method yields geometrically corrected GRE images
   and undistorted field maps that can also be used for the correction of
   images acquired by other sequences. The proposed method is validated
   through simulation, phantom experiments and applied to patient data. Our
   simulation results show that our method reduces the root-mean-squared
   error of the estimated field map from the ground truth by ten-fold
   compared to the distorted field map. Both the geometric distortion and
   the intensity corruption (artifact) in the images caused by the B0 field
   inhomogeneity are corrected almost completely. Our phantom experiment
   showed improvement in the geometric correction of approximately 1 mm at
   an air-water interface using the undistorted field map compared to using
   a distorted field map. The proposed method for undistorted field map
   estimation can lead to improved geometric distortion correction at
   air-tissue interfaces, especially in low readout-bandwidth acquisitions,
   thus making them suitable for clinical use in precision RT without
   increasing the treatment planning margin.}},

Abstract = {{Injection of powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorbents into the flue
   gas of coal fired power plants with electrostatic precipitators (ESPs)
   is the most mature technology to control mercury emissions for coal
   combustion. However, the PAC itself can penetrate ESPs to emit into the
   atmosphere. These emitted PACs have similar size and optical properties
   to submicron black carbon (BC) and thus could increase BC radiative
   forcing unintentionally. The present paper estimates, for the first
   time, the potential emission of PAC together with their climate forcing.
   The global average maximum potential emissions of PAC is 98.4 Gg/yr for
   the year 2030, arising from the assumed adoption of the maximum
   potential PAC injection technology, the minimum collection efficiency,
   and the maximum PAC injection rate. These emissions cause a global
   warming of 2.10 mW m(-2) at the top of atmosphere and a cooling of -2.96
   mW m(-2) at the surface. This warming represents about 2\% of the
   warming that is caused by BC from direct fossil fuel burning and 0.86\%
   of the warming associated with CO2 emissions from coal burning in power
   plants. Its warming is 8 times more efficient than the emitted CO2 as
   measured by the 20-year-integrated radiative forcing per unit of carbon
   input (the 20-year Global Warming Potential).}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a framework for simulation-based design
   optimization of computationally expensive problems, where economizing
   the generation of sample designs is highly desirable. One popular
   approach for such problems is efficient global optimization (EGO), where
   an initial set of design samples is used to construct a kriging model,
   which is then used to generate new `infill' sample designs at regions of
   the search space where there is high expectancy of improvement. This
   article attempts to address one of the limitations of EGO, where
   generation of infill samples can become a difficult optimization problem
   in its own right, as well as allow the generation of multiple samples at
   a time in order to take advantage of parallel computing in the
   evaluation of the new samples. The proposed approach is tested on
   analytical functions, and then applied to the vehicle crashworthiness
   design of a full Geo Metro model undergoing frontal crash conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This work employs in situ measurement data and constructive simulations
   to examine the underlying physical mechanisms that drive spacecraft
   plume interactions with the space environment in low-Earth orbit. The
   study centers on observations of the enhanced flux of plasma generated
   during a maneuver of Space Shuttle Endeavour as part of the Sensor Test
   for Orion Relative Navigation Risk Mitigation experiment in May 2011.
   The Canary electrostatic analyzer (ESA) instrument mounted on the
   portside truss of the International Space Station indicated an elevated
   ion current during the shuttle maneuver. The apparent source of enhanced
   ion current is a result of interaction of the spacecraft thruster plume
   with the rarefied ambient ionosphere, which generates regions of
   relatively high density plasma through charge exchange between the
   neutral plume and ambient ions. To reconstruct this event, unsteady
   simulation data were generated using a combined direct simulation Monte
   Carlo/particle-in-cell methodology, which employed detailed charge
   exchange cross-section data and a magnetic field model. The simulation
   provides local plasma characteristics at the ESA sensor location, and a
   sensor model is subsequently used to transform the local properties into
   a prediction of measured ion current. The predicted and observed total
   currents are presented as a function of time over a 30 s period of
   pulsed thruster firings. A strong correlation is observed in the
   temporal characteristics of the simulated and measured total current,
   and good agreement is also achieved in the total current predicted by
   the model. These results support conclusions that (1) the enhanced flux
   of plasma observed by the ESA instrument is associated with Space
   Shuttle thruster firings and (2) the simulation model captures the
   essential features of the plume interactions based on the observation
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Approximate computing, where computation accuracy is traded off for
   better performance or higher data throughput, is one solution that can
   help data processing keep pace with the current and growing abundance of
   information. For particular domains, such as multimedia and learning
   algorithms, approximation is commonly used today. We consider automation
   to be essential to provide transparent approximation, and we show that
   larger benefits can be achieved by constructing the approximation
   techniques to fit the underlying hardware. Our target platform is the
   GPU because of its high performance capabilities and difficult
   programming challenges that can be alleviated with proper automation.
   Our approach-SAGE-combines a static compiler that automatically
   generates a set of CUDA kernels with varying levels of approximation
   with a runtime system that iteratively selects among the available
   kernels to achieve speedup while adhering to a target output quality set
   by the user. The SAGE compiler employs three optimization techniques to
   generate approximate kernels that exploit the GPU microarchitecture:
   selective discarding of atomic operations, data packing, and thread
   fusion. Across a set of machine learning and image processing kernels,
   SAGE's approximation yields an average of 2.5x speedup with less than
   10\% quality loss compared to the accurate execution on a NVIDIA GTX 560
   GPU.}},

Title = {{Virtual Retrofit Model for aging commercial buildings in a smart grid

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{80}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The economic and environmental benefits of building retrofits have been
   acknowledged. However, there is a series of barriers that threaten to
   impede implementing successful retrofit projects such as: lack of
   funding, lack of interoperability, and unstructured decision making.
   This paper aims to address these barriers by providing the framework of
   the Virtual Retrofit Model (VRM), an affordable computational platform
   that supports streamlined decision making for building retrofit
   projects. An occupant survey was implemented to identify the primary
   requirements and perceptions from different types of stakeholders of the
   buildings. The responses were analyzed to identify the most important
   criteria of the future retrofit projects to focus on if it were to be
   renovated in the future. A case study approach was used to describe the
   outcomes from a year-long demonstration project that has been conducted
   at an aging commercial building. The research activities focused on
   integrating theories and technologies of Building Information Modeling
   (BIM), energy simulation, agent-based modeling, multi-criteria decision
   support system, and software application that can be employed and
   adopted in building retrofit projects. The software prototype is
   designed to connect buildings to a smart grid environment where building
   energy data should be shared for intelligent decision making. (C) 2014

Title = {{Comparative Study of Motion Features for Similarity-Based Modeling and
   Classification of Unsafe Actions in Construction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Rapid development of motion sensors and video processing has triggered
   growing attention to action recognition for safety and health analysis,
   as well as operation analysis, in construction. Specifically for
   occupational safety and health, worker behavior monitoring allows for
   the automatic detection of workers' unsafe actions and for feedback on
   their behavior, both of which enable the proactive prevention of an
   accident by reducing the number of unsafe actions that occur. Previous
   studies provide insight into tracking human movements and recognizing
   actions, but further research efforts are needed to understand the
   following characteristics of motion data, which can significantly affect
   classification performances: (1) various motion data types extracted
   from motion capture data, (2) variations of postures and actions, and
   (3) temporal and sequential relations of motion data. This paper thus
   presents a modeling and classification methodology for the recognition
   of unsafe actions, particularly focusing on (1) the description and
   comparison of four motion data types (i.e., rotation angles, joint
   angles, position vectors, and movement direction) that will be used as a
   feature for classification, (2) the estimation of actions' mean
   trajectory in order to model various patterns of action, and (3) the
   classification of actions based on spatial-temporal similarity. With a
   concentration on motion analysis, experiments were undertaken for the
   modeling and detection of actions during ladder climbing using an red,
   green, blue plus depth (RGB-D) sensor. Through the experimental study,
   we found that the proposed approach performs well (i.e., an accuracy of
   up to 99.5\% in lab experiments), that a rotation angle outperforms a
   joint angle and a position vector, and that movement direction
   explicitly improves the accuracy of motion classification as combined
   with each of the other three. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{The design of satellites and their operation is a complex task that
   involves a large number of variables and multiple engineering
   disciplines. Thus, it could benefit from the application of
   multidisciplinary design optimization, but previous efforts have been
   hindered by the complexity of the modeling and implementation,
   discontinuities in the design space, and the wide range of time scales.
   We address these issues by applying a new mathematical framework for
   gradient-based multidisciplinary optimization that automatically
   computes the coupled derivatives of the multidisciplinary system via a
   generalized form of the adjoint method. The modeled disciplines are
   orbit dynamics, attitude dynamics, cell illumination, temperature, solar
   power, energy storage, and communication. Many of these disciplines
   include functions with discontinuities and nonsmooth regions that are
   addressed to enable a numerically exact computation of the derivatives
   for all of the modeled variables. The wide-ranging time scales in the
   design problem, spanning 30 s to one year, are captured through a
   combination of multipoint optimization and the use of a small time step
   in the analyses. Optimizations involving over 25,000 design variables
   and 2.2 million state variables require 100 h to converge three and five
   orders of magnitude in optimality and feasibility, respectively. The
   results show that the geometric design variables yield a 40\%
   improvement in the total data downloaded, which is the objective
   function, and the operational design variables yield another 40\%
   improvement. This demonstrates not only the value in this approach for
   the design of satellites and their operation, but also promise for its
   application to the design of other large-scale engineering systems.}},

Pages = {{1721-1734}},

Abstract = {{Spaceflight cables are investigated to determine the effect of bakeout
   on their dynamic response, including resonant frequencies and damping
   ratios. The addition of cable harnesses to spacecraft structures can
   affect the dynamic response of the entire structure, especially for
   lightweight structures with high cable mass ratios. Bakeout, a heat and
   vacuum treatment that spaceflight components must undergo, may change
   the dynamic stiffness of flight cables and thus the dynamics of the
   cabled host structure. Bakeout effects are examined by experimentally
   identifying natural frequencies and damping values for spaceflight
   cables before and after the bakeout process. After bakeout, the first
   natural frequency decreases by an average of 14\% for all single-strand
   cables and by 24\% for multistrand cables. The second natural frequency
   decreases by 8 to 17\% for all cables. Bakeout also increases the
   damping percentage for single and multistrand cables. These results show
   that bakeout affects the dynamic response of spaceflight cables
   significantly and should be taken into account when using cable data for
   design purposes.}},

   stabilize otherwise string unstable vehicle platoons. Exploiting the
   flexibility of ad-hoc connectivity, CCC can be applied in a large

   bioanalyte present inside. As a result, bioanalytes can now reflect
   their acoustic properties on the optomechanical vibrational spectrum of
   the device, in addition to optical property measurements with existing
   optofluidics techniques. In this work, we investigate acoustic sensing
   capabilities of OMFRs using computational eigenfrequency analysis. We
   analyze the OMFR eigenfrequency sensitivity to bulk fluid-phase
   materials as well as nanoparticles, and propose methods to extract
   multiple acoustic parameters from multiple vibrational modes. The new
   informational degrees-of-freedom provided by such opto-acoustic
   measurements could lead to surprising new sensor applications in the
   near future.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) lasing from
   self-assembled tetrahedral DNA complexes labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes

   deposited on a superhydrophobic surface. Threshold fluence and
   differential efficiency are characterized for DNA complexes containing
   1Cy3-3Cy5 and 3Cy3-1Cy5. We demonstrate that at a constant Cy5
   concentration, average threshold fluence is reduced 3 to 8 times and
   average differential efficiency is enhanced 6 to 30 times for 3Cy3-1Cy5
   as compared to 1Cy3-3Cy5. Using 3Cy3-1Cy5 nanostructures, FRET lasing is
   observed at very low concentrations down to similar to 1 mu M. This work
   shows that optofluidic microlasers based on droplet resonators can be
   combined with DNA nanotechnology to explore applications in bio/chemical

Abstract = {{This paper studies the scaling of airplane dynamic response to
   stochastic wind gusts, with focus on the relationship between airplane
   size and airspeed variations. The results have applications in the
   design and control of small-scale aircraft for robustness with respect
   to turbulence. Using linearized equations of motion and the Dryden model
   of gusts, the paper presents analytical and numerical scaling laws for
   the phugoid natural frequency and damping ratio, and the variances of
   the airspeed and flight-path angle. The results show that small aircraft
   are more susceptible to high frequency gusts, that the phugoid damping
   ratio does not depend directly on airplane size, that the airspeed and
   flight-path angle variances can be parameterized by the ratio of the
   phugoid natural frequency to a characteristic turbulence frequency, and
   that the coefficient of variation of the airspeed decreases with
   increasing airplane size. Numerical examples validate the results using
   models of 11 different airplanes, particularly the NASA Generic
   Transport Model, a hypothetical transport aircraft similar to a Boeing
   757, and the NASA T2 subscale jet transport, an operational 5.5\% scale
   model of the Generic Transport Model.}},

Abstract = {{The blended wing body is an aircraft configuration that has the
   potential to be more efficient than conventional large transport
   aircraft configurations with the same capability. However, the design of
   the blended wing is challenging due to the tight coupling between
   aerodynamic performance, trim, and stability. Other design challenges
   include the nature and number of the design variables involved, and the
   transonic flow conditions. To address these issues, a series of
   aerodynamic shape optimization studies using Reynolds-averaged
   Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics with a Spalart-Allinaras
   turbulence model is performed. A gradient-based optimization algorithm
   is used in conjunction with a discrete adjoint method that computes the
   derivatives of the aerodynamic forces. A total of 273 design variables -
   twist, airfoil shape, sweep, chord, and span are considered. The drag
   coefficient at the cruise condition is minimized subject to lift, trim,
   static margin, and center plane bending moment constraints. The studies
   investigate the impact of the various constraints and design variables
   on optimized blended-wing-body configurations. The lowest drag among the
   trimmed and stable configurations is obtained by enforcing a 1\% static
   margin constraint, resulting in a nearly elliptical spanwise lift
   distribution. Trim and static stability are investigated at both on- and
   off-design flight conditions. The single-point designs are relatively
   robust to the flight conditions, but further robustness is achieved
   through a multipoint optimization.}},

Abstract = {{We report the development of an add-on, chip-based, optical

   array of ball mini-lenses that are assembled onto a microfluidic silicon
   chip. The mini-lenses are made out of high refractive index material
   (sapphire) and they are half immersed in oil. Those two key features
   enable submicron resolution and a maximum numerical aperture of similar
   to 1.2. The mu OIL chip is reusable and easy to operate as it can be
   placed directly on top of any biological sample. It improves the
   resolution of a stereo microscope by an order of magnitude without
   compromising the field of view; therefore, we believe it could become a

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Organic light-emitting diodes are a major driving force of the current
   information display revolution due to their low power consumption and
   potentially long operational lifetime. Although electrophosphorescent
   organic emitters have significantly lower power consumption than
   fluorescent emitters, the short lifetime of electrophosphorescent blue
   devices has prevented their application in displays for more than a
   decade. Here, we demonstrate a novel blue electrophosphorescent device
   with a graded dopant concentration profile in a broadened emissive
   layer, leading to a lower exciton density compared with a conventional
   device. Thus, triplet-polaron annihilation that leads to long-term
   luminescent degradation is suppressed, resulting in a more than
   threefold lifetime improvement. When this strategy is applied to a
   two-unit stacked device, we demonstrate a lifetime of 616 +/- 10 h (time
   to 80\% of the 1,000 cd m(-2) initial luminance) with chromaticity
   coordinates of {[}0.15, 0.29], representing a tenfold lifetime
   improvement over a conventional blue electrophosphorescent device.}},

   a similar duct and pipe with bottom heating is observed. The velocity
   field is a combination of convection-modified streamwise flow and
   convection-induced circulation in the transverse plane. The circulation
   has strong jets near the heated and horizontal walls as prominent
   features. It is demonstrated that, at a constant Reynolds number,
   integral characteristics and spatial structure of the flow can be
   approximately considered as determined by Gr/Ha(2) as a single
   parameter. We also present results of a systematic comparison study of
   several commonly used grid clustering schemes in their application to
   wall-bounded flows with strong magnetic fields. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{The exploitation of nonlinear behavior in vibration-based energy
   harvesters has received much attention over the last decade. One key
   motivation is that the presence of nonlinearities can potentially
   increase the bandwidth over which the excitation is amplified and
   therefore the efficiency of the device. In the literature, references to
   resonating energy harvesters featuring nonlinear oscillators are common.
   In the majority of the reported studies, the harvester powers purely
   resistive loads. Given the complex behavior of nonlinear energy
   harvesters, it is difficult to identify the optimum load for this kind
   of device. In this paper the aim is to find the optimal load for a
   nonlinear energy harvester in the case of purely resistive loads. This
   work considers the analysis of a nonlinear energy harvester with
   hardening compliance and electromagnetic transduction under the
   assumption of negligible inductance. It also introduces a methodology
   based on numerical continuation which can be used to find the optimum
   load for a fixed sinusoidal excitation.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Optimizing and controlling electron energy distributions (EEDs) is a
   continuing goal in plasma materials processing as EEDs determine the
   rate coefficients for electron impact processes. There are many
   strategies to customize EEDs in low pressure inductively coupled plasmas
   (ICPs), for example, pulsing and choice of frequency, to produce the
   desired plasma properties. Recent experiments have shown that EEDs in
   low pressure ICPs can be manipulated through the use of static magnetic
   fields of sufficient magnitudes to magnetize the electrons and confine
   them to the electromagnetic skin depth. The EED is then a function of
   the local magnetic field as opposed to having non-local properties in
   the absence of the magnetic field. In this paper, EEDs in a magnetized
   inductively coupled plasma (mICP) sustained in Ar are discussed with
   results from a two-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model. Results are
   compared with experimental measurements. We found that the character of
   the EED transitions from non-local to local with application of the
   static magnetic field. The reduction in cross-field mobility increases
   local electron heating in the skin depth and decreases the transport of
   these hot electrons to larger radii. The tail of the EED is therefore
   enhanced in the skin depth and depressed at large radii. Plasmas
   densities are non-monotonic with increasing pressure with the external
   magnetic field due to transitions between local and non-local kinetics.

Title = {{Height stabilization of GaSb/GaAs quantum dots by Al-rich capping}},
Journal = {{APL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{GaSb quantum dots (QDs) in a GaAs matrix are investigated with
   cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy (X-STM) and
   photoluminescence (PL). We observe that Al-rich capping materials
   prevent destabilization of the nanostructures during the capping stage
   of the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth process and thus preserves
   the QD height. However, the strain induced by the absence of
   destabilization causes many structural defects to appear around the
   preserved QDs. These defects originate from misfit dislocations near the
   GaSb/GaAs interface and extend into the capping layer as stacking
   faults. The lack of a red shift in the QD PL suggests that the preserved
   dots do not contribute to the emission spectra. We suggest that a better
   control over the emission wavelength and an increase of the PL intensity
   is attainable by growing smaller QDs with an Al-rich overgrowth. (C)

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{5095-5115}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A unified approach is presented for the derivation of reliability
   function lower bounds for the two-user discrete memoryless (DM)
   multiple-access channel (MAC). In particular, three lower bounds are
   presented. The first one (random coding) is identical to the best known
   lower bound on the reliability function of DM-MACs. It is shown that the
   random coding bound characterizes the performance of the average code in
   the constant-type code ensemble. The second bound (typical random
   coding) characterizes the typical performance (the performance of a high
   probability subset of the ensemble) of the constant-type code ensemble.
   To derive the third bound (expurgated), we eliminate some of the
   codewords from each of the codebooks. This is the first bound of this
   type that explicitly uses the method of expurgation for DM-MACs. It is
   shown that the exponent of the typical random coding and the expurgated
   bounds are greater than or equal to the exponent of the known random
   coding bounds for all rate pairs. Moreover, an example is given where
   the exponent of the expurgated bound is strictly larger for a certain
   input distribution. Each of the presented bounds is universal in the
   sense that there exists a code that attains the bound for all channels
   with given input and output alphabets. The approach presented for the
   DM-MAC is first demonstrated for the point-to-point discrete memoryless
   channel (DMC), by rederiving the random coding and expurgated exponents,
   and deriving a bound that characterizes the typical performance of the
   constant-type code ensemble.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{211}},
Pages = {{84-98}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We study polymer migration in a periodic pressure-driven sudden
   contraction-expansion flow with contraction dimension comparable to the
   polymer radius of gyration, for which several polymer migration
   mechanisms can be important: (1) sieving by the thin channel of polymers
   too large to easily enter them; (2) deformation-hydrodynamic coupling,
   including wall-hydrodynamic interaction, which causes polymers to drift
   away from the walls towards the center of the channel; (3)
   streamline-curvature-induced migration, in which polymers traveling
   along curved streamlines migrate towards the center of curvature; and
   (4) depletion-convection coupling, in which depletion layers in thin
   channels are convected across wide side chambers, creating a one-sided
   diffusion barrier that leads to depletion from the side chamber. We use
   both Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRD), which includes hydrodynamic
   interaction (HI), and simple Brownian dynamics (BD), with HI omitted and
   flow field given by finite element analysis. The similarity in results
   from SRD and BD at Weissenberg number Wi less than 10 (where Wi is based
   on the shear rate in the narrow region of the contraction channel) shows
   that HI (Mechanism 2) has only a weak effect on polymer migration in our
   tight geometry. At Wi > 1, the polymer migrates towards the centerline
   in the wide region, due mainly to streamline-curvature-induced (SCI)
   migration (Mechanism 3), but also to depletion-convection-induced
   migration (Mechanism 4). And we demonstrate these two mechanisms more
   explicitly in a pressure-driven flow in a grooved channel that is
   significantly wider than the polymer. SCI migration dominates in the
   contraction geometry, and produces a migration velocity proportional to
   Wi(2). Using the central limit theorem, we accurately predict the
   position and width of a band of polymer passing through N periodic
   contractions, thereby demonstrating the potential for SCI migration as a
   mechanism of size separation in a multi-step planar contraction channel.
   We find that the best separation is achieved at Wi around 2, where SCI
   migration has the greatest resolving power between polymers of different
   size. We also find that sieving (Mechanism 1) is dominant at low Wi less
   than unity, where the chains with large radius of gyration are delayed
   in their entry to the thin channel, relative to shorter polymers. This
   sieving separation mechanism differs from that of size-exclusion
   chromatography which yields faster migration by the shorter chains. Our
   strategy of combining simulation methods with the central limit theorem
   could also be used to predict separation efficiencies of a wide variety
   of polymers and colloids in microfluidic geometries. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The diversity of precision motion control applications and their
   demanding design specifications pose a large array of control
   challenges. Hence, precision motion control design relies on a variety
   of advanced control strategies developed to cope with specific problems
   present in control theory. A popular feedforward control technique for
   repetitive systems is iterative learning control (ILC). While ILC can
   decrease tracking errors up to several orders of magnitude, the
   achievable performance is limited by dynamic uncertainty. We propose the
   combination of L-1 adaptive control (L-1 AC) and linear ILC for
   precision motion control under parametric uncertainties. We rely on the
   adaptive loop to compensate for parametric uncertainties, and ensure
   that the plant uncertainty is sufficiently small so that an aggressive
   learning controller can be designed on the nominal system. We exploit
   the closed loop stability condition of L-1 AC to design simple, robust
   ILC update laws that reduce tracking errors to measurement noise for
   time varying references and uncertainties. We demonstrate in simulation
   that the combined control scheme maintains a highly predictable,
   monotonic system behavior; and achieves near perfect tracking within a
   few trials regardless of the uncertainty present. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Automatically identifying the sentiment polarity of words is a very
   important task that has been used as the essential building block of
   many natural language processing systems such as text classification,
   text filtering, product review analysis, survey response analysis, and
   on-line discussion mining. We propose a method for identifying the
   sentiment polarity of words that applies a Markov random walk model to a
   large word relatedness graph, and produces a polarity estimate for any
   given word. The model can accurately and quickly assign a polarity sign
   and magnitude to any word. It can be used both in a semi-supervised
   setting where a training set of labeled words is used, and in a weakly
   supervised setting where only a handful of seed words is used to define
   the two polarity classes. The method is experimentally tested using a
   gold standard set of positive and negative words from the General
   Inquirer lexicon. We also show how our method can be used for three-way
   classification which identifies neutral words in addition to positive
   and negative words. Our experiments show that the proposed method
   outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the semi-supervised setting
   and is comparable to the best reported values in the weakly supervised
   setting. In addition, the proposed method is faster and does not need a
   large corpus. We also present extensions of our methods for identifying
   the polarity of foreign words and out-of-vocabulary words.}},

Abstract = {{The recent expansion of unconventional natural gas production in the
   United States has enabled a steady increase of its use in all
   consumption sectors, including transportation. In this study, the
   environmental footprints of three natural gas-based personal mobility
   options are examined from a life cycle perspective: battery electric
   vehicles (BEVs), compressed natural gas vehicles (CNGVs), and fuel cell
   vehicles (FCVs). The results suggest that natural gas-powered vehicles
   have the potential to considerably reduce the overall environmental
   impact associated with driven miles in comparison to conventional
   petroleum-powered internal combustion engine vehicles (PICVs). BEVs and
   FCVs in particular offer significant reductions in greenhouse gas
   emissions, especially if carbon capture and sequestration (CCS)
   technologies are implemented at the fuel conversion facilities. It was
   furthermore determined that the use phase dominates the life cycle
   impacts of all of the vehicles considered, although the manufacture of
   power sources for BEVs and FCVs significantly contributes to their
   respective environmental burdens. Efforts presently being exerted for
   the greener manufacture and more efficient powertrain design of BEVs and
   FCVs are likely to further extend their environmental advantages over
   CNGVs for the utilization of natural gas as a transportation energy
   resource.}},

Abstract = {{Parallel transmit is an emerging technology to address the technical
   challenges associated with MR imaging at high field strengths. When
   developing arrays for parallel transmit systems, one of the primary
   factors to be considered is the mechanism to manage coupling and create
   independently operating channels. Recent work has demonstrated the use
   of amplifiers to provide some or all of the channel-to-channel
   isolation, reducing the need for on-coil decoupling networks in a manner
   analogous to the use of isolation preamplifiers with receive coils. This
   paper discusses an eight-channel transmit/receive head array for use
   with an ultra-low output impedance (ULOI) parallel transmit system. The
   ULOI amplifiers eliminated the need for a complex lumped element network
   to decouple the eight-rung array. The design and construction details of
   the array are discussed in addition to the measurement considerations
   required for appropriately characterizing an array when using ULOI
   amplifiers. B-1 maps and coupling matrices are used to verify the
   performance of the system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a model gel system in which colloidal forces, structure,
   and rheology are measured by balancing the requirements of rheological
   and microscopy techniques with those of optical tweezers. Sterically
   stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate) colloids are suspended in
   cyclohexane (CH) and cyclohexyl bromide (CHB) with dilute polystyrene
   serving as a depletion agent. A study of the optical trap strength,
   rheology, and microscopic structure of the gels as a function of CH/CHB
   solvent composition identifies the conditions for which these
   measurements can be applied to characterize gel properties. The results
   indicate that a solvent comprising 37\% weight fraction CH (w(CH) =
   0.37) provides sufficient refractive index contrast to enable optical
   trapping, while maintaining good confocal microscopy imaging quality and
   minimal sedimentation effects on the bulk rheology. At this condition,
   and at a depletant concentration c = 8.64 mg/ml (c/c{*} = 0.81), results
   from optical trapping in a dilute sample show that 50\% of bonds rupture
   at (3.3 +/- 0.5) pN. The linear strain-dependent elastic modulus of the
   corresponding gel (phi = 0.20) is G' = (1.8 +/- 0.6) Pa, and the mean
   contact number of the colloids in the gel structure is < z > = 5.4 +/-
   0.1. The development of this model colloidal gel system yields a
   concomitant characterization of the interparticle forces,
   microstructure, and bulk rheology in a single experimental system,
   thereby allowing the simultaneous comparison of these different
   measures. (C) 2014 The Society of Rheology.}},

Title = {{Amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O thin-film transistor active pixel sensor x-ray
   imager for digital breast tomosynthesis}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The breast cancer detection rate for digital breast
   tomosynthesis (DBT) is limited by the x-ray image quality. The limiting
   Nyquist frequency for current DBT systems is around 5 lp/mm, while the
   fine image details contained in the high spatial frequency region (>5
   lp/mm) are lost. Also today the tomosynthesis patient dose is high
   (0.67-3.52 mGy). To address current issues, in this paper, for the first
   time, a high-resolution low-dose organic photodetector/amorphous
   In-Ga-Zn-O thin-film transistor (a-IGZO TFT) active pixel sensor (APS)
   x-ray imager is proposed for next generation DBT systems.
   Methods: The indirect x-ray detector is based on a combination of a
   novel low-cost organic photodiode (OPD) and a cesium iodide-based (CsI:
   Tl) scintillator. The proposed APS x-ray imager overcomes the difficulty
   of weak signal detection, when small pixel size and low exposure
   conditions are used, by an on-pixel signal amplification with a
   significant charge gain. The electrical performance of a-IGZO TFT APS
   pixel circuit is investigated by SPICE simulation using modified
   Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) TFT model.
   Finally, the noise, detective quantum efficiency (DQE), and
   resolvability of the complete system are modeled using the cascaded
   system formalism.
   Results: The result demonstrates that a large charge gain of 31-122 is
   achieved for the proposed high-mobility (5-20 cm(2)/V s) amorphous
   metal-oxide TFT APS. The charge gain is sufficient to eliminate the TFT
   thermal noise, flicker noise as well as the external readout circuit
   noise. Moreover, the low TFT (<10(-13) A) and OPD (< 10(-8) A/cm(2))
   leakage currents can further reduce the APS noise. Cascaded system
   analysis shows that the proposed APS imager with a 75 mu m pixel pitch
   can effectively resolve the Nyquist frequency of 6.67 lp/mm, which can
   be further improved to similar to 10 lp/mm if the pixel pitch is reduced
   to 50 mu m. Moreover, the detector entrance exposure per projection can
   be reduced from 1 to 0.3 mR without a significant reduction of DQE. The
   signal-to-noise ratio of the a-IGZO APS imager under 0.3 mR x-ray
   exposure is comparable to that of a-Si:H passive pixel sensor imager
   under 1 mR, indicating good image quality under low dose. A threefold
   reduction of current tomosynthesis dose is expected if proposed
   technology is combined with an advanced DBT image reconstruction method.
   Conclusions: The proposed a-IGZO APS x-ray imager with a pixel pitch <
   75 mu m is capable to achieve a high spatial frequency (>6.67 lp/mm) and
   a low dose (<0.4 mGy) in next generation DBT systems. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{The coarse-mesh finite difference (CMFD) and the coarse-mesh diffusion
   synthetic acceleration (CMDSA) methods are widely used, independently
   developed methods for accelerating the iterative convergence of
   deterministic neutron transport calculations. In this paper, we show
   that these methods have the following theoretical relationship: If the
   standard notion of diffusion synthetic acceleration as a fine-mesh
   method is straightforwardly generalized to a coarse-mesh method, then
   the linearized form of the CMFD method is algebraically equivalent to a
   CMDSA method. We also show theoretically (via Fourier analysis) and
   experimentally (via simulations) that for fixed-source problems, the
   CMDSA and CMFD methods have nearly identical convergence rates. Our
   numerical results confirm the close theoretically predicted relationship
   between these methods.}},

Abstract = {{Cytocompatible electrically conducting hydrogels based on amphoteric

   reaction via glutaraldehyde. The conductivities of the swollen hydrogels
   are between 1.14 x 10(-4) and 4.23 x 10(-4) S/cm by tuning the AP
   content. Swelling ratio was controlled by the AP content and
   crosslinking degree of the hydrogels. The hydrogels showed absorption
   capacity of diclofenac sodium (DCS) as a model molecule and released DCS
   in a controlled manner. Morphologies and mechanical properties of the
   hydrogels were characterized by SEM and rheometer, respectively. The
   biocompatibility of the hydrogels was confirmed by C2C12 myoblast cells

Abstract = {{A framework for aerothermoelastic-stability-boundary calculation for
   hypersonic configurations using computational fluid dynamics combined
   with radial basis functions for mesh deformation is developed.
   Application of computational fluid dynamics enables one to consider
   different turbulence conditions, laminar or turbulent, and different
   models of the air mixture, in particular real-gas model, which accounts
   for dissociation of molecules at high temperature. The effect of
   transition on the flutter margin of the heated structure is also
   considered using an uncertainty-propagation framework. The
   aerothermoelastic-stability margin of a three-dimensional
   low-aspect-ratio wing, representative of a control surface of a
   hypersonic vehicle, is investigated for various flight conditions. The
   system is found to be sensitive to turbulence modeling, as well as the
   location of the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Real-gas
   effects play a minor role for the flight conditions considered. This
   study demonstrates the advantages of accounting for uncertainty at an
   early stage of the analysis, and emphasizes the important relation
   between transition from laminar to turbulent, thermal stresses, and
   stability margins of hypersonic vehicles.}},

   Diclofenac sodium (DCS) as a model for small molecule water-soluble

Abstract = {{A 0.25 cm(3) autonomous energy harvesting micro-platform is realized to
   efficiently scavenge, rectify and store ambient vibration energy with
   batteryless cold start-up and zero sleep-mode power consumption. The
   fabricated compact system integrates a high-performance vacuum-packaged
   piezoelectric MEMS energy harvester with a power management IC and
   surface-mount components including an ultra-capacitor. The power
   management circuit incorporates a rectification stage with similar to 30
   mV voltage drop, a bias-flip stage with a novel control system for
   increased harvesting efficiency, a trickle charger for permanent storage
   of harvested energy, and a low power supply-independent bias circuitry.
   The overall system weighs less than 0.6 grams, does not require a
   pre-charged battery, and has power consumption of 0.5 mu W in
   active-mode and <10 pW in sleep-mode operation. While excited with 1 g
   vibration, the platform is tested to charge an initially depleted 70 mF
   ultra-capacitor to 1.85 V in 50 minutes (at 155 Hz vibration), and a 20
   mF ultra-capacitor to 1.35 V in 7.5 min (at 419 Hz). The end-to-end
   rectification efficiency from the harvester to the ultra-capacitor is
   measured as 58-86\%. The system can harvest from a minimum vibration
   level of 0.1 g.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents Razor-Lite, which is a low-overhead register for use
   in error detection and correction (EDAC) systems. These systems are able
   to eliminate timing margins by using specialized registers to detect
   setup time violations. However, these EDAC registers incur significant
   area and energy overheads, which mitigates some the system benefits.
   Razor-Lite is a new EDAC register that addresses this issue by adding
   only 8 additional transistors to a conventional flip-flop design. The
   Razor-Lite flip-flop achieves low overhead via a charge-sharing
   technique that attaches to a standard flip-flop without modifying its
   design. Side-channels connected to the floating nodes generate error
   flags through simple logic gates totaling 8 transistors, enabling
   register energy/area overheads of 2.7\%/33\% over a conventional DFF,
   while also not incurring extra clock or datapath loading or delay.
   Razor-Lite is demonstrated in a 7-stage Alpha architecture processor in
   a 45nm SOI CMOS technology with a measured energy improvement of 83\%
   while incurring a 4.4\% core area overhead compared to a baseline
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid prototyping (RP) fabrication techniques are currently widely used
   in diverse industrial and medical fields, providing substantial
   advantages in development time and costs in comparison to more
   traditional manufacturing processes. This paper presents a new method
   for the fabrication of high-intensity focused ultrasound transducers
   using RP technology. The construction of a large-aperture hemispherical
   transducer designed by computer software is described to demonstrate the
   process. The transducer was conceived as a modular design consisting of
   32 individually focused 50.8-mm (2-in) PZT-8 element modules distributed
   in a 300-mm hemispherical scaffold with a geometric focus of 150 mm. The
   entire structure of the array, including the module housings and the
   hemispherical scaffold was fabricated through a stereolithography (SLA)
   system using a proprietary photopolymer. The PZT elements were bonded to
   the lenses through a quarter-wave tungsten-epoxy matching layer
   developed in-house specifically for this purpose. Modules constructed in
   this manner displayed a high degree of electroacoustic consistency, with
   an electrical impedance mean and standard deviation of 109 +/- 10.2
   Omega for the 32 elements. Time-of-flight measurements for individually
   pulsed modules mounted on the hemispherical scaffold showed that all
   pulses arrived at the focus within a 350 ns range, indicating a good
   degree of element alignment. Pressure profile measurements of the fully
   assembled transducer also showed close agreement with simulated results.
   The measured focal beam FWHM dimensions were 1.9 x 4.0 mm (1.9 x 3.9 mm
   simulated) in the transversal and axial directions respectively. Total
   material expenses associated with the construction of the transducer
   were approximately 5000 USD (as of 2011). The versatility and lower
   fabrication costs afforded by RP methods may be beneficial in the
   development of complex transducer geometries suitable for a variety of
   research and clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{This research presents a methodology for optimal design of the needle
   geometry to minimize the insertion force and bevel length based on
   mathematical models of cutting edge inclination and rake angles and the
   insertion force. In brachytherapy, the needle with lower insertion force
   typically is easier for guidance and has less deflection. In this study,
   the needle with lancet point (denoted as lancet needle) is applied to
   demonstrate the model-based optimization for needle design. Mathematical
   models to calculate the bevel length and inclination and rake angles for
   lancet needle are presented. A needle insertion force model is developed
   to predict the insertion force for lancet needle. The genetic algorithm
   is utilized to optimize the needle geometry for two cases. One is to
   minimize the needle insertion force. Using the geometry of a commercial
   lancet needle as the baseline, the optimized needle has 11\% lower
   insertion force with the same bevel length. The other case is to
   minimize the bevel length under the same needle insertion force. The
   optimized design can reduce the bevel length by 46\%. Both optimized
   needle designs were validated experimentally in ex vivo porcine liver
   needle insertion tests and demonstrated the methodology of the
   model-based optimal needle design. (C) 2014 IPEM. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction is the limiting
   half-reaction for low-temperature hydrogen fuel cells, and currently
   costly Pt-based electrocatalysts are used to generate adequate rates.
   Although most other metals are not stable in typical acid-mediated
   cells, alkaline environments permit the use of less costly electrodes,
   such as silver. Unfortunately, monometallic silver is not sufficiently
   active for economical fuel cells. Herein we demonstrate the design of
   low-cost Ag-Co surface alloy nanoparticle electrocatalysts for oxygen
   reduction. Their performance relative to that of Pt is potential
   dependent, but reaches over half the area-specific activity of Pt
   nanoparticle catalysts and is more than a fivefold improvement over pure
   silver nanoparticles at typical operating potentials. The Ag-Co
   electrocatalyst was initially identified with quantum chemical
   calculations and then synthesized using a novel technique that generates
   a surface alloy, despite bulk immiscibility of the constituent
   materials. Characterization studies support the hypothesis that the
   activity improvement comes from a ligand effect, in which cobalt atoms
   perturb surface silver sites.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses high-resolution ultrasound to examine the growth and
   development of engineered oral mucosal tissues manufactured under
   aseptic conditions. The specimens are a commercially available natural
   tissue scaffold, AlloDerm, and oral keratinocytes seeded onto AlloDerm
   to form an ex vivo-produced oral mucosal equivalent (EVPOME) suitable
   for intra-oral grafting. The seeded cells produce a keratinized
   protective upper layer that smooths out any remaining surface
   irregularities on the underlying AlloDerm. Two-dimensional acoustic
   imaging of unseeded AlloDerm and developing EVPOMEs was performed on
   each day of their growth and development, each tissue specimen being
   imaged under aseptic conditions (total time from seeding to maturation:
   11 d). Ultrasonic monitoring offers us the ability to determine the
   constituents of the EVPOME that are responsible for changes in its
   mechanical behavior during the manufacturing process. Ultrasonic
   monitoring affords us an opportunity to non-invasively assess, in real
   time, tissue-engineered constructs before release for use in patient

Abstract = {{Cells can sense a myriad of mechanical stimuli. Mechanosensitive channel
   of large conductance (MscL) found in bacteria is a well-characterized
   mechanosensitive channel that rapidly responds to an increase in turgor
   pressure. Functional expression of MscL in mammalian cells has recently
   been demonstrated, revealing that molecular delivery or transport can be
   achieved by charge-induced activation of MscL. Despite a well-accepted
   mechanism for MscL activation by membrane tension in bacteria, it is not
   clear whether and how MscL can be opened by other modes of force
   transduction in mammalian cells. In this work, we used a variety of
   techniques to characterize the gating of MscL expressed in mammalian
   cells, using both wild type and a G22S mutant which activates at a lower
   threshold. In particular, employing a recently developed technique,
   acoustic tweezing cytometry (ATC), we show that ultrasound actuation of
   integrin-bound microbubbles can lead to MscL opening and that ATC
   induced MscL activation was dependent on the functional linkage of the
   microbubbles with an intact actin cytoskeleton. Our results indicate
   that localized mechanical stress can mediate opening of MscL that
   requires force transduction through the actin cytoskeleton, revealing a
   new mode of MscL activation that may prove to be a useful tool for
   mechanobiology and drug delivery research.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor spheroids are three-dimensional clusters of cancer cells that
   exhibit characteristics of poorly perfused tumors and hence present a
   relevant model for testing the efficacy of anti-cancer compounds. The
   use of spheroids for drug screening is hindered by technological
   complexities for high throughput generation of consistent size spheroids
   individually addressable by drug compounds. Here we present and optimize
   a simple spheroid technology based on the use of an aqueous two-phase
   system. Cancer cells confined in a drop of the denser aqueous dextran
   phase are robotically dispensed into a microwell containing the
   immersion aqueous polyethylene glycol phase. Cells remain within the
   drop and form a viable spheroid, without a need for any external
   stimuli. The size of resulting spheroids is sensitive to volume
   variations of dispensed drops from the air displacement pipetting head
   of a commercial liquid handling robot. Therefore, we parametrically
   optimize the process of dispensing of dextran phase drops. For a given
   cell density, this optimization reproducibly generates consistent size
   spheroids in standard 96-well plates. In addition, we evaluate the use
   of a commercial biochemical assay to examine cellular viability of
   cancer cell spheroids. Spheroids show a dose-dependent response to
   cisplatin similar to a monolayer culture. However unlike their
   two-dimensional counterpart, spheroids exhibit resistance to paclitaxel
   treatment. This technology, which uses only commercially-available
   reagents and equipment, can potentially expedite anti-cancer drug
   discovery. Although the use of robotics makes the ATPS spheroid
   technology particularly useful for drug screening applications, this
   approach is compatible with simpler liquid handling techniques such as
   manual micropipetting and offers a straightforward method of 3D cell
   culture in research laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examined the impact of stage of automation on the
   performance and perceived workload during simulated robotic arm control
   tasks in routine and off-nominal scenarios.
   Background: Automation varies with respect to the stage of information
   processing it supports and its assigned level of automation. Making
   appropriate choices in terms of stages and levels of automation is
   critical to ensure robust joint system performance. To date, this issue
   has been empirically studied in domains such as aviation and medicine
   but not extensively in the context of space operations.
   Method: A total of 36 participants played the role of a payload
   specialist and controlled a simulated robotic arm. Participants
   performed fly-to tasks with two types of automation (camera
   recommendation and trajectory control automation) of varying stage.
   Tasks were performed during routine scenarios and in scenarios in which
   either the trajectory control automation or a hazard avoidance
   automation failed.
   Results: Increasing the stage of automation progressively improved
   performance and lowered workload when the automation was reliable, but
   incurred severe performance costs when the system failed.
   Conclusion: The results from this study support concerns about
   automation-induced complacency and automation bias when later stages of
   automation are introduced. The benefits of such automation are offset by
   the risk of catastrophic outcomes when system failures go unnoticed or
   become difficult to recover from.
   Application: A medium stage of automation seems preferable as it
   provides sufficient support during routine operations and helps avoid
   potentially catastrophic outcomes in circumstances when the automation
   fails.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of designing (or augmenting) an electric power
   system at a minimum cost such that it satisfies the N - k-epsilon
   survivability criterion. This survivability criterion is a
   generalization of the well-known N - k criterion, and it requires that
   at least (1 - epsilon(j)) fraction of the steady-state demand be met
   after failures of j components, for j = 0, 1,..., k. The network design
   problem adds another level of complexity to the notoriously hard
   contingency analysis problem, since the contingency analysis is only one
   of the requirements for the design optimization problem. We present a
   mixed-integer programming formulation of this problem that takes into
   account both transmission and generation expansion. We propose an
   algorithm that can avoid combinatorial explosion in the number of
   contingencies, by seeking vulnerabilities in intermediary solutions and
   constraining the design space accordingly. Our approach is built on our
   ability to identify such system vulnerabilities quickly. Our empirical
   studies on modified instances of the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems
   show the effectiveness of our methods. We were able to solve the
   transmission and generation expansion problems for k = 4 in
   approximately 30 min, while other approaches failed to provide a
   solution at the end of 2 h.}},

Abstract = {{Low-temperature combustion has shown the potential to provide solutions
   for future clean and efficient powertrain systems. Traditional
   approaches using the first law of thermodynamics have been established
   for describing energy flows within engine systems and comparing losses
   between low-temperature and traditional combustion modes. An augmented
   approach, using the second law of thermodynamics, can be utilized to
   gain insight into the exergy flows within the system and thus identify
   areas of irreversibilities and inefficiencies. The present article aims
   at introducing the required framework for the second law analysis of
   low-temperature combustion concepts and demonstrating its application to
   boosted homogeneous charge compression ignition engines. The framework
   consists of a combination of the first law and second law expressions
   combined with the University of Michigan homogeneous charge compression
   ignition combustion model and was applied on a modeled light-duty
   four-cylinder boosted homogeneous charge compression ignition engine. It
   was found that combustion irreversibilities in homogeneous charge
   compression ignition were; 25\% more than traditional spark ignition or
   diesel engines and increased with dilution. On the other hand, exergy
   transfer to the walls was reduced with low-temperature combustion. It
   was also found that the combination of negative valve overlap and
   turbocharging is not beneficial for high-load operation. Exergy analysis
   of the exhaust system revealed that turbine useful work was lower than
   50\% of exergy at the exhaust ports and indicated that boosting
   performance may be improved by manipulating exergy transfer in the
   exhaust manifold. Results from the present study are focused on boosted
   homogeneous charge compression ignition, but the conclusions reached are
   applicable to other lowtemperature combustion concepts as well.}},

Abstract = {{Soot, mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon
   emissions are investigated as functions of fuel oxygen and engine load
   in a single-cylinder diesel engine operated in a premixed
   low-temperature combustion mode by isolating fuel oxygen from other fuel
   properties and removing or minimizing variations in engine combustion
   parameters. It is found that at high loads (high global equivalence
   ratios), soot is reduced as fuel oxygen increases. Over the load range
   tested, CO and hydrocarbon emissions are not affected by fuel oxygen
   fraction. NOx emission increases as load is decreased because intake
   composition changes. NOx emission is not directly affected by fuel
   oxygen. The difference in NOx emission among the different oxygen fuels
   is indirectly caused by different exhaust composition affecting intake
   composition. Combustion efficiency and indicated thermal efficiency are
   similar for the test fuels with different oxygen fractions.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes a technique to quantify muscle fascicle directions
   in the levator ani (LA) and tests the null hypothesis that the in vivo
   fascicle directions for each LA subdivision subtend the same

   Visible muscle fascicle direction in the each of the three LA muscle
   subdivisions, the pubovisceral (PVM; synonymous with pubococcygeal),
   puborectal (PRM), and iliococcygeal (ICM) muscles, as well as the
   external anal sphincter (EAS), were measured on 3-T sagittal MRI images
   in a convenience sample of 14 healthy women in whom muscle fascicles
   were visible. Mean +/- standard deviation (SD) angle values relative to
   the horizontal were calculated for each muscle subdivision. Repeated
   measures ANOVA and post-hoc paired t tests were used to compare muscle
   groups.
   Pubovisceral muscle fiber inclination was 41 +/- 8.0A degrees, PRM was
   -19 A +/- 10.1A degrees, ICM was 33 A +/- 8.8A degrees, and EAS was -43
   A +/- 6.4A degrees. These fascicle directions were statistically
   different (p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons among levator subdivisions
   showed angle differences of 60A degrees between PVM and PRM, and 52A
   degrees between ICM and PRM. An 84A degrees difference existed between
   PVM and EAS. The smallest angle difference between levator divisions was
   between PVM and ICM 8A degrees. The difference between PRM and EAS was
   24A degrees. All pairwise comparisons were significant (p < 0.001).
   The null hypothesis that muscle fascicle inclinations are similar in the
   three subdivisions of the levator ani and the external anal sphincter
   was rejected. The largest difference in levator subdivision inclination,
   60A degrees, was found between the PVM and PRM.}},

Abstract = {{Objective We describe experiments designed to determine the feasibility
   of distinguishing known from novel associations based on a clinical
   dataset comprised of International Classification of Disease, V.9
   (ICD-9) codes from 1.6 million patients by comparing them to
   associations of ICD-9 codes derived from 20.5 million Medline citations
   processed using MetaMap. Associations appearing only in the clinical
   dataset, but not in Medline citations, are potentially novel.
   Methods Pairwise associations of ICD-9 codes were independently
   identified in both the clinical and Medline datasets, which were then
   compared to quantify their degree of overlap. We also performed a manual
   review of a subset of the associations to validate how well MetaMap
   performed in identifying diagnoses mentioned in Medline citations that
   formed the basis of the Medline associations.
   Results The overlap of associations based on ICD-9 codes in the clinical
   and Medline datasets was low: only 6.6\% of the 3.1 million associations
   found in the clinical dataset were also present in the Medline dataset.
   Further, a manual review of a subset of the associations that appeared
   in both datasets revealed that co-occurring diagnoses from Medline
   citations do not always represent clinically meaningful associations.
   Discussion Identifying novel associations derived from large clinical
   datasets remains challenging. Medline as a sole data source for existing
   knowledge may not be adequate to filter out widely known associations.
   Conclusions In this study, novel associations were not readily
   identified. Further improvements in accuracy and relevance for tools
   such as MetaMap are needed to realize their expected utility.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The piezoelectric impedance-based method for damage detection is a
   promising approach in structural health monitoring by virtue of its
   potential to detect small-sized damages with a low-cost measurement
   circuit that enables remote monitoring. The amount of available
   impedance data, however, is generally far less than the number of
   required system parameters, which results in a highly underdetermined
   inverse problem for identifying the location and severity of the damage.
   This numerical ill-conditioning undermines the accuracy and reliability
   of damage prediction, particularly in practical implementations in which
   measurement noise and baseline modeling error are unavoidable. In this
   research paper, we propose a new concept to enrich the impedance
   measurement by incorporating an adaptive piezoelectric circuitry in the
   structure. This circuitry alters the dynamics of the integrated system,
   and by systematically tuning the inductance value, one can significantly
   increase the number of measurement sets. Thus, the previous seriously
   underdetermined inverse problem can be notably improved. As a result,
   the new method yields significantly more accurate damage location and
   severity identification. A numerical example of the damage prediction of
   a fixed-fixed beam using the spectral element method demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach. The concept is also verified via
   experimental investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured Cu-Ta alloys have shown promise as high-strength
   nanocrystalline materials in part due to their limited grain growth at

   consolidated into bulk nanostructured specimens using equal channel
   angular extrusion (ECAE) at high temperatures. Subsequent microstructure
   characterization indicated full consolidation, which resulted in an
   equiaxed grain structure for the Cu matrix along with the formation of
   fine Ta precipitates, the size distributions of which varied both with
   composition and processing temperature. Microhardness, compression and
   shear punch testing indicated, in some cases, an almost threefold
   increase in mechanical properties above that predicted by Hall-Petch
   estimates for pure nanocrystalline Cu. Stress relaxation tests
   substantiated the strain-hardening behavior and grain-size-dependent
   dislocation activity observed in the nanocrystalline Cu-Ta samples.

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Cyclic oxidation behavior of beta NiAlCr coatings was investigated at
   1150 degrees C with emphasis on effective Pd + Hf and Pt + Hf co-doping
   composition and the concomitant phase transformations and interdiffusion
   of Pd and Pt into the substrate. Coatings with compositions in the range
   of Ni-(33-39)Al-5Cr-(2-5)Pd/Pt were deposited on Rene N5 single-crystal
   substrates and subjected to long-term cyclic oxidation. The Pt + Hf- and
   Pd + Hf-modified overlay coatings exhibited comparable oxidation
   kinetics and matched the range of oxidation behavior exhibited by the
   standard Pt-aluminide coating. In particular, additions of about
   (2-5)Pd+(0.15-0.3)Hf and (2-5)Pt+(0.15-0.3)Hf among the studied
   composition range exhibited long lifetimes of >2000 oxidation cycles. A
   positive synergistic effect between Pd Hf and Pt Hf was clearly observed
   when comparing the lifetimes of beta NiAlCr-Pd and beta NiAlCr-Pt
   quaternary coatings with the quinary coatings. Transformations from beta
   -> 3R + 7R-martensites at low temperature and beta -> gamma' -> gamma +
   gamma' at high temperature occurred in both Pd- and Pt-modified coatings
   due to Al depletion to substrate and surface oxide. A greater depletion
   of Pd to the substrate compared to Pt was observed at 1150 degrees C
   compared to 1100 degrees C; the interdiffusion coefficients were
   consistent with those measured in NiAl-NiAl + Pt/Pd diffusion couples.
   These results are very encouraging in supporting the exploration of
   Pd-modified coating supplanting the currently used, expensive Pt-based
   coatings. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2242-2251}},

Abstract = {{Ignition properties of simulated syngas mixtures were systematically
   investigated at high-pressure low-temperature conditions relevant to gas
   turbine combustor operation using the University of Michigan Rapid
   Compression Facility. Pressure time history measurements and high-speed
   imaging of the ignition process in this facility were used to determine
   auto-ignition delay times and observe and characterize ignition
   behaviors. The simulated syngas mixtures were composed of H-2 and CO
   with a molar ratio of 0.7, for equivalence ratios (phi) of 0.1 and 0.5,
   near air dilution (i.e. molar O-2 to inert gas ratio of 1:3.76), with
   N-2 as the primary diluent gas. The pressures and temperatures after
   compression ranged from 3-15 atm and 870-1150 K respectively. The
   comprehensive results of the present work combined with those from
   previous shocktube studies in the literature clearly illustrate the
   existence of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous auto-ignition behaviors
   at these conditions. Analysis of patterns in the ignition behaviors
   revealed a dependence on temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio
   with distinct thermodynamic regions in which the ignition behavior is
   consistent and repeatable. Predicted locations of the strong ignition
   limit made using a criterion which compares laminar flame speed to a
   thermal gradient driven front propagation speed have excellent agreement
   with the experimental findings for each phi and an assumed gradient of 5
   K/mm. Experimental validation of this unique and powerful criterion
   means that it can be used for a priori prediction of the strong ignition
   limit using basic computational simulations. The validity of this
   criterion is fundamentally important, quantitatively describing the
   roles of chemical kinetics, thermo-physical properties, and device
   dependent thermal characteristics in determining auto-ignition behavior.
   Additionally, a comparison of the measured auto-ignition delay times to
   predictions made using zero-dimensional homogeneous reactor modeling
   revealed that agreement was dependent on phi, with excellent agreement
   for phi = 0.1 and large discrepancies for phi = 0.5. These results
   indicate that while inhomogeneous ignition phenomena are not entirely
   avoidable by reducing equivalence ratio, the subsequent effects on the
   accuracy of typical auto-ignition delay time predictions may be reduced
   or eliminated. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, a dynamic model of a vehicle with eight or more speed
   automatic transmission (A/T) has been developed for the analysis of
   shift quality and dynamic behavior of the vehicle during shift events.
   Subsystem models for engine, torque converter, automatic transmission,
   drivetrain, transmission control unit (TCU), and vehicle are developed
   and integrated with signal information interface. The subsystems
   included in the model were carefully selected to improve the accuracy of
   the model by comparing the simulation results with the test data. The
   systematic modeling approach based on matrix operation proposed in the
   study enables calibrating and fine-tuning the transmission control unit
   for shift quality in a virtual vehicle environment. The model presented
   in the study is validated with the vehicle test data and the comparison
   shows very good agreement. This paper presents a generalized modeling
   methodology for multiratio automatic transmissions that require both
   direct and indirect shifts. The model developed in the study provides a
   valuable analytical tool for the calibration and tuning of the
   transmission control unit by allowing quantitative analysis on the
   dynamic behavior and the performance metrics of an automatic

Abstract = {{This paper concerns in-plane vibration analysis of coupled bending and
   longitudinal vibrations in multi-story planar frame structures based on
   the advanced Timoshenko bending theory. It takes into account the
   effects of both rotary inertia and shear distortion. A wave based
   vibration analysis approach is proposed. From a wave vibration
   standpoint, vibrations propagate along a uniform waveguide (or
   structural element), and are reflected and transmitted at
   discontinuities (such as joints and boundaries). Reflection matrices at
   various boundaries, as well as transmission and reflection matrices at
   joint discontinuities are derived. Natural frequencies of coupled
   bending and longitudinal inplane vibrations are obtained by assembling
   these propagation, reflection, and transmission matrices. Numerical
   examples are presented along with comparisons to results available in
   literature. The examples show good agreement with the results presented

Abstract = {{Conventional explosives are relatively easy to obtain and may cause
   massive harm to people and property. There are several tools employed by
   law enforcement to detect explosives, but these can be subverted. Active
   neutron interrogation is a viable alternative to those techniques, and
   includes: fast neutron analysis, thermal neutron analysis, pulsed
   fast/thermal neutron analysis, neutron elastic scatter, and fast neutron
   radiography. These methods vary based on neutron energy and radiation
   detected. A thorough review of the principles behind, advantages, and
   disadvantages of the different types of active neutron interrogation is
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{NAND Flash memory has become the most widely used non-volatile memory
   technology. We focus on multi-level cell (MLC) NAND Flash memories
   because they have high storage density. Unfortunately MLC NAND Flash
   memory also has reliability problems due to narrower threshold voltage
   gap between logical states. Errors in these memories can be classified
   into data retention (DR) errors and program interference (PI) errors. DR
   errors are dominant if the data storage time is longer than 1 day and
   these errors can be reduced by refreshing the data. PI errors are
   dominant if the data storage time is less than 1 day and these errors
   can be handled by error control coding (ECC). In this paper we propose a
   combination of data refresh policies and low cost ECC schemes that are
   cognizant of application characteristics to address the errors in MLC
   NAND Flash memories. First, we use Gray code based encoding to reduce
   the error rates in the four subpages (MSB-even, LSB-even, MSB-odd,
   LSB-odd) of a 2-bit MLC NAND Flash memory. Next, we apply data refresh
   techniques where the refresh interval is a function of the program/erase
   (P/E) frequency of the application. We show that an appropriate choice
   of refresh interval and BCH based ECC scheme can minimize memory energy
   while satisfying the reliability constraint.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{3252-3264}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Macroscopic finite elements are elements with an embedded analytical
   solution that can capture detailed local fields, enabling more
   efficient, mesh independent finite element analysis. The shape functions
   are determined based on the analytical model rather than prescribed.
   This method was applied to adhesively bonded joints to model joint
   behavior with one element through the thickness. This study demonstrates
   two methods of maintaining the fidelity of such elements during adhesive
   non-linearity and cracking without increasing the mesh needed for an
   accurate solution. The first method uses adaptive shape functions, where
   the shape functions are recalculated at each load step based on the
   softening of the adhesive. The second method is internal mesh adaption,
   where cracking of the adhesive within an element is captured by further
   discretizing the element internally to represent the partially cracked
   geometry. By keeping mesh adaptations within an element, a finer mesh
   can be used during the, analysis without affecting the global finite
   element model mesh. Examples are shown which highlight when each method
   is most effective in reducing the number of elements needed to capture
   adhesive nonlinearity and cracking. These methods are validated against
   analogous finite element models utilizing cohesive zone elements. (C)

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Better washing machine designs and operation could reduce energy and
   water usage and extend cloth life. Washing machine studies have been
   traditionally empirical, since laundering typically involves complex
   motion of many cloth pieces in an inhomogeneous (fluid, cloth,
   detergent, agitator) setting. This paper presents a physics-based model
   of fully-submerged clothes washing in two- and three-dimensions.
   Multiple cloth pieces are modeled as thin elastic plates with tensile,
   shear, bending, and torsional stiffness, while the wash fluid is modeled
   with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid-cloth
   interaction is modeled via an immersed boundary method, and complex two-
   and three-dimensional agitator geometries are simulated with a Cartesian
   domain-mapping technique. The simulations have relatively coarse
   resolution that does not resolve all length scales for typical washing
   machine operating conditions. Hence, the converged results shown here
   are for moderate Reynolds numbers (Re). The simulation results include
   cloth stresses, torque on the wash basket, and the motion and
   deformation of the submerged cloth pieces. Specifically, the 3-D results
   show that the cloth stresses increase and the torque exerted on the
   outer wash basket decreases with increasing Re. The simulations examine
   how cloth motions differ with Reynolds number and cloth loading. The
   results reveal that for an agitator-driven 3-D wash geometry at higher
   Re, cloth pieces near the agitator at the bottom of the wash basket are
   first pushed by centrifugal force towards the outer stationary walls of
   the wash basket, then rise towards the top surface where they return to
   the axis of rotation and then sink towards the agitator. The variation
   of the center of mass positions of the cloth pieces are shown to
   increase for higher Re operating conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this work we present and compare deterministic and statistical
   algorithms for efficiently solving large-scale contaminant source
   inversion problems. The underlying equations of contaminant transport
   are assumed linear but unsteady and defined over complex geometries. The
   algorithms presented are accelerated through discrete adjoint solutions
   that are pre-computed efficiently in an offline stage, yielding savings
   in the time-critical online stage of several orders of magnitude in
   computational time. In the deterministic case, adjoints accelerate the
   application of the Hessian matrix, while in the statistical case,
   adjoints are used to directly evaluate samples. To address deterioration
   of statistical sampling efficiency for anisotropic posteriors, we
   present an application of a recently developed ensemble Markov chain
   Monte Carlo method. Results for two- and three-dimensional problems
   demonstrate the feasibility of statistical inversion for large-scale
   problems and show the advantage of statistical results over single-point

Abstract = {{Magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) are ferromagnetic particle
   impregnated rubbers whose mechanical properties are altered by the
   application of external magnetic fields. Due to their coupled
   magneto-mechanical response, MREs are finding an increasing number of
   engineering applications. One such application is in haptics, where the
   goal is to actively control surface roughness. One way to achieve this
   is by exploiting the unstable regime of MRE substrate/layer assemblies
   subjected to transverse magnetic fields. In this work, we study the
   response of such an assembly subjected to a transverse magnetic field
   and in-plane stress. The layer is made up of a transversely isotropic
   MRE material, whose energy density has been obtained experimentally,
   while the substrate is a non-magnetic isotropic pure polymer/gel. An
   analytical solution to this problem based on a general, finite strain,
   2D continuum modeling for both the MRE layer and the substrate shows
   that for adequately soft substrates there is a finite-wavelength
   buckling mode under a transverse magnetic field. Moreover, the critical
   magnetic field can be substantially reduced in the presence of a
   compressive stress of the assembly, thus opening the possibility for
   haptic applications operating under low magnetic fields. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The behavior of the precipitate in a Zr-1.6Sn-0.6Nb-0.2Fe-0.1Cr alloy
   under a 2 MeV proton irradiation was studied by transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). The plan-view TEM specimens were prepared by a focused
   ion beam (FIB) lift-out method. It is confirmed that the Zr(Fe, Cr,
   Nb)(2) precipitate with the hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure is
   the major secondary phase particle (SPP) in this zirconium alloy. At
   irradiation temperature of 360 degrees C, the Zr(Fe, Cr, Nb)(2)
   precipitate starts to be partially amorphized when the zirconium alloy
   was irradiated to 3.9 dpa, and was completely amorphized at 8.2 dpa. The
   mechanism for the Zr(Fe, Cr, Nb)(2) precipitate amorphization under
   proton irradiation is attributed to the Fe diffusion from the Zr(Fe, Cr,
   Nb)(2) phase to the zirconium alloy matrix. The current research
   indicates that the Zr-1.6Sn-0.6Nb-0.2Fe-0.1Cr alloy has lower
   irradiation resistance than that of Zircaloy-4, but the results still
   need to be further verified by its irradiation resistance with respect
   to neutron irradiation. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel method for determining the multiplication of a spent
   nuclear fuel assembly with a Differential Die-Away Self-Interrogation
   (DDSI) instrument. The signal, which is primarily created by thermal
   neutrons, is measured with four He-3 detector banks surrounding a spent
   fuel assembly. The Rossi-alpha distribution (RAD) at early times
   reflects coincident events from single fissions as well as fission
   chains. Because of this fact, the early time domain contains information
   about both the fissile material and spontaneous fission material in the
   assembly being measured. A single exponential function fit to the early
   time domain of the RAD has a die-away time proportional to the spent
   fuel assembly (SFA) multiplication. This correlation was tested by
   simulating assay of 44 different SFAs with the DDSI instrument. The SFA
   multiplication was determined with a variance of 0.7\%. (C) Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study probabilistically constrained problems involving
   individual chance constraints, random univariate right-hand sides, and
   risk tolerances defined as decision variables which affect part of the
   objective function. Built on the concept of efficient points, we
   formulate the problems as mixed-integer programs by using binary
   variables to determine an optimal risk tolerance for each chance
   constraint. We develop two benchmark approaches, both of which solve
   chance-constrained programs with fixed risk values in a bisection
   algorithm or by enumeration. We specify our approaches for a minimum
   cost flow problem and a network capacity design problem, both of which
   involve chance constraints for bounding the risk of demand shortages. We
   test instances with diverse size and complexity of the two network
   problems, and demonstrate the computational efficacy as well as give
   managerial insights. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Parametric reduced-order models of battery pack vibration including
   structural variation and prestress effects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{261}},
Pages = {{101-111}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to develop a numerical model for the vibration
   of hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) battery packs to enable probabilistic
   forced response simulations for the effects of variations. There are two
   important types of variations that affect their structural response
   significantly: the prestress that is applied when joining the cells
   within a pack; and the small, random structural property discrepancies
   among the cells of a battery pack. The main contributions of this work
   are summarized as follows. In order to account for these two important
   variations, a new parametric reduced order model (PROM) formulation is
   derived by employing three key observations: (1) the stiffness matrix
   can be parameterized for different levels of prestress, (2) the mode
   shapes of a battery pack with cell-to-cell variation can be represented
   as a linear combination of the mode shapes of the nominal system, and
   (3) the frame holding each cell has vibratory motion. A numerical
   example of an academic battery pack with pouch cells is presented to
   demonstrate that the PROM captures the effects of both prestress and
   structural variation on battery packs. The PROM is validated numerically
   by comparing full-order finite element models (FEMs) of the same
   systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   interfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Successful thermal management in nanostructured devices relies on
   control of interfacial thermal transport. Recent measurements have
   revealed poor thermal transport across interfaces between two dissimilar
   materials, e.g., organic semiconductors and metals. In such systems, the
   interfacial thermal conductance G(b) is dominated by the strength of
   interfacial bonding, but existing analytical models still fail to
   accurately predict G(b) especially for organic-metal interfaces. Growing
   interest in this research area calls for comprehensive understanding of
   interfacial thermal transport across hybrid material interfaces. Here we
   demonstrate that spatial nonuniformity has to be assessed in the
   calculation of G(b) for interfaces with partial coverage or
   incommensurate growth that is characteristic of these interfaces. The
   interface between copper phthalocyanine and fcc metals (Ag, Al, and Au)
   exhibits a sixfold difference between the metal's (similar to
   4-angstrom) and the organic molecule's (similar to 25-angstrom) lattice
   constant. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the spatial variation in
   G(b), and a model is developed that considers the spatial variations in
   phonon transmission, successfully predicting G(b) for many organic-metal
   interfaces.}},

   Nanosecond Pressure Pulse}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{We study the controlled generation of single microbubbles (approximately
   100 mu m) at solid surfaces in water. By focusing a nanosecond pressure
   pulse (<100 ns), the single microbubble is deterministically generated
   over the focal area, which is rather immune to surface heterogeneity
   that is typically responsible for uncontrolled bubble nucleation. Such
   controlled bubble nucleation is realized by strong negative pressure
   generated by pulsed optical excitation of a carbon-nanotube-polymer
   composite and its tight focusing (approximately 100 mu m). The
   negative-pressure amplitude (>50 MPa), which is further increased by
   acoustic interference at an impedance-mismatched boundary, even exceeds
   the cavitation threshold of distilled water in a free-field
   (boundary-free) condition. This strong pressure can activate ubiquitous
   submicron nuclei in both water and surfaces, making the nucleation
   process controllable but irrelevant to a pit array (<10 mu m in
   diameter). The ability to control bubble formation can lead to new
   applications in cell-level therapy, e. g., ablation of individual

Abstract = {{A technique for analyzing the effect of the geometrical shape of a
   source or a detector, using a quadrupole expansion, is described herein.
   It is shown that this method may be exploited to predict, optimize the
   geometry of a source, or a measurement device, and nearly eliminate, the
   departure from the 1/r(2) fall-off characteristic due to irradiation
   from small sources. We have investigated several simple shapes that have
   a vanishing Q(2) quadrupole moment: a right circular cylinder with a
   diameter to depth ratio of root 2, a cone with a radius to height ratio
   of unity, and an oblate ellipsoid with a diameter to depth ratio of root
   3/2. These ideal shapes produce optimally small departures in a 1/r(2)
   field, nearly mimicking a point-like detector. We have also found a
   rotationally symmetric shape, intermediate to the other three, that has
   additionally, a vanishing Q(4), the hexadecapole moment. This geometry
   further improves the 1/r(2)-perturbation characteristics and has an
   additional free parameter that may be adjusted to model the ideal
   cylinder, cone or oblate spheroid.}},

Title = {{Additional Constructions to Solve the Generalized Russian Cards Problem
   using Combinatorial Designs}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF COMBINATORICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{In the generalized Russian cards problem, we have a card deck X of n
   cards and three participants, Alice, Bob, and Cathy, dealt a, b, and c
   cards, respectively. Once the cards are dealt, Alice and Bob wish to
   privately communicate their hands to each other via public
   announcements, without the advantage of a shared secret or public key
   infrastructure. Cathy, for her part, should remain ignorant of all but
   her own cards after Alice and Bob have made their announcements. Notions
   for Cathy's ignorance in the literature range from Cathy not learning
   the fate of any individual card with certainty (weak 1-security) to not
   gaining any probabilistic advantage in guessing the fate of some set of
   delta cards (perfect delta-security). As we demonstrate in this work,
   the generalized Russian cards problem has close ties to the field of
   combinatorial designs, on which we rely heavily, particularly for
   perfect security notions. Our main result establishes an equivalence
   between perfectly delta-secure strategies and (c + delta)-designs on n
   points with block size a, when announcements are chosen uniformly at
   random from the set of possible announcements. We also provide
   construction methods and example solutions, including a construction
   that yields perfect 1-security against Cathy when c = 2. Drawing on our
   equivalence results, we are able to use a known combinatorial design to
   construct a strategy with a = 8, b = 13, and c = 3 that is perfectly
   2-secure. Finally, we consider a variant of the problem that yields
   solutions that are easy to construct and optimal with respect to both
   the number of announcements and level of security achieved. Moreover,
   this is the first method obtaining weak delta-security that allows Alice
   to hold an arbitrary number of cards and Cathy to hold a set of c =
   {[}a-delta/2] cards. Alternatively, the construction yields solutions
   for arbitrary delta, c and any a >= delta + 2c.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer-stromal cell interactions are a critical process in
   tumorigenesis. Conventional dish-based assays, which simply mix two cell
   types, have limitations in three aspects: 1) limited control of the cell
   micro-environment; 2) inability to study cell behavior in a single-cell
   manner; and 3) have difficulties in characterizing single cell behavior
   within a highly heterogeneous cell population (e.g. tumor). An
   innovative use of microfluidic technology is for improving the spatial
   resolution for single cell assays. However, it is challenging to isolate
   the paired interacting cells while maintaining nutrient renewal. In this
   work, two-phase flow was used as a simple isolation method, separating
   the microenvironment of each individual chamber. As nutrients in an
   isolated chamber are consumed by cells, media exchange is required. To
   connect the cell culture chamber to the media exchange layer, we
   demonstrated a 3D microsystem integration technique using vertical
   connections fabricated by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE). Compared to
   previous approaches, the presented process allows area reduction of
   vertical connections by an order of magnitude, enabling compact 3D
   integration. A semi-permeable membrane was sandwiched between the cell
   culture layer and the media exchange layer. The selectivity of the
   semi-permeable membrane results in the retention of the signaling
   proteins within the chamber while allowing free diffusion of nutrients
   (e.g., glucose and amino acids). Thus, paracrine signals are accumulated
   inside the chamber without cross-talk between cells in other chambers.
   Utilizing these innovations, we co-cultured UM-SCC-1 (head and neck
   squamous cell carcinoma) cells and endothelial cells to simulate tumor
   proliferation enhancement in the vascular endothelial niche.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{188-197}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Ferroelastic domains are common defects in epitaxial ferroelectric thin
   films, being typically observed around interfacial dislocations due to
   attractive elastic interactions. Because of their large stress fields,
   domain size and shape can influence local ferroelectric switching
   behavior. Here the morphology of ferroelastic domains in Pb(Zr-0.2,
   Ti-0.8)O-3 thin films is investigated as a function of film thickness
   and substrate strain using phase field modeling in combination with
   transmission electron microscopy. Increasing film thickness or strain is
   found to induce switching from typical ferroelastic domains extending to
   the free surface of the film to nanosized domains localized near the
   substrate interface. An analysis of thermodynamic properties reveals
   hysteretic and discontinuous changes in the first derivatives of the
   free energy resulting from competing electrostatic and elastic energies.
   Such first-order morphological transitions are expected to be very
   common in epitaxial thin films during switching under an external
   electric or stress field. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Title = {{Compositional evolution of Q-phase precipitates in an aluminum alloy}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{322-336}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Lightweight, age-hardenable aluminum alloys are attracting increasing
   attention as a means to reduce vehicle mass and improve fuel economy. To
   accelerate the adoption of these alloys, knowledge of the complex
   precipitation processes that underlie their primary strengthening
   mechanism is essential. Here we employ a combination of atom-probe
   tomography (APT), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), transmission
   electron-microscopy, X-ray diffraction and first-principles calculations
   to reveal the compositional evolution of Q-phase precipitates in a
   commercial, age-hardenable aluminum alloy, W319. Three different aging
   conditions are investigated: 438 K/8 h, 463 K/8 h and 533 K/4 h.
   Co-precipitation of theta'- and Q-phase precipitates is observed for all
   aging conditions, which, when combined with DSC analysis of the
   precipitation sequence, suggests that Q-phase precipitates serve as
   heterogeneous nucleation sites for theta'-platelets. Regarding
   composition evolution, aging at the lower temperatures yields Q-phase
   precipitates that are Cu-rich, yet deficient in Mg and Si:
   44Al-22Cu-16Mg-16.5Si at.\%. The composition evolves to become Mg-rich
   after aging at 533 K: similar to 28Al-9Cu-37Mg-26Si at.\%. APT provides
   evidence for partitioning of Zn to the Q-phase precipitates. The
   energetics of Zn partitioning was evaluated using first-principles
   calculations, and suggests that this partitioning is a kinetic effect.
   Our analyses provide new insights into the complex precipitation
   processes in commercial Al alloys, and should foster the enhancement of
   alloy performance through optimization of aging conditions. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Sparse coding encodes natural stimuli using a small number of basis
   functions known as receptive fields. In this work, we design custom
   hardware architectures for efficient and high-performance
   implementations of a sparse coding algorithm called the sparse and
   independent local network (SAILnet). A study of the neuron spiking
   dynamics uncovers important design considerations involving the neural
   network size, target firing rate, and neuron update step size. Optimal
   tuning of these parameters keeps the neuron spikes sparse and random to
   achieve the best image fidelity. We investigate practical hardware
   architectures for SAILnet: a bus architecture that provides efficient
   neuron communications, but results in spike collisions; and a ring
   architecture that is more scalable, but causes neuron misfires. We show
   that the spike collision rate is reduced with a sparse spiking neural
   network, so an arbitration-free bus architecture can be designed to
   tolerate collisions without the need of arbitration. To reduce neuron
   misfires, we design a latent ring architecture to damp the neuron
   responses for an improved image fidelity. The bus and the ring
   architecture can be combined in a hybrid architecture to achieve both
   high throughput and scalability. The three architectures are synthesized
   and place-and-routed in a 65 nm CMOS technology. The proof-of-concept
   designs demonstrate a high sparse coding throughput up to 952 M pixels
   per second at an energy consumption of 0.486 nJ per pixel.}},

Abstract = {{We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first complete
   three-dimensional numerical solutions to a broad range of boundary value
   problems for a general theory of finite strain gradient elasticity. We
   have chosen for our work, Toupin's theory (Toupin, 1962) one of the more
   general formulations of strain gradient elasticity. Our framework has
   three crucial ingredients: The first is isogeometric analysis (Hughes et
   al., 2005), which we have adopted for its straightforward and robust
   representation of C-1-continuity. The second is a weak treatment of the
   higher-order Dirichlet boundary conditions in the formulation, which
   control the development of strain gradients in the solution. The third
   ingredient is algorithmic (automatic) differentiation, which eliminates
   the need for linearization ``by hand{''} of the rather complicated
   geometric and material nonlinearities in gradient elasticity at finite
   strains. We present a number of numerical solutions to demonstrate that
   the framework is applicable to arbitrary boundary value problems in
   three dimensions. We discuss length scale effects, the role of
   higher-order boundary conditions, and perhaps most importantly, the
   relevance of the framework to problems with elastic free energy density
   functions that are non-convex in strain space. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Evaluating UV/H2O2 Exposure as a DEHP Degradation Treatment for
   Plasticized PVC}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{131}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Millions of tons of plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) materials are
   disposed every year. A biologically sustainable and green method for
   removal of toxic plasticizers from polymer systems after disposal is
   highly desired since plasticizers can leach out into the environment
   over decades. Here we compare the surface and bulk structural changes of
   DEHP-plasticized PVC after two treatments intended to degrade
   bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in PVC plastic: short wave (254 nm) UV
   with and without the addition of 35 wt \% H2O2. Sum frequency generation
   vibrational spectroscopy (SFG) reveals the addition of aqueous H2O2
   decreases CH3 signals on the surface of the films up to 8 h, due to
   increased molecular disorder and the removal of alkyl chains. Secondary
   ion mass spectrometry demonstrates that the degradation of DEHP after 8
   h of reaction is similar with and without the use of H2O2. However, FTIR
   results reveal that the introduction of H2O2 reduces bulk DEHP
   degradation and leads to competing radical chain scission reactions with
   PVC. Therefore, simple short wave UV exposure may be an effective means
   to degrade DEHP within and on PVC plastic and the addition of H2O2 is
   only beneficial if additional degradation of PVC is needed. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{A combined approach of scanning electron microscopy and digital image
   correlation was used to examine microstructure-scale strain localization
   and active deformation mechanisms in ultrafine-grained (UFG) high purity
   (99.99\%) aluminum processed by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP).
   The results from tensile tests demonstrate a strong relationship between
   the heterogeneous microstructure and strain localization. The localized
   deformation was investigated in areas that contain significantly
   different microstructural features typical of ECAP processed aluminum.
   It was found that areas of the UFG microstructure containing primarily
   low angle grain boundaries deformed by dislocation slip and behaved
   similarly to a coarse-grained material. The greatest strain localization
   occurred at high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) separating distinct
   microstructure regions and with median surface trace angles of
   approximately 26.6 degrees. In areas of banded microstructure, shear
   strain localization as high as 30\% and shear displacements of up to 500
   nm occurred at the HAGBs separating bands, suggesting grain boundary
   sliding.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to manipulate the electronic structure of the
   low-dimensional magnetic semiconductor MnSb2Se4 via isomorphic Sn/Sb
   substitutions enables independent investigation of the interactions of
   free carriers with localized magnetic moments and their effects on the
   predominant magnetic ordering in the p-type MnSb2-xSnxSe4 (0 <= x <=
   0.25) semiconductors. We find a large increase in the electrical
   resistivity and thermopower with increasing Sn content suggesting a
   surprising decrease in the overall hole density. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy reveals that Sn atoms enter the structure in the 2+
   oxidation state, whereas a fraction of the remaining Sb3+ partially
   oxidizes to Sb5+ to maintain the electroneutrality of the compound.
   Therefore, we attribute the drop in the hole density to electron-hole
   compensation processes. Interestingly, magnetic susceptibility data
   reveal a remarkable switching of the dominant magnetic interaction from
   antiferromagnetism (AFM) (x = 0) to ferromagnetism (FM) with T-c similar
   to 56 K for 0.05 <= x <= 0.15 samples and a reversal to AFM ordering for
   x > 0.15. The Sn-dependent FM interaction in MnSb2-xSnxSe4 is
   rationalized within the context of the formation of overlapping bound
   magnetic polarons (BMPs) through the interactions between the added
   electrons/holes and localized moments of Mn2+ magnetic ions.}},

Title = {{Adhesive bonding of fire-resistive engineered cementitious composites
   (ECC) to steel}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{431-439}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of developing a
   fire-resistive engineered cementitious composite (FR-ECC) to address the
   current issue of lack of durability (adhesion and cohesion) of
   spray-applied fire-resistive materials (SFRM) on steel structures.
   FR-ECC was shown to possess inherently better cohesive properties over
   conventional SFRM, facilitated by its relatively high tensile strength
   and ductility. This paper aims at tailoring the FR-ECC for enhanced
   adhesion and characterizing its adhesive property to steel substrate.
   Specifically, an acrylic latex bonding agent was used as admixture in
   FR-ECC and as an interfacial adhesive, and a fracture mechanics based
   adhesion test method was adopted to quantify the change in adhesive
   property. Based on the measured adhesion between latex modified FR-ECC
   matrix and steel, using latex as admixture and interfacial adhesives
   effectively improved the interfacial adhesive energy of FR-ECC matrix by
   54\% and 147\%, respectively, compared to unmodified one. Environmental
   scanning electron microscopy revealed changes in composition and
   microstructure of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between latex
   modified FR-ECC matrix and steel, which resulted in the higher adhesive
   bond. The effect of latex addition on the mechanical performance of
   FR-ECC was also studied and discussed in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A uniform carbon layer was coated on Si nanoparticles by the dynamic
   chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process with toluene as the carbon
   source. The carbon layer thickness could easily be adjusted by
   controlling the preparation conditions. Samples selected from different
   positions of the reaction tube showed a small deviation in carbon
   content. As an anode material for a lithium-ion battery, the resulting
   Si@C composites exhibited better cycle reversibility and rate capability
   than pristine Si. The Si@C-2 sample (carbon layer thickness approximate
   to 12 nm) delivered a relatively stable specific capacity of ca. 1600 mA
   h g(-1) at 0.3 A g(-1) for 70 cycles. Its capacity remained at 750 mA h
   g(-1) at 5 A g(-1), compared with 240 mA h g(-1) for pristine Si.
   Acetylene as a carbon source can also lead to superior cycle stability.
   This reformative CVD process provides an avenue for the large-scale
   production of uniform carbon coating materials used for batteries and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a nonlinear numerical study of the
   electrohydrodynamic (EHD) patterning process as a micro/nanostructuring
   approach for a thin polymer film. Special interest is focused on the
   steady state (or equilibrium state) in this study. Numerical results
   show that the polymer nanostructure height depends strongly on the
   applied voltage, rising higher with an increasing electric field.
   Moreover, a critical electric field intensity is discovered, above which
   the deformed film can grow continuously into a final contact with the
   template to form a nanostructure conformal the pattern premade on the
   template. An electric field intensity larger than the critical value is
   necessary for a faithful replica in EHD patterning; however, breakdown
   may occur for polymer film under a strong electric field and thus fail
   the process. In this study, the scale limitation is investigated and
   some methods are then proposed for scaling down the feature size of the
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Elucidating the role of interparticle Li transport and multi-particle
   (de)lithiation kinetics in nanoparticulate two-phase electrode materials
   such as LiFePO4 is a challenging task because of the small temporal and
   spatial scale associated with the process. Often, the relevant processes
   that determine the,kinetics of (dis)charging an electrode are assumed to
   be exclusively those associated with Li transport to and from the
   counter-electrode, without a consideration of interactions between
   particles. However, the redistribution of Li between nanoparticles can
   have a strong influence on the overall cell rate performance. Using a
   continuum model to simulate the lithiation kinetics of a porous
   aggregate of LiFePO4 nanoparticles, we demonstrate the impact of cell
   architecture (in terms of ionic and electronic connectivities between
   active particles) and cycling rate on the multi-particle (de)lithiation
   kinetics. Specifically, the connectivity between particles is shown to
   have a strong effect on ``interparticle phase separation,{''} a process
   by which active particles undergo additional cycling (charge during the
   overall discharge) and amplified reaction rates. We show that
   interparticle phase separation can be reduced or eliminated by improving
   ({''}homogenizing{''}) the connectivity between particles. Extensive
   comparisons to experimental literature and insights toward improving the
   performance of nanoparticulate electrodes are also provided. (C) 2014

   studies reveal a negative dependence of mu on the electric field E, with
   a strength quantified by the parameter beta. The largest magnitude of

   dependence of mu on the electric field E; beta decreased monotonically

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{We study the temperature dependence of the triplet and singlet exciton
   dynamics in the archetype small molecule fluorescent guest-host system
   tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato) aluminum (Alq3) doped with
   4-(dicyanomethylene)-2methyl- 6-julolidyl-9-enyl-4H-pyran (DCM2). We
   develop a comprehensive model of the exciton dynamics, and use it to fit
   the transient photoluminescence under different pulsed optical pumping
   in the temperature range of 80 < T < 295 K. The triplet decay has a
   significantly different temperature dependence than that of singlets.
   From 295 to 80 K, the triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) rate decreases
   by two orders of magnitude, whereas the singlet-triplet annihilation
   rate decreases by < 50\%, primarily a result of the different energy
   transfer mechanisms of singlets and triplets. The temperature dependence
   of the TTA rate reveals two regimes separated by a transition at 180 K
   from Marcus to Miller-Abrahams transfer. This work deepens our
   understanding of exciton dynamics and energy transfer in small molecule
   organic materials.}},

Title = {{Effects of local pH on the formation and regulation of cristae
   morphologies}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Cristae, folded subcompartments of the inner mitochondrial membrane
   (IMM), have complex and dynamic morphologies. Since cristae are the
   major site of adenosine triphosphate synthesis, morphological changes of
   cristae have been studied in relation to functional states of
   mitochondria. In this sense, investigating the functional and structural
   significance of cristae may be critical for understanding progressive
   mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the detailed mechanisms of the
   formation and regulation of these cristae structures have not been fully
   elucidated. Among the hypotheses concerning the regulation of cristae
   morphologies, we exclusively investigate the effects of the local pH
   gradient on the cristae morphologies by using a numerical model. An
   area-difference induced curvature of the membrane is modeled as a
   function of local pH. This curvature is then applied to the finite
   element model of a closed lipid bilayer in order to find the
   energetically favorable membrane configuration. From this study, we
   substantiate the hypothesis that a tubular crista structure can be
   formed and regulated by the local pH gradient. Through the simulations
   with various initial conditions, we further demonstrate that the
   diameter of a crista is mainly determined by the local pH gradient, and
   the energetically favorable direction of crista growth is perpendicular
   to the longitudinal axis of a mitochondrion. Finally, the simulation
   results at the mitochondrial scale suggest that the cristae membrane may
   have a lower local pH value and/or a higher cardiolipin composition than
   the other parts of the IMM.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological stability of nanosilica-filled polyamide 6/polystyrene
   (PA6/PS) blends under flow was evaluated via online optical-shear
   technique and rheology methods. In the presence of nanosilica, the
   droplet size of as-prepared blends was refined at low hydrophilic
   nanosilica concentrations (1-3 vol.\%). When a slow shear flow was
   imposed, the morphology of hydrophilic nanosilica-filled blends became
   unstable and displayed a promoted coalescence dynamics. These droplets
   broke up at high shear rates but the breakup dynamics was suppressed at
   high nanosilica concentrations. The flow-induced morphological
   discrepancies at different shear rates for the hydrophilic
   nanosilica-filled blends were discussed in terms of the significantly
   enhanced viscoelasticity of the droplets and the decreased interfacial
   tension of the blends induced by nanosilica. Correlation between the
   transient rheology and morphological evolution of these filled blends
   was also examined. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   (SubPc/C-60) donor/acceptor heterojunction embedded within a planar
   semitransparent metallic nanocavity. The absorption and EQE are modeled
   in detail and probed by attenuated total internal reflection
   spectroscopy with excellent agreement. At SPR, the EQE can be enhanced
   fourfold relative to normal incidence, due to simulated ninefold
   enhancement in active layer absorption efficiency. The response at SPR
   is thickness-independent, down to a few monolayers, suggesting the
   ability to excite monolayer-scale junctions with an EQE of approximate
   to 6\% and a 16-fold absorption enhancement over normal incidence. These
   results potentially impact the future design of plasmonically enhanced
   thin-film photovoltaics and photodetectors and enable the direct
   analysis of the dynamics of photocurrent production at OPV
   heterojunctions.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{The exceptional sensitivity of mammalian hearing organs is attributed to
   an active process, where force produced by sensory cells boost
   sound-induced vibrations, making soft sounds audible. This process is
   thought to be local, with each section of the hearing organ capable of
   amplifying sound-evoked movement, and nearly instantaneous, since
   amplification can work for sounds at frequencies up to 100 kHz in some
   species. To test these fundamental precepts, we developed a method for
   focally stimulating the living hearing organ with light. Light pulses
   caused intense and highly damped mechanical responses followed by
   traveling waves that developed with considerable delay. The delayed
   response was identical to movements evoked by click-like sounds. This
   shows that the active process is neither local nor instantaneous, but
   requires mechanical waves traveling from the cochlear base toward its
   apex. A physiologically-based mathematical model shows that such waves
   engage the active process, enhancing hearing sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper theoretically and experimentally investigates frequency-tuned

   adjusted to compensate for changes in mutual inductance that occur for
   variations of transmitter and receiver loop positions. Frequency-tuning
   is employed for a range of distances over which the loops are strongly
   coupled. In contrast, the impedance-tuned system employs varactor-based
   matching networks to compensate for changes in mutual inductance, and to
   achieve a simultaneous conjugate impedance match over a range of
   distances. The frequency-tuned system is simpler to implement, while the
   impedance-tuned system is more complex, but can achieve higher
   efficiencies. Both of the experimental wireless non-radiative

Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{983-998}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a modeling framework based on finite-state space
   Markov chains (MCs) and fuzzy subsets to represent signals that vary in
   a continuous range. Our special attention to this extension of
   finite-state space MC modeling is motivated by numerous opportunities in
   applying MC models to represent physical variables in automotive and
   aerospace systems and, subsequently, using these models for fault
   detection, estimation, prediction, stochastic dynamic programming, and
   stochastic model predictive control. Our generalized MC modeling
   framework synergistically combines the notion of transition
   probabilities with information granulation based on fuzzy partitioning.
   As compared with the case of more familiar interval partitioning, the
   transition probabilities in our model are defined for transitions
   between fuzzy subsets rather than intervals/rectangular cells. Our
   framework is first introduced for scalar-valued signals and then
   extended to vector-valued signals. A real-time capable recursive
   algorithm for learning transition probabilities from measured signal
   data is derived. Formulas that characterize the possibility distribution
   of the next signal value and predict the next signal value are given. It
   is shown that the introduced modeling framework based on MC models
   defined over fuzzy partitioning inherits all properties and represents a
   natural extension of MC models defined over interval partitioning, while
   providing interpolation ability and improved prediction accuracy. In
   addition, we derive an alternative formulation of the Chapman-Kolmogorov
   equation that applies to models in possibilistic/fuzzy environment.
   Examples are given to illustrate the key notions and results based on
   modeling of the vehicle speed and road grade signals.}},

   Opportunistic Channel Access: A Unifying Framework}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a widely studied stochastic control problem arising
   from opportunistic spectrum access in a multichannel system, with the
   goal of providing a unifying analytical framework whereby a number of
   prior results may be viewed as special cases. Specifically, we consider
   a single wireless transceiver/user with access to N channels, each
   modeled as an independent identically distributed discrete-time
   two-state Markov chain. In each time step, the user is allowed to sense
   k <= N channels, and subsequently use up to m <= k channels out of those
   sensed to be available. Channel sensing is assumed to be perfect, and
   for each channel used in each time step the user gets a unit reward. The
   user's objective is to maximize its total discounted or average reward
   over a finite or infinite horizon. This problem has previously been
   studied in various special cases including k = 1 and m = k <= N, often
   cast as a restless bandit problem, with optimality results derived for a
   myopic policy that seeks to maximize the immediate one-step reward when
   the two-state Markov chain model is positively correlated. In this
   paper, we study the general problem with 1 <= m <= k <= N, and derive
   sufficient conditions under which the myopic policy is optimal for the
   finite and infinite horizon reward criteria, respectively. It is shown
   that these results reduce to those derived in prior studies under the
   corresponding special cases, and thus may be viewed as a set of unifying
   optimality conditions. Numerical examples are also presented to
   highlight how and why an optimal policy may deviate from the
   otherwise-optimal myopic sensing given additional exploration
   opportunities, i.e., when m < k.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on an exact, real-time solution for server-client
   cooperative localization over a faulty and extremely bandwidth-limited
   underwater communication channel. Our algorithm, termed the origin state
   method, enables a `server' vehicle to broadcast its navigation
   information to multiple `client' vehicles over a bandwidth-limited and
   faulty communication channel. The server's broadcasted pose-graph can be
   used in conjunction with an estimator on the client to exactly reproduce
   the corresponding server-client centralized estimate. We present an
   evaluation over an extensive real-time field implementation of the
   proposed algorithm for a multi-agent autonomous underwater vehicle
   network using underwater acoustic modems to communicate in a
   synchronous-clock transmission framework.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the robustness of a seismically designed steel
   moment frame building using 3-D nonlinear models. Computational
   simulations are carried out using validated models to investigate
   building response to loss of internal and external columns as well as
   columns in lower, middle and upper floors. Studies are conducted to gain
   insight into the sources of collapse resistance of the prototype
   building, focusing in particular on the role of composite action between
   the slab and underlying steel beams and slab membrane action. The
   simulation results suggest that the prototype building can be more
   vulnerable to loss of columns in the upper stories than in the lower
   ones and is particularly vulnerable to loss of interior gravity columns
   at all floor levels. The role of the slab is quantified and it is shown
   that it can contribute significantly to the robustness of the structure,
   but it is a double edge sword that can also be detrimental, especially
   in the final stages of collapse. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Title = {{Skin-friction drag reduction in the turbulent regime using
   random-textured hydrophobic surfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Technologies for reducing hydrodynamic skin-friction drag have a huge
   potential for energy-savings in applications ranging from propulsion of
   marine vessels to transporting liquids through pipes. The majority of
   previous experimental studies using hydrophobic surfaces have
   successfully shown skin-friction drag reduction in the laminar and
   transitional flow regimes (typically Reynolds numbers less than similar
   or equal to 10(6) for external flows). However, this hydrophobicity
   induced drag reduction is known to diminish with increasing Reynolds
   numbers in experiments involving wall bounded turbulent flows. Using
   random-textured hydrophobic surfaces (fabricated using large-length
   scalable thermal spray processes) on a flat plate geometry, we present
   water-tunnel test data with Reynolds numbers ranging from 10(6) to 9 x
   10(6) that show sustained skin-friction drag reduction of 20\%-30\% in
   such turbulent flow regimes. Furthermore, we provide evidence that apart
   from the formation of a Cassie state and hydrophobicity, we also need a
   low surface roughness and an enhanced ability of the textured surface to
   retain trapped air, for sustained drag reduction in turbulent flow
   regimes. Specifically, for the hydrophobic test surfaces of the present
   and previous studies, we show that drag reduction seen at lower Reynolds
   numbers diminishes with increasing Reynolds number when the surface
   roughness of the underlying texture becomes comparable to the viscous
   sublayer thickness. Conversely, test data show that textures with
   surface roughness significantly smaller than the viscous sublayer
   thickness and textures with high porosity show sustained drag reduction
   in the turbulent flow regime. The present experiments represent a
   significant technological advancement and one of the very few
   demonstrations of skin-friction reduction in the turbulent regime using
   random-textured hydrophobic surfaces in an external flow configuration.
   The scalability of the fabrication method, the passive nature of this
   surface technology, and the obtained results in the turbulent regime
   make such hydrophobic surfaces a potentially attractive option for
   hydrodynamic skin-friction drag reduction. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{183-191}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{An experimental facility has been designed to study the transverse
   response of the vortex-induced vibration of a fully submerged horizontal
   cylinder under the influence of vertical harmonic oscillating motion.
   The study aims to analyze the vortex self-induced vibration (VSIV)
   phenomenon which occurs on steel catenary risers (SCR) connected to
   floating platforms in the deep offshore. These vibrations occur in the
   absence of a current due to the self-motion of the body caused by a
   source afar. The experiments were conducted in a tank at the
   LOC/COPPE/UFRJ (Laboratory of Waves and Current of COPPE, Federal
   University of Rio de Janeiro). The amplitude and frequency of transverse
   motion are calculated for various Keulegan-Carpenter numbers and reduced
   velocities. Thanks to both the use of recent instrumentation and very
   low damping pneumatic bearing, the paper complements the pioneering work
   by Sumer and Fredsoe (1988) by exhibiting for the first time the
   trajectories of the VSIV motion. These are classified based on their
   different configurations such as oval-shape, eight-shape, etc. The
   Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) tests are used to study the behavior of
   the flow around the cylinder during different trajectories of VSIV
   motion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   twin bodies in a two-layer fluid}},
Journal = {{APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{204-218}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We study the moonpool resonances of two interface and surface-piercing
   rectangular bodies in a two-layer fluid due to forced harmonic heave
   motion. The problem is solved by employing a domain decomposition scheme
   with an eigenfunction matching approach. Heave added mass and damping
   coefficients, as well as inner and outer region (far-field) radiated
   wave elevations, are computed to examine the hydrodynamic behavior of
   the twin floating bodies. The numerical solutions have been compared
   with those for the case investigated by Zhang and Bandyk {[}1] where the
   floating bodies remain in the upper layer fluid. The present analyses
   reveal that there exist both Helmholtz and higher-order, also called
   sloshing mode, resonances in the two-layer fluid. It is found that, for
   an interface and surface piercing twin bodies, the higher-order
   resonances are closely related with both the free surface and internal
   waves inside the moonpool gap. Moreover, it is also found that low
   frequency forced motion can excite higher-order resonances through
   forming standing internal waves inside the moonpool. Parametric studies
   have been performed to identify the dependence of hydrodynamic behavior
   and resonant characteristics on geometry and density stratification. (C)

Abstract = {{Deeply scaled CMOS circuits are increasingly susceptible to transient
   faults and soft errors; emerging post-CMOS devices can be more
   vulnerable, sometimes exhibiting erratic errors of arbitrary duration.
   Applying timing and supply voltage margin is wasteful and becoming
   ineffective, and conventional checking and sparing techniques provide
   only a limited error coverage against widely varying errors. We propose
   a confidence-driven computing (CDC) model for an adaptive protection
   against nondeterministic errors. The CDC model employs fine-grained
   temporal redundancy and confidence checking for a faster adaptation and
   tunable reliability. The CDC model can be extended to deeply scaled CMOS
   circuits that are mainly affected by transient faults and soft errors,
   where an early checking (EC) technique can be used to perform
   independent error checking for more flexibility and better performance.
   To evaluate the CDC model, we apply a sample-based field-programmable
   gate array emulation along with real-time error injection. The CDC model
   is shown to adapt to fluctuating error rates and enhance the system
   reliability by effectively trading off performance. To evaluate the EC
   technique at a finer time scale, we create a new event-based simulation
   to capture path delay distribution, error model, and their interactions.
   The EC technique improves the system reliability by more than four
   orders of magnitude when errors are of short duration. Both the CDC
   model and the EC technique are synthesized in a 45-nm CMOS technology
   for cost estimates: 1) the area overhead is as low as 12\% and 2) energy
   overhead can be limited to 19\%.}},

   patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG).
   Design: Secondary analyses using longitudinal data from 2 randomized
   controlled trials.
   Participants: A total of 571 participants from the Advanced Glaucoma
   Intervention Study (AGIS) and the Collaborative Initial Glaucoma
   Treatment Study (CIGTS).
   Methods: Perimetric and tonometric data were obtained for AGIS and CIGTS
   trial participants and used to parameterize and validate a Kalman filter
   model. The Kalman filter updates knowledge about each participant's
   disease dynamics as additional VF tests and IOP measurements are
   obtained. After incorporating the most recent VF and IOP measurements,
   the model forecasts each participant's disease dynamics into the future
   and characterizes the forecasting error. To determine personalized
   schedules for future VF tests and IOP measurements, we developed an
   algorithm by combining the Kalman filter for state estimation with the
   predictive power of logistic regression to identify OAG progression. The
   algorithm was compared with 1-, 1.5-, and 2-year fixed interval
   schedules of obtaining VF and IOP measurements.
   Main Outcome Measures: Length of diagnostic delay in detecting OAG
   progression, efficiency of detecting progression, and number of VF and
   IOP measurements needed to assess for progression.
   Results: Participants were followed in the AGIS and CIGTS trials for a
   mean (standard deviation) of 6.5 (2.8) years. Our forecasting model
   achieved a 29\% increased efficiency in identifying OAG progression
   (P<0.0001) and detected OAG progression 57\% sooner (reduced diagnostic
   delay) (P = 0.02) than following a fixed yearly monitoring schedule,
   without increasing the number of VF tests and IOP measurements required.
   The model performed well for patients with mild and advanced disease.
   The model performed significantly more testing of patients who exhibited
   OAG progression than nonprogressing patients (1.3 vs. 1.0 tests per
   year; P<0.0001).
   Conclusions: Use of dynamic and personalized testing schedules can
   enhance the efficiency of OAG progression detection and reduce
   diagnostic delay compared with yearly fixed monitoring intervals. If
   further validation studies confirm these findings, such algorithms may
   be able to greatly enhance OAG management. (C) 2014 by the American

Abstract = {{Recent advances in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) open new doors
   for therapeutics of motor neuron (MN)-associated neurodegenerative
   diseases. However, the MN differentiation process is not yet completely
   understood. In this Viewpoint, we stress the concept of designing
   synthetic cell culture surfaces with precisely controlled mechanical
   properties (such as rigidity) to improve the efficiency of MN
   differentiation from hPSCs. Emerging evidence strongly supports the
   potent role of mechanobiology in controlling stem cell fate. Leveraging
   the intrinsic mechanosensitive properties of hPSCs in conjunction with a
   synthetic elastomeric micropost array system, we have recently
   demonstrated significantly improved MN differentiation from hPSCs.
   Mechanotransduction mechanisms of hPSCs are an unexplored territory and
   likely involve coordination and cross-regulations of multiple targets
   and pathways including cell surface receptors, signaling transduction
   molecules, and nuclear proteins. We envision that research in hPSCs for
   MN degenerative diseases will benefit from accumulating knowledge of
   mechanobiology of hPSCs.}},

Abstract = {{Size reduction of neural electrodes is essential for improving the
   functionality of neuroprosthetic devices, developing potent therapies
   for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, and long-term brain
   computer interfaces. Typical neural electrodes are micromanufactured
   devices with dimensions ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers.
   Their further miniaturization is necessary to reduce local tissue damage
   and chronic immunological reactions of the brain. Here we report the
   neural electrode with subcellular dimensions based on single-crystalline
   gold nanowires (NWs) with a diameter of similar to 100 nm. Unique
   mechanical and electrical properties of defect-free gold NWs enabled
   their implantation and recording of single neuron-activities in a live
   mouse brain despite a similar to 50 x reduction of the size compared to
   the closest analogues. Reduction of electrode dimensions enabled
   recording of neural activity with improved spatial resolution and
   differentiation of brain activity in response to different social
   situations for mice. The successful localization of the epileptic
   seizure center was also achieved using a multielectrode probe as a
   demonstration of the diagnostics potential of NW electrodes. This study
   demonstrated the realism of single-neuron recording using
   subellular-sized electrodes that may be considered a pivotal point for

Abstract = {{Auger recombination is a significant loss mechanism in many
   optoelectronic devices. We use first-principles methods based on density
   functional theory to study the relative importance of direct and
   indirect phonon-assisted Auger recombination in GaAs and related alloys.
   Energy and momentum, of the recombining electron-hole pair can be
   transferred, to an Auger eleetron, (eeh process) or an Auger hole (hhe
   process). For eeh processes, the direct process is negligibly small
   compared to the phonon-assisted indirect process in GaAs, while in hhe
   processes the direct and phonon-assisted processes contribute almost
   equally The hole processes are about 5 times stronger than the electron
   processes. In alloys with lower band gaps, the eeh processes become
   stronger, and below a band gap of 0.8 eV they are as relevant as the
   hole processes. Our results highlight the importance of indirect
   processes, even at low band gaps.}},

Abstract = {{Cell instructive mineralized biomaterials are a promising alternative to
   conventional auto-, allo-, and xenograft therapies for the
   reconstruction of critical sized defects. Extracellular matrix proteins,
   peptide domains, and functional motifs demonstrating cell and mineral
   binding activity have been used to improve cell attachment. However,
   these strategies vary in their tissue regeneration outcomes due to lack
   of specificity to both regenerative cell populations and the material
   substrates. In order to mediate cell-specific interactions on apatite
   surfaces, we identified peptide sequences with high affinity towards
   apatite (VTKHLNQISQSY, VTK) and clonally derived human bone marrow
   stromal cells (DPIYALSWSGMA, DPI) using phage display. The primary aims
   of this study were to measure apatite binding affinity, human bone
   marrow stromal cell (hBMSC) adhesion strength, and peptide specificity
   to hBMSCs when the apatite and cell-specific peptides are combined into
   a dual-functioning peptide. To assess binding affinity to hydroxyapatite
   (HA), binding isotherms were constructed and peptide binding affinity
   (K-1) determined. HBMSC, MC3T3 and mouse dermal fibroblast (MDF)
   adhesion strength on biomimetic apatite functionalized with single-and
   dual-functioning peptide sequences were evaluated using a centrifugation
   assay. DPI-VTK had the highest binding strength towards hBMSCs (p<0.01).
   DPI-VTK, while promoting strong initial attachment to hBMSCs, did not
   encourage strong adhesions to MC3T3s or fibroblasts (p<0.01). Taken
   together, phage display is a promising strategy to identify preferential
   cell and material binding peptide sequences that can tether specific
   cell populations onto specific biomaterial chemistries.}},

Abstract = {{Four model-based State of Charge (SOC) estimation methods for

   Different from existing literatures, this work evaluates different

   etc. The equivalent model of the battery is introduced and the state
   function of the model is deduced. The four model-based SOC estimation
   methods are analyzed first. Simulations and experiments are then
   established to evaluate the four methods. The urban dynamometer driving
   schedule (UDDS) current profiles are applied to simulate the drive
   situations of an electrified vehicle, and a genetic algorithm is
   utilized to identify the model parameters to find the optimal parameters
   of the model of the Li-ion battery. The simulations with and without
   disturbance are carried out and the results are analyzed. A battery test

Abstract = {{In this paper, we formulate a contract design problem where a primary
   license holder wishes to profit from its excess spectrum capacity by
   selling it to potential secondary users/buyers. It needs to determine
   how to optimally price the excess spectrum so as to maximize its profit,
   knowing that this excess capacity is stochastic in nature, does not come
   with exclusive access, and cannot provide deterministic service
   guarantees to a buyer. At the same time, buyers are of different types,
   characterized by different communication needs, tolerance for the
   channel uncertainty, and so on, all of which are a buyer's private
   information. The license holder must then try to design different
   contracts catered to different types of buyers in order to maximize its
   profit. We address this problem by adopting as a reference a traditional
   spectrum market where the buyer can purchase exclusive access with
   fixed/deterministic guarantees. We fully characterize the optimal
   solution in the cases where there is a single buyer type, and when
   multiple types of buyers share the same known channel condition as a
   result of the primary user activity. In the most general case, we
   construct an algorithm that generates a set of contracts in a
   computationally efficient manner and show that this set is optimal when
   the buyer types satisfy a monotonicity condition.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration and noise analysis of complex mechanical systems is very
   difficult by traditional technologies. We present a novel technology to
   analyze the vibration and noise of complex structures. This technology
   can be divided into three stages step by step. First, it is necessary to
   process the load simplification, modal analysis, vibration and noise
   testing in the preparation stage. Then, in the vibration analysis stage,
   a virtual far-field excitation method is presented to obtain more
   accurate vibration response results in the near-field and far-field
   response points, of which the nonlinear behaviors need not be
   considered. And the solver error caused by the distance between the
   excitation point and response points could be reduced. Last, in the
   noise analysis stage, a modal partition method is put forward to solve
   the structure radiated noise according to the distributions of the
   low-level modal shapes, which is a rapid and efficient method to obtain
   a radiated noise distribution for the complex structures. On the whole,
   this technology has potential applications in vibro-acoustic problems
   solving for the complex systems in practical engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: A tibial plafond allograft, iliac crest allograft, and
   coracoid autograft in a congruent arc Latarjet reconstruction better
   restore radius of curvature, depth, and surface area for glenoid bone
   loss in recurrent instability compared with the coracoid autograft in a
   standard Latarjet reconstruction for anteroinferior glenoid bone loss of
   the shoulder.
   Methods: Three-dimensional shoulder models were generated from bilateral
   computed tomography scans in 15 patients, who were a mean (standard
   deviation {[}SD]) age of 23 (7.7) years, with recurrent anterior
   shoulder instability and known glenoid bone loss. The surface areas of
   the glenoid in the involved and contralateral normal shoulder were
   measured. Virtual surgery was then performed using standard and
   congruent arc Latarjet reconstruction, tibial plafond, and iliac crest
   allografts. Grafts were optimally positioned to restore articular
   congruity and defect fill. Radius of curvature and restoration of
   glenoid depth were compared with the contralateral glenoid.
   Results: Glenoid surface area (11.04\% {[}6.95\% SD]) and depth (0.75
   {[}0.57 SD] vs 1.44 {[}0.65 SD] mm) were significantly reduced (P <
   .012) in the injured glenoid. The mean (SD) coronal plane radius of
   curvature of the congruent arc Latarjet reconstruction (60.3 {[}39.0 SD]
   mm) more closely matched the radius of curvature of the injured glenoid
   (67.5 {[}33.2 SD] mm) compared with the other grafts. Restored glenoid
   depth was greater in the tibial plafond (1.8 {[}1.1 SD] mm) and iliac
   crest (2.0 {[}0.6 SD] mm) allografts compared with other grafts (P <
   .002).
   Conclusion: Congruent arc Latarjet reconstruction more closely restores
   native glenoid coronal radius of curvature, whereas tibial plafond and
   iliac crest allografts more adequately restore depth compared with
   standard Latarjet reconstruction. (C) 2014 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow

Abstract = {{A silicon-based laser, preferably electrically pumped, has long been a

   time, an edge-emitting InGaN/GaN disk-in-nanowire array electrically

   substrate. The devices display excellent dc and dynamic characteristics
   with values of threshold current density, differential gain, T-0 and
   small signal modulation bandwidth equal to 1.76 kA/cm(2), 3 X 10(-17)
   cm(2), 232 K, and 5.8 GHz respectively under continuous wave operation.
   Preliminary reliability measurements indicate a lifetime of 7000 h. The
   emission wavelength can be tuned by varying the alloy composition in the
   quantum disks. The monolithic nanowire laser on (001)Si can therefore

Abstract = {{In this article, we study a biobjective economic lot-sizing problem with

   to minimize the total lot-sizing costs including production and

   production and inventory block expenditure. We derive (almost) tight
   complexity results for the Pareto efficient outcome problem under
   nonspeculative lot-sizing costs. First, we identify nontrivial problem
   classes for which this problem is polynomially solvable. Second, if we
   relax any of the parameter assumptions, we show that (except for one
   case) finding a single Pareto efficient outcome is an NP-hard task in
   general. Finally, we shed some light on the task of describing the

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Compressed sensing (CS) is a powerful new data acquisition paradigm that
   seeks to accurately reconstruct unknown sparse signals from very few
   (relative to the target signal dimension) random projections. The
   specific objective of this study is to save wireless sensor energy by
   using CS to simultaneously reduce data sampling rates, on-board storage
   requirements, and communication data payloads. For field-deployed low
   power wireless sensors that are often operated with limited energy
   sources, reduced communication translates directly into reduced power
   consumption and improved operational reliability. In this study,
   acceleration data from a multi-girder steel-concrete deck composite
   bridge are processed for the extraction of mode shapes. A wireless
   sensor node previously designed to perform traditional uniform, Nyquist
   rate sampling is modified to perform asynchronous, effectively
   sub-Nyquist rate sampling. The sub-Nyquist data are transmitted off-site
   to a computational server for reconstruction using the CoSaMP matching
   pursuit recovery algorithm and further processed for extraction of the
   structure's mode shapes. The mode shape metric used for reconstruction
   quality is the modal assurance criterion (MAC), an indicator of the
   consistency between CS and traditional Nyquist acquired mode shapes. A
   comprehensive investigation of modal accuracy from a dense set of
   acceleration response data reveals that MAC values above 0.90 are
   obtained for the first four modes of a bridge structure when at least
   20\% of the original signal is sampled using the CS framework. Reduced
   data collection, storage and communication requirements are found to
   lead to substantial reductions in the energy requirements of wireless
   sensor networks at the expense of modal accuracy. Specifically, total
   energy reductions of 10-60\% can be obtained for a sensor network with
   10-100 sensor nodes, respectively. The reduced energy requirements of
   the CS sensor nodes are shown to directly result in improved battery
   life and communication reliability.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that angiogenesis plays an important role in bone
   regeneration and that release of angiogenic and osteogenic growth
   factors can enhance bone formation. Multiple growth factors play key
   roles in processes that lead to tissue formation/regeneration during
   natural tissue development and repair. Therefore, treatments aiming to
   mimic tissue regeneration can benefit from multiple growth factor
   release, and there remains a need for simple clinically relevant
   approaches for dual growth factor release. We hypothesized that mineral
   coatings could be used as a platform for controlled incorporation and
   release of multiple growth factors. Specifically, mineral-coated
   scaffolds were ``dip coated{''} in multiple growth factor solutions, and
   growth factor binding and release were dictated by the growth
   factor-mineral binding affinity. Beta tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP)
   scaffolds were fabricated using indirect solid-free form fabrication
   techniques and coated with a thin conformal mineral layer.
   Mineral-coated beta-TCP scaffolds were sequentially dipped in
   recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor (rhVEGF) and a
   modular bone morphogenetic peptide, a mineral-binding version of bone
   morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), solutions to allow for the incorporation
   of each growth factor. The dual release profile showed sustained release
   of both growth factors for over more than 60 days. Scaffolds releasing
   either rhVEGF alone or the combination of growth factors showed an
   increase in blood vessel ingrowth in a dose-dependent manner in a sheep
   intramuscular implantation model. This approach demonstrates a ``modular
   design{''} approach, in which a controllable biologics carrier is
   integrated into a structural scaffold as a thin surface coating.}},

Abstract = {{Use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) in unconventional
   reservoirs to recover previously inaccessible oil and natural gas is
   rapidly expanding in North America and elsewhere. Although hydraulic
   fracturing has been practiced for decades, the advent of more
   technologically advanced horizontal drilling coupled with improved
   slickwater chemical formulations has allowed extensive natural gas and
   oil deposits to be recovered from shale formations. Millions of liters
   of local groundwaters are utilized to generate extensive fracture
   networks within these low-permeability reservoirs, allowing extraction
   of the trapped hydrocarbons. Although the technology is relatively
   standardized, the geographies and related policies and regulations
   guiding these operations vary markedly. Some ecosystems are more at risk
   from these operations than others because of either their sensitivities
   or the manner in which the HVHF operations are conducted. Generally, the
   closer geographical proximity of the susceptible ecosystem to a drilling
   site or a location of related industrial processes, the higher the risk
   of that ecosystem being impacted by the operation. The associated
   construction of roads, power grids, pipelines, well pads, and
   water-extraction systems along with increased truck traffic are common
   to virtually all HVHF operations. These operations may result in
   increased erosion and sedimentation, increased risk to aquatic
   ecosystems from chemical spills or runoff, habitat fragmentation, loss
   of stream riparian zones, altered biogeochemical cycling, and reduction
   of available surface and hyporheic water volumes because of
   withdrawal-induced lowering of local groundwater levels. The potential
   risks to surface waters from HVHF operations are similar in many ways to
   those resulting from agriculture, silviculture, mining, and urban
   development. Indeed, groundwater extraction associated with agriculture
   is perhaps a larger concern in the long term in some regions.
   Understanding the ecological impacts of these anthropogenic activities
   provides useful information for evaluations of potential HVHF hazards.
   Geographic information system-based modeling combined with strategic
   site monitoring has provided insights into the relative importance of
   these and other ecoregion and land-use factors in discerning potential
   HVHF impacts. Recent findings suggest that proper siting and operational
   controls along with strategic monitoring can reduce the potential for
   risks to aquatic ecosystems. Nevertheless, inadequate data exist to
   predict ecological risk at this time. The authors suggest considering
   the plausibility of surface water hazards associated with the various
   HVHF operations in terms of the ecological context and in the context of
   relevant anthropogenic activities. (C) 2014 SETAC}},

Abstract = {{Modern social networks frequently encompass multiple distinct types of
   connectivity information; for instance, explicitly acknowledged friend
   relationships might complement behavioral measures that link users
   according to their actions or interests. One way to represent these
   networks is as multi-layer graphs, where each layer contains a unique
   set of edges over the same underlying vertices (users). Edges in
   different layers typically have related but distinct semantics;
   depending on the application multiple layers might be used to reduce
   noise through averaging, to perform multifaceted analyses, or a
   combination of the two. However, it is not obvious how to extend
   standard graph analysis techniques to the multi-layer setting in a
   flexible way. In this paper we develop latent variable models and
   methods for mining multi-layer networks for connectivity patterns based
   on noisy data.}},

Abstract = {{Significant efforts have gone into the development of statistical models
   for analyzing data in the form of networks, such as social networks.
   Most existing work has focused on modeling static networks, which
   represent either a single time snapshot or an aggregate view over time.
   There has been recent interest in statistical modeling of dynamic
   networks, which are observed at multiple points in time and offer a
   richer representation of many complex phenomena. In this paper, we
   present a state-space model for dynamic networks that extends the
   well-known stochastic blockmodel for static networks to the dynamic
   setting. We fit the model in a near-optimal manner using an extended
   Kalman filter (EKF) augmented with a local search. We demonstrate that
   the EKF-based algorithm performs competitively with a state-of-the-art
   algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling but is
   significantly less computationally demanding.}},

Abstract = {{Socially-based recommendation systems have recently attracted
   significant interest, and a number of studies have shown that social
   information can dramatically improve a system's predictions of user
   interests. Meanwhile, there are now many potential applications that
   involve aspects of both recommendation and information retrieval, and
   the task of collaborative retrieval-a combination of these two
   traditional problems-has recently been introduced. Successful
   collaborative retrieval requires overcoming severe data sparsity, making
   additional sources of information, such as social graphs, particularly
   valuable. In this paper we propose a new model for collaborative
   retrieval, and show that our algorithm outperforms current
   state-of-the-art approaches by incorporating information from social
   networks. We also provide empirical analyses of the ways in which
   cultural interests propagate along a social graph using a real-world

Abstract = {{We describe the integration of a flexible UHF antenna with an epitaxial
   lift-off thin-film III-V solar cell array used for power generation and
   wireless communication in a flapping-wing robotic platform. The antenna
   is configured to utilize the cells and their interconnections as a part
   of the radiating element, leading to compact multifunctional
   antenna/solar cell array surface. The high junction capacitance of
   individual solar cells allows RF current conduction through the cells
   without an associated power penalty. Metallic interconnects in the solar
   cell array carry both the DC power as well as forming part of the UHF
   antenna. To suppress RF current leakage into the DC circuit used for
   conducting the solar cell current, a RF choke is inserted between the
   antenna and the solar cells in the DC path. The performance
   characteristics of the integrated antenna and solar cell array verify
   the predicted performance of the antenna for reliable communication.
   Further, mounting the thin film solar cell array on a 25 mu m thick
   Kapton sheet is shown to be a robust power source when positioned on the
   flexible wings of flapping robotic platforms. Details about design
   procedure and performance of the proposed integrated antenna are

   Design Ex-vivo drilling tests with controlled speed, feed, and depth
   were performed on cortical bone samples. Thermocouples were embedded
   underneath the drilling path to compare the temperature rises under mist
   cooling (at 3 degrees C, < 300 mL/h) and flood irrigation (at 22 degrees
   C, > 800 mL/h).
   Results A significant difference exists between these two systems (p
   value < 0.05). The measured temperature was similar to 4 degrees C lower
   for mist cooling than for flood irrigation, even with less than a third
   of the flow rate.
   Conclusion Experimental data indicate the capability of mist cooling to
   reduce heat generation while simultaneously enabling flow reduction and
   targeted cooling. An improved field of view in an extremely narrow
   access corridor may be achieved with this technology.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, we report on the development of supported Ni and Raney Ni
   catalysts doped with Cu for the hydrothermal hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of

   reduction in gasification activity and produce a higher yield of liquid
   products than the unmodified Raney Ni catalyst. Adding Cu did not,
   however, increase the yield of the desired HDO products, liquid
   hydrocarbons. The addition of acid sites to the catalysts, by supporting
   Ni and NiCu on Al2O3 and by calcining the Raney Ni to produce Al2O3
   within the catalyst, however, did significantly increase the HDO
   activity of the catalysts such that yields of liquid hydrocarbons
   exceeded 60\%. Two catalysts, a novel calcined 5\% Raney NiCu catalyst
   and a NiCu/Al2O3 catalyst, produced the highest liquid hydrocarbon

Abstract = {{By modelling seizure dynamics mathematically, Jirsa et al. develop a
   taxonomy of seizures based on first principles. Using a canonical model
   ('Epileptor') and experimental validation, they demonstrate that
   seizures with focal onset mostly fall into one particular class that is
   universal across brain regions and species, from flies to
   humans.Seizures can occur spontaneously and in a recurrent manner, which
   defines epilepsy; or they can be induced in a normal brain under a
   variety of conditions in most neuronal networks and species from flies
   to humans. Such universality raises the possibility that invariant
   properties exist that characterize seizures under different
   physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we analysed seizure
   dynamics mathematically and established a taxonomy of seizures based on
   first principles. For the predominant seizure class we developed a
   generic model called Epileptor. As an experimental model system, we used
   ictal-like discharges induced in vitro in mouse hippocampi. We show that
   only five state variables linked by integral-differential equations are
   sufficient to describe the onset, time course and offset of ictal-like
   discharges as well as their recurrence. Two state variables are
   responsible for generating rapid discharges (fast time scale), two for
   spike and wave events (intermediate time scale) and one for the control
   of time course, including the alternation between `normal' and ictal
   periods (slow time scale). We propose that normal and ictal activities
   coexist: a separatrix acts as a barrier (or seizure threshold) between
   these states. Seizure onset is reached upon the collision of normal
   brain trajectories with the separatrix. We show theoretically and
   experimentally how a system can be pushed toward seizure under a wide
   variety of conditions. Within our experimental model, the onset and
   offset of ictal-like discharges are well-defined mathematical events: a
   saddle-node and homoclinic bifurcation, respectively. These bifurcations
   necessitate a baseline shift at onset and a logarithmic scaling of
   interspike intervals at offset. These predictions were not only
   confirmed in our in vitro experiments, but also for focal seizures
   recorded in different syndromes, brain regions and species (humans and
   zebrafish). Finally, we identified several possible biophysical
   parameters contributing to the five state variables in our model system.
   We show that these parameters apply to specific experimental conditions
   and propose that there exists a wide array of possible biophysical
   mechanisms for seizure genesis, while preserving central invariant
   properties. Epileptor and the seizure taxonomy will guide future
   modeling and translational research by identifying universal rules
   governing the initiation and termination of seizures and predicting the
   conditions necessary for those transitions.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral computed tomography (CT) provides information on material
   characterization and quantification because of its ability to separate
   different basis materials. Dual-energy (DE) CT provides two sets of
   measurements at two different source energies. In principle, two
   materials can be accurately decomposed from DECT measurements. However,
   many clinical and industrial applications require three or more material
   images. For triple-material decomposition, a third constraint, such as
   volume conservation, mass conservation or both, is required to solve
   three sets of unknowns from two sets of measurements. The recently
   proposed flexible image-domain (ID) multi-material decomposition) method
   assumes each pixel contains at most three materials out of several
   possible materials and decomposes a mixture pixel by pixel. We propose a
   penalized-likelihood (PL) method with edge-preserving regularizers for
   each material to reconstruct multi-material images using a similar
   constraint from sinogram data. We develop an optimization transfer
   method with a series of pixel-wise separable quadratic surrogate (PWSQS)
   functions to monotonically decrease the complicated PL cost function.
   The PWSQS algorithm separates pixels to allow simultaneous update of all
   pixels, but keeps the basis materials coupled to allow faster
   convergence rate than our previous proposed material- and pixel-wise SQS
   algorithms. Comparing with the ID method using 2-D fan-beam simulations,
   the PL method greatly reduced noise, streak and cross-talk artifacts in
   the reconstructed basis component images, and achieved much smaller root
   mean square errors.}},

Abstract = {{Treatments to reduce fracture rates in adults with osteogenesis
   imperfecta are limited. Sclerostin antibody, developed for treating
   osteoporosis, has not been explored in adults with OI. This study
   demonstrates that treatment of adult OI mice respond favorably to
   sclerostin antibody therapy despite retention of the OI-causing defect.
   Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable collagen-related bone
   dysplasia, characterized by brittle bones with increased fracture risk.
   Although OI fracture risk is greatest before puberty, adults with OI
   remain at risk of fracture. Antiresorptive bisphosphonates are commonly
   used to treat adult OI, but have shown mixed efficacy. New treatments
   which consistently improve bone mass throughout the skeleton may improve
   patient outcomes. Neutralizing antibodies to sclerostin (Scl-Ab) are a
   novel anabolic therapy that have shown efficacy in preclinical studies
   by stimulating bone formation via the canonical wnt signaling pathway.
   The purpose of this study was to evaluate Scl-Ab in an adult 6 month old
   Brtl/+ model of OI that harbors a typical heterozygous OI-causing Gly >
   Cys substitution on Col1a1.
   Six-month-old WT and Brtl/+ mice were treated with Scl-Ab (25 mg/kg,
   2x/week) or Veh for 5 weeks. OCN and TRACP5b serum assays, dynamic
   histomorphometry, microCT and mechanical testing were performed.
   Adult Brtl/+ mice demonstrated a strong anabolic response to Scl-Ab with
   increased serum osteocalcin and bone formation rate. This anabolic
   response led to improved trabecular and cortical bone mass in the femur.
   Mechanical testing revealed Scl-Ab increased Brtl/+ femoral stiffness
   and strength.
   Scl-Ab was successfully anabolic in an adult Brtl/+ model of OI.}},

   Z-pin composite and a composite without Z-pins. Crack propagation
   changes from unstable propagation to stable propagation (crack arrest)
   as the Z-pin density increases. The additional fracture toughness
   provided by Z-pins prevents the primary crack to further propagate,
   enabling secondary and tertiary cracks to consume additional energy.
   While the primary crack is held from propagating by the frictional
   forces provided by Z-pins, the matrix in the composite is driven into
   the plastic state and enables the composite to absorb more energy. For
   numerical simulations, a discrete cohesive zone model (DCZM) is used to
   perform simulations. The simulations in conjunction with experimental
   results provide critical fracture toughness values. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: Small-tip fast recovery (STFR) imaging is a recently proposed
   steady-state sequence that has similar image contrast as balanced
   steady-state free precession but has the potential to simultaneously
   remove banding artifacts and transient fluctuation. STFR relies on a
   ``tip-up{''} radiofrequency (RF) pulse tailored to the accumulated phase
   during the free precession (data acquisition) interval, designed to
   bring spins back to the longitudinal axis, thereby preserving transverse
   magnetization as longitudinal magnetization for the next pulse
   repetition time. We recently proposed an RF-spoiled STFR sequence
   suitable for thin slab imaging, however, in many applications, e. g.,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging or isotropic-resolution structural
   imaging, three-dimensional (3D) steady-state imaging is desirable.
   Unfortunately, 3D STFR imaging is challenging due to the need for 3D
   tailored RF pulses. Here, we propose new strategies for improved 3D STFR
   imaging, based on (i) unspoiled imaging, and (ii) joint design of
   nonslice-selective tip-down/tip-up RF pulses.
   Theory and Methods: We derive an analytic signal model for the proposed
   unspoiled STFR sequence, and propose two strategies for designing the 3D
   tailored tip-down/tip-up RF pulses. We validate the analytic results
   using phantom and in vivo imaging experiments.
   Results: Our analytic model and imaging experiments demonstrate that the
   proposed unspoiled STFR sequence is less sensitive to tip-up excitation
   error compared to the corresponding spoiled sequence, and may,
   therefore, be an attractive candidate for 3D imaging. The proposed
   ``joint{''} RF pulse design method, in which we formulate the
   tip-down/tip-up RF pulse design task as a magnitude least squares
   problem, produces modest improvement over a simpler ``Separate{''}
   design approach. Using the proposed unspoiled sequence and joint RF
   pulse design, we demonstrate proof-of-principle 3D STFR brain images
   with balanced steady-state free precession-like signal properties but
   with reduced banding.
   Conclusion: Using the proposed unspoiled sequence and joint RF pulse
   design, STFR brain images in a 3D region of interest with balanced
   steady-state free precession-like signal properties but with reduced
   banding can be obtained. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of polypropylene (PP) composites with short,
   wheat straw natural-fiber reinforcements are studied in tension at
   various temperatures and rates of loading. Specimens of two fiber
   lengths have been considered with both closed-form, microcellular voids
   and in solid form. Results of mechanical stress-strain tests are given
   at static to moderate rates of strain, specifically 0.0005/5, 0.025/s
   and 14/s. Testing at these strain rates is conducted up to specimen
   failure at low, room and high temperatures of -30 degrees C, 22 degrees
   C, and 107 degrees C, respectively. Primary findings suggest that fibers
   increase the tangent modulus and ultimate stress, while reducing the
   failure strain, compared to pure polymer. The presence of microcellular
   voids generally reduces ultimate strength, but does not reduce failure
   strain. In many cases, the microcellular composites display reduced rate
   sensitivity that would result in the development of lower stress than
   solid counterparts during high rate and/or high strain events. The
   performance difference between the two fiber cases studied here is
   largest at room temperature and quasi-static strain rates, and in most
   cases becomes insignificant with increasing or decreasing temperature
   and increasing strain rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The vast majority of multi-exon genes in humans undergo alternative
   splicing, which greatly increases the functional diversity of protein
   species. Predicting functions at the isoform level is essential to
   further our understanding of developmental abnormalities and cancers,
   which frequently exhibit aberrant splicing and dysregulation of isoform
   expression. However, determination of isoform function is very
   difficult, and efforts to predict isoform function have been limited in
   the functional genomics field. Deep sequencing of RNA now provides an
   unprecedented amount of expression data at the transcript level. We
   describe here emerging computational approaches that integrate such
   large-scale whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data for predicting
   the functions of alternatively spliced isoforms, and we discuss their
   applications in developmental and cancer biology. We outline future
   directions for isoform function prediction, emphasizing the need for
   heterogeneous genomic data integration and tissue-specific, dynamic
   isoform-level network modeling, which will allow the field to realize
   its full potential.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   To present the recent advances in the treatment of facial paralysis,
   emphasizing the emerging technologies. This review will summarize the
   current state of the art in the management of facial paralysis and
   discuss the advances in nerve regeneration, facial reanimation, and use
   of novel biomaterials. This review includes surgical innovations in
   reinnervation and reanimation as well as progress with bioelectrical
   interfaces.
   Recent findings
   The last decade has witnessed major advances in the understanding of
   nerve injury and approaches for management. Key innovations include
   strategies to accelerate nerve regeneration, provide tissue-engineered
   constructs that may replace nonfunctional nerves, approaches to
   influence axonal guidance, limiting of donor-site morbidity, and
   optimization of functional outcomes. Approaches to muscle transfer
   continue to evolve, and new technologies allow for electrical nerve
   stimulation and use of artificial tissues.
   Summary
   The fields of biomedical engineering and facial reanimation increasingly
   intersect, with innovative surgical approaches complementing a growing
   array of tissue engineering tools. The goal of treatment remains the
   predictable restoration of natural facial movement, with acceptable
   morbidity and long-term stability. Advances in bioelectrical interfaces
   and nanotechnology hold promise for widening the window for successful
   treatment intervention and for restoring both lost neural inputs and
   muscle function.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic analysis of structures with localized nonlinearities, such
   as intermittent contacts of cracked structures, is a computationally
   demanding task because of the large size of the models involved. Thus,
   high-resolution finite element models are often reduced using a variety
   of specialized techniques which exploit spatial coherences in the
   dynamics. In addition, when a steady-state forced response analysis is
   performed, direct time integration can be replaced with multi-harmonic
   balance methods. Recently, a technique based on bi-linear normal modes
   has been successfully applied to piecewise-linear oscillators. The key
   idea of that approach is to represent the spatial coherences in the
   system dynamics with two sets of normal modes with special boundary
   conditions, referred to as bi-linear modes. In this paper, the bi-linear
   modal representation is extended to the case of intermittent contacts
   with friction. Furthermore, a novel reduced order modeling method is
   developed for the 0th order harmonic used in multi-harmonic balance
   methods. The forced response of a cracked structure is used to
   demonstrate the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial evidence indicates that major psychiatric disorders are
   associated with distributed neural dysconnectivity, leading to a strong
   interest in using neuroimaging methods to accurately predict disorder
   status. In this work, we are specifically interested in a multivariate
   approach that uses features derived from whole-brain resting state
   functional connectomes. However, functional connectomes reside in a high
   dimensional space, which complicates model interpretation and introduces
   numerous statistical and computational challenges. Traditional feature
   selection techniques are used to reduce data dimensionality, but are
   blind to the spatial structure of the connectomes. We propose a
   regularization framework where the 6-D structure of the functional
   connectome (defined by pairs of points in 3-D space) is explicitly taken
   into account via the fused Lasso or the GraphNet regularizer. Our method
   only restricts the loss function to be convex and margin-based, allowing
   non-differentiable loss functions such as the hinge-loss to be used.
   Using the fused Lasso or GraphNet regularizer with the hinge-loss leads
   to a structured sparse support vector machine (SVM) with embedded
   feature selection. We introduce a novel efficient optimization algorithm
   based on the augmented Lagrangian and the classical alternating
   direction method, which can solve both fused Lasso and GraphNet
   regularized SVM with very little modification. We also demonstrate that
   the inner subproblems of the algorithm can be solved efficiently in
   analytic form by coupling the variable splitting strategy with a data
   augmentation scheme. Experiments on simulated data and resting state
   scans from a large schizophrenia dataset show that our proposed approach
   can identify predictive regions that are spatially contiguous in the 6-D
   ``connectome space,{''} offering an additional layer of interpretability
   that could provide new insights about various disease processes. (C)

Abstract = {{It is shown that assumed anelastic relaxation-time spectra can be
   recovered reliably from simulated loss modulus curves that include noise
   by nonlinear least-squares fitting. The same method is used to obtain
   spectra for published experimental data on a metallic glass. The results
   provide a comprehensive kinetic picture of the atomically quantized
   hierarchy of shear transformation zones (STZs). We resolve a window of
   STZs consisting of 25-33 atoms, and a simultaneous fit yields the
   Arrhenius behavior for each size. The corresponding activation energies
   are 1.75-2.31 eV. The high activation energy that is often observed
   above T-g is shown to be an artifact of the temperature dependence of
   the high-frequency shear modulus. The hierarchy of STZ sizes is
   consistent with both alpha and beta relaxations, suggesting that they
   originate from the same microscopic mechanism. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia

   Rigorous statistical analysis accounted for variability between human

   sensing differentiated controls from thermally-stressed and from
   metabolically-stressed constructs. Fluorescence lifetime-based sensing
   differentiated controls from thermally-stressed constructs. Unlike
   traditional histological (found to be generally reliable, but
   destructive) and biochemical (non-invasive, but found to be unreliable)
   tissue analyses, label-free optical assessments had the advantages of
   being both non-invasive and reliable. Thus, such optical measures could
   serve as reliable manufacturing release criteria for cell-based
   tissue-engineered constructs prior to human implantation, thereby
   addressing a critical regulatory need in regenerative medicine. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Adult multipotent stem cells have been isolated from a variety of human
   tissues including human skeletal muscle, which represent an easily
   accessible source of stem cells. It has been shown that human skeletal
   muscle-derived stem cells (hMDSCs) are muscle-derived mesenchymal stem
   cells capable of multipotent differentiation. Although hMDSCs can
   undergo osteogenic differentiation and form bone when genetically
   modified to express BMP2; it is still unclear whether hMDSCs are as
   efficient as human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) for bone
   regeneration. The current study aimed to address this question by
   performing a parallel comparison between hMDSCs and hBMMSCs to evaluate
   their osteogenic and bone regeneration capacities. Our results
   demonstrated that hMDSCs and hBMMSCs had similar osteogenic-related gene
   expression profiles and had similar osteogenic differentiation
   capacities in vitro when transduced to express BMP2. Both the
   untransduced hMDSCs and hBMMSCs formed very negligible amounts of bone
   in the critical sized bone defect model when using a fibrin sealant
   scaffold; however, when genetically modified with lenti-BMP2, both
   populations successfully regenerated bone in the defect area. No
   significant differences were found in the newly formed bone volumes and
   bone defect coverage between the hMDSC and hBMMSC groups. Although both
   cell types formed mature bone tissue by 6 weeks post-implantation, the
   newly formed bone in the hMDSCs group underwent quicker remodelling than
   the hBMMSCs group. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that hMDSCs
   are as efficient as hBMMSCs in terms of their bone regeneration
   capacity; however, both cell types required genetic modification with
   BMP in order to regenerate bone in vivo. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Robust network design against attacks is one of the most fundamental
   issues in Internet of Things (IoT) architecture as IoT operations highly
   rely on the support of the underlaying communication infrastructures. In
   this paper, the vulnerability of IoT infrastructure under intentional
   attacks is investigated by relating the network resilience to the
   percolation-based connectivity. Intentional attacks impose severe
   threats on the network operations as it can effectively disrupt a
   network by paralyzing a small fraction of nodes, and therefore
   deteriorating IoT operations. A fusion-based defense mechanism is
   proposed to mitigate the damage caused by such attacks, where each node
   feedbacks minimum (one-bit) local decision to the fusion center for
   attack inference. By formulating the attack and defense strategy as a
   zero-sum game, the outcome of the game equilibrium is used to evaluate
   the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism. The robustness of the
   Internet-oriented and the cyber-physical system (CPS)-oriented networks
   are specifically analyzed to illustrate the foundation of future IoT
   infrastructure. Both analytical and empirical results show that the
   proposed mechanism greatly enhances the robustness of IoT, even in the
   weak local detection capability and fragile network structure regime.}},

   strengths of three fundamental interactions, i.e. the electron-electric
   potential interaction, the electron-magnetic potential/field interaction
   and the spin-orbit coupling are discussed. The results suggest that the
   perturbation energies of the last two interactions are in an order of
   10(3)-10(4) smaller than that of the first one for electron vortices. In
   addition, it is also found that the strengths of these interactions are
   strongly dependant on the spatial distributions of the electromagnetic
   field as well as the electron vortices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A shell element for analysis of textile composite structures is proposed
   in this paper. Based on the embedded element method and solid shell
   concept, the architecture, geometry, and material properties of a repeat

   finite element. Flat and curved textile composite structures are used to
   apply and verify the present shell element. The deformation and natural
   frequency obtained by the present shell element are compared against
   those computed from full three-dimensional finite element analyses. It
   is shown that the proposed shell element is efficient, simple, and

Abstract = {{Spark assist (SA) has been demonstrated to extend the operating limits
   of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) modes of engine
   operation. This experimental investigation focuses on the effects of
   100\% indolene and 70\% indolene/30\% ethanol blends on the ignition and
   combustion properties during SA HCCI operation. The spark assist effects
   are compared to baseline HCCI operation for each blend by varying spark
   timing at different fuel/air equivalence ratios ranging from Phi =
   0.4-0.5. High speed imaging is used to understand connections between
   spark initiated flame propagation and heat release rates. Ethanol
   generally improves engine performance with higher net indicated mean
   effective pressure (IMEPn) and higher stability compared to 100\%
   indolene. SA advances phasing within a range of similar to 5 crank angle
   degrees (CAD) at lower engine speeds (700 rpm) and similar to 11 CAD at
   higher engine speeds (1200 rpm). SA does not affect heat release rates
   until immediately (within similar to 5 CAD) prior to auto-ignition.
   Unlike previous SA HCCI studies of indolene fuel in the same engine,
   flames were not observed for all SA conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an analysis of neutron transport in the interior of model
   pebble bed reactor (PBR) cores, considering both crystal and random
   pebble arrangements. Monte Carlo codes were developed for (i) generating
   random realizations of the model PBR core, and (ii) performing neutron
   transport inside the crystal and random heterogeneous cores; numerical
   results are presented for two different choices of material parameters.
   These numerical results are used to investigate the anisotropic behavior
   of neutrons in each case and to assess the accuracy of estimates for the
   diffusion coefficients obtained with the diffusion approximations of
   different models: the atomic mix model, the Behrens correction, the
   Lieberoth correction, the generalized linear Boltzmann equation (GLBE),
   and the new GLBE with angular-dependent path-length distributions. This
   new theory utilizes a non-classical form of the Boltzmann equation in
   which the locations of the scattering centers in the system are
   correlated and the distance-to-collision is not exponentially
   distributed; this leads to an anisotropic diffusion equation. We show
   that the results predicted using the new GLBE theory are extremely
   accurate, correctly identifying the anisotropic diffusion in each case
   and greatly outperforming the other models for the case of random
   systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for multidisciplinary design optimization
   of offshore wind turbines at system level. The formulation and
   implementation that enable the integrated aerodynamic and structural
   design of the rotor and tower simultaneously are detailed. The objective
   function to be minimized is the levelized cost of energy. The model
   includes various design constraints: stresses, deflections, modal
   frequencies and fatigue limits along different stations of the blade and
   tower. The rotor design variables are: chord and twist distribution,
   blade length, rated rotational speed and structural thicknesses along
   the span. The tower design variables are: tower thickness and diameter
   distribution, as well as the tower height. For the other wind turbine
   components, a representative mass model is used to include their dynamic
   interactions in the system. To calculate the system costs,
   representative cost models of a wind turbine located in an offshore wind
   farm are used. To show the potential of the method and to verify its
   usefulness, the 5 MW NREL wind turbine is used as a case study. The
   result of the design optimization process shows 2.3\% decrease in the
   levelized cost of energy for a representative Dutch site, while
   satisfying all the design constraints. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Lean gasoline engines running on ethanol/gasoline blends and equipped
   with a silver/alumina catalyst for selective catalytic reduction (SCR)
   of NO by ethanol provide a pathway to reduced petroleum consumption
   through both increased biofuel utilization and improved engine
   efficiency relative to the current stoichiometric gasoline engines that
   dominate the U.S. light duty vehicle fleet. A pre-commercial
   silver/alumina catalyst demonstrated high NO chi conversions over a
   moderate temperature window with both neat ethanol and ethanol/gasoline
   blends containing at least 50\% ethanol. Selectivity to NH3 increases
   with HC dosing and ethanol content in gasoline blends, but appears to
   ``saturate{''} at around 45\%. NO2 and acetaldehyde behave like
   intermediates in the ethanol SCR of NO. NH3 SCR of NO chi does not
   appear to play a major role in the ethanol SCR reaction mechanism.
   Ethanol is responsible for the low temperature SCR activity observed
   with the ethanol/gasoline blends. The gasoline HCs do not deactivate the
   ethanol SCR activity, but they also do not appear to be significantly
   activated by the presence of ethanol. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights
