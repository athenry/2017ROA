Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a multi-scale simulation process
   for modelling the response of a vehicle with composite armour to the
   blast loads from an explosive threat. The new process can be used for
   improving the blast resistant capabilities of the composite armour by
   configuring its properties at the micro-level. A Blast Event Simulation
   sysTem (BEST), for conducting a complete sequence of explosive
   simulations, comprises one of the two main foundation components of the
   new development. The Micromechanics Analysis Code (MAC) comprises the
   second main foundation component. The development of the new multi-scale
   simulation capability and an associated case study are presented.}},

Title = {{An efficient optimal design methodology for non-linear multibody

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VEHICLE DESIGN}},

Volume = {{61}},

Pages = {{177-203}},
Abstract = {{The need exists for robust and efficient optimal design methods for
   application to multibody systems, in which the components to be designed
   represent connections between large displacement, large rotation motions
   of the subsystems' bodies. One specific application is occupant
   restraint systems, such as the Gunner Restraint System (GRS), in which
   both the vehicle and the gunner can undergo large relative and absolute
   motions under extreme driving or external threat conditions. In
   addition, the restraint/connection components can have
   amplitude-dependent, time-dependent, and timing-dependent behaviour,
   such as an active belt retractor. Current optimisation methodologies are
   ill suited for this problem, suffering from infeasibility, lack of
   robustness, and/or high computational expense. This paper presents an
   extension of topology optimisation techniques to consider multibody
   dynamics systems and to treat a much more open design space, which can
   include passive, active, and reactive structures/devices. The objective
   is to obtain an optimally combined structural and material system,
   considering the best use of passive, active and reactive members.}},

Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{219-232}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we will investigate performance relationships between
   electric machines whose dimensions are related by a uniform scaling
   factor. It is shown, assuming that the voltages applied to the scaled
   machine windings possess the same magnitude as those applied to the
   original `unit' machine, that a corresponding scaling of the time domain
   ensures the magnetic fields in the machine are consistent with the
   original, unscaled machine. Furthermore, under the assumption of linear
   thermal conduction within the machine materials, it is shown that the
   temperature profile is consistent as well, provided the scaled cooling
   system can maintain the same temperatures at the machine's boundaries.
   This serendipitous result allows for straightforward scaling of machine
   performance characteristics, such as torque-speed curves and efficiency
   maps, which may be particularly useful for variable-speed and automotive
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Composites of extracellular matrix proteins reinforced with carbon
   nanotubes have the potential to be used as conductive biopolymers in a
   variety of biomaterial applications. In this study, the effect of
   functionalization and polymer wrapping on the dispersion of multiwalled
   carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in aqueous media was examined. Carboxylated
   MWCNT were wrapped in either Pluronic (R) F127 or gelatin. Raman
   spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that covalent
   functionalization of the pristine nanotubes disrupted the carbon lattice
   and added carboxyl groups. Polymer and gelatin wrapping resulted in
   increased surface adsorbed oxygen and nitrogen, respectively. Wrapping
   also markedly increased the stability of MWCNT suspensions in water as
   measured by settling time and zeta potential, with Pluronic (R)-wrapped
   nanotubes showing the greatest effect. Treated MWCNT were used to make
   3D collagenfibrinMWCNT composite materials. Carboxylated MWCNT resulted
   in a decrease in construct impedance by an order of magnitude, and
   wrapping with Pluronic (R) resulted in a further order of magnitude
   decrease. Functionalization and wrapping also were associated with
   maintenance of fibroblast function within proteinMWCNT materials. These
   data show that increased dispersion of nanotubes in proteinMWCNT
   composites leads to higher conductivity and improved cytocompatibility.
   Understanding how nanotubes interact with biological systems is
   important in enabling the development of new biomedical technologies.

Title = {{In situ rheology of Staphylococcus epidermidis bacterial biofilms}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{122-131}},
Abstract = {{We developed a method to grow Staphylococcus epidermidis bacterial
   biofilms and characterize their rheological properties in situ in a
   continuously fed bioreactor incorporated into a parallel plate
   rheometer. The temperature and shear rates of growth modeled bloodstream
   conditions, a common site of S. epidermidis infection. We measured the
   linear elastic (G') and viscous moduli (G `') of the material using
   small-amplitude oscillatory rheology and the yield stress using
   non-linear creep rheology. We found that the elastic and viscous moduli
   of the S. epidermidis biofilm were 11 +/- 3 Pa and 1.9 +/- 0.5 Pa at a
   frequency of 1 Hz (6.283 rad per s) and that the yield stress was
   approximately 20 Pa. We modeled the linear creep response of the biofilm
   using a Jeffreys model and found that S. epidermidis has a
   characteristic relaxation time of approximately 750 seconds and a linear
   creep viscosity of 3000 Pa s. The effects on the linear viscoelastic
   moduli of environmental stressors, such as NaCl concentration and
   extremes of temperature, were also studied. We found a non-monotonic
   relationship between moduli and NaCl concentrations, with the stiffest
   material properties found at human physiological concentrations (135
   mM). Temperature dependent rheology showed hysteresis in the moduli when
   heated and cooled between 5 degrees C and 60 degrees C. Through these
   experiments, we demonstrated that biofilms are rheologically complex
   materials that can be characterized by a combination of low modulus
   (similar to 10 Pa), long relaxation time (similar to 10(3) seconds), and
   a finite yield stress (20 Pa). This suggests that biofilms should be
   viewed as soft viscoelastic solids whose properties are determined in
   part by local environmental conditions. The in situ growth method
   introduced here can be adapted to a wide range of biofilm systems and
   applied over a broad spectrum of rheological and environmental
   conditions because the technique minimizes the risk of irreversible,
   non-linear deformation of the microbial specimen before analysis.}},

Abstract = {{ZnTe doped with high concentrations of oxygen has been proposed in
   previous works as intermediate band (IB) material for photovoltaic
   applications. The existence of extra optical transitions related to the
   presence of an IB has already been demonstrated in this material and it
   has been possible to measure the absorption coefficient of the
   transitions from the valence band (VB) to the IB. In this work we
   present the first measurement of the absorption coefficient associated
   to transitions from the IB to the conduction band (CB) in ZnTe:O.
   The samples used are 4 mu m thick ZnTe layers with or without 0 in a
   concentration similar to 10(19) cm(-3), which have been grown on
   semi-insulating GaAs substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The
   IB-CB absorption coefficient peaks for photon energies similar to 0.4
   eV. It is extracted from reflectance and transmittance spectra measured
   using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Under typical FTIR
   measurement conditions (low light intensity, broadband spectrum) the
   absorption coefficient in IB-to-CB transitions reaches 700 cm(-1) This
   is much weaker than the one observed for VB-IB absorption. This result
   is consistent with the fact that the IB is expected to be nearly empty
   of electrons under equilibrium conditions in ZnTe(: O).
   The absorption for VB to IB transitions is also observed in the same
   samples through reflectance measurements performed in the visible range
   using a monochromator.}},

Abstract = {{Robust high-dimensional data processing has witnessed an exciting
   development in recent years, as theoretical results have shown that it
   is possible using convex programming to optimize data fit to a low-rank
   component plus a sparse outlier component. This problem is also known as
   Robust PCA, and it has found application in many areas of computer
   vision. In image and video processing and face recognition, an exciting
   opportunity for processing of massive image databases is emerging as
   people upload photo and video data online in unprecedented volumes.
   However, the data quality and consistency is not controlled in any way,
   and the massiveness of the data poses a serious computational challenge.
   In this paper we present t-GRASTA, or ``Transformed GRASTA (Grassmannian
   Robust Adaptive Subspace Tracking Algorithm){''}. t-GRASTA performs
   incremental gradient descent constrained to the Grassmann manifold of
   subspaces in order to simultaneously estimate a decomposition of a
   collection of images into a lowrank subspace, a sparse part of
   occlusions and foreground objects, and a transformation such as rotation
   or translation of the image. We show that t-GRASTA is 4x faster than
   state-of-the-art algorithms, has half the memory requirement, and can
   achieve alignment for face images as well as jittered camera
   surveillance images.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate enhanced sensitivity to refractive index (n) change in
   THz sensing by using the spoofed surface plasmon polariton (SSPP)
   architecture modified with gap blocks. The transmission peak as a
   function of n is significantly sharpened through the introduction of the
   additional cavity resonance, and such phenomenon is strongly dependent
   on the geometric dimensions of the block structure as well as the choice
   of probe frequencies. Non-invasive THz bio-sensing is a promising
   alternative to conventional tagging-based sensing schemes. In response
   to the growing demand for lower detection limit, our SSPP gap structure
   can effectively reduce the sample usage by enabling localized sample
   deposition within the gap cavity. The differentiation of DNA molecules
   with distinct binding states is demonstrated, where the conformational
   change of a thin layer (1 mu m) of immobilized DNA can lead to
   significant switching of the waveguide transmittance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of path control for a road vehicle
   immediately after it is disturbed by an initial light collision.
   Assuming that the driver cannot adequately control the vehicle during
   such an event, active chassis controls such as front steering and
   friction brakes are applied to minimize the risk and/or severity of a
   secondary impact, e.g. with roadside objects. Statistics have shown that
   traffic accidents where a vehicle suffers more than one collision
   comprise about 25\% of all passenger car accidents. In this paper, the
   crash risk for secondary collisions is formulated via a cost function
   and an optimal controller is developed. The cost function may penalize
   both longitudinal and lateral deviations from the point of initial
   impact, and is assumed here to be a time-integrated quadratic function
   of position. For closed-loop implementation this is further approximated
   using a simple terminal velocity cost, the direction of which represents
   predicted locations of maximum risklharm. A six-state quasi-linear path
   controller is developed using nonlinear optimal control theory. Example
   cases are presented, verifying approximate equivalency between cost
   functions and satisfactory control performance compared with independent
   open-loop numerical optimizations.}},

Abstract = {{The recent progress in advanced vehicle control systems presents a great
   opportunity for application of model predictive control (MPC) in
   automotive industry. However, high computational complexity inherently
   associated with the receding horizon optimization must be addressed to
   achieve the real-time implementation. This paper presents a general
   scale reduction framework to reduce the online computational burden of
   MPC controllers. A lower dimensional MPC algorithm is developed by
   integrating an existing `move blocking' (MB) strategy with a `constraint
   set compression' (CSC) strategy, which is first proposed here. Good
   trade-off between control optimality and computational intensity is
   achieved by proper design of blocking and compression matrices.
   Application of the fast algorithm on vehicular following control (e.g.
   an adaptive cruise control system) was evaluated through real-time
   simulation. These results indicate that the proposed method
   significantly improves the computational speed while maintaining
   satisfactory control optimality without sacrificing the desired
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{For hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) that have predictable routes, it is
   beneficial to use model predictive control (MPC) to derive the optimal
   control trajectories that can minimize fuel consumption while achieving
   other objectives. However, for applications such as city buses and
   delivery trucks, even though the driving routes are pre-determined, the
   loads of the vehicles are changing from time to time. The trajectories
   computed by the dynamic programming (DP) or other optimization
   algorithms based on the pre-defined model might not be optimal during
   real-time operation. Therefore, an adaptive control design with on-line
   vehicle parameter estimator is needed to account for those unpredictable
   changes. In this work, we propose an adaptive model predictive control
   (AMPC) design that can estimate and update the vehicle mass in
   real-time. A comparative case study is conducted to analyze the
   effectiveness of adaptation by comparing the AMPC and non-adaptive MPC
   in terms of fuel economy. An MPC algorithm based on DP is integrated
   with a parameter estimation algorithm based on the least squares,
   simulation results based on a comprehensive vehicle model is presented
   in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{For decades, application of National Electrical Code (NEC) rules for
   sizing services, feeders and branch circuits has resulted in unused
   capacity in almost all occupancy classes. US Department of Energy data
   compiled in 1999 indicates average load on building transformers between
   10 and 25 percent. More recent data gathered by the educational
   facilities industry has verified this claim. Recognizing that aggressive
   energy codes are driving energy consumption lower, and that larger than
   necessary transformers create larger than necessary flash hazard, the
   2014 NEC will provide an exception in Section 220.12 that will permit
   designers to reduce transformer kVA ratings and all related components
   of the power delivery system. This is a conservative, incremental step
   in the direction of reduced load density that is limited to lighting
   systems. More study of feeder and branch circuit loading is necessary to
   inform discussion about circuit design methods in future revisions of
   the NEC.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the following group learning problem in the context of
   opinion diffusion: Consider a network with M users, each facing N
   options. In a discrete time setting, at each time step, each user
   chooses K out of the N options, and receive randomly generated rewards,
   whose statistics depend on the options chosen as well as the user
   itself, and are unknown to the users. Each user aims to maximize their
   expected total rewards over a certain time horizon through an online
   learning process, i.e., a sequence of exploration (sampling the return
   of each option) and exploitation (selecting empirically good options)
   steps. Different from a typical regret learning problem setting (also
   known as the class of multi-armed bandit problems), the group of users
   share information regarding their decisions and experiences in a
   broadcast network. The challenge is that while it may be helpful to
   observe others' actions in one's own learning (i.e., second-hand
   learning), what is considered desirable option for one user may be
   undesirable for another (think of restaurant choices), and this
   difference in preference is in general unknown a priori. Even when two
   users happen to have the same preference (e.g., they agree one option is
   better than the other), they may differ in their absolute valuation of
   each individual option.
   Within this context we consider two group learning scenarios, (1) users
   with uniform preferences and (2) users with diverse preferences, and
   examine how a user should construct its learning process to best extract
   information from others' decisions and experiences so as to maximize its
   own reward. Performance is measured in weak regret, the difference
   between the user's total reward and the reward from a user-specific best
   single-action policy (i.e., always selecting the set of options
   generating the highest mean rewards for this user). Within each scenario
   we also consider two cases: (i) when users exchange full information,
   meaning they share the actual rewards they obtained from their choices,
   and (ii) when users exchange limited information, e.g., only their
   choices but not rewards obtained from these choices. We show the gains
   from group learning compared to individual learning from one's own
   choices and experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Educational research provides ample evidence of the benefits of
   effective group work for engineering students including improved
   material retention, development of higher-order cognitive skills, and
   higher performance(1). This work also describes best practices in the
   creation of effective student teams including suggestions for team size,
   the placement of students in teams, and student diversity. While
   diversity in this context includes a broad range of considerations
   spanning abilities and perspectives, Tonso(2) suggests that teams should
   include racial and ethnic diversity specifically, whenever possible.
   However, research has shown that despite best practices, women or
   minorities on teams can experience negative outcomes. Their perspectives
   are not always considered valid by majority teammates, and they are
   often assigned unimportant tasks(3,4), reflecting a societal stereotype
   of majority men as engineering ``experts.{''} Moreover,
   under-representation of one's social group (e.g., gender or race) in the
   academic environment can lead to reduced performance as a result of
   stereotype threat, i.e. the concern that poor performance may appear
   stereotype-confirming to others(5,6,7). The isolation that these
   students feel on their teams may lead to diminished feelings of
   belonging in their field and lower retention among these individuals(8).
   Despite the employment of best practices, our earlier analysis of
   approximately 600 undergraduates involved in group oral presentations
   reveals that women on first-year engineering project teams exhibit less
   active participation than men, and that this happens regardless of the
   representation of women on the team. Men are disproportionately more
   likely to present the technical content in oral presentations than
   women, to speak longer than expected and longer than women, and to field
   more audience questions than women(9,10). In addition, students' self
   reported learning from the project is positively correlated with taking
   on active presentation roles, roles primarily adopted by men.
   This paper provides a summary of the statistical findings of adding an
   additional 500 first year student participants to the prior work,
   lending further validity to our initial findings. To complement these
   quantitative results, we also describe the results of a focus group
   study, involving students who were enrolled in the targeted engineering
   course in a prior term. Themes emerging from the focus groups highlight
   the presence of gender stereotypic role adoption. Although students in
   general felt that teams strive for fairness in determining roles, those
   roles were recognizably aligned along stereotypical lines. Despite this
   recognition students thought this phenomenon was mostly self-determined,
   and that they were not pressured into it. Stereotyping was evidenced in
   reports of women most often taking on organizational roles, taking
   notes, scheduling meetings, and distributing agendas. Of interest, women
   saw these nontechnical roles as less desirable because these are seen by
   others as insubstantial, but these were the very roles that women were
   most often taking on. Thus, we were able to document that gender
   stereotypes influenced the roles adopted by men and women in their group
   project presentations and that students, while recognizing the
   stereotypical patterns of behavior, do not recognize the influence that
   conforming to these patterns has on their educational outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Though a majority of engineering PhD students begin their doctoral
   career shortly after completing an undergraduate degree, what we call
   direct-pathway students, a significant minority of students are
   ``returners,{''} students who pursue a PhD after working outside of
   academia for five or more years. In the first phase of a three year
   NSF-funded study to characterize the population of returning engineering
   PhD students, we developed a nationally-distributed survey to compare
   experiences and perspectives of returners and direct-pathway students.
   The survey development was grounded in Eccles' Expectancy Value Theory
   (EVT), as well as literature on returning students and a pilot study.
   The survey included questions about students' motivation for returning,
   their previous work and school experience, their future career plans,
   the challenges of graduate school, and their strategies for adapting to
   these challenges. This paper presents the development of the survey, in
   which we highlight best practices from the literature that informed the
   development and refinement process. We show iterations of the survey and
   data from the advisory board and our cognitive interviews that informed
   the final version of the instrument.}},

Abstract = {{At large research universities, graduate students are often employed as
   teaching assistants (TAs) or graduate student instructors (GSIs) to
   support the educational mission of these institutions. In order to
   maintain a high quality of teaching, and to provide opportunities for
   graduate students to grow as teachers, the College of Engineering at the
   University of Michigan requires all new TAs to participate in a one-day
   training session prior to the start of the term and a follow-up practice
   teaching session focusing on active learning teaching methods later in
   the term. The purpose of this paper is to explore engineering graduate
   students' perceptions of their teaching experiences, especially their
   use of active learning teaching methods at a large public research
   university. This paper investigates how graduate student instructors
   describe and use `active learning' in their classes, and identifies
   potential factors that may contribute to the likelihood that a graduate
   student instructor will adopt these techniques in their teaching
   practice.
   To address these topics, all engineering TAs were invited to participate
   in an online survey which collected data about their teaching
   experiences (including terms of teaching and responsibilities), their
   definition of ``active learning,{''} and their use of these teaching
   methods. The data shows that the majority of respondents value ``good
   teaching{''} and can articulate how they apply active learning in their
   classes. Further, the majority apply these approaches at least once per
   week and believe they are ``somewhat successful{''} or ``very
   successful{''} with their implementation. Those respondents who did not
   use active learning were unsure how to use these methods in their
   specific class, believe that their teaching responsibilities did not
   allow them to use these approaches, or did not feel as though active
   learning was necessary. This paper examines these responses further to
   determine whether or not their teaching responsibilities, their
   confidence with a variety of teaching-related tasks (e.g., lesson
   planning, working with students, etc.), and use of teaching peer mentors
   influence their decisions to incorporate active learning into their
   teaching practice. Recommendations for faculty supervisors and TA
   training program organizers are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) by fast rotors near
   or at the pulmonary veins (PVs) is not fully understood. We believe that
   heterogeneous distribution of transmembrane currents in the PVs and LA
   junction (PV-LAJ) play a major in the localization of rotors in the PVs.
   We seek for pacing protocols and measurements that could be used to
   predict drift direction. Experimentally observed heterogeneities in the
   PV-LAJ were incorporated into 2D and pseudo-3D models of
   Courtemanche-Ramirez-Nattel-Kneller human atrial kinetics to simulate
   various conditions and investigate rotor drifting mechanisms and
   electrophysiological pacing predictors. Simulations with various hi
   gradient conditions and various current-voltage relationships,
   substantiated its major role in the rotor drift. Among various action
   potential properties tested, only MDP gradient was found to be a
   pacing-rate independent predictor of rotor drift direction. Our
   simulations suggest that hi heterogeneity is dominant in conveying the
   drift direction through its impact on the global excitability and
   refractoriness gradients and more importantly it is only reflected in
   pacing studies in a frequency dependent manner. Our results call out for
   precaution when extrapolating results determined from pacing studies,
   commonly peiformed at 2 Hz.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) is a re-emerging computing paradigm which
   enables ultra-low power and massive parallelism in important
   applications like real-time image processing. It is characterized by its
   use of pseudo-random numbers implemented by 0-1 sequences called
   stochastic numbers (SNs) and interpreted as probabilities. Accuracy is
   usually assumed to depend on the interacting SNs being highly
   independent or uncorrelated in a loosely specified way. This paper
   introduces a new and rigorous SC correlation (SCC) measure for SNs, and
   shows that, contrary to intuition, correlation can be exploited as a
   resource in SC design. We propose a general framework for analyzing and
   designing combinational circuits with correlated inputs, and demonstrate
   that such circuits can be significantly more efficient and more accurate
   than traditional SC circuits. We also provide a method of analyzing
   stochastic sequential circuits, which tend to have inherently correlated
   state variables and have proven very hard to analyze.}},

Abstract = {{Quasilinear Control (QLC) is a set of methods for analysis and design of
   systems with nonlinear actuators and sensors. The approach of QLC is
   based on the method of stochastic linearization, which replaces each
   nonlinearity with an equivalent gain and bias. In this paper, we apply
   QLC for controller design of a wind farm with multiple wind turbines.
   These turbines are modeled by a linear plant preceded by an asymmetric
   saturation nonlinearity, which accounts for limited availability of
   wind. It is shown, using numerical simulations, that the controllers
   obtained via QLC perform significantly better in a broad range of
   regimes as compared to those designed in our earlier work by ignoring
   the saturations.}},

Abstract = {{During mode transitions in advanced engines and powertrains, actuators
   (electronic throttle, fuel, spark timing, variable valve timing, etc.)
   need to be optimally coordinated to obtain the correct state for the
   next mode. Specific examples of mode changes include cylinder
   deactivation/reactivation transitions in variable displacement engines,
   combustion mode transitions in HCCI and DISI engines and clutch
   transitions between locked and unlocked states in dual clutch
   transmissions. Mode transitions lead naturally to optimal control
   problems that can be analyzed using the maximum principle and solved
   numerically. From this perspective, the paper considers in detail one of
   the simplest problems of its kind (which to the authors' knowledge has
   not been treated), the optimal control of intake manifold filling using
   the electronic throttle. This problem is relevant to variable
   displacement engines and to the fuel economy that these engines can
   achieve. The analysis of minimum time and Nonlinear Quadratic (NLQ)
   optimal control problems is presented for the nonlinear manifold filling
   dynamics based on the maximum principle and simulated optimal
   trajectories are reported. Then a recently proposed Iterative Model and
   Trajectory Refinement (IMTR) strategy for solving trajectory
   optimization problems is validated using the intake manifold pressure
   filling as a case study. Specifically, we demonstrate the convergence of
   IMTR to trajectories that are close enough to the trajectories obtained
   from the maximum principle.}},

   predictive control (MPC) strategies, which are alternatives to other
   classical (e.g. terminal cost/constraint-based) approaches. Both
   proposed strategies take advantage of a nown stabilizing controller and
   its associated Lyapunov function. The first strategy allows optimization
   of an arbitrary cost function at each stage, but guarantees stability by
   enforcing a decrease in the known Lyapunov function at the first step of
   each MPC state. The second strategy uses an averaged/summed Lyapunov
   function as the objective function. A combined strategy that enforces a
   decrease in a summed Lyapunov function while optimizing an arbitrary
   cost is also considered. The proposed strategies are applied to an
   example drawn from the class of linear systems subject to actuator
   saturation constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular lines are production systems consisting of cells comprised of
   machines performing similar operations. These systems are notorious for
   having excessively long lead time (LT), often orders of magnitude longer
   than processing time by all machines in the system. The main goal of
   this paper is to provide a plausible explanation of this phenomenon and
   offer methods for LT reduction. To accomplish this, the paper develops a
   technique for performance analysis of cellular lines with asymptotically
   reliable Bernoulli machines and uses it to analyze and control LT. It
   shows, in particular, that robustness of LT is a decreasing function of
   the number of machines in a cell. Thus, in cells with many machines,
   small variations in either release rates or machine efficiencies may
   lead to dramatic increases of LT, if operating points are not selected
   appropriately. A method for selecting appropriate operating points and,
   thus, controlling release rates and LT, is provided.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an approach and a specific algorithm to
   integrate a parameter estimation with the receding horizon model

   integrated perturbation analysis and sequential quadratic programming
   (IPA-SQP) framework. Previously this approach was exploited for repeated
   constrained optimization in MPC when the initial conditions change. It
   is now shown that a similar algorithm can be derived to perform MPC
   updates when model parameters change. The detailed algorithm derivation
   is presented, along with discussions on the performance and
   implementation. An example based on the nonlinear dynamics of an
   inverted pendulum on a cart is included to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of temperature inside a battery cell requires accurate
   information about the cooling condition even when the battery surface
   temperature is measured. This paper presents a model-based approach for
   estimating the temperature distribution inside a cylindrical battery
   under the unknown convective cooling condition. A reduced order thermal
   model using a polynomial approximation of the temperature profile inside
   the battery is used. A Dual Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF) is then
   applied for the identification of the convection coefficient and the
   estimation of the battery core temperature. Experimental results show
   that the proposed DEKF-based estimation method can provide an accurate
   prediction of the core temperature under the unknown cooling condition
   by measuring the battery current and voltage along with surface and

   illustrate the theory. We also consider the case of large-scale systems

   combined into a global estimate without iterative message-passing. We

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of energy constrained and noise-limited search
   for targets that are sparsely distributed over a large area. We propose
   a multiple-stage search algorithm that accounts for complex time-varying
   target behavior such as transitions among neighboring cells and varying
   target amplitudes. This work extends the adaptive resource allocation
   policy (ARAP) introduced in {[}Bashan et al, 2008] to policies with T >>
   2 stages. The proposed search strategy is driven by minimization of a
   surrogate function for energy constrained mean-squared error within
   locations containing targets. Exact optimization of the multi-stage
   objective function is infeasible, but myopic optimization yields a
   closed-form solution. We extend the myopic solution with non-myopic
   considerations that save a percentage of resources for exploring the
   scene at large. Empirical evidence suggests that the non-myopic policy
   performs significantly better than the myopic solution in terms of
   estimation error, probability of detection, and robustness to model
   mismatch. Moreover, the provided search policy has low computational
   complexity compared to state-of-the-art dynamic programming solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Modern social networks frequently encompass multiple distinct types of
   connectivity information; for instance, explicitly acknowledged friend
   relationships might complement behavioral measures that link users
   according to their actions or interests. One way to represent these
   networks is as multi-layer graphs, where each layer contains a unique
   set of edges over the same underlying vertices (users). Edges in
   different layers typically have related but distinct semantics;
   depending on the application, multiple layers might be used to reduce
   noise through averaging, perform multifaceted analyses, or a combination
   of the two. However, it is not obvious how to extend standard graph
   analysis techniques to the multi-layer setting in a flexible way. In
   this paper we develop latent variable models and methods for mining
   multi-layer networks for connectivity patterns based on noisy data.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing pervasiveness of social media creates new opportunities
   to study human social behavior, while challenging our capability to
   analyze their massive data streams. One of the emerging tasks is to
   distinguish between different kinds of activities, for example
   engineered misinformation campaigns versus spontaneous communication.
   Such detection problems require a formal definition of meme, or unit of
   information that can spread from person to person through the social
   network. Once a meme is identified, supervised learning methods can be
   applied to classify different types of communication. The appropriate
   granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from existing
   entities such as tags and keywords. Here we present a framework for the
   novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams
   of social data. We evaluate various similarity measures that leverage
   content, metadata, network features, and their combinations. We also
   explore the idea of pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. A
   systematic evaluation is carried out using a manually curated dataset as
   ground truth. Our analysis shows that pre-clustering and a combination
   of heterogeneous features yield the best trade-off between number of
   clusters and their quality, demonstrating that a simple combination
   based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as effective as a
   non-trivial optimization of parameters. Our approach is fully automatic,
   unsupervised, and scalable for real-time detection of memes in streaming
   data.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce an approach to sparsity penalized multi-class classifier
   design that accounts for multi-block structure of the data. The unified
   multi-class classifier is parameterized by a set of weights defined over
   the classes and over the blocks. The proposed sparse multi-block
   multi-class classifier imposes structured sparsity on the weights so
   that the same variables are selected for all classes and all blocks. The
   classifier is trained to minimize an objective function that captures
   the unified miss-classification probabilities of error over the classes
   in addition to the sparsity of the weights. The optimization of the
   objective function is implemented by a convex augmented Lagrangian and
   variable splitting method. This results in a classifier that
   automatically selects biomarkesr for inclusion or exclusion in the
   classifier and results in significantly improved classifier performance.
   The approach is illustrated on publicly available longitudinal gene
   microarray data.}},

   non-adaptive sensing. It is shown that the adaptation gain is related to
   the detectability of nonzero signal components as characterized by a
   Bhattacharyya coefficient, thus quantifying analytically the dependence
   on the sparsity level of the signal, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the
   sensing resource budget. The bound is shown to be a good approximation
   to the optimal two-stage gain through numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a framework for spatio-temporal correlation analysis of
   jointly Gaussian Wide Sense Stationary (WSS) multivariate time series.
   The goal is to identify the hub time series, i.e., the ones that are
   highly correlated with a number of other time series. When the dimension
   of the multivariate time series and the number of time samples are
   relatively large, direct correlation analysis in the time domain could
   be computationally intractable. As an alternative, we apply the Discrete
   Fourier Transform to the time series and perform correlation analysis in
   the frequency domain. We extend the previous theory of hub screening to
   the complex domain to accommodate complex-valued Fourier transforms. The
   theory allows p-values to be assigned to time series for being a hub
   under the null hypothesis that the time series are independent of each
   other. It also specifies thresholds for which thresholded sample
   (partial) correlation matrices can be used to identify hubs. We then use
   an independence property of Gaussian WSS time series in the frequency
   domain to perform multiple inference for detecting hub time series.
   Experimental results on both synthetic data and real financial data
   illustrate the accuracy of our theoretical results and the usefulness of
   the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate dynamic models of wind turbine generators are extremely
   important for assessing the effect of wind generation on power system
   dynamic performance. The paper considers a generic model for doubly-fed
   induction generator (type-3) wind turbines. It is shown that two of its
   modules, those associated with converter control and pitch control,
   duplicate an integrator that seeks to drive frequency error to zero. As
   a consequence of these duplicate integrators, the set of equations
   describing steady-state conditions is under-determined. Equilibria
   define a 1-manifold (curve) rather than the usual point solutions. It is
   shown that if the duplicated integrators are switched in unison, then
   pre- and post-disturbance equilibria will coincide. However if switching
   of the duplicated integrators is not coordinated, then post-disturbance
   transients will generically settle to a steady-state that differs from
   pre-disturbance conditions. These conclusions are illustrated using a
   standard WECC test case.}},

Abstract = {{Many methods have been proposed to solve the image classification
   problem for a large number of categories. Among them, methods based on
   tree-based representations achieve good trade-off between accuracy and
   test time efficiency. While focusing on learning a tree-shaped hierarchy
   and the corresponding set of classifiers, most of them {[}11, 2, 14] use
   a greedy prediction algorithm for test time efficiency. We argue that
   the dramatic decrease in accuracy at high efficiency is caused by the
   specific design choice of the learning and greedy prediction algorithms.
   In this work, we propose a classifier which achieves a better trade-off
   between efficiency and accuracy with a given tree-shaped hierarchy.
   First, we convert the classification problem as finding the best path in
   the hierarchy, and a novel branch-and-bound-like algorithm is introduced
   to efficiently search for the best path. Second, we jointly train the
   classifiers using a novel Structured SVM (SSVM) formulation with
   additional bound constraints. As a result, our method achieves a
   significant 4.65\%, 5.43\%, and 4.07\% (relative 24.82\%, 41.64\%, and
   109.79\%) improvement in accuracy at high efficiency compared to
   state-of-the-art greedy ``tree-based{''} methods {[}14] on Caltech-256
   {[}15], SUN {[}32] and Image-Net 1K {[}9] dataset, respectively.
   Finally, we show that our branch-and-bound-like algorithm naturally
   ranks the paths in the hierarchy (Fig. 8) so that users can further
   process them.}},

Abstract = {{The attitude dynamics of a spacecraft with a variable speed control
   moment gyroscope (VSCMG), in the presence of conservative external
   inputs, are derived in the framework of geometric mechanics. A complete
   dynamics model, that relaxes some of the assumptions made in prior
   literature on control moment gyroscopes, is obtained. These dynamics
   equations show the complex nonlinear coupling between the internal
   degrees of freedom associated with the CMG and the spacecraft base
   body's attitude degrees of freedom. General ideas on how this coupling
   can be used to control the angular momentum of the base body of the
   spacecraft using changes in the momentum variables of a finite number of
   VSCMGs, are provided. Placement of VSCMGs in the spacecraft base body is
   carried out in a manner that avoids singularities in the transformation
   between VSCMG angular rates and required instantaneous base body angular
   momentum. A control scheme using n VSCMGs for slew to rest attitude
   maneuvers in the absence of external torques and when the total angular
   momentum of the spacecraft is zero, is presented. Numerical simulation
   results obtained for a spacecraft with three VSCMGs confirm the
   stability properties of the feedback system.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-gigahertz AlGaN/GaN resonator is introduced, where the
   fundamental thickness-mode resonance at 2.1 GHz is excited exhibiting a
   quality factor (Q) of 105. For the first time, acoustic strain in the
   vertical direction is excited and sensed through a two-dimensional
   electron gas (2DEG), induced at the AlGaN/GaN interface. The 2DEG sheet
   is used as the bottom electrode for piezoelectric actuation, as well as
   the transistor conduction channel for acoustic sensing. In this design,
   acoustic resonance is sensed by modulation of the HEMT drain current
   (ID); thus, the transistor is biased in the linear region of operation.
   Here, we study the dependency of the acoustic transconductance on the
   readout HEMT biasing and show that the read-out HEMT senses the drain
   current modulation only when the 2DEG channel is not pinched. To use the
   full potential of the HEMT intrinsic amplification, the transistor needs
   to be biased in the saturation region, which would require a modified
   RB-HEMT design.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, sensitivity of active and passive (AP) observations at
   L-band to near-surface SM was analyzed for bare sandy soils. The
   complementarity of AP microwave observations was used to obtain
   realistic SM profile that matched well with both AP observations during
   dynamic moisture conditions. Active observations exhibit less
   sensitivity to SM changes and higher sensitivity to surface roughness
   than passive observations. Based upon these findings, the observed
   brightness temperatures (T(B)s) were used to estimate a SM profile using
   an emission model. The backscatter (sigma degrees) observations were
   used to estimate root mean square height (s) and correlation length (cl)
   using a backscatter model. The estimated SM profile, s, and cl resulted
   in RMSDs of 4.55K and 0.81dB between the observed and modeled T-B and
   sigma degrees values, respectively, for the rough surface. This study
   demonstrates the integrated use of AP to improve SM estimates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for estimating high dimensional
   covariance matrices. Our method, permuted rank-penalized least-squares
   (PRLS), is based on Kronecker product series expansions of the true
   covariance matrix. Assuming an i.i.d. Gaussian random sample, we
   establish high dimensional rates of convergence to the true covariance
   as both the number of samples and the number of variables go to
   infinity. For covariance matrices of low separation rank, our results
   establish that PRLS has significantly faster convergence than the
   standard sample covariance matrix (SCM) estimator. In addition, this
   framework allows one to tradeoff estimation error for approximation
   error, thus providing a scalable covariance estimation framework in
   terms of separation rank, an analog to low rank approximation of
   covariance matrices {[}1]. The MSE convergence rates generalize the high
   dimensional rates recently obtained for the ML Flip-flop algorithm
   {[}2], {[}3].}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a simple relay enabled medium access (SRMAC)
   protocol that enables cooperative relay transmissions. Due to the
   wireless signal power attenuation with distance, using a relay in a
   wireless network can make wireless networking more bandwidth efficient
   at the expense of requiring multiple transmissions for a single packet.
   Standard MAC protocols such as the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol, while
   useable with relaying, however are not designed explicitly for relay
   communication. When IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol is used for cooperative
   communication such a relaying, each packet transmission would need to
   separately contend for the channel via a channel access procedure which
   can use significant resources (both energy and bandwidth). Because using
   a single relay requires two transmissions, an efficient medium access
   control (MAC) protocol that supports two hop transmission is needed. We
   introduce a protocol, SRMAC, which is a simple cooperative MAC protocol
   that utilizes information from the physical layer for the MAC operation
   of relay networks. We consider the bandwidth efficiency of SRMAC
   protocol considering both the physical layer and MAC layer. The SRMAC
   protocol includes the possibility of both cooperative transmission and
   direct transmission. With SRMAC, cooperative transmission (relaying) can
   be dynamically chosen when it is more beneficial than direct
   transmission. The SRMAC protocol can improve the throughput by up to
   20\% compared to conventional MAC protocols.}},

Abstract = {{A novel photoconductive terahertz detector based on plasmonic contact
   electrode gratings is presented, which provides significantly higher
   detection sensitivities compared to conventional photoconductive
   terahertz detectors. Terahertz detection sensitivity enhancement is the
   result of reducing the average transport path of photo-generated
   carriers to the plasmonic contact electrodes, making it possible to
   generate higher output photocurrents under the same terahertz and pump
   power levels. We experimentally demonstrate a plasmonic photoconductive
   detector, which offers more than 30 times higher terahertz detection
   sensitivities compared to a comparable conventional photoconductive
   detector without plasmonic contact electrodes over 0.1-1.5 THz frequency
   range and under the same operation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Potential advantages of statistical image reconstruction (SIR) methods
   over conventional filtered back-projection (FBP) method include reduced
   patient dose, improved noise and spatial resolution properties. However,
   the use of statistical weightings and sophisticated modeling of the
   system that are responsible for these improvements can lead to
   anisotropic and nonuniform noise characteristics and spatial
   resolutions. As an extension to our previous work that aimed for more
   isotropic and uniform spatial resolution, we propose a quadratic
   regularization design method for 3D axial X-ray computed tomography (CT)
   to achieve isotropy and uniformity of noise characteristics in the
   reconstructed image. In practice, noise properties may affect diagnostic
   quality of the reconstructed image as much as the spatial resolution.
   Simulations and a phantom experiment demonstrate that the proposed
   method leads to more isotropic and uniform noise characteristics in 3D
   axial CT with modest computational cost.}},

   to reduce artifacts induced by cardiac motion. In this paper, we propose
   a new approach to estimating the motion of the coronary arteries. We use
   a simple linear model for the motion of each coronary artery during an
   axial scan and we estimate the model parameters in the sinogram domain.
   The purpose of the method is not to estimate the motion of the coronary
   arteries precisely, but rather to provide good initial estimates for
   subsequent joint image reconstruction and motion estimation.. The idea
   was evaluated with a cardiac CT simulation. Simulation results
   illustrate that our proposed method can provide reasonably good motion
   estimates that may be useful for initializing the joint estimation of
   both motion parameters and reconstructed images.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, spectral CT with photon counting detectors (PCDs) has
   exhibited more advantages compared to conventional CT systems. Spectral
   CT has the potential to substantially advance CT imaging by reducing
   image noise and dose, improving contrast and target specificity, and
   enabling functional imaging with special molecular markers (e. g. Gold
   nanoparticles). The current PCDs, however, is difficult to balance the
   amount of energy bins and the data noise of statistical fluctuation at
   each bins. More energy bins mean higher energy discriminating ability,
   but lower photon number at each bin. Moreover, in order to obtain enough
   energy bins, the current PCD is made up by small spectral detector
   subelements which have different thresholds. However, the more energy
   bins it has, the more complicated circuitry is. Hence, the PCD element
   becomes complex and large if we want many energy bins. Both spatial and
   energy resolutions are compromised. The state-of-the-art PCD has eight
   energy bins. It is difficult to make more energy bins. The overall goal
   of our research is to develop a hybrid detector which combines the
   integrating and dynamic-threshold counting modes. Its energy thresholds,
   or energy bins, can be flexibly arranged and dynamically changed during
   the spectral CT scanning. In each energy bin, current-integrating
   readouts are used. Thus, we can get many energy bins with very limited
   amount of PCD subelements. We develop a smart algorithm to reconstruct
   the true-color CT images by the data from this hybrid detector with
   adjustable energy thresholds (e. g. randomly changing). This paper will
   introduce this new spectral CT system with hybrid detector, its image
   reconstruction algorithm, and the simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Waste streams of fuel cycle, research facilities or decommissioning
   activities may contain measurable quantities of plutonium that must be
   accounted for under international safeguards agreements. Inspectors must
   perform measurements to verify operator declared plutonium masses within
   waste matrices. In some cases, inspectors might be asked to verify the
   presence of only a few grams of plutonium distributed in a waste drum.
   Neutron coincidence measurements are a standard tool to measure Pu-240
   content due to its high spontaneous fission rate. Given prior knowledge
   of isotopics, total plutonium mass can be estimated. For such
   measurements, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)
   maintains, tests and upgrades a He-3 drum monitor for deployment to
   European nuclear facilities at the request of EURATOM. This drum monitor
   consists of 148 standard He-3 tubes in a 4 pi geometry for passive
   neutron coincidence measurements using a shift register and standard
   INCC software. The neutron drum monitor is designed to handle standard
   208 L (55 gallon) waste drums. The drum counter's design is optimized to
   handle conditioned waste drums of low plutonium content. This
   nondestructive measurement tool recently underwent extensive electronic
   and structural refurbishments resulting in CE certification (compliance
   with relevant European Union legislation). Before redeployment, the
   passive neutron detection system must undergo an extensive measurement
   campaign to ascertain its limits of detection of plutonium in a variety
   of waste matrices. For this purpose, mock waste matrices were produced.
   These consist of concrete filled standard waste drums. A number of
   cavities at different distances from the drum center allow for a variety
   of source locations to be tested. Plutonium metal and oxide samples
   ranging from milligram to gram quantities were measured during this
   campaign.}},

Abstract = {{New generation of plastic scintillators have been developed at RMD for
   fast neutron detection technology. These plastics have peak emission
   wavelength similar to 440 nm, fast scintillation decay < 10 ns, light
   output similar to 13,000 photons/MeV, and excellent Pulse Shape
   Discrimination (PSD) between gamma rays and neutrons. We have achieved a
   Figure-of-Merit (FOM) of 2.3 at 1.0 MeVee electron energy threshold for
   a 2 inch diameter right cylinder sample. At RMD, comparative
   measurements were made between the plastic scintillator and Eljen liquid
   scintillator EJ309 both 1 inch diameter x 1 inch length. RMD plastic
   showed competitive performance. Additionally, in an experiment performed
   at the University of Kentucky 7 MV Van De Graaff accelerator, RMD
   plastic scintillator was irradiated with mono-energetic fast neutron
   beam energies up to 20.8 MeV. The results from this experiment confirm
   fast neutron spectroscopy capabilities. These results and effects of
   different electronic systems on the PSD measurements are discussed in
   this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Pixellated CdZnTe detectors have shown its potential to provide
   excellent spectroscopic performance at University of Michigan. To
   minimize charge loss in the gap between pixels, steering grid was used
   on standard Polaris CdZnTe detectors. Steering grid is biased and placed
   between pixels to force electrons to drift to anode pixels so that they
   won't be trapped in the gap. Such design is proven to be effective in
   improving the energy resolution of multi-pixel-triggered events. But on
   the other side biased steering grid increases the leakage current on
   pixels and complicates the detector fabrication. Therefore, detectors
   without steering grid (simple-pixel detectors) are investigated to see
   if they can provide similar performance as steering-grid detectors. This
   study has shown that simple-pixel detectors can provide similar
   spectroscopic performance of standard Polaris CdZnTe detectors using
   steering grid. The improvement on sub-pixel position resolution because
   of this design change is also reported.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of traffic information such as flow, density, speed,
   and travel time is an important component for traffic control systems
   and optimizing vehicle operation. Prediction of an individual speed
   profile on an urban network is a challenging problem because traffic
   flow on urban routes is frequently interrupted and delayed by traffic
   lights, stop signs, and intersections. In this paper, we present an
   Intelligent Speed Profile Prediction on Urban Traffic Network
   (ISPP\_UTN) that can predict a speed profile of a selected urban route
   with available traffic information at the trip starting time. ISPP\_UTN
   consists of four speed prediction Neural Networks (NNs) that can predict
   speed in different traffic areas. ISPP\_UTN takes inputs from three
   different categories of traffic information such as the historical
   individual driving data, geographical information, and traffic pattern
   data. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm gave good
   prediction results on real traffic data and the predicted speed profiles
   are close to the real recorded speed profiles.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the fundamental cause of anchor dissipation in
   Lame- or wineglass-mode resonators and show that by carefully optimizing
   the resonator tether geometry low anchor losses can be achieved, making
   it possible to reach the intrinsic fxQ limit of the resonating material.
   Through analytical and finite element investigation, we demonstrate that
   the anchor loss is most significant when the flexural-mode resonance
   frequency of the tether is in sync with the Lame-mode frequency of the
   resonating plate. This has a significant bearing on the design of
   Lame-mode resonators with release holes or temperature-compensation
   trenches, where the modification of the resonator structure requires
   modification to the tether geometry to maintain a high Q. We verify the
   predicted results through experimental measurements and present an
   optimized design that exhibits a mechanical Q of 408,270 for the
   fundamental Lame mode at 41.57 MHz. The fxQ for this device is
   1.7x10(13), one of the highest values reported in silicon.}},

Abstract = {{We present a photoconductive terahertz emitter that incorporates
   nanoscale plasmonic contact electrodes to offer significantly higher
   radiation powers compared to conventional photoconductive terahertz
   emitters. Radiation enhancement is the result of reducing the average
   transport path of photogenerated carriers to the plasmonic contact
   electrodes and, thus, increasing the number of the photocarriers that
   can be routed to the terahertz antenna in a sub-picosecond time-scale to
   efficiently contribute to terahertz radiation. We experimentally
   demonstrate up to 50 times higher terahertz radiation powers from the
   presented plasmonic photoconductive terahertz emitter compared to a
   similar conventional photoconductive terahertz emitter without plasmonic
   contact electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Occupant behavior in buildings can contribute significantly to building
   energy demand and consumption. As a result, occupant behavior
   interventions to promote sustainability are becoming more widespread.
   Due to the expense in applying interventions, researchers have begun
   using computer simulations to analyze potential outcomes and better
   understand how complex systems can affect intervention success, in
   particular the effect of social network structure. In previous
   literature, studies have only evaluated social network effects using
   static social networks which are far from reality. Therefore, in this
   study we evaluate how a behavior intervention, here a comparative
   feedback system, is affected as social networks evolve over time using
   agent-based modeling. Results indicate that static social networks are
   much less volatile in their behavior and tend to have more convergent
   behavior relative to dynamic social networks. This implies that for
   normative interventions, dynamic networks have increased uncertainty in
   intervention outcome compared to static networks.}},

Abstract = {{Workers' absence behavior is not only determined by individuals'
   personal characteristics or situations, but also strongly affected by
   workgroup-level properties, such as social norms. This is because
   workers gather the how-to-behave information not only from formal rules,
   but also by interacting with their peers to obtain group and
   organizational approval. Despite the increasing attention being paid to
   the social control of workers' absence behavior in organizations, to
   date relatively little work has been done studying the impact of
   workers' influence networks, in which the social control takes place, on
   absence behavior. In this paper, we apply agent-based modeling and
   simulation (ABMS) to study the impact of workers' influence networks on
   absence behavior. Our simulation results suggest that small social
   networks of workers could be more effective than big networks in
   reducing absenteeism when the social control is active.}},

Abstract = {{This research involved a meta-analysis of data sets from three prior
   empirical studies on pilot perceptions of clutter in aviation displays.
   The objectives were to assess the affects of cockpit display dynamics
   and aviation domain (fixed vs. vertical takeoff and landing) on
   perceived clutter based on overall ratings and a multi-dimensional score
   collected during simulated flight tasks. Comparisons were made of
   observations on pilots with similar levels of experience within domain
   using displays (head-down or head-up) with similar features in similar
   segments of landing approach scenarios. Results revealed both display
   dynamics and the flight domain to be significant in perceived clutter
   and the need for such factors to be incorporated in models and measures
   of clutter. The findings also emphasize the need for designers to
   consider how display features influence human information processing and
   how specific visual characteristics of displays may lead to perceptions
   of clutter and potential performance problems.}},

Abstract = {{On December 29th 2010. a 30 m high slope failed at the Xerolakka
   Municipal Solid Waste landfill in Greece. The failure resulted in
   temporary interruption of the landfill disposal activities and closure
   of the landfill access road: it also received significant media
   attention. A reconnaissance of the landfill slope instability was
   performed a few hours after the failure. Subsequent data collection,
   field investigations and numerical analyses were performed to better
   characterize the causes of the instability. Data collection included
   review of available data regarding the landfill design and the waste
   material at the Xerolakka landfill. Field investigations included Lidar
   surveying to closely map the post-failure geometry, as well as shear
   wave velocity measurements that were used as a basis for
   characterization of the MSW material and comparison with data available
   in the literature. Numerical analyses included limit equilibrium as well
   as finite clement analyses. The results of the investigation indicate
   that the failure was caused by a combination of factors, including,
   inappropriate waste disposal practices, inadequate compaction, leachate
   and gas pressure generation and increased steepening of the landfill
   slopes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents experiments in building a classifier for the
   automatic detection of deceit. Using a dataset of deceptive videos, we
   run several comparative evaluations focusing on the verbal component of
   these videos, with the goal of understanding the difference in deceit
   detection when using manual versus automatic transcriptions, as well as
   the difference between spoken and written lies. We show that using only
   the linguistic component of the deceptive videos, we can detect
   deception with accuracies in the range of 52-73\%.}},

Abstract = {{The present study is aimed at understanding the effects of thermal shock
   and associated microstructural features on the dynamic deformation
   mechanisms in Ti2AlC, a M(n+1)AX(n) phase ternary ceramic. These
   materials crystallize in a Hexagonal Close Packed (HCP) structure with a
   c/a ratio greater than 1.67 which results in kink band formations when
   subjected to loading. In this work, we report the microstructural
   changes associated with thermal shocking of M n+1AXn phases and its
   effects on deformation mechanisms, under dynamic compressive loading.
   The specimens are heated to temperatures of 220, 550 and 900 degrees C,
   held at each temperature for 5-10 minutes, and subsequently quenched in
   water at 20 degrees C to induce thermal shock. The thermal shock
   resistance and its effect on mechanical properties is investigated by
   subjecting heat treated specimens to compressive loading at high strain
   rates (-1000-4500 s(-1)) using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB).
   The microstructures of thermally shocked specimens are characterized by
   Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) combined with Energy Dispersive
   Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis to reveal the surface morphologies and
   characteristics. The displacements during the deformation events are
   captured using in situ high speed imaging, with fullfield 2D Digital
   Image Correlation (DIC) technique. The key microscale mechanisms of
   deformation are studied using SEM analysis of deformed/fractured
   specimens.}},

Abstract = {{The link of multilink suspension usually has bushings at both body
   connection and wheel carrier connection. These bushings are designed
   subjected to the function of link In the studies of vehicle dynamics,
   bushing could be represented by three translational stiffness and three
   torsional stiffness as well as corresponding damping. Due to specific
   location and orientation of each bushing, usually only one of these six
   stiffness plays an important role. In this paper, effect of bushing on
   suspension K\&C characteristics was investigated with a four-link
   suspension. Through virtual loading tests, force distribution of
   suspension bushing was studied to find the relation between bushing
   stiffness and K\&C characteristics. In order to quantitatively measure
   effect of bushing stiffness on parasitic rate, an ``equivalent force{''}
   method based on energy conservation was proposed. Similarly, an
   ``equivalent displacement{''} method was proposed to measure effect of
   bushing stiffness on suspension compliance. According to theoretical
   analysis and numerical calculation result, six stiffness of a bushing
   could be classified into three categories: main function stiffness
   closely related to suspension behavior, sub-function stiffness affecting
   parasitic rate or subjected to large load and non-function stiffness to
   be controlled within an acceptable range.}},

Abstract = {{Micro pumps are required in gas chromatographs and other gas analysis
   systems. Thermodynamic and reduced order models reported in the
   literature consider only the deflection of pumping membranes which is
   insufficient to study the performance characteristics of more
   complicated multistage peristaltic pumps with multiple coupled chambers,
   active checkerboard valves and single or multiple electrodes for
   actuating the pumping membranes and valves. Specifically the volume
   displaced by the valves membranes can be significant compared to the
   volume displaced by the pumping membranes. In this paper a multiphysics
   model is extended to include the effect of valves as well the pump
   membranes deflections. The viscous losses in the flow through the valves
   are modeled using CFD while the structural behavior of the membrane is
   modeled using COMSOL in quasi-steady analyses and the results
   incorporated into the multiphysics unsteady reduced-order model. The
   model is validated by comparing computed flow-rate as a function of
   frequency with experimental results for a 4-stage micropump which are
   found to be within 7\%. At a high flow rate condition the model results
   show that for a 4-stage pump the deflection of the valves significantly
   affects the performance of the pump.}},

Abstract = {{The outstanding properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) make them
   compelling materials for use in applications including nanoscale
   circuits, flexible conductors, battery electrodes, and reinforced
   composites; and their combination of attractive mechanical, thermal, and
   electrical properties makes them truly unique. However, as with any new
   material, practical use requires efficient and scalable processing
   methods, and commercial development requires these methods to be
   compatible with existing manufacturing platforms such as semiconductor
   processing. This chapter presents a thorough review of methods for
   integrating CNTs into micro-and nanodevices and systems, focusing on
   challenges of controlling CNT size and structure; precisely placing and
   packing CNTs; and achieving device-compatible growth and processing
   methods. Examples are selected across the spectrum from early-stage
   research to present commercialization. Overall, while we are far from
   meeting the aforementioned challenges, near-term uses of CNTs will
   include interconnects, non-volatile memory, inertial sensors, and
   thermal interfaces.}},

   on a thin film. The effect of the film thickness h on the spreading
   resistance is evaluated over a large range of the aspect ratio a/h, for
   both Cartesian and cylindrical geometries. In the limit h -> 0, the
   normalized spreading resistance converges to finite values. An
   interpretation of these limits is given, along with the implication of
   intense local heating at the rim of the a-spot. The analytic theory is
   extended to a-spots of arbitrary shape; and is applicable to AC bulk
   contact resistance calculations at sufficiently high excitation
   frequencies. Results of the analytic theory are compared with recent
   measurements and simulations of contact resistance in cylindrically
   symmetric contacts. Because existing models are generally valid over
   different ranges of contact radius and film thickness, even for an
   idealized geometry, this paper emphasizes the importance of comparing
   measured spreading resistance with values calculated from the model that
   is applicable to the experimental situation.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to derive and validate scaling
   relationships for flexible lifting bodies in transitional and turbulent
   flows. The motivation is to help the design and interpretation of
   reduced-scale experimental studies of flexible hydrofoils, with focus on
   the influence of viscous effects on the hydroelastic response. The
   numerical method is based on a previous validated viscous FSI solver
   presented in {[}1]. It is based on the coupling between a commercial
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver, CFX, and a simple
   two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) system that simulates the free tip
   section displacement of a cantilevered, rectangular hydrofoil. To
   validate the scaling relations, sample numerical results are shown for
   three geometrically similar models: full scale, 1/2 scale and 1/10
   scale. On the fluid side, although the effects of gravity and
   compressibility are assumed to be negligible, three different methods of
   scaling the velocity are considered: Reynolds scaling, Froude scaling,
   and Mach scaling. The three scaling methods produce different velocity
   scales when the fluid properties and gravitational constant are the same
   between the model and prototype, which will lead to different scaling
   for the material properties. The results suggest that by applying Mach
   scaling (which does not mean the flow is compressible, but simply
   requires the relative inflow velocity and fluid properties to be the
   same between the model and the prototype) and Re >= 2 x 10(6), the same
   material as the full scale could be used, which will lead to similar
   stress distributions, in addition to similar strains, and hence similar
   hydroelastic response and failure mechanisms. However, if Re <= 2 x
   10(6) and Mach scale is used, a viscous correction is required to
   properly extrapolate the experimental results to full-scale.}},

Abstract = {{In the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory of the University of Michigan,
   selectively located surface roughness has been designed successfully to
   suppress vortex-induced vibrations of a single cylinder by 60\% compared
   to a smooth cylinder. In this paper, suppression of flow-induced motions
   of two cylinders in tandem using surface roughness is studied
   experimentally by varying flow velocity and cylinder center-to-center
   spacing. The two identical cylinders are rigid, suspended by springs,
   and allowed to move transversely to the flow direction and their own
   axis. Surface roughness is applied in the form of four roughness strips
   helically placed around the cylinder. Results are compared to smooth
   cylinders also tested in this work. Amplitude ratio AID, frequency ratio
   f(osc)/f(n,water), and range of synchronization are measured. Regardless
   of the center-to-center cylinder distance, the amplitude response of the
   upstream smooth-cylinder is similar to that of the isolated
   smooth-cylinder. The wake from the upstream cylinder with roughness is
   narrower and longer and has significant influence on the amplitude of
   the downstream cylinder. The latter is reduced in the initial and upper
   branches while its range of VIV-synchronization is extended. In addition
   the amplitude of the upstream rough cylinder and its range of
   synchronization increase with respect to the isolated rough cylinder.}},

Abstract = {{Passive turbulence control (PTC) in the form of two straight roughness
   strips with variable width, and thickness about equal to the boundary
   layer thickness, is used to modify the flow-induced motions (FIM) of a
   rigid circular cylinder. The cylinder is supported by two end-springs
   and the flow is in the TrSL3, high-lift, regime. The PTC-to-FIM Map,
   developed in previous work, revealed zones of weak suppression, strong
   suppression, hard galloping, and soft galloping. In this paper the
   sensitivity of the PTC-to-FIM Map to: (a) the width of PTC covering, (b)
   PTC covering a single or multiple zones, (c) PTC being straight or
   staggered is studied experimentally. Experiments are conducted in the
   Low Turbulence Free Surface Water Channel of the University of Michigan.
   Fixed parameters are: cylinder diameter D=8.89cm, m{*}=1.725, spring
   stiffness K=763N/m, aspect ratio l/D=10.29, and damping ratio
   zeta=0.019. Variable parameters are: circumferential PTC location

   Re is an element of {[}30,000-120,000], flow velocity U is an element of

   roughness distribution is limited to remain within a zone, the width of
   the strips does not affect the FIM response. When multiple zones are
   covered, the strong suppression zone dominates the FIM.}},

Abstract = {{The simulation software FAST is an open source CAE package maintained by
   the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. A new module of FAST for
   assessing the dynamic response of offshore wind turbines subjected to
   ice forcing is presented. This paper describes the recent addition of
   capabilities for analyzing the response of wind turbines subjected
   forces resulting from ice impact on the turbine support structure.
   Several models are presented which involve both prescribed forcing and
   coupled response. For conditions in which the ice forcing is essentially
   de-coupled from the structural response, ice forces are established from
   existing models for brittle and ductile ice failure modes. For
   conditions in which the ice failure and the structural response are
   coupled, such as lock-in conditions, a rate-dependent ice model is
   described, which is developed in conjunction with a new modularization
   framework for FAST
   The ice loading module includes ice mechanics models, that incorporate
   ice floe forcing, deformation, and failure. For lower speeds, forces
   slowly build until the ice strength is reached and ice fails resulting
   in a quasi-static condition where the frequency of the forcing is about
   an order of magnitude lower than the response of the structure. For
   intermediate speeds, the ice failure response can be coupled with the
   structural response resulting in response where the ice feature failure
   period and the response period of the structure approximately coincide.
   A third response regime occurs at high speeds of encounter in which
   brittle fracturing of the ice feature in contact with the structure
   occur in a more or less random pattern, which results in random
   vibration excitation of the structure. These three conditions are
   specifically addressed in the ISO standard 19906:2010 for consideration
   in the design of arctic offshore structures. Special consideration of
   lock-in vibrations is required due to the detrimental effects of such
   response with regard to fatigue and foundation/soil response. The use of
   FAST for transient, time domain simulation with the new ice module is
   well suited for such analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-precision manufacturing (UPM) machines are used to fabricate and
   measure complex parts having micrometer-level features and
   nanometer-level tolerances/surface finishes. Therefore, low-frequency
   residual vibrations that occur during the motion of the machines' axes
   must be minimized. Recent research by the authors has revealed that
   coupling the vibration modes of passively-isolated machines by properly
   selecting the location of the vibration isolators could lead to a
   drastic reduction in residual vibrations. However, the effect of motor
   location on the residual vibrations of mode-coupled UPM machines has not
   been rigorously analyzed. In this paper, an objective function which
   minimizes residual vibration energy with respect to motor location is
   defined and analyzed. It is shown to have a guaranteed global minimum
   irrespective of the parameters of the UPM machine. Conditions that
   ensure that the global minimum is located in a practically feasible
   design space are explored. Finally, the merits of optimal motor
   placement on residual vibration reduction are demonstrated using
   simulations conducted on a 5-axis ultra-precision machine tool.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the vibratory response of structures with complex geometry
   can be challenging especially when their properties (geometry and
   material properties) are not known accurately. These structures can
   suffer also from high modal density, which can result in small changes
   in structural properties creating large changes in the resonant
   response. To address this issue, structural properties could be
   accurately identified, or the structural response could be
   experimentally measured. Both these approaches require collecting
   measurements of higher order vibration modes which have complicated
   shape. Consequently, high-accuracy positioning of laser beams is
   necessary for vibrometers based on laser Doppler velocimetry. This paper
   presents a methodology to address this challenge. The architecture
   involves a single-point vibrometer, a motion controller,
   translating/rotating stages, and special application software for
   alignment and edge detection. A key novelty of this technology is that
   the beam of the vibrometer is used for both detecting the edges and for
   measuring the vibration. Using a motion controller; the system can
   automatically place/scan and measure the surface of the structure with a
   positioning resolution of I gm. Experimental results are provided to
   demonstrate the new technique.}},

Abstract = {{In lean manufacturing, milk run (MR) systems represent route-based,
   cyclic material-handling systems that are used widely to enable frequent
   and consistent deliveries of containerised parts on an as-needed basis
   from a central storage area (the `supermarket') to multiple line-side
   deposit points on the factory floor. MR systems generally result in
   short lead times, low variability, and low line-side inventory levels.
   In the first part of this two-part paper, a basic, single-tugger MR
   system is described. Stability conditions are derived with respect to
   the `physical capacity' of the tugger, and the `time utilisation' of the
   driver/material handler, both of which are key criteria since the number
   of containers that can be delivered during each MR is limited, and each
   MR targets a prescribed cycle time to ensure timely and consistent
   deliveries. We also derive the distribution of the number of containers
   requested per MR, which allows the model to estimate the probability of
   exceeding the physical capacity of the tugger or the prescribed cycle
   time, under the assumption that sufficient kanban are available for each
   part type delivered by the MR system. The results of the study
   facilitate the design and analysis of MR systems used in industry.}},

   designing a MR system that will support workstations in a manufacturing
   plant. The performance of the analytic approximation is evaluated by
   simulating various MR systems. Our results suggest that, in a stable MR

Pages = {{62-68}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel heat transfer element for modeling the 3D
   thermal response in plates and shells exposed to non-uniform heating.
   The formulation uses a combination of finite element and control volume
   techniques to discretize the governing equations into a series of 2D
   layers that are linked by a finite difference calculation. While a
   combination of techniques are used in the element formulation, the
   governing element equations are in a form that can readily be
   implemented into a commercial finite element code. The nine-node
   quadratic element considered here is implemented in ABAQUS as a
   user-defined element. Two- and three-dimensional verification cases are
   presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the element. Comparisons
   between the proposed shell heat transfer element and traditional
   continuum elements demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits a high
   level of accuracy and requires minimal computational power. The layered
   formulation offers the additional advantage of simplifying the transfer
   of temperature data from a thermal analysis to a structural analysis
   because both models can have the same mesh. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{7-20}},

Abstract = {{Conventional wireless broadcast protocols rely heavily on the
   802.11-based CSMA/CA model, which avoids interference and collision by
   conservative scheduling of transmissions. While CSMA/CA is amenable to
   multiple concurrent unicasts, it tends to degrade broadcast performance
   significantly, especially in lossy and large-scale networks. In this
   paper, we propose a new protocol called Chorus that improves the
   efficiency and scalability of broadcast service with a MAC/PHY layer
   that allows packet collisions. Chorus is built upon the observation that
   packets carrying the same data can be effectively detected and decoded,
   even when they overlap with each other and have comparable signal
   strengths. It resolves collision using symbol-level interference
   cancellation, and then combines the resolved symbols to restore the
   packet. Such a collision-tolerant mechanism significantly improves the
   transmission diversity and spatial reuse in wireless broadcast. Chorus'
   MAC-layer cognitive sensing and scheduling scheme further facilitates
   the realization of such an advantage, resulting in an asymptotic
   broadcast delay that is proportional to the network radius. We evaluate
   Chorus' PHY-layer collision resolution mechanism with symbol-level
   simulation, and validate its network-level performance via ns-2, in
   comparison with a typical CSMA/CA-based broadcast protocol. Our
   evaluation validates Chorus's superior performance with respect to
   scalability, reliability, delay, etc., under a broad range of network
   scenarios (e.g., single/multiple broadcast sessions, static/mobile
   topologies).}},

Abstract = {{High-speed gas sampling experiments to measure the intermediate products
   formed during fuel decomposition remain challenging yet important
   experimental objectives. This article presents new speciation data on
   two important fuel reference compounds, n-heptane and n-butanol, at
   practical thermodynamic conditions of 700 K and 9 atm, for
   stoichiometric fuel-to-oxygen ratios and a dilution of 5.64 (molar ratio
   of inert gases to O-2), and at two blend ratios, 80\% 20\% and 50\%-50\%
   by mole of n-heptane and n-butanol, respectively. When compared against
   100\% n-heptane ignition results, the experimental data show that
   n-butanol slows the reactivity of n-heptane. In addition, speciation
   results of n-butanol concentrations show that n-heptane causes n-butanol
   to react at temperatures where n-butanol in isolation would not be
   considered reactive. The chemical kinetic mechanism developed for this
   work accurately predicts the trends observed for species such as carbon
   monoxide, methane, propane, 1-butene, and others. However, the mechanism
   predicts a higher amount of n-heptane consumed at the first stage of
   ignition compared to the experimental data. Consequently, many of the
   species concentration predictions show a sharp rise at the first stage
   of ignition, a trend that is not observed experimentally. An important
   discovery is that the presence of n-butanol reduces the measured
   concentrations of the large linear alkenes, including heptenes, hexenes,
   and pentenes, showing that the addition of n-butanol affects the
   fundamental chemical pathways of n-heptane during ignition.}},

Abstract = {{A host of observations demonstrating the relationship between nuclear
   architecture and processes such as gene expression have led to a number
   of new technologies for interrogating chromosome positioning. Whereas
   some of these technologies reconstruct intermolecular interactions,
   others have enhanced our ability to visualize chromosomes in situ. Here,
   we describe an oligonucleotide- and PCR-based strategy for fluorescence
   in situ hybridization (FISH) and a bioinformatic platform that enables
   this technology to be extended to any organism whose genome has been
   sequenced. The oligonucleotide probes are renewable, highly efficient,
   and able to robustly label chromosomes in cell culture, fixed tissues,
   and metaphase spreads. Our method gives researchers precise control over
   the sequences they target and allows for single and multicolor imaging
   of regions ranging from tens of kilobases to megabases with the same
   basic protocol. We anticipate this technology will lead to an enhanced
   ability to visualize interphase and metaphase chromosomes.}},

Abstract = {{A new diepoxide monomer (ADTDE) containing an allylic dithioether moiety
   has been synthesized to extend the suite of monomers that form networks
   exhibiting radical-mediated photoplasticity. These cross-linked polymers
   show permanent shape change under load and stress relax only when under
   the stimulus of visible or UV radiation. The Lewis base-catalyzed
   reaction of the epoxide groups in ADTDE with tri- and tetrafunctional
   thiols was monitored by differential scanning calorimetry and infrared
   spectroscopy. These curing systems were found to be more efficient than
   anionic, cationic, or anhydride polymerizations. The dynamic mechanical
   thermal analysis of ADTDE with the tetrathiol showed that the network
   was rubbery at room temperature which is considered ideal for the
   demonstration of photoplasticity. The photoinduced creep behavior was
   shown to be controlled by the presence of active free radicals in the
   matrix-on cessation of irradiation, the creep was terminated. The stress
   relaxation of the stretched network specimens during UV irradiation was
   studied and was found to be similar to that shown previously for
   thiol-vinyl ether networks. As expected, the cross-link density of
   networks prepared from ADTDE with the trithiol was lower than that
   formed with the tetrathiol and this was found to have a significant
   influence on the rate and extent of photoplasticity observed-the less
   highly cross-linked ADTDE/trithiol system exhibited more rapid and more
   extensive photoplasticity since it contained fewer network strands.}},

Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{This work presents dynamic scaling relations for the fluid-structure
   interaction (FSI) response and energy harvesting potential of fluttering
   piezoelectric beams. The results show that it is difficult to find a
   model-sized material to satisfy all the scaling relations using Reynolds
   scaling. Mach scaling, which does not imply that flow compressibility is
   important, but simply requires the same inflow speed and operating
   fluid, allows the same material as full-scale to be used; this enables
   the model to emulate similar FSI response, energy harvesting potential,
   and material failure mechanisms, if both the model and full-scale
   operate at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers (>= 1000). (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Detection of illicit trafficking of nuclear material relies on the
   detection of the radiation emitted. In the case of plutonium, one of the
   characteristic signatures derives from neutron emission. For this
   reason, neutron detectors cover an important role in detection systems.
   Most current neutron detection systems used for nuclear security are
   based on the He-3 technology. Unfortunately, in the last few years the
   market of He-3 has encountered huge problems in matching the supply and
   the demand. The need has grown significantly due to the increasing
   demand of instrumentation for security. This has caused an exponential
   increase of the price from one side and on the other side a serious
   strategic problem of resources.
   In order to guarantee the availability of detection systems for nuclear
   security, it is necessary to develop alternative detection systems based
   on technologies different from He-3. Many research projects have been
   devoted for the development of novel neutron detectors both by research
   organisations and by industries.
   Scientists from the PERLA laboratory of the Joint Research Centre (JRC)
   in Ispra, Italy, and their collaborators have tested several of these
   novel concepts in the last couple of years. This paper describes the
   detector systems tested at JRC and preliminary results on detectors that
   can be considered as promising alternatives to He-3. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Cluster pinch-point densities in polygons}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{50}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{In a statistical cluster or loop model such as percolation, or more
   generally the Potts models or O(n) models, a pinch point is a single
   bulk point where several distinct clusters or loops touch. In a polygon
   P harboring such a model in its interior and with 2N sides exhibiting
   free/fixed side-alternating boundary conditions, boundary clusters
   anchor to the fixed sides of P. At the critical point and in the
   continuum limit, the density (i.e. frequency of occurrence) of
   pinch-points between s distinct boundary clusters at a bulk point w is
   an element of P is proportional to
   <psi(c)(1)(w(1))psi(c)(1)(w(2)) ... psi(c)(1)(w(2N-1))
   psi(c)(1)(w(2N))Psi(s)(w, (w) over bar)>(P).
   The w(i) are the vertices of P, psi(c)(1) is a conformal field theory
   (CFT) corner one-leg operator, and Psi(s) is a CFT bulk 2s-leg operator.
   In this paper, we use the Coulomb gas formalism to construct explicit
   contour integral formulas for these correlation functions and thereby
   calculate the density of various pinch-point configurations at arbitrary
   points in the rectangle, in the hexagon, and for the case s = N, in the
   2N-sided polygon at the system's critical point. Explicit formulas for
   these results are given in terms of algebraic functions or integrals of
   algebraic functions, particularly Lauricella functions. In critical
   percolation, the result for s = N = 2 gives the density of red bonds
   between boundary clusters (in the continuum limit) inside a rectangle.
   We compare our results with high-precision simulations of critical
   percolation and Ising FK clusters in a rectangle of aspect ratio two and
   in a regular hexagon, and we find very good agreement.}},

Title = {{Carbon-Nanotube Optoacoustic Lens for Focused Ultrasound Generation and
   High-Precision Targeted Therapy}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate a new optical approach to generate high-frequency (>15
   MHz) and high-amplitude focused ultrasound, which can be used for
   non-invasive ultrasound therapy. A nano-composite film of carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) and elastomeric polymer is formed on concave lenses,
   and used as an efficient optoacoustic source due to the high optical
   absorption of the CNTs and rapid heat transfer to the polymer upon
   excitation by pulsed laser irradiation. The CNT-coated lenses can
   generate unprecedented optoacoustic pressures of >50 MPa in peak
   positive on a tight focal spot of 75 mm in lateral and 400 mm in axial
   widths. This pressure amplitude is remarkably high in this frequency
   regime, producing pronounced shock effects and non-thermal pulsed
   cavitation at the focal zone. We demonstrate that the optoacoustic lens
   can be used for micro-scale ultrasonic fragmentation of solid materials
   and a single-cell surgery in terms of removing the cells from substrates
   and neighboring cells.}},

Abstract = {{Arrays of semiconductor quantum dots grown by selective area epitaxy, a
   process in which the size and position of the dots is determined by a
   lithographically patterned mask, can have a high degree of uniformity in
   both size and position. However, non-uniformity in the initial stages of
   growth causes broadening of the energy states of GaN/InGaN
   heterostructures grown using this technique, limiting their practical
   utility for device applications. A phase-field model was developed to
   simulate selective area epitaxy, accounting for a
   crystallographic-orientation-dependent deposition rate. Model parameters
   were varied to optimize the uniformity of the InGaN active layers.
   Conditions that led to the most uniform active layers included low total
   deposition rate, high surface diffusivity, low deposition of surface
   adatoms from the mask, and smaller contact angle at the
   mask-vapor-quantum dot interface. Other factors that improved uniformity
   were growth on (0001) substrates, which is the fastest growth direction,
   and more vertical orientation of the sidewalls of the mask holes. (C)

Abstract = {{This study is the first to demonstrate that macrophage migration
   inhibitory factor (MIF), an immune system `inflammatory' cytokine that
   is released by the developing otocyst, plays a role in regulating early
   innervation of the mouse and chick inner ear. We demonstrate that MIF is
   a major bioactive component of the previously uncharacterized
   otocyst-derived factor, which directs initial neurite outgrowth from the
   statoacoustic ganglion (SAG) to the developing inner ear. Recombinant
   MIF acts as a neurotrophin in promoting both SAG directional neurite
   outgrowth and neuronal survival and is expressed in both the developing
   and mature inner ear of chick and mouse. A MIF receptor, CD74, is found
   on both embryonic SAG neurons and adult mouse spiral ganglion neurons.
   Mif knockout mice are hearing impaired and demonstrate altered
   innervation to the organ of Corti, as well as fewer sensory hair cells.
   Furthermore, mouse embryonic stem cells become neuron-like when exposed
   to picomolar levels of MIF, suggesting the general importance of this
   cytokine in neural development.}},

Abstract = {{Let MCM(m, n) and MWM(m. n. N) be the complexities of computing a
   maximum cardinality matching and a maximum weight matching, and let
   MCMbi, MWMbi be their counterparts for bipartite graphs, where m, n, and
   N are the edge count, vertex count, and maximum integer edge weight.
   Kao, Lam, Sung, and Ting (2001) {[}1] gave a general reduction showing
   MWMbi(m, n, N) = 0(N . MCMbi(m, n)) and Huang and Kavitha (2012) {[}2]
   recently proved the analogous result for general graphs, that MWM(m. n,
   N) = 0(N . MCM(m,n)).
   We show that Gabow's MWMbi and MWM algorithms from 1983 {[}3] and 1985
   {[}4] can be modified to replicate the results of Kao et al. and Huang
   and Kavitha, but with dramatically simpler proofs. We also show that our
   reduction leads to new bounds on the complexity of MWM on sparse graph
   classes, e.g., (bipartite) planar graphs, bounded genus graphs, and
   H-minor-free graphs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{We give a conditional derivation of the inhomogeneous critical
   percolation manifold of the bow-tie lattice with five different
   probabilities, a problem that does not appear at first to fall into any
   known solvable class. Although our argument is mathematically rigorous
   only on a region of the manifold, we conjecture that the formula is
   correct over its entire domain, and we provide a non-rigorous argument
   for this that employs the negative probability regime of the triangular
   lattice critical surface. We discuss how the rigorous portion of our
   result substantially broadens the range of lattices in the solvable
   class to include certain inhomogeneous and asymmetric bow-tie lattices,
   and that, if it could be put on a firm foundation, the negative
   probability portion of our method would extend this class to many
   further systems, including F Y Wu's checkerboard formula for the square
   lattice. We conclude by showing that this latter problem can in fact be
   proved using a recent result of Grimmett and Manolescu for isoradial
   graphs, lending strong evidence in favor of our other conjectured
   results.}},

Title = {{Neutron-induced U-235 fission spectrum measurements using liquid organic
   scintillation detectors}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Measurements have been performed at Los Alamos Neutron Science Center to
   acquire neutron fission spectra of U-235 in the energy range between 0.5
   and 10 MeV. These new data complement the currently available
   experimental data, which are not well known in the energy range below 1
   and above 5 MeV. Organic liquid scintillation detectors (EJ-309s) were
   used together with a digital data-acquisition system. The EJ-309
   detectors show excellent pulse shape discrimination capabilities and
   this is vital for identifying only neutron pulses and rejecting
   gamma-ray pulses. The measurement data show the dependence of average
   fission neutron energy as a function of the inducing neutron energy. The
   data agree well with previously published measurements and Watt spectra
   fits for energies up to tens of MeV. At high fission-inducing neutron
   energies the spectrum deviates from Watt-spectra fits. The increased
   energy deposited in higher energy neutron-induced fissions does not
   significantly increase emitted fission neutron energies for up to 10
   MeV. A significant decrease in neutron energy around second-chance
   fission cannot be observed beyond the current measurement uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Using Brownian dynamics simulations of polymer chains over a wide range
   of resolution, we find universal scaling laws for polymer coil
   dimensions and tumbling time. At high shear rates (gamma) over dot, the
   coil thickness in the gradient direction becomes independent of chain
   length, scaling as N-kappa(0)(gamma) over dot(-1/4), where N-kappa
   denotes the numbers of Kuhn steps, and the tumbling time scales as
   N-kappa(gamma) over dot(-3/4), correcting scaling laws presented in
   prior studies. We find this to be a consequence of the formation of
   loops whose length is limited by the time required to stretch them and
   derive scaling laws from a balance of convection and diffusion of
   monomers. We find that, in the absence of hydrodynamic interaction (HI)
   and excluded volume (EV), for wormlike chains, the shrinkage in chain
   stretch observed at ultrahigh shear rates is pushed out to arbitrarily
   high shear rates if the chain is resolved increasingly finely below the
   persistence length. Finally, scaling laws in the presence of excluded
   volume and hydrodynamic interactions are derived that are expected to be
   valid for long chains at high shear rates.}},

Title = {{Root niche separation can explain avoidance of seasonal drought stress
   and vulnerability of overstory trees to extended drought in a mature
   Amazonian forest}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Large areas of Amazonian evergreen forest experience seasonal droughts
   extending for three or more months, yet show maximum rates of
   photosynthesis and evapotranspiration during dry intervals. This
   apparent resilience is belied by disproportionate mortality of the large
   trees in manipulations that reduce wet season rainfall, occurring after
   2-3 years of treatment. The goal of this study is to characterize the
   mechanisms that produce these contrasting ecosystem responses. A
   mechanistic model is developed based on the ecohydrological framework of
   TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network)-based Real Time Integrated Basin
   Simulator + Vegetation Generator for Interactive Evolution
   (tRIBS+VEGGIE). The model is used to test the roles of deep roots and
   soil capillary flux to provide water to the forest during the dry
   season. Also examined is the importance of ``root niche separation,{''}
   in which roots of overstory trees extend to depth, where during the dry
   season they use water stored from wet season precipitation, while roots
   of understory trees are concentrated in shallow layers that access dry
   season precipitation directly. Observational data from the Tapajo's
   National Forest, Brazil, were used as meteorological forcing and
   provided comprehensive observational constraints on the model. Results
   strongly suggest that deep roots with root niche separation adaptations
   explain both the observed resilience during seasonal drought and the
   vulnerability of canopy-dominant trees to extended deficits of wet
   season rainfall. These mechanisms appear to provide an adaptive strategy
   that enhances productivity of the largest trees in the face of their
   disproportionate heat loads and water demand in the dry season. A
   sensitivity analysis exploring how wet season rainfall affects the
   stability of the rainforest system is presented. Citation: Ivanov, V.

Abstract = {{Multicellular spheroids are three dimensional in vitro microscale tissue
   analogs. The current article examines the suitability of spheroids as an
   in vitro platform for testing drug delivery systems. Spheroids model
   critical physiologic parameters present in vivo, including complex
   multicellular architecture, barriers to mass transport, and
   extracellular matrix deposition. Relative to two-dimensional cultures,
   spheroids also provide better target cells for drug testing and are
   appropriate in vitro models for studies of drug penetration. Key
   challenges associated with creation of uniformly sized spheroids,
   spheroids with small number of cells and co-culture spheroids are
   emphasized in the article. Moreover, the assay techniques required for
   the characterization of drug delivery and efficacy in spheroids and the
   challenges associated with such studies are discussed. Examples for the
   use of spheroids in drug delivery and testing are also emphasized. By
   addressing these challenges with possible solutions, multicellular
   spheroids are becoming an increasingly useful in vitro tool for drug
   screening and delivery to pathological tissues and organs. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Antibodies are under development to treat a variety of cancers, such as
   lymphomas, colon, and breast cancer. A major limitation to greater
   efficacy for this class of drugs is poor distribution in vivo.
   Localization of antibodies occurs slowly, often in insufficient
   therapeutic amounts, and distributes heterogeneously throughout the
   tumor. While the microdistribution around individual vessels is
   important for many therapies, the total amount of antibody localized in
   the tumor is paramount for many applications such as imaging,
   determining the therapeutic index with antibody drug conjugates, and
   dosing in radioimmunotherapy. With imaging and pretargeted therapeutic
   strategies, the time course of uptake is critical in determining when to
   take an image or deliver a secondary reagent. We present here a simple
   mechanistic model of antibody uptake and retention that captures the
   major rates that determine the time course of antibody concentration
   within a tumor including dose, affinity, plasma clearance, target
   expression, internalization, permeability, and vascularization. Since
   many of the parameters are known or can be estimated in vitro, this
   model can approximate the time course of antibody concentration in
   tumors to aid in experimental design, data interpretation, and
   strategies to improve localization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) forests may be used as
   miniature springs, compliant thermal interfaces, and shock absorbers,
   and for these and other applications it is vital to understand how to
   engineer their mechanical properties. Herein is investigated how the
   diameter and packing density within CNT forests govern their deformation
   behavior, structural stiffness, and elastic energy absorption
   properties. The mechanical behavior of low-density CNT forests grown by
   fixed catalyst CVD methods and high-density CNT forests grown by a
   floating catalyst CVD method are studied by in situ SEM compression
   testing and tribometer measurements of force-displacement relationships.
   Low-density and small-diameter CNT columns (fixed catalyst) exhibit
   large plastic deformation and can be pre-deformed to act as springs
   within a specified elastic range, whereas high-density and
   large-diameter CNT columns (floating catalyst) exhibit significant
   elastic recovery after deformation. In this work the energy absorption
   capacity of CNT forests is tuned over three orders of magnitude and it
   is shown that CNT forest density can be tuned over a range of
   conventional foam materials, but corresponding stiffness is similar to
   10x higher. It is proposed that the elastic behavior of CNT forests is
   analogous to open-cell foams and a simple model is presented. It is also
   shown that this model can be useful as a first-order design tool to
   establish design guidelines for the mechanical properties of CNT forests
   and selection of the appropriate synthesis method.}},

Abstract = {{The compression response of 3D woven textile composites (3DWC) that
   consist of glass fiber tows and a polymer matrix material is studied
   using a combination of experiments and finite element based analyses. A
   previous study reported by the authors consisted of an experimental
   investigation of 3DWC under high strain rate loading, Pankow, Salvi,
   Waas, Yen, and Ghiorse (2011). Those experimental results were explained
   by using the finite element method to analyze the high rate deformation
   response of representative volume elements (RVEs) of the 3DWC, Pankow,
   Waas, Yen, and Ghiorse (2012). In this paper, the same modeling strategy
   is used to examine the quasi-static, compressive deformation response of
   3DWC. The effect of using different numbers of the textile repeat unit
   architecture in the RYE, on the predicted compression strength, is
   examined. The transitions in failure modes that are seen in experiments
   are seen to be captured by the model that is presented here.}},

Abstract = {{An agent, consisting of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying
   strapped-down sensors, is to examine a number of unidentified objects
   within a given search area, collect information, and utilize that
   information to classify the objects. The problem is challenging because
   the mission time is often limited, the agent is only provided with
   partial a priori information, and the amount of information that the
   sensor can measure is dependent on the relative position of the agent
   with respect to the object. Our technical approach is three-fold. First,
   we model the motion of the agent using a kinematic model with constant
   altitude. Second, we use a performance prediction model that gives the
   probability of target discrimination as a function of the range from the
   sensor to the object. Third, a linear classifier that utilizes Bayes'
   theorem diagnoses the status of the objects of interestwhile an
   information-theoretic measure is used to quantify the uncertainty in
   classification. We pose an optimal control problem that minimizes the
   classification uncertainty while taking differential constraints and the
   time history of the agent's steering decisions as the control input. We
   investigate whether maximizing information by choosing informative paths
   always minimizes the classification uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{The development of cementless slag-based alkali-activated mortar has
   previously been demonstrated. While greener than Portland cement based
   compositions, slag-based alkali-activated mortar tends to be highly
   brittle. In the present work, the feasibility of developing a new
   strain-hardening fiber reinforced composite using slag-based
   alkali-activated mortar reinforced by polyvinyl alcohol fiber is
   presented. In the development, three mixtures having a viscosity range
   that promotes uniform fiber dispersion were determined according to the
   types of alkali-activator and water to binder ratio. A series of
   experiments, including density, compression, uniaxial tension and panel
   bending tests were carried out to characterize the mechanical properties
   of the composite. Test results establish the feasibility of attaining
   tensile strain up to 4.7\% in fiber reinforced alkali-activated slag
   composite, compared with 0.020\% for the mortar matrix alone. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This article presents a summary of passive, semipassive, semiactive, and
   active control methods for schemes using harvested energy as the main
   source of energy to suppress vibrations via piezoelectric materials.
   This concept grew out of the fact that energy dissipation effects
   resulting from energy harvesting can cause structural damping. First,
   the existing equivalent electromechanical modeling methods are reviewed
   for vibration-based energy harvesters using piezoelectric transducers.
   Modeling of base excitation cantilever beam ranges from lumped to
   distributed parameter formulations. The commonly used electrical power
   conditioning circuits and their optimization are also summarized and
   discussed. The energy dissipation from harvesting induces structural
   damping, and this leads to the concept of purely passive shunt damping.
   This article reviews the literature on vibration control laws along the
   lines of purely passive, semipassive, semiactive, and active control.
   The classification of pervious results is built on whether external
   power is supplied to the piezoelectric transducers. The focus is placed
   on recent articles investigating semipassive and semiactive control
   strategies derived from synchronized switching damping. However, whether
   or not the harvested energy is large enough to satisfy a vibration
   suppression requirement has become an important topic of research but
   has not yet specifically been addressed in previous studies. Hence, this
   survey also reviews the possible control methods aiming for less control
   energy consumption and addresses the potential application for
   simultaneous vibration control and energy harvesting.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the use of actively controlled electronics to
   maximize the energy harvested from a stationary stochastic disturbance.
   In prior work by the authors, it has been shown that when the harvester
   dynamics are linear and the transmission losses in the electronics are
   resistive, the optimal feedback controller is the solution to a
   nonstandard linear-quadratic-Gaussian optimal control problem. This
   article augments the theory in the following three distinct ways: (a) It
   illustrates how to use linear matrix inequalities to balance the
   objective of energy harvesting against other response control objectives
   (such as minimum requirements on closed-loop damping and maximum levels
   of voltage response), in the synthesis of the optimal feedback law; (b)
   it establishes a more realistic characterization of the transmission
   losses in the actively controlled power electronics used to regulate the
   extraction of power; and (c) it illustrates how the optimal control
   theory for resistive loss models can be extended to accommodate the more
   realistic loss models. The theory is illustrated in the context of a
   piezoelectric energy harvesting model, and an example is used to
   illustrate that the theory can be used to simultaneously optimize the
   feedback law, together with the switching frequency and storage bus
   voltage of the power electronics.}},

Abstract = {{In order to predict bioeffects in contrast-enhanced diagnostic and
   therapeutic ultrasound procedures, the dynamics of cavitation
   microbubbles in viscoelastic media must be determined. For this
   theoretical study, measured 1.5 to 7.5MHz pulse pressure waveforms,
   which were used in experimental determinations of capillary breaching
   thresholds for contrast-enhanced diagnostic ultrasound in a rat kidney,
   were used to calculate cavitation nucleated from contrast agent
   microbubbles. A numerical model for cavitation in tissue was developed
   based on the Keller-Miksis equation (a compressible extension of the
   Rayleigh-Plesset equation for spherical bubble dynamics), with a
   Kelvin-Voigt constitutive relation. From this model, the bubble dynamics
   corresponding to the experimentally obtained capillary breaching
   thresholds were determined. Values of the maximum radius and temperature
   corresponding to previously determined bioeffect thresholds were
   computed for a range of ultrasound pulses and bubble sizes for
   comparison to inertial cavitation threshold criteria. The results were
   dependent on frequency, the gas contents, and the tissue elastic
   properties. The bioeffects thresholds were above previously determined
   inertial cavitation thresholds, even for the tissue models, suggesting
   the possibility of a more complex dosimetry for capillary injury in
   tissue. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{A novel methodology to detect the presence of a crack and to predict the
   nonlinear forced response of mistuned turbine engine rotors with a
   cracked blade and mistuning is developed. The combined effects of the
   crack and mistuning are modeled. First, a hybrid-interface method based
   on component mode synthesis is employed to develop reduced-order models
   (ROMs) of the tuned system with a cracked blade. Constraint modes are
   added to model the displacements due to the intermittent contact between
   the crack surfaces. The degrees of freedom (DOFs) on the crack surfaces
   are retained as active DOFs so that the physical forces due to the
   contact/interaction (in the three-dimensional space) can be accurately
   modeled. Next, the presence of mistuning in the tuned system with a
   cracked blade is modeled. Component mode mistuning is used to account
   for mistuning present in the uncracked blades while the cracked blade is
   considered as a reference (with no mistuning). Next, the resulting
   (reduced-order) nonlinear equations of motion are solved by applying an
   alternating frequency/time-domain method. Using these efficient ROMs in
   a forced response analysis, it is found that the new modeling approach
   provides significant computational cost savings, while ensuring good
   accuracy relative to full-order finite element analyses. Furthermore,
   the effects of the cracked blade on the mistuned system are investigated
   and used to detect statistically the presence of a crack and to identify
   which blade of a full bladed disk is cracked. In particular, it is shown
   that cracks can be distinguished from mistuning. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper investigates brake-based path control of a passenger vehicle,
   aimed at reducing secondary collision risk, following an initial impact
   in a traffic accident. This risk may be reduced if lateral deviations
   from the preimpact path can be minimized, at least on straight roads.
   Numerical optimization has previously shown that coupled control of
   lateral forces and yaw moments can be applied to effectively minimize
   such path deviations. In this paper, a quasi-linear optimal controller
   (QLOC) is proposed to achieve this control target. QLOC uses nonlinear
   optimal control theory to provide a semiexplicit approximation for
   optimal post impact (PI) path control. The controller design method is
   novel, combining linear costate dynamics with nonlinear constraints due
   to tire friction limits. A fully closed-loop form of the controller is
   presented; it is applicable to multiple-event accidents occurring on
   straight roads, including adaptive estimation of the time instant at
   maximum deviation. The controller achieves performance that is very
   similar to that of open-loop numerical optimization. Assuming that the
   vehicle remains on the road surface after the impact and that the brake
   actuators remain operational, it is verified that the path controller is
   effective over a wide range of PI kinematic conditions. It is expected
   that the QLOC controller will prove useful in other cases where chassis
   systems directly control the vehicle path, e.g., in crash-imminent
   avoidance maneuvers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a computational model of driver lateral
   control based on the queuing network cognitive architecture and the
   driver preview model about driver lateral control activities. This
   computational model was applied to model the dual tasks of driving with
   a cognitive distraction task. The comparison between human driver data
   and model simulation data shows that this computational model can
   perform vehicle lateral control well, and its performance is consistent
   with that of drivers under single- and dual-task driving conditions.
   Furthermore, we examine the effectiveness of some parameters of the
   model in representing different styles of driving and discuss the value
   of this computational model in facilitating the evaluation of vehicle
   dynamics and driver assistant systems and providing new insights into
   research on unmanned vehicle control techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Dominant frequencies (DFs) of activation are higher in the
   atria of patients with persistent than paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
   (AF), and left atrial (LA)-to-right atrial (RA) DF gradients have been
   identified in both. However, whether such gradients are maintained as
   long-term persistent AF is established remains unexplored. We aimed at
   determining in vivo the time course in atrial DF values from paroxysmal
   to persistent AF in sheep and testing the hypothesis that an LA-to-RA DF
   difference is associated with LA drivers in persistent AF.
   Methods and Results-AF was induced using RA tachypacing (n=8).
   Electrograms were obtained weekly from an RA lead and an implantable
   loop recorder implanted near the LA. DFs were determined for
   5-second-long electrograms (QRST subtracted) during AF in vivo and in ex
   vivo optical mapping. Underlying structural changes were compared with
   weight-matched controls (n=4). After the first AF episode, DF increased
   gradually during a 2-week period (7 +/- 0.21 to 9.92 +/- 0.31 Hz; n=6;
   P<0.05). During 9 to 24 weeks of AF, the DF values on the implantable
   loop recorder were higher than the RA (10.6 +/- 0.08 versus 9.3 +/- 0.1
   Hz, respectively; n=7; P<0.0001). Subsequent optical mapping confirmed a
   DF gradient from posterior LA-to-RA (9.1 +/- 1.0 to 6.9 +/- 0.9 Hz;
   P<0.05) and demonstrated patterns of activation compatible with drifting
   rotors in the posterior LA. Persistent AF sheep showed significant
   enlargement of the posterior LA compared with controls.
   Conclusions-In the sheep, transition from paroxysmal to persistent AF
   shows continuous LA-to-RA DF gradients in vivo together with enlargement
   of the posterior LA, which harbors the highest frequency domains and
   patterns of activation compatible with drifting rotors. (Circ Arrhythm

Title = {{Dynamic Nanoparticle Assemblies}},

Abstract = {{Although nanoparticle (NP) assemblies are at the beginning of their
   development, their unique geometrical shapes and media-responsive
   optical, electronic, and magnetic properties have attracted significant
   interest. Nanoscale assembly bridges multiple levels of hierarchy of
   materials: dual nanoparticles, discrete molecule-like or virus-like
   nanoscale agglomerates, microscale devices, and macroscale materials.
   The capacity to self-assemble on greatly facilitate the integration of
   nanotechnology with other technologies and, in particular, with
   microscale fabrication. In this Account, we describe developments in the
   emerging field of dynamic NP assemblies, which are spontaneously form
   superstructures containing more than two inorganic nanoscale particles
   that display the ability to change their geometrical, physical,
   chemical, and other attributes. In many ways, dynamic assemblies ran
   represent a bottleneck in the ``bottom-up{''} fabrication of NP-based
   devices bemuse they can produce a much greater variety of assemblies,
   but they also provide a convenient tool for variation of geometries and
   dimensions of nanoparticle assemblies.
   Superstructures of NPs (and those held together by similar intrinsic
   forces)are classified into two groups: Class 1 where media and external
   fields can alter shape, conformation, and order of stable super
   structures with a nearly constant number of NPs or Class 2 where the
   total number of NPs changes, while the organizational motif in the final
   superstructure remains the same. The future development of successful
   dynamic assemblies requires understanding the equilibrium in dynamic NP
   systems. The dynamic nature of Class 1 assemblies is associated with the
   equilibrium between different conformations of a superstructure and is
   comparable to the isomerization in classical chemistry. Class 2
   assemblies involve the formation or breakage of linkages between the
   NPs, which is analogous to the classical chemical equilibrium for the
   formation of a molecule from atoms. Finer classification of NP
   assemblies in accord with established conventions in the field may
   include different size dimensionalities: discrete assemblies (artificial
   molecules) and one-dimensional (spaced chains), two-dimensional
   (sheets), and three-dimensional (superlattices, twisted structures)
   assemblies. Notably, these dimensional attributes must be regarded as
   primarily topological in nature because all of these superstructures can
   acquire complex three-dimensional shapes.
   We discuss three primary strategies used to prepare NP superstructures:
   (1) anisotropy-based assemblies utilizing either intrinsic force field
   anisotropy around NPs or external anisotropy associated with templates
   or applied fields, (2) assembly methods utilizing uniform NPs with
   isotropic interactions, and (3) methods based on mutual recognition of
   biomolecules, such as DNA and antigen antibody interactions.
   We consider optical, electronic, and magnetic properties of dynamic
   superstructures, focusing primarily on multiparticle effects in NP
   superstructures as represented by surface plasmon resonance, NP-NP
   charge transport, and multibody magnetization. Unique properties of NP
   superstructures are being applied to biosensing, drug delivery, and
   nanoelectronics. For both Class 1 and Class 2 dynamic assemblies,
   biosensing is the most dominant and well-developed area of dynamic
   nanostructures being successfully transitioned into practice. We can
   foresee the rapid development of dynamic NP assemblies toward
   applications in harvesting of dissipated energy, photonics, and
   electronics. The final part of this Account is devoted to the
   fundamental questions facing dynamic assemblies of NPs in the future.}},

Abstract = {{A series of atomic models of the Sigma 5(2 1 0)/{[}0 0 1] symmetric tilt
   grain boundary in yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) are constructed
   according to the coincident site lattice theory. Calculations performed
   using empirical potentials show that the O-termination configurations,
   namely G(1) and 0(2), are the most energetically favorable boundary
   structures. First-principles density functional theory calculations have
   been further performed to understand the atomic and electronic
   structures, effective charge, potential distributions and optical
   properties of G(1) and G(2) grain boundaries. The simulated
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images of G(1) and G(2)
   are generally in good agreement with the experimental micrographs of the
   Sigma 5(2 1 0)/{[}0 0 1] grain boundaries. Results show that the
   effective charges of the atoms in the grain boundary region are related
   to their coordination numbers and bonding lengths. Moreover, the overall
   total density of states of G(1) and G(2) has been found to have similar
   features with the bulk YAG, with the exception of some defect states
   being introduced at the top of the valence band, resulting in the
   reduction of the band gap. The calculated optical properties show that
   the refractive indices of both grain boundary models are slightly larger
   than those of the bulk YAG. This is in agreement with the experimental
   observation that the refractive index of the polycrystalline YAG is
   higher than that of its single crystalline counterpart. (C) 2012 Acta

Abstract = {{Economic, energy, and environmental impacts of 11 types of bioethanol
   feedstock in China were evaluated using a mixed-unit input-output life

   sugar beet, and sugarcane showed better economic performance but
   increasing negative energy and environmental impacts. Cellulose-based
   feedstocks in general showed positive economic, energy, and

   on freshwater use, global warming, toxicity, and aquatic ecotoxicity.
   Sugarcane-based bioethanol had the potential to provide positive
   economic, energy, and environmental impacts in China. Scrap

Abstract = {{The correlation between gaze strategy and kinematics of bimanual
   movements was assessed using repetitive bimanual object transfers as an
   experimental paradigm. The hypothesis was that visual demand in such
   tasks is a critical bottleneck in determining bimanual coordination.
   Kinematics and eye movements were compared before and after practice of
   this repetitive task. New eye-hand coordination strategies emerged with
   practice. Also, with practice a systematic prioritization of the left
   hand movement to be `primary' and the right hand movement to be
   `secondary' emerged. This choice implied that the left hand movement
   kinematics was similar to that of the unimanual left hand movements,
   whereas the performance of the right hand task was contingent on
   successful completion of the primary task. This was revealed by
   `anticipatory adjustments' of the right hand kinematics (right-hand peak
   velocity ranged from 100-70\% of the left-hand, and the scaling was
   dependent on task conditions and the corresponding eye-hand coordination
   strategies used). We used this evidence to argue that the CNS, aware of
   an inherent asymmetry between the two hand systems, learns to anticipate
   the need and availability of visual feedback for successful task
   completion, and uses this knowledge to optimize movement coordination,
   specifically such that the right-hand control was modulated to take
   visual constraints into account. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Air lubrication techniques for frictional drag reduction on ships have
   been proposed by numerous researchers since the 19th century. However,
   these techniques have not been widely adopted as questions persist about
   their drag reduction performance beyond the laboratory, as well as
   energy and economic cost-benefit. This paper draws on data from the
   literature to consider the suitability of air lubrication for large
   ocean going and U.S. Great Lakes ships, by establishing the basic energy
   economic calculations and presenting results for a hypothetical air
   lubricated ship. All the assumptions made in the course of the analysis
   are clearly stated so that they can be refined when considering
   application of air lubrication to a specific ship. The analysis suggests
   that, if successfully implemented, both air layer and partial cavity
   drag reduction could lead to net energy savings of 10 to 20\%, with
   corresponding reductions in emissions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Metglas (TM) 2826MB foils of 25-30 mu m thickness with the composition
   of Fe40Ni38Mo4B18 have been used for magnetoelastic sensors in various
   applications over many years. This work is directed at the investigation
   of similar to 3 mu m thick iron-nickel-molybdenum-boron (FeNiMoB) thin
   films that are intended for integrated microsystems. The films are
   deposited on Si substrate by co-sputtering of iron-nickel (FeNi),
   molybdenum (Mo), and boron (B) targets. The results show that dopants of
   Mo and B can significantly change the microstructure and magnetic
   properties of FeNi materials. When FeNi is doped with only Mo its
   crystal structure changes from polycrystalline to amorphous with the
   increase of dopant concentration; the transition point is found at about
   10 at. \% of Mo content. A significant change in anisotropic magnetic
   properties of FeNi is also observed as the Mo dopant level increases.
   The coercivity of FeNi films doped with Mo decreases to a value less
   than one third of the value without dopant. Doping the FeNi with B
   together with Mo considerably decreases the value of coercivity and the
   out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy properties, and it also greatly changes
   the microstructure of the material. In addition, doping B to FeNiMo
   remarkably reduces the remanence of the material. The film material that
   is fabricated using an optimized process is magnetically as soft as
   amorphous Metglas (TM) 2826MB with a coercivity of less than 40 Am-1.
   The findings of this study provide us a better understanding of the
   effects of the compositions and microstructure of FeNiMoB thin film
   materials on their magnetic properties. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Laser-induced fluorescence is employed for the accurate and real-time
   in-situ monitoring of the concentration of organic molecules in an
   organic vapor phase deposition (OVPD) chamber. We investigate the
   transport dynamics of organic species in a hot N-2 carrier gas from the
   evaporation source to the substrate. Based on the time-dependent
   concentration of organic molecules obtained from their fluorescence
   intensity near the substrate, we find that carrier gas transport is
   accurately described by Poiseuille flow. The interplay between
   convective and diffusive forces gives rise to dispersion of organic
   molecules in the carrier gas, resulting in the development of plug flow
   as described by Taylor-Aris theory. Retention of molecules in chamber
   dead volumes delays transport and introduces tailing of the
   concentration transients. Our study indicates how OVPD system design and
   operating conditions can be optimized to limit the duration of transport
   transients, ultimately leading to precise control over the growth of
   complex multilayer thin film structures. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Nano-scale zerovalent iron (nZVI) has been studied in recent years for
   environmental remediation applications such as the degradation of
   chlorinated organic contaminants. To overcome limitations related to the
   transport of nZVI, it is becoming common to add a polymer stabilizer to
   limit aggregation and enhance the particle reactivity. Another method
   investigated to enhance particle reactivity has been to limit particle
   size through novel synthesis techniques. However, the relative impacts
   of particle size and interactions of the chemicals with the coatings are
   not yet well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate
   the mechanisms of particle size and polymer coating or polyelectrolyte
   multilayer (PEM) synthesis conditions on degradation of two common
   chlorinated contaminants: trichloroethylene (TCE) and polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs). This was accomplished using two different synthesis
   techniques, a layer-by-layer approach at different pH values or iron
   reduction in the presence of varying concentrations of poly(acrylic
   acid). nZVI produced by both techniques yielded higher degradation rates
   than a traditional approach. The mechanistic investigation indicated
   that hydrophobicity and sorption to the multilayer impacts the
   availability of the hydrophobic compound to the nZVI and that particle
   size also had a large role with smaller particles having stronger
   dechlorination rates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The vibrational behavior of binary silicate glasses is modeled using
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The prevailing procedure for
   assigning vibrational modes to structural features is through comparison
   with spectra of known substances. The explicit knowledge of atomic
   trajectories from MD simulations allows for a direct observation of
   vibrational motion in specific frequency bands and decomposition into
   the predominant vibrational modes. We demonstrate a Fourier transform
   method for determining the vibrational motion associated with a
   particular frequency. We compare literature assignments for
   alpha-cristobalite, vitreous silica, beta Na2O-2SiO(2) and vitreous
   Na2O-2SiO(2) to this method. Our analysis shows that while it is
   necessary for the network to be disrupted and non-bridging oxygen atoms
   to form for vibrational motion to occur at 1205 cm(-1), the mode is in
   fact not specific to that structural moiety. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Abiotic degradation of cis-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride
   (VC) was investigated using Fe hydroxides obtained by hydrolyzing Fe(II)
   salts over a pH range of 7.7-8.0. Within this narrow pH range, a green
   rust (GR) precipitated. The dechlorination reactivity of the resulting
   GR precipitates increased with the dissolved Fe(II) concentration
   remaining in solution after precipitation. Controls run using only the
   dissolved Fe(II) supernatant were not reactive, suggesting the relative
   amount of Fe(II) on the surface of precipitated GRs was the causative
   agent in the relative reactivity. To test this, a series of GR batches
   with varying dissolved Fe(II) concentrations were prepared by acid-base
   titration and examined for cis-DCE and VC dechlorination kinetics under
   reducing conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of these batches were performed to
   characterize the bulk mineralogy and the excess surface Fe(II),
   respectively. Cis-DCE and VC dechlorination results along with solid
   phase characterization show that different surface Fe(II)/Fe(III)
   compositions are responsible for the different reactivity of GRs formed
   within the GR precipitation zone. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Single crystals of FePb4Sb6Se14, were obtained from solid-state
   combination of high purity elemental powders at 873K for three days.
   Single crystal X-ray structure determination revealed that the compound
   crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c (no. 14) and adopts the
   structure of Jamesonite (FePb4Sb6S14). The structure contains two
   crystallographically independent lead atoms with monocapped and bicapped
   trigonal prismatic coordinations, three antimony atoms located in a
   distorted octahedral environment and one iron atom occupying a flattened
   octahedral coordination. Neighboring monocapped and bicapped trigonal
   prims around lead atoms share faces and edges to build a corrugated
   layer parallel to the ac plane. Octahedrally coordinated antimony atoms
   share edges to form one-dimensional (1D) \{SbSe\}8 ribbons connecting
   adjacent corrugated layers. The distortion of the octahedral
   coordination around antimony atoms within the \{SbSe\}8 ribbons with the
   longest bond pointing towards the center of the ribbon, suggests the
   stereochemical activity of antimony lone-pairs with their electron
   clouds pointing towards the center of the \{SbSe\}8 ribbon. The three
   dimensional framework resulting from the connectivity between the
   corrugated layers and the \{SbSe\}8 ribbons, contains isolated
   cylindrical voids parallel to {[}100] which are filled by a 1D FenSe4n+2
   straight chain of edge-sharing FeSe6 octahedra. The crystal structure of
   FePb4Sb6Se14 is closely related to that of FePb3Sb4Se10 as they are
   formed by similar building units with different sizes.}},

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2655-2669}},

Abstract = {{Hypersonic flow computations have proved to be very troublesome due to
   the appearance of shock anomalies (instabilities and oscillations) such
   as carbuncle phenomenon. These anomalies are categorized into
   one-dimensional and multidimensional modes, and these modes both arise
   from many factors and their combinations. Accurate prediction of
   hypersonic heating, a key issue in hypersonic flow computations, is
   therefore challenging especially for three dimensions. In the present
   study, we focus on three-dimensional shock anomalies and heating
   motivated by the following reasons. 1) Intuitively, multidimensional
   shock anomalies are considered to develop more likely in three
   dimensions than in two dimensions, but it cannot be proved
   mathematically nor has it been numerically demonstrated; specifically,
   it is not clear yet whether the third dimension plays another role that
   is absent in two dimensions. 2) Most proposed remedies for
   multidimensional anomalies had been tested in one- or two-dimensional
   setups in the literature, but it is not guaranteed whether such
   multidimensional dissipations actually work well in three dimensions. 3)
   It is already known to be troublesome to extend some multidimensional
   methods developed in two dimensions to three dimensions. The numerical
   results show that three-dimensional anomalies are too complicated to be
   predicted from their two-dimensional counterparts and that they can
   either he partly removed or, even worse, enhanced by multidimensional
   dissipations. Therefore, robustness of a numerical method that worked
   well in two dimensions may not be preserved in three dimensions.}},

Journal = {{AIAA JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2809-2819}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In computational fluid dynamics, for problems with periodic flow
   solutions, the computational cost of spectral methods is significantly
   lower than that of full, unsteady computations. As is the case for
   regular steady-flow problems, there are various interesting periodic
   problems, such as those involving helicopter rotor blades, wind
   turbines, or oscillating wings, that can be analyzed with spectral
   methods. When conducting gradient-based numerical optimization for these
   types of problems, efficient sensitivity analysis is essential. The
   authors developed an accurate and efficient sensitivity analysis for
   time-spectral computational fluid dynamics. By combining the cost
   advantage of the spectral-solution methodology with an efficient
   gradient computation, the total cost of optimizing periodic unsteady
   problems can be significantly reduced. The efficient gradient
   computation takes the form of an automatic differentiation discrete
   adjoint method, which combines the efficiency of an adjoint method with
   the accuracy and rapid implementation of automatic differentiation. To
   demonstrate the method, the authors computed sensitivities for an
   oscillating ONERA M6 wing. The sensitivities are shown to be accurate to
   8-12 digits, and the computational cost of the adjoint computations is
   shown to scale well up to problems of more than 41 million state
   variables.}},

Abstract = {{The size and spatial distributions of islands in random fractal surfaces
   and natural islands are investigated. Multi-scale island distributions
   from a fractal surface are analyzed to determine the size distribution
   of islands, such as the number of islands greater than a particular
   size, and this was found to exhibit a Korcak-type empirical relation. In
   the same multi-scale analysis, the spatial distribution of islands,
   which is the number of islands less than or equal to a particular
   distance between a pair of islands, is also investigated to determine
   the effects of differences in scale. The spatial distribution of
   distance between uniformly distributed islands is analytically
   calculated and compared with the island distributions of the fractal
   surface. We seek to determine the degree of resemblance between
   simulated spatial distributions and the natural island distribution of
   French Polynesia. We also estimate the size and spatial distributions of
   islands according to different sea levels. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The novel architecture of wave-like proton exchange membrane fuel cell
   (PEMFC) stack developed in our previous work achieved peak volumetric
   power density and specific power of 2,715.9?W?L1 and 2,157.9?W?kg1,
   respectively. However, there still existed perforated bipolar plates and
   the carbon fiber gas diffusion layer (GDL) was easy to cause damage
   during the fabrication process of undulate membrane electrode assembles
   (MEAs). In the present study, sintered stainless steel fiber felt
   (SSSFF) was employed to work as metallic GDL (MGDL) and bipolar plates
   simultaneously. Compound membrane electrode assembles (CMEAs) with
   serpentine and interdigitated flow channels were designed and fabricated
   using stamping process. A single cell with CMEA was assembled in house
   and the output performance was evaluated systemically. The results
   indicated that the peak volumetric power density and specific power of
   wave-like PEMFC single with CMEA are 5,764.0?W?L1 and 4,693.5?W?kg1

   events. Improvements in the detector performance over time reflect the
   improvements in detector growth and fabrication over the past several
   years. In addition to the spectroscopic performance of the detectors,
   the imaging performance of each detector was also quantified. The
   results show that imaging is weakly correlated to the spectroscopic
   performance, and more strongly correlated to the accuracy of the depth
   reconstruction. Other detector issues such as gain deficit and gain
   variation are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial dispersion of action potential duration (APD) is a substrate for
   the maintenance of cardiac fibrillation, but the mechanisms are poorly
   understood. We investigated the role played by spatial APD dispersion in
   fibrillatory dynamics. We used an in vitro model in which spatial
   gradients in the expression of ether-a-go-go-related (hERG) protein, and
   thus rapid delayed rectifying K+ current (IKr) density, served to
   generate APD dispersion, high-frequency rotor formation, wavebreak and
   fibrillatory conduction. A unique adenovirus-mediated magnetofection
   technique generated well-controlled gradients in hERG and green
   fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in neonatal rat ventricular myocyte
   monolayers. Computer simulations using a realistic neonatal rat
   ventricular myocyte monolayer model provided crucial insight into the
   underlying mechanisms. Regional hERG overexpression shortened APD and
   increased rotor incidence in the hERG overexpressing region. An APD
   profile at 75 percent repolarization with a 16.6 +/- 0.72 ms gradient
   followed the spatial profile of hERG-GFP expression; conduction velocity
   was not altered. Rotors in the infected region whose maximal dominant
   frequency was =12.9 Hz resulted in wavebreak at the interface (border
   zone) between infected and non-infected regions; dominant frequency
   distribution was uniform when the maximal dominant frequency was <12.9
   Hz or the rotors resided in the uninfected region. Regularity at the
   border zone was lowest when rotors resided in the infected region. In
   simulations, a fivefold regional increase in IKr abbreviated the APD and
   hyperpolarized the resting potential. However, the steep APD gradient at
   the border zone proved to be the primary mechanism of wavebreak and
   fibrillatory conduction. This study provides insight at the molecular
   level into the mechanisms by which spatial APD dispersion contributes to
   wavebreak, rotor stabilization and fibrillatory conduction.}},

Abstract = {{Under the Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA), vehicles that run on
   ethanol, methanol, or natural gas get extra credits in the calculation
   of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE). This paper uses hedonic
   techniques to examine the effect of production of alternative-fuel
   vehicles (AFVs) on the implicit price of fuel economy. This study finds
   that, after AFVs came to market, the marginal value of fuel economy from
   companies producing them decreased. This finding suggests that
   manufacturers who produced AFVs were willing to offer a lower price for
   fuel economy, because automakers had an additional way to achieve fuel
   economy standards beyond improving the fuel efficiency of conventional
   cars. These findings bolster the argument that a major role of the AMFA
   credit for AFVs is to allow automakers to increase their production of
   fuel-inefficient vehicles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background The mechanisms by which viruses induce asthma exacerbations
   are not well understood.
   Objective We characterized fluctuations in nasal aspirate cytokines
   during naturally occurring respiratory viral infections in children with
   asthma.
   Methods Sixteen children underwent home collections of nasal aspirates
   when they were without cold symptoms and again during self-reported
   respiratory illnesses. The presence of viral infection was ascertained
   by multiplex PCR. Cytokines were measured using multiplex immune assay.
   mRNA expression for selected markers of viral infection was measured
   using RT-PCR. A cumulative respiratory symptom score was calculated for
   each day of measurement. Generalized estimated equations were used to
   evaluate associations between viral infection and marker elevation, and
   between marker elevation and symptom score.
   Results The 16 patients completed a total of 37 weeks of assessment (15
   well weeks; 22 self-assessed sick weeks). Viral infections were detected
   in 3 of the well weeks and 17 of the sick weeks (10 rhinovirus, three
   coronavirus, two influenza A, two influenza B, two respiratory syncytial
   virus, one parainfluenza). Compared to virus-negative well weeks, nasal
   aspirate IFN-gamma?, CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL5/RANTES,
   CCL11/eotaxin-1, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL4/MIP-1 beta, CCL7/MCP-3, and CCL20/MIP3
   alpha protein levels increased during virus-positive sick weeks. Only a
   subset of cytokines (IFN-gamma, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, and CCL20)
   correlated with self-reported respiratory tract symptoms. While many
   aspirates were dilute and showed no mRNA signal, viral infection
   significantly increased the number of samples that were positive for
   IFN-lambda 1, IFN-lambda 2/3, TLR3, RIG-I, and IRF7 mRNA.
   Conclusions and clinical relevance We conclude that in children with
   asthma, naturally occurring viral infections apparently induce a robust
   innate immune response including expression of specific chemokines,
   IFNs, and IFN-responsive genes.}},

Abstract = {{A novel terpeneacrylate photopolymerizable vehicle was used to fabricate
   porous polymer-ceramic composites and sintered porous ceramics. The
   vehicle consists of camphene, camphor and a diacrylate monomer. Alumina
   or silica suspensions were mixed above the melting point of the terpene.
   Upon cooling, the terpene crystallized from the solution as
   particle-free dendrites, with the powder and liquid monomer in the
   interdendritic spaces. The monomer could subsequently be solidified by
   photopolymerization. The rheological behavior is reported for ceramic
   suspensions in the molten terpenemonomer solution. The
   photopolymerization cure depth versus energy dose is reported for silica
   and alumina systems. The microstructure of the porous solid is
   characterized for systems with camphor/camphene and menthol as terpene.
   The structure of the dendritic porosity is compared as a function of
   powder volume fraction, for particles smaller or larger than the
   dendrite arm spacing.}},

Abstract = {{Unstable behavior of boiling water reactors (BWRs) is known to occur
   during operation at certain power and flow conditions. This paper
   reports on an uncertainty study of the impact of various parameters on
   the prediction of the stability of the BWR within the framework of the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Ringhals Unit 1
   (Ringhals-1) Stability Benchmark. The time domain code TRACE/PARCS was
   used in the analysis. The paper is divided into two parts: a sensitivity
   study on numerical parameters (nodalization, time step, etc.) and an
   uncertainty analysis of the stability event. The sensitivity study was
   based on a space-time converged solution, and the most important
   neutronic and thermal-hydraulic parameters were identified for
   parameterization. The uncertainty calculation was then performed using
   the well-established propagation of input errors methodology. Finally,
   the Spearman Rank method was used to identify the most influential
   parameters affecting the stability of Ringhals-1.}},

Volume = {{201}},

Pages = {{345-365}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce a stochastic interdiction problem for median
   systems in which the operational state of the system's disrupted
   elements in the aftermath of the disruption is uncertain as it is based
   on the intensity of the disruption. We assume that a disruption disables
   a facility with a given probability and this probability depends on the
   intensity of the disruption. The objective of this problem is to
   identify which disruption scenario entails a maximum overall traveling
   distance in serving all customers. We show that the initial two stage
   stochastic formulation can be reformulated into a deterministic
   counterpart whose size is polynomial in the number of facilities and
   intensity levels. Then, our ensuing efforts to solve the problem
   efficiently focus on studying alternative deterministic formulations
   that allow the solution of realistic size instances of the model. We
   observe that the most efficient of the deterministic formulations
   provide great scalability with respect to variations in the input
   parameters and size of the instances solved. Finally, we analyze the
   robustness of the optimal solutions due to misestimations in the
   probability functions that relate disruption intensity levels with the
   probabilities of facility survivability.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of the unsteady flow structure and force time history of
   pitching and plunging SD7003 and flat plate airfoils at low Reynolds
   numbers are presented. The airfoils were pitched and plunged in the
   effective angle of attack range of 2.4A degrees-13.6A degrees
   (shallow-stall kinematics) and -6A degrees to 22A degrees (deep-stall
   kinematics). The shallow-stall kinematics results for the SD7003 airfoil
   show attached flow and laminar-to-turbulent transition at low effective
   angle of attack during the down stroke motion, while the flat plate
   model exhibits leading edge separation. Strong Re-number effects were
   found for the SD7003 airfoil which produced approximately 25 \% increase
   in the peak lift coefficient at Re = 10,000 compared to higher Re flows.
   The flat plate airfoil showed reduced Re effects due to leading edge
   separation at the sharper leading edge, and the measured peak lift
   coefficient was higher than that predicted by unsteady potential flow
   theory. The deep-stall kinematics resulted in leading edge separation
   that led to formation of a large leading edge vortex (LEV) and a small
   trailing edge vortex (TEV) for both airfoils. The measured peak lift
   coefficient was significantly higher (similar to 50 \%) than that for
   the shallow-stall kinematics. The effect of airfoil shape on lift force
   was greater than the Re effect. Turbulence statistics were measured as a
   function of phase using ensemble averages. The results show anisotropic
   turbulence for the LEV and isotropic turbulence for the TEV. Comparison
   of unsteady potential flow theory with the experimental data showed
   better agreement by using the quasi-steady approximation, or setting
   C(k) = 1 in Theodorsen theory, for leading edge-separated flows.}},

Abstract = {{As a novel approach to future microrobotic locomotion, a
   multi-degree-of-freedom (m-DoF) microrobotic appendage is presented that
   generates large range of motion (5 degrees-40 degrees) in multiple axes
   using thin-film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuators. Due to the high
   driving force of PZT thin films and a robust fabrication process, m-DoF
   legs that retain acceptable payload capacity (similar to 2 mg per leg)
   are achieved. The fabrication process permits thin-film PZT actuator
   integration with more complex higher aspect ratio silicon structures
   than previous related processes, using vertical silicon dioxide barrier
   trenches formed before PZT deposition to provide robust encapsulation of
   the silicon during later XeF2 release. Planarization of the barrier
   trenches avoids detrimental effects on piezoelectric performance from
   the substrate alteration. Once fabricated, kinematic modeling of compact
   PZT actuator arrays in prototype leg joints is compared to experimental
   displacement measurements, demonstrating that piezoelectric actuator and
   assembled robot leg joint performance can be accurately predicted given
   certain knowledge of PZT properties and residual stress. Resonant
   frequencies, associated weight bearing, and power consumption are also
   obtained. {[}2012-0041]}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study resource allocation in decentralized information
   local public good networks. A network is a local public good network if
   each user's actions directly affect the utility of an arbitrary subset
   of network users. We consider networks where each user knows only that
   part of the network that either affects or is affected by it.
   Furthermore, each user's utility and action space are its private
   information, and each user is a self utility maximizer. This network
   model is motivated by several applications including wireless
   communications. For this network model we formulate a decentralized
   resource allocation problem and develop a decentralized resource
   allocation mechanism (game form) that possesses the following
   properties: (i) All Nash equilibria of the game induced by the mechanism
   result in allocations that are optimal solutions of the corresponding
   centralized resource allocation problem (Nash implementation). (ii) All
   users voluntarily participate in the allocation process specified by the
   mechanism (individual rationality). (iii) The mechanism results in
   budget balance at all Nash equilibria and off equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the diagnosability properties of labeled Petri
   nets. We consider the standard notion of diagnosability of languages,
   requiring that every occurrence of an unobservable fault event be
   eventually detected, as well as the stronger notion of diagnosability in
   K steps, where the detection must occur within a fixed bound of K event
   occurrences after the fault. We give necessary and sufficient conditions
   for these two notions of diagnosability for both bounded and unbounded
   Petri nets and then present an algorithmic technique for testing the
   conditions based on linear programming. Our approach is novel and based
   on the analysis of the reachability/coverability graph of a special
   Petri net, called Verifier Net, that is built from the Petri net model
   of the given system. In the case of systems that are diagnosable in K
   steps, we give a procedure to compute the bound K. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first time that necessary and sufficient
   conditions for diagnosability and diagnosability in K steps of labeled
   unbounded Petri nets are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Live broadcast over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network imposes a unique set of
   challenges to a digital rights management (DRM) system. Highly
   correlated service request arrivals at the start of a live event require
   peak-load provisioning if clients acquire licenses at playback time.
   Distributing the license management load across a P2P network requires
   the digital rights management system to ensure the integrity of both
   digital rights, the protection of client privacy and, at the same time,
   system scalability. In this paper we describe the requirements imposed
   on a digital rights management system in distributing live broadcast
   over a P2P network and present our design of such a system to meet the
   above challenges. We discuss the system's operation under a number of
   threat models and how to extend the system to further improve
   scalability and support network digital video recording (DVR). We close
   the paper after presenting some scalability results collected from a
   production P2P live broadcast network using our DRM design.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the ability to rapidly deposit (local deposition rates

   nitrogen gas carrying organic vapor toward a substrate, on which the
   organic molecules condense. A secondary jet of nitrogen coaxially
   surrounds the primary jet, shielding the organic vapor from the
   atmosphere. We study how the guard flow rate affects the printed film
   morphology and the resulting device properties. Notably, the
   crystallinity of the donor film can be increased while lowering the
   thin-film roughness, enhancing short circuit photocurrent nearly twofold
   over films printed without guard flow, allowing the photovoltaic power
   conversion efficiency of planar heterojunction SubPc/C-60 cells to
   exceed 2\% with SubPc deposited at ambient conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Fluorescent-labeled peptides are being developed to improve
   the endoscopic detection of colonic dysplasia.
   Objective: To demonstrate a near-infrared peptide multimer that
   functions as a phage mimic for in vivo detection of colonic adenomas.
   Design: A peptide multimer was synthesized by using trilysine as a
   dendritic wedge to mimic the presentation of peptides on phage, and all
   peptides, including the multimer, were fluorescent-labeled with Cy5.5.
   Setting: Small-animal imaging facility.
   Animal Subjects: Genetically engineered CPC;Apc mice that spontaneously
   develop colonic adenomas.
   Intervention: Near-infrared-labeled AKPGYLS peptide multimer was
   administered topically into the distal colons of the mice, and
   endoscopic images of adenomas were captured. Fluorescence intensities
   were quantified by target-to-background (T/B) ratios, and adenoma
   dimensions were measured with calipers after imaging. Validation of
   specific peptide binding was performed on cryosectioned specimens and
   cells by using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Fluorescence T/B ratios from colonic adenomas
   and adjacent normal-appearing mucosa.
   Results: AKP-multimer, monomer, trilysine core, and Cy5.5 resulted in
   mean (+/- SD) T/B ratios of 3.85 +/- 0.25, 2.21 +/- 0.13, 1.56 +/- 0.12,
   and 1.19 +/- 0.11, respectively, P < .01 on in vivo imaging. Peptide
   multimer showed higher contrast and greater specificity for dysplastic
   crypts as compared with other probes. Peptide multimer demonstrated
   significantly greater binding to HT29 cells on flow cytometry and
   fluorescence microscopy in comparison to monomer and trilysine core. A
   binding affinity of 6.4 nm/L and time constant of 0.1136 minutes(-1)
   (8.8 minutes) was measured for multimer.
   Limitations: Only distal colonic adenomas were imaged.
   Conclusion: Peptide multimers combine strengths of multiple individual
   peptides to enhance binding interactions and demonstrate significantly
   higher specificity and affinity for tumor targets. (Gastrointest Endosc

Abstract = {{The peripheral finned-tube (PFT) is a new geometry for enhanced air-side
   heat transfer under moisture condensate blockage (evaporators). It
   consists of individual hexagonal (peripheral) fin arrangements with
   radial fins whose bases are attached to the tubes and tips are
   interconnected with the peripheral fins. In this paper, experimentally
   validated semi-empirical models for the air-side heat transfer and
   pressure drop are combined with the entropy generation minimization
   theory to determine the optimal characteristics of PET heat exchangers.
   The analysis is based on three independent parameters, i.e., porosity,
   equivalent particle diameter and particle-based Reynolds number. The
   total heat transfer rate is a fixed constraint. The optimal heat
   exchanger configurations, i.e., those in which the entropy generation
   number reaches a minimum, are calculated for constant heat flux and
   constant tube wall temperature boundary conditions. Performance
   evaluation criteria of fixed geometry, fixed face area and variable
   geometry were implemented. In all cases, it was possible to determine a
   combination of independent parameters that provided a minimum entropy
   generation rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The field of heterogeneous photocatalysis has almost exclusively focused
   on semiconductor photocatalysts. Herein, we show that plasmonic metallic
   nanostructures represent a new family of photocatalysts. We demonstrate
   that these photocatalysts exhibit fundamentally different behaviour
   compared with semiconductors. First, we show that photocatalytic
   reaction rates on excited plasmonic metallic nanostructures exhibit a
   super-linear power law dependence on light intensity (rate proportional
   to intensity(n), with n > 1), at significantly lower intensity than
   required for super-linear behaviour on extended metal surfaces. We also
   demonstrate that, in sharp contrast to semiconductor photocatalysts,
   photocatalytic quantum efficiencies on plasmonic metallic nanostructures
   increase with light intensity and operating temperature. These unique
   characteristics of plasmonic metallic nanostructures suggest that this
   new family of photocatalysts could prove useful for many heterogeneous
   catalytic processes that cannot be activated using conventional thermal
   processes on metals or photocatalytic processes on semiconductors.}},

   brain-controlled prosthetic devices. The crucial material-dependent
   problem is developing microelectrodes that record neural activity from
   the same neurons for years with high fidelity and reliability. Here, we
   report the development of an integrated composite electrode consisting
   of a carbon-fibre core, a poly(p-xylylene)-based thin-film coating that
   acts as a dielectric barrier and that is functionalized to control
   intrinsic biological processes, and a poly(thiophene)-based recording
   pad. The resulting implants are an order of magnitude smaller than
   traditional recording electrodes, and more mechanically compliant with
   brain tissue. They were found to elicit much reduced chronic reactive
   tissue responses and enabled single-neuron recording in acute and early
   chronic experiments in rats. This technology, taking advantage of new
   composites, makes possible highly selective and stealthy neural
   interface devices towards realizing long-lasting implants.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Accurate localization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is
   critical to the success of deep brain stimulation surgery for Parkinson
   disease. Recent developments in high-field-strength magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) have made it possible to visualize the STN in greater
   detail. However, the relationship of the MR-visualized STN to the
   anatomic, electrophysiological, or atlas-predicted STN remains
   controversial.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the size of the STN visualized on 3-T MRI
   compared with anatomic measurements in cadaver studies and to compare
   the predictions of 3-T MRI and those of the Schaltenbrand-Wahren (SW)
   atlas for intraoperative STN microelectrode recordings.
   METHODS: We evaluated the STN by 3-T MRI and intraoperative
   microelectrode recordings in 20 Parkinson disease patients undergoing
   deep brain stimulation surgery. We compared our findings with anatomic
   cadaver studies and with the individually scaled SW atlas-based
   predictions for each patient.
   RESULTS: The dimensions of the 3-T MR-visualized STN were very similar
   to those of the largest anatomic study (MRI length, width, and height:
   9.8 +/- 1.6, 11.5 +/- 1.6, and 3.7 +/- 0.7 mm, respectively; n = 40;
   cadaver length, width, and height: 9.3 +/- 0.7, 10.6 +/- 0.9, and 3.1
   +/- 0.5 mm, respectively; n = 100). The amount of STN traversed during
   intraoperative microelectrode recordings was better correlated to the
   3-T MR-visualized STN than the SW atlas-predicted STN (R = 0.38 vs R =
   20.17).
   CONCLUSION: The STN as visualized on 3-T MRI corresponds well with
   cadaveric anatomic studies and intraoperative electrophysiology. STN
   visualization with 3-T MRI may be an improvement over SW atlas-based
   localization for STN deep brain stimulation surgery in Parkinson
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed and accurate information on the neutron background is relevant
   for many applications that involve radiation detection, both for
   non-coincidence and coincidence countings. In particular, for the
   purpose of developing advanced neutron-detection techniques for nuclear
   non-proliferation and nuclear safeguards, the energy-dependent,
   ground-level, neutron-background information is needed. There are only a
   few previous studies available about the neutron background below 10
   May, which is a typical neutron energy range of interest for nuclear
   non-proliferation and nuclear-safeguards applications. Thus, there is a
   potential for further investigation in this energy range. In this paper,
   neutron-background measurement results using organic-liquid
   scintillation detectors are described and discussed, with a direct
   application in optimization simulations of a fast-neutron imager based
   on liquid scintillators. The measurement was performed in summer 2011 in
   Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, and the measurement setup consisted of several
   EJ-309 liquid scintillators and a fast waveform digitizer. The average
   neutron flux below 6 MeV was measured to be approximately 4e-4
   counts/cm(2)/s. In addition, the relationship between the
   neutron-background count rate and various environmental quantities, such
   as humidity, at Earth's ground level was investigated and the results
   did not reveal any straightforward dependences. The measured pulse
   height distribution (PHD) was unfolded to determine the energy spectrum
   of the background neutrons. The unfolded neutron-background spectrum was
   implemented to a previously-created MCNPX-PoliMi model of the
   neutron-scatter camera and simple-backprojection images of the
   background neutrons were acquired. Furthermore, a simulated PHD was
   obtained with the MCNPX-PoliMi code using the ``Cosmic-Ray Shower
   Library{''} (CRY) source sub-routine which returns various types of
   radiation, including neutrons and photons at a surface, and accounts for
   solar cycle, altitude, and geomagnetic deflection. Comparison between
   the measured and simulated PHDs shows very good agreement. (C) 2012

   boundary electrode}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In many plasma materials processing applications requiring energetic ion
   bombardment such as plasma etching, control of the time-averaged ion
   energy distributions (IEDs) to surfaces is becoming increasingly
   important to discriminate between surface processes having different
   threshold energies. Inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs) are attractive in
   this regard since the plasma potential is low and so the energy of ion
   fluxes can be more finely tuned with externally applied biases. In these
   situations, pulsed plasmas provide another level of control as the IEDs
   from different times during the pulse power period can be combined to
   create the desired time-averaged IED. A recent development in
   controlling of IEDs in ICPs is the use of a boundary electrode (BE) in
   which a continuous or pulsed dc bias is applied to shift the plasma
   potential and modify the IEDs to surfaces without significant changes in
   the bulk plasma properties. Combinations of pulsing the ICP power and
   the BE bias provide additional flexibility to craft IEDs. In this paper
   we discuss results from a computational investigation of IEDs to a
   grounded substrate in low-pressure (a few to 50mTorr) ICPs sustained in
   argon. Results are compared with experimental measurements of plasma
   properties and IEDs. We demonstrate the ability to customize IEDs
   consisting of three energy peaks corresponding to the plasma potential
   during the plasma active glow, plasma afterglow and the plasma potential
   with the applied boundary voltage.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclic strain is known to affect endothelial cell phenotype, but its
   effects on neovascular pattern formation remain poorly understood. To
   examine how cyclic strain affects angiogenesis, we designed a
   stretchable, polydimethylsiloxane-based multi-well system that supports
   a 3D cell culture model of angiogenesis, consisting of endothelial cells
   coated onto microcarrier beads embedded in a fibrin gel with a
   supporting monolayer of smooth muscle cells atop the gel. Calibration of
   the integrated system showed a linear relationship between applied
   strain and strain within the fibrin gel. Capillaries formed in
   unstrained conditions grew radially outward, while 3D constructs
   subjected to 10\% cyclic strain at 0.7 Hz sprouted in a direction
   parallel to the applied strain. Removal of the tissue from the strain
   stimulus eliminated directional sprouting. To better understand this
   directional biasing, the strain field surrounding a microcarrier bead
   was modeled computationally, showing local strain anisotropy surrounding
   a microcarrier. Confocal reflection microscopy revealed only modest
   fiber alignment in regions of the gel close to microcarriers, with no
   evidence of alignment further away. Together, these data showed that
   externally applied cyclic strain can spatially pattern capillaries in a
   3D culture, and suggests a means to control pattern formation in
   engineered tissues.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid advancements in the computational capabilities of the graphics
   processing unit (GPU) as well as the deployment of general programming
   models for these devices have made the vision of a desktop supercomputer
   a reality. It is now possible to assemble a system that provides several
   TFLOPs of performance on scientific applications for the cost of a
   high-end laptop computer. While these devices have clearly changed the
   landscape of computing, there are two central problems that arise.
   First, GPUs are designed and optimized for graphics applications
   resulting in delivered performance that is far below peak for more
   general scientific and mathematical applications. Second, GPUs are power
   hungry devices that often consume 100-300 watts, which restricts the
   scalability of the solution and requires expensive cooling. To combat
   these challenges, this paper presents the PEPSC architecture-an
   architecture customized for the domain of data parallel dense matrix
   style scientific application where power efficiency is the central

   optical nature of the input signal in photoconductive antennas and the

Abstract = {{Periodontitis is a polymicrobial oral infection characterized by the
   destruction of tooth-supporting structures that can be linked to
   systemic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or rheumatoid
   arthritis. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium implicated in the
   etiology of periodontitis, has shown variation in inducing T-cell
   responses among different strains. Therefore, in this study we
   investigated the strain-specific immune response using a murine
   experimental model of periodontitis. Periodontitis was induced by P.
   gingivalis strains A7A1-28, W83 and W50, and later confirmed by the
   presence of P. gingivalis in the oral microflora and by alveolar bone
   resorption. Splenocytes were evaluated for gene expression, cellular
   proteins and cytokine expression. Dendritic cells were stimulated in
   vitro for T helper cellcytokine profiling. Results showed that P.
   gingivalis had the ability to alter the systemic immune response after
   bacterial exposure. Strains W50 and W83 were shown to induce alveolar
   bone loss, whereas the A7A1-28 strain did not significantly promote bone
   resorption in mice. Splenocytes derived from mice infected with strains
   W50 and W83 induced expression of high levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4)
   but A7A1-28 stimulated increased IL-10. Stimulation of dendritic cells
   in vitro showed a similar pattern of cytokine expression of IL-12p40,
   IL-6 and transforming growth factor-beta among strains. A distinct
   systemic response in vivo was observed among different strains of P.
   gingivalis, with IL-10 associated with the least amount of alveolar bone
   loss. Evaluation of pathogen-driven systemic immune responses associated
   with periodontal disease pathogenesis may assist in defining how
   periodontitis may impact other diseases.}},

Journal = {{NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Assemble-to-order (ATO) is an important operational strategy for
   manufacturing firms to achieve quick response to customer orders while
   keeping low finished good inventories. This strategy has been
   successfully used not only by manufacturers (e.g., Dell, IBM) but also
   by retailers (e.g., Amazon.com). The evaluation of order-based
   performance is known to be an important but difficult task, and the
   existing literature has been mainly focused on stochastic comparison to
   obtain performance bounds. In this article, we develop an extremely
   simple SteinChen approximation as well as its error-bound for
   order-based fill rate for a multiproduct multicomponent ATO system with
   random leadtimes to replenish components. This approximation gives an
   expression for order-based fill rate in terms of component-based fill
   rates. The approximation has the property that the higher the component
   replenishment leadtime variability, the smaller the error bound. The
   result allows an operations manager to analyze the improvement in
   order-based fill rates when the base-stock level for any component
   changes. Numerical studies demonstrate that the approximation performs
   well, especially when the demand processes of different components are
   highly correlated; when the components have high base-stock levels; or
   when the component replenishment leadtimes have high variability. (c)

Abstract = {{As tissue engineering products move toward the clinic, nondestructive
   methods to monitor their development and ensure quality are needed. In
   this study, high-resolution spectral ultrasound imaging (SUSI) was used
   to noninvasively characterize mineral content in collagen hydrogels.
   SUSI was used to generate three-dimensional (3D) grayscale (GS) images
   of construct morphology with submillimeter resolution. Spectral analysis
   of the backscattered radio frequency (RF) ultrasound signals was used to
   determine the midband fit (MBF) and slope of the linearized RF spectrum.
   These parameters are operator and instrument independent, and were used
   to characterize the spatial distribution of mineral in constructs
   supplemented with hydroxyapatite particles. GS and MBF correlated
   closely with mineral content, while slope was not dependent on
   concentration. SUSI also was used to monitor mineralization of collagen
   constructs by immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) over 21 days. The
   construct surface was mineralized before the interior, and there was a
   dose-dependent effect of SBF concentration on degree of mineralization
   and deposited particle size. MBF density was closely correlated with the
   amount of calcium deposited. These data demonstrate that SUSI has
   utility as a noninvasive imaging method for quantitative analysis of
   mineralization in 3D protein constructs. Such techniques may assist the
   development of engineered orthopedic tissues.}},

Abstract = {{The deposition of Cu clusters on a Si (0 0 1) substrate was studied
   using molecular dynamics simulations. EAM, SW and LJ potentials were
   used to describe the interaction between cluster atoms, substrate atoms,
   and the cluster-substrate interaction, respectively. Three cluster sizes
   comprised of 13, 55 and 147 atoms were deposited with various initial
   velocities (100, 500, 1000, 1500 and 3000 m/s). Results indicated that
   the degree of epitaxy and film flatness generally increased with the
   deposition velocity in a certain window. We found that Cu-13 cluster at
   1500 m/s, Cu-55 at 1000 m/s and Cu-147 at 500 m/s produced more flat
   epitaxial layers that matched well with the substrate surface. The flat
   morphology was much desired for the secondary cluster deposition. The
   epitaxial degree of a small cluster was higher than that of a large
   cluster at lower and higher velocities, while at moderate velocities a
   large cluster showed higher degree of epitaxy. The effect of cluster
   velocity on the height of mass center of the cluster was also
   identified. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the theoretical principles of subspace system
   identification as applied to the problem of estimating black-box
   state-space models of support-excited structures (e.g., structures
   exposed to earthquakes). The work distinguishes itself from past studies
   by providing readers with a powerful geometric interpretation of
   subspace operations that relates directly to theoretical structural
   dynamics. To validate the performance of subspace system identification,
   a series of experiments are conducted on a multistory steel frame
   structure exposed to moderate seismic ground motions; structural
   response data is used off-line to estimate black-box state-space models.
   Ground motions and structural response measurements are used by the
   subspace system identification method to derive a complete inputoutput
   state-space model of the steel frame system. The modal parameters of the
   structure are extracted from the estimated inputoutput state-space
   model. With the use of only structural response data, output-only
   state-space models of the system are also estimated by subspace system
   identification. The paper concludes with a comparison study of the modal
   parameters extracted from the inputoutput and output-only state-space
   models in order to quantify the uncertainties present in modal
   parameters extracted from output-only models. Copyright (C) 2012 John

Abstract = {{A theoretical framework is presented for the estimation of the physical
   parameters of a structure (i.e., mass, stiffness, and damping) from
   measured experimental data (i.e., inputoutput or output-only data). The
   framework considers two state-space models: a physics-based model
   derived from first principles (i.e., white-box model) and a data-driven
   mathematical model derived by subspace system identification (i.e.,
   black-box model). Observability canonical form conversion is introduced
   as a powerful means to convert the data-driven mathematical model into a
   physically interpretable model that is termed a gray-box model. Through
   an explicit linking of the white-box and gray-box model forms, the
   physical parameters of the structural system can be extracted from the
   gray-box model in the form of a finite element discretization. Prior to
   experimental verification, the framework is numerically verified for a
   multi-DOF shear building structure. Without a priori knowledge of the
   structure, mass, stiffness, and damping properties are accurately
   estimated. Then, experimental verification of the framework is conducted
   using a six-story steel frame structure under support excitation. With a
   priori knowledge of the lumped mass matrix, the spatial distribution of
   structural stiffness and damping is estimated. With an accurate
   estimation of the physical parameters of the structure, the gray-box
   model is shown to be capable of providing the basis for damage
   detection. With the use of the experimental structure, the gray-box
   model is used to reliably estimate changes in structural stiffness
   attributed to intentional damage introduced. Copyright (C) 2012 John

Abstract = {{The dynamic spectrum market (DSM) is a key economic vehicle for
   realizing the opportunistic spectrum access that will mitigate the
   anticipated spectrum-scarcity problem. DSM allows legacy spectrum owners
   to lease their channels to unlicensed spectrum consumers (or secondary
   users) in order to increase their revenue and improve spectrum
   utilization. In DSM, determining the optimal spectrum leasing price is
   an important yet challenging problem that requires a comprehensive
   understanding of market participants' interests and interactions. In
   this paper, we study spectrum pricing competition in a duopoly DSM,
   where two wireless service providers (WSPs) lease spectrum access
   rights, and secondary users (SUs) purchase the spectrum use to maximize
   their utility. We identify two essential, but previously overlooked,
   properties of DSM: 1) heterogeneous spectrum resources at WSPs and 2)
   spectrum sharing among SUs. We demonstrate the impact of spectrum
   heterogeneity via an in-depth measurement study using a software-defined
   radio (SDR) testbed. We then study the impacts of spectrum heterogeneity
   on WSPs' optimal pricing and SUs' WSP selection strategies using a
   systematic three-step approach. First, we study how spectrum sharing
   among SUs subscribed to the same WSP affects the SUs' achievable
   utility. Then, we derive the SUs' optimal WSP selection strategy that
   maximizes their payoff, given the heterogeneous spectrum propagation
   characteristics and prices. We analyze how individual SU preferences
   affect market evolution and prove the market convergence to a mean-field
   limit, even though SUs make local decisions. Finally, given the market
   evolution, we formulate the WSPs' pricing strategies in a duopoly DSM as
   a noncooperative game and identify its Nash equilibrium points. We find
   that the equilibrium price and its uniqueness depend on the SUs'
   geographical density and spectrum propagation characteristics. Our
   analytical framework reveals the impact of spectrum heterogeneity in a
   real-world DSM, and can be used as a guideline for the WSPs' pricing
   strategies.}},

Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Estimating link capacity in a wireless network is a complex task because
   the available capacity at a link is a function of not only the current
   arrival rate at that link, but also of the arrival rate at links which
   interfere with that link as well as of the nature of interference
   between these links. Models which accurately characterize this
   dependence are either too computationally complex to be useful or lack
   accuracy. Further, they have a high implementation overhead and make
   restrictive assumptions, which makes them inapplicable to real networks.
   In this paper, we propose CapEst, a general, simple yet accurate,
   measurement-based approach to estimating link capacity in a wireless
   network. To be computationally light, CapEst allows inaccuracy in
   estimation; however, using measurements, it can correct this inaccuracy
   in an iterative fashion and converge to the correct estimate. Our
   evaluation shows that CapEst always converged to within 5 percent of the
   correct value in less than 18 iterations. CapEst is model-independent;
   hence, it is applicable to any MAC/PHY layer and works with autorate
   adaptation. Moreover, it has a low implementation overhead, can be used
   with any application which requires an estimate of residual capacity on
   a wireless link and can be implemented completely at the network layer
   without any support from the underlying chipset.}},

Abstract = {{Full-thickness tears to the rotator cuff can cause severe pain and
   disability. Untreated tears progress in size and are associated with
   muscle atrophy and an infiltration of fat to the area, a condition known
   as fatty degeneration. To improve the treatment of rotator cuff tears, a
   greater understanding of the changes in the contractile properties of
   muscle fibers and the molecular regulation of fatty degeneration is
   essential. Using a rat model of rotator cuff injury, we measured the
   force generating capacity of individual muscle fibers and determined
   changes in muscle fiber type distribution that develop after a full
   thickness rotator cuff tear. We also measured the expression of mRNA and
   miRNA transcripts involved in muscle atrophy, lipid accumulation, and
   matrix synthesis. We hypothesized that a decrease in specific force of
   rotator cuff muscle fibers, an accumulation of type IIb fibers, and an
   upregulation in fibrogenic, adipogenic, and inflammatory gene expression
   occur in torn rotator cuff muscles. Thirty days following rotator cuff
   tear, we observed a reduction in muscle fiber force production, an
   induction of fibrogenic, adipogenic, and autophagocytic mRNA and miRNA
   molecules, and a dramatic accumulation of macrophages in areas of fat
   accumulation. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the cooling and lubrication properties of
   supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) sprays as potential substitutes
   for aqueous emulsions and straight oils used in the metalworking
   industry today. Sprays of rapidly expanding scCO(2) act to cool and
   lubricate machining and forming processes by delivering a mixture of dry
   ice and lubricant deep into the cutting/forming zone. In this work,
   experiments with turning, milling, drilling, thread cutting, and thread
   forming were performed with scCO(2) and other metalworking fluids (MWFs)
   to evaluate their relative performance with respect to tool wear and
   machining torque. Observations reveal that scCO(2)-MWF5 are more
   effective in removing heat from the tool-workpiece interface than
   conventionally delivered (flood) aqueous MWFs as well as other gas-based
   MWF sprays. In addition, scCO(2)-MWFs delivered in lubricant-expanded
   phase, where scCO(2) is used to increase volume of lubricant in the
   spray field, are shown to provide better lubricity than straight oils
   and oil-in-air minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) sprays. As a result,
   scCO(2)-MWFs can reduce tool wear and improve machining productivity in
   a wide range of manufacturing operations leading to appreciable
   improvements in the economics of manufacturing. Also given that CO2 is a
   recovered waste gas that is non-toxic, scCO(2)-MWF5 can improve the
   environmental and worker health performance of manufacturing operations.

Abstract = {{This paper exploits a natural symmetry present in a 3D robot in order to
   achieve asymptotically stable steering. The robot under study is
   composed of 5-links and unactuated point feet; it has 9 DoF
   (degree-of-freedom) in the single-support phase and six actuators. The
   control design begins with a hybrid feedback controller that stabilizes
   a straight-line walking gait for the 3D bipedal robot. The closed-loop
   system (i.e., robot plus controller) is shown to be equivariant under
   yaw rotations, and this property is used to construct amodification of
   the controller that has a local, but uniform, input-to-state stability
   (ISS) property, where the input is the desired turning direction. The
   resulting controller is capable of adjusting the net yaw rotation of the
   robot over a step in order to steer the robot along paths with mild
   curvature. An interesting feature of this work is that one is able to
   control the robot's motion along a curved path using only a single

Title = {{Analysis and optimization of a tethered wave energy converter in
   irregular waves}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{133-145}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An understanding of the fundamental system dynamics of wave energy
   converters (WECs) is required to safely and reliably benefit from the
   available wave energy resource to produce electricity. The effects of
   the geometry, mooring system, and mass distribution on the idealized
   power takeoff of a tethered wave energy absorber in irregular waves are
   examined. The effects on coupled pitch and sway motions are also
   considered using a linear frequency-domain method, based on potential
   flow theory, to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients. Superposition is
   used to calculate the response in irregular waves. The objectives of
   this paper are to examine the characteristic system response of WECs,
   and to demonstrate the use of an efficient potential-based method for
   the optimization of a WEC to maximize the annual power takeoff while
   ensuring system safety at a given site. The analyses suggest that the
   idealized power takeoff damping increases with the size of the WEC, with
   the intensity of motion limited. A relatively light mooring system has
   little effect on the power takeoff, but it introduces a low-frequency
   coupled pitch-surge resonance that can cause system failure if subject
   to long-period swells. To mitigate the risk of coupled surge-pitch
   related failures, a low center of gravity and a low radius of gyration
   of the floater about the center of floatation are recommended. The

Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL LIFE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{27-51}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{This article is motivated by the need to minimize the number of elements
   required to establish a self-reproducing system. One such system is a
   self-reproducing extraterrestrial robotic colony, which reduces the
   launch payload mass for space exploration compared to current mission
   configurations. In this work, self-reproduction is achieved by the
   actions of a robot on available resources. An important consideration
   for the establishment of any self-reproducing system is the
   identification of a seed, for instance, a set of resources and a set of
   robots that utilize them to produce all of the robots in the colony.
   This article outlines a novel algorithm to determine an optimal seed for
   self-reproducing systems, with application to a self-reproducing
   extraterrestrial robotic colony. Optimality is understood as the
   minimization of a cost function of the resources and, in this article,
   the robots. Since artificial self-reproduction is currently an open
   problem, the algorithm is illustrated with a simple robotic
   self-replicating system from the literature and with a more complicated
   self-reproducing example from nature.}},

Title = {{Configuring pnicogen rings in skutterudites for low phonon conductivity}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Dominant heat-carrying modes in skutterudites are associated with
   vibrations of the pnicogen rings. Apart from filling the structural
   cages with foreign species, disrupting the pnicogen ring structure by
   substitutional alloying should be an effective approach to reduce
   thermal conductivity. In this paper we explore alloying configurations
   of pnicogen rings (Sb rings in the case of CoSb3) that yield
   particularly low values of the thermal conductivity. We find that IV-VI
   double substitution (replacing two Sb atoms with one atom each from the
   column IV and column VI elements to achieve an average charge of two Sb
   atoms) is a very effective approach. Our ab initio calculations, in
   combination with a cluster expansion, have allowed us to identify stable
   alloy configurations on the Sb rings. Subsequent molecular and lattice
   dynamics simulations on low energy configurations establish the range of
   atomic displacement parameters and values of the thermal conductivity.
   Theoretical results are in good agreement with our experimental thermal
   conductivity values. Combining both approaches of compensated double
   substitution and filling of structural cages should be an effective way
   of improving the thermoelectric figure of merit of skutterudites.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{5, 1}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Kinesin is a processive molecular motor which transports various
   cellular cargos by converting chemical energy into mechanical movements.
   Although the motion of a single molecule has been characterized in
   several studies, the dynamics of collective transport remains
   controversial. Since the chemical reactions fueling molecular motors are
   stochastic processes, the movements of coupled motors are not perfectly
   synchronized. The goal of this study is to develop metrics to analyze
   the level of synchronization of coupled (stochastic) motors. The
   correlation among movements of coupled motors, the slackness, the
   cooperativity, and the power loss of kinesins are explored using the
   developed metrics. These metrics can be extended to characterize
   collective work done by other molecular motors also.}},

Title = {{Toward reliable ensemble Kalman filter estimates of CO2 fluxes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{The use of ensemble filters for estimating sources and sinks of carbon
   dioxide (CO2) is becoming increasingly common, because they provide a
   relatively computationally efficient framework for assimilating
   high-density observations of CO2. Their applicability for estimating
   fluxes at high-resolutions and the equivalence of their estimates to
   those from more traditional ``batch{''} inversion methods have not been
   demonstrated, however. In this study, we introduce a Geostatistical
   Ensemble Square Root Filter (GEnSRF) as a prototypical filter and
   examine its performance using a synthetic data study over North America
   at a high spatial (1 degrees x 1 degrees) and temporal (3-hourly)
   resolution. The ensemble performance, both in terms of estimates and
   associated uncertainties, is benchmarked against a batch inverse
   modeling setup in order to isolate and quantify the degradation in the
   estimates due to the numerical approximations and parameter choices in
   the ensemble filter. The examined case studies demonstrate that adopting
   state-of-the-art covariance inflation and localization schemes is a
   necessary but not sufficient condition for ensuring good filter
   performance, as defined by its ability to yield reliable flux estimates
   and uncertainties across a range of resolutions. Observational density
   is found to be another critical factor for stabilizing the ensemble
   performance, which is attributed to the lack of a dynamical model for
   evolving the ensemble between assimilation times. This and other results
   point to key differences between the applicability of ensemble
   approaches to carbon cycle science relative to its use in meteorological
   applications where these tools were originally developed.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the feasibility of characterizing the
   microstructures within a biological tissue by analyzing the frequency
   spectrum of the photoacoustic signal from the tissue. Hypotheses are
   derived from theoretical analyses on the relationships between the
   dimensions/concentrations of the photoacoustic sources within the
   region-of-interest and the linear model fitted to the power spectra of
   photoacoustic signals. The hypotheses are validated, following the
   procedures of ultrasound spectrum analysis, by simulations and
   experiments with phantoms fabricated by embedding the polyethylene
   microspheres in porcine gelatin, indicating that photoacoustic spectrum
   analysis could be a potential tool for characterizing microstructures in
   biological samples. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{An experimental investigation focusing on the effect of dissipation on
   the evolution of the Benjamin-Feir instability is reported. A series of
   wave trains with added sidebands, and varying initial steepness,
   perturbed amplitudes and frequencies, are physically generated in a long
   wave flume. The experimental results directly confirm the stabilization
   theory of Segur et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 539, 2005, pp. 229-271),
   i.e. dissipation can stabilize the Benjamin-Feir instability.
   Furthermore, the experiments reveal that the effect of dissipation on
   modulational instability depends strongly on the perturbation frequency.
   It is found that the effect of dissipation on the growth rates of the
   sidebands for the waves with higher perturbation frequencies is more
   evident than on those of waves with lower perturbation frequencies. In
   addition, numerical simulations based on Dysthe's equation with a linear
   damping term included, which is estimated from the experimental data,
   can predict the experimental results well if the momentum integral of
   the wave trains is conserved during evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Presented is a circuit implementation for the discrete-time zigzag map,
   which exhibits high speed, low power consumption, and above all
   resilience to process variations. Circuit parameter variations result in
   alteration of the chaotic map parameters, such as the slope and the
   location of the breakpoints in the map, which in turn degrade the
   randomness of the generated bit sequence or even cause the saturation
   problem when the map is used in a truly random number generator (TRNG).
   Because of the resilience of the presented circuit implementation to
   process variations, a truly random sequence is obtained that passes all
   the TRNG statistical test suites, after very simple post-processing of
   the output bit sequence.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial mapping of strain fields within compressed carbon nanotube (CNT)
   array columns is achieved using digital image correlation (DIC) analysis
   of in situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image sequences.
   Full-field displacement and strain maps are generated based upon the
   motion of the constituent CNTs, which serve as a traceable high-contrast
   speckle pattern for DIC analysis. The deformation modes and CNT array
   buckling characteristics vary systematically as a function of column
   aspect ratio, including bending, crushing, and bottom-up buckle
   accumulation behaviors. In spite of disparate appearing deformation
   modes, strain maps indicate that CNT array buckling consistently
   initiates at 5\% local principal strain (?2) for all columns. The
   ability to quantitatively assess the deformation modes and buckling
   behavior of CNT arrays at the nanoscale will enable their improved
   design for high-strain electrical contacts, compliant thermal
   interfaces, force sensors, energy-absorbing foams, or other
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of a physical sound
   stimulus. It is thought to arise from aberrant neural activity within
   central auditory pathways that may be influenced by multiple brain
   centers, including the somatosensory system. Auditory-somatosensory
   (bimodal) integration occurs in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), where
   electrical activation of somatosensory regions alters pyramidal cell
   spike timing and rates of sound stimuli. Moreover, in conditions of
   tinnitus, bimodal integration in DCN is enhanced, producing greater
   spontaneous and sound-driven neural activity, which are neural
   correlates of tinnitus. In primary auditory cortex (A1), a similar
   auditory-somatosensory integration has been described in the normal
   system (Lakatos etal., 2007), where sub-threshold multisensory
   modulation may be a direct reflection of subcortical multisensory
   responses (Tyll et al., 2011). The present work utilized simultaneous
   recordings from both DCN and A1 to directly compare bimodal integration
   across these separate brain stations of the intact auditory pathway.
   Four-shank, 32-channel electrodes were placed in DCN and A1 to
   simultaneously record tone-evoked unit activity in the presence and
   absence of spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5) electrical activation.
   Bimodal stimulation led to long-lasting facilitation or suppression of
   single and multi-unit responses to subsequent sound in both DCN and A1.
   Immediate (bimodal response) and long-lasting (bimodal plasticity)
   effects of Sp5-tone stimulation were facilitation or suppression of
   tone-evoked firing rates in DCN and A1 at all Sp5-tone pairing intervals
   (10, 20, and 40 ms), and greater suppression at 20 ms pairing-intervals
   for single unit responses. Understanding the complex relationships
   between DCN and A1 bimodal processing in the normal animal provides the
   basis for studying its disruption in hearing loss and tinnitus models.

Abstract = {{We created nanometer-scale transmembrane channels in lipid bilayers by
   means of self-assembled DNA-based nanostructures. Scaffolded DNA origami
   was used to create a stem that penetrated and spanned a lipid membrane,
   as well as a barrel-shaped cap that adhered to the membrane, in part via
   26 cholesterol moieties. In single-channel electrophysiological
   measurements, we found similarities to the response of natural ion
   channels, such as conductances on the order of 1 nanosiemens and channel
   gating. More pronounced gating was seen for mutations in which a single
   DNA strand of the stem protruded into the channel. Single-molecule
   translocation experiments show that the synthetic channels can be used
   to discriminate single DNA molecules.}},

   important to understand how the presence of other macromolecular

   essential component of many NP applications-was examined at different
   molar ratios and pH values. The central observation CdTe NPs into
   nanowires. The underlying mechanism of inhibition was attributed to the
   formation of a STAV corona and surface layer that precludes attachment
   of NPs to each other. Instead of nanowires, we observed a spectrum of
   agglomerates containing both CdTe and STAV of different geometries
   depending on the molar ratios of the reagents in NP synthesis and pH
   values of the media.}},

Abstract = {{The outcome of vascular-targeted therapies is generally determined by
   how efficiently vascular-targeted carriers localize and adhere to the
   endothelial wall at the targeted site. This study investigates the
   impact of leukocytes, platelets and red blood cells on the margination
   of vascular-targeted polymeric nanospheres and microspheres under
   various physiological blood flow conditions. We report that red blood
   cells either promote or hinder particle adhesion to an endothelial wall
   in a parallel plate flow chamber depending on the blood flow pattern,
   hematocrit, and particle size. Leukocytes prevent microspheres - but not
   nanospheres - from adhering in laminar and pulsatile flows via (1)
   competition for the available binding space and (2) physical removal of
   previously bound spheres. In recirculating blood flow, the negative
   effect of leukocytes on particle adhesion is minimal for large
   microspheres in the disturbed flow region beyond the flow reattachment.
   Resting platelets were found to have no effect on particle binding
   likely due to their dimensions and minimal interaction with the
   endothelial wall. Overall, the findings of the present work would be
   critical for designing effective vascular-targeted carriers for imaging
   and drug delivery applications in several human diseases. (C) 2012

   irradiation. Single-wall CNT-polymer composites preferentially aligned
   within the plane are irradiated with ultrafast laser pulses. After
   irradiation with distinct fluences at ambient conditions, morphology is

Abstract = {{Terminal electron accepting process (TEAP) zones developed when a.
   simulated groundwater containing dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate,
   arsenate, and sulfate was treated in a fixed-bed bioreactor system
   consisting of two reactors (reactors A and B) in series. When the
   reactors were operated with an empty bed contact time (EBCT) of 20 min
   each, DO-, nitrate-, sulfate-, and arsenate-reducing TEAP zones were
   located within reactor A. As a consequence, sulfate reduction and
   subsequent arsenic removal through arsenic sulfide precipitation and/or
   arsenic adsorption on or coprecipitation with iron sulfides occurred in
   reactor A. This resulted in the removal of arsenic-laden solids during
   backwashing of reactor A. To minimize this by shifting the
   sulfate-reducing zone to reactor B, the EBCT of reactor A was
   sequentially lowered from 20 min to 15, 10, and 7 min. While 50 mg/L
   (0.81 mM) nitrate was completely removed at all EBCTs, more than 90\% of
   300 mu g/L (4 mu M) arsenic was removed with the total EBCT as low as 27
   min. Sulfate- and arsenate reducing bacteria were identified throughout
   the system through clone libraries and quantitative PCR targeting the
   16S rRNA, dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase (dsrAB), and dissimilatory
   arsenate reductase (arrA) genes. Results of reverse transcriptase (RT)
   qPCR of partial dsrAB (i.e., dsrA) and arrA transcripts corresponded
   with system performance. The RT qPCR results indicated colocation of
   sulfate- and arsenate-reducing activities, in the presence of iron(II),
   suggesting their importance in arsenic removal.}},

Abstract = {{DNA melting analysis holds great promise for simple and fast DNA
   sequence discrimination. However, conventional fluorescence-based
   methods suffer from a small differential signal and demanding melting
   curve analysis, both of which make it difficult to distinguish the

   highly specific intracavity DNA melting analysis scheme utilizing an
   optofluidic laser. The laser optically amplifies the small yet intrinsic
   thermal dynamic difference between the target and the
   single-base-mismatched DNA, resulting in a differential signal that is
   orders of magnitude greater than with fluorescence-based methods. In
   particular, the existence of a phase transition between the stimulated
   laser emission and fluorescence (i.e., spontaneous emission) enables
   accurate determination of the DNA transition temperature difference.
   Furthermore, the high differential signal in the intracavity detection
   allows for scanning of the laser excitation at a fixed temperature to
   distinguish two DNA sequences, which provides another means for rapid
   DNA analysis. In this paper, we first theoretically investigate DNA
   melting analysis using an optofluidic laser and then experimentally
   explore this scheme with a high quality optofluidic ring resonator.
   Distinction of two DNA sequences of up to 100 bases long is demonstrated
   The intracavity detection developed here will lead to novel optofluidic
   devices that enable rapid and simple analysis of DNAs with very long
   sequences.}},

Title = {{Tracking lithium transport and electrochemical reactions in

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Expectations for the next generation of lithium batteries include
   greater energy and power densities along with a substantial increase in
   both calendar and cycle life. Developing new materials to meet these
   goals requires a better understanding of how electrodes function by
   tracking physical and chemical changes of active components in a working
   electrode. Here we develop a new, simple in-situ electrochemical cell
   for the transmission electron microscope and use it to track lithium
   transport and conversion in FeF2 nanoparticles by nanoscale imaging,
   diffraction and spectroscopy. In this system, lithium conversion is
   initiated at the surface, sweeping rapidly across the FeF2 particles,
   followed by a gradual phase transformation in the bulk, resulting in
   1-3nm iron crystallites mixed with amorphous LiF. The real-time imaging
   reveals a surprisingly fast conversion process in individual particles
   (complete in a few minutes), with a morphological evolution resembling
   spinodal decomposition. This work provides new insights into the
   inter-and intra-particle lithium transport and kinetics of lithium
   conversion reactions, and may help to pave the way to develop
   high-energy conversion electrodes for lithium-ion batteries.}},

Title = {{Convex Estimators for Optimization of Kriging Model Problems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a framework for identification of the global optimum
   of Kriging models that have been tuned to approximate the response of
   some generic objective function and constraints. The framework is based
   on a branch and bound scheme for subdivision of the search space into
   hypercubes while constructing convex underestimators of the Kriging
   models. The convex underestimators, which are the key development in
   this paper, provide a relaxation of the original problem. The relaxed
   problem has two main features: (i) convex optimization algorithms such
   as sequential quadratic programming (SQP) are guaranteed to find the
   global optimum of the relaxed problem and (ii) objective value of the
   relaxed problem is a lower bound within a hypercube for the original
   (Kriging model) problem. As accuracy of the convex estimators improves
   with subdivision of a hypercube, termination of a branch happens when
   either: (i) solution of the relaxed problem within the hypercube is no
   better than current best solution of the original problem or (ii) best
   solution of the original problem and that of the relaxed problem are
   within tolerance limits. To assess the significance of the proposed
   framework, comparison studies against genetic algorithm (GA), particle
   swarm optimization (PSO), random multistart sequential quadratic
   programming (mSQP), and DIRECT are conducted. The studies include four
   standard nonlinear test functions and two design application problems of
   water desalination and vehicle crashworthiness. The studies show the
   proposed framework deterministically finding the optimum for all the
   test problems. Among the tested stochastic search techniques (GA, PSO,
   mSQP), mSQP had the best performance as it consistently found the
   optimum in less computational time than the proposed approach except on
   the water desalination problem. DIRECT deterministically found the
   optima for the nonlinear test functions, but completely failed to find
   it for the water desalination and vehicle crashworthiness problems.

Title = {{Reduction of Torque-Induced Bending Vibrations in Ball Screw-Driven
   Machines via Optimal Design of the Nut}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{As a result of the push for sustainable machine designs, efforts are
   constantly being made to reduce the mass/inertia of moving machine
   components so as to minimize material usage and energy consumption.
   However, the reduction of structural stiffness that often accompanies
   such efforts gives rise to unwanted vibrations which must be effectively
   mitigated to ensure satisfactory performance of the designed machine.
   The ball screw mechanism (BSM) is commonly used in machines for motion
   and force transmission. Recent research has shown that, due to the
   coupling introduced by the nut, a torque applied to the shaft of a ball
   screw mechanism causes undesirable lateral (bending) vibrations of the
   screw, which adversely affect the fatigue life and positioning accuracy
   of ball screw-driven machines. In this paper, an analysis of the
   stiffness matrix connecting the screw to the nut is used to show that
   the entry/exit angle of the balls and the lead angle of the screw have
   the greatest influence on the coupling between the torsional and lateral
   directions. An objective function is proposed to minimize the static
   coupling between the applied torque and lateral deformations of the
   screw. The existence of local minima in the objective function is shown
   to be dependent on the cyclical characteristics of cross-coupling terms
   in the screw-nut interface stiffness matrix as a function of the
   entry/exit angle of the balls. Moreover, the sensitivity of the local
   minima to other nut/screw parameters is shown to highly depend on the
   lead angle. Simulations conducted on the finite element (FE) model of a
   single-axis ball screw-driven machine demonstrate that the optimally
   selected entry/exit angles result in a significant reduction of the
   low-frequency torque-induced vibrations of the machine compared to the
   unoptimized case, particularly when the lead angle is small. The
   proposed method is therefore suitable for reducing the torque-induced
   lateral vibrations of ball screws without increasing the diameter (i.e.,
   inertia) of the screw, thus leading to more sustainable designs of ball
   screw-driven machines. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007400]}},

Abstract = {{A passive control means to suppress flow-induced motions (FIM) of a
   rigid circular cylinder in the TrSL3, high-lift, flow regime is
   formulated and tested experimentally. The developed method uses passive
   turbulence control (PTC) consisting of selectively located roughness on
   the cylinder surface with thickness about equal to the boundary layer
   thickness. The map of ``PTC-to-FIM,{''} developed in previous work,
   revealed robust zones of weak suppression, strong suppression, hard
   galloping, and soft galloping. PTC has been used successfully to enhance
   FIM for hydrokinetic energy harnessing using the VIVACE Converter. PTC
   also revealed the potential to suppress FIM to various levels. The map
   is flow-direction dependent. In this paper, the `` PTC-to-FIM{''} map is
   used to guide development of FIM suppression devices that are
   flow-direction independent and hardly affect cylinder geometry.
   Experiments are conducted in the Low Turbulence Free Surface Water
   Channel of the University of Michigan on a rigid, horizontal, circular
   cylinder, suspended on springs. Amplitude and frequency measurements and
   broad field-of-view visualization reveal complex flow structures and
   their relation to suppression. Several PTC designs are tested to
   understand the effect of PTC roughness, location, coverage, and
   configuration. Gradual modification of PTC parameters, leads to improved
   suppression and evolution of a design reducing the VIV synchronization
   range. Over a wide range of high reduced velocities, VIV is fully
   suppressed. The maximum amplitude occurring near the system's natural
   frequency is reduced by about 63\% compared to the maximum amplitude of
   the smooth cylinder. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006235]}},

Abstract = {{We investigated hydrothermal liquefaction of Nannochloropsis sp. at
   different temperatures (250-400 degrees C), times (10-90 min), water
   densities (0.3-0.5 g/mL), and biomass loadings (5-35 wt \%).
   Liquefaction produced a biocrude with light and heavy fractions, along
   with gaseous, aqueous, and solid by-product fractions. The gravimetric
   yields of the product fractions from experiments at 250 degrees C summed
   to an average of 100 +/- 4 wt \%, showing mass balance closure at 250
   degrees C. The gravimetric yields of the product fractions are
   independent of water density at 400 degrees C. Increasing the biomass
   loading increases the biocrude yield from 36 to 46 wt \%. The yields of
   light and heavy biocrude depend on reaction time and temperature, but
   their combined yield depends primarily on temperature. Regardless of
   reaction time and temperature, the yield of products distributed to the
   aqueous phase is 51 +/- 5 wt \% and the light biocrude is 75 +/- 1 wt \%
   C. Two-thirds of the N in the alga is immediately distributed to the
   aqueous phase and up to 84\% can be partitioned there. Up to 85\% of the
   P is distributed to the aqueous phase in the form of free phosphate.
   Thus, N and P can be recovered in the aqueous phase for nutrient
   recycling. Up to 80\% of the chemical energy in the alga is retained
   within the biocrude. The quantitative results reported herein provide
   the basis for a reaction network for algae liquefaction. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Off-site construction has become increasingly popular in industrial
   construction projects over the past decade due to its advantages: higher
   productivity, better quality, better safety, and improved time and cost
   effectiveness. The fast-paced nature of off-site construction
   environments and the constraints induced by the construction site, along
   with the existing limitations within the shop, make the control process
   of off-site construction quite challenging. High-quality real-time data
   provided by utilizing new technologies can significantly improve and
   speed up the process of monitoring projects and identifying possible
   deviations; however, to be effective, decisions on corrective measures
   have to be made as quickly as possible. This paper presents an enhanced
   method based on the control theory concept for taking timely corrective
   actions to control the dynamic and fast-paced environments of off-site
   construction shops. The proposed method allows project managers to
   perform punctual nonlinear data analysis and predict the behavior of the
   performance of the shop. This leads to promptly determining the best
   corrective action in the case of variance to achieve a desired
   performance level with minimum cost. To illustrate its feasibility and
   potential for improving project control, the proposed approach was
   successfully implemented in an actual off-site structural steel
   fabrication shop. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000190. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Densely aligned sub 10 nm graphene nanoribbons are desirable for
   scale-up applications in nanoelectronics. We implemented directed
   self-assembly of block-copolymers in combination with nanoimprint
   lithography to pattern sub-10 nm half-pitch nanoribbons over large
   areas. These graphene nanoribbons have the highest density and
   uniformity to date. Multichannel field-effect transistors were made from
   such nanoribbons, and the transport characteristics of transistors were
   studied. Our work indicates that a large ribbon-to-ribbon width
   variation in a multichannel FET can lead to nonsynchronized switching
   characters of multiple graphene channels and thus a poor ON/OFF current
   ratio. Through process optimization, we have created 8 nm half pitch
   graphene nanoribbons, with the minimal ribbon-to-ribbon width variation
   of similar to 2.4 nm (3 sigma value). The corresponding transistors
   exhibit an ON/OFF current ratio > 10, which is among the highest values
   ever reported for. transistors consisting of densely arranged graphene
   nanoribbons. This work provides important insights for optimizing the
   uniformity and transport properties of lithographically patterned
   graphene nanostructures. In addition, the presented fabrication route
   could be further developed for the scalable nanomanufacturing of
   graphene-based nanoelectronic devices over large areas.}},

Abstract = {{Improving transportation infrastructure inspection methods and the
   ability to assess conditions of bridges has become a priority in recent
   years as the transportation infrastructure continues to age. Current
   bridge inspection techniques consist largely of labor-intensive
   subjective measures for quantifying deterioration of various bridge
   elements. Some advanced nondestructive testing techniques, such as
   ground-penetrating radar, are being implemented; however, little
   attention has been given to remote sensing technologies. Remote sensing
   technologies can be used to assess and monitor the condition of bridge
   infrastructure and improve the efficiency of inspection, repair, and
   rehabilitation efforts. Most important, monitoring the condition of a
   bridge using remote sensors can eliminate the need for traffic
   disruption or total lane closure because remote sensors do not come in
   direct contact with the structure. The purpose of this paper is to
   evaluate 12 potential remote sensing technologies for assessing the
   bridge deck and superstructure condition. Each technology was rated for
   accuracy, commercial availability, cost of measurement, precollection
   preparation, complexity of analysis and interpretation, ease of data
   collection, stand-off distance, and traffic disruption. Results from
   this study demonstrate the capabilities of each technology and their
   ability to address bridge challenges. DOI:

Abstract = {{The atmospheric entry phase of a Mars mission is one of the most
   important mission phases of the nearly two-year journey. During the
   entry, a vehicle experiences major difficulties which are related to
   heating, communication, and deceleration. To solve these entry issues,
   the typical methods, such as the thermal protection system and
   aerodynamic parachute, are employed. However, these methods have
   limitations as a solution of Mars entry issues because of the properties
   of the Martian atmosphere. For solving the Mars entry issues, the
   innovative concepts of plasma-based magnetohydrodynamic systems could be
   applicable instead of the classical methods. In this study, numerical
   simulation is used to evaluate the feasibility of the
   magnetohydrodynamic system for the future planetary entry missions in
   terms of heating, communication, and deceleration. To demonstrate the
   possibility for a magnetohydrodynamic system as a solution of the Mars
   entry issues, the geometry of the Mars Pathfinder is numerically
   simulated in hypersonic flow with a magnetohydrodynamic system using a
   hypersonic flow code. The simulation results show that the innovative
   concepts using a magnetohydrodynamic system, magnetic heat shield, and
   magnetic parachute could provide an alternative solution for heating and
   deceleration issues during Mars entry. Since current superconducting
   electromagnet technology makes it possible to generate a strong magnetic
   field within a reasonable weight, the proposed system has the potential
   to be employed in future planetary entry missions.}},

Abstract = {{Ground motion modification (or spectral matching) has been criticized,
   but has many appealing characteristics and is widely used in practice.
   Modification of ground motions can be performed in either the time
   domain or the frequency domain. Depending on the choice of modification
   technique, modified ground motions can be significantly different from
   each other as well as from the original ground motion. This paper
   studies the impact of these differences on seismic geotechnical analyses
   for two different site profiles using two earthquake scenarios and a
   total of 20 ground motions. This study shows that the final results are
   influenced by many factors such as the original (seed) ground motion,
   the target spectrum, and the local site conditions, in addition to the
   ground motion modification technique used. The results also show that
   while both techniques can significantly modify the original ground
   motion, neither technique is consistently more conservative than the
   other. Therefore, a general conclusion that a particular technique
   results in ground motions that yield the largest intensity parameters
   cannot be made a priori. {[}DOI: 10.1193/1.4000077]}},

Abstract = {{This Note presents a new asymmetric flexure design, the double
   parallelogram-tilted-beam double parallelogram (DP-TDP) flexure, that
   enables two times higher stroke in electrostatic comb-drive actuators,
   compared to the traditional symmetrically paired double parallelogram
   (DP-DP) flexure, while maintaining the same device footprint. Because of
   its unique kinematic configuration, the DP-TDP flexure provides an
   improved stiffness ratio between the bearing and actuation directions,
   thus delaying the on-set of sideways instability. Experimental testing
   of micro-fabricated comb-drive actuators with flexure beam length 1 mm
   and comb gap 5 mu m demonstrates a stroke of 149 mu m (at 86 V) for the
   proposed DP-TDP flexure, in comparison to 75 mu m (at 45 V) for the
   traditional DP-DP flexure. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The mixture proportions of engineered cementitious composites (ECCs) are
   optimized through micromechanics-based material design theory to attain
   high tensile ductility. Therefore, ECC ingredients with inappropriate
   characteristics (such as type and amount of mineral admixture and size

   the microstructure of the composite and the tensile ductility of the

   the dependence of the composite properties on its mixture composition

Abstract = {{This paper describes a valve-regulated architecture, for intrathecal,
   insulin and other drug delivery systems, that offers high performance
   and volume efficiency through the use of micromachined components.
   Multidrug protocols can be accommodated by using a valve manifold to
   modulate and mix drug flows from individual reservoirs. A
   piezoelectrically-actuated silicon microvalve with embedded pressure
   sensors is used to regulate dosing by throttling flow from a
   mechanically-pressurized reservoir. A preliminary prototype system is
   demonstrated with two reservoirs, pressure sensors, and a control
   circuit board within a 130 cm(3) metal casing. Different control modes
   of the programmable system have been evaluated to mimic clinical
   applications. Bolus and continuous flow deliveries have been
   demonstrated. A wide range of delivery rates can be achieved by
   adjusting the parameters of the manifold valves or reservoir springs.
   The capability to compensate for changes in delivery pressure has been
   experimentally verified. The pressure profiles can also be used to
   detect catheter occlusions and disconnects. The benefits of this
   architecture compared with alternative options are reviewed. (C) 2012

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY B}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{High resolution patterning on nonplanar substrates with large height
   variation using electron beam lithography is reported. Using an
   automatic, high precision, noncontact laser probe microscope, a
   three-dimensional map of the nonplanar substrate to be patterned is
   obtained first. This data are converted to a format for the electron
   beam lithography system, which performs the write by adjusting the plane
   of electron beam focus based on the mapping data. As a proof of concept
   of this patterning scheme, three different kinds of nonplanar substrates
   were used including a tilted Si wafer for a uniform and unidirectional
   tilt, a planoconvex lens for a multidirectional tilt, and deep Si
   trenches with a step height variation. The patterning scheme was tested
   for resolution, field stitching accuracy, and field placement accuracy.
   The results of these tests are in very close agreement with typical
   results that are obtained for flat substrates with similar patterning
   conditions. For wafers with 10 mm tilt, 50 nm gratings show a line width
   variation of 18\%, average field stitching error of 1.06 nm with a 3
   sigma of 24.62 nm, and field placement error of 20.53 nm with a 3 sigma
   variation of 31.92 nm. The simplicity of this method and the fact that
   it can be applied for various nonplanar substrates with nanometer scale
   precision and over large areas open up a new avenue for the fabrication
   of devices based on nonplanar substrates. (C) 2012 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{The optimal sizing and control of a hybrid tracked vehicle is presented
   and solved in this paper. A driving schedule obtained from field tests
   is used to represent typical tracked vehicle operations. Dynamics of the
   diesel engine-permanent magnetic AC synchronous generator set, the
   lithium-ion battery pack, and the power split between them are modeled
   and validated through experiments. Two coupled optimizations, one for
   the plant parameters, forming the outer optimization loop and one for
   the control strategy, forming the inner optimization loop, are used to
   achieve minimum fuel consumption under the selected driving schedule.
   The dynamic programming technique is applied to find the optimal
   controller in the inner loop while the component parameters are
   optimized iteratively in the outer loop. The results are analyzed, and
   the relationship between the key parameters is observed to keep the
   optimal sizing and control simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Diesel exhaust emissions have been reported for a number of engine
   operating strategies, after treatment technologies; and fuels; However,
   information is limited regarding emissions of many pollutants during
   idling and when biodiesel fuels are used This study investigates
   regulated and unregulated emissions from both light duty passenger car
   (1.7 L) and medium duty (6.4 L) diesel engines at idle and load and
   compares a biodiesel blend (B20) to conventional ultralow sulfur diesel
   (ULSD) fuel. Exhaust aftertreatment devices included a diesel oxidation
   catalyst (DOC) and a diesel particle filter (DPF). For the 1.7 L engine
   under load without a DOC, B20 reduced brake-specific emissions of
   particulate matter (PM), elemental carbon (EC), nonmethane hydrocarbons
   (NMHCs), and most volatile organic compounds (VOCs) compared to ULSD;
   however, formaldehyde brake-specific emissions increased. With a DOC and
   high load, B20 increased brake-specific emissions of NMHC, nitrogen
   oxides (NOx), formaldehyde, naphthalene, and Several other VOCs. For.
   the 64 L engine under load, B20 reduced brake specific emissions of
   PM2.5, BC, formaldehyde, and most VOCs; however, NOx brake specific
   emissions increased. When idling,:the effects of fuel type were
   different: B20 increased NMHC, PM2.5, EC, formaldehyde, benzene, and
   other VOC emission rates from both engines, and changes were sometimes
   large, e.g., PM2.5 increased by 60\% for the 6.4 L/2004 calibration
   engine, and benzene by 40\% for the L engine with the DOC, possibly
   reflecting incomplete combustion and unburned fuel. Diesel exhaust
   emissions depended on the fuel type and engine load (idle versus
   loaded):. The higher emissions found when using B20 are especially
   important given the recent attention to exposures from idling vehicles
   and the health significance of PM2.5. The emission profiles demonstrate
   the effects of fuel type, engine calibration, and emission,control
   system, and they can be used as source profiles for apportionment,
   inventory, and exposure purposes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a gust load alleviation system based on model-predictive
   control is developed for a very flexible aircraft. Two main
   contributions presented in this work are as follows. First, a unified
   dynamics framework is developed to represent the full
   six-degrees-of-freedom rigid body along with the structural dynamics.
   This allows for an integrated control design to account for
   maneuverability (flying qualities) and aeroelasticity simultaneously,
   leading to a new and improved configuration for a very flexible
   aircraft. Second, an improved model-predictive control formulation is
   proposed for stabilization and gust load alleviation. The performance of
   the model-predictive control is further improved by introducing an
   additional feedback loop to increase the prediction accuracy. To
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the integrated
   formulation is compared with existing approaches. Further, the load
   alleviation performance is evaluated for various discrete and continuous
   gusts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a direct model reference adaptive controller for
   single-input/single-output discrete-time (and thus sampled-data) systems

   requires knowledge of the nonminimum-phase zeros of the transfer
   function from the control to the output. This controller uses a
   retrospective performance, which is a surrogate measure of the actual
   performance, and a cumulative retrospective cost function, which is

Abstract = {{Determining how the heliospheric magnetic field and plasma connect to
   the Sun's corona and photosphere is, perhaps, the central problem in
   solar and heliospheric physics. For much of the heliosphere, this
   connection appears to be well understood. It is now generally accepted
   that so-called coronal holes, which appear dark in X-rays and are
   predominantly unipolar at the photosphere, are the sources of
   quasi-steady wind that is generally fast, > 500 km/s, but can sometimes
   be slow. However, the connection to the Sun of the slow, non-steady wind
   is far from understood and remains a major mystery. We review the
   existing theories for the sources of the non-steady wind and demonstrate
   that they have difficulty accounting for both the observed composition
   of the wind and its large angular extent. A new theory is described in
   which this wind originates from the continuous opening and closing of
   narrow open field corridors in the corona, which give rise to a web of
   separatrices (the S-Web) in the heliosphere. Note that in this theory
   the corona-heliosphere connection is intrinsically dynamic, at least for
   this type of wind. Support for the S-Web model is derived from MHD
   solutions for the corona and wind during the time of the August 1, 2008
   eclipse. Additionally, we perform fully dynamic numerical simulations of
   the corona and heliosphere in order to test the S-Web model as well as
   the interchange model proposed by Fisk and co-workers. We discuss the
   implications of our simulations for the competing theories and for
   understanding the corona-heliosphere connection, in general.}},

Abstract = {{The soft deposition of Cu clusters on a Si (001) surface was studied by
   molecular dynamics simulations. The embedded atom method, the Stillinger
   Weber and the Lennar Jones potentials were used to describe the
   interactions between the cluster atoms, between the substrate atoms, and
   between the cluster and the substrate atoms, respectively. The Cu-13,
   Cu-55, and Cu-147 clusters were investigated at different substrate
   temperatures. We found that the substrate temperature had a significant
   effect on the Cu-147 cluster. For smaller Cu-13 and Cu-55 clusters, the
   substrate temperature in the range of study appeared to have little
   effect on the mean center-of-mass height. The clusters showed better
   degrees of epitaxy at 800 K. With the same substrate temperature, the
   Cu-55 cluster demonstrated the highest degree of epitaxy, followed by
   Cu-147 and then Cu-13 clusters. In addition, the Cu-55 cluster showed
   the lowest mean center-of-mass height. These results suggested that the
   Cu-55 cluster is a better choice for the thin-film formation among the
   clusters considered. Our studies may provide insight into the formation
   of desired Cu thin films on a Si substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Current thoracic artificial lungs (TALs) have blood flow impedances
   greater than the natural lungs, which can result in abnormal pulmonary
   hemodynamics. This study investigated the impedance and gas transfer
   performance of a compliant TAL (cTAL). Fluid-structure interaction
   analysis was performed using ADINA (ADINA R\&D Inc., Watertown, MA) to
   examine the effect of the inlet and outlet expansion angle,., on device
   impedance and blood flow patterns. Based on the results, the theta = 45
   degrees model was chosen for prototyping and in vitro testing. Glycerol
   was pumped through this cTAL at 2, 4, and 6 L/min at 80 and 100
   beats/min, and the zeroth and first harmonic impedance moduli, Z(0) and
   Z(1), were calculated. Gas transfer testing was conducted at blood flow
   rates of 3, 5, and 7 L/min. Fluid-structure interaction results
   indicated that the 45 model had an ideal combination of low impedance
   and even blood flow patterns and was thus chosen for prototyping. In
   vitro, Z(0) = 0.53 +/- 0.06 mm Hg/(L/min) and Z(1) = 0.86 +/- 0.08 mm
   Hg/(L/min) at 4 L/min and 100 beats/min. Outlet PO2 and SO2 values were
   above 200 mm Hg and 99.5\%, respectively, at each flow rate. Thus, the
   cTAL had lower impedance than hard shell TALs and excellent gas
   transfer. ASAIO Journal 2012;58:583-589.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic time reversal (STR) is a technique for blind deconvolution of
   receiving-array recordings of sound from an unknown source in an unknown
   multipath environment. It relies on generic features of multipath sound
   propagation. In prior studies, the pivotal ingredient for STR, an
   estimate of the source-signal's phase (as a function of frequency
   omega), was generated from conventional beamforming of the
   received-signal Fourier transforms, P-j(omega), 1 <= j <= N, where N is
   the number of array elements. This paper describes how STR is
   implemented even when the receiving-array elements are many wavelengths
   apart and conventional beamforming is inadequate. Here, the
   source-signal's phase is estimated by beamforming
   P-j{*}(omega(1))P-j(omega(2)) at the difference frequency omega(2) -
   omega(1). This extension of STR is tested with broadband signal pulses
   (11-19 kHz) and a vertical 16-element receiving array having a
   3.75-m-spacing between elements using simple propagation simulations and
   measured results from the FAF06 experiment involving 2.2 km of down
   slope propagation from 46 to 92m water depth. The cross-correlation
   coefficient between the source-broadcast and STR-reconstructed-signal
   waveforms for the simulations and experiments are 98\% and 91\%-92\%,
   respectively. In addition, frequency-difference beamforming can be used
   to determine signal-path-arrival angles that conventional beamforming
   cannot. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{Low back pain is a leading health problem in the United States, which is
   most often resulted from nucleus pulposus (NP) degeneration. To date,
   the replacement of degenerated NP relies entirely on mechanical devices.
   However, a biological NP replacement implant is more desirable. Here, we
   report the regeneration of NP tissue using a biodegradable nanofibrous
   (NF) scaffold. Rabbit NP cells were seeded on the NF scaffolds to
   regenerate NP-like tissue both in vitro and in a subcutaneous
   implantation model. The NP cells on the NF scaffolds proliferated faster
   than those on control solid-walled (SW) scaffolds in vitro.
   Significantly more extracellular matrix (ECM) production
   (glycosaminoglycan and type II collagen) was found on the NF scaffolds
   than on the control SW scaffolds. The constructs were then implanted in
   the caudal spine of athymic rats for up to 12 weeks. The
   tissue-engineered NP could survive, produce functional ECM, remain in
   place, and maintain the disc height, which is similar to the native NP
   tissue.}},

   abnormal pulmonary hemodynamics. New compliant TALs (cTALs), however,
   have an impedance lower than that of the natural lung.
   Methods. In this study, a cTAL of new design was attached between the
   pulmonary artery (PA) and the left atrium (LA) in 5 sheep (60.2 +/- 1.9
   kg). A distal PA band was placed to control the percentage of cardiac
   output (CO) routed to the cTAL. Rest and exercise conditions were
   simulated using a continuous dobutamine infusion of 0 and 5 mu g/kg/min,
   respectively. At each dose, a hemodynamic data set was acquired at
   baseline (no flow to the cTAL), and 60\%, 75\%, and 90\% of CO was
   shunted to the cTAL.
   Results. Device resistance did not vary with blood flow rate, averaging
   0.51 +/- 0.03 mm Hg/(L/min). Under all conditions, CO was not
   significantly different from baseline. Pulmonary system impedance
   increased above baseline only with 5 mu g/kg/min of dobutamine and 90\%
   of CO diverted to the cTAL.
   Conclusions. Results indicated minimal changes in pulmonary hemodynamics
   during PA-LA cTAL attachment for high device flows under rest and
   exercise conditions. (Ann Thorac Surg 2012;94:1688-94) (C) 2012 by The

Title = {{Age-related changes in speed and accuracy during rapid targeted center

Abstract = {{Background: Backward falls are often associated with injury,
   particularly among older women. An age-related increase occurs in center
   of pressure variability when standing and leaning. So, we hypothesized
   that, in comparison to young women, older women would display a
   disproportionate decrease of speed and accuracy in the primary center of
   pressure submovements as movement amplitude increases.
   Methods: Ground reaction forces were recorded from thirteen healthy
   young and twelve older women while performing rapid, targeted, center of
   pressure movements of small and large amplitude in upright stance.
   Measures included center of pressure speed, the number of center of
   pressure submovements, and the incidence rate of primary center of
   pressure submovements undershooting the target.
   Findings: In comparison to young women, older women used slower primary
   submovements, particularly as movement amplitude increased (P < 0.01).
   Even though older women achieved similar endpoint accuracy, they
   demonstrated a 2 to 5-fold increase in the incidence of primary
   submovement undershooting for large-amplitude movements (P < 0.01).
   Overall, posterior center of pressure movements of older women were 41\%
   slower and exhibited 43\% more secondary submovements than in young
   women (P < 0.01).
   Interpretations: We conclude that the increased primary submovement
   undershoots and secondary center of pressure submovements in the older
   women reflect the use of a conservative control strategy near the
   posterior limit of their base of support. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Model identification for impact dynamics of a piezoelectric

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A parameterized model for the impact dynamics of a piezoelectric
   microactuator is proposed, and a system-identification procedure for
   quantifying model parameters is presented. The proposed model
   incorporates squeeze-film damping, adhesion and
   coefficient-of-restitution effects. Following parameter quantification
   from sample data of bouncing impacts and progressive ramped-square-wave
   inputs, the model is found to be effective in predicting the time
   response of the actuator to a range of square-wave and sinusoidal
   inputs. The main contributions of this paper are to show that the
   dynamic response to micro-scale contact can be predicted using simple
   lumped-parameter modeling after a proposed system-identification
   procedure is performed and that certain small-scale forces can be
   quantified. For example, for motions where bounce of the cantilever tip
   may occur, the range of adhesion is found to be time dependent and vary
   between approximately 20 and 520 nN, while the range of squeeze-film
   damping is estimated to be between 50 and 130 nN, depending on the input
   signal frequency and amplitude. The presence, absence and quantity of
   bounces upon impact are predicted very accurately, while oscillation
   amplitudes and contact durations are predicted to be between 1\% and
   30\% error for the majority of many test cases of periodic inputs
   between 5 and 100 Hz.}},

Abstract = {{Battery State of Charge (SOC) estimation is an important function for
   battery management systems and critical for the reliable operations of
   batteries. This paper analyzes the robustness of SOC estimation
   algorithms for two types of Li-ion batteries under varying loading
   conditions, temperatures and aging levels. Based on the model templates
   identified in an earlier research, the model parameters are determined.
   The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) technique is then adopted as the SOC
   estimation algorithm. The robustness of the estimator against varying
   loading profiles and temperatures is evaluated and compared against the
   Coulomb counting method. We subsequently used data from cells that have
   significantly aged to assess the robustness of the SOC estimation
   algorithm. Finally, the need for model parameter updates is analyzed.

Abstract = {{Al-Cu alloys containing various amounts of Cu (2-5 wt.\%) are designed
   to increase the hydrogen production rate in an alkaline solution by
   precipitating the electrochemically noble Al2Cu phase along the grain

   precipitates, which is electrochemically noble to Al in an alkaline
   solution, along the grain boundary. The hydrogen generation rate of
   Al-Cu alloys increases as the amount of Cu increases, and the Al- 5
   wt.\% Cu alloy exhibits a 4.7 times greater hydrogen generation rate
   than that of pure Al. This significant increase in hydrogen generation
   is affected by the combined action of galvanic corrosion and
   intergranular corrosion. When hydrogen produced by the hydrolysis of Al
   Cu alloys is directly fed to a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell
   (PEMFC) anode, the cell voltage exhibits a stable value of approximately
   0.73 V without a humidifier. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although multiple methods have been developed to detect metal cations,
   only a few offer sensitivities below 1 pM, and many require complicated
   procedures and sophisticated equipment. Here, we describe a class of
   simple solid-state sensors for the ultrasensitive detection of
   heavy-metal cations (notably, an unprecedented attomolar limit for the
   detection of CH3Hg+ in both standardized solutions and environmental
   samples) through changes in the tunnelling current across films of
   nanoparticles (NPs) protected with striped monolayers of organic
   ligands. The sensors are also highly selective because of the
   ligand-shell organization of the NPs. On binding of metal cations, the
   electronic structure of the molecular bridges between proximal NPs
   changes, the tunnelling current increases and highly conductive paths
   ultimately percolate the entire film. The nanoscale heterogeneity of the
   structure of the film broadens the range of the cation-binding
   constants, which leads to wide sensitivity ranges (remarkably, over 18
   orders of magnitude in CH3Hg+ concentration).}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to apply stress constraints to structural
   topology optimization problems with design-dependent loading. A
   comparison of mass-constrained compliance minimization solutions and
   stress-constrained mass minimization solutions is also provided.
   Although design-dependent loading has been the subject of previous
   research, only compliance minimization has been studied.
   Stress-constrained mass minimization problems are solved in this paper,
   and the results are compared with those of compliance minimization
   problems for the same geometries and loading. A stress-relaxation
   technique is used to avoid the singularity in the stress constraints,
   and these constraints are aggregated in blocks to reduce the total
   number of constraints in the optimization problem. The results show that
   these design-dependent loading problems may converge to a local minimum
   when the stress constraints are enforced. The use of a continuation
   method where the stress-constraint aggregation parameter is gradually
   increased typically leads to better convergence; however, this may not
   always be possible. The results also show that the topologies of
   compliance-minimization and stress-constrained solutions are usually
   vastly different, and the sizing optimization of a compliance solution
   may not lead to an optimum.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the redundancy of Huffman codes. In particular,
   we consider sources for which the probability of one of the source
   symbols is known. We prove a conjecture of Ye and Yeung regarding the
   upper bound on the redundancy of such Huffman codes, which yields in a
   tight upper bound. We also derive a tight lower bound for the redundancy
   under the same assumption. We further apply the method introduced in
   this paper to other related problems. It is shown that several other
   previously known bounds with different constraints follow immediately
   from our results.}},

Abstract = {{Periostin, a matricellular adapter protein highly expressed by
   periodontal ligament fibroblasts, is implicated in the maintenance of
   periodontal integrity, which is compromised during periodontal diseases.
   The aim of this study was to explore the influence of chronic
   periodontal inflammation on tissue periostin levels. Periodontal
   breakdown was induced in a pre-clinical ligature periodontal
   inflammatory disease model. Periodontal tissue specimens were harvested
   at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks and prepared for histologic,
   immunofluorescence, and micro-CT examination. Statistical analyses were
   conducted by Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, and Spearman's tests.
   Periostin detection levels were reduced over time in response to the
   inflammatory process (1 +/- 0.05; 0.67 +/- 0.03; 0.31 +/- 0.02; p <
   0.001; baseline, 2, and 4 weeks, respectively). Simultaneously, alveolar
   bone loss increased from baseline to the 2- and 4-week time-points (0.40
   +/- 0.02 mm; 1.39 +/- 0.08 mm; 1.33 +/- 0.15 mm; p < 0.001), which was
   inversely correlated with the levels of periostin (rho = -0.545; p <
   0.001). In conclusion, periostin PDL tissue levels significantly
   decrease under chronic inflammatory response and correlate with the
   detrimental changes to the periodontium over time.}},

Abstract = {{The present work deals with recognition of handwritten characters of
   Bangla, a major script of the Indian sub-continent. The main
   contributions presented here are (a) generation of a database of
   handwritten basic characters of Bangla and (b) development of a
   handwritten character recognition scheme suitable for scripts like
   Bangla consisting of many similar shaped characters for the benchmark
   results. The present database is a pioneering development in the context
   of recognition of off-line handwritten characters of this script. It has
   37,858 handwritten samples and accommodates a large spectrum of
   handwriting style by Bangla speaking population. This database will be
   made available
   (http://www.isical.ac.in/{*}ujjwal/download/Banglabasiccharacter.html)
   free of cost to researchers for further studies. Also, we identified two
   major factors affecting high recognition accuracies for the present
   character samples, namely, (a) erratic nature of the presence of
   headline (shapes of Bangla characters usually contain a horizontal line
   in its upper part) and (b) existence of several pairs of similar shaped
   characters. The proposed recognition approach takes care of the above
   factors. It identifies any confusion in the first stage classification
   between a pair of similar shaped character classes and resolves the same
   in the second stage classification by extracting a feature vector based
   on a non-uniform grid.}},

Abstract = {{Linkages among bioreactor operation and performance and microbial
   community structure were investigated for a fixed-bed biofilm system
   designed to remove perchlorate from drinking water. Perchlorate removal
   was monitored to evaluate reactor performance during and after the
   frequency and intensity of the backwash procedure were changed, while
   the microbial community structure was studied using clone libraries and
   quantitative PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene. When backwash frequency
   was increased from once per month to once per day, perchlorate removal
   initially deteriorated and then recovered, and the relative abundance of
   perchlorate-reducing bacteria (PRB) initially increased and then
   decreased. This apparent discrepancy suggested that bacterial
   populations other than PRB played an indirect role in perchlorate
   removal, likely by consuming dissolved oxygen, a competing electron
   acceptor. When backwash intensity was increased, the reactor gradually
   lost its ability to remove perchlorate, and concurrently the relative
   abundance of PRB decreased. The results indicated that changes in
   reactor operation had a profound impact on reactor performance through
   altering the microbial community structure. Backwashing is an important
   yet poorly characterized procedure when operating fixed-bed biofilm
   reactors. Compared to backwash intensity, changes in backwash frequency
   exerted less disturbance on the microbial community in the current
   study. If this finding can be confirmed in future work, backwash
   frequency may serve as the primary parameter when optimizing backwash
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Alginate hydrogel (AH) has intrinsic physical and biological limitations
   that hinder its broader application in tissue engineering. We
   hypothesized that the inclusion of nanofibers in the hydrogel and the
   use of a biotemplate that mimics nature would enhance the translational
   potential of alginate hydrogels. In this study, we have shown a method
   to obtain nano-/microfibers of titanium (nfTD) and hydroxyapatite (nfHY)
   using cotton as a biotemplate. These fibers were incorporated in the
   alginate hydrogel and the mechanical characteristics and biological
   response to these reinforced materials were evaluated. We observed that
   these nanofibers resembled the structure of natural collagen and did not
   mediate cell toxicity. The incorporation of nfTD or nfHY to the AH has
   not increased the viscosity of the hydrogel. Therefore, this is a
   feasible method to produce a scaffold with improved physical
   characteristics, while at the same time generating an enhanced
   environment for cell adhesion and proliferation. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{The average length of threadlike micelles in a semidilute solution has
   been inferred from the ratio of loss to storage modulus at a local
   minimum in loss modulus, which occurs at frequencies well above
   terminal. This method has yielded average micelle lengths of less than 1
   mu m or so for cetyltrimethylammonium surfactants at concentrations of
   around 0.1 to 1 M {[}Khatory , Langmuir 9, 1456-1464 (1993)]. Here, I
   use established correlations for polymer semidilute solutions to show
   that this estimate of micelle length is likely too small by around an
   order of magnitude. More accurate estimates can be obtained from the
   terminal relaxation time and the viscosity near the cross-over from
   dilute to semidilute, which show typical micelle average lengths that
   are well above 1 mu m in length, for cetyltrimethylammonium solutions.

Abstract = {{We reveal that the collective growth of vertically aligned carbon
   nanotube (CNT) forests by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is governed by
   the size-dependent catalytic behavior of metal nanoparticles, which can
   be quantitatively related to the activation and deactivation kinetics of
   subpopulations of CNTs within the forest. We establish this
   understanding by uniquely combining real-time forest height kinetics
   with ex situ synchrotron X-ray scattering and mass-attenuation
   measurements. The growing CNT population is divided into subpopulations,
   each having a narrow diameter range, enabling the quantification of the
   diameter-dependent population dynamics. We find that the mass kinetics
   of different subpopulations are self-similar and are represented by the
   S-shaped Gompertz model of population growth, which reveals that smaller
   diameter CNTs activate more slowly but have longer catalytic lifetimes.
   While competition between growth activation and deactivation kinetics is
   diameter-dependent, CNTs are held in contact by van der Waals forces,
   thus preventing relative slip and resulting in a single collective
   growth rate of the forest. Therefore, we hypothesize that mechanical
   coupling gives rise to the inherent tortuosity of CNTs within forests
   and possibly causes structural defects which limit the properties of
   current CNT forests in comparison to pristine individual CNTs. (c) 2012

Title = {{An Energy Management Controller to Optimally Trade Off Fuel Economy and

Abstract = {{Hybrid vehicle fuel economy performance is highly sensitive to the
   energy management strategy used to regulate power flow among the various
   energy sources and sinks. Optimal non-causal solutions are easy to
   determine if the drive cycle is known a priori. It is very challenging
   to design causal controllers that yield good fuel economy for a range of
   possible driver behavior. Additional challenges come in the form of
   constraints on powertrain activity, such as shifting and starting the
   engine, which are commonly called ``drivability{''} metrics and can
   adversely affect fuel economy. In this paper, drivability restrictions
   are included in a shortest path stochastic dynamic programming (SP-SDP)
   formulation of the real-time energy management problem for a prototype
   vehicle, where the drive cycle is modeled as a stationary, finite-state
   Markov chain. When the SP-SDP controllers are evaluated with a
   high-fidelity vehicle simulator over standard government drive cycles,
   and compared to a baseline industrial controller, they are shown to
   improve fuel economy more than 11\% for equivalent levels of
   drivability. In addition, the explicit tradeoff between fuel economy and
   drivability is quantified for the SP-SDP controllers.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR)-based Wi-Fi 2.0 hotspots are introduced as an
   attractive application of dynamic spectrum access (DSA), at which a
   wireless service provider (WSP) leases licensed channels via secondary
   market and offers Internet access to CR-enabled customers by
   opportunistically utilizing the leased spectrum. The CR users access the
   channels only when they are temporarily unoccupied by their legacy
   users, and pay a usage charge according to the WSP's pricing policy. In
   this paper, we study the profit maximization problem of a WSP by
   deriving the (sub) optimal control of admission (at CR user arrivals)
   and eviction (upon return of the legacy users) of CR users. We formulate
   the problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) with two
   quality-of-service (QoS) constraints on arrival-blocking and
   service-dropping probabilities, which is solved by the linear
   programming techniques. Using an extensive numerical analysis, we show
   that the derived policy achieves up to 22.5-44 percent more profit than
   simple complete-sharing algorithms in the tested scenarios. In addition,
   we evaluate the impact of the number of leased channels and pricing on
   the achieved profit, and study the tradeoffs between the two QoS
   constraints.}},

Title = {{Measurement point selection and modal damping identification for bladed
   disks}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{97-108}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A novel measurement point selection (MPS) technique for bladed disks and
   integrally bladed disks (blisks) is presented and applied to a new modal
   damping identification method. When gathering data to be used for
   applications such as damping identification in blisks, it is important
   to measure points which provide sufficient and accurate information for
   the analysis. However, to reduce the experimental time and cost, the
   measurement points should be chosen optimally so that the minimum number
   of measurements have to be collected. This paper discusses a modified
   form of the effective independence distribution vector (EIDV) method
   presented by Penny et al. and adapted by Holland et al. The key aspect
   of the proposed method is that it uses only single sector-level
   calculations instead of the full system. A residual weighting optimizes
   the MPS technique by ranking individual measurement locations according
   to their noise sensitivity. The method presented provides results
   equivalent to the full-system EIDV method, but it decreases the
   computational cost, increases the robustness of the identification, and
   minimizes the measurement time. Also, a novel method to identify a
   damping parameter for each mode in a frequency range of interest is
   presented. This method utilizes the proposed MPS technique to increase
   the accuracy of the identification. Measurement locations and modal
   damping results for a 30 degree of freedom system and a blisk with a
   more complex geometry are presented. Using the proposed methodologies it
   is possible to obtain an accurate modal damping identification with a
   decreased computational and measurement cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Microstructural origins of the variability in fatigue lifetime observed
   in the high- and very-high-cycle fatigue regimes in titanium alloys were
   explored by examining the role of microstructural heterogeneity
   (neighborhoods of grains with similar crystallographic orientations or
   microtexture) on the initiation and early growth of fatigue cracks in
   Ti-6246. Ultrasonic fatigue of focused ion beam (FIB) micronotched
   samples was used to investigate long lifetime (10(7) to 10(9)) behavior
   for two microstructural conditions: one with microtexture and one
   without microtexture. For specimens containing notches of nominally 20
   mu m in length, fatigue crack initiation in the microtextured material
   was most likely to occur from notches placed in neighborhoods with a
   microtexture favorably oriented for easy basal slip. Initiation
   lifetimes in the untextured material with similar sized notches were, on
   average, slightly greater than those for the microtextured condition. In
   both materials, the crack-initiation lifetime from micronotches of
   length 2c > 20 mu m was a very small fraction (< 1 pct) of the measured
   fatigue lifetime for unnotched specimens. Furthermore, in the
   microtextured condition, small fatigue crack propagation rates did not
   correlate with the microtextured regions and did not statistically
   differ from average small crack growth rates in the untextured material.
   As the micronotch size was reduced below 20 mu m, fatigue crack
   initiation was controlled by microstructure rather than by FIB-machined
   defects. Finally, predictions of the fraction of life consumed in small
   and long fatigue crack growth from preexisting cracks nominally
   equivalent in size to the micronotches was compared with the measured
   fatigue life of unnotched specimens. The predicted range of lifetimes
   when factoring in the experimentally observed variability in small
   fatigue crack growth, only accounted for 0.1 pct of the observed fatigue
   lifetime variability. These findings indicate that in the high-and
   very-high-cycle fatigue regimes, fatigue life is dominated by crack
   initiation and that the variation in the initiation lifetime is
   responsible for the observed variation in total fatigue life.}},

   deflection generally reaches a peak value and then gradually decreases.
   The results show that CBN grinding has a lower (about 1/3 - 1/2)
   grinding force and smaller (about 1/4 - 1/3) wire deflection than that
   of the SiC. Compared to SS wire, the NiTi exhibits a larger grinding
   force and wire deflection, lower surface roughness, and the breakage of
   wire at the collet chucking location using the SiC wheel due to the high
   stress induced phase transformation and brittle fracture. The grinding
   forces and wire tip deflection have large effects on the contact length
   and grinding time. A model based on the measured grinding forces as the
   input is developed to estimate the wire deflection and grinding time.
   This model is validated with experimental measurements and the effects
   of burr formation and NiTi phase transformation on grinding time are
   discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The surface properties of the Li2O2 discharge phase are expected to
   impact strongly the capacity, rate capability, and rechargeability of
   Li-oxygen batteries. Prior calculations have suggested that the presence
   of half-metallic surface states in Li2O2 may mitigate electrical
   passivation resulting from the growth of Li2O2, which is a bulk
   insulator. Here we revisit the electronic structure of bulk Li2O2 and
   the dominant Li2O2 \{0001\} surface by comparing results obtained with
   the PBE GGA functional, the HSE06 hybrid functional, and quasiparticle
   GW methods. Our results suggest that the bulk band gap lies between the
   value predicted by the G(0)W(0) method, 5.15 eV, and the value predicted
   by the self-consistent quasiparticle GW (scGW) approximation, 6.37 eV.
   The PBE, HSE06, and scGW methods agree that the most stable surface, an
   oxygen-rich \{0001\} termination, is indeed half-metallic. This result
   supports the notion that the electronic structure of surfaces may play
   an important role in understanding performance limitations in Li-oxygen
   batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Bone marrow-derived stromal/stem cells (BMSCs) have recently been
   characterized as mediators of tissue regeneration after injury. In
   addition to preventing fibrosis at the wound site, BMSCs elicit an
   angiogenic response within the fibrin matrix. The mechanistic
   interactions between BMSCs and invading endothelial cells (ECs) during
   this process are not fully understood. Using a three-dimensional,
   fibrin-based angiogenesis model, we sought to investigate the
   proteolytic mechanisms by which BMSCs promote vessel morphogenesis. We
   find that BMSC-mediated vessel formation depends on the proteolytic
   ability of membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). Knockdown
   of the protease results in a small network of vessels with enlarged
   lumens. Contrastingly, vessel morphogenesis is unaffected by the
   knockdown of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Furthermore, we find that BMSC-mediated
   vessel morphogenesis in vivo follows mechanisms similar to what we
   observe in vitro. Subcutaneous, cellular fibrin implants in C.B-17/SCID
   mice form aberrant vasculature when MMPs are inhibited with a
   broad-spectrum chemical inhibitor, and a very minimal amount of vessels
   when MT1-MMP proteolytic activity is interrupted in ECs. Other studies
   have debated the necessity of MT1-MMP in the context of vessel invasion
   in fibrin, but this study clearly demonstrates its requirement in
   BMSC-mediated angiogenesis. J. Cell. Physiol. 227: 35463555, 2012. (C)

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{A photoconductive terahertz emitter based on plasmonic contact electrode
   gratings is presented and experimentally demonstrated. The nanoscale
   grating enables ultrafast and high quantum efficiency operation
   simultaneously, by reducing the photo-generated carrier transport path
   to the photoconductor contact electrodes. The presented photoconductor
   eliminates the need for a short-carrier lifetime semiconductor, which
   limits the efficiency of conventional photoconductive terahertz
   emitters. Additionally, the photo-absorbing active area of the plasmonic
   photoconductive terahertz emitter can be increased without a significant
   increase in the capacitive loading to the terahertz radiating antenna,
   enabling high quantum-efficiency operation at high pump power levels by
   preventing the carrier screening effect and thermal breakdown. A
   plasmonic photoconductive terahertz emitter prototype based on the
   presented scheme is implemented and integrated with dipole antenna
   arrays on a semi-insulating In0.53Ga0.47As substrate. Emitted terahertz
   radiation is characterized in a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy
   setup, measuring a terahertz pulse width of 590 fs full-width at half
   maximum in response to 150 fs pump pulses at 925 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies of the flow topology, leading-edge vortex dynamics
   and unsteady force produced by pitching and plunging flat-plate
   aerofoils in forward flight at Reynolds numbers in the range 5000-20 000
   are described. We consider the effects of varying frequency and plunge
   amplitude for the same effective angle-of-attack time history. The
   effective angle-of-attack history is a sinusoidal oscillation in the
   range -6 to 22 degrees with mean of 8 degrees and amplitude of 14
   degrees. The reduced frequency is varied in the range 0.314-1.0 and the
   Strouhal number range is 0.10-0.48. Results show that for constant
   effective angle of attack, the flow evolution is independent of Strouhal
   number, and as the reduced frequency is increased the leading-edge
   vortex (LEV) separates later in phase during the downstroke. The LEV
   trajectory, circulation and area are reported. It is shown that the
   effective angle of attack and reduced frequency determine the flow
   evolution, and the Strouhal number is the main parameter determining the
   aerodynamic force acting on the aerofoil. At low Strouhal numbers, the
   lift coefficient is proportional to the effective angle of attack,
   indicating the validity of the quasi-steady approximation. Large values
   of force coefficients (similar to 6) are measured at high Strouhal
   number. The measurement results are compared with linear potential flow
   theory and found to be in reasonable agreement. During the downstroke,
   when the LEV is present, better agreement is found when the wake effect
   is ignored for both the lift and drag coefficients.}},

Title = {{Hydraulic resistance to overland flow on surfaces with partially
   submerged vegetation}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates numerically the characteristics of upscaling the
   Manning resistance coefficient (n(t)) for areas covered by partially
   submerged vegetation elements, such as shrub or tree stems. A number of
   high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations were carried out corresponding
   to scenarios with different domain slopes (S), inflow rates (Q), bed
   roughness (n(b)), and vegetation cover fractions (V-f). Using
   simulations performed at fine space-time scales, two methods were
   developed for computing the upscaled Manning coefficient, termed
   ``Equivalent Roughness Surface (ERS){''} and ``Equivalent Friction Slope
   (EFS).{''} Results obtained with these two methods indicate that both
   yield highly correlated estimates of n(t). The effects of four
   independent variables (Vf, S, Q, and n(b)) on n(t) were further
   investigated. First, as V-f increases, n(t) also grows. Second, two
   distinct modes of the relationship between S and n(t) for a fixed V-f
   and Q emerge: a positive dependence at low-flow rates and a negative
   dependence at high-flow rates. For a fixed V-f and S, two distinct modes
   of the relationship between Q and n(t) are also identified: a positive
   dependence at mild domain slopes and a negative dependence at steep
   slopes. A regression analysis shows that the two conflicting trends can
   occur depending on whether the variability of flow depth with respect to
   S (or Q) is greater than the ratio of h and S (or Q). Third, a rougher
   soil bed (i.e., larger values of n(b)) implies a higher resistance due
   to vegetation. Last, the study argues that n(t) increases as h increases
   and decreases as V increases. A generic regression relation that
   includes all four of the above variables and the difference n(t) - n(b)
   (i.e., the additional resistance due to partially submerged vegetation
   representing the sum of the form and wave resistances) was developed.
   The range of applicability of this relation is given by the following
   conditions: V-f <= 0.5, 0.1 <= S <= 1.1, and 0.0001 <= Q <= 0.01. The
   difference n(t) - n(b) computed from the developed regression relation
   was compared with estimates reported by five different studies.
   Furthermore, the simulated wave resistance coefficients were compared
   with those predicted from an equation in a previous study; the estimates
   were consistent in the range of experimental conditions for which the
   latter equation was developed. The relationship is sufficiently general
   and applicable to other flow conditions with partially submerged
   roughness elements.}},

   Electron Beam}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW X}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{A number of theoretical calculations have studied the effect of
   radiation-reaction forces on radiation distributions in strong-field
   counterpropagating electron-beam-laser interactions, but could these
   effects-including quantum corrections-be observed in interactions with
   realistic bunches and focusing fields, as is hoped in a number of
   soon-to-be-proposed experiments? We present numerical calculations of
   the angularly resolved radiation spectrum from an electron bunch with
   parameters similar to those produced in laser-wakefield-acceleration
   experiments, interacting with an intense, ultrashort laser pulse. For
   our parameters, the effect of radiation damping on the angular
   distribution and energy distribution of photons is not easily
   discernible for a realistic moderate-emittance electron beam. However,
   experiments using such a counterpropagating beam-laser geometry should
   be able to measure these effects using current laser systems through
   measurement of the electron-beam properties. In addition, the brilliance
   of this source is very high, with peak spectral brilliance exceeding
   10(29) photons s(-1) mm(-2) mrad(-2) (0.1\% bandwidth)(-1) with an
   approximately 2\% conversion efficiency and with a peak energy of 10
   MeV.}},

Abstract = {{Oligomers containing the new fused-ring heterocyclic conjugated building
   block thieno{[}3,2-b]furan were synthesized, and the effects associated
   with furan ring substitution into fused-ring oligothiophenes on the
   electronic properties and solid-state structure were assessed. A series
   of four ring oligomers which vary in. the degree of furan ring
   substitution and the regiochemistry of placement were synthesized via
   Stille cross coupling and oxidative homocoupling strategies. The
   electronic properties of these oligomers were studied by UV-vis
   absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. Substitution of furan rings
   at the terminal positions yields oligomers with a narrower HOMO-LUMO gap
   relative to the all-thiophene analogue 2,2'-bithieno{[}3,2-b]thiophene,
   and incorporation of furan rings at the interior positions results in
   oligomers with an increase in rigidity and a higher fluorescence quantum
   yield. Packing motifs of the oligomers were determined using single
   crystal X-ray diffraction. In contrast to the herringbone crystal
   packing observed for nonfused oligothiophenes, oligofurans,
   thiophene-furan hybrid oligomers, and the all-thiophene analogue
   2,2'-bithieno{[}3,2-b]thiophene, all three regioisomers derived from the

Title = {{Traditional Male Circumcision in Uganda: A Qualitative Focus Group
   Discussion Analysis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: The growing body of evidence attesting to the effectiveness
   of clinical male circumcision in the prevention of HIV/AIDS transmission
   is prompting the majority of sub-Saharan African governments to move
   towards the adoption of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). Even
   though it is recommended to consider collaboration with traditional male
   circumcision (TMC) providers when planning for VMMC, there is limited
   knowledge available about the TMC landscape and traditional beliefs.
   Methodology and Main Findings: During 2010-11 over 25 focus group
   discussions (FGDs) were held with clan leaders, traditional cutters, and
   their assistants to understand the practice of TMC in four ethnic groups
   in Uganda. Cultural significance and cost were among the primary reasons
   cited for preferring TMC over VMMC. Ethnic groups in western Uganda
   circumcised boys at younger ages and encountered lower rates of TMC
   related adverse events compared to ethnic groups in eastern Uganda.
   Cutting styles and post-cut care also differed among the four groups.
   The use of a single razor blade per candidate instead of the traditional
   knife was identified as an important and recent change. Participants in
   the focus groups expressed interest in learning about methods to reduce
   adverse events.
   Conclusion: This work reaffirmed the strong cultural significance of TMC
   within Ugandan ethnic groups. Outcomes suggest that there is an
   opportunity to evaluate the involvement of local communities that still
   perform TMC in the national VMMC roll-out plan by devising safer, more
   effective procedures through innovative approaches.}},

   for plasma breakdown}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{41}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Gas bubbles submerged in a dielectric liquid and driven by an electric
   field can undergo dramatic changes in both shape and volume. In certain
   cases, this deformation can enhance the distribution of the applied
   field inside the bubble as well as decrease the internal gas pressure.
   Both effects will tend to facilitate plasma formation in the gas volume.
   A practical realization of these two effects could have a broad impact
   on the viability of liquid plasma technologies, which tend to suffer
   from high voltage requirements. In this experiment, bubbles of diameter
   0.4-0.7 mm are suspended in the node of a 26.4 kHz underwater acoustic
   standing wave and excited into nonlinear shape oscillations using ac
   electric fields with amplitudes of 5-15 kV cm(-1). Oscillations of the
   deformed bubble are photographed with a high-speed camera operating at
   5130 frames s(-1) and the resulting images are decomposed into their
   axisymmetric spherical harmonic modes, Y-l(0), using an edge detection
   algorithm. Overall, the bubble motion is dominated by the first three
   even modes l = 0, 2 and 4. Electrostatic simulations of the deformed
   bubble's internal electric field indicate that the applied field is
   enhanced by as much as a factor of 2.3 above the nominal applied field.
   Further simulation of both the pure l = 2 and l = 4 modes predicts that
   with additional deformation, the field enhancement factors could reach
   as much as 10-50.}},

Title = {{Multivariate Analyses of Amyloid-Beta Oligomer Populations Indicate a
   Connection between Pore Formation and Cytotoxicity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Aggregates of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides are thought to be involved
   in the development of Alzheimer's disease because they can change
   synaptic plasticity and induce neuronal cell death by inflammation,
   oxidative damage, and transmembrane pore formation. Exactly which
   oligomeric species underlie these cytotoxic effects remains unclear. The
   work presented here established well-controlled aggregation conditions
   of A beta(1-40) or A beta(1-42) peptides over a 20-day period and
   characterized these preparations with regard to their beta-sheet
   content, degree of fibril formation, relative abundance of various
   oligomer sizes, and propensity to induce membrane pore formation and
   cytotoxicity. Using this multivariate data set, a systematic and
   inherently unbiased partial least squares (PLS) approach showed that for
   both peptides the abundance of oligomers in the tetramer to 13-mer range
   contributed positively to both pore formation and cytotoxicity, while
   monomers, dimers, trimers, and the largest oligomers (>210 kDa) were
   negatively correlated to both phenomena. Multivariate PLS analysis is
   ideally suited to handle complex data sets and interdependent variables
   such as relative oligomer concentrations, making it possible to
   elucidate structure function relationships in complex mixtures. This
   approach, therefore, introduces an enabling tool to the field of amyloid
   research, in which it is often difficult to interpret the activity of
   individual species within a complex mixture of bioactive species.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving photoacoustic microscopic imaging through a miniaturized
   scanning head is a crucial step toward high-resolution photoacoustic
   endoscopy. In this work, we have developed a miniaturized probe head
   using a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based mirror for raster
   scan of the laser beam and our newly developed super broad bandwidth
   microring resonator based ultrasound detector for photoacoustic signal
   detection. Through this all-optical design, which offers unique
   advantages for endoscopic applications, this system is capable of
   three-dimensional (3D) imaging with high resolution of 17.5 mu m in
   lateral direction and 20 mu m in axial direction at a distance of 3.7
   mm. After the performance of this system was validated through the
   experiments on printed grids and a resolution test target, microscopic
   imaging of the 3D microvasculatures in canine bladders was also
   conducted successfully, demonstrating the potential of novel
   photoacoustic endoscopic in future clinical management of bladder
   cancer. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{We consider the thermodynamically driven self-assembly of spheres onto
   the surface of a central sphere. This assembly process forms
   self-limiting, or terminal, anisotropic clusters (N-clusters) with
   well-defined structures. We use Brownian dynamics to model the assembly
   of N-clusters varying in size from two to twelve outer spheres and free
   energy calculations to predict the expected cluster sizes and shapes as
   a function of temperature and inner particle diameter. We show that the
   arrangements of outer spheres at finite temperatures are related to
   spherical codes, an ideal mathematical sequence of points corresponding
   to the densest possible sphere packings. We demonstrate that temperature
   and the ratio of the diameters of the inner and outer spheres dictate
   cluster morphology. We present a surprising result for the equilibrium
   structure of a 5-cluster, for which the square pyramid arrangement is
   preferred over a more symmetric structure. We show this result using
   Brownian dynamics, a Monte Carlo simulation, and a free energy
   approximation. Our results suggest a promising way to assemble
   anisotropic building blocks from constituent colloidal spheres.}},

Title = {{The role of effluent nitrate in trace organic chemical oxidation during

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{5224-5234}},

Abstract = {{Most conventional biological treatment wastewater treatment plants
   (WWTPs) contain nitrate in the effluent. Nitrate undergoes photolysis
   when irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light in the 200-240 and 300-325
   nm wavelength range. In the process of nitrate photolysis, nitrite and
   hydroxyl radicals are produced. Medium pressure mercury lamps emitting a
   polychromatic UV spectrum including irradiation below 240 nm are
   becoming more common for wastewater disinfection. Therefore, nitrified
   effluent irradiated with polychromatic UV could effectively become a de
   facto advanced oxidation (hydroxyl radical) treatment process. UV-based
   advanced oxidation processes commonly rely on addition of hydrogen
   peroxide in the presence of UV irradiation for production of hydroxyl
   radicals. This study compares the steady-state concentration of hydroxyl
   radicals produced by nitrate contained in a conventional WWTP effluent
   to that produced by typical concentrations of hydrogen peroxide used for
   advanced oxidation treatment of water. The quantum yield of hydroxyl
   radical production from nitrate by all pathways was calculated to be
   0.24 +/- 0.03, and the quantum yield of hydroxyl radicals from nitrite
   was calculated to be 0.65 +/- 0.06. A model was developed that would
   estimate production of hydroxyl radicals directly from nitrate and water
   quality parameters. In effluents with >5 mg-N/L of nitrate, the
   concentration of hydroxyl radicals is comparable to that produced by
   addition of 10 mg/L of H2O2. Nitrifying wastewater treatment plants
   utilizing polychromatic UV systems at disinfection dose levels can be
   expected to achieve up to 30\% degradation of some micropollutants by
   hydroxyl radical oxidation. Increasing UV fluence to levels used during
   advanced oxidation could achieve over 95\% degradation of some
   compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Green's functions for the indentation of an elastic layer resting on
   or bonded to a rigid base by a line load are found efficiently and
   accurately by a combination of contour integration with a series
   expansion for small arguments. From the form of the equations it is
   clear that the function is oscillatory when the layer is free to slip
   over the base, but for the bonded layer, the function simply decays to
   zero after a single overshoot.
   The deformation due to pressure distributions of the form of the product
   of a polynomial with an elliptical ({''}Hertzian{''}) term is calculated
   and the coefficients chosen to match the indentation shape to that of a
   cylindrical indenter. The resulting pressure distributions behave much
   as in Johnson's approximate theory, becoming parabolic instead of
   elliptical as the ratio bid of contact width to layer thickness
   increases, or, for the bonded incompressible (v = 1/2) layer, becoming
   bell-shaped for very large bid.
   The relation between the approach (delta and the contact width b curves
   has been investigated, and some anomalies in published asymptotic
   equations noted and, perhaps, resolved.
   A noticeable feature of our method is that, unlike previous solutions in
   which the full mixed boundary value problem (given indenter shape /
   stress-free boundary) has been solved, the bonded incompressible solid
   causes no problems and is handled just as for lower values of Poisson's
   ratio. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), a member of the transforming
   growth factor superfamily, has been shown to have inhibitory effect on
   many tumor types. However, the effect of BMP-2 on human renal cell
   carcinoma (RCC) is still unknown. We previously showed that BMP-2
   inhibits tumorigenicity of cancer stem cells in human osteosarcoma
   OS99-1 cells. Our study investigates the effect of BMP-2 on human RCC
   using ACHN and Caki-2 cell lines. Three types of BMP receptors were
   found to be expressed in ACHN and Caki-2 cells. In vitro, BMP-2 was
   found to inhibit the growth of ACHN and Caki-2 cells. The
   antiproliferative effect seems to be due to cell cycle arrest in the G1
   phase, which was revealed by flow cytometry analysis. Using reverse
   transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis, we demonstrated BMP-2
   upregulated osteogenic markers Runx-2 and Collagen Type I gene
   expression in ACHN and Caki-2 cells. Treatment of ACHN and Caki-2 cells
   with BMP-2 induced a rapid phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. In vivo, all
   animals receiving low number of ACHN (1 x 104) and Caki-2 (5 x 104)
   cells treated with 30 mu g of BMP-2 per animal showed limited tumor
   growth with significant bone formation, whereas untreated cells
   developed large tumor masses without bone formation in immunodeficient
   non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice.
   These results suggest that BMP-2 inhibits growth of RCC as well as
   causes induction of osseous bone formation. Further research is needed
   to determine the relationship between inhibition of cell proliferation
   and bone induction.}},

Abstract = {{While contemporary prosthetic devices restore some function to
   individuals who have lost a limb, there are efforts to develop
   bio-integrated prostheses to improve functionality. A critical step in
   advancing this technology will be to securely attach the device to
   remnant bone. To investigate mechanisms for establishing robust implant
   fixation in bone while undergoing loading, we previously used a topology
   optimization scheme to develop optimized orthopedic implants and then
   fabricated selected designs from titanium (Ti)-alloy with selective
   laser sintering (SLS) technology. In the present study, we examined how
   implant architecture and mechanical stimulation influence
   osseointegration within an in vivo environment. To do this, we evaluated
   three implant designs (two optimized and one non-optimized) using a
   unique in vivo model that applied cyclic, tension/compression loads to
   the implants. Eighteen (six per implant design) adult male canines had
   implants surgically placed in their proximal, tibial metaphyses.
   Experimental duration was 12 weeks; daily loading (peak load of +/- 22 N
   for 1000 cycles) was applied to one of each animal's bilateral implants
   for the latter six weeks. Following harvest, osseointegration was
   assessed by non-destructive mechanical testing, micro-computed
   tomography (microCT) and back-scatter scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM). Data revealed that implant loading enhanced osseointegration by
   significantly increasing construct stiffness, peri-implant trabecular
   morphology, and percentages of interface connectivity and bone ingrowth.
   While this experiment did not demonstrate a clear advantage associated
   with the optimized implant designs, osseointegration was found to be
   significantly influenced by aspects of implant architecture. (C) 2012

   of the bilayer MoS2 monotonically decrease with an increasing vertical
   electric field. The critical electric fields, at which the
   semiconductor-to-metal transition occurs, are predicted to be in the
   range of 1.0-1.5 V/angstrom depending on different stacked
   conformations. Ab initio quantum transport simulations of a dual-gated

Abstract = {{A 35 x 3.5 x 4.6 mm(3) thick TlBr detector with pixellated Au/Cr anodes
   made by Radiation Monitoring Devices Inc. was studied. The detector has
   a planar cathode and nine anode pixels surrounded by a guard ring. The
   pixel pitch is 1.0 mm. Digital pulse waveforms of preamplifier outputs
   were recorded using a multi-channel GaGe PCI digitizer board. Several
   experiments were carried out at -20 degrees C, with the detector under
   bias for over a month. An energy resolution of 1.7\% FWHM at 662 key was
   measured without any correction at -2400 V bias. Holes generated at all
   depths can be collected by the cathode at -2400 V bias which made depth
   correction using the cathode-to-anode ratio technique difficult since
   both charge carriers contribute to the signal. An energy resolution of
   5.1\% FWHM at 662 keV was obtained from the best pixel electrode without
   depth correction at +1000V bias. In this positive bias case, the pixel
   electrode was actually collecting holes. A hole mobility-lifetime of
   0.95 x 10(-4) cm(2)/V has been estimated from measurement data. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents unique approaches to enable control and
   quantification of ultrasound-mediated cell membrane disruption, or
   sonoporation, at the single-cell level. Ultrasound excitation of
   microbubbles that were targeted to the plasma membrane of HEK-293 cells
   generated spatially and temporally controlled membrane disruption with
   high repeatability. Using whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with
   fluorescence microscopy, we obtained time-resolved measurements of
   single-cell sonoporation and quantified the size and resealing rate of
   pores. We measured the intracellular diffusion coefficient of
   cytoplasmic RNA/DNA from sonoporation-induced transport of an
   intercalating fluorescent dye into and within single cells. We achieved
   spatiotemporally controlled delivery with subcellular precision and
   calcium signaling in targeted cells by selective excitation of
   microbubbles. Finally, we utilized sonoporation to deliver calcein, a
   membrane-impermeant substrate of multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1),
   into HEK-MRP1 cells, which overexpress MRP1, and monitored the calcein
   efflux by MRP1. This approach made it possible to measure the efflux
   rate in individual cells and to compare it directly to the efflux rate
   in parental control cells that do not express MRP1.}},

   in InP for designing strip waveguides that interface InP photonic

   under an atomic layer deposited insulator layer in contrast to strip
   waveguides in silicon supported on insulator. We show a substantial
   improvement in optical transmission when using InP-SUI strip waveguides
   interfaced with localized photonic crystal membrane structures when
   compared with extended photonic crystal waveguide membranes.
   Furthermore, SUI makes available various fiber-coupling techniques used

Abstract = {{The dynamic axial crush response of circular cell polycarbonate
   honeycombs was studied for 3-cell and 7-cell specimens experimentally
   and through finite-element (FE) simulation. The experiments were
   conducted using two loading methods: (i) the wave loading device (WLD)
   method and (ii) the direct impact method (DIM). The specimens were
   subjected to crush velocities of about 12 000 mms(-1) in the WLD method
   and 5000 mms(-1) in the DIM. The two methods were used to obtain a
   fairly wide range of input velocities. The collapse sequence and
   displacement information of the specimens were captured using a
   high-speed camera. The mode of collapse was through progressive
   concertina-diamond fold formation over a fairly constant state of load,
   which is referred to as the crush load. The crushing was simulated using
   an explicit FE analysis using ABAQUS, with geometrically imperfect
   3-cell and 7-cell honeycomb models that incorporated the rate-dependent
   properties of polycarbonate. The FE results were found to agree well
   with the experimental results in terms of overall force-displacement
   plots, thus providing a basis to extract energy absorption estimates
   from the models and to draw comparisons between the 3-cell and 7-cell
   response behaviour. Moreover, the dynamic crush results were compared
   against a quasi-static axial crush response to demonstrate the presence
   of rate effects.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the
   solvation characteristics of neutral fullerene (C-60) and charged
   fulleride anion (C-60(5-)) in liquid ammonia. Potassium ions are present
   as counterions in the system containing fulleride ion. In addition to
   solvation characteristics, dynamical properties of solvation shells are
   also found out for both the neutral and anionic solutes. Our results
   reveal the presence of a rather large solvation shell of ammonia
   molecules around the C-60(5-) ion. It is found that the ammonia
   molecules are more closely packed in the first solvation shell of
   C-60(5-) than that of C-60. The distributions of ammonia molecules in
   the solvation shells of C-60 and C-60(5-) solutes together with hydrogen
   bonding characteristics of the solvent in different solvation shells are
   investigated. It is found that the solvation of the small counterions
   (K+) in liquid ammonia is affected very little by the presence of the
   large C-60(5-) anion. Regarding the dynamics of ammonia in solvation
   shells, it is found that the residence, translational and rotational
   dynamics of ammonia molecules differ significantly between the solvation
   shells of the neutral and charged fullerene solutes, especially in the
   first solvation shells. The average lifetimes of ammonia-ammonia
   hydrogen bonds are calculated from both continuous and intermittent
   hydrogen bond correlation functions. The calculations of binding
   energies reveal that the hydrogen bonds are weaker, hence short lived in
   the solvation shell of C-60(5-) compared to those in the solvation shell
   of neutral C-60 and also in bulk liquid ammonia. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{We propose a sustainable low temperature alternative, using
   supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)), to the conventional high
   temperature thermal annealing protocol for processing
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester
   (PC61BM) organic photovoltaic devices. This new strategy enabled the
   fabrication of devices that exhibited comparable, and often better,
   short circuit currents, J(SC)'s, and efficiencies than those prepared
   using the conventional heat treatment protocol. While the fill factors
   (FF) of devices processed using either of the prorocols were comparable,
   the best performing scCO(2) processed devices provided the largest
   J(SC)'s. With the use of energy-filtered transmission electron
   microscopy (EFTEM), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we
   show that the supercritical solvent protocol enabled the formation of
   similar macro- and nanoscale morphology as the heat treatment protocol.
   The active materials in the devices with the best efficiencies possessed
   purer P3HT and PC61BM phases, as shown by EFTEM/EELS. UV-vis
   measurements, moreover, corroborated this observation, revealing a
   higher average degree of packing and order of P3HT chains throughout the
   films. Conductive- and photoconductive-atomic force microscopy (cAFM and
   pcAFM) revealed that the higher efficiency devices possessed larger
   fractions of photoactive regions throughout the active material. The
   variations in photoconductivity are associated with changes in the local
   composition throughout the active material.}},

Abstract = {{We report a simple correlation between microstructure and
   strain-dependent elasticity in colloidal gels by visualizing the
   evolution of cluster structure in high strain-rate flows. We control the
   initial gel microstructure by inducing different levels of isotropic
   depletion attraction between particles suspended in refractive index
   matched solvents. Contrary to previous ideas from mode coupling and
   micromechanical treatments, our studies show that bond breakage occurs
   mainly due to the erosion of rigid clusters that persist far beyond the
   yield strain. This rigidity contributes to gel elasticity even when the
   sample is fully fluidized; the origin of the elasticity is the slow
   Brownian relaxation of rigid, hydrodynamically interacting clusters. We
   find a power-law scaling of the elastic modulus with the stress-bearing
   volume fraction that is valid over a range of volume fractions and
   gelation conditions. These results provide a conceptual framework to
   quantitatively connect the flow-induced microstructure of soft materials
   to their nonlinear rheology.}},

Abstract = {{Nature's particles, such as spores, viruses or cells, are adaptive-i.e.,
   they can rapidly alter major phenomenological attributes such as shape,
   size, or curvature in response to environmental changes. Prominent
   examples include the hydration-mediated opening of ice plant seeds,
   actuation of pine cones, or the ingenious snapping mechanism of
   predatory Venus flytraps that rely on concave-to-convex
   reconfigurations. In contrast, experimental realization of
   reconfigurable synthetic microparticles has been extremely challenging
   and only very few examples have been reported so far. Here, we
   demonstrate a generic approach towards dynamically reconfigurable
   microparticles that explores unique anisotropic particle architectures,
   rather than direct synthesis of sophisticated materials such as
   shape-memory polymers. Solely enabled by their architecture,
   multicompartmental microcylinders made of conventional polymers
   underwent active reconfiguration including shape-shifting, reversible
   switching, or three-way toggling. Once microcylinders with appropriate
   multicompartmental architectures were prepared by electrohydrodynamic
   cojetting, simple exposure to an external stimulus, such as ultrasound
   or an appropriate solvent, gives rise to interfacial stresses that
   ultimately cause reversible topographical reconfiguration. The broad
   versatility of the electrohydrodynamic cojetting process with respect to
   materials selection and processing suggests strategies for a wide range
   of dynamically reconfigurable adaptive materials including those with
   prospective applications for sensors, reprogrammable microactuators, or
   targeted drug delivery.}},

   Blisks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A novel reduced order modeling methodology to capture blade-to-blade
   variability in damping in blisks is presented. This new approach
   generalizes the concept of component mode mistuning (CMM), which was
   developed to capture stiffness and mass mistuning (and did not include
   variability in damping among the blades). This work focuses on modeling
   large variability in damping. Such variability is significant in many
   applications and particularly important for modeling damping coatings.
   Similar to the CMM based studies, structural damping is used to capture
   the damping effects due to the mechanical energy dissipation caused by
   internal friction within the blade material. The steady state harmonic
   responses of the blades are obtained using the novel reduced order
   modeling methodology and are validated by comparison with simulation
   results obtained using a full order model in ANSYS with a maximum
   amplitude error of 0.3\%. It is observed that there is no strong
   correlation between the engine order of excitation and both the
   variation in the response from blade to blade and the blade
   amplification factors. The effects of damping mistuning are studied
   statistically through Monte Carlo simulations. For this purpose, the
   blisk model is subjected to multiple traveling wave excitations. The
   uncertainty in the various mechanisms responsible for dissipation of
   energy and the uncontrollability of these dissipation mechanisms makes
   it difficult to assign a reliable value for the loss factor of each
   blade. Hence, large variations (up to +/- 80\%) in the structural
   damping coefficients of the blades are simulated. {[}DOI:

Title = {{Impact of Screencast Technology: Connecting the Perception of Usefulness
   and the Reality of Performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{101}},

Pages = {{717-737}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Prior research on the instructional use of screencasts (video of a
   computer screen output with realtime audio commentary) suggests that
   this technology is perceived by students as beneficial and results in
   improved course performance.
   PURPOSE
   This study explores how and why students use screencasts, as well as why
   some students choose not to use them. The study also investigates
   whether the perception that screencasts are helpful aligns with the
   reality of students' course performance.
   DESIGN/METHOD
   A quantitative study was conducted throughout two semesters in an
   undergraduate engineering survey course at a large public university.
   The investigation used a student perceptions survey and case study
   analysis to explore the connection between screencast use, the
   perception of having gained a deeper understanding of the course
   material based on this use, and actual course performance.
   RESULTS
   Findings indicate that students' preferred strategies for using
   screencasts are related to the frequency of use and the degree of
   understanding. Students who use the screencasts more and perceive them
   to have increased their understanding demonstrate increased competence
   on particular exam questions. Only those students who actively chose not
   to use screencasts (compared to those who forgot or ran out of time)
   show no detrimental effects on their performance.
   CONCLUSION
   Our findings highlight both the perceived and actual value of
   screencasting to students and the ways this technology is used. This
   research suggests that screencasting may promote self-efficacy among
   undergraduate engineering students.}},

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia
   in humans and is predicted to dramatically increase its prevalence in
   the future. There is experimental evidence that increasing stretch
   increases the dominance of the pulmonary veins (PVs) during AF in
   isolated hearts and ectopic activity in the isolated PVs, but the ionic
   mechanisms underlying such effects are not clear and the ability of the
   PVs to favorably host functional reentry during stretch cannot be
   excluded. We used a combination of endocardial-epicardial optical
   mapping with phase and spectral analysis to study stretch-related AF
   (SRAF) in normal isolated sheep hearts. We have found rapid AF sources
   in the posterior left atrium (PLA) and PV region and their activation
   frequency and level of organization correlated with intra-atrial
   pressure. Analysis of the surfaces' optical mapping data in the phase
   domain reveals that activation of the PLA consisted of alternating
   patterns of breakthroughs, reentries and relatively simple waves swiping
   across the mapped field. The patterns on the endocardial and epicardial
   PLA surface at any given moment of time of the SRAF could be either
   identical or not identical, and the activity in the thickness of the PLA
   wall is hypothesized to conform to either ectopic discharge or scroll
   waves, but a definite evidence for the presence of such mechanisms is
   currently lacking. Thus the understanding of the manner by which the
   mechano-electric feedback effects in the PLA, including the PVs, become
   important in the initiation and maintenance of AF requires further
   detailed investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A platform to parallelize planar surfaces and control their spatial

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Parallelizing planar surfaces and manipulating them into close proximity
   with spatial separation of nanoscale dimensions is critical for probing
   phenomena such as near-field radiative heat transport and Casimir
   forces. Here, we report on a novel platform, with an integrated
   reflected light microscope, that is capable of parallelizing two planar
   surfaces such that the angular deviation is <6 mu rad, while
   simultaneously allowing control of the gap from 15 mu m down to contact
   with similar to 0.15 nm resolution. The capabilities of this platform
   were verified by using two custom-fabricated micro-devices with planar
   surfaces, 60 x 60 mu m(2) each, whose flatness and surface roughness
   were experimentally quantified. We first parallelized the two
   micro-devices by using the developed platform in conjunction with a
   simple optical approach that relies on the shallow depth of field
   (similar to 2 mu m) of a long working distance microscope objective.
   Subsequently, we experimentally tested the parallelism achieved via the
   optical alignment procedure by taking advantage of electrodes integrated
   into the micro-devices. Our measurements unambiguously show that the
   simple depth-of-field based optical approach enables parallelization
   such that the angular deviation between the two surfaces is within
   similar to 500 mu rad. This ensures that the separation between any two
   corresponding points on the parallel surfaces deviate by similar to 30
   nm or less from the expected value. Further, we show that improved
   parallelization can be achieved using the integrated micro-electrodes
   which enable surface roughness limited parallelization with deviations
   of similar to 5 nm from parallelism. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) lacks cell binding sites and requires
   additional treatments such as a routine extracellular matrix coating
   process to culture cells on it. Here we propose a simple method to
   improve the cytophilicity of hydrosilylation cured PDMS elastomers by
   using boiling water: placing the crosslinked PDMS substrate in boiling
   deionized water for about 1 h generates hydroxyl groups on the surface
   derived from residual SiH functional groups present in the cured
   elastomers that act as good binding sites for cell attachment. Modified
   chemistry of the PDMS surface was confirmed by using attenuated total
   reflection infrared (ATR-IR) analysis. The beneficial biological effects
   were demonstrated through enhanced attachment/spreading of human
   mesenchymal stem cells on the boiling-treated surface of PDMS. The
   results show that boiling water treatment offers a mild, convenient, and
   cost-effective method to improve the surface cytophilicity of PDMS. (C)

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that rapamycin can induce regression of adenomatous
   polyposis coli (Apc) mutation-dependent colonic adenomas in genetically
   engineered mice (CPC;Apc). An endoscope was used to visualize adenomas
   in CPC; Apc mice weekly for 10 weeks. The lesion surface areas were
   measured using a distance gauge and digitally generated grid. Coronal
   scans were performed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to localize
   adenomas, and tumor volumes were measured from regions of interest drawn
   on consecutive axial scans. Rapamycin (5 mg/kg) was administered
   intraperitoneally daily for 5 weeks. Endoscopy and MRI were performed
   weekly to monitor adenoma regression. Caliper measurements and
   immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on adenomas postmortem.
   Dimensions from n = 30 adenomas in n = 7 animals were measured. Adenoma
   surface areas on endoscopy correlated with volumes on MRI and with
   postmortem caliper measurements, R-2 = 0.84 and R-2 = 0.81,
   respectively. The mean adenoma doubling times on endoscopy and MRI were
   0.95 +/- 0.14 and 1.21 +/- 0.16 weeks, respectively. The minimum
   detectable adenoma surface area and volume on endoscopy and MRI was 0.69
   mm(2) and 1.76 mm(3), respectively. On histology, the rapamycin-treated
   adenomas showed limited regions of dysplasia. Rapamycin therapy resulted
   in much lowermammalian target of rapamycin signaling and cell
   proliferation. Lower expression of phospho-S6 and reduced numbers of
   Ki67-positive cells were seen on IHC compared to vehicle-treated
   lesions. Endoscopy can be validated by MRI as a robust methodology for
   quantitative monitoring of therapy, representing a promising approach
   for future preclinical efforts to assess utility of novel colorectal
   cancer prevention strategies.}},

   comprehensive analysis of acoustically coupled thickness-mode AlN-on-Si

   The simulations are in good agreement with the measurements, allowing
   the optimization of filter characteristics. We analyze the filter
   response under varying geometric parameters and demonstrate that
   variations in the top electrode geometry allow the design of low-loss
   filters ( insertion loss <5 dB) with percentage bandwidth up to about
   1\% and ripple less than 1 dB.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio network where multiple
   heterogenous secondary users (SUs) compete for transmissions on idle
   primary channels. We model this as a singleton congestion game, where
   the probability for an SU to successfully access a channel decreases
   with the number of SUs selecting the same channel. In particular, we
   consider player-specific payoffs that depend not only on the shares of
   the channel but also on different preference constants. Such system can
   be modeled as a congestion game, and we study the price of anarchy (PoA)
   for four families of such a game: identical, player-specific symmetric,
   resource-specific symmetric, and asymmetric games. We characterize the
   worst-case PoA in terms of the number of SUs and channels, and
   illustrate the network scenarios under which the worse case performance
   is reached. We further illustrate the PoA results with two Medium Access
   Control (MAC) schemes: uniform MAC and slotted Aloha. For both cases, we
   observe that the average performance of the game equilibrium is better
   than the worst-case PoA. Our study sheds light on how to design stable
   systems with smaller efficiency loss of the equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{Utilization of unique properties of nanoscale graphene in macroscale
   materials requires a thoughtful selection of processing method(s). Here
   we review different materials assembly techniques which result in
   layered composite reminiscent of many biomaterials with the focus on
   layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly, vacuum-assisted flocculation (VAF), and
   others. Critical evaluation of LBL and its comparison to other
   solution-based methods of materials assembly using the abundant
   experimental data with graphene and graphene oxide is the main essence
   of this review. We compare several fundamental characteristics and
   applications being discussed for graphene-based material such as
   transparent conducting films, field effect transistors, lithium ion
   batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, sensors and polymer
   nanocomposites, highlighting the strengths, the weaknesses, and expected
   points of further developments of different techniques. The principle
   goal to be achieved in the future is to define much better effective
   implementation of layer-by-layer assembly and other techniques resulting
   in layered composites taking into account potential technological areas

Title = {{Which Lower Limb Frontal Plane Sensory and Motor Functions Predict Gait
   Speed and Efficiency on Uneven Surfaces in Older Persons With Diabetic

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify which frontal plane lower limb sensorimotor
   functions predict gait speed and efficiency (step-width-to-step-length
   ratio) on an uneven surface.
   Design: Cross-sectional observational study.
   Setting: A biomechanics research laboratory.
   Participants: Thirty-three subjects (14 women {[}42.4\%]; 21 with
   diabetic distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy {[}63.6\%]), with a
   spectrum of lower limb sensorimotor functions that ranged from normal to
   marked diabetic neuropathy.
   Methods: Independent variables included ankle inversion-eversion
   proprioceptive thresholds, and normalized measures of maximum voluntary
   strength and maximum rate of torque development (RTD) of hip
   abduction-adduction and ankle inversion-eversion. Kinematic data were
   obtained by using an optoelectronic system as subjects walked over an
   uneven 10-m surface.
   Main Outcome Measures: Dependent variables included gait speed and
   efficiency (determined by step-width-to-step-length ratio) on an uneven
   surface.
   Results: Hip adduction RTD and ankle inversion RTD predicted 54\% of
   gait speed, with the former predicting the majority (44\%). Ankle
   inversion RTD was the only significant predictor of gait efficiency,
   which accounted for 46\% of its variability. Age did not predict gait
   speed or efficiency.
   Conclusions: The rapid generation of strength in the frontal plane at
   the hip and ankle is responsible for the successful negotiation of
   irregular surfaces in older persons. Age demonstrated no independent
   influence. Training regimens in older persons should include maneuvers
   that rapidly develop strength in hip adductors and ankle invertors if
   navigation of uneven surfaces is a functional goal. PM R 2012;4:726-733}},

Abstract = {{Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (RR-P3HT) is a widely used donor
   material for bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. While much is
   known about the structure and properties of RR-P3HT films, important
   questions regarding hole mobilities in this material remain unresolved.
   Measurements of the out-of-plane hole mobilities, mu, of RR-P3HT films
   have been restricted to films in the thickness regime on the order of
   micrometers, beyond that generally used in solar cells, where the film
   thicknesses are typically 100 to 200 nm. Studies of in-plane carrier
   mobilities have been conducted in thinner films, in the thickness range
   100-200 nm. However, the in-plane and out-of-plane hole mobilities in
   RR-P3HT can be significantly different. We show here that the
   out-of-plane hole mobilities in neat RR-P3HT films increase by an order
   of magnitude, from 10(-4) cm(2)/V.s, for a 80 nm thick film, to a value
   of 10(-3) cm(2)/V.s for films thicker than 700 nm. Through a combination
   of morphological characterization and simulations, we show that the
   thickness dependent mobilities are not only associated with the
   differences between the average morphologies of thick films and thin
   films, but specifically associated with changes in the local morphology
   of films as a function of distance from the interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a novel discrete chaotic map named zigzag
   map that demonstrates excellent chaotic behaviors and can be utilized in
   truly random number generators (TRNGs). We comprehensively investigate
   the map and explore its critical chaotic characteristics and parameters.
   We further present two circuit implementations for the zigzag map based
   on the switched current technique as well as the current-mode affine
   interpolation of the breakpoints. In practice, implementation variations
   can deteriorate the quality of the output sequence as a result of
   variation of the chaotic map parameters. In order to quantify the impact
   of variations on the map performance, we model the variations using a
   combination of theoretical analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations on the
   circuits. We demonstrate that even in the presence of the map
   variations, a TRNG based on the zigzag map passes all of the NIST 800-22
   statistical randomness tests using simple post processing of the output

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce and analyze the properties of a class of
   games, the atomic congestion games on graphs (ACGGs), which is a
   generalization of the classical congestion games. In particular, an ACGG
   captures the spatial information that is often ignored in a classical
   congestion game. This is useful in many networking problems, e.g.,
   wireless networks where interference among the users heavily depends on
   the spatial information. In an ACGG, a player's payoff for using a
   resource is a function of the number of players who interact with it and
   use the same resource. Such spatial information can be captured by a
   graph. We study fundamental properties of the ACGGs: under what
   conditions these games possess a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PNE),
   or the finite improvement property (FIP), which is sufficient for the
   existence of a PNE. We show that a PNE may not exist in general, but
   that it does exist in many important special cases including tree, loop,
   or regular bipartite networks. The FIP holds for important special cases
   including systems with two resources or identical payoff functions for
   each resource. Finally, we present two wireless network applications of
   ACGGs: power control and channel contention under IEEE 802.11.}},

Abstract = {{In this series of two papers, we present our research on intelligent
   energy management for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). These two papers
   cover the modeling of power flow in HEVs, the mathematical background of
   optimization in energy management in HEVs, a machine learning framework
   that combines dynamic programming (DP) with machine learning to learn
   about roadway-type-and traffic-congestion-level-specific energy
   optimization, machine learning algorithms, and real-time quasi-optimal
   control of energy flow in an HEV. This first paper presents our research
   on machine learning for optimal energy management in HEVs. We will
   present a machine learning framework ML\_EMO\_HEV developed for the
   optimization of energy management in an HEV, machine learning algorithms
   for predicting driving environments, and the generation of an optimal
   power split for a given driving environment. Experiments are conducted
   based on a simulated Ford Escape Hybrid vehicle model provided by
   Argonne National Laboratory's Powertrain Systems Analysis Toolkit
   (PSAT). Based on the experimental results on the test data, we can
   conclude that the neural networks trained under the ML\_EMO\_HEV
   framework are effective in predicting roadway type and traffic
   congestion levels, predicting driving trends, and learning optimal
   engine speed and optimal battery power from DP.}},

Title = {{Prius(+) and Volt(-): Configuration Analysis of Power-Split Hybrid
   Vehicles With a Single Planetary Gear}},

Abstract = {{The majority of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) available on the market
   are power-split hybrid vehicles with a single planetary gear (PG),
   including the popular Toyota Prius and Chevy Volt. Although both
   vehicles use a single PG, they have different configurations with
   different numbers of operating modes. The Prius has no clutch and has a
   single operating mode, whereas the Chevy Volt uses three clutches and
   has four modes. The goal of this paper is to present a thorough analysis
   of all possible configurations of power-split hybrid powertrain using a
   single PG. The analysis includes the following steps: 1) search for all
   possible ways to connect powertrain elements to the PG; 2) identify all
   potential locations for clutch installations around the PG and examine
   the feasibility of additional operating modes introduced by the clutch
   installation; and 3) optimize fuel economy for performance comparison.
   The proposed analysis shows that a single PG can produce 12 different
   configurations, each of which can have four feasible operating modes by
   adding three clutches to the PG. In case studies, we focus on the two
   configurations that are used in the Prius and Volt to find the impact of
   adding (or removing) clutches and modes on their fuel economy
   performance. Our results show that adding one clutch to the Prius
   transmission (which is named ``Prius(+){''}) can significantly improve
   fuel economy in urban driving, whereas removing two clutches from the
   Volt transmission ({''}Volt(-){''}) will not significantly affect fuel
   economy in both urban and highway driving. This multimode configuration
   analysis can be used to systematically design future power-split HEVs.}},

Abstract = {{Gold (Au) supported on CeO2-Fe2O3 catalysts prepared by the
   deposition-coprecipitation technique were investigated for steam
   reforming of methanol (SRM). The 3 wt\% Au/CeO2-Fe2O3 sample calcined at
   400 degrees C achieved 100\% methanol conversion and 74\% hydrogen yield
   due to a strong Ce-Fe interaction in the active solid solution phase,
   CexFe1-xO2. The sintering of Au particles was observed when the highest
   metal content of 5 wt\% was registered, which worsened the SRM activity.
   According to the TPR and TPO analysis, it was found that the
   transformation of the alpha-Fe2O3 structure in the mixed oxides and the
   coke deposition were the main factors for the rapid deactivation of the
   catalyst. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{We present nonlinear phenomena produced from spoof surface plasmon
   polariton (SSPP) modes. Below the THz spectrum, artificially textured
   conducting metastructures on a subwavelength scale generate
   surface-bound modes and are called SSPP modes, similar to surface
   plasmon polariton (SPP) modes in the visible spectrum. Even though
   nonlinear effects in the THz domain are negligible, subwavelength
   metallic gap structures are ideal candidates to realize nonlinear
   behavior in the THz domain because of slow light propagation, strong
   electromagnetic confinement, and a high quality factor Q. In particular,
   when SSPP structures are combined with Kerr nonlinear materials,
   nonlinear-bistable curves can be observed below the THz spectrum. (C)

Title = {{Static NBTI Reduction Using Internal Node Control}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) is a significant
   reliability concern for nanoscale CMOS circuits. Its effects on circuit
   timing can be especially pronounced for circuits with standby-mode
   equipped functional units, because these units can be subjected to
   static NBTI stress for extended periods of time. This article describes
   Internal Node Control (INC), in which the inputs to some individual
   gates are directly manipulated to prevent this static NBTI fatigue. We
   prove that the INC selection problem is NP-complete and present a
   linear-time heuristic that can quickly determine near-optimal
   placements. This near-optimality is confirmed by comparing results for
   small benchmarks against optimal solutions from a mixed integer linear
   programming formulation of our problem. We evaluate the heuristic on the
   ISCAS85 benchmarks and the Synopsys DesignWare Library. Our heuristic
   reduces static NBTI-induced delay over a ten year period by 30-60\% and
   can reduce total path delay by an average 9.4\% when NBTI degradation is
   severe. The INC placements and sleep signal routing require only a 1.6\%
   increase in area.}},

Title = {{Concurrent Design Optimization and Calibration-Based Validation Using

Abstract = {{The design optimization process relies often on computational models for
   analysis or simulation. These models must be validated to quantify the
   expected accuracy of the obtained design solutions. It can be argued
   that validation of computational models in the entire design space is
   neither affordable nor required. In previous work, motivated by the fact
   that most numerical optimization algorithms generate a sequence of
   candidate designs, we proposed a new paradigm where design optimization
   and calibration-based model validation are performed concurrently in a
   sequence of variable-size local domains that are relatively small
   compared to the entire design space. A key element of this approach is
   how to account for variability in test data and model predictions in
   order to determine the size of the local domains at each stage of the
   sequential design optimization process. In this article, we discuss two
   alternative techniques for accomplishing this: parametric and
   nonparametric bootstrapping. The parametric bootstrapping assumes a
   Gaussian distribution for the error between test and model data and uses
   maximum likelihood estimation to calibrate the prediction model. The
   nonparametric bootstrapping does not rely on the Gaussian assumption
   providing; therefore, a more general way to size the local domains for
   applications where distributional assumptions are difficult to verify,
   or not met at all. If distribution assumptions are met, parametric
   methods are preferable over nonparametric methods. We use a validation
   literature benchmark problem to demonstrate the application of the two
   techniques. Which technique to use depends on whether the Gaussian
   distribution assumption is appropriate based on available information.

Abstract = {{Fuel economy has been an effective indicator of vehicle greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions for conventional gasoline-powered vehicles due to the
   strong relationship between fuel economy and vehicle life cycle
   emissions. However, fuel economy is not as accurate an indicator of
   vehicle GHG emissions for plug-in hybrid (PHEVs) and pure battery
   electric vehicles (EVs). Current vehicle labeling efforts by the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Transportation
   have been focused on providing energy and environmental information to
   consumers based on U.S. national average data. This article explores the
   effects of variations in regional grids and regional daily vehicle miles
   traveled (VMT) on the total vehicle life cycle energy and GHG emissions
   of electrified vehicles and compare these results with information
   reported on the label and on the EPA's fuel economy Web site. The model
   results suggest that only 25\% of the life cycle emissions from a
   representative PHEV are reflected on current vehicle labeling. The
   results show great variation in total vehicle life cycle emissions due
   to regional grid differences, including an approximately 100 gram per
   mile life cycle GHG emissions difference between the lowest and highest
   electric grid regions and up to a 100\% difference between the
   state-specific emission values within the same electric grid regions.
   Unexpectedly, for two regional grids the life cycle GHG emissions were
   higher in electric mode than in gasoline mode. We recommend that labels
   include stronger language on their deficiencies and provide ranges for
   GHG emissions from vehicle charging in regional electricity grids to
   better inform consumers.}},

Abstract = {{The fluxes of radicals and ions to the wafer during plasma processing of
   microelectronics devices determine the quality of the etch or
   deposition. These fluxes are largely controlled by controlling the
   electron energy distribution function f (epsilon) which determines the
   dissociation patterns of feedstock gases. In quasi-steady state
   operation, an equilibrium condition for f (epsilon) results from a real
   time balance between electron sources and sinks. Using pulsed power,
   electron sources and sinks do not need to instantaneously balance-they
   only need to balance over the longer pulse period. This provides
   additional leverage to customize f (epsilon). In this paper, the f
   (epsilon) in a two-frequency, pulsed capacitively coupled plasma
   sustained in Ar and Ar/CF4/O-2 mixtures are discussed with results from
   a two-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model. The f (epsilon) are
   obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation which includes electron-electron
   collisions. We found that the f (epsilon) and rate coefficients can be
   controlled by pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and duty cycle (DC) of
   the pulsed power in a manner not otherwise easily attainable using
   continuous excitation. The tail of the f (epsilon) is enhanced with
   smaller PRF and DC in order to compensate for the electron losses during
   the power-off portion of the cycle.}},

Title = {{Drained response of municipal solid waste in large-scale triaxial shear
   testing}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1873-1885}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive laboratory investigation was performed on municipal
   solid waste (MSW) from a landfill located in northern California using a
   large-scale triaxial (TX) apparatus. An improved, standardized waste
   specimen preparation method was developed and used to prepare 27
   large-scale TX specimens (d = 300 mm, h = 600-630 mm). The effects of
   waste composition, confining stress, unit weight, loading rate, and
   stress path on the drained stress-strain response of MSW were
   investigated. Waste composition has a significant effect on its
   stress-strain response. The commonly observed upward curvature of the
   stress-strain response of specimens composed of larger-sized waste
   materials results from the fibrous constituents (primarily paper,
   plastic and wood) reinforcing the waste matrix. This effect is greatest
   when the MSW specimen is sheared across the long axis of the fibrous
   particles. Due to this significant strain hardening effect and waste's
   in situ stress state, a limiting strain failure criterion of 5\% axial
   strain from the K-o field consolidation state is judged to be most
   appropriate. Results from this test program and data from the literature
   indicate that the TX compression secant friction angle of MSW varies
   from 34 to 44, with 39 as a best estimate, at a confining stress of one
   atmosphere (assuming c = 0). The friction angle decreases as confining
   stress increases. The friction angles measured in this testing program
   are representative of failure surfaces that are oriented at an angle to
   the predominant orientation of the long axis of the fibrous waste
   particles. These friction angles are higher than those obtained in
   direct shear tests where shearing typically occurs parallel to the
   orientation of the fibrous waste particles. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Signal distortion from microelectrodes in clinical EEG acquisition
   systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Many centers are now using high-density microelectrodes during
   traditional intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) both for research
   and clinical purposes. These microelectrodes are FDA-approved and
   integrate into clinical EEG acquisition systems. However, the electrical
   characteristics of these electrodes are poorly described and clinical
   systems were not designed to use them; thus, it is possible that this
   shift into clinical practice could have unintended consequences. In this
   study, we characterized the impedance of over 100 commercial macro-and
   microelectrodes using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to
   determine how electrode properties could affect signal acquisition and
   interpretation. The EIS data were combined with the published
   specifications of several commercial EEG systems to design digital
   filters that mimic the behavior of the electrodes and amplifiers. These
   filters were used to analyze simulated brain signals that contain a
   mixture of characteristic features commonly observed in iEEG. Each
   output was then processed with several common quantitative EEG
   measurements. Our results show that traditional macroelectrodes had low
   impedances and produced negligible distortion of the original signal.
   Brain tissue and electrical wiring also had negligible filtering
   effects. However, microelectrode impedances were much higher and more
   variable than the macroelectrodes. When connected to clinical
   amplifiers, higher impedance electrodes produced considerable distortion
   of the signal at low frequencies (<60 Hz), which caused significant
   changes in amplitude, phase, variance and spectral band power. In
   contrast, there were only minimal changes to the signal content for
   frequencies above 100 Hz. In order to minimize distortion with
   microelectrodes, we determined that an acquisition system should have an
   input impedance of at least 1 G Omega, which is much higher than most
   clinical systems. These results show that it is critical to account for
   variations in impedance when analyzing EEG from different-sized
   electrodes. Data from microelectrodes may yield misleading results
   unless recorded with high-impedance amplifiers.}},

Abstract = {{Myelin basic protein (MBP) is an important component of the myelin
   sheath surrounding neurons, and it is directly affected in demyelinating
   diseases. MBP contains a relatively large number of post-translational
   modifications (PTMs), which have been reported to play a role in
   multiple sclerosis, while MBPs from lower vertebrates have been reported
   to be incapable of inducing multiple sclerosis or allergic encephalitis.
   This study reveals the extent of differences in PTM patterns for
   mammalian and nonmammalian MBPs. This included intact mass and de novo
   sequence analysis of approximately 85\% of rattlesnake MBP, the first
   reptile MBP to be characterized, and of bovine MBP. We identified 12
   PTMs at 11 sites in the five bovine MBP charge components, which include
   both previously reported and novel modifications. The most notable
   modification is an acetylation of lysine 121. Other modifications found
   in bovine MBP include N-terminal acetylation in components C1, C2, and
   C3; oxidation of methionine 19 in all five components; all charge
   isomers having both a mono- and dimethylated (symmetric) arginine at
   position 106; deimination in arginines 23 and 47 found only in component
   C8b; deimination of arginine 96 and deamidation in glutamine 102 found
   in components C2, C3, C8a, and C8b; phosphorylation in threonine 97
   restricted to charge components C2 and C3; deimination in arginine 161
   only found in component C3; deamidation of glutamine 120 was only
   observed in C3. All four deiminated arginines and one acetylated lysine
   were first experimentally revealed in this study for bovine MBP. Mascot
   database searching combined with de novo sequence analysis of
   rattlesnake MBP provided more than 85\% sequence coverage. A few PTMs
   were also revealed in rattlesnake MBP: mono- and dimethylated Arg,
   protein N-terminal acetylation, and deiminated Arg. Overall, snake MBP
   was found to undergo less modification than bovine MBP on the basis of
   the mass heterogeneity of the intact protein, the bottom-up structure
   analysis, and the limited complexity of rattlesnake MBP chromatography.
   The combined data from this study and information from previous studies
   extend the known MBP PTMs, and PTMs unique to higher vertebrates are
   proposed.}},

   so as to reduce balance of systems costs and open new applications for
   conformable solar cell arrays on a variety of surfaces. Detailed studies
   on the optical and electrical properties of the resulting solar cells
   suggest that both antireflective and light-trapping mechanisms are key

Abstract = {{Data on the strength of the utero-placental interface (UPI) would help
   improve understanding of the mechanisms of placental abruption
   (premature separation of the placenta from the uterus) during
   motor-vehicle crashes involving pregnant occupants. An ovine model was
   selected for study because like the human, its placenta has a villous
   attachment structure.
   Uteri with intact placentas were obtained from three sheep as
   by-products of another research study. The samples were harvested
   between 102 and 119 days of the 145-day gestational period. Rectangular
   specimens with areas measuring 15 mm x 5 mm were cut through the
   thickness of the placenta and uterus. Each subject provided eight
   samples, of which four were tested at a nominal strain rate of 0.10
   strains/sec and the remainder was tested at a nominal strain rate of 1.0
   strains/sec. Sutures were used to secure the uterine side of the
   specimens to the test fixture, while mechanical clamps were used to
   attach the placenta side. A FARO arm scanner recorded the initial
   geometry of the tissue, and a random dot pattern applied to the placenta
   and uterus tissue allowed visualization of displacement.
   For the structure of the UPI, mean tensile failure strain and standard
   deviations are 0.37 (0.11) and 0.37 (0.18) for the 0.10 and 1.0 strain
   rates, respectively (p-value = 0.970) while the associated failure
   stresses are 6.5 (1.37) and 15.0 (5.08) kPa, (p-value = 0.064). The
   results from sheep UPI testing provide the first estimate of the human
   UPI structural failure tolerance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Artificial piezoelectric grass for energy harvesting from
   turbulence-induced vibration}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The primary objective of this research is to develop a deploy-and-forget
   energy harvesting device for use in low-velocity, highly turbulent fluid
   flow environments i.e. streams or ventilation systems. The work
   presented here focuses on a novel, lightweight, highly robust, energy
   harvester design referred to as piezoelectric grass. This biologically
   inspired design consists of an array of cantilevers, each constructed
   with piezoelectric material. When exposed to proper turbulent flow
   conditions, these cantilevers experience vigorous vibrations.
   Preliminary results have shown that a small array of piezoelectric grass
   was able to produce up to 1.0 mW per cantilever in high-intensity
   turbulent flow having a mean velocity of 11.5 m s(-1). According to the
   literature, this is among the highest output achieved using similar
   harvesting methods. A distributed parameter model for energy harvesting
   from turbulence-induced vibration will be introduced and experimentally
   validated. This model is generalized for the case of a single cantilever
   in turbulent cross-flow. Two high-sensitivity pressure probes were
   needed to perform spectral measurements within various turbulent flows.
   The design and performance of these probes along with calibration and
   measurement techniques will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in increasing the sustainability of water management is leading
   to a reevaluation of domestic wastewater (DWW) treatment practices. A
   central goal is to reduce energy demands and environmental impacts while
   recovering resources. Anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) have the
   ability to produce a similar quality effluent to aerobic treatment,
   while generating useful energy and producing substantially less
   residuals. This review focuses on operational considerations that
   require further research to allow implementation of AnMBR DWW treatment.
   Specific topics include membrane fouling, the lower limits of hydraulic
   retention time and temperature allowing for adequate treatment,
   complications with methane recovery, and nutrient removal options. Based
   on the current literature, future research efforts should focus on
   increasing the likelihood of net energy recovery through advancements in
   fouling control and development of efficient methods for dissolved
   methane recovery. Furthermore, assessing the sustainability of AnMBR
   treatment requires establishment of a quantitative environmental and
   economic evaluation framework. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the representative volume element (RVE) size (in terms
   of fiber packing and number of fibers for a given fiber-volume fraction)
   on the residual stresses created during the curing process of a
   continuous fiber-reinforced polymer matrix tow is investigated with the
   ultimate goal of finding a minimum unit cell size that can be used later
   for a homogenization procedure to calculate the response of woven fiber
   textile composites and in particular, fiber tows. A novel network curing
   model for the solidification of epoxy is used to model the curing
   process. The model takes into account heat conduction, cure kinetics and
   the creation of networks in a continuously shape changing body. The
   model is applied to the curing of a fiber/matrix RVE. The results for
   the minimum size of the RVE, obtained on the basis of the curing
   problem, are compared with a similar RVE, modeled as an elastic-plastic
   solid subjected to external loads, in order to compare the minimum RVE
   sizes obtained on the basis of different boundary value problem
   solutions.}},

Title = {{Extended smoothed boundary method for solving partial differential
   equations with general boundary conditions on complex boundaries}},
Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe an approach for solving partial differential
   equations with general boundary conditions imposed on arbitrarily shaped
   boundaries. A continuous function, the domain parameter, is used to
   modify the original differential equations such that the equations are
   solved in the region where a domain parameter takes a specified value
   while boundary conditions are imposed on the region where the value of
   the domain parameter varies smoothly across a short distance. The
   mathematical derivations are straightforward and applicable to a wide
   variety of partial differential equations. To demonstrate the general
   applicability of the approach, we provide four examples herein: (1) the
   diffusion equation with both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions;
   (2) the diffusion equation with both surface diffusion and reaction; (3)
   the mechanical equilibrium equation; and (4) the equation for phase
   transformation with the presence of additional boundaries. The solutions
   for several of these cases are validated against numerical solutions of
   the corresponding sharp-interface equations. The potential of the
   approach is demonstrated with five applications:
   surface-reaction-diffusion kinetics with a complex geometry,
   Kirkendall-effect-induced deformation, thermal stress in a complex
   geometry, phase transformations affected by substrate surfaces and
   relaxation of a droplet on irregular surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the University of Michigan Dioxin Exposure Study, soil,
   household dust, and serum samples were collected from more than 750
   households in five populations around the city of Midland and in Jackson
   and Calhoun Counties, Michigan, USA. Polytopic vector analysis, a type
   of receptor model, was applied to better understand the potential
   sources of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated
   dibenzofurans found in these samples and to quantify the contributions
   of the sources in each matrix across populations. The results indicated
   that source signatures found in soil are similar to those found in dust,
   reflecting various combustion profiles, pentachlorophenol, and graphite
   electrode sludge. The profiles associated with contamination in the
   Tittabawassee River, likely related to historical discharges from the
   Dow Chemical Company facility in Midland, exhibited the largest
   differences among the regional populations sampled. Differences in serum
   source contributions among the study populations were consistent with
   some of the regional differences observed in soil samples. However, the
   age trends of these differences suggested that they are related to past
   exposures, rather than ongoing sources. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012;

Abstract = {{It has been shown that torso-based vibrotactile feedback significantly
   reduces postural sway in balance-compromised adults during quiet
   standing and in response to perturbations. This study aimed to determine
   whether vibrotactile stimulations applied to different torso locations
   induced directional postural responses and whether torso cutaneous
   information contributes to body representation. Eleven healthy young
   adults equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed on the
   torso were asked to maintain an upright posture with closed eyes. Six
   vibrators (tactors) were placed on the torso in contact with the skin
   over the left and right external oblique, internal oblique, and erector
   spinae muscles at the L4/L5 level. Each tactor was randomly activated
   four times per location at a frequency of 250 Hz for a period of 5 s.
   The IMU results indicated that vibration applied individually over the
   internal oblique and erector spinae muscles induced a postural shift of
   about one degree oriented in the direction of the stimulation, while
   simultaneous activation of all tactors and activation of tactors over
   external oblique muscles produced insignificant postural effects. The
   root mean square of the sway signal was significantly higher during
   vibration than before or after. However, the center of pressure
   displacement, measured by a force plate, was uninfluenced by any
   vibration. These results suggest a multi-joint postural response
   including a torso inclination associated with vibration-induced changes
   in cutaneous information. The directional aspect of vibration-induced
   postural shifts suggests that cutaneous information from the stimulated
   areas contributes to proprioception and upper body spatial
   representation.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note develops a novel robust control algorithm for linear
   systems subject to additive and bounded disturbances. The approach is
   based on the constraint tightening method. While this problem can be
   tackled using existing robust model predictive control techniques, the
   proposed method has an advantage in that it is computationally efficient
   and avoids the need to solve repeatedly an online optimization problem,
   while the optimization problem solved at initialization is a simple
   linear programming problem. The algorithm elaborated in this technical
   note guarantees convergence to a minimal disturbance invariant set, and
   the terminal predicted state constraint set is allowed to be larger than
   the minimal disturbance invariant set. As an illustration, the developed
   algorithm is applied to constrained roll control of a ship operating in
   a wave field. Simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces
   the ship roll motion while the input and dynamic stall constraints are
   satisfied.}},

Abstract = {{Iterative image reconstruction can dramatically improve the image
   quality in X-ray computed tomography (CT), but the computation involves
   iterative steps of 3D forward- and back-projection, which impedes
   routine clinical use. To accelerate forward-projection, we analyze the
   CT geometry to identify the intrinsic parallelism and data access
   sequence for a highly parallel hardware architecture. To improve the
   efficiency of this architecture, we propose a water-filling buffer to
   remove pipeline stalls, and an out-of-order sectored processing to
   reduce the off-chip memory access by up to three orders of magnitude. We
   make a floating-point to fixed-point conversion based on numerical
   simulations and demonstrate comparable image quality at a much lower
   implementation cost. As a proof of concept, a 5-stage fully pipelined,
   55-way parallel separable-footprint forward-projector is prototyped on a
   Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA for a throughput of 925.8 million voxel
   projections/s at 200 MHz clock frequency, 4.6 times higher than an
   optimized 16-threaded program running on an 8-core 2.8-GHz CPU. A
   similar architecture can be applied to back-projection for a complete
   iterative image reconstruction system. The proposed algorithm and
   architecture can also be applied to hardware platforms such as graphics
   processing unit and digital signal processor to achieve significant
   accelerations.}},

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring thermal stratification significantly impacts the
   characteristics of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI)
   combustion. The in-cylinder gas temperature distributions prior to
   combustion dictate the ignition phasing, burn rates, combustion
   efficiency, and unburned hydrocarbon and CO emissions associated with
   HCCI operation. Characterizing the gas temperature fields in an HCCI
   engine and correlating them to HCCI burn rates is a prerequisite for
   developing strategies to expand the HCCI operating range. To study the
   development of thermal stratification in more detail, a new analysis
   methodology for postprocessing experimental HCCI engine data is
   proposed. This analysis tool uses the autoignition integral in the
   context of the mass fraction burned curve to infer information about the
   distribution of temperature that exists in the cylinder prior to
   combustion. An assumption is made about the shape of the charge
   temperature profiles of the unburned gas during compression and after
   combustion starts elsewhere in the cylinder. Second, it is assumed that
   chemical reaction rates proceed very rapidly in comparison to the
   staggering of ignition phasing from thermal stratification. The
   autoignition integral is then coupled to the mass fraction burned curve
   to produce temperature-mass distributions that are representative of a
   particular combustion event. Due to the computational efficiency
   associated with this zero-dimensional calculation, a large number of
   zones can be simulated at very little computational expense. The
   temperature-mass distributions are then studied over a coolant
   temperature sweep. The results show that very small changes to
   compression heat transfer can shift the distribution of mass and
   temperature in the cylinder enough to significantly affect HCCI burn
   rates and emissions. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007010]}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a thermal transpiration-driven multistage Knudsen
   pump for vacuum pumping applications. This type of pump relies upon the
   motion of gas molecules from the cold end to the hot end of a channel in
   which the flow is restricted to the free molecular or transitional
   regimes. To achieve a high compression ratio, 48 stages are cascaded in
   series in a single chip. A five-mask, single silicon wafer process is
   used for monolithic integration of the designed Knudsen pump. The pump
   has several monolithically integrated Pirani gauges to experimentally
   measure the vacuum pumping characteristics of the pump. It has a
   footprint of 10.35 x 11.45 mm(2). For an input power of 1350 mW, the
   fabricated pump self-evacuates the encapsulated cavities from 760 to
   approximate to 50 Torr, resulting in a compression ratio of 15. It also
   pumps down from 250 to approximate to 5 Torr, resulting in a compression
   ratio of 50. Each integrated Pirani gauge requires approximate to 3.9 mW
   of power consumption, and its response is sufficiently sensitive in the
   operating pressure range of 760-1 Torr.}},

Abstract = {{The Kirkendall effect stems from the imbalance of atomic diffusion
   fluxes in a crystalline solid. Vacancy generation and annihilation,
   which compensate for the unbalanced fluxes, result in deformation that
   is experimentally observed as the motion of fiducial markers in a
   diffusion couple that can be approximated as a one-dimensional system.
   In multiple dimensions, such deformation occurs along both the
   directions parallel to and normal to the primary diffusion direction. In
   this article, we present a model that couples unbalanced interdiffusion
   and the resulting plastic deformation. One- and two-dimensional
   simulations are conducted with the analytically calculated diffusion
   coefficients of a thermodynamically ideal random alloy; the result shows
   that the ratio of the diffusion fluxes of the atomic species equals the
   ratio of atomic hop frequencies, which leads to the final volume ratio
   also given approximately by the hop frequency ratio if the initial
   volume ratio is equal. Moreover, the result also demonstrates that the
   conventional interdiffusion model fails to describe the Kirkendall void
   growth dynamics. For numerical implementation, we reformulate the
   diffusion equation to the smoothed boundary form and solve it within the
   deforming body governed by steady-state Navier-Stokes equation. This
   work demonstrates that the presented method can be a useful tool for
   studying Kirkendall-effect-induced deformation.}},

Abstract = {{The current work investigates the propagation of premixed laminar
   reaction fronts for mixtures of isooctane-air and recirculated
   combustion products (or EGR) under high pressure and temperature
   conditions. The work uses a transient one-dimensional flame simulation
   with a skeletal 215 species chemical kinetic mechanism to generate
   laminar burning velocity and front thickness predictions. The simulation
   was exercised over fuel-air equivalence ratios, unburned gas
   temperatures, pressures and EGR levels ranging from 0.1 to 1.0, 400 to
   1000 K. 1 to 250 bar, and 0\% to 60\% (by mass) respectively, a range
   extending beyond that of previous researchers. Steady reaction fronts
   with burning velocities in excess of 5 cm/s could not be established
   under all of these conditions, especially when burned gas temperatures
   were below 1450 K and/or when characteristic reaction front propagation
   times were on the order of the unburned gas ignition delay. For a given
   pressure, T-u and T-b, the burning velocity of an EGR dilute mixture was
   found to be lower than that of an air dilute mixture, with the decrease
   in burning velocity attributed primarily to the reduced oxygen
   concentration's effect on chemistry. Steady premixed laminar burning
   velocities were correlated using a modified two-equation form based on
   the asymptotic structure of a laminar flame, which produced an average
   error of 3.4\% between the simulated and correlated laminar burning
   velocities, with a standard deviation of 4.3\%, while additional
   correlations were constructed for reaction front thickness and adiabatic
   flame temperature. Correlations are presented based on a non-product
   equivalence ratio phi and a fraction of stoichiometric combustion
   products X-SCP. Conversion factors are provided to facilitate
   application to modern direct injection internal combustion engines with
   inherent charge stratification where the local global phi is different
   from the global phi of the residual gas. (c) 2012 The Combustion

Abstract = {{Many combustion models that are based on the flamelet paradigm employ a
   reaction progress variable. While such a progress variable is well
   defined for one-step reaction kinetics, this is typically not the case
   for complex chemical mechanisms. Consequently, several expressions for a
   progress variable have been utilized. In this paper a formal method for
   the generation of a reaction progress variable is proposed that is
   optimal with respect to a set of constraints. The potential of the
   method is demonstrated in applications to partially premixed and
   diffusion flames, and the extension to premixed combustion is discussed.
   It is shown that the proposed method can lead to significant
   improvements in the definition of an optimal progress variable over
   conventional formulations, essentially eliminating the expert knowledge
   previously required in identifying such quantities. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Novel Insight into the Dynamics of Male Pelvic Floor Contractions
   Through Transperineal Ultrasound Imaging}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{188}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1224-1230}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Transperineal ultrasound imaging enables the minimally invasive
   assessment of pelvic floor muscle function. Although commonly used in
   women, the approach has rarely been reported in men. This approach has
   advantages because the midsagittal view visualizes a bony landmark and
   the entire urethral length. This allows investigation of the
   displacement of multiple points along the urethra and the unique
   mechanical actions of multiple muscles that could influence continence.
   We used a new transperineal ultrasound technique to compare the relative
   displacement of urethrovesical junction, anorectal junction and distal
   urethra during voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions in continent
   men.
   Materials and Methods: We performed measurement and comparison of
   urethral displacement at specific urethral regions in 10 continent men
   (age range 28 to 41 years). Measures made on 2-dimensional midsagittal
   plane ultrasound images included the displacements of specific points
   along the urethra. Anatomical considerations suggest that these are
   caused by contraction of the levator ani, striated urethral sphincter
   and bulbocavernosus muscles. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used
   to investigate the relationship between displacements of pairs of
   points.
   Results: Data show individual variation in displacement of the distal
   urethra (striated urethral sphincter contraction) and urethrovesical
   junction (levator ani contraction). A strong inverse linear relationship
   (0.723) between displacements of these points indicates 2 alternative
   strategies of urethral movement.
   Conclusions: Transperineal ultrasound imaging allows the simultaneous
   investigation of multiple pelvic floor muscles by measuring urethral
   displacement. The data provide evidence of different but coordinated
   strategies of urethral displacement in men.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Current therapies for male lower urinary tract symptoms
   secondary to prostate enlargement prevent hormonal effects on prostate
   growth and inhibit smooth muscle contraction to ease bladder neck and
   urethral pressure. However, lower urinary tract symptoms can be
   refractory to these therapies, suggesting that additional biological
   processes not addressed by them may also contribute to lower urinary
   tract symptoms. Aging associated fibrotic changes in tissue architecture
   contribute to dysfunction in multiple organ systems. Thus, we tested
   whether such changes potentially have a role in impaired urethral
   function and perhaps in male lower urinary tract symptoms.
   Materials and Methods: Periurethral tissues were obtained from a whole
   prostate ex vivo and from 28 consecutive men treated with radical
   prostatectomy. Lower urinary tract symptoms were assessed using the
   American Urological Association symptom index. Prostate tissues were
   subjected to mechanical testing to assess rigidity and stiffness. Fixed
   sections of these tissues were evaluated for collagen and elastin
   content, and glandularity to assess fibrosis. Statistical analysis
   included the Student t test and calculation of Pearson correlation
   coefficients to compare groups.
   Results: Periurethral prostate tissues demonstrated nonlinear
   viscoelastic mechanical behavior. Tissue from men with lower urinary
   tract symptoms was significantly stiffer (p = 0.0016) with significantly
   higher collagen content (p = 0.0038) and lower glandularity than that
   from men without lower urinary tract symptoms (American Urological
   Association symptom index 8 or greater vs 7 or less).
   Conclusions: Findings show that extracellular matrix deposition and
   fibrosis characterize the periurethral prostate tissue of some men with
   lower urinary tract symptoms. They point to fibrosis as a factor
   contributing to lower urinary tract symptom etiology.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have identified age differences in brain structure and
   function that correlate with declines in motor performance. While these
   investigations have typically focused on activity in isolated regions of
   the brain, resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging allow for more integrative
   assessments of spatially disparate neural networks. The novel
   contribution of the current study is to combine both resting state
   functional connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging to examine motor
   corticocortical circuits in young and older adults. We find that
   relatively greater functional connectivity between the primary motor
   cortices was strongly associated with decreased structural connectivity
   and poorer motor performance solely in older adults. We suggest that
   greater functional connectivity in older adults may be reflective of a
   release from the normally predominantly inhibitory interhemispheric
   communication associated with the primary motor cortices. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel three-dimensional fluffy PPy conductive fibrous
   scaffold (3D-cFSs) was fabricated by electrospinning technique combined
   with situ surface polymerization. Chemical compositions, morphology were
   characterized by fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and scanning electron

   coated PLLA fibers in the 3D-cFSs was 2.086 mu m, the thickness of PPy
   nano-layer was similar to 45 nm. These PPy coated PLLA fibers were in
   discrete state, the size of interconnected pores in the 3D-cFSs was from
   50 mu m to 100 mu m, this unique structure ensured that cells can entry
   into internal of 3D-cFSs smoothly without any other extra help to
   achieve three-dimensional cell culture (3D-culture). Rat
   pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells (as model cell) were cultured in the
   3D-cFSs to evaluate its potential application for nerve tissue
   engineering. The interaction between cell and scaffold was test by
   detecting the cell proliferation, viability, and morphology. After 3
   days culture, the number of PC12 in 3D-cFSs were much higher than that
   on the conductive fibrous meshes (cFMs) and well developed cell-fibers
   constructs were observed from fluorescence image and SEM of PC12 in the
   central of 3D-cFSs. These results showed that the 3D-cFSs provided cell
   3D-culture, and improved cell growth. Therefore, we suggest that the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the singular values and singular vectors of
   finite, low rank perturbations of large rectangular random matrices.
   Specifically, we prove almost sure convergence of the extreme singular
   values and appropriate projections of the corresponding singular vectors
   of the perturbed matrix.
   As in the prequel, where we considered the eigenvalues of Hermitian
   matrices, the non-random limiting value is shown to depend explicitly on
   the limiting singular value distribution of the unperturbed matrix via
   an integral transform that linearizes rectangular additive convolution
   in free probability theory. The asymptotic position of the extreme
   singular values of the perturbed matrix differs from that of the
   original matrix if and only if the singular values of the perturbing
   matrix are above a certain critical threshold which depends on this same
   aforementioned integral transform.
   We examine the consequence of this singular value phase transition on
   the associated left and right singular eigenvectors and discuss the
   fluctuations of the singular values around these non-random limits. (C)

Abstract = {{Electrospun polymer nanofibers show promise as components of scaffolds
   for tissue engineering because of their ability to orient regenerating
   cells. Our research focuses on aligned electrospun fiber scaffolds for
   nerve regeneration. Critical to this are highly aligned fibers, which
   are frequently difficult to manufacture reproducibly. Here we show that
   three variables: the distance between the spinneret tip and collector,
   the addition of DMF to the solvent, and placement of an aluminum sheet
   on the spinneret together greatly improve the alignment of electrospun
   poly-L-lactide (PLLA) nanofibers. We identified the most important
   variable as tip-to-collector distance. Nanofiber alignment was maximal
   at 30 cm compared to shorter distances. DMF:chloroform (1:9) improved
   nanofiber uniformity and was integral to maintaining a uniform stream
   over the 30 cm tip-to-collector distance. Other ratios caused
   splattering of the solution or flattening or beading of the fibers and
   non-uniform fiber diameter. The aluminum sheet helped to stabilize the
   electric field and improve fiber alignment provided that it was placed
   at 1 cm behind the tip, while other distances destabilized the stream
   and worsened alignment. This study demonstrates that control of these
   variables produces dramatic improvement in reproducibly obtaining high
   alignment and uniform morphology of electrospun PLLA nanofibers.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel framework for evaluating the shape
   sensitivities of the von Mises stress function using an isoparametric
   finite-element formulation. The use of the isoparametric formulation
   allows us to apply the level set method to structures that are confined
   to irregularly shaped domains and therefore must be modeled using
   body-fitted, nonuniform finite element meshes. The shape sensitivities
   of the von Mises stress function are evaluated on this nonuniform mesh
   and mapped isoparametrically to a uniform Cartesian grid on which the
   Hamilton-Jacobi equation is solved. The paper also introduces a new
   approach to the enforcement of volume constraints based on the augmented
   Lagrangian formulation. The method is demonstrated on a series of
   two-dimensional problems including an isoparametric variation of the
   classic L-bracket problem. We show that the isoparametric level set
   method produces converged, feasible designs whose performance is
   comparable to SIMP results in terms of their final objective value. (c)

   The results showed that 8YSZ matrix composites had good mechanical

Abstract = {{Porous adsorbents such as MOF-5 have low thermal conductivities which
   can limit the performance of adsorption-based hydrogen storage systems.
   To improve the thermal properties of these materials, we have prepared a
   series of high-density MOP-5 composites containing 0-10 wt \% expanded
   natural graphite (ENG), which serves as a thermal conduction enhancer.
   The addition of 10 wt \% ENG to MOF-5 and compaction to 0.5 g/cm(3) was
   previously found to increase the thermal conductivity relative to neat
   MOP-5 of the same density by a factor of 5. In this study, detailed
   measurements of the hydrogen storage behavior of MOF-5/ENG composites
   between 77 and 295 K are reported. We find that MOF-5 pellets with 0 wt
   \% ENG and a density of 0.5 g/cm(3) have a total volumetric hydrogen
   storage density at 77 K and 100 bar that is 23\% larger than powder
   MOF-5 and 41\% larger than cryo-compressed hydrogen. The addition of
   10\% ENG to 0.5 g/cm(3) MOF-5 pellets produces only a small decrease
   (6\%) in the total volumetric hydrogen storage compared to neat MOF-5
   pellets of equal density. The excess, absolute, total, and deliverable
   hydrogen storage amounts by the MOF-5 composites are compared for ENG
   additions of 0-10 wt \% and pellet densities of 0.3-0.7 g/cm(3). Three
   adsorption models (Unilan, Toth, Dubinin-Astakhov) are compared for
   their effectiveness in describing hydrogen adsorption isotherms of MOF-5
   and MOF-5/ENG composites. The Unilan model provides the most accurate
   description of the experimental data, requiring only five
   temperature-invariant parameters to accurately fit the data across a
   wide temperature range.}},

Abstract = {{In a pixelated detector, an electron cloud can be collected by and
   shared between several adjacent pixels. By including these
   charge-sharing events, the Compton-imaging efficiency can be improved
   for 3D position sensitive room-temperature CdZnTe gamma-ray detectors.
   Simulated photopeak events that trigger three separate pixels with two
   pixels being adjacent to each other, which are called three-pixel
   side-neighbor photopeak events, were divided into six categories based
   on interaction type. Analysis of this simulation shows that the most
   effective strategy is to treat all side-neighbor events as
   charge-sharing events and to combine all side-neighbor signals into a
   single interaction. By including these side-neighbor events in the
   Compton image reconstruction, we can improve the imaging efficiency by
   45\% and 160\% for 662 key and 1333 key incident photons, respectively.
   The simulation also shows that 76\% of these combined events reconstruct
   to rings that pass the source direction. Measured data is presented to
   validate the simulation results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{37}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{Kinesins are molecular motors which transport various cargoes in the
   cytoplasm of cells and are involved in cell division. Previous models
   for kinesins have only targeted their in vitro motion. Thus, their
   applicability is limited to kinesin moving in a fluid with low
   viscosity. However, highly viscoelastic fluids have considerable effects
   on the movement of kinesin. For example, the high viscosity modifies the
   relation between the load and the speed of kinesin. While the velocity
   of kinesin has a nonlinear dependence with respect to the load in
   environments with low viscosity, highly viscous forces change that
   behavior. Also, the elastic nature of the fluid changes the velocity of
   kinesin. The new mechanistic model described in this paper considers the
   viscoelasticity of the fluid using subdiffusion. The approach is based
   on a generalized Langevin equation and fractional Brownian motion.
   Results show that a single kinesin has a maximum velocity when the ratio
   between the viscosity and elasticity is about 0.5. Additionally, the new
   model is able to capture the transient dynamics, which allows the
   prediction of the motion of kinesin under time varying loads.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in optical and structural properties of indium rich (27\%),
   indium gallium nitride (InGaN) self-organized quantum dots (QDs), with
   red wavelength emission, and the two dimensional underlying wetting
   layer (WL) are investigated. Temperature dependent
   micro-photoluminescence (mu PL) reveals a decrease in thermal quenching
   of the QDs integrated intensity compared to that of the WL. This
   difference in behaviour is due to the 3-D localization of carriers
   within the QDs preventing them from thermalization to nearby traps
   causing an increase in the internal quantum efficiency of the device.
   Excitation power dependent mu PL shows a slower increase of the QDs PL
   signal compared to the WL PL which is believed to be due to the QDs
   saturation. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Effect of nanoparticle polydispersity on the self-assembly of polymer
   tethered nanospheres}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Recent simulations predict that aggregating nanospheres functionalized
   with polymer ``tethers{''} can self-assemble to form a cylinder,
   perforated lamellae, lamellae, and even the double gyroid phase, which
   are phases also seen in block copolymer and surfactant systems.
   Nanoparticle size polydispersity is likely to be a characteristic of
   these systems. If too high, polydispersity may destabilize a phase.
   Using multiple thermodynamic paths to explore the phase diagram as a
   function of temperature and polydispersity, we explore the effect of
   nanosphere size polydispersity on the phase diagram. We show that in the
   portions of the phase diagram characterized by an icosahedral local
   nanoparticle packing motif, a low amount of polydispersity lowers the
   energy and a large amount of polydispersity raises the energy of the
   system by disrupting the icosahedral packing. In general, regions of the
   phase diagram characterized by liquid-like icosahedral packing have high
   terminal polydispersities from 15\% to more than 30\%. In the regions of
   the phase diagram characterized by crystalline local packing,
   polydispersity raises the energy of the system and induces a phase
   transition from crystalline to liquid-like ordering within the
   nanosphere rich regions of the microphase. We find the bilayer
   crystalline lamellae phase has a terminal polydispersity of 6\%, but may
   still be partially crystalline up to 12\%. (C) 2012 American Institute

Abstract = {{Chirality at the nanometer scale represents one of the most rapidly
   developing areas of research. Self-assembly of DNA-nanoparticle (NP)
   hybrids enables geometrically precise assembly of chiral isomers. The
   concept of a discrete chiral nanostructure of tetrahedral shape and
   topology fabricated from four different NPs located in the corners of
   the pyramid is fundamental to the field. While the first observations of
   optical activity of mixed pyramidal assemblies were made in 2009 (Chen,
   W.; et al. Nano Lett. 2009, 9, 2153-2159), further studies are difficult
   without finely resolved optical data for precisely organized NP
   pyramidal enantiomers. Here we describe the preparation of a family of
   self-assembled chiral pyramids made from multiple metal and/or
   semiconductor NPs with a yield as high as 80\%. Purposefully made R- and
   S-enantiomers of chiral pyramids with four different NPs from three
   different materials displayed strong chiroptical activity, with
   anisotropy g-factors as high as 1.9 x 10(-2) in the visible spectral
   range. Importantly, all NP constituents contribute to the chiroptical
   activity of the R/S pyramids. We were able to observe three different
   circular dichroism signals in the range of 350-550 nm simultaneously.
   They correspond to the plasmonic oscillations of gold, silver, and
   bandgap transitions of quantum dots. Tunability of chiroptical bands
   related to these transitions is essential from fundamental and practical
   points of view. The predictability of optical properties of pyramids,
   the simplicity of their self-assembly in comparison with lithography,
   and the possibility for polymerase chain reaction-based automation of
   their synthesis are expected to facilitate their future applications.}},

Abstract = {{We performed all-atom and coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations of lipid bilayers grafted with elastin-like polypeptides
   (ELPs; {[}VPGVG](n)). All-atom simulations of a single ELP in water show
   that ELPs become more collapsed and folded as the temperature increases
   from 293 up to 353 K, in agreement with experiments. All-atom
   simulations of lipid bilayers composed of
   dipalmitoylglycerophosphocholine (DPPC), cholesterol, and fatty acids
   grafted with ELPs show that ELPs insert into the bilayer and
   significantly disorder lipids, to an extent that depends on the ELP
   length over the temperature range 293-323 K. In the bilayer, ELPs are
   mainly, but not entirely, random coil in character at temperatures
   between 293 and 315 K and, in contrast to the behavior in water, become
   increasing random coil and extended in length over the range 315-323 K,
   over which the bilayer is in the disordered liquid phase. The insertion
   of ELPs into the lipid-tail region is mediated by the interaction of
   hydrophobic Pro and Val residues with lipid tails, which become stronger
   at increased temperature, but the insertion is incomplete because of the
   interaction between hydrophilic backbones of Gly residues and the lipid
   headgroups. Longer time CG simulations of the transition from ordered
   gel to disordered liquid bilayer at 315 K in a liposome are able to
   capture cholesterol flip-flops between bilayer leaflets, leading to an
   increase in the number of cholesterols in the inner layer, which helps
   the bilayer accommodate the reduced membrane curvature resulting from
   the expansion of the bilayer area driven by the phase transition. Our
   findings indicate that lipid bilayers can be disrupted more effectively
   by the stronger hydrophobic interaction of the random coils of ELPs at
   315-323 K than by the compact ELPs at 293-310 K, which helps explain the
   experimental observation that ELP-conjugated liposomes are stable at 310
   K, but become unstable and release drugs at 315 K.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to provide a method for choosing joining (e.g.,
   bolt) locations for attaching structural reinforcements onto complex
   structures. The joining locations affect structural performance criteria
   such as the frequency response and the static compliance of the modified
   structure. One approach to finding improved/optimal joining locations is
   to place the joints such that the total amount of energy input into the
   structure (from external forces) is lowered/minimized, thus ensuring
   that the performance of the structure is least affected by the
   structural modifications. However, such an approach does not account for
   the stresses in the joints. Therefore, in this work, the amount of
   strain energy concentrated in the joints is also considered. The cost
   function for this optimization problem is then composed of two energies.
   These energies are different for the undamped and damped cases. Herein,
   the focus is on the (more realistic) damped case. The cost function is
   minimized by a modified optimality criteria method. This process is time
   consuming because it requires the calculation of sensitivities of the
   joint strain energy, which in turn requires the calculation of the
   displacements of all candidate joint locations by using the system-level
   mass and stiffness matrices and force vector (at each frequency in the
   range of interest). To address this issue, a series of complex algebraic
   manipulations and approximations are used to significantly reduce the
   computational cost. In addition, for the case where structural and
   geometrical variations are necessary, parametric reduced-order models
   are used to compute the cost function with further significant gains in
   computational speed. Numerical results for improved/optimal joining are
   presented for representative complex structures with structural
   variabilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Voxelwise quantification of hepatic perfusion parameters from dynamic
   contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging greatly contributes to assessment of
   liver function in response to radiation therapy. However, the efficiency
   of the estimation of hepatic perfusion parameters voxel-by-voxel in the
   whole liver using a dual-input single-compartment model requires
   substantial improvement for routine clinical applications. In this
   paper, we utilize the parallel computation power of a graphics
   processing unit (GPU) to accelerate the computation, while maintaining
   the same accuracy as the conventional method. Using compute unified
   device architecture-GPU, the hepatic perfusion computations over
   multiple voxels are run across the GPU blocks concurrently but
   independently. At each voxel, nonlinear least-squares fitting the time
   series of the liver DCE data to the compartmental model is distributed
   to multiple threads in a block, and the computations of different time
   points are performed simultaneously and synchronically. An efficient
   fast Fourier transform in a block is also developed for the convolution
   computation in the model. The GPU computations of the voxel-by-voxel
   hepatic perfusion images are compared with ones by the CPU using the
   simulated DCE data and the experimental DCE MR images from patients. The
   computation speed is improved by 30 times using a NVIDIA Tesla C2050 GPU
   compared to a 2.67 GHz Intel Xeon CPU processor. To obtain liver
   perfusion maps with 626 400 voxels in a patient's liver, it takes 0.9
   min with the GPU-accelerated voxelwise computation, compared to 110 min
   with the CPU, while both methods result in perfusion parameters
   differences less than 10(-6). The method will be useful for generating
   liver perfusion images in clinical settings.}},

   Nanoparticle-Nanorod Assemblies}},
Journal = {{ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{7330-7335}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence sensing of enantiomers is a much needed yet very
   challenging task due to nearly identical chemical and physical
   properties of the chiral isomers also known as chiral equivalence. In
   this study, we propose a novel strategy for fluorescence sensing of
   enantiomers using chiral nanoparticles and their ability to form dynamic
   assemblies. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in nanoscale
   assemblies consisting of either L-cysteine- or D-cysteine-modified
   quantum dots (QDs) and gold nanorods (GNRs) was found to be strongly
   dependent on traces of cysteine. This occurs due to high sensitivity of
   dynamic assemblies to the weak internanoparticle interactions that can
   exponentially increase energy transfer efficiencies from QDs to GNRs.
   Comprehensive analysis of the fluorescence responses in the two types of
   chiral nanoscale assemblies enables accurate determination of both
   concentration and enantiomeric composition of the analyte, i.e.,
   cysteine. The described method can quantify the composition of a chiral
   sample, even the content of one enantiomer is as low as 10\% in the
   mixture. Exceptional selectivity in respect to D/L-cysteine in
   comparison to analogous small molecules was observed. Versatility of
   nanoparticle-nanorod assemblies and tunability of intermolecular
   interactions in them open the road to adaptation of this sensing
   platform to other chiral analytes.}},

Abstract = {{A preclinical prototype of a transcutaneous thermal therapy system has
   been developed for the targeted treatment of breast cancer cells using
   focused microwaves as an adjuvant to radiation, chemotherapy, and
   high-intensity-focused ultrasound. The prototype system employs a 2-D
   array of tapered microstrip patch antennas operating at 915 MHz to focus
   continuous-wave microwave energy transcutaneously into the pendent
   breast suspended in a coupling medium. Prior imaging studies are used to
   ascertain the material properties of the breast tissue, and these data
   are incorporated into a multiphysics model. Time-reversal techniques are
   employed to find a solution (relative amplitudes and phase) for focusing
   at a given location. Modeling tests of this time-reversal focusing
   method have been performed, which demonstrate good targeting accuracy
   within heterogeneous breast tissue. Experimental results using the
   laboratory prototype to perform focused heating in tissue-mimicking
   gelatin phantoms have demonstrated 1.5-cm-diameter focal spot sizes and
   differential heating at the desired focus sufficient to achieve an
   antitumor effect confined to the target region.}},

Abstract = {{Beam-on time is an important measure of the delivery efficiency in
   intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Traditionally, minimizing
   beam-on time has been postponed until the leaf sequencing stage, where
   the treatment plan quality is already determined and fixed. However,
   there is a trade-off between the beam-on time and the treatment plan
   quality. The aim of this study is to incorporate the beam-on time into
   the treatment plan optimization stage using a direct aperture
   optimization approach that allows for explicitly quantifying the
   trade-off. The proposed approach can provide clinicians with valuable
   information for each patient case so that they can design clinically
   attractive yet efficient treatment plans. Using the special structure of
   the problem, we propose an exact solution approach that sequentially
   characterizes segments of the Pareto-efficient frontier. In addition, an
   approximate solution technique that is applicable to more classes of
   evaluation criteria is developed. Our approximate technique is tested on
   clinical cancer cases, and its performance is compared with the general
   approximation techniques that are available for convex bicriteria
   optimization problems. The results of our experiments validate that our
   approach can achieve a more accurate representation of the
   Pareto-efficient frontier with less computational effort.}},

Abstract = {{Crisis-level overcrowding conditions in emergency departments (EDs) have
   led hospitals to seek out new patient-flow designs to improve both
   responsiveness and safety. One approach that has attracted attention and
   experimentation in the emergency medicine community is a system in which
   ED beds and care teams are segregated and patients are ``streamed{''}
   based on predictions of whether they will be discharged or admitted to
   the hospital. In this paper, we use a combination of analytic and
   simulation models to determine whether such a streaming policy can
   improve ED performance, where it is most likely to be effective, and how
   it should be implemented for maximum performance. Our results suggest
   that the concept of streaming can indeed improve patient flow, but only
   in some situations. First, ED resources must be shared across streams
   rather than physically separated. This leads us to propose a new
   ``virtual-streaming{''} patient flow design for EDs. Second, this type
   of streaming is most effective in EDs with (1) a high percentage of
   admitted patients, (2) longer care times for admitted patients than
   discharged patients, (3) a high day-to-day variation in the percentage
   of admitted patients, (4) long patient boarding times (e.g., caused by
   hospital ``bed-block{''}), and (5) high average physician utilization.
   Finally, to take full advantage of streaming, physicians assigned to
   admit patients should prioritize upstream (new) patients, whereas
   physicians assigned to discharge patients should prioritize downstream
   (old) patients.}},

Abstract = {{High average power, all-fiber integrated, broadband supercontinuum (SC)
   sources are demonstrated. Architecture for SC generation using amplified
   picosecond/nanosecond laser diode (LD) pulses followed by modulation
   instability (MI) induced pulse breakup is presented and used to
   demonstrate SC sources from the mid-IR to the visible wavelengths. In
   addition to the simplicity in implementation, this architecture allows
   scaling up of the SC average power by increasing the pulse repetition
   rate and the corresponding pump power, while keeping the peak power,
   and, hence, the spectral extent approximately constant. Using this
   process, we demonstrate > 10 W in a mid-IR SC extending from similar to
   0.8 to 4 mu m, > 5 W in a near IR SC extending from similar to 0.8 to
   2.8 mu m, and >0.7 W in a visible SC extending from similar to 0.45 to
   1.2 mu m. SC modulation capability is also demonstrated in a mid-IR SC
   laser with similar to 3.9 W in an SC extending from similar to 0.8 to
   4.3 mu m. The entire system and SC output in this case is modulated by a
   500 Hz square wave at 50\% duty cycle without any external chopping or
   modulation. We also explore the use of thulium doped fiber amplifier
   (TDFA) stages for mid-IR SC generation. In addition to the higher pump
   to signal conversion efficiency demonstrated in TDFAs compared to
   erbium/ytterbium doped fiber amplifier (EYFA), the shifting of the SC
   pump from similar to 1.5 to similar to 2 mu m is pursued with an attempt
   to generate a longer extending SC into the mid-IR. We demonstrate
   similar to 2.5 times higher optical conversion efficiency from pump to
   SC generation in wavelengths beyond 3.8 mu m in the TDFA versus the EYFA
   based SC systems. The TDFA SC spectrum extends from similar to 1.9 to
   4.5 mu m with similar to 2.6 W at 50\% modulation with a 250 Hz square
   wave. A variety of applications in defense, health care and metrology
   are also demonstrated using the SC laser systems presented in this

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the use of magnetically coupled resonators for
   midrange wireless non-radiative power transfer (WNPT). A quasi-static
   (circuit) model is developed to establish key measures of performance
   and to aid in design. The use of directly fed, resonant shielded loops
   for WNPT is also proposed for the first time. Two experimental WNPT
   systems employing shielded loops are reported. A comprehensive
   experimental study is performed, and the performance of the WNPT systems
   shows close agreement with analytical predictions and developed circuit
   models. With a single-turn system of loop radius 10.7 cm, power transfer
   efficiency of 41.8\% is achieved at a loop separation of 35 cm (3.3 loop
   radii). When the number of turns is increased to ten, a power transfer
   efficiency of 36.5\% is achieved at a loop separation of 56 cm (5.3 loop
   radii). Measured magnetic field levels in the vicinity of the WNPT
   systems are shown to closely agree with analytical field values.}},

Abstract = {{A novel energetic cocrystal predicted to exhibit greater power and
   similar sensitivity to that of the current military standard explosive
   1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazacyclooctane (HMX) is presented. The
   cocrystal consists of a 2:1 molar ratio of
   2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), a
   powerful explosive too sensitive for military use, and HMX. A predicted
   detonation velocity 100 m/s higher than that of beta-HMX, the most
   powerful pure form of HMX, was calculated for the cocrystal using
   Cheetah 6.0. In small-scale impact drop tests the cocrystal exhibits
   sensitivity indistinguishable from that of beta-HMX. This surprisingly
   low sensitivity is hypothesized to be due to an increased degree of
   hydrogen bonding observed in the cocrystal structure relative to the
   crystals of pure HMX and CL-20. Such bonding is prevalent in this and
   other energetic cocrystals and may be an important consideration in the
   design of future materials. By being more powerful and safe to handle,
   the cocrystal presented is an attractive candidate to supplant the
   current military state-of-the-art explosive, HMX.}},

Abstract = {{Compressed sensing (CS) has been used for accelerating magnetic
   resonance imaging acquisitions, but its use in applications with rapid
   spatial phase variations is challenging, e. g., proton resonance
   frequency shift (PRF-shift) thermometry and velocity mapping.
   Previously, an iterative MRI reconstruction with separate magnitude and
   phase regularization was proposed for applications where magnitude and
   phase maps are both of interest, but it requires fully sampled data and
   unwrapped phase maps. In this paper, CS is combined into this framework
   to reconstruct magnitude and phase images accurately from undersampled
   data. Moreover, new phase regularization terms are proposed to
   accommodate phase wrapping and to reconstruct images with encoded phase
   variations, e. g., PRF-shift thermometry and velocity mapping. The
   proposed method is demonstrated with simulated thermometry data and in
   vivo velocity mapping data and compared to conventional phase corrected
   CS.}},

Abstract = {{Our previous studies have demonstrated that a generation 5 dendrimer
   (GS) conjugated with both folic acid (FA) and methotrexate (MTX) has a
   higher chemotherapeutic index than MTX alone. Despite this,
   batch-to-batch inconsistencies in the number of FA and MTX molecules
   linked to each dendrimer led to conjugate batches with varying
   biological activity, especially when scaleup synthesis was attempted.
   Since the MTX is conjugated through an ester linkage, there were
   concerns that biological inconsistency could also result from serum
   esterase activity and differential bioavailability of the targeted
   conjugate. In order to resolve these problems, we undertook a novel
   approach to synthesize a polyvalent G5-MTXn conjugate through click
   chemistry, attaching the MTX to the dendrimer through an esterase-stable
   amide linkage. Surface plasmon resonance binding studies show that a
   G5-MTX10 conjugate synthesized in this manner binds to the FA receptor
   (FR) through polyvalent interaction showing 4300-fold higher affinity
   than free MTX. The conjugate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, and
   induces cytotoxicity in FR expressing KB cells through FR specific
   cellular internalization. Thus, the polyvalent MTX On the dendrimer
   serves the dual role as a targeting molecule as well as a
   chemotherapeutic drug. The newly synthesized G5-MTXn conjugate may serve
   as a FR-targeted chemotherapeutic with potential for cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{NextGen aviation will require an even greater reliance on automation
   than current-day operations. Therefore, systems with problems in
   human-automation interaction must be identified and resolved early, well
   before they are introduced into operation. This paper describes a
   research and software development effort to build a prototype automation
   design advisor tool (ADAT) for flight deck automation. This tool uses
   models of human performance to identify perceptual, cognitive, and
   action-related inefficiencies in the design of flight management
   systems. Aviation designers can use the tool to evaluate and compare
   potential flight deck automation designs and to identify potential
   human-automation interaction concerns. Designers can compare different
   flightmanagement systems in terms of specific features and their ability
   to support pilot performance. ADAT provides specific, research-based
   guidance for resolving problematic design issues. It was specifically
   designed to be flexible enough for both current-day technologies and
   revolutionary NextGen designs. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to compare the effects of various forms
   of advanced cockpit automation for flight planning on pilot performance
   and workload under a futuristic concept of operation. A lab experiment
   was conducted in which airline pilots flew simulated tailored arrivals
   to an airport using three modes of automation (MOAs), including a
   control-display unit (CDU) to the aircraft flight management system, an
   enhanced CDU(CDU+), and a continuous descent approach (CDA) tool. The
   arrival scenario required replanning to avoid convective activity and
   was constrained by a minimum fuel requirement at the initial approach
   fix. The CDU and CDU+ modes allowed for point-by-point path planning or
   selection among multiple standard arrivals, respectively. The CDA mode
   completely automated the route replanning for pilots. It was expected
   that the higher-level automation would significantly reduce pilot
   workload and improve overall flight performance. In general, results
   indicated that the MOAs influenced pilot performance and workload
   responses according to hypotheses. This study provides new knowledge
   about the relationship of cockpit automation and interface features with
   pilot performance and workload in a novel next generation-style flight
   concept of operation. (C) 2012Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   ZrN/Si films upon intense ion irradiations was investigated with the
   focus on new phase formation. Zirconium silicide (ZrSi) forms at the
   ZrN/Si interface under intense irradiations of 300 key Ne+ and 1 MeV
   Kr2+ in the elastic stopping regime. The strong ballistic effects may
   cause atom mixing at the ZrN/Si interface, leading to the precipitation
   of ZrSi. Interface mixing and the formation of ZrSi also occur with
   swift heavy ion irradiation (1.465 GeV Xe). Thermal spikes in the
   nano-scale latent tracks and transient high temperature may lead to the
   atom mixing across the ZrN/Si interface and subsequent ZrSi formation

Abstract = {{Perovskite, ABO(3), structures are an important class of ceramics with a
   large variety of derivative structure-types (cubic, tetragonal,
   hexagonal, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral). Radiation damage in
   perovskites is of interest due to their potential as actinide waste
   forms and to understand radiation effects in uranium- and
   thorium-bearing phases. Powder CaZrO3 perovskite was irradiated with
   940-MeV Au ions up to 1.5 x 10(13) ions/cm(2). Changes in the crystal
   structure were followed in situ as function of fluence by means of a
   sequence of X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Ion-induced
   amorphization is evidenced by a decrease in diffraction intensity and an
   increase in diffuse scattering. Based on XRD measurements, as well as
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), CaZrO3 is completely amorphized
   at a fluence of 1.5 x 1013 ions/cm(2). From the evolution of the
   integrated XRD-maxima intensities with fluence, the diameter of the
   amorphous tracks is estimated to be 6.0 +/- 0.6 nm, which is
   independently confirmed by bright-field TEM images: 6.7 +/- 0.4 nm.
   Changes in the positions of diffraction maxima may be caused by at least
   two processes. Broadening of the diffraction maxima is analyzed using a
   Williamson-Hall plot. Strain-induced broadening is the dominant process.

Abstract = {{China has pledged to reduce its CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45\%
   by 2020 as of 2005 level. This research examines China's 2020 carbon
   intensity target and its interdependence with the overarching national
   economic and social development goals. The results show that, with
   annual GDP growth rate at 7\% during the 12th Five-Year-Plan (FYP)
   period and 6\% during the 13th FYP period, the 45\% CO2 intensity
   reduction target implies annual CO2 emissions of 8600 million tonnes by
   2020, close to 8400 million tonnes, the UNFCCC 450 ppm scenario for
   China. However, achieving only the 40\% reduction target will lead to
   9380 million tonnes CO2 emissions in 2020 which largely surpass the
   UNFCCC 450 ppm scenario. We conclude that China's 45\% CO2 intensity
   reduction target is not only within international expectations but also
   self-consistent with its overall economic and social development
   strategy. Then primary energy and power planning for implementing the
   45\% carbon intensity reduction target is proposed. Related investment
   requirements are also estimated. To achieve the target. China needs to
   restructure the economic structure for significant improvements in
   energy conservation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Unraveling the complex interplay between thermal properties and
   hydration is a part of understanding the fundamental properties of many
   soft materials and very essential for many applications. Here we show
   that graphene oxide (GO) demonstrates a highly negative thermal
   expansion (NTE) coefficient owing to unique thermohydration processes
   related with fast transport of water between the GO sheets, the
   amphiphilic nature of nanochannels, and close-to-zero intrinsic thermal
   expansion of GO. The humidity-dependent NTE of GO layered assemblies, or
   ``pseudonegative thermal expansion{''} (PNTE), differs from that of
   other hygroscopic materials due to its relatively fast and highly
   reversible expansion/contraction cycles and occurrence at low humidity
   levels while bearing similarities to classic NTE. Thermal expansion of
   polyvinyl alcohol/GO composites is easily tunable with additional
   intricacy of thermohydration effects. PNTE combined with isotropy,
   nontoxicity, and mechanical robustness is an asset for applications of
   actuators, sensors, MEMS devices, and memory materials and crucial for
   developing methods of thermal/photopatterning of GO devices.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS}},

Abstract = {{We present A-MAC, a receiver-initiated link layer for low-power wireless
   networks that supports several services under a unified architecture,
   and does so more efficiently and scalably than prior approaches. A-MAC's
   versatility stems from layering unicast, broadcast, wakeup, pollcast,
   and discovery above a single, flexible synchronization primitive.
   A-MAC's efficiency stems from optimizing this primitive and with it the
   most consequential decision that a low-power link makes: whether to stay
   awake or go to sleep after probing the channel. Today's
   receiver-initiated protocols require more time and energy to make this
   decision, and they exhibit worse judgment as well, leading to many false
   positives and negatives, and lower packet delivery ratios. A-MAC begins
   to make this decision quickly, and decides more conclusively and
   correctly in both the negative and affirmative. A-MAC's scalability
   comes from reserving one channel for the initial handshake and different
   channels for data transfer. Our results show that: (i) a unified
   implementation is possible; (ii) A-MAC's idle listening power increases
   by just 1.12x under interference, compared to 17.3x for LPL and 54.7x
   for RI-MAC; (iii) A-MAC offers high single-hop delivery ratios; (iv)
   network wakeup is faster and more channel efficient than LPL; and (v)
   collection routing performance exceeds the state-of-the-art.}},

   Estimation}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We study the problem of optimal sensor placement in the context of soil
   moisture sensing. We show that the soil moisture data possesses some
   unique features that can be used together with the commonly used
   Gaussian assumption to construct more scalable, robust, and better
   performing placement algorithms. Specifically, there exists a
   coarse-grained monotonic ordering of locations in their soil moisture
   level over time, both in terms of its first and second moments, a
   feature much more stable than the soil moisture process itself at these
   locations. This motivates a clustered sensor placement scheme, where
   locations are classified into clusters based on the ordering of the
   mean, with the number of sensors placed in each cluster determined by
   the ordering of the variances. We show that under idealized conditions
   the greedy mutual information maximization algorithm applied globally is
   equivalent to that applied cluster by cluster, but the latter has the
   advantage of being more scalable. Extensive numerical experiments are
   performed on a set of three-dimensional soil moisture data generated by
   a state-of-the-art soil moisture simulator. Our results show that our
   clustering approach outperforms applying the same algorithms globally,
   and is very robust to lack of training and errors in training data.}},

Abstract = {{Reconstruction of complex craniofacial deformities is a clinical
   challenge in situations of injury, congenital defects or disease. The
   use of cell-based therapies represents one of the most advanced methods
   for enhancing the regenerative response for craniofacial wound healing.
   Both somatic and stem cells have been adopted in the treatment of
   complex osseous defects and advances have been made in finding the most
   adequate scaffold for the delivery of cell therapies in human
   regenerative medicine. As an example of such approaches for clinical
   application for craniofacial regeneration, Ixmyelocel-T or bone repair
   cells are a source of bone marrow derived stem and progenitor cells.
   They are produced through the use of single pass perfusion bioreactors
   for CD90+ mesenchymal stem cells and CD14+ monocyte/macrophage
   progenitor cells. The application of ixmyelocel-T has shown potential in
   the regeneration of muscular, vascular, nervous and osseous tissue. The
   purpose of this manuscript is to highlight cell therapies used to repair
   bony and soft tissue defects in the oral and craniofacial complex. The
   field at this point remains at an early stage, however this review will
   provide insights into the progress being made using cell therapies for
   eventual development into clinical practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We examined the behavior of phenylalanine in high-temperature water
   (HTW) at 220, 250, 280, and 350?degrees C. Under these conditions, the
   major product is phenylethylamine. The minor products include styrene
   and phenylethanol (1-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethanol), which appear at
   higher temperatures and longer batch holding times. Phenylethylamine
   forms via decarboxylation of phenylalanine, styrene forms via
   deamination of phenylethylamine, and phenylethanol forms via hydration
   of styrene. We quantified the molar yields of each product at the four
   temperatures, and the carbon recovery was between 80100?\% for most
   cases. Phenylalanine disappearance follows first-order kinetics with an
   activation energy of 144 +/- 14 kJ?mol-1 and a pre-exponential factor of
   1012.4 +/- 1.4 min-1. A kinetics model based on the proposed pathways
   was consistent with the experimental data. Effects of five different
   salts (NaCl, NaNO3, Na2SO4, KCl, K2HPO4) and boric acid (H3BO3) on
   phenylalanine behavior at 250?degrees C have also been elucidated. These
   additives increase phenylalanine conversion, but decrease the yield of
   phenylethylamine presumably by promoting formation of high molecular
   weight compounds. Lastly, binary mixtures of phenylalanine and ethyl
   oleate have been studied at 350?degrees C and three different molar
   concentration ratios. The presence of phenylalanine enhances the
   conversion of ethyl oleate and molar yields of fatty acid. Higher
   concentration of ethyl oleate leads to increased deamination of
   phenylethylamine and hydration of styrene. Amides are also formed due to
   the interaction of oleic acid/ethyl oleate and phenylethylamine/ammonia
   and lead to a decrease in the fatty acid yields. Taken collectively,
   these results provide new insights into the reactions of algae during
   its hydrothermal liquefaction to produce crude bio-oil.}},

Abstract = {{A scalar metric for the assessment of hull surface producibility was
   known to be useful in estimating the complexity of a hull form of ships
   or large offshore structures by looking at their shape. However, it
   could not serve as a comprehensive measuring tool due to its lack of
   important components of the hull form such as longitudinals, stiffeners,
   and web frames attached to the hull surface. To have a complete metric
   for cost estimation, these structural members must be included. In this
   paper, major inner structural members are considered by measuring the
   complexity of their geometric shape. The final scalar metric thus
   consists of the classes containing inner members with various curvature
   magnitudes as well as the classes containing curved plates with single
   and double curvature distribution. Those two distinct metrics are merged
   into a complete scalar metric that accounts for the total cost
   estimation of complex structural bodies.}},

   bias multiwave length illumination stress method. TFT I-D-V-G curves
   exhibit a negative threshold voltage shift together with an increase in
   I-D off current and increase in subthreshold slope with increasing
   photon energy and illumination time. Analysis of transistor
   characteristics indicates that one component governing negative
   threshold voltage shifts is a decrease in grain boundary-trapped charge
   areal density due to illumination. This relationship can be explained by
   conduction based on thermionic emission over potential barriers formed
   at the ZnO crystallite boundaries. I-D off-state current trends with
   photon energy in a manner consistent with exponentially decreasing

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide-based transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors (TAOS) are
   strong contenders to replace amorphous and polycrystalline silicon for
   large area display backplanes due to their high electron mobility. To
   enable future roll-to-roll printed electronics, solution-processed

   measurements from 77 to 300 K to quantitatively compare charge transport
   mechanisms and band-tail density of states of solution-processed zinc
   tin oxide (ZTO) thin film transistors fabricated with different film
   composition and annealing temperature. The devices exhibit percolation
   conduction with Fermi level pinning at high charge carrier
   concentrations. The shape and energy levels of band-tail states can be
   engineered by process and stoichiometry. For optimal amorphous ZTO film
   with Zn:Sn ink ratio of 7: 3 and annealing temperature of 480 degrees C,
   the band structure exhibits Arrhenius and percolation energy values of 7
   and 3 meV, respectively, better than those measured by others for

Abstract = {{How to simulate interior aerodynamic noise accurately is an important
   question of a car interior noise reduction. The unsteady aerodynamic
   pressure on body surfaces is proved to be the key effect factor of car
   interior aerodynamic noise control in high frequency on high speed. In
   this paper, a detail statistical energy analysis (SEA) model is built.
   And the vibra-acoustic power inputs are loaded on the model for the
   valid result of car interior noise analysis. The model is the solid
   foundation for further optimization on car interior noise control. After
   the most sensitive subsystems for the power contribution to car interior
   noise are pointed by SEA comprehensive analysis, the sound pressure
   level of car interior aerodynamic noise can be reduced by improving
   their sound and damping characteristics. The further vehicle testing
   results show that it is available to improve the interior acoustic
   performance by using detailed SEA model, which comprised by more than 80
   subsystems, with the unsteady aerodynamic pressure calculation on body
   surfaces and the materials improvement of sound/damping properties. It
   is able to acquire more than 2 dB reduction on the central frequency in
   the spectrum over 800 Hz. The proposed optimization method can be looked
   as a reference of car interior aerodynamic noise control by the detail
   SEA model integrated unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and
   sensitivity analysis of acoustic contribution.}},

Abstract = {{A battery system consists of many battery cells or modules that may have
   different characteristics. To achieve reliable, efficient, and extended
   utilization of battery systems, the battery management system (BMS) must
   keep track of individual cell-level dynamics, state of charge (SOC),
   state of health (SOH), failure status, and life-expectancy prediction.
   Current battery technology employs cell-or module-level voltage sensors,
   with high costs for sensors and packaging, and substantial reliability
   issues. This paper introduces new methods that utilize existing
   cell-balancing circuits to estimate an individual cell's voltage and
   current from battery string terminal voltage/current measurements. This
   is achieved by actively controlling balancing circuits to create partial
   observability for battery cell subsystems. Control strategies,
   estimation algorithms, and their key properties are developed. Some
   typical battery model structures are used to illustrate the usage of the
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Mode transitions are significant events in the operation of
   series-parallel hybrid electric vehicles (SPHEVs) with a clutch serving
   as the key enabling actuator element. Due to the friction-induced
   discontinuity of the clutch torque, seamless transition is difficult to
   achieve. In this paper, a model reference control (MRC) law is proposed
   to coordinate the motor torque, engine torque, and clutch torque to
   manage transitions. The control system is overactuated in the sense that
   three inputs (i.e., three torques) can be manipulated to control the two
   outputs (angular speeds of the two sides of the clutch). The effects of
   using different input combinations are analyzed to exploit the
   overactuation feature of the system, and performance sensitivities to
   various design factors are studied. The simulation and experimental
   results from an SPHEV bus demonstrate that the MRC achieves reduced
   torque interruption, less vehicle jerk, and smaller frictional losses,
   compared to the conventional operation method.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid advances in non-fouling surface technology have pushed the
   performance of novel coatings toward the detection limit of established
   protein density quantification techniques. Hence, there is an urgent
   need for more sensitive detection strategies. Previously we demonstrated
   that landing rate measurements of microtubules can reveal kinesin
   surface coverages between 0.1 and 10 mu m(-2). In this report, we
   quantify the binding kinetics of highly fluorescent markers to
   surface-adhered proteins and demonstrate the of protein surface
   densities in the range of 0.1-1000 mu m(-2). We utilize this technique
   to measure kinesin densities on casein-coated glass surfaces and
   fibrinogen densities on non-fouling polyethylene glycol methacrylate
   (PEGMA) surfaces. The use of nanospheres (i) potentially permits the
   detection of a variety of adsorbed proteins, (ii) facilitates the
   determination of the landing rate due to their uniformity, and (iii)
   extends the dynamic range of the method due to their small size.}},

Abstract = {{Current methods for studying central nervous system myelination
   necessitate permissive axonal substrates conducive to myelin wrapping by
   oligodendrocytes. We have developed a neuron-free culture system in
   which electron-spun nanofibers of varying sizes substitute for axons as
   a substrate for oligodendrocyte myelination, thereby allowing
   manipulation of the biophysical elements of axonal-oligodendroglial
   interactions. To investigate axonal regulation of myelination, this
   system effectively uncouples the role of molecular (inductive) cues from
   that of biophysical properties of the axon. We use this method to
   uncover the causation and sufficiency of fiber diameter in the
   initiation of concentric wrapping by rat oligodendrocytes. We also show
   that oligodendrocyte precursor cells display sensitivity to the
   biophysical properties of fiber diameter and initiate membrane
   ensheathment before differentiation. The use of nanofiber scaffolds will
   enable screening for potential therapeutic agents that promote
   oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination and will also provide
   valuable insight into the processes involved in remyelination.}},

Abstract = {{The development of tools for patterning cocultures of cells is a
   fundamental interest among cell biologists and tissue engineers.
   Although a variety of systems exist for micropatterning cells, the
   methods used to generate cell micropatterns are often cumbersome and
   difficult to adapt for tissue engineering purposes. This study combines
   acoustic droplet ejection and aqueous two-phase system exclusion
   patterning to introduce a method for patterning cocultures of cells in
   multiplexed arrays. This new method uses focused acoustic radiation
   pressure to eject discrete droplets of uniform size from the surface of
   a dextran solution containing cells. The size of droplets is controlled
   by adjusting ultrasound parameters, such as pulse, duration, and
   amplitude. The ejected dextran droplets are captured on a cell culture
   substrate that is manipulated by a computer-controlled 3D positioning
   system according to predesigned patterns. Polyethylene glycol solution
   containing an additional cell type is then added to the culture dish to
   produce a two-phase system capable of depositing different types of
   cells around the initial pattern of cells. We demonstrate that our
   method can produce patterns of islands or lines with two or more cell
   types. Further, we demonstrate that patterns can be multiplexed for
   studies involving combinations of multiple cell types. This method
   offers a tool to transfer cell-containing samples in a contact-free,
   nozzle-less manner, avoiding sample cross-contamination. It can be used
   to pattern cell cocultures without complicated fabrication of culture
   substrates. These capabilities were used to examine the response of
   cancer cells to the presence of a ligand (CXCL12) secreted from
   surrounding cocultured cells.}},

Abstract = {{We describe patterning of bacterial biofilms using polymer-based aqueous
   two-phase system (ATPS) microprinting protocols. The fully aqueous but
   selectively bacteria-partitioning nature of the ATPS allows spatially
   distinct localization of suspensions of bacteria such as Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa and Escherichia coli with high precision. The ATPS patterned
   bacterial suspensions form spatially distinct biofilms over time. Due to
   the fully aqueous and gentle noncontact printing procedures employed,
   coculture biofilms composed of multiple types of bacteria could be
   printed not only adjacent to each other but also directly over another
   layer of existing biofilm. In addition, the ATPS environment also allows
   free diffusion of small molecules between spatially distinct and
   localized bacterial suspensions and biofilms. This enables biofilms to
   chemically affect or be affected by neighboring biofilms or planktonic
   cells, even if they consist of different strains or species. We show
   that a beta-lactamase producing biofilm confers ampicillin resistance to
   neighboring nonresistant planktonic cells, as seen by a 3,600-fold
   increase in survival of the ampicillin-sensitive strain. These examples
   demonstrate the ability of ATPS-based biofilm patterning methods to
   enable unique studies on commensalistic effects between bacterial
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Construction projects are usually labour intensive, and human resource
   (HR) issues contribute significantly to a project's final costs. From
   this perspective, a tool that can help construction managers reduce
   their HR costs can potentially generate improvement in the project cost.
   In this paper we propose a simulation-based approach that sheds light on
   the dynamics of workforce skill evolution as the project progresses,
   thereby assisting construction managers in adjusting their HR policies.
   The proposed approach uses a system dynamics (SD) simulation model that
   dynamically tracks the effects of alternative HR policies. After the
   development and validation of the SD model, the SD model is extended to
   capture operational details and their interaction with workforce skill
   evolution, adopting a hybrid SD and discrete event simulation (DES). The
   hybrid model has been applied to an experimental case of structural
   steel fabrication projects, in which we demonstrate that there is a
   considerable room for cost-saving in HR. The hybrid modeling approach
   introduced in this paper can be employed by construction managers for
   possible improvements in HR management, as well as researchers for an
   in-depth understanding of the dynamics in workforce skill evolution.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important problems in large-scale inference problems is
   the identification of variables that are highly dependent on several
   other variables. When dependence is measured by partial correlations,
   these variables identify those rows of the partial correlation matrix
   that have several entries with large magnitudes, i.e., hubs in the
   associated partial correlation graph. This paper develops theory and
   algorithms for discovering such hubs from a few observations of these
   variables. We introduce a hub screening framework in which the user
   specifies both a minimum (partial) correlation rho and a minimum degree
   delta to screen the vertices. The choice of rho and delta can be guided
   by our mathematical expressions for the phase transition correlation
   threshold rho(c) governing the average number of discoveries. They can
   also be guided by our asymptotic expressions for familywise discovery
   rates under the assumption of large number of variables, fixed number of
   multivariate samples, and weak dependence. Under the null hypothesis
   that the dispersion (covariance) matrix is sparse, these limiting
   expressions can be used to enforce familywise error constraints and to
   rank the discoveries in order of increasing statistical significance.
   For n << p, the computational complexity of the proposed partial
   correlation screening method is low and is therefore highly scalable.
   Thus, it can be applied to significantly larger problems than previous
   approaches. The theory is applied to discovering hubs in a
   high-dimensional gene microarray dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of posterior vaginal
   prolapse has been studied. However, the three-dimensional (3-D)
   mechanisms causing such prolapse remain poorly understood. This
   discovery project was undertaken to identify the different 3-D
   characteristics of models of rectocele-type posterior vaginal prolapse
   (PVPR) in women.
   Ten women with (cases) and ten without (controls) PVPR were selected
   from an ongoing case-control study. Supine, multiplanar MR imaging was
   performed at rest and maximal Valsalva. Three-dimensional
   reconstructions of the posterior vaginal wall and pelvic bones were
   created using 3D Slicer v. 3.4.1. In each slice the posterior vaginal
   wall and perineal skin were outlined to the anterior margin of the
   external anal sphincter to include the area of the perineal body. Women
   with predominant enteroceles or anterior vaginal prolapse were excluded.
   The case and control groups had similar demographics. In women with PVPR
   two characteristics were consistently visible (10/10): (1) the posterior
   vaginal wall displayed a folding phenomenon similar to a person
   beginning to kneel ({''}kneeling{''} shape) and (2) a downward
   displacement in the upper two thirds of the vagina. Also seen in some,
   but not all of the scans were: (3) forward protrusion of the distal
   vagina (6/10), (4) perineal descent (5/10), and (5) distal widening in
   the lower third of the vagina (3/10).
   Increased folding (kneeling) of the vagina and an overall downward
   displacement are consistently present in rectocele. Forward protrusion,
   perineal descent, and distal widening are sometimes seen as well.}},

Abstract = {{Although pneumatic actuators are widely used in industry, they have two
   major weaknesses-nonlinearities associated with compressibility of air
   and low energy efficiency. The former limits its applicability whenever
   accurate positioning is required, and the latter has a negative impact
   on users through increased energy costs. This paper addresses these
   issues with the aim of developing a widely applicable servo control
   strategy, which combines improved tracking accuracy and energy
   efficiency. A detailed actuator system model is linearized through
   nonlinear input-output feedback linearization, and the energy optimal
   velocity profile is derived. Simulation and experimental studies
   indicate that energy efficiency improvements of 3-7\% are possible,
   while tracking accuracy can be ensured. The method is suitable for
   real-time implementation and is cost effective; it requires the
   implementation of an improved velocity profile, while hardware
   components do not need to be altered. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006084]}},

Abstract = {{We propose a solution to the image deconvolution problem where the

   blind deconvolution of natural images, we assume the image is sparse in
   the pixel basis, a natural sparsity arising in magnetic resonance force
   microscopy (MRFM). Our approach adopts a Bayesian
   Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling framework. The performance of our
   Bayesian semi-blind algorithm for sparse images is superior to
   previously proposed semi-blind algorithms such as the alternating
   minimization algorithm and blind algorithms developed for natural
   images. We illustrate our myopic algorithm on real MRFM tobacco virus

Abstract = {{In this paper, linear canonical correlation analysis (LCCA) is
   generalized by applying a structured transform to the joint probability
   distribution of the considered pair of random vectors, i.e., a
   transformation of the joint probability measure defined on their joint
   observation space. This framework, called measure transformed canonical
   correlation analysis (MTCCA), applies LCCA to the data after
   transformation of the joint probability measure. We show that judicious
   choice of the transform leads to a modified canonical correlation
   analysis, which, in contrast to LCCA, is capable of detecting non-linear
   relationships between the considered pair of random vectors. Unlike
   kernel canonical correlation analysis, where the transformation is
   applied to the random vectors, in MTCCA the transformation is applied to
   their joint probability distribution. This results in performance
   advantages and reduced implementation complexity. The proposed approach
   is illustrated for graphical model selection in simulated data having
   non-linear dependencies, and for measuring long-term associations
   between companies traded in the NASDAQ and NYSE stock markets.}},

Abstract = {{Emphasis on effective demand management is becoming increasingly
   recognized as an important factor in operations performance. Operations
   models that account for supply costs and constraints as well as a
   supplier's ability to influence demand characteristics can lead to an
   improved match between supply and demand. This paper presents a class of
   optimization models that allow a supplier to select, from a set of
   potential markets, those markets that provide maximum profit when
   production/procurement economies of scale exist in the supply process.
   The resulting optimization problem we study possesses an interesting
   structure and we show that although the general problem is -complete, a
   number of relevant and practical special cases can be solved in
   polynomial time. We also provide a computationally very efficient and
   intuitively attractive heuristic solution procedure that performs
   extremely well on a large number of test instances.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops exact and heuristic algorithms for a stochastic
   knapsack problem where items with random sizes may be assigned to a
   knapsack. An item's value is given by the realization of the product of
   a random unit revenue and the random item size. When the realization of
   the sum of selected item sizes exceeds the knapsack capacity, a penalty
   cost is incurred for each unit of overflow, while our model allows for a
   salvage value for each unit of capacity that remains unused. We seek to
   maximize the expected net profit resulting from the assignment of items
   to the knapsack. Although the capacity is fixed in our core model, we
   show that problems with random capacity, as well as problems in which
   capacity is a decision variable subject to unit costs, fall within this
   class of problems as well. We focus on the case where item sizes are
   independent and normally distributed random variables, and provide an
   exact solution method for a continuous relaxation of the problem. We
   show that an optimal solution to this relaxation exists containing no
   more than two fractionally selected items, and develop a customized
   branch-and-bound algorithm for obtaining an optimal binary solution. In
   addition, we present an efficient heuristic solution method based on our
   algorithm for solving the relaxation and empirically show that it
   provides high-quality solutions.}},

Abstract = {{A concept has been proposed for focusing underwater energy. An array of
   independently detonated spherical TNT charges has been suggested to
   achieve this aim. The goal of the present research effort is to model
   this system and identify optimal array geometry and detonation timing. A
   reduced-order model must be developed due to the highly iterative nature
   of most optimization algorithms. The fast computational speed required
   by the optimization problem renders the use of the sophisticated
   numerical solvers impractical. An analytical, physics-based model must
   be developed to satisfy the computational time and accuracy demands of
   the multiple charge problem. This model must capture shock propagation
   speed, pressure-time histories throughout the fluid domain, and shock
   wave interaction phenomena. Such a model is presented herein.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To compare the number and density of lung metastases in
   histotripsy-treated and control subjects. Histotripsy is a noninvasive,
   nonthermal, pulsed ultrasound technology that produces targeted
   mechanical tissue fractionation. Histotripsy ablation of renal implanted
   VX-2 tumor has been previously demonstrated; however, concerns have been
   raised that mechanical forces associated with histotripsy might result
   in unwanted metastatic dissemination of tumor.
   METHODS VX-2 tumor was implanted into the left kidneys of New Zealand
   White rabbits. Twenty rabbits were treated with histotripsy on day 13; 8
   were maintained as controls. All rabbits underwent left nephrectomy on
   day 14. Lungs were harvested and processed for histopathologic
   inspection on day 19. Whole-mount coronal lung sections were examined to
   determine the number of metastases and metastatic density.
   RESULTS Tumors grew after implantation in all 28 cases and were
   localized with ultrasound in 19 of 20 subjects before treatment.
   Histology confirmed fractionation of tumor in all treatment rabbits. The
   number of lung metastases (88.7 vs 72.5; P = .29) and the metastatic
   density (8.9 vs 7.0 mets/cm(2); P = .22) were not statistically
   different between treatment and control rabbits.
   CONCLUSION Histotripsy of renal implanted VX-2 tumor in an in-vivo
   rabbit model did not produce a statistically significant increase in
   number or density of lung metastasis. Data suggesting a trend toward
   increased metastases after histotripsy are overwhelmed by the high
   baseline rate of metastases in this aggressive tumor model. Further
   investigation using less aggressive tumor models is indicated to clarify
   this relationship. UROLOGY 80: 724-729, 2012. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility and healing response to
   urethral-sparing prostate histotripsy using a canine model of benign
   prostatic hypertrophy.
   METHODS Histotripsy was performed on 10 canines using a 750-kHz
   piezoelectric ultrasound transducer targeting the prostatic parenchyma
   while avoiding the urethra. Periprocedure prostatic urethral integrity
   was evaluated with serial cystourethroscopy. Evolution of histotripsy
   treatment effect and subjects' response to urethral sparing was
   evaluated with serial ultrasound and laboratory evaluation,
   respectively. The dogs were euthanized acutely or chronically and
   findings were confirmed histologically.
   RESULTS Bilateral treatment was possible in 8/10 subjects, whereas
   unilateral treatment was performed in 2/10. Failure to spare the urethra
   was observed in 2/18 treatments-one acutely and one chronically, despite
   normal cystourethroscopy for the first week. Modest prostatic volume
   reduction was seen in subjects survived to 8 weeks post histotripsy.
   Laboratory studies revealed transient perioperative increases in mean
   white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase.
   On histology, 80\% of successful urethral sparing treatment cavities
   were completely epithelialized, containing simple fluid with minimal
   cellular debris at 8 weeks despite no communication with the urethra.
   CONCLUSION Urethral-sparing histotripsy of the prostate is feasible and
   well tolerated in a canine model, resulting in modest volume reduction
   and prompt resorption of homogenized tissue debris. Human studies to
   evaluate the clinical utility and symptomatic response of urethral
   sparing are needed. UROLOGY 80: 730-735, 2012. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidic devices fabricated using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)
   polymer are routinely used for in vitro cell culture for a wide range of
   cellular assays. These assays typically involve the incubation of
   cultured cells with a drug molecule or a fluorescent marker while
   monitoring a cellular response. The accuracy of these assays depends on
   achieving a consistent and reproducible concentration of solute
   molecules in solution. However, hydrophobic therapeutic and fluorescent
   molecules tend to diffuse into the PDMS walls of the microfluidic
   devices, which reduce their concentration in solution and consequently
   affect the accuracy and reliability of these assays. In this paper, we
   quantitatively investigate the relationship between the partition
   coefficient (log P) of a series of markers routinely used in in vitro
   cellular assays including {[}3H]-dexamethasone, {[}3H]-diazepam,
   {[}14C]-mannitol, {[}3H]-phenytoin, and rhodamine 6G and their
   absorption into PDMS microfluidic channels. Our results show that the
   absorption of a given solute into PDMS depends on the
   hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance defined by its log P value.
   Specifically, results demonstrate that molecules with log P less than
   2.47 exhibit minimal absorption (< 10\%) into PDMS channels whereas
   molecules with log P larger than 2.62 exhibit extensive absorption (>
   90\%) into PDMS channels. Further investigations showed that TiO2 and
   glass coatings of PDMS channels reduced the absorption of hydrophobic
   molecules (log P > 2.62) by 2- and 4.5-folds, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Tasks like search-and-rescue and urban reconnaissance benefit from large
   numbers of robots working together, but high levels of autonomy are
   needed to reduce operator requirements to practical levels. Reducing the
   reliance of such systems on human operators presents a number of
   technical challenges, including automatic task allocation, global state
   and map estimation, robot perception, path planning, communications, and
   human-robot interfaces. This paper describes our 14-robot team, which
   won the MAGIC 2010 competition. It was designed to perform urban
   reconnaissance missions. In the paper, we describe a variety of
   autonomous systems that require minimal human effort to control a large
   number of autonomously exploring robots. Maintaining a consistent global
   map, which is essential for autonomous planning and for giving humans
   situational awareness, required the development of fast loop-closing,
   map optimization, and communications algorithms. Key to our approach was
   a decoupled centralized planning architecture that allowed individual
   robots to execute tasks myopically, but whose behavior was coordinated
   centrally. We will describe technical contributions throughout our
   system that played a significant role in its performance. We will also
   present results from our system both from the competition and from
   subsequent quantitative evaluations, pointing out areas in which the
   system performed well and where interesting research problems remain.

Abstract = {{The estimation of the decay function (i.e., Ke(alpha t)Phi; see equation
   (2)) for time delay systems has been a long-standing problem. Most
   existing methods focus on dominant decay rate (i.e., alpha) estimation,
   i.e., the estimation of the rightmost eigenvalue. Although some
   frequency domain approaches, such as bifurcation or finite dimensional
   approximation approaches are able to approximate the optimal decay rate
   computationally, the estimation of the factor, K, requires knowledge of
   the system trajectory over time and cannot be obtained from the
   frequency domain alone. The existing time domain approaches, such as
   matrix measure/norm or Lyapunov approaches, yield conservative estimates
   of decay rate. Furthermore, the factor K in the Lyapunov approaches is
   typically not optimized.
   A new Lambert W-function-based approach for estimation of the decay
   function for time delay systems is presented. This new approach is able
   to provide a closed-form solution for time delay systems in terms of an
   infinite series. Using this solution form, the optimal decay rate,
   alpha, and an estimate of the corresponding factor, K, can be obtained.
   Less conservative estimates of the decay function can lead to more
   accurate description of the exponential behavior of time delay systems,
   and more effective control design based on those results. The method is
   illustrated with several examples, and results compare favorably with
   existing methods for decay function estimation.}},

Title = {{Impact of Compressed Sensing With Quantization on UWB Receivers With
   Multipath Channel Estimation}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the application of compressive sensing (CS) for
   ultra wide band (UWB) communication. Channel estimation is an important
   aspect for any communication system and especially for UWB systems in
   order to appropriately collect the energy from the multipath channel.
   UWB generally requires a high sampling rate since the bandwidth is
   large. Channel estimation using CS is studied along with its impact on
   reducing the sampling rate for an ADC to reduce power. Practical issues
   regarding the effect of quantization on channel estimation are addressed
   and a hardware implementation for CS based on theWalsh-Hadamard
   transform (WHT) allowing sub-Nyquist sampling is proposed. To separate
   the effect of channel estimation with CS, the performance of the
   sub-Nyquist ADC is studied in a noiseless and multipath free channel and
   design decisions are discussed. Comparison with the Nyquist ADC shows
   that using the sub-Nyquist ADC reduce power by a factor of about 6X. For
   the proposed hardware, two receiver architectures based on matched
   filtering and filtering in the compressed domain (so-called ``smashed
   filtering{''}) are studied. It is found that with a perfect channel
   smashed filtering performs better than matched filtering. Finally the
   effect of channel estimation on the proposed hardware is studied along
   with two different recovery algorithms namely basis pursuit and matching
   pursuit.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low-power, time-based, compressive sampling
   architecture for analog-to-digital conversion. A random
   pulse-position-modulation (PPM) analog-to-digital conversion (ADC)
   architecture is proposed. A prototype 9-bit random PPM ADC incorporating
   a pseudo-random sampling scheme is implemented as proof of concept. This
   approach leverages the energy efficiency of time-based processing. The
   use of sampling techniques that exploit signal compressibility leads to
   further improvements in efficiency. The random PPM
   (pulse-position-modulation) ADC employs compressive sampling techniques
   to efficiently sample at sub-Nyquist rates. The sub-sampled signal is
   recovered using a reconstruction algorithm, which is tailored for
   practical hardware implementation. We develop a theoretical analysis of
   the hardware architecture and the reconstruction algorithm. Measurements
   of a prototype random PPM ADC and simulation, demonstrate this theory.
   The prototype successfully demonstrates a 90\% reduction in sampling
   rate compared to the Nyquist rate for input signals that are 3\% sparse
   in frequency domain.}},

Abstract = {{This article reviews the tailoring of engineered cementitious composites

   fiber/matrix interfaces to attain tensile ductility in ECC. If
   conditions for controlled multiple cracking are disturbed by the need to
   introduce ingredients to attain a special attribute or function,
   micromechanics then serve as a systematic and rational means to
   efficiently recover composite tensile ductility. Three examples of ECCs
   with attributes of lightweight, high early strength, and self-healing
   functions, are used to illustrate these tailoring concepts. The
   fundamental approach, however, is broadly applicable to a wide variety

Abstract = {{WiFi interface is known to be a primary energy consumer in mobile
   devices, and idle listening (IL) is the dominant source of energy
   consumption in WiFi. Most existing protocols, such as the 802.11
   power-saving mode (PSM), attempt to reduce the time spent in IL by sleep
   scheduling. However, through an extensive analysis of real-world
   traffic, we found more than 60 percent of energy is consumed in IL, even
   with PSM enabled. To remedy this problem, we propose Energy-Minimizing
   idle Listening (E-MiLi) that reduces the power consumption in IL, given
   that the time spent in IL has already been optimized by sleep
   scheduling. Observing that radio power consumption decreases
   proportionally to its clock rate, E-MiLi adaptively downclocks the radio
   during IL, and reverts to full clock rate when an incoming packet is
   detected or a packet has to be transmitted. E-MiLi incorporates sampling
   rate invariant detection, ensuring accurate packet detection and address
   filtering even when the receiver's sampling clock rate is much lower
   than the signal bandwidth. Further, it employs an opportunistic
   downclocking mechanism to optimize the efficiency of switching clock
   rate, based on a simple interface to existing MAC-layer scheduling
   protocols. We have implemented E-MiLi on the USRP software radio
   platform. Our experimental evaluation shows that E-MiLi can detect
   packets with close to 100 percent accuracy even with downclocking by a
   factor of 16. When integrated with 802.11, E-MiLi can reduce energy
   consumption by around 44 percent for 92 percent of users in real-world
   wireless networks.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal management is important for the efficient operation of organic
   light-emitting diodes (OLED, or PHOLED) at high brightness, with the
   device operating temperature influencing both lifetime and performance.
   We apply a transmission-matrix approach to analytically model the
   effects of thermal conduction, convection and radiation on OLED
   temperature. The model predictions match experiment without requiring
   the use of fitting parameters. This allows for the simulation of the
   thermal response of various device architectures, materials combinations
   and environmental factors under a variety of operating conditions. Using
   these simulations, we find that 87\% of the heat is dissipated through
   the air space adjacent to the glass package cap. Furthermore, an air gap
   between the device cathode and cap provides a significant thermal
   impedance. Minimizing the thickness of the internal air gap can lead to
   nearly room temperature operation, even at very high brightness. (C)

Abstract = {{HC and CO emissions in a premixed low-temperature combustion mode fueled
   by blends of diesel and gasoline are investigated in this study. Tests
   were conducted on a single-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine, with
   gasoline proportion in fuel blends and engine control parameters (EGR
   rate, intake pressure and injection pressure) adjusted to investigate
   their influences on HC and CO emissions of this premixed low-temperature
   combustion mode. It is found that changes in fuel composition and engine
   parameters affect ignition delay and global equivalence ratio, which are
   closely tied to HC and CO emissions, respectively. The methods that
   extend ignition delay, such as increasing EGR rate, increasing gasoline
   proportion in fuel blends, or reducing intake pressure, cause increased
   HC emissions. In contrast, for most cases, CO emissions are dominated by
   global equivalence ratio, which is mainly adjusted by EGR and intake
   pressure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Imagery in cognitive architecture: Representation and control at
   multiple levels of abstraction}},
Journal = {{COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19-20}},
Pages = {{1-29}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{In a cognitive architecture, intelligent behavior is contingent upon the
   use of an appropriate abstract representation of the task. When
   designing a general-purpose cognitive architecture, two basic challenges
   related to abstraction arise, which are introduced and examined in this
   article. The perceptual abstraction problem results from the difficulty
   of creating a single perception system able to induce appropriate
   abstract representations in any task the agent might encounter, and the
   irreducibility problem arises because some tasks are resistant to being
   abstracted at all. The first contribution of this paper is identifying
   these problems, and the second contribution is showing a means to
   address them. This is accomplished through the use of mental imagery.
   To support imagery, a concrete (highly detailed) representation of the
   spatial state of the problem is maintained as an intermediate between
   the external world and an abstract representation. Actions can be
   simulated (imagined) in terms of this concrete representation, and the
   agent can derive abstract information by applying perceptual processes
   to the resulting concrete state. Imagery works to mitigate the
   perceptual abstraction problem by allowing a given perception system to
   work in a wider variety of tasks, since perception can be dynamically
   combined with imagery, and works to mitigate the irreducibility problem
   by allowing internal simulation of low-level control processes.
   To demonstrate these benefits, an implementation is described, which is
   an extension of the Soar architecture. An agent in this architecture
   that uses reinforcement learning and imagery to play an arcade game and
   an agent that performs sampling-based motion planning for a car-like
   vehicle are described, demonstrating the perceptual abstraction and
   irreducibility problems and the associated use of imagery to mitigate
   those problems in complex AI tasks.
   Previous AI systems have incorporated imagery-like processes, however,
   the functional benefit of imagery in those systems has typically been
   characterized as the ability to perform more efficient inference through
   the use of a specialized representation. The use of imagery here shows
   further benefits related to the perceptual abstraction and
   irreducibility problems, enriching the broader understanding of the role
   of imagery in cognitive systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigates numerical modeling of surface generation in
   microgrinding of ceramic materials by coupled trajectory and finite
   element analysis. The resultant surface generation from both ductile
   flow mode grinding and fracture mode grinding is modeled in
   microgrinding of alumina. In the ductile flow mode grinding, the surface
   generation is simulated by trajectory analysis. In the fracture mode
   grinding, the surface generation is estimated from the fully damaged
   subsurface depth by cohesive zone method (CZM) based FEA simulation. The
   simulated surface profile matches well with the experimental result in
   the arithmetic average surface roughness. However, larger error is
   observed in the root mean squared surface roughness at high feed rate.
   It is suspected that this is caused by the increased vibration in
   microgrinding at high feed rate, which increases the complexity in the
   ground surface. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An original approach to cluster multi-component data sets is proposed
   that includes an estimation of the number of clusters. Using Prim's
   algorithm to construct a minimal spanning tree (MST) we show that, under
   the assumption that the vertices are approximately distributed according
   to a spatial homogeneous Poisson process, the number of clusters can be
   accurately estimated by thresholding the sequence of edge lengths added
   to the MST by Prim's algorithm. This sequence, called the Prim
   trajectory, contains sufficient information to determine both the number
   of clusters and the approximate locations of the cluster centroids. The
   estimated number of clusters and cluster centroids are used to
   initialize the generalized Lloyd algorithm, also known as k-means, which
   circumvents its well known initialization problems. We evaluate the
   false positive rate of our cluster detection algorithm, using Poisson
   approximations in Euclidean spaces. Applications of this method in the
   multi/hyper-spectral imagery domain to a satellite view of Paris and to
   an image of Mars are also presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{As a part of their planning process, airlines construct lines-of-flight
   (LOFs) - daily repeating sequences of flights, each of which will be
   flown by a single aircraft. In the week leading up to the actual
   day-of-operations, these LOFs are then assigned to specific aircraft
   (tails), forming multi-day aircraft routings that in turn enable the
   scheduling of routine maintenance checks. Operational disruptions,
   however, can lead to deviations from these routings, which in turn
   disrupt the maintenance plan. The goal of our research is to improve the
   construction of LOFs so as to increase the likelihood of being able to
   recover from maintenance disruptions without costly over-the-day
   aircraft swaps. We present a new metric, maintenance reachability (MR),
   which measures the robustness of a planned set of LOFs, and develop a
   mathematical programming approach to improving the MR of a given set of
   LOFs. We provide computational results based on data from a major U.S.
   carrier demonstrating that significant improvements in MR can be
   achieved with only a small number of changes to the original set of
   LOFs. Finally, we conclude by showing that even under imperfect input
   data, MR can be improved relative to a planned set of LOFs. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The future development of bio-integrated devices will improve the
   functionality of robotic prosthetic limbs. A critical step in the
   advancement of bio-integrated prostheses will be establishing long-term,
   secure fixation to the remnant bone. To overcome limitations associated
   with contemporary bone-anchored prosthetic limbs, we established a
   paradigm for developing and fabricating novel orthopedic implants
   undergoing specified loading. A topology optimization scheme was
   utilized to generate optimal implant macrostructures that minimize
   deformations near the bone-implant interface. Variations in implant
   characteristics and interfacial connectivity were investigated to
   examine how these variables influence the layout of the optimized
   implant. For enhanced tissue integration, the optimally designed
   macroscopic geometry of a titanium (Ti)-alloy implant was further
   modified by introducing optimized microstructures. The complex
   geometries of selected implants were successfully fabricated using
   selective laser sintering (SLS) technology. Fabrication accuracy was
   assessed by comparing volumes and cross-sectional areas of fabricated
   implants to CAD data. The error of fabricated volume to CAD design
   volume was less than 8\% and differences in cross sectional areas
   between SEM images of fabricated implants and corresponding cross
   sections from CAD design were on average less than 9\%. We have
   demonstrated that this computational design method, combined with solid
   freeform fabrication techniques, provides a versatile way to develop
   novel orthopedic implants. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},
