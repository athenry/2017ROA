Title = {{A-Train-Based Case Study of Stratiform-Convective Transition within a
   Warm Conveyor Belt}},

Abstract = {{Clouds are both produced by and interact with the mesoscale and
   synoptic-scale structure of extratropical cyclones (ETCs) in ways that
   are still not well understood. Cloud-scale radiative and latent heating
   modifies the thermal environment, leading to a response in the dynamics
   that can in turn feed back on cloud distribution and microphysical
   properties. Key to the structure of ETCs is the warm conveyor belt
   (WCB); the poleward-ascending airstream that produces the bulk of the
   clouds and precipitation. This paper examines a long-lived WCB that
   persisted over the western North Atlantic Ocean in nearly the same
   location for several days. During this time, the storm was sampled
   multiple times by NASA's A-Train satellite constellation, and a clear
   transition from stratiform to convective clouds was observed.
   Examination of coincident temperature and water vapor data reveals
   destabilization of the thermodynamic profile after the cyclone reached
   maturity. CloudSat radar reflectivity from two sequential overpasses of
   the warm front depicts a change from stratiform to convective cloud
   structure, and high-frequency microwave data reveal an increase in the
   amount of ice hydrometeors. The presence of convection may serve to
   strengthen the warm frontal trough while slowing the movement of the
   primary low pressure center. The stratiform-convective transition cannot
   be detected from passive measurements of cloud-top pressure. The results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of multivariate satellite observations for
   examining the outcome of dynamic processes in ETCs, and highlight the
   need for more rapid temporal profiling in future remote sensing
   observing systems.}},

Title = {{On the non-uniqueness of the hydro-geomorphic responses in a zero-order
   catchment with respect to soil moisture}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{73-89}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study advances mechanistic interpretation of predictability
   challenges in hydro-geomorphology related to the role of soil moisture
   spatial variability. Using model formulations describing the physics of
   overland flow, variably saturated subsurface flow, and erosion and
   sediment transport, this study explores (1) why a basin with the same
   mean soil moisture can exhibit distinctly different spatial moisture
   distributions, (2) whether these varying distributions lead to
   non-unique hydro-geomorphic responses, and (3) what controls
   non-uniqueness in relation to the response type. Two sets of numerical
   experiments are carried out with two physically-based models, HYDRUS and
   tRIBS+VEGGIE+FEaST, and their outputs are analyzed with respect to
   pre-storm moisture state. The results demonstrate that distinct spatial
   moisture distributions for the same mean wetness arise because
   near-surface soil moisture dynamics exhibit different degrees of
   coupling with deeper-soil moisture and the process of subsurface
   drainage. The consequences of such variations are different depending on
   the type of hydrological response. Specifically, if the predominant
   runoff response is of infiltration excess type, the degree of
   non-uniqueness is related to the spatial distribution of near-surface
   moisture. If runoffis governed by subsurface stormflow, the extent of
   deep moisture contributing area and its ``readiness to drain{''}
   determine the response characteristics. Because the processes of erosion
   and sediment transport superimpose additional controls over factors
   governing runoff generation and overland flow, non-uniqueness of the
   geomorphic response can be highly dampened or enhanced. The explanation
   is sediment composed by multi-size particles can alternate states of
   mobilization or surface shielding and the transient behavior is
   inherently intertwined with the availability of mobile particles. We
   conclude that complex nonlinear dynamics of hydro-geomorphic processes
   are inherent expressions of physical interactions. As complete knowledge
   of watershed properties, states, or forcings will always present the
   ultimate, if ever resolvable, challenge, deterministic predictability
   will remain handicapped. Coupling of uncertainty quantification methods
   and space-time physics-based approaches will need to evolve to
   facilitate mechanistic interpretations and informed practical
   applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Research on multimodal information processing has seen a surge in recent
   years. Most of this research suffers from a significant shortcoming: the
   failure to perform crossmodal matching. Crossmodal matching refers to
   equating perceived intensities of stimuli across two sensory modalities.
   This step is critical for avoiding that modality is confounded with
   other signal properties. Very few studies include this step, and there
   is no agreed-upon matching technique. An experiment comparing two
   different approaches shows that even minor variations can lead to
   significant differences in match values and intraindividual match
   variability. Our findings highlight the need for developing and
   employing a valid crossmodal matching procedure for future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To propose a standard measuring protocol for type B aortic
   dissections so as to improve comparability between studies reporting
   aortic dimensions. Methods: Fifteen computed tomography (CT) scans of
   type B aortic dissections were measured with a standard protocol by 2
   independent observers using postprocessing software. The following
   parameters were assessed: true, false, and total lumen diameter; true
   and false lumen volume; and entry tear size, location, and number.
   Diameters were measured in a perpendicular plane at 2, 10, and 20 cm
   from the left subclavian artery and 5 cm from the most distal renal
   artery. True lumen volume was assessed from the left subclavian artery
   to the aortic bifurcation, while the false lumen volume was from the
   start to end up to the aortic bifurcation. Entry tear location was
   assessed in relation to the left subclavian artery. Intra- and
   interobserver repeatability and agreement were evaluated using the
   Bland-Altman method, an a priori set of acceptable differences, and
   Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC). Results: Intra- and
   interobserver mean differences for aortic diameter and true and false
   lumen volumes were generally within the limits of agreement and the a
   priori differences; the LCCC showed excellent agreement. Entry tear
   location, size, and number were difficult to measure in a repeatable
   manner, with inconsistent correlation coefficients, especially between
   the 2 observers. Conclusion: This protocol showed acceptable
   repeatability for aortic diameter and aortic volume measurements.
   Assessment of entry tears proved challenging and associated with less
   favorable results. Additionally, investigators are urged to be more
   transparent regarding the measurement methodology used in studies
   describing aortic dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Process-based hydrological models have a long history dating back to the
   1960s. Criticized by some as over-parameterized, overly complex, and
   difficult to use, a more nuanced view is that these tools are necessary
   in many situations and, in a certain class of problems, they are the
   most appropriate type of hydrological model. This is especially the case
   in situations where knowledge of flow paths or distributed state
   variables and/or preservation of physical constraints is important.
   Examples of this include: spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture,
   groundwater flow and runoff generation, sediment and contaminant
   transport, or when feedbacks among various Earth's system processes or
   understanding the impacts of climate non-stationarity are of primary
   concern. These are situations where process-based models excel and other
   models are unverifiable. This article presents this pragmatic view in
   the context of existing literature to justify the approach where
   applicable and necessary. We review how improvements in data
   availability, computational resources and algorithms have made detailed
   hydrological simulations a reality. Avenues for the future of
   process-based hydrological models are presented suggesting their use as
   virtual laboratories, for design purposes, and with a powerful treatment
   of uncertainty. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Freezing-thawing (F-T) exposure produces higher absorption in concrete
   than an isothermal condition. This work investigated the moisture
   absorption characteristics in different air-entrained concrete mixtures
   under two exposure conditions (water and a 3\% salt solution) by
   simultaneously monitoring the weight change, mass loss and internal
   damage of 100 x 100 x 70 mm concrete blocks subjected to repetitive F-T
   cycles. The results indicate that permanent bulk moisture uptake is
   primarily a result of the accelerated saturation of poorly connected
   capillary pores, the slow filling of entrained air voids in concrete
   mixes with sufficient air entrainment, or the re-saturation of newly
   generated cracks in concrete with poor frost resistance. No detectable
   discrepancy was observed in moisture uptake between water and salt
   exposures, but the mass loss difference was found to be substantial. The
   measured bulk absorption is not a reliable predictor for salt frost
   scaling resistance, since it reflects the universal moisture condition
   in the specimen while scaling deterioration is dominated by the degree
   of saturation in a thin surface region.}},

Abstract = {{Thixomolding and thermomechanical processing (TTMP) is a pathway through
   which it is possible to produce Mg alloy sheet with both a fine grain
   size and a weak basal texture. Following static recrystallization, the
   texture of TTMP AZ61 is comparable to that of rare-earth Mg alloy
   sheets. The beta-Mg17Al12 particles in the alloy serve several important
   roles. Pinning during rolling retards dynamic recrystallization, thereby
   preventing the development of the typical Mg sheet deformation texture.
   Recrystallized grains form near clusters of beta-particles and in the
   grain mantle regions. Larger beta-particles pin boundaries during
   subsolvus thermal exposures and therefore provide grain size stability
   during annealing. The size and spatial arrangement of the beta-particles
   are relatively stable during processing, so modifications to optimize
   the texture reduction or grain size stability would require changes in
   composition or modifications in the Thixomolding parameters.}},

   in viscous flow}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a reduced-order model (ROM) of the flow-induced
   vibrations of a flexible cantilevered hydrofoil is developed and used to
   design an active feedback controller. The ROM is developed using data
   from high-fidelity viscous fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations
   and includes nonlinear terms to accurately capture the effect of
   lock-in. An active linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is
   designed based on a linearization of the ROM and is implemented in
   simulation with the ROM and the high-fidelity viscous FSI model. A
   controller saturation method is also presented that ensures that the
   control force applied to the system remains within a prescribed range.
   Simulation results demonstrate that the LQG controller successfully
   suppresses vibrations in both the ROM and viscous FSI simulations using
   a reasonable amount of control force.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the trade-offs involved in assessing lifetime cost for
   engineering systems requires understanding trends in various engineering
   disciplines that require significantly different analysis methods to
   efficiently explore. The corresponding design spaces can be flat,
   defined by weak minima, and thus difficult to understand using
   traditixonal optimization methods. This paper presents a new
   multi-disciplinary framework that uses a goal-programming enhanced
   multi-objective collaborative optimization (eMOCO) approach to
   facilitate the development of the spaces. In order to further increase
   its efficiency in discrete or flat spaces well-suited to evolutionary
   optimization a unique discipline level genetic algorithm is proposed.
   Naval vessels are an example of an engineering system that has a
   difficult design space with respect to lifetime cost, however, one where
   it is critical to understand. As these costs are increasing, they are
   becoming limiting factors in a vessel's operational life. Though they
   are so important, the interaction between different cost categories such
   as production and operation has not been explored in depth and is not
   always clear. Understanding the trade-offs between different aspects of
   a vessel's total ownership costs early in the design stage can aid in
   the production of new ships where they are minimized. The proposed
   framework is verified on mathematical problems, and then used to develop
   trade-spaces between resistance and production for a nominal naval
   combatant vessel. These trade-spaces show both the knowledge gained by
   designers in understanding these trade-offs and the ability of the
   proposed eMOCO framework to develop them effectively.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of engineering education research provides an opportunity
   for cross-fertilisation of ideas and creativity, but it also can result
   in fragmentation of the field and duplication of effort. One solution is
   to establish a standardised taxonomy of engineering education terms to
   map the field and communicate and connect research initiatives. This
   report describes the process for developing such a taxonomy, the EER
   Taxonomy. Although the taxonomy focuses on engineering education
   research in the United States, inclusive efforts have engaged 266
   individuals from 149 cities in 30 countries during one multiday
   workshop, 7 conference sessions, and several other virtual and in-person
   activities. The resulting taxonomy comprises 455 terms arranged in 14
   branches and 6 levels. This taxonomy was found to satisfy four criteria
   for validity and reliability: (1) keywords assigned to a set of
   abstracts were reproducible by multiple researchers, (2) the taxonomy
   comprised terms that could be selected as keywords to fully describe 243
   articles in 3 journals, (3) the keywords for those 243 articles were
   evenly distributed across the branches of the taxonomy, and (4) the
   authors of 31 conference papers agreed with 90\% of researcher-assigned
   keywords. This report also describes guidelines developed to help
   authors consistently assign keywords for their articles by encouraging
   them to choose terms from three categories: (1) context/focus/topic, (2)
   purpose/target/motivation, and (3) research approach.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Cross-coupling control (CCC), which acts on contour error, is intended
   to improve contouring precision of multiaxis servosystems. The contour
   error estimate (CEE) significantly affects contouring precision.
   Conventional CEE methods rely on static single-point techniques to
   reconstruct contour error using current position error and an estimate
   of the reference map at the lead point. The performance of such static
   CEE methods deteriorates dramatically with increasing contour feedrate
   and at sharp corners. Hence, a dynamic CEE algorithm based on the Newton
   update algorithm is proposed to achieve high-precision CEE. Since the
   convergence rate of the Newton algorithm is user assignable and
   independent of the reference contour, the proposed CEE stays almost
   identical to the contour error for vastly different feedrates or sharp
   corners. Multiaxis cross-coupling adds more design steps for the
   position control loops. Therefore, in this paper, feedback signals are
   modified such that a separate cross-coupling controller is no longer
   needed. It has been shown, analytically and experimentally, that the
   modified feedback in combination with integral sliding mode control
   provides simpler design and fewer steps in comparison to conventional
   CCC designs. Moreover, the proposed CEE and the concept of modified
   feedback together result in reduced contour error. Various experiments
   are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm at high
   feedrates and for sharp corners.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the generalized theory of phase-shifted carrier
   pulsewidth modulation (PSC-PWM) for cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converters
   and modular multilevel converters (MMCs), provides a reasonable
   classification of the PSC-PWM, and extends the possible phase-shift
   angles to full range. First, the PSC-PWM for CHB converter is classified
   into two categories by phase-shift pattern. In addition, by rigorous
   mathematical derivation, the impact law of the full-range phaseshift
   angles on harmonic minimization is obtained. And then, it is proved that
   the generalized theory is equally applicable to MMC, which also merges
   the former proposed PSC-PWM for MMCs into itself. Moreover, the harmonic
   analysis of the dead-time error voltage is discussed, which is found to
   have the same harmonic distribution as the ideal voltage, except for the
   emerging of odd-order harmonics. In summary, this generalized theory
   offers a general perspective of the PSC-PWM for CHB converter and MMC,
   and builds up a scientific and comprehensive understanding for
   researchers from both academia and industry. Finally, the analytical
   findings are sufficiently validated by simulation and experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Although recurrences and toxicity occur after vaginal cuff (VC)
   brachytherapy, little is known about dosimetry due to the inability to
   clearly visualize the VC on computed tomography (CT). T2-weighted (T2W)
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior to CT in this setting, and
   we hypothesized that it could provide previously unascertainable
   dosimetric information.
   Methods and Materials: In a cohort of 32 patients who underwent
   cylinder-based brachytherapy for endometrial cancer with available MR
   simulation images, the VC was retrospectively contoured on T2W images,
   and cases were replanned to treat the upper VC to a dose of 7
   Gy/fraction prescribed to 5 mm. Relevant dose-volume parameters for the
   VC were calculated.
   Results: T2W MRI identified significant underdosing not observed on CT
   or T1-weighted imaging. Over two-thirds (69\%) of patients had at least
   1 cm 3 of VC that received less than 75\% of the prescription dose and
   half (50\%) of patients had a least 1 cm 3 of VC that received less than
   50\% of the prescription dose. The mean minimum point dose to the VC was
   2.4 Gy, or 34\% of the intended prescription dose (range: 0.53-6.4 Gy).
   Conclusions: We identified previously unreported VC underdosing in over
   two-thirds of our patients, with most of these patients having volumes
   of undistended VC that received less than half of the prescription dose.
   The maximum dimension was along the craniocaudal axis in some patients
   or left-right/anterior-posterior axis in others, suggesting that suture
   material may be restricting access to the vaginal apex and that
   alternative applicators may be needed when the diameter of the apex is
   larger than the introitus. Additional follow-up will be needed to
   determine whether underdosing is associated with isolated VC failure or
   whether low failure rates across the cohort suggest that some patients
   are being exposed to excessive dose and unnecessary risk of toxicity.

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the intrinsic viscoelastic mechanical behavior of a
   hierarchical bio-composite, structural bamboo material, was
   experimentally investigated and correlated with its microstructural
   constituents and molecular building blocks. The macroscopic viscoelastic
   responses of bulk bamboo at ambient temperature and dehydrated condition
   were evaluated through dynamic compression experiments with various
   loading frequencies, whereas the localized viscoelasticity of bamboo's
   microstructural phases, viz, fibers and parenchyma cells, were evaluated
   separately through series of nano-indentation studies. The viscoelastic
   responses of the bamboo's building blocks were further evaluated at the
   molecular level, using the computational creep tests via constant force
   Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations. A phenomenological
   viscoelastic model was then developed to explain the observed
   microstructure viscoelastic property relationship. Based on the model
   and conducted microstructural characterizations, it was believed that
   the small evolved viscous phases within the parenchyma cells were mainly
   responsible for the smaller viscoelasticity in bulk bamboo at lower
   loading frequencies, whereas the exhibited larger viscoelasticity at
   higher loading frequencies was stemmed out from the concurrent
   contribution of fibers and parenchyma cells. The findings could be
   important for understanding the intrinsic viscoelasticity in other
   biological materials with hierarchical structures, as well as for
   optimizing the design of bio-inspired composites with favorable
   structural properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Dominant backscattering mechanisms at L-band during dynamic soil
   moisture conditions for sandy soils}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {{104-112}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate dominant backscattering mechanisms under
   different soil moisture (SM) and roughness conditions for bare sandy
   soils, and discuss potential impacts on active microwave algorithms for
   soil moisture estimation. This study used ground-based observations of
   backscattering coefficient (a) over three drydown periods. Under rough
   soil conditions, surface scattering was the dominant mechanism during
   both dry and wet periods, and the sigma(0) followed a power-law
   relationship with SM, with R-2 values > 0.86. However, under smooth soil
   conditions, the relationship was negative for SM < 0.07 m(3)/m(3). A
   simple volume scattering model was used to provide plausible explanation
   for such a behavior due to volume scattering. Sensitivities of sigma(0)
   to SM using both observed and modeled sigma(0) were analyzed. The
   observed sensitivity was higher for smooth soil than that for rough
   soil, when surface scattering was the dominant mechanism, while the
   sensitivity estimated by the AIEM model was largely unaffected by
   surface roughness. Observations at VV-pol were more sensitive to SM than
   at other polarizations by up to 1 dB/0.01m(3)/m(3) for rough soil, while
   the AIEM model estimated similar sensitivities at both VV and HH-pol,
   with the maximum difference between the modeled and observed
   sensitivities of 3 dB/0.01m(3)/m(3). This study demonstrates that volume
   scattering under dry, smooth conditions and a non-linear relationship
   between sigma(0) and SM under rough conditions in sandy soils may have
   significant impacts on estimate of SM using active algorithms. (C) 2016

   actuator is bounded by a value that is less than the maximum torque that
   each actuator is able to provide, thereby disallowing actuator
   saturation. The proposed controllers are shown to render the closed-loop

   rotational demands}},
Journal = {{HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{220-230}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{During initiation of a pique turn, a dancer generates impulse to achieve
   the desired lateral translation and whole-body rotation. The goal of
   this study was to determine how individuals regulate impulse generation
   when initiating pique turns with increased rotational demands. Skilled
   dancers (n = 10) performed single (similar to 360 degrees) and double
   (similar to 720 degrees) pique turns from a stationary position. Linear
   and angular impulse generated by the push and turn legs were quantified
   using ground reaction forces and compared across turn conditions as a
   group and within a dancer using probability-based statistical methods.
   The results indicate that as the rotation demands of the pique turn
   increased, the net angular impulse generated increased whereas net
   lateral impulse decreased. Early during turn initiation, the free moment
   contributed to angular impulse generation. Later during turn initiation,
   horizontal reaction forces were controlled to generate angular impulse.
   As rotational demands increased, the moment applied increased primarily
   from redirection of the horizontal reaction force (RFh) at the push leg
   and a combination of RFh magnitude and moment arm increases at the turn
   leg. RFh at each leg were coordinated to limit unwanted net linear
   impulse. Knowledge of observed subject-specific mechanisms is important
   to inform the design of turning performance training tools. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Delivery of pharmaceuticals to the cochleae of patients with auditory
   dysfunction could potentially have many benefits from enhancing auditory
   nerve survival to protecting remaining sensory cells and their neuronal
   connections. Treatment would require platforms to enable drug delivery
   directly to the cochlea and increase the potential efficacy of
   intervention. Cochlear implant recipients are a specific patient subset
   that could benefit from local drug delivery as more candidates have
   residual hearing; and since residual hearing directly contributes to
   post-implantation hearing outcomes, it requires protection from implant
   insertion-induced trauma. This study assessed the feasibility of
   utilizing microparticles for drug delivery into cochlear fluids, testing
   persistence, distribution, biocompatibility, and drug release
   characteristics. To allow for delivery of multiple therapeutics,
   particles were composed of two distinct compartments; one containing
   polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA), and one composed of acetal-modified
   dextran and PLGA. Following in vivo infusion, image analysis revealed
   microparticle persistence in the cochlea for at least 7 days
   post-infusion, primarily in the first and second turns. The majority of
   subjects maintained or had only slight elevation in auditory brainstem
   response thresholds at 7 days post-infusion compared to pre-infusion

   and negligible immune response based on CD45+ immunolabling. When
   Piribedil-loaded microparticles were infused, Piribedil was detectable

Abstract = {{Two 9Cr-ODS steels with the same nominal composition were consolidated
   by hot isostatic pressing (HIP, named COS-1) and spark plasma sintering
   (SPS, named COS-2). Helium ions were implanted into COS-1, COS-2 and
   non-ODS Eurofer 97 steels up at 673 K. Microstructures before and after
   helium ion implantations were carefully characterized. The results show
   a bimodal grain size distribution in COS-2 and a more uniform grain size
   distribution in COS-1. Nanoscale clusters of GP-zone type Y-Ti-O and
   Y2Ti2O7 pyrochlore as well as large spinel Mn(Ti)Cr2O4 particles are all
   observed in the two ODS steels. The Y-Ti-enriched nano-oxides in COS-1
   exhibit higher number density and smaller size than in COS-2. The
   Y-Ti-enriched nano-oxides in fine grains of COS-2 show higher number
   density and smaller size than that in coarse grains of COS-2.
   Nano-oxides effectively trap helium atoms and lead to the formation of
   high density and ultra-fine helium bubbles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Methanobactins (mbs) are low-molecular-mass (< 1,200 Da) copper-binding
   peptides, or chalkophores, produced by many methane-oxidizing bacteria
   (methanotrophs). These molecules exhibit similarities to certain
   iron-binding siderophores but are expressed and secreted in response to
   copper limitation. Structurally, mbs are characterized by a pair of
   heterocyclic rings with associated thioamide groups that form the copper
   coordination site. One of the rings is always an oxazolone and the
   second ring an oxazolone, an imidazolone, or a pyrazinedione moiety. The
   mb molecule originates from a peptide precursor that undergoes a series
   of posttranslational modifications, including (i) ring formation, (ii)
   cleavage of a leader peptide sequence, and (iii) in some cases, addition
   of a sulfate group. Functionally, mbs represent the extracellular
   component of a copper acquisition system. Consistent with this role in
   copper acquisition, mbs have a high affinity for copper ions. Following
   binding, mbs rapidly reduce Cu2+ to Cu1+. In addition to binding copper,
   mbs will bind most transition metals and near-transition metals and
   protect the host methanotroph as well as other bacteria from toxic
   metals. Several other physiological functions have been assigned to mbs,
   based primarily on their redox and metal-binding properties. In this
   review, we examine the current state of knowledge of this novel type of
   metal-binding peptide. We also explore its potential applications, how
   mbs may alter the bioavailability of multiple metals, and the many roles
   mbs may play in the physiology of methanotrophs.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the electrical properties and stability of short-channel
   half-Corbino amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs).
   In the linear region, the fabricated half-Corbino a-IGZO TFT with a
   channel length of 4.5 mu m achieves a geometrical factor (f(g)) of
   similar to 2.7, a threshold voltage (V-T) of similar to 2.4 V, a
   field-effect mobility (mu(eff)) of similar to 15 cm(2)/Vs, a
   subthreshold swing (SS) of similar to 320 mV/dec and an off-current
   (I-OFF) < 10 (13) A. In the saturation region, asymmetric electrical
   characteristics such as drain current were observed under different
   drain bias conditions. The electrical properties asymmetry of
   half-Corbino a-IGZO TFTs was explained by various geometrical factors
   owing to the short-channel effect. The reduced V-T and increased SS at
   V-DS = 15 V is explained by the drain-induced Schottky barrier lowering.
   In addition, the bias-temperature stress (BTS) was performed for
   half-Corbino a-IGZO TFTs with both amorphous silicon oxide (a-SiOx)
   single layer and a-SiOx/amorphous silicon nitride (a-SiNx) bilayer
   passivation (PV) structures. The device with bilayer PV shows a
   threshold voltage shift (Delta V-T) of + 2.07 and -0.5 V under positive
   (PBTS = + 15 V) and negative BTS (NBTS = -15 V) at 70 degrees C for 10
   ks, respectively. The origins of Delta V-T during PBTS and NBTS for
   half-Corbino a-IGZO TFTs with single and bilayer PV structures were
   studied. To improve the device electrical stability, the bilayer PV
   structure should be used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We successfully immobilized enzymes onto polymer surfaces via covalent
   bonds between cysteine groups of the enzyme and dibromomaleimide
   functionalities present at the polymer surface. In this work, we used
   nitroreductase (NfsB) as a model enzyme molecule. The polymers were
   prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization, resulting in
   surfaces with dibromomaleimide groups. NfsB variants were engineered so
   that each NfsB molecule only has one cysteine group on the enzyme
   surface. Two different NfsB constructs were studied, with cysteines at
   the positions of H360 and V424, respectively. A combination of sum
   frequency generation (SFG) vibrational and attenuated total reflectance
   Fourier transformed infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopies were used to
   deduce the orientation of the immobilized enzymes on the surface. It was
   found that the orientation of the immobilized enzymes is controlled by
   the position of the cysteine residue in the protein. The NfsB H360C
   construct exhibited a similar orientational behavior on the polymer
   surface as compared to that on the self-assembled monolayer surface, but
   the NsfB V424C construct showed markedly different orientations on the
   two surfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid escape from a proposed early CH4/NH3 atmosphere on Titan could, in
   principle, limit the amount of NH3 that is converted by photolysis into
   the present N-2 atmosphere. Assuming that this conversion occurred, a
   recent estimate of escape driven by the surface temperature and pressure
   was used to constrain Titan's accretion temperature. Here we show that
   for the range of temperatures of interest, heating of the surface is not
   the primary driver for escape. Atmospheric loss from a thick Titan
   atmosphere is predominantly driven by heating of the upper atmosphere;
   therefore, the loss rate cannot be used to easily constrain the
   accretion temperature. We give an estimate of the solar driven escape
   rate from an early atmosphere on Titan, and then briefly discuss its
   relevance to the cooling rate, isotope ratios, and the time period
   suggested to convert NH3 to the present N-2 atmosphere. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Conventional resonance self-shielding methods are primarily based on
   equivalence theory, which allows the resonance integral (RI) table
   generated by homogeneous media to be useful for heterogeneous
   calculation. In the past two decades, a new RI table based directly on
   heterogeneous calculation has been developed and proved to be effective
   in the self-shielding calculation. This note compares the homogeneous
   and heterogeneous RI tables on the basis of derivation and numerical
   results. The limitations of the two RI tables and their applicability to
   the embedded self-shielding method (ESSM) are discussed. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In conjunction with Eljen Technology, Inc. (Sweetwater,TX) we have
   designed, constructed, and evaluated a 3 in. x 3 in. deuterated-xylene
   organic liquid scintillator (C8D10; EJ301D) as a fast neutron detector.
   Similar to deuterated benzene (C6D6; NE230, BC537, and E1315) this
   scintillator can provide good pulse shape discrimination between
   neutrons and gamma rays, has good timing characteristics, and can
   provide a light spectrum with peaks corresponding to discrete neutron
   energy groups up to ca. 20 MeV. Unlike benzene -based detectors,
   deuterated xylene is less volatile, less toxic, is not known to be
   carcinogenic, has a higher flashpoint, and hence is much safer for many
   applications. In addition E1301D can provide slightly more light output
   and better PSD than deuterated-benzene scintillators. We show that, as
   with deuterated-benzene scintillators, the light -response spectra can
   be unfolded to provide useable neutron energy spectra without need for
   time-of-flight (ToF). An array of these detectors arranged at many
   angles close to a reaction target can be much more effective ( x 10 to x
   100 or more) than an array of long-path ToF detectors which must utilize
   a narrowly-bunched and pulse-selected beam. As we demonstrate using a
   small Van de Graaff accelerator, measurements can thus be performed when
   a bunched and pulse -selected beam (as needed for time-of-flight) is not
   available. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{New Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) observations of small-scale (similar
   to 7 ion inertial length radius) flux transfer events (FTEs) at the
   dayside magnetopause are reported. The 10 km MMS tetrahedron size
   enables their structure and properties to be calculated using a variety
   of multispacecraft techniques, allowing them to be identified as flux
   ropes, whose flux content is small (similar to 22 kWb). The current
   density, calculated using plasma and magnetic field measurements
   independently, is found to be filamentary. Intercomparison of the plasma
   moments with electric and magnetic field measurements reveals structured
   non-frozen-in ion behavior. The data are further compared with a
   particle-in-cell simulation. It is concluded that these small-scale flux
   ropes, which are not seen to be growing, represent a distinct class of
   FTE which is generated on the magnetopause by secondary reconnection.}},

Abstract = {{We report on field-aligned current observations by the four
   Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft near the plasma sheet
   boundary layer (PSBL) during two major substorms on 23 June 2015.
   Small-scale field-aligned currents were found embedded in fluctuating
   PSBL flux tubes near the separatrix region. We resolve, for the first
   time, short-lived earthward (downward) intense field-aligned current
   sheets with thicknesses of a few tens of kilometers, which are well
   below the ion scale, on flux tubes moving equatorward/earthward during
   outward plasma sheet expansion. They coincide with upward field-aligned
   electron beams with energies of a few hundred eV. These electrons are
   most likely due to acceleration associated with a reconnection jet or
   high-energy ion beam-produced disturbances. The observations highlight
   coupling of multiscale processes in PSBL as a consequence of magnetotail
   reconnection.}},

Abstract = {{We present in situ airborne measurements of methane (CH4) and ethane
   (C2H6) taken aboard a NOAA DHC-6 Twin Otter research aircraft in May
   2014 over the Williston Basin in northwestern North Dakota, a region of
   rapidly growing oil and natural gas production. The Williston Basin is
   best known for the Bakken shale formation, from which a significant
   increase in oil and gas extraction has occurred since 2009. We derive a
   CH4 emission rate from this region using airborne data by calculating
   the CH4 enhancement flux through the planetary boundary layer downwind
   of the region. We calculate CH4 emissions of (36 +/- 13), (27 +/- 13),
   (27 +/- 12), (27 +/- 12), and (25 +/- 10) x 10(3) kg/h from five
   transects on 3 days in May 2014 downwind of the Bakken shale region of
   North Dakota. The average emission, (28 +/- 5) x 10(3) kg/h,
   extrapolates to 0.25 +/- 0.05 Tg/yr, which is significantly lower than a
   previous estimate of CH4 emissions from northwestern North Dakota and
   southeastern Saskatchewan using satellite remote sensing data. We
   attribute the majority of CH4 emissions in the region to oil and gas
   operations in the Bakken based on the similarity between atmospheric
   C2H6 to CH4 enhancement ratios and the composition of raw natural gas
   withdrawn from the region.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using laboratory-scale
   methods is essential to the development of commercial applications,
   particularly with respect to the verification of recipes that achieve
   control of CNT diameter, chirality, alignment, and density. Here, we
   report that transients in the moisture level and carbon concentration
   during the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for vertically
   aligned CNT ``forests{''} can contribute significantly to run-to-run
   variation of height and density. Then, we show that highly consistent
   CNT forest growth can be achieved by physically decoupling the catalyst
   annealing and hydrocarbon exposure steps, to allow the gas composition
   to stabilize between the steps. This decoupling is achieved using a
   magnetically actuated transfer arm to move the substrate rapidly into
   and out of the CVD reactor. Compared to a reference process where the
   sample resides in the furnace throughout the process, the decoupled
   method gives 21\% greater CNT forest height, reduces the run-to-run
   variance of height by 76\%, and results in forests with improved
   vertical alignment (Herman's orientation parameter of 0.68 compared to
   0.50). Building on this foundation, we study the influence of the
   moisture level during the CNT growth step and find a 30\% improvement in
   growth rate going from the baseline condition (<15 ppm) to 40 ppm.
   Interestingly, however, the increased moisture concentration does not
   improve the catalyst lifetime or the CNT forest density, warranting
   further study of the role of moisture on CNT nucleation versus growth.}},

   Lithium-Ion Batteries}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The energy density of current lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on
   layered LiMO2 cathodes (M = Ni, Mn, Co: NMC; M = Ni, Co, Al: NCA) needs
   to be improved significantly in order to compete with internal
   combustion engines and allow for widespread implementation of electric
   vehicles (EVs). In this report, we show that atomic layer deposition
   (ALD) of titania (TiO2) and alumina (Al2O3) on Ni-rich FCG NMC and NCA
   active material particles could substantially improve LIB performance
   and allow for increased upper cutoff voltage (UCV) during charging,
   which delivers significantly increased specific energy utilization. Our
   results show that Al2O3 coating improved the NMC cycling performance by
   40\% and the NCA cycling performance by 34\% at 1 C/-1 C with
   respectively 4.35 V and 4.4 V UCV in 2 Ah pouch cells. High resolution
   TEM/SAED structural characterization revealed that Al2O3 coatings
   prevented surface-initiated layered-to-spinel phase transitions in
   coated materials which were prevalent in uncoated materials. EIS
   confirmed that Al2O3-coated materials had significantly lower increase
   in the charge transfer component of impedance during cycling. The
   ability to mitigate degradation mechanisms for Ni-rich NMC and NCA
   illustrated in this report provides insight into a method to enable the
   performance of high-voltage LIBs.}},

Abstract = {{Improve functional quality of cartilage tissue engineered from stem
   cells requires a better understanding of the functional evolution of
   native cartilage tissue. Therefore, a biosynthetic hydrogel was
   developed containing RGD, hyaluronic acid and/or type-I collagen
   conjugated to poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate to recapitulate the
   precondensation microenvironment of the developing limb. Conjugation of
   any combination of the three ligands did not alter the shear moduli or
   diffusion properties of the PEG hydrogels; thus, the influence of ligand
   composition on chondrogenesis could be investigated in the context of
   varying matrix stiffness. Gene expression of ligand receptors (CD44 and
   the b1-integrin) as well as markers of condensation (cell clustering and
   N-cadherin gene expression) and chondrogenesis (Col2a1 gene expression
   and sGAG production) by chondroprogenitor cells in this system were
   modulated by both matrix stiffness and ligand composition, with the
   highest gene expression occurring in softer hydrogels containing all
   three ligands. Cell proliferation in these 3D matrices for 7 d prior to
   chondrogenic induction increased the rate of sGAG production in a
   stiffness-dependent manner. This biosynthetic hydrogel supports the
   features of early limb-bud condensation and chondrogenesis and is a
   novel platform in which the influence of the matrix physicochemical
   properties on these processes can be elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{Ferulic acid decarboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyzes the
   decarboxylation of phenylacrylic acid to form styrene using a newly
   described prenylated flavin mono nucleotide cofactor. A mechanism has
   been proposed, involving an unprecedented 1,3-dipolar cyclo-addition of
   the prenylated flavin with the alpha=beta bond of the substrate that
   serves to activate the substrate toward decarboxylation. We measured a
   combination of secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) at the
   alpha- and beta-positions of phenylacrylic acid together with solvent
   deuterium KIEs. The solvent Kill is 3.3 on V-max/K-M but is close to
   unity on V-max, indicating that proton transfer to the product occurs
   before the rate-determining step. The secondary KIEs are normal at both
   the alpha- and beta-positions but vary in magnitude depending on whether
   the reaction is performed in H2O or D2O. In D2O, the enzyme catalyzed
   the exchange of deuterium into styrene; this reaction was dependent on
   the presence of bicarbonate. This observation implies that CO2 release
   must occur after protonation of the product. Further information was
   obtained from a linear free-energy analysis of the reaction through the
   use of a range of para- and meta-substituted phenylacrylic acids.
   Log(k(cat)/K-M) for the reaction correlated well with the Hammett
   sigma(-) parameter with rho = -0.39 +/- 0.03; r(2) = 0.93. The negative
   rho value and secondary isotope effects are consistent with the
   rate-determining step being the formation of styrene from the prenylated
   flavin product adduct through a cyclo-elimination reaction.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of an increase in atmospheric aerosol concentrations on the
   distribution and radiative properties of Earth's clouds is the most
   uncertain component of the overall global radiative forcing from
   preindustrial time. General circulation models (GCMs) are the tool for
   predicting future climate, but the treatment of aerosols, clouds, and
   aerosol-cloud radiative effects carries large uncertainties that
   directly affect GCM predictions, such as climate sensitivity.
   Predictions are hampered by the large range of scales of interaction
   between various components that need to be captured. Observation systems
   (remote sensing, in situ) are increasingly being used to constrain
   predictions, but significant challenges exist, to some extent because of
   the large range of scales and the fact that the various measuring
   systems tend to address different scales. Fine-scale models represent
   clouds, aerosols, and aerosol-cloud interactions with high fidelity but
   do not include interactions with the larger scale and are therefore
   limited from a climatic point of view. We suggest strategies for
   improving estimates of aerosol-cloud relationships in climate models,
   for new remote sensing and in situ measurements, and for quantifying and
   reducing model uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Solar thermophotovoltaic devices have the potential to enhance the
   performance of solar energy harvesting by converting broadband sunlight
   to narrow-band thermal radiation tuned for a photovoltaic cell. A direct
   comparison of the operation of a photovoltaic with and without a
   spectral converter is the most critical indicator of the promise of this
   technology. Here, we demonstrate enhanced device performance through the
   suppression of 80\% of unconvertible photons by pairing a
   one-dimensional photonic crystal selective emitter with a tandem
   plasma-interference optical filter. We measured a solar-to-electrical
   conversion rate of 6.8\%, exceeding the performance of the photovoltaic
   cell alone. The device operates more efficiently while reducing the heat
   generation rates in the photovoltaic cell by a factor of two at matching
   output power densities. We determined the theoretical limits, and
   discuss the implications of surpassing the Shockley-Queisser limit.
   Improving the performance of an unaltered photovoltaic cell provides an
   important framework for the design of high-efficiency solar energy
   converters.}},

   Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) against metallic Li was studied using
   direct current (DC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
   Dense polycrystalline LLZNO (rho = 97\%) and LLZTO (rho = 92\%) were
   made using solgel synthesis and rapid induction hot-pressing at 1100
   degrees C and 15.8 MPa. During DC cycling tests at room temperature (+/-
   0.01 mA/cm(2) for 36 cycles), LLZNO exhibited an increase in LiLLZNO
   interface resistance and eventually short-circuiting while the LLZTO was
   stable. After DC cycling, LLZNO appeared severely discolored while the
   LLZTO did not change in appearance. We believe the increase in LiLLZNO
   interfacial resistance and discoloration are due to reduction of Nb5+ to
   Nb4+. The negligible change in interfacial resistance and no color
   change in LLZTO suggest that Ta5+ may be more stable against reduction
   than Nb5+ in cubic garnet versus Li during cycling.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Many real networks that are collected or inferred from data are
   incomplete due to missing edges. Missing edges can be inherent to the
   dataset (Facebook friend links will never be complete) or the result of
   sampling (one may only have access to a portion of the data). The
   consequence is that downstream analyses that ``consume{''} the network
   will often yield less accurate results than if the edges were complete.
   Community detection algorithms, in particular, often suffer when
   critical intra-community edges are missing. We propose a novel consensus
   clustering algorithm to enhance community detection on incomplete
   networks. Our framework utilizes existing community detection algorithms
   that process networks imputed by our link prediction based sampling
   algorithm and merges their multiple partitions into a final consensus
   output. On average our method boosts performance of existing algorithms
   by 7\% on artificial data and 17\% on ego networks collected from
   Facebook.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a new multi-functional control system for a
   multi-port energy converter that interfaces one bi-directional battery
   port, one dc input port, and three output ports. Only one single-leg
   active switching element (a module type can be used) is employed in the
   system, and hence the single leg requires digital switching signals for
   a multi-functional operation to regulate output voltages and to
   simultaneously manage the battery port. The proposed system has
   buck-boost conversion capabilities to accommodate wide range, various
   input sources and output loads. In addition, the single leg requires no
   dead time due to an integrated impedance network, which will improve the
   system reliability and performance. Furthermore, the proposed structure
   can charge a battery even when the input and capacitor voltages are much
   lower than the battery voltage and hence it significantly improves
   charging behaviours. The proposed multi-functional control strategy and
   the converter structure are explained in detail. Then the feasibility
   and performance of the converter are verified both by computer
   simulations and experiments based on the Texas Instruments TMS320F28335
   digital signal processor.}},

Abstract = {{Intercalation and conversion are two fundamental chemical processes for
   battery materials in response to ion insertion. The interplay between
   these two chemical processes has never been directly seen and understood
   at atomic scale. Here, using in situ HRTEM, we captured the atomistic
   conversion reaction processes during Li, Na, Ca insertion into a WO3
   single crystal model electrode. An intercalation step prior to
   conversion is explicitly revealed at atomic scale for the first time for
   Li, Na, Ca. Nanoscale diffraction and ab initio molecular dynamic
   simulations revealed that after intercalation, the inserted ion-oxygen
   bond formation destabilizes the transition-metal framework which
   gradually shrinks, distorts and finally collapses to an amorphous W and
   MxO (M = Li, Na, Ca) composite structure. This study provides a full
   atomistic picture of the transition from intercalation to conversion,
   which is of essential importance for both secondary ion batteries and
   electrochromic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the devastating pandemics and outbreaks of the 20th and 21st
   centuries have involved enveloped viruses, including influenza, HIV,
   SARS, MERS, and Ebola. However, little is known about the presence and
   fate of enveloped viruses in municipal wastewater. Here, we compared the
   survival and partitioning behavior of two model enveloped viruses (MHV
   and phi 6) and two nonenveloped bacteriophages (MS2 and T3) in raw
   wastewater samples. We showed that MHV and phi 6 remained infective on
   the time scale of days: Up to 26\% of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed
   to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to 6\% of the two non
   enveloped viruses. Based on this partitioning behavior, we assessed and
   optimized methods for recovering enveloped viruses from wastewater. Our
   optimized ultrafiltration method resulted in mean recoveries (+/- SD) of

   6, respectively, and mean recoveries of 55.6\% (+/- 16.7\%) and 85.5\%

Abstract = {{Here we explore how climate warming under the Representative
   Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) impacts Arctic aerosol distributions
   via changes in atmospheric transport and removal processes. We modify
   the bulk aerosol module in the Community Atmosphere Model to track
   distributions and fluxes of 200 black carbon-like tracers emitted from
   different locations, and we conduct idealized experiments with and
   without active aerosol deposition. Changing wind patterns, studied in
   isolation, cause the Arctic burdens of tracers emitted from East Asia
   and West Europe during winter to increase about 20\% by the end of the
   century while decreasing the Arctic burdens of North American emissions
   by about 30\%. These changes are caused by an altered winter polar dome
   structure that results from Arctic amplification and inhomogeneous sea
   ice loss and surface warming, both of which are enhanced in the Chukchi
   Sea region. The resulting geostrophic wind favors Arctic transport of
   East Asian emissions while inhibiting poleward transport of North
   American emissions. When active deposition is also considered, however,
   Arctic burdens of emissions from northern midlatitudes show
   near-universal decline. This is a consequence of increased precipitation
   and wet removal, particularly within the Arctic, leading to decreased
   Arctic residence time. Simulations with present-day emissions of black
   carbon indicate a 13.6\% reduction in the Arctic annual mean burden by
   the end of the 21st century, due to warming-induced transport and
   deposition changes, while simulations with changing climate and
   emissions under RCP8.5 show a 61.0\% reduction.}},

Abstract = {{While the source of the fast solar wind is known to be coronal holes,
   the source of the slow solar wind has remained a mystery. Long time
   scale trends in the composition and charge states show strong
   correlations between solar wind velocity and plasma parameters, yet
   these correlations have proved ineffective in determining the slow wind
   source. We take advantage of new high time resolution (12 min)
   measurements of solar wind composition and charge state abundances at L1
   and previously identified 90 min quasiperiodic structures to probe the
   fundamental timescales of slow wind variability. The combination of new
   high temporal resolution composition measurements and the clearly
   identified boundaries of the periodic structures allows us to utilize
   these distinct solar wind parcels as tracers of slow wind origin and
   acceleration. We find that each 90 min (2000 Mm) parcel of slow wind has
   near-constant speed yet exhibits repeatable, systematic charge state and
   composition variations that span the entire range of statistically
   determined slow solar wind values. The classic composition-velocity
   correlations do not hold on short, approximately hourlong, time scales.
   Furthermore, the data demonstrate that these structures were created by
   magnetic reconnection. Our results impose severe new constraints on slow
   solar wind origin and provide new, compelling evidence that the slow
   wind results from the sporadic release of closed field plasma via
   magnetic reconnection at the boundary between open and closed flux in
   the Sun's atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Ethane is the second most abundant atmospheric hydrocarbon, exerts a
   strong influence on tropospheric ozone, and reduces the atmosphere's
   oxidative capacity. Global observations showed declining ethane
   abundances from 1984 to 2010, while a regional measurement indicated
   increasing levels since 2009, with the reason for this subject to
   speculation. The Bakken shale is an oil and gas-producing formation
   centered in North Dakota that experienced a rapid increase in production
   beginning in 2010. We use airborne data collected over the North Dakota
   portion of the Bakken shale in 2014 to calculate ethane emissions of
   0.23 +/- 0.07 (2s) Tg/yr, equivalent to 1-3\% of total global sources.
   Emissions of this magnitude impact air quality via concurrent increases
   in tropospheric ozone. This recently developed large ethane source from
   one location illustrates the key role of shale oil and gas production in
   rising global ethane levels.}},

Title = {{Techno-economical simulation and study of a novel MSF desalination
   process}},
Journal = {{DESALINATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{386}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Multi stage flash (MSF) desalination has proven to be the most reliable
   desalination technology for the Gulf region. As part of the continual
   quest for more sustainable and environment-friendly desalination
   technologies, this study investigates a proposed novel method for
   improving the thermodynamic and economic efficiency of MSF desalination.
   The proposed method has been tentatively named ``brine extraction{''}.
   The technique involves extracting a part of the cooling brine from the
   water boxes and re-injecting this extracted brine directly into the
   flashing chambers; i.e. the extracted brine will not pass through the
   brine heater or high-temperature flashing stages. Economically speaking,
   brine extraction is expected to reduce the surface area of condenser
   tubes at the brine heater and high temperature flashing stages, and
   shift the vapor condensation heat load to lower temperature flashing
   stages, where a cheaper condenser tube material is used. More
   importantly, brine extraction is expected to reduce both the heating
   steam and the specific electrical power consumption of the MSF process.
   A computer model of conventional MSF desalination was constructed and
   verified against the currently operational MSF plant ``Ayoun Mousa{''}
   located in Egypt After the computer model was validated, a model of a
   162 MIGD brine recirculation MSF plant was constructed and its
   performance was studied with and without the novel configuration named
   ``brine extraction{''}. Single-point brine extraction, where a single
   stream of brine is extracted, performed better than multiple-point brine
   extraction, where multiple streams are extracted at multiple points.
   Single-point brine extraction is also favored because it will cause
   minimal increase in complexity and reduction in the robustness of the
   MSF process, as only a single stream of brine will be redirected. At the
   optimum extraction ratio of 9\%, single-point extraction yielded a
   7.23\% increase in gain output ratio (GOR), a 3.47\% decrease in
   electrical consumption, and a 3.90\% decrease in total cost. Although
   the reduction in the cost of water is marginal, the reduction in
   electrical consumption and improved GOR indicate that the implementation
   of brine extraction at high top brine temperature (TBT) could be a
   promising technology in the case of solar-powered MSF, where the high
   expense of supplying thermal and electrical energy has been the most
   prohibitive factor. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Performance prediction of horizontal hydrokinetic energy converter using
   multiple-cylinder synergy in flow induced motion}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{170}},
Pages = {{92-100}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Horizontal hydrokinetic energy can be harnessed using Steady Lift
   Technology (SLT) like turbines or Alternating Lift Technology (ALT) like
   the VIVACE Converter. Tidal/current turbines with low mechanical losses
   typically achieve about 30\% peak power efficiency, which is equivalent
   to 50.6\% power efficiency over the Betz limit at flow speed nearly 3.0
   m/s. The majority of flows worldwide are slower than 1.0-1.5 m/s.
   Turbines also require large in-flow spacing resulting in farms of low
   power-to-volume density. Alternating-lift overcomes these challenges.
   The purpose of this study is to show that the ALT Converter is a
   three-dimensional energy absorber that efficiently works in river/ocean
   currents as slow as 1.0-1.5 m/s a range of velocities presently
   inaccessible to watermills and turbines. This novel converter utilizes
   flow-induced motions (FIM), which are potentially destructive phenomena
   for structures, enhances them, and converts hydrokinetic energy to
   electricity. It was invented in the Marine Renewable Energy Lab (MRELab)
   and patented through the University of Michigan. MRELab has been
   studying the effect of passive turbulence control (PTC) to enhance FIMs
   and to expand their synchronization range for energy harnessing. This
   study shows that multiple cylinders in proximity can synergistically
   work and harness more energy than the same number of a single cylinder
   in isolation. Estimation based on experiments, shows that a 4
   PTC-cylinder Converter can achieve 88.6\% peak efficiency of the Betz
   limit at flow speed slower than 1.0 m/s and power-to-volume density of
   875 W/m(3) at 1.45 m/s. Thus, the Converter can efficiently harness
   energy from rivers and ocean current as slow as 0.8-1.5 m/s, with no
   upper limit in flow velocity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   rounding into elastic flat punch solutions. Building on the concept
   developed in the first paper of using a three-quarter plane as an
   asymptote to the finite punch with rounded edge problem, we now move the
   observation point to the very edge of the contact and introduce
   asymptotes for the local contact tractions so that shear may be included
   in the analysis to solve the partial slip problem. The edge asymptotes
   are used to obtain the slip zone size and the normal and tangential
   contact traction distribution, where the rounded edge in contact can be
   reasonably approximated by a half-plane. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Expert system for automated bone age determination}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{A novel automated bone age determination algorithm using left hand X-ray
   images, which provides consistent overall bone age as well as five part
   bone ages, is presented in this paper. Based on the descriptive
   narrative from the Greulich and Pyle atlas as well as those from other
   more recent studies, 17 region of interests are selected and based on
   anatomical similarity, five clinically relevant groupings (or
   ``parts{''}) are defined on left hand X-ray images. When disharmonious
   maturations for different regions of interest are large, providing part
   bone ages with overall bone age is helpful to pediatricians. Based on
   interviews with two experts to get input on their bone age determination
   strategy, overall bone age determination can be viewed as the weighted
   sum of ``part bone ages{''} of the five parts. Using the method of least
   squares and inputs from five (human) readers, we extract weights for
   bone age determination using all five parts (as well as reduced
   algorithms using only four, three or two parts). The weights indicate
   that part 1 (distal joints) has the highest priority. Overall bone age
   is then estimated based on the weights and bone ages of available parts.
   In our work, a computer vision algorithm provides bone ages of
   individual regions of interest. To combine the region of interest
   computer classifiers and generate each of the five part bone ages, we
   develop and analyze fusion rules of multiple classifiers with more than
   three classes each. The fusion rules take into account performance of
   each region of interest classifier. Once the part bone ages are obtained
   based on the fusion rule and region of interest classifiers, the overall
   bone age is determined in a fully automated way. Finally, we give a use
   case for the whole automated bone age determination system and
   validation of the algorithm based on given performance of each region of
   interest computer classifier. Results indicate that the algorithm works
   well with reasonably good classifiers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The thermal, structural and magnetic properties were studied for the
   hexagonal MnCo0.78Fe0.22Ge alloys, which undergoes a first-order phase
   transformation from paramagnetic hexagonal phase into ferromagnetic
   orthorhombic martensite on cooling. Owing to the magnetostructural
   coupling, large magnetocaloric effect (Delta S-M= 10.97 J kg(-1) K-1)
   was obtained at 254 K. In-situ synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction
   experiments were conducted to reveal the detailed change in
   crystallographic structure of phases and the effect of applied magnetic
   field on phase transformation behaviors. An anomalously huge strain of
   11.89\% and volume expansion of 4.35\% in unit-cell were obtained
   between martensite and parent phase across the transformation.
   Furthermore, the magnetic field-induced martensitic transformation was
   directly evidenced at 250 K, which eventually demonstrates the
   possibility to achieve magnetic-field-induced strain and large

Title = {{Optimization of chiral lattice based metastructures for broadband
   vibration suppression using genetic algorithms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{369}},
Pages = {{50-62}},
Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in civil, mechanical, and aerospace
   engineering is to develop vibration suppression systems with high
   efficiency and low cost. Recent studies have shown that high damping
   performance at broadband frequencies can be achieved by incorporating
   periodic inserts with tunable dynamic properties as internal resonators
   in structural systems. Structures featuring these kinds of inserts are
   referred to as meta materials inspired structures or metastructures.
   Chiral lattice inserts exhibit unique characteristics such as frequency
   bandgaps which can be tuned by varying the parameters that define the
   lattice topology. Recent analytical and experimental investigations have
   shown that broadband vibration attenuation can be achieved by including
   chiral lattices as internal resonators in beam-like structures. However,
   these studies have suggested that the performance of chiral lattice
   inserts can be maximized by utilizing an efficient optimization
   technique to obtain the optimal topology of the inserted lattice. In
   this study, an automated optimization procedure based on a genetic
   algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal set of parameters that will
   result in chiral lattice inserts tuned properly to reduce the global
   vibration levels of a finite-sized beam. Genetic algorithms are
   considered in this study due to their capability of dealing with complex
   and insufficiently understood optimization problems. In the optimization
   process, the basic parameters that govern the geometry of periodic
   chiral lattices including the number of circular nodes, the thickness of
   the ligaments, and the characteristic angle are considered.
   Additionally, a new set of parameters is introduced to enable the
   optimization process to explore non-periodic chiral designs. Numerical
   simulations are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the
   optimization process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The critical role of angiogenesis for solid tumor growth and metastatic
   spread has been well established. In contrast, even though increased
   vascularity has been commonly observed in bone marrows of patients with
   hematological malignancies (liquid tumors), the pathophysiology of
   leukemia-induced angiogenesis in the bone marrow remains elusive. This
   paper demonstrates the usage of a microengineered 3D biomimetic model to
   study leukemic-cell-induced bone marrow angiogenesis. Rational design of
   the 3D angiogenesis chip incorporating endothelial cells (ECs), leukemic
   cells, and bone marrow stromal fibroblasts provide an efficient
   biomimetic means to promote and visualize early angiogenic processes.
   Morphological features of angiogenesis induced by three different
   leukemic cell lines (U937, HL60, and K562) are investigated and
   compared. Quantitative measurements of angiogenic factors secreted from
   monocultures and cocultures of leukemic cells with bone marrow stromal
   fibroblasts suggest a synergistic relationship between ECs, leukemic
   cells, and bone marrow stromal fibroblasts for angiogenic induction, and
   also confirm the necessity of conducting functional angiogenic assays in
   proper 3D biomimetic cell culture systems like the one developed in this
   work.}},

Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{The use of atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) in plasma medicine
   have produced encouraging results in wound treatment, surface
   sterilization, deactivation of bacteria, and treatment of cancer cells.
   It is known that many of the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
   produced by the APPJ are critical to these processes. Other key
   components to treatment include the ion and photon fluxes, and the
   electric fields produced in cells by the ionization wave of the APPJ
   striking in the vicinity of the cells. These relationships are often
   complicated by the cells being covered by a thin liquid layer-wet cells.
   In this paper, results from a computational investigation of the
   interaction of APPJs with tissue beneath a liquid layer are discussed.
   The emphasis of this study is the delivery of electric fields by an APPJ
   sustained in He/O-2 = 99.8/0.2 flowing into humid air to cells lying
   beneath water with thickness of 200 mu m. The water layer represents the
   biological fluid typically covering tissue during treatment. Three
   voltages were analyzed-two that produce a plasma effluent that touches
   the surface of the water layer and one that does not touch. The effect
   of the liquid layer thickness, 50 mu m to 1 mm, was also examined.
   Comparisons were made of the predicted intracellular electric fields to
   those thresholds used in the field of bioelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{New light harvesting organic conjugated polymers containing
   4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo{[}1,2-b;3,4-b']-dithiophene(BDT) donor
   groups and thiophene with various electron-withdrawing acceptor groups
   were investigated. Also investigated was
   poly{[}{[}4,8-bis{[}(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo
   {[}1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl]{[}3-fluoro-2-{[}(2-ethylhexyl)carb
   onyl]thieno{[}3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7), which is one of the most
   efficient photovoltaic conjugated polymers. In this study, the steady
   state absorption, steady state emission, ultrafast fluorescent decay
   dynamics, and nonlinear optical properties of these light harvesting
   conjugated polymers were probed in solution. All of the conjugated
   polymers investigated have significant absorption over much of the
   visible spectrum due to small band gaps due to low lying LUMO energies
   created by the electron withdrawing groups. Fluorescence upconversion
   studies on the conjugated polymers showed short decay dynamics for
   conjugated polymers with strong electron-withdrawing groups. Two-photon
   absorption spectroscopy showed large two-photon absorption cross
   sections for the conjugated polymers with strong electron-withdrawing
   acceptors. Fluorescence anisotropy decay studies showed contributions
   from both hopping and a coherent energy migration process for some of
   the polymers. The polymers were investigated for their photovoltaic
   efficiency and correlated with both the steady-state and time-resolved
   dynamics of the investigated donor acceptor polymers.}},

   molecular imaging agent design}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{Molecular imaging agent design involves simultaneously optimizing
   multiple probe properties. While several desired characteristics are
   straightforward, including high affinity and low non-specific background
   signal, in practice there are quantitative trade-offs between these
   properties. These include plasma clearance, where fast clearance lowers
   background signal but can reduce target uptake, and binding, where high
   affinity compounds sometimes suffer from lower stability or increased
   non-specific interactions. Further complicating probe development, many
   of the optimal parameters vary depending on both target tissue and
   imaging agent properties, making empirical approaches or previous
   experience difficult to translate. Here, we focus on low molecular
   weight compounds targeting extracellular receptors, which have some of
   the highest contrast values for imaging agents. We use a mechanistic
   approach to provide a quantitative framework for weighing trade-offs
   between molecules. Our results show that specific target uptake is
   well-described by quantitative simulations for a variety of targeting
   agents, whereas non-specific background signal is more difficult to
   predict. Two in vitro experimental methods for estimating background
   signal in vivo are compared - non-specific cellular uptake and plasma
   protein binding. Together, these data provide a quantitative method to
   guide probe design and focus animal work for more cost-effective and
   time-efficient development of molecular imaging agents.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Governments encourage use of electric vehicles (EV) via regulation and
   investment to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Manufacturers
   produce vehicles to maximize profit, given available public
   infrastructure and government incentives. EV public adoption depends not
   only on price and vehicle attributes, but also on EV market size and
   infrastructure available for refueling, such as charging station
   proximity and recharging length and cost. Earlier studies have shown
   that government investment can create EV market growth, and that
   manufacturers and charging station operators must cooperate to achieve
   overall profitability. This article describes a framework that connects
   decisions by the three stakeholders (government, EV manufacturer,
   charging station operator) with preferences of the driving public. The
   goal is to develop a framework that allows the effect of government
   investment on the EV market to be quantified. This is illustrated in
   three scenarios in which we compare optimal public investment for a city
   in USA (Ann Arbor, Michigan) and one in China (Beijing) to minimize
   emissions, accounting for customer preferences elicited from surveys
   conducted in the two countries. Under the modeling assumptions of the
   framework, we find that high customer sensitivity to prices, combined
   with manufacturer and charging station operator profit maximization
   strategies, can render government investment in EV subsidies
   ineffective, while a collaboration among stakeholders can achieve both
   emission reduction and profitability. When EV and station designs
   improve beyond a certain threshold, government investment influence on
   EV adoption is attenuated apparently due to diminishing customer
   willingness to buy. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that a
   diversified government investment portfolio could be especially
   effective for the Chinese market, with charging costs and price cuts on
   license plate fees being as important as EV subsidies.}},

Title = {{Contemporary Management Strategies for Chronic Type B Aortic
   Dissections: A Systematic Review}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Currently, the optimal management strategy for chronic type B aortic
   dissections (CBAD) is unknown. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the
   literature to compare results of open surgical repair (OSR), standard
   thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) or branched and fenestrated
   TEVAR (BEVAR/FEVAR) for CBAD.
   Methods
   EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched for eligible studies between
   January 2000 and October 2015. Studies describing outcomes of OSR,
   TEVAR, B/FEVAR, or all, for CBAD patients initially treated with medical
   therapy, were included. Primary endpoints were early mortality, and
   one-year and five-year survival. Secondary endpoints included occurrence
   of complications. Furthermore, a Time until Treatment Equipoise (TUTE)
   graph was constructed.
   Results
   Thirty-five articles were selected for systematic review. A total of
   1081 OSR patients, 1397 TEVAR patients and 61 B/FEVAR patients were
   identified. Early mortality ranged from 5.6\% to 21.0\% for OSR, 0.0\%
   to 13.7\% for TEVAR, and 0.0\% to 9.7\% for B/FEVAR. For OSR, one-year
   and five-year survival ranged 72.0\%-92.0\% and 53.0\%-86.7\%,
   respectively. For TEVAR, one-year survival was 82.9\%-100.0\% and
   five-year survival 70.0\%-88.9\%. For B/FEVAR only one-year survival was
   available, ranging between 76.4\% and 100.0\%. Most common postoperative
   complications included stroke (OSR 0.0\%-13.3\%, TEVAR 0.0\%-11.8\%),
   spinal cord ischemia (OSR 0.0\%-16.4\%, TEVAR 0.0\%-12.5\%, B/FEVAR
   0.0\%-12.9\%) and acute renal failure (OSR 0.0\%-33.3\%, TEVAR
   0.0\%-34.4\%, B/FEVAR 0.0\%-3.2\%). Most common long-term complications
   after OSR included aneurysm formation (5.8\%-20.0\%) and new type A
   dissection (1.7-2.2\%). Early complications after TEVAR included
   retrograde dissection (0.0\%-7.1\%), malperfusion (1.3\%-9.4\%), cardiac
   complications (0.0\%-5.9\%) and rupture (0.5\%-5.0\%). Most common
   long-term complications after TEVAR were rupture (0.5\%-7.1\%),
   endoleaks (0.0\%-15.8\%) and cardiac complications (5.9\%-7.1\%). No
   short-term aortic rupture or malperfusion was observed after B/FEVAR.
   Long-term complications included malperfusion (6.5\%) and endoleaks
   (0.0\%-66.7\%). Reintervention rates after OSR, TEVAR and B/FEVAR were
   5.8\%-29.0\%, 4.3\%-47.4\% and 0.0\%-53.3\%, respectively. TUTE for OSR
   was 2.7 years, for TEVAR 9.9 months and for B/FEVAR 10.3 months.
   Conclusion
   We found a limited early survival benefit of standard TEVAR over OSR for
   CBAD. Complication rates after TEVAR are higher, but complications after
   OSR are usually more serious. Initial experiences with B/FEVAR show its
   feasibility, but long-term results are needed to compare it to OSR and
   standard TEVAR. We conclude that optimal treatment of CBAD remains
   debatable and merits a patient specific decision. TUTE seems a feasible
   and useful tool to better understand management outcomes of CBAD.}},

Abstract = {{Deep phenotyping of single cancer cells is of critical importance in the
   era of precision medicine to advance understanding of relationships
   between gene mutation and cell phenotype and to elucidate the biological
   nature of tumor heterogeneity. Existing microfluidic single-cell
   phenotyping tools, however, are limited to phenotypic measurements of
   1-2 selected morphological and physiological features of single cells.
   Herein a microfluidic elasticity microcytometer is reported for
   multiparametric biomechanical and biochemical phenotypic profiling of
   free-floating, live single cancer cells for quantitative, simultaneous
   characterizations of cell size, cell deformability/stiffness, and
   surface receptors. The elasticity microcytometer is implemented for
   measurements and comparisons of four human cell lines with distinct
   metastatic potentials and derived from different human tissues. An
   analytical model is developed from first principles for the first time
   to convert cell deformation and adhesion information of single cancer
   cells encapsulated inside the elasticity microcytometer to cell
   deformability/stiffness and surface protein expression. Together, the
   elasticity microcytometer holds great promise for comprehensive
   molecular, cellular, and biomechanical phenotypic profiling of live
   cancer cells at the single cell level, critical for studying intratumor
   cellular and molecular heterogeneity using low-abundance, clinically

Abstract = {{Specific immunotherapy (SIT) is the most widely used treatment for
   allergic diseases that directly targets the T helper 2 (Th2) bias
   underlying allergy. However, the most widespread clinical applications
   of SIT require a long period of dose escalation with soluble antigen
   (Ag) and carry a significant risk of adverse reactions, particularly in
   highly sensitized patients who stand to benefit most from a curative
   treatment. Thus, the development of safer, more efficient methods to
   induce Ag-specific immune tolerance is critical to advancing allergy
   treatment. We hypothesized that antigen-associated nanoparticles
   (Ag-NPs), which we have used to prevent and treat Th1/Th17-mediated
   autoimmune disease, would also be effective for the induction of
   tolerance in a murine model of Th2-mediated ovalbumin/alum-induced
   allergic airway inflammation. We demonstrate here that
   antigen-conjugated polystyrene (Ag-PS) NPs, although effective for the
   prophylactic induction of tolerance, induce anaphylaxis in presensitized
   mice. Antigen-conjugated NPs made of biodegradable
   poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (Ag-PLG) are similarly effective
   prophylactically, are well tolerated by sensitized animals, but only
   partially inhibit Th2 responses when administered therapeutically. PLG
   NPs containing encapsulated antigen {[}PLG(Ag)], however, were well
   tolerated and effectively inhibited Th2 responses and airway
   inflammation both prophylactically and therapeutically. Thus, we
   illustrate progression toward PLG(Ag) as a biodegradable Ag carrier
   platform for the safe and effective inhibition of allergic airway
   inflammation without the need for nonspecific immunosuppression in
   animals with established Th2 sensitization.}},

Abstract = {{As manufacturers face fierce competition in the global market,
   responsiveness has become an important competitiveness factor in
   addition to quality and cost. One essential responsiveness strategy is
   to reduce product development and lead times by integrating assembly
   planning with supplier assignment. This paper addresses the problem of
   integrated assembly and supply chain design under lead-time constraints
   by formulating and solving an optimisation problem with minimal total
   supply chain costs. This new time-constrained joint optimisation problem
   belongs to an NP-hard resource-constrained scheduling problem. To model
   this problem effectively, we develop a novel Hyper AND/OR graph and
   apply it for integrating assembly and supply chain decisions. We also
   develop a dynamic programming model and associated algorithm in order to
   solve the integrated optimisation problem with pseudo-polynomial time
   complexity in practice. Numerical case studies validate that the methods
   developed can solve the integrated decision-making problem optimally and
   efficiently. This paper overcomes the limitations of previous studies on
   concurrent assembly decomposition and supplier selection, which
   optimises cost without time constraints. The models and results of this
   research can be applied to a variety of areas including assembly design,
   maintenance module planning and supply chain restructuring.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of coupled T-shaped structural walls was studied through
   tests of two large-scale four-story specimens under reversed cyclic
   lateral displacements. The use of tensile strain-hardening,
   high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (HPFRC) in coupling beams and
   walls was evaluated as a means to reduce diagonal and confinement
   reinforcement. The Specimen CW-1 walls were constructed with reinforced
   concrete (RC) designed to satisfy ACI Building Code (ACI 318-08) seismic
   provisions. The walls in Specimen CW-2 were constructed with HPFRC and
   reduced shear and confinement reinforcement. Each specimen included one
   RC and three HPFRC precast coupling beams with span-depth ratios of
   1.75. Both specimens sustained 80\% of the peak lateral strength through
   loading cycles to at least 2.5\% drift. Inelastic flexural deformations
   were more concentrated near the foundation in the HPFRC walls than in
   the RC walls, which led to a higher curvature demand at the base of the
   HPFRC walls. Although the walls in both specimens exhibited a
   flexural-dominated behavior, shear distortions in the first story of the
   walls reached 0.01 rad. Detailed data are presented regarding specimen
   behavior, including wall and coupling beam deformations.}},

Abstract = {{Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) coolers are commonly used in diesel and
   modern gasoline engines to reduce the re-circulated gas temperature. A
   common problem with the EGR cooler is a reduction of the effectiveness
   due to the fouling layer primarily caused by thermophoresis, diffusion,
   and hydrocarbon condensation. Typically, effectiveness decreases rapidly
   at first, and asymptotically stabilizes over time. There are several
   hypotheses of this stabilizing phenomenon; one of the possible theories
   is a deposit removal mechanism. Verifying such a mechanism and finding
   out the correlation between the removal and stabilization tendency would
   be a key factor to understand and overcome the problem. Some authors
   have proposed that the removal is a possible influential factor, while
   other authors suggest that removal is not a significant factor under
   realistic conditions. This study identifies the effect of the deposit
   surface temperature on the removal mechanism with gas velocity and layer
   thickness variables and concludes that removal does occur under
   realistic conditions. To investigate the relation, the surface
   temperature is controlled by setting isothermal conditions of both
   blowing air and coolant, and the deposit build time is varied to find
   deposit thickness effects on removal. The blown-out particles are
   filtered out for mass weighing and size analysis. Additionally, a
   statistical analysis is conducted and an empirical removal equation is
   extracted to verify the removal mechanism through modeling. The results
   show that the removal mechanism has considerable correlation with
   deposit surface temperature as well as wall shear stress and deposit
   thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers are used on diesel engines to
   reduce peak in-cylinder flame temperatures, leading to less NOx
   formation during the combustion process. There is an ongoing concern
   with soot and hydrocarbon fouling inside the cold surface of the cooler.
   The fouling layer reduces the heat transfer efficiency and causes
   pressure drop to increase across the cooler. A number of experimental
   studies have demonstrated that the fouling layer tends to asymptotically
   approach a critical height, after which the layer growth ceases. One
   potential explanation for this behavior is the removal mechanism derived
   by the shear force applied on the soot and hydrocarbon deposit surface.
   As the deposit layer thickens, shear force applied on the fouling
   surface increases due to the flow velocity growth. When a critical shear
   force is applied, deposit particles start to get removed. In this study,
   a 1-D model is developed to predict effectiveness drop and fouling layer
   distribution across the cooler. To model the removal mechanism,
   experiments described in Part 1 of this paper were conducted. Removal of
   particles was measured by blowing compressed air in various conditions
   through the fouled tube from the shell-in-tube type EGR cooler rig. A
   deposit removal regression equation was developed using the blow out
   experiment data, which was incorporated into the model. The resulting
   model showed good correspondence with the experimental data, indicating
   that removal mechanism improves the prediction of modeling. For the
   first time, the new model with the empirically derived removal function
   is able to predict the trend of thermal effectiveness stabilization
   observed in experiments.}},

   its corrosion resistance increased with the aging time. The purity of
   the copper matrix increased with precipitation and precipitates
   coarsening, resulting in the corrosion resistance increasing. Impedance
   spectra and equivalent circuit analysis confirmed that a multi-layer
   protective film formed on sample surface. Typical uniform corrosion
   appeared in this alloy, and the film density increased with the days of
   immersion and the aging treatment time. X-ray photoelectron spectra
   results showed that the main corrosion products were CuO, Cu2O, Al2O3,
   and Al(OH)(3).}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: High mortality and resource use burden are associated with
   hospitalization of critically ill children transferred from level II
   pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) to level I PICUs for escalated
   care. Guidelines urge transfer of the most severely ill children to
   level I PICUs without specification of either the criteria or the best
   timing of transfer to achieve good outcomes.
   Objectives: To identify factors associated with transfer, develop a
   modeling framework that uses those factors to determine thresholds to
   guide transfer decisions, and test these thresholds against actual
   patient transfer data to determine if delay in transfer could be
   reduced.
   Methods: A multistep approach was adopted, with initial identification
   of factors associated with transfer status using data from a prior
   case-control study conducted with children with respiratory failure
   admitted to six level II PICUs between January 1, 1997, and December 31,
   2007. To identify when to transfer a patient, thresholds for transfer
   were created using generalized estimating equations and discrete event
   simulation. The transfer policies were then tested against actual
   transfer data.
   Measurements and Main Results: Multivariate logistic regression revealed
   that the absolute difference of a patient's pediatric logistic organ
   dysfunction score from the admission value, high-frequency oscillatory
   ventilation use, antibiotic use, and blood transfusions were all
   significantly associated with transfer status. The resulting threshold
   policies led to average transfer delay reduction ranging from 0.5 to 2.3
   days in the testing dataset.
   Conclusions: Current transfer guidelines are devoid of criteria to
   identify critically ill children who might benefit from transfer and
   when the best time to transfer might be. In this study, we used
   innovative methods to create thresholds of transfer that might reduce
   delay in transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of
   the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite programming (SDP)
   relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist
   practical problems for which the SDP relaxation fails to yield the
   global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the SDP
   relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is
   appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions,
   which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is
   that failure of the SDP relaxation can be related to physical
   characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with
   two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically
   based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The SDP
   relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global
   solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent
   the same system, success (or otherwise) of the SDP relaxation must
   involve factors beyond just the network physics. The lack of universal
   physical conditions for success of the SDP relaxation motivates the
   development of tighter convex relaxations capable of solving a broader
   class of problems. Tools from polynomial optimization theory provide a
   means of developing tighter relaxations. This paper uses the example
   problem to illustrate relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for
   polynomial optimization and a related ``mixed semidefinite/second-order
   cone programming{''} hierarchy.}},

Abstract = {{The neutral and plasma environment is critical in understanding the
   interaction of the solar wind and comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG),
   the target of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission. To serve this
   need and support the Rosetta mission, we have developed a 3-D four-fluid
   model, which is based on BATS-R-US (Block-Adaptive Tree Solarwind
   Roe-type Upwind Scheme) within SWMF (Space Weather Modeling Framework)
   that solves the governing multifluid MHD equations and the Euler
   equations for the neutral gas fluid. These equations describe the
   behavior and interactions of the cometary heavy ions, the solar wind
   protons, the electrons, and the neutrals. This model incorporates
   different mass loading processes, including photoionization and electron
   impact ionization, charge exchange, dissociative ion-electron
   recombination, and collisional interactions between different fluids. We
   simulated the plasma and neutral gas environment near perihelion in
   three different cases: an idealized comet with a spherical body and
   uniform neutral gas outflow, an idealized comet with a spherical body
   and illumination-driven neutral gas outflow, and comet CG with a
   realistic shape model and illumination-driven neutral gas outflow. We
   compared the results of the three cases and showed that the simulations
   with illumination-driven neutral gas outflow have magnetic reconnection,
   a magnetic pileup region and nucleus directed plasma flow inside the
   nightside reconnection region, which have not been reported in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Using the database of CRRES in situ observations of the plasmapause
   crossings, we develop linear and more complex plasmapause models
   parametrized by (a) solar wind parameters V (solar wind velocity), BV
   (where B is the magnitude of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)),
   and d(mp)/dt (which combines different physical mechanisms which run
   magnetospheric activity), and (b) geomagnetic indices Dst, Ap, and AE.
   The complex models are built by including a first harmonic in magnetic
   local time (MLT). Our method based on the cross-correlation analyses
   provides not only the plasmapause shape for different levels of
   geomagnetic activity but additionally yields the information of the
   delays in the MLT response of the plasmapause. All models based on both
   solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indices indicate the maximal
   plasmapause extension in the postdusk side at high geomagnetic activity.
   The decrease in the convection electric field places the bulge toward
   midnight. These results are compared and discussed in regard to past
   works. Our study shows that the time delays in the plasmapause response
   are a function of MLT and suggests that the plasmapause is formed by the
   mechanism of interchange instability motion. We observed that any change
   quickly propagates across dawn to noon, and then at lower rate toward
   midnight. The results further indicate that the instability may
   propagate much faster during solar maximum than around solar minimum.
   This study contributes to the determination of the MLT dependence of the
   plasmapause and to constrain physical mechanism by which the plasmapause
   is formed.}},

Abstract = {{The quasi-DC compressions of the Earth's dayside magnetic field by
   ram-pressure fluctuations in the solar wind are characterized by using
   multiple GOES spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit, multiple Los Alamos
   spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit, global MHD simulations, and ACE and
   Wind solar wind measurements. Owing to the inward-outward advection of
   plasma as the dayside magnetic field is compressed, magnetic field
   compressions experienced by the plasma in the dayside magnetosphere are
   greater than the magnetic field compressions measured by a spacecraft.
   Theoretical calculations indicate that the plasma compression can be a
   factor of 2 higher than the observed magnetic field compression. The
   solar wind ram-pressure changes causing the quasi-DC magnetospheric
   compressions are mostly owed to rapid changes in the solar wind number
   density associated with the crossing of plasma boundaries; an Earth
   crossing of a plasma boundary produces a sudden change in the dayside
   magnetic field strength accompanied by a sudden inward or outward motion
   of the plasma in the dayside magnetosphere. Superposed epoch analysis of
   high-speed-stream-driven storms was used to explore solar wind
   compressions and storm time geosynchronous magnetic field compressions,
   which are of particular interest for the possible contribution to the
   energization of the outer electron radiation belt. The occurrence
   distributions of dayside magnetic field compressions, solar wind
   ram-pressure changes, and dayside radial plasma flow velocities were
   investigated: all three quantities approximately obey power law
   statistics for large values. The approximate power law indices for the
   distributions of magnetic compressions and ram-pressure changes were
   both -3.}},

Abstract = {{We use our fully coupled 3-D Jupiter Thermosphere General Circulation
   Model (JTGCM) to quantify processes which are responsible for generating
   neutral winds in Jupiter's oval thermosphere from 20 mu bar to
   10(-4)nbar self-consistently with the thermal structure and composition.
   The heat sources in the JTGCM that drive the global circulation of
   neutral flow are substantial Joule heating produced in the Jovian ovals
   by imposing high-speed anticorotational ion drifts (similar to
   3.5kms(-1)) and charged particle heating from auroral processes
   responsible for bright oval emissions. We find that the zonal flow of
   neutral winds in the auroral ovals of both hemispheres is primarily
   driven by competition between accelerations resulting from Coriolis
   forcing and ion drag processes near the ionospheric peak. However, above
   the ionospheric peak (<0.01 mu bar), the acceleration of neutral flow
   due to pressure gradients is found to be the most effective parameter
   impacting zonal winds, competing mainly with acceleration due to
   advection with minor contributions from curvature and Coriolis forces in
   the southern oval, while in the northern oval it competes alone with
   considerable Coriolis forcing. The meridional flow of neutral winds in
   both ovals in the JTGCM is determined by competition between meridional
   accelerations due to Coriolis forcing and pressure gradients. We find
   that meridional flow in the lower thermosphere, near the peak of the
   auroral ionosphere, is poleward, with peak wind speeds of similar to
   0.6kms(-1) and similar to 0.1kms(-1) in the southern and northern oval,
   respectively. The corresponding subsiding flow of neutral motion is
   similar to 5ms(-1) in the southern oval, while this flow is rising in
   the northern oval with reduced speed of similar to 2ms(-1). We also find
   that the strength of meridional flow in both auroral ovals is gradually
   weakened and turned equatorward near 0.08 mu bar with wind speeds up to
   similar to 250ms(-1) (southern oval) and similar to 75ms(-1) (northern
   oval). The corresponding neutral motion in this region is upward, with
   wind speeds up to 4ms(-1) in both ovals.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of comets for the origin of life on Earth has been
   advocated for many decades. Amino acids are key ingredients in
   chemistry, leading to life as we know it. Many primitive meteorites
   contain amino acids, and it is generally believed that these are formed
   by aqueous alterations. In the collector aerogel and foil samples of the
   Stardust mission after the flyby at comet Wild 2, the simplest form of
   amino acids, glycine, has been found together with precursor molecules
   methylamine and ethylamine. Because of contamination issues of the
   samples, a cometary origin was deduced from the C-13 isotopic signature.
   We report the presence of volatile glycine accompanied by methylamine
   and ethylamine in the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko measured by the
   ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) mass
   spectrometer, confirming the Stardust results. Together with the
   detection of phosphorus and a multitude of organic molecules, this
   result demonstrates that comets could have played a crucial role in the
   emergence of life on Earth.}},

Abstract = {{Decision makers and consultants are particularly interested in detailed
   information on future climate to prepare adaptation strategies and
   adjust design criteria. Projections of future climate at local spatial
   scales and fine temporal resolutions are subject to the same
   uncertainties as those at the global scale but the partition among
   uncertainty sources (emission scenarios, climate models, and internal
   climate variability) remains largely unquantified. At the local scale,
   the uncertainty of the mean and extremes of precipitation is shown to be
   irreducible for mid and end-of-century projections because it is almost
   entirely caused by internal climate variability (stochasticity).
   Conversely, projected changes in mean air temperature and other
   meteorological variables can be largely constrained, even at local
   scales, if more accurate emission scenarios can be developed. The
   results were obtained by applying a comprehensive stochastic downscaling
   technique to climate model outputs for three exemplary locations. In
   contrast with earlier studies, the three sources of uncertainty are
   considered as dependent and, therefore, non-additive. The evidence of
   the predominant role of internal climate variability leaves little room
   for uncertainty reduction in precipitation projections; however, the
   inference is not necessarily negative, because the uncertainty of
   historic observations is almost as large as that for future projections
   with direct implications for climate change adaptation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Between January 2013 and December 2014, water levels on Lake Superior
   and Lake Michigan-Huron, the two largest lakes on Earth by surface area,
   rose at the highest rate ever recorded for a 2 year period beginning in
   January and ending in December of the following year. This historic
   event coincided with below-average air temperatures and extensive winter
   ice cover across the Great Lakes. It also brought an end to a 15 year
   period of persistently below-average water levels on Lakes Superior and
   Michigan-Huron that included several months of record-low water levels.
   To differentiate hydrological drivers behind the recent water level
   rise, we developed a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine
   for inferring historical estimates of the major components of each
   lake's water budget. Our results indicate that, in 2013, the water level
   rise on Lake Superior was driven by increased spring runoff and
   over-lake precipitation. In 2014, reduced over-lake evaporation played a
   more significant role in Lake Superior's water level rise. The water
   level rise on Lake Michigan-Huron in 2013 was also due to above-average
   spring runoff and persistent over-lake precipitation, while in 2014, it
   was due to a rare combination of below-average evaporation,
   above-average runoff and precipitation, and very high inflow rates from
   Lake Superior through the St. Marys River. We expect, in future
   research, to apply our new framework across the other Laurentian Great
   Lakes, and to Earth's other large freshwater basins as well.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, small perturbation method (SPM) and Kirchhoff
   approximation (KA) are incorporated into ray-tracing (RT) routines to
   model multiuser multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) channels formed on a
   rough dielectric terrain. The effect of surface roughness and
   correlation length, solid soil fractions, moisture content, link range,
   antenna height, polarization, radiation pattern, and carrier frequency
   are examined on received power, power delay and angular profiles, root
   mean square (RMS) delay and angular spread, coherence bandwidth, and
   coherence distance. Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that
   antenna directionality and terrain undulation and textural composition
   have significant impacts on the received signal power and channel
   multipath parameters and, hence, the performance of MU-MIMO
   terrain-based communication systems.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical loading and release of endogenous parathyroid hormone (PTH)
   during exercise facilitate the adaptation of bone. However, it remains
   unclear how exercise and PTH influence the composition of bone and how
   exercise and PTH-mediated compositional changes influence the mechanical
   properties of bone. Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to
   establish compositional changes within osteocytes' perilacunar region of
   cortical bone following exercise, and evaluate the influence of
   endogenous PTH signaling on this perilacunar adaptation. Raman
   spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to evaluate tissue composition
   surrounding individual lacuna within the tibia of 19 week old male mice
   exposed to treadmill running for 3 weeks. As a result of exercise,
   tissue within the perilacunar region (within 0-5 pm of the lacuna wall)
   had a lower mineral-to-matrix ratio (MMR) compared to sedentary
   controls. In addition, exercise also increased the
   carbonate-to-phosphate ratio (CPR) across both perilacunar and
   non-perilacunar regions (5-10 pm and 10-15 pm from the lacuna walls).
   Tibial post-yield work had a significant negative correlation with
   perilacunar MMR. Inhibition of PTH activity with PTH(7-34) demonstrated
   that perilacunar remodeling during exercise was dependent on the
   cellular response to endogenous PTH. The osteocytes' response to
   endogenous PTH during exercise was characterized by a significant
   reduction in SOST expression and significant increase in FGF-23
   expression. The potential reduction in phosphate levels due to FGF-23
   expression may explain the increase in carbonate substitution. Overall,
   this is the first study to demonstrate that adaptation in tissue
   composition is localized around individual osteocytes, may contribute to
   the changes in whole bone mechanics during exercise, and that PTH
   signaling during exercise contributes to these adaptations. (C) 2016

   rigid-body motion accumulating during each cycle). Shakedown theorems
   can be established for systems in which the normal and tangential

   depends on the initial conditions. In such cases the system memory'

   networked bargaining game. We assume a complete information setup
   wherein all the agents know the structure of the network, the values of
   the consumers, and the transaction costs involved but allow for some
   search friction when either producers or consumers trade with middlemen.
   In such a setting, we show that sunk cost problems and a heterogeneous
   network can give rise to delay or failure in negotiation, and therefore
   reduce the total trade capacity of the network. In the limiting regime
   of extremely patient agents, we provide a sharp characterization of the

Abstract = {{Granulomas are a hallmark of tuberculosis. Inside granulomas, the
   pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis may enter a metabolically inactive
   state that is less susceptible to antibiotics. Understanding M.
   tuberculosis metabolism within granulomas could contribute to reducing
   the lengthy treatment required for tuberculosis and provide additional
   targets for new drugs. Two key adaptations of M. tuberculosis are a
   nonreplicating phenotype and accumulation of lipid inclusions in
   response to hypoxic conditions. To explore how these adaptations
   influence granuloma-scale outcomes in vivo, we present a multiscale in
   silico model of granuloma formation in tuberculosis. The model comprises
   host immunity, M. tuberculosis metabolism, M. tuberculosis growth
   adaptation to hypoxia, and nutrient diffusion. We calibrated our model
   to in vivo data from nonhuman primates and rabbits and apply the model
   to predict M. tuberculosis population dynamics and heterogeneity within
   granulomas. We found that bacterial populations are highly dynamic
   throughout infection in response to changing oxygen levels and host
   immunity pressures. Our results indicate that a nonreplicating
   phenotype, but not lipid inclusion formation, is important for long-term
   M. tuberculosis survival in granulomas. We used virtual M. tuberculosis
   knockouts to predict the impact of both metabolic enzyme inhibitors and
   metabolic pathways exploited to overcome inhibition. Results indicate
   that knockouts whose growth rates are below similar to 66\% of the
   wild-type growth rate in a culture medium featuring lipid as the only
   carbon source are unable to sustain infections in granulomas. By mapping
   metabolite-and gene-scale perturbations to granuloma-scale outcomes and
   predicting mechanisms of sterilization, our method provides a powerful
   tool for hypothesis testing and guiding experimental searches for novel
   antituberculosis interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) exhibit a small
   population of uniquely tumorigenic cancer stem cells (CSC) endowed with
   self-renewal and multipotency. We have recently shown that IL-6 enhances
   the survival and tumorigenic potential of head and neck cancer stem
   cells (i.e. ALDH(high)CD44(high) cells). Here, we characterized the
   effect of therapeutic inhibition of IL-6 with a novel humanized
   anti-IL-6 antibody (MEDI5117) using three low-passage patient-derived
   xenograft (PDX) models of HNSCC. We observed that single agent MEDI5117
   inhibited the growth of PDX-SCC-M1 tumors (P < .05). This PDX model was
   generated from a previously untreated HNSCC. In contrast, MEDI5117 was
   not effective at reducing overall tumor volume for PDX models
   representing resistant disease (PDX-SCC-M0, PDX-SCC-M11). Low dose
   MEDI5117 (3 mg/kg) consistently decreased the fraction of cancer stem
   cells in PDX models of HNSCC when compared to IgG-treated controls, as
   follows: PDX-SCC-M0 (P < .001), PDX-SCC-M1 (P < .001), PDX-SCC-M11 (P =
   .04). Interestingly, high dose MEDI5117 (30 mg/kg) decreased the CSC
   fraction in the PDX-SCC-M11 model (P = .002), but not in PDX-SCC-M0 and
   PDX-SCC-M1. MEDI5117 mediated a dose-dependent decrease in the number of
   orospheres generated by ALDH(high)CD44(high) cells cultured in ultra-low
   attachment plates (P < .05), supporting an inhibitory effect on head and
   neck cancer stem cells. Notably, single agent MEDI5117 reduced the
   overall recurrence rate of PDX-SCC-M0, a PDX generated from the local
   recurrence of human HNSCC. Collectively, these data demonstrate that
   therapeutic inhibition of IL-6 with low-dose MEDI5117 decreases the
   fraction of cancer stem cells, and that adjuvant MEDI5117 inhibits
   recurrence in preclinical models of HNSCC.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructures have a significant effect on the performance of critical
   components in numerous aerospace metallic material applications.
   Examples include panels in airframes that are exposed to high
   temperatures and sensors used for vibration tuning. This paper addresses
   the techniques to optimize the microstructure design for polycrystalline
   metals. The microstructure is quantified with the orientation
   distribution function that determines the volume densities of crystals
   that make up the polycrystal microstructure. The orientation
   distribution function of polycrystalline alloys (e.g., hexagonal
   close-packed titanium) is represented in a discrete form, and the
   volume-averaged properties are computed through the orientation
   distribution function. The optimization is performed using the space of
   all possible volume-averaged macroproperties (stiffness and thermal
   expansion). A direct linear solver is employed to find the optimal
   orientation distribution functions. The direct solver is capable of
   finding exact solutions even for problems with multiple or infinite
   solutions. It is first applied to the optimization of the panel-buckling
   problem. The objective of the buckling optimization problem is to find
   the best microstructure design that maximizes the critical buckling
   temperature. The optimum solution computed with this approach is found
   to be same as the optimum solution of a global approach that uses a
   genetic algorithm. The linear solver methodology is extended to plastic
   properties and applied to explore the design of a Galfenol beam
   microstructure for vibration tuning with a yielding objective. The
   design approach is shown to lead to multiple optimum solutions.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an ADC-digital codesign approach to IF sampling digital
   beamforming (DBF) that combines continuous-time bandpass Delta Sigma
   modulators (CTBPDSMs) and bit-stream processing (BSP). This approach
   enables power-and area-efficient DBF by removing the need for digital
   multipliers and multiple decimators. The prototype beamformer digitizes
   eight 260 MHz IF signals at 1040 MS/s with eight CTBPDSMs, and performs
   digital down conversion and phase shifting with only multiplexers
   directly on the undecimated CTBPDSM outputs. With two sets of phase
   shifters, the prototype simultaneously forms two independent beams. Each
   phase shifter is controlled by a 12 bit programmable complex weight to
   provide a total of 240 phase-shift steps. By constructively combining
   inputs from eight elements, an 8.9 dB SNDR improvement is achieved,
   resulting in an array SNDR of 63.3 dB over a 10 MHz bandwidth.
   Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, the eight-element two-beam prototype
   beamformer is the first IC implementation of IF sampling DBF. It
   occupies 0.28 mm(2), and consumes 123.7 mW.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation and the water cycles are inherently coupled across a wide
   range of spatial and temporal scales. Water availability interacts with
   plant ecophysiology and controls vegetation functioning. Concurrently,
   vegetation has direct and indirect effects on energy, water, carbon, and
   nutrient cycles. To better understand and model plant-water
   interactions, highly interdisciplinary approaches are required. We
   present an overview of the main processes and relevant interactions
   between water and plants across a range of spatial scales, from the cell
   level of leaves, where stomatal controls occur, to drought stress at the
   level of a single tree, to the integrating scales of a watershed,
   region, and the globe. A review of process representations in models at
   different scales is presented. More specifically, three main model
   families are identified: (1) models of plant hydraulics that
   mechanistically simulate stomatal controls and/or water transport at the
   tree level; (2) ecohydrological models that simulate plot-to
   catchment-scale water, energy, and carbon fluxes; and (3) terrestrial
   biosphere models that simulate carbon, water, and nutrient dynamics at
   the regional and global scales and address feedback between Earth's
   vegetation and the climate system. We identify special features and
   similarities across the model families. Examples of where plant-water
   interactions are especially important and have led to key scientific
   findings are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss the various data
   sources that are currently available to force and validate existing
   models, and we present perspectives on the evolution of the field. (C)

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{49-60}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The effect of surface treatment using silanes on the frost durability is
   investigated on both laboratory and field specimens in an accelerated
   laboratory test. Measurements include moisture uptake during the
   pre-saturation and F-T stages, cumulative mass loss and internal bulk
   cracking under frost salt/water exposure. It is found silane treatment
   substantially reduces surface scaling, but cannot prevent bulk moisture
   uptake or the occurrence of the internal frost damage when concrete is
   insufficiently air entrained. Salt scaling is dominated by the capillary
   suction process in the thin surface region under freezing which can be
   curtailed by the pore lining effect from silanes creating a hydrophobic
   barrier to the ingress of external liquid. This in turn suppresses ice
   growth in the surface region, evidenced by the complete elimination of
   sub-freezing dilation in a length-change measurement of small-scale
   concrete specimens with surface treatment. However, internal frost
   damage is controlled by the universal degree of pore saturation which in
   turn is dependent on the bulk moisture uptake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{4331-4345}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Advanced combustion modes have drawn much attention from researchers due
   to increasingly strict emissions regulations. Partially premixed
   compression ignition (PCCI) combustion creates a partially premixed
   charge inside the cylinder before ignition occurs. As a result, NOx and
   particulate matter (PM) emissions can be reduced simultaneously relative
   to those of conventional diesel combustion. The basic operating
   mechanism of PCCI combustion is to prolong the time period for mixing of
   the fuel air mixture by separating the end of injection and start of
   combustion. Three different fuels, ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD), diesel
   fuel produced via a low temperature Fischer-Tropsch process (LTFT), and
   a renewable diesel (RD), which is a hydrotreated camelina oil, are
   tested in this study. Engine combustion performance, PM, NO; CO, total
   hydrocarbon (THC) emissions, particle size distribution, soot
   morphology, and nanostructure are examined for conventional combustion
   and various PCCI conditions. PCCI combustion can effectively reduce NOx
   and soot emissions with similar or slightly increased CO and THC
   emissions. Both LTFT and RD can reduce gaseous emissions compared to
   ULSD during PCCI combustion. However, because of the high viscosity of
   the renewable diesel used in this study, CO, THC, and PM emissions are
   higher than emissions from LTFT fuel during PCCI combustion.}},

Abstract = {{Making concurrent decisions on assembly plans and supply chain
   configurations (SCCs) is a desirable strategy in today's competitive
   global market. Such concurrent decisions help reduce decision iterations
   for shortened lead time and lower the total cost for manufacturers and
   their supply chains. However, there lacks deep understanding of the
   interaction between assembly plans and SCCs, as well as methodologies
   for integrating them. In this paper, we consider an assembly planning
   problem that simultaneously decomposes an assembly product to modules
   and assigns the modules to suppliers. The joint decision is formulated
   as an optimization problem of finding the assembly decomposition and the
   corresponding supply chain network with the lowest total supply chain
   cost. We develop a coordinated decision-making method by integrating
   assembly AND/OR graphs with supply chain cost information. A dynamic
   programing (DP) based algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the
   combined optimization problem. Case studies demonstrate that the
   proposed method can find optimal solutions for the integrated
   decision-making problem efficiently and provide a tool to plan
   assemblies from the perspective of the total supply chain cost in the
   early stages of product development.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a tool wear monitoring framework for ultrasonic
   metal welding which has been used for lithium-ion battery manufacturing.
   Tool wear has a significant impact on joining quality. In addition, tool
   replacement, including horns and anvils, constitutes an important part
   of production costs. Therefore, a tool condition monitoring (TCM) system
   is highly desirable for ultrasonic metal welding. However, it is very
   challenging to develop a TCM system due to the complexity of tool
   surface geometry and a lack of thorough understanding on the wear
   mechanism. Here, we first characterize tool wear progression by
   comparing surface measurements obtained at different stages of tool
   wear, and then develop a monitoring algorithm using a quadratic
   classifier and features that are extracted from space and frequency
   domains of cross-sectional profiles on tool surfaces. The developed
   algorithm is validated using tool measurement data from a battery plant.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetically induced transparency has the unique ability to
   optically control transparency windows with low light in atomic systems.
   However, its practical applications in quantum physics and information
   science are limited due to rigid experimental requirements. Here we
   demonstrate a new mechanism of optically induced transparency in a
   micro-cavity by introducing a four-wave mixing gain to nonlinearly
   couple two separated resonances of the micro-cavity in an ambient
   environment. A signature Fano-like resonance was observed owing to the
   nonlinear interference of the two coupled resonances. Moreover, we show
   that the unidirectional gain of the four-wave mixing can lead to the
   remarkable effect of non-reciprocal transmission at the transparency
   windows. Optically induced transparency may offer a unique platform for
   a compact, integrated solution to all-optical and quantum information.}},

Title = {{Microscopic origins of the terahertz carrier relaxation and cooling
   dynamics in graphene}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The ultrafast dynamics of hot carriers in graphene are key to both
   understanding of fundamental carrier-carrier interactions and
   carrier-phonon relaxation processes in two-dimensional materials, and
   understanding of the physics underlying novel high-speed electronic and
   optoelectronic devices. Many recent experiments on hot carriers using
   terahertz spectroscopy and related techniques have interpreted the
   variety of observed signals within phenomenological frameworks, and
   sometimes invoke extrinsic effects such as disorder. Here, we present an
   integrated experimental and theoretical programme, using ultrafast
   timeresolved terahertz spectroscopy combined with microscopic modelling,
   to systematically investigate the hot-carrier dynamics in a wide array
   of graphene samples having varying amounts of disorder and with either
   high or low doping levels. The theory reproduces the observed dynamics
   quantitatively without the need to invoke any fitting parameters,
   phenomenological models or extrinsic effects such as disorder. We
   demonstrate that the dynamics are dominated by the combined effect of
   efficient carrier-carrier scattering, which maintains a thermalized
   carrier distribution, and carrier-optical-phonon scattering, which
   removes energy from the carrier liquid.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) have shown great potential for
   generating prosthetic control signals. Translating BMIs into the clinic
   requires fully implantable, wireless systems; however, current solutions
   have high power requirements which limit their usability. Lowering this
   power consumption typically limits the system to a single neural
   modality, or signal type, and thus to a relatively small clinical
   market. Here, we address both of these issues by investigating the use
   of signal power in a single narrow frequency band as a decoding feature
   for extracting information from electrocorticographic (ECoG),
   electromyographic (EMG), and intracortical neural data. We have designed
   and tested the Multi-modal Implantable Neural Interface (MINI), a
   wireless recording system which extracts and transmits signal power in a
   single, configurable frequency band. In prerecorded datasets, we used
   the MINI to explore low frequency signal features and any resulting
   tradeoff between power savings and decoding performance losses. When
   processing intracortical data, the MINI achieved a power consumption
   89.7\% less than a more typical system designed to extract action
   potential waveforms. When processing ECoG and EMG data, the MINI
   achieved similar power reductions of 62.7\% and 78.8\%. At the same
   time, using the single signal feature extracted by the MINI, we were
   able to decode all three modalities with less than a 9\% drop in
   accuracy relative to using high-bandwidth, modality-specific signal
   features. We believe this system architecture can be used to produce a
   viable, cost-effective, clinical BMI.}},

Abstract = {{Lower limb amputees can use electrical activity from their residual
   muscles for myoelectric control of a powered prosthesis. The most common
   approach for myoelectric control is a finite state controller that
   identifies behavioral states and discrete changes in motor tasks. An
   alternative approach to state-based myoelectric control is continuous
   proportional myoelectric control where ongoing electrical activity has a
   proportional relationship to the prosthetic joint torque or power. To
   test the potential of continuous proportional myoelectric control for
   powered lower limb prostheses, we recruited five unilateral transtibial
   amputees to walk on a treadmill with an experimental powered prosthesis.
   Subjects walked using the powered prosthesis with and without visual
   feedback of their control signal in real time. Amputee subjects were
   able to adapt their residual muscle activation patterns to alter
   prosthetic ankle mechanics when we provided visual feedback of their
   myoelectric control signal in real time. During walking with visual
   feedback, subjects significantly increased their peak prosthetic ankle
   power (p = 0.02 ANOVA) and positive work (p = 0.02, ANOVA) during gait
   above their prescribed prosthesis values. However, without visual
   feedback, the subjects did not increase their peak ankle power during
   push off. These results show that amputee users were able to
   volitionally alter their prosthesis mechanics during walking, but only
   when given an explicit goal for their residual muscle motor commands.
   Future studies that examine the motor and learning capabilities of lower
   limb amputees using their residual muscles for continuous proportional
   myoelectric control are needed to determine the viability of integrating
   continuous high-level control with existing finite state prosthetic
   controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Pulmonary delivery has great potential for delivering biologics to the
   lung if the challenges of maintaining activity, stability, and ideal
   aerosol characteristics can be overcome. To study the interactions of a
   biologic in the lung, we chose butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) as our
   model enzyme, which has application for use as a bioscavenger protecting
   against organophosphate exposure or for use with pseudocholinesterase
   deficient patients. In mice, orotracheal administration of free BuChE
   resulted in 72 h detection in the lungs and 48 h in the broncheoalveolar
   lavage fluid (BALF). Free BuChE administered to the lung of all mouse
   backgrounds (Nude, C57BL/6, and BALB/c) showed evidence of an acute
   cytokine (IL-6, TNF-alpha, MIP2, and KC) and cellular immune response
   that subsided within 48 h, indicating relatively safe administration of
   this non-native biologic. We then developed a formulation of BuChE using
   Particle Replication in Non-Wetting Templates (PRINT). Aerosol
   characterization demonstrated biologically active BuChE 1 mu m
   cylindrical particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 2.77 mu
   m, indicative of promising airway deposition via dry powder inhalers
   (DPI). Furthermore, particulate BuChE delivered via dry powder
   insufflation showed residence time of 48 h in the lungs and BALF. The in
   vivo residence time, immune response, and safety of particulate BuChE
   delivered via a pulmonary route, along with the cascade impaction
   distribution of dry powder PRINT BuChE, showed promise in the ability to
   deliver active enzymes with ideal deposition characteristics. These
   findings provide evidence for the feasibility of optimizing the use of
   BuChE in the clinic; PRINT BuChE particles can be readily formulated for
   use in DPIs, providing a convenient and effective treatment option.}},

   or structures with local resonators, thus resulting in unavoidable
   distortion of waveforms. Here we show that, with helical-structured
   acoustic metamaterials, it is now possible to implement dispersion-free
   sound deceleration. The helical-structured metamaterials present a
   non-dispersive high effective refractive index that is tunable through
   adjusting the helicity of structures, while the wavefront revolution
   plays a dominant role in reducing the group velocity. Finally, we
   numerically and experimentally demonstrate that the helical-structured
   metamaterials with designed inhomogeneous unit cells can turn a normally
   incident plane wave into a self-accelerating beam on the prescribed
   parabolic trajectory. The helical-structured metamaterials will have
   profound impact to applications in explorations of slow wave physics.}},

Abstract = {{The structural response of beta-Ga2O3 to irradiation-induced electronic
   excitation was investigated. A polycrystalline pellet of this material
   was irradiated with 946 MeV Au ions and the resulting structural
   modifications were characterized using in situ X-ray diffraction
   analysis at various ion fluences, up to 1 x 10(13) cm(-2). Amorphization
   was induced, with the accumulation of the amorphous phase following a
   single-impact mechanism in which each ion produces an amorphous ion
   track along its path. Concurrent with this phase transformation, an
   increase in the unit cell volume of the material was observed and
   quantified using Rietveld refinement. This unit cell expansion increased
   as a function of ion fluence before saturating at 1.8\%. This effect is
   attributed to the generation of defects in an ion track shell region
   surrounding the amorphous track cores. The unit cell parameter increase
   was highly anisotropic, with no observed expansion in the {[}010]
   direction. This may be due to the structure of beta-Ga2O3, which
   exhibits empty channels of connected interstitial sites oriented in this
   direction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of tip-flow on vortex induced vibration of circular cylinders for
   Re < 1.2{*}10(5)}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{130-142}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{In two-dimensional experimental setups, tip-flow cannot be eliminated
   completely. In one degree-of freedom Flow Induced Motions (FIM) of
   circular cylinders placed perpendicular to a uniform flow,
   three-dimensional effects may become significant. An ideal setup extends
   the cylinder to the limits of the flow channel to minimize tip vortices,
   which reduce the effective length of the cylinder. Depending on how
   close to two-dimensional the experimental setup is, obtained results may
   differ. It is difficult to avoid the tip-flow in nature as well.
   Applications involving Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIV) have more or less
   three-dimensional flow characteristics and one of the manifestations of
   three-dimensionality is the tip flow. In this paper, the effects of
   tip-flow on VIV are investigated both experimentally and
   computationally. It is found that the tip-flow reduces the lift force
   exerted on the cylinder and narrows down the range of synchronization.
   Two-dimensional computational simulations become insufficient to grasp
   the effects of the tip-flow for a cylinder in VIV as the Reynolds number
   increases. Computational results for vortex-induced vibrations at these
   relatively high Reynolds numbers (up to 1.2{*}10(5)) in the TrSL3 flow
   regime are not satisfactory when compared with experimental results. To
   improve the CFD predictions by introducing three-dimensional (3D) flow
   characteristics in a two-dimensional (2D) computational environment, a
   parameter called tip-flow correction factor is defined and analyzed.
   This parameter is introduced to compensate for any deviations from 2D
   flow approximation that might arise due to the 3D nature of the flow.
   The tip-flow correction factor is implemented as a multiplier of the
   force term in the vibration equation to represent the lift-force losses
   caused by the tip vortex. When compared to the results obtained with
   straightforward use of the vibration equation, it is found that the
   tip-flow correction factor improves the agreement between 2D
   computational results and experimental measurements. This method extends
   the validity of 2D-URANS simulations at least up to Re = 1.2{*}10(5) for
   which experimental results are available in this study. (C) 2016

Title = {{A fast-running CFD formulation for unsteady ship maneuvering performance
   prediction}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{154-162}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Maneuvering prediction tools are important resources for naval and
   commercial ship designers. They can enable designers to determine
   maneuvering characteristics of a design prior to construction or be
   useful in redesign if a ship is underperforming. Numerical methods allow
   for multiple hulls to be compared digitally, so a certain level of
   optimization can be achieved through evaluating trade-offs among designs
   before construction. In this paper, a novel maneuvering prediction
   method is presented that seeks to provide the accuracy available from
   today state-of-the-art numerical viscous-flow tools but with
   significantly reduced computational cost. The numerical formulation is
   based on the unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations,
   and the unsteady ship generated waves are represented by the linear
   free-surface boundary conditions. The URANS equations are solved on an
   unstructured finite volume discretization of the fluid domain around the
   hull and its appendages. The linearized free-surface approximation
   accounts for first-order wave effects while reducing the necessary
   extent of the computational domain and level of grid refinement required
   by fully nonlinear methods that employ an interface-capturing technique.
   The resulting formulation provides a marked improvement in computational
   efficiency with respect to nonlinear methods and can empower naval
   architects to obtain accurate results earlier in the design process. (C)

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PLLA nanofibrous
   microspheres (NF-MS) as a cell delivery carrier in combination with
   controlled release of BMP-2 from PLGA microspheres on the induction of
   odontogenic differentiation of human stem cells of apical papilla
   (SCAP). Injectable NF-MS, which mimic the physical architecture of
   collagen fibers on the nano scale, were fabricated by combining
   thermally-induced phase separation techniques with an emulsification
   process. SCAP cultured in a mono layer or cultured on NF-MS in spinner
   flasks were treated with 100 ng/ml BMP-2 in vitro. Odontogenic
   differentiation was characterized by measuring alkaline phosphatase
   activity, odontogenic gene expression levels, calcium content, and
   dentin sialophosphoprotein accumulation. The results demonstrated that
   BMP-2 enhanced human SCAP odontogenic differentiation both in monolayer
   culture and on 3D NF-MS in spinner flask culture in vitro. We also
   developed and tested a system combining NF-MS with controlled BMP-2
   release for dentin regeneration in vivo. The results indicate that
   controlled release of BMP-2 promoted more mineralization and osteodentin
   formation compared to a BSA-releasing control in a dose-dependent and
   time-dependent manner. In summary, the NF-MS combined with controlled
   release of BMP-2 provides an excellent microenvironment for SCAP to
   regenerate dentin tissue.
   Statement of Significance
   Tooth lesion and loss affect masticatory efficiency, speaking function,
   facial aesthetics and even psychological health. Current treatments
   depend on ``inert{''} restorative materials, which do not have the
   healing capacity and may lead to the failure of the restorations over a
   long term. The aim of this study was to develop an injectable
   biomaterial and desired growth factor delivery system to support stem
   cells for mineralized dental tissue regeneration. The study showed that
   novel injectable and biodegradable nanofibrous microspheres and
   controlled release of BMP-2 synergistically induce the odontogenic
   differentiation of human stem cells from the apical papilla and
   mineralized tissue regeneration, demonstrating the potential of living
   dental tissue repair. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Lipid bilayers grafted with polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different sizes
   (M-w = 750, 2000, and 5000) and grafting densities (1.6-25 mol \% of
   PEGylated lipid in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid
   molecules) were simulated with human serum albumin (HSA) using coarse
   grained force fields. At low enough grafting density, the PEG has a
   conformation similar to that of an isolated chain in water, and its
   Flory radius R-F is smaller than the distance between the grafting
   points (d), which is the so-called ``mushroom{''} regime. In contrast,
   densely grafted PEG chains (R-F > d) extend like brushes, with brush
   layer thickness given by the Alexander-de Gennes theory. A nearly
   spherical HSA added to this simulation migrates to the bilayer surface
   because of the charge interactions between anion residues of HSA and
   cationic cholines of DPPC, but this HSA-bilayer binding can be
   sterically suppressed by the PEG chains to an extent that depends on the
   PEG size and grafting density. In particular, regardless of the extent
   of the coverage of the PEG on the bilayer, the binding between HSAs and
   bilayers is suppressed by the PEG layer in a brush but not in a
   mushroom, indicating that the attractive force between proteins and
   bilayers can overcome the steric effect of the PEG layer in the mushroom
   state or in the transition region from mushroom to brush. This helps
   explain and clarify experiments that show much less adsorption of plasma
   proteins onto the particle or membrane surface when PEGs are in the
   brush rather than in the mushroom state.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of reviewSurgical debulking of the adenoma/transition zone has
   been the fundamental principle which underpins transurethral resection
   of the prostate - still acknowledged to be the gold-standard therapy for
   benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, there has been a recent
   resurgence in development of new BPH technologies driven by enhanced
   understanding of prostate pathophysiology, development of new ablative
   technologies, and the need for less morbid alternatives as the mean age
   and complexity of the treatment population continues to increase. The
   objective of this review is to highlight new BPH technologies and review
   their available clinical data with specific emphasis on unique features
   of the technology, procedural effectiveness and safety, and potential
   impact on current treatment paradigms.Recent findingsNew technologies
   have emerged that alter the shape of the prostate to decrease urinary
   obstruction and enhance delivery of a lethal thermal dose by steam
   injection into the transition zone of the prostate. Energy can be
   delivered to the prostate via a beam of high-pressure saline or focused
   acoustic energy to mechanically disintegrate prostate tissue. Methods of
   cell death are being targeted with selectivity by the arterial supply
   with embolization and specific to prostate cells via injectable
   biological therapies.SummaryA number of new technologies are at various
   stages of development and improve on the transurethral resection of the
   prostate paradigm by moving closer to the ideal BPH therapy which is
   definitive, can be performed in minutes, in the office setting, with
   only local anesthesia and oral sedation.}},

   Systems Using Feedforward Technique}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An efficient method to mitigate the forward scattering (shadowing)
   effect and the near-field coupling among elements of broadband
   multiple-antenna communication systems is proposed. The technique is
   based on provision of a passive feedforward coupling among elements to
   cancel out the mutual couplings. Electrical current paths, with
   appropriate shape, location, and length, between adjacent elements are
   established to provide current distributions on adjacent elements that
   are approximately equal in magnitude and out of phase with the induced
   current on the same antenna due to the near-field coupling and
   scattering effects. As the coupling level decreases, the radiation
   pattern of an excited array element, in the presence of the other array
   elements, approaches the pattern of the antenna element in isolation.
   The technique is first detailed for a two-element wideband monoconical
   antenna array and is then extended to a uniform 12-element circular
   array of the same monoconical antennas where only feedforward paths are
   applied to circumferentially adjacent elements to reduce the coupling
   over a very wide bandwidth. The experimental results indicate that the
   application of the proposed feedforward technique to a 12-element
   circular array of monoconical antennas can provide a minimum of 2-dB
   reduction in the average gain deviation from omnidirectional radiation
   over an about 30\% fractional bandwidth. Another important feature of
   the feedforward technique is removal of radiation nulls of the array
   elements at all frequencies and all directions.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium (Li)-ion battery cells suffer from significant performance
   degradation at subzero temperatures. This paper presents a predictive
   control-based technique that exploits the increased internal resistance
   of Li-ion cells at subzero temperatures to increase the cell's
   temperature until the desired power can be delivered. Specifically, the
   magnitude of a sequence of bidirectional currents is optimized such as
   to minimize total energy discharged. The magnitude of current is
   determined by solving an optimization problem that satisfies the battery
   manufacturer's voltage and current constraints. Drawing bidirectional
   currents necessitates that a temporary energy reservoir for energy
   shuttling, such as an ultracapacitor or another battery, be available.
   When compared with the case when no penalty on energy withdrawn is
   imposed, simulations indicate that reductions of up to 20\% in energy
   dispensed as heat in the battery as well as in the size of external
   storage elements can be achieved at the expense of longer warm-up
   operation time.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates the ability of histotripsy to generate targeted
   lesions through the skullcap without using aberration correction.
   Histotripsy therapy was delivered using a 500-kHz 256-element
   hemispherical transducer with an aperture diameter of 30 cm, and a focal
   distance of 15 cm fabricated in our laboratory. This transducer is
   theoretically capable of producing peak rarefactional pressures, based
   on linear estimation, (p-)(LE), in the free field in excess of 200 MPa
   with pulse durations <= 2 acoustic cycles. Three excised human skullcaps
   were used displaying attenuations of 73\%-81\% of the acoustic pressure
   without aberration correction. Through all three skullcaps, compact
   lesions with radii less than 1mmwere generated in red blood cell agarose
   tissue phantoms without aberration correction, using estimated (p-) LE
   of 28-39 MPa, a pulse repetition frequency of 1 Hz, and a total number
   of 300 pulses. Lesion generation was consistently observed at the
   geometric focus of the transducer as the position of the skullcap with
   respect to the transducer was varied, and multiple-patterned lesions
   were generated transcranially by mechanically adjusting the position of
   the skullcap with respect to the transducer to target different regions
   within. These results show that compact targeted lesions with sharp
   boundaries can be generated through intact skullcaps using histotripsy
   with very short pulses without using aberration correction. Such
   capability has the potential to greatly simplify transcranial ultrasound
   therapy for noninvasive transcranial applications, as current ultrasound
   transcranial therapy techniques all require sophisticated aberration
   correction.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An equivalent frame is developed to simulate the effect of a large-size
   truck colliding with a reinforced-concrete column. The surrogate frame
   is made of simple steel elements and blocks, representing the major
   features of a reference truck. Equivalence between the frame and actual
   truck is achieved by comparing their deformation versus internal energy
   relationships. The equivalent truck frame is scaled down and used in
   laboratory tests to study the collision process between trucks and
   bridge piers, thereby significantly reducing the difficulty and cost of
   conducting full-scale collision tests while maintaining high fidelity.
   Using the scaled surrogate frames, three drop-weight impact tests are
   conducted on circular reinforced-concrete model columns. Test results
   show that the structural responses of the columns are not only
   influenced by the impact energy itself but also the impact speed and
   impactor mass. Finite-element simulations of the collision process are
   conducted using both the equivalent truck frame and the reference truck,
   confirming the overall similarity between them. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{As renewable energy penetration rates continue to increase in power
   systems worldwide, new challenges arise for system operators in both
   regulated and deregulated electricity markets to solve the
   security-constrained coal-fired unit commitment problem with
   intermittent generation (due to renewables) and uncertain load, in order
   to ensure system reliability and maintain cost effectiveness. In this
   paper, we study a security-constrained coal-fired stochastic unit
   commitment model, which we use to enhance the reliability unit
   commitment process for day-ahead power system operations. In our
   approach, we first develop a deterministic equivalent formulation for
   the problem, which leads to a large-scale mixed-integer linear program.
   Then, we verify that the turn on/off inequalities provide a convex hull
   representation of the minimum-up/down time polytope under the stochastic
   setting. Next, we develop several families of strong valid inequalities
   mainly through lifting schemes. In particular, by exploring sequence
   independent lifting and subadditive approximation lifting properties for
   the lifting schemes, we obtain strong valid inequalities for the ramping
   and general load balance polytopes. Finally, branch-and-cut algorithms
   are developed to employ these valid inequalities as cutting planes to
   solve the problem. Our computational results verify the effectiveness of
   the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a problem of scheduling appointments with random
   service durations on multiple servers with operating time limits. We
   minimize the cost of operating servers and serving appointments, subject
   to a joint chance constraint limiting the risk of server running
   overtime. With finite samples of random service time, we consider a
   mixed-integer linear programming extended formulation and propose a
   two-stage decomposition framework with cutting planes. The first stage
   considers a relaxed master problem as a variant of the
   chance-constrained binary packing problem discussed in Song et al.
   (INFORMS J Comput 26(4):735-747, 2014), which packs appointments into
   servers under chance-constrained server overtime. Given
   appointment-to-server assignments, the second stage seeks feasible
   schedules on individual servers. We propose strengthening, bounding, and
   branch-and-cut methods for computing problems in both stages. Via
   testing instances with diverse sizes, we compare different decomposition
   schemes. In particular, we demonstrate the efficacy of our
   branch-and-cut algorithm that incorporates server-based decomposition
   for optimizing the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical interatomic potentials of a molybdenum-erbium (Mo-Er) system
   are developed based on a Tersoff-Brenner-type form. The potentials well
   describes the bulk and defect properties of bcc Mo, including lattice
   parameter, cohesive energy, elastic constants, formation energies of
   point defects, surface energies and melting point. The adsorption
   behavior of Er on a Mo (1 1 0) surface is studied using ab initio
   calculations based on the density functional theory, which is used to
   fit the interatomic potential of a Mo-Er interaction. The growth
   mechanism of the Er film on a Mo substrate is investigated using the
   present potentials. The simulation results show that the microstructures
   and morphologies of Er films are sensitive to substrate temperatures.
   Columnar grains of hexagonal close-packed Er parallel to a Mo (1 1 0)
   surface are observed and the grain sizes increase with increasing
   substrate temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Recently developed advanced scintillators, which have the ability to
   distinguish gamma-ray interaction events from those that accompany
   neutron impact, require improved quantum efficiency in the blue to near
   UV region of the spectrum. We utilize GaAs/Al0.8Ga0.2As photodiode
   elements as components in a wide band-gap solid-state photomultiplier as
   a lower-cost, lower logistical burden, and higher quantum efficiency
   replacement for the photomultiplier tube. An AlAs window layer is
   employed as a means to increase the diode's optical performance.
   Relative to structures absent the window layer, simulations and
   measurements demonstrate that the AlAs layer produces a spatial
   coincidence between regions of large drift fields with regions of high
   photon absorption. In addition to the AlAs layer, secondary ion mass
   spectrometry measurements show that an unexpected high degree of
   inter-diffusion of GaAs and AlAs quenches the photon-detection
   efficiency, a decrease that can be avoided by its post-growth removal.
   With the AlAs layer, the peak external quantum efficiency of 49\% is
   achieved at 450 nm with 10 V reverse bias, which does not fully deplete
   the device. Simulations show that full depletion can result in
   efficiencies exceeding 90\%. In order to enhance the optical response, a
   simple anti-reflective coating layer is designed using the existing
   passivation layer components that successfully minimizes the reflection
   at the wavelength range of interest (300 nm-500 nm).}},

Abstract = {{Soy protein concentrate was hydrothermally treated at isothermal
   temperatures of 200, 250, 300, and 350 degrees C for times up to 60 min
   to produce a crude bio-oil. Additional product fractions included
   water-soluble products, gases, and residual solids. We report herein the
   conversion of protein and gravimetric yields of the different product
   fractions. The biocrude yield generally increased with both time and
   temperature as did the yield of gaseous products. The highest biocrude
   yield was 34\%, produced from liquefaction at 350 degrees C for 60 min.
   Chemical and physical characterization of the biocrude revealed how its
   composition and boiling point range changed with reaction time. Finally,
   we report a reaction network and the parameters for a phenomenological
   kinetics model that captures the influence of time and temperature on
   the yields of gas, solid, biocrude, and aqueous-phase products from
   isothermal hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of soy protein concentrate.
   The reaction network comprised a sole primary path, which converted soy
   protein concentrate to aqueous-phase products. Secondary reactions of
   these water-soluble compounds produced biocrude and gases. There was no
   direct path to biocrude formation from the biomass feedstock.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a mathematical model of the metabolic feedback and
   adrenergic feedforward control of coronary blood flow that occur during
   variations in the cardiac workload. It is based on the physiological
   observations that coronary blood flow closely follows myocardial oxygen
   demand, that myocardial oxygen debts are repaid, and that control
   oscillations occur when the system is perturbed and so are
   phenomenological in nature. Using clinical data, we demonstrate that the
   model can provide patient-specific estimates of coronary blood flow
   changes between rest and exercise, requiring only the patient's heart
   rate and peak aortic pressure as input. The model can be used in
   zero-dimensional lumped parameter network studies or as a boundary
   condition for three-dimensional multidomain Navier-Stokes blood flow
   simulations. For the first time, this model provides feedback control of
   the coronary vascular resistance, which can be used to enhance the
   physiological accuracy of any hemodynamic simulation, which includes
   both a heart model and coronary arteries. This has particular relevance
   to patient-specific simulation for which heart rate and aortic pressure
   recordings are available. In addition to providing a simulation tool,
   under our assumptions, the derivation of our model shows that
   beta-feedforward control of the coronary microvascular resistance is a
   mathematical necessity and that the metabolic feedback control must be
   dependent on two error signals: the historical myocardial oxygen debt,
   and the instantaneous myocardial oxygen deficit.}},

Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{308-319}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have led to significant improvements in the prediction of
   particulate matter (PM) emissions from gasoline vehicles based on
   differences in fuel composition. This is an issue that has taken on
   increased importance recently given the introduction of gasoline direct
   injection (GDI) technology to improve fuel economy and the challenges it
   has meeting new stringent PM emissions standards. One productive effort
   in this area is the PM Index (PMI) developed by Aikawa and
   collaborators. This approach relates the effects of fuel composition on
   its PM forming potential. The present work explores the use of
   experimental smoke point measurements and various fuel volatility
   metrics to better characterize these effects. Smoke point (SP) values as
   scaled by the Oxygen Extended Sooting Index (OESI) incorporate all fuel
   molecular structural effects known to have an impact on soot formation,
   including branching, degree of saturation, carbon chain length, and
   oxygenate functional group effects. A strong correlation is found for
   vehicle-level particle number (PN) and PM emissions with SP, OESI and
   PMI. Fuel volatility effects are considered, including characteristics
   derived from molecular weight, distillation, vapor pressure, and heat of
   vaporization. For hydrocarbon blends, no volatility factor significantly
   improved the correlation as compared to PMI, SP, or OESI alone. However,
   inclusion of a heat of vaporization term with OESI better matched the
   emissions trend for ethanol-gasoline blends. Sooting tendencies for
   n-butanol- and isobutanol-gasoline blends exhibited trends similar to
   those with ethanol. (C) 2016 The Combustion Institute. Published by

   Non-blocking All Inclusive Controller (NB-AIC), that embeds all safe and
   non-blocking supervisors. We present an algorithm for the construction
   of the NB-AIC and discuss its properties. We obtain the necessary and
   sufficient conditions for the solvability of the maximally permissive
   control problem. We then provide a synthesis algorithm, based on the
   NB-AIC, that constructs a supervisor that is safe, non-blocking and
   maximally permissive, if one exists. This is the first algorithm with
   such properties.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces Manhattan sampling in two and higher dimensions,
   and proves sampling theorems for them. In 2-D, Manhattan sampling, which
   takes samples densely along a Manhattan grid of lines, can be viewed as
   sampling on the union of two rectangular lattices, one dense
   horizontally and the other vertically, with the coarse spacing of each
   being a multiple of the fine spacing of the other. The sampling theorem
   shows that the images bandlimited to the union of the Nyquist regions of
   the two rectangular lattices can be recovered from their Manhattan
   samples, and an efficient procedure for doing so is given. Such recovery
   is possible even though there is an overlap among the spectral replicas
   induced by Manhattan sampling. In three and higher dimensions, there are
   many possible configurations for Manhattan sampling, each consisting of
   the union of special rectangular lattices called bi-step lattices. This
   paper identifies them, proves a sampling theorem showing that the images
   bandlimited to the union of the Nyquist regions of the bi-step
   rectangular lattices are recoverable from Manhattan samples, presents an
   efficient onion-peeling procedure for doing so, and shows that the union
   of Nyquist regions is as large as any bandlimited region, such that all
   images supported by such can be stably reconstructed from samples taken
   at the rate of the Manhattan sampling. It also develops a special
   representation for the bi-step lattices with a number of useful
   properties. While most of this paper deals with continuous-space images,
   Manhattan sampling of discrete-space images is also considered, for
   infinite, as well as finite, support images.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Demand response could provide reserves to power systems and market
   designs should enable cost-efficient exploitation of these resources. In
   direct load control programs, consumers provide demand response in
   exchange for incentive payments. The success of such contracts is a
   function of level of information sharing, consumer costs, and power
   system constraints/costs. In this paper, we compare three approaches to
   contract design, each of which assumes different levels of consumer
   privacy. Our aim is to explore tradeoffs between privacy, resource
   exploitation, and the reward earned by the load aggregator. The first
   approach assumes full and truthful information exchange between the
   consumer and the system operator. We then develop a novel centralized
   approach in which an aggregator applies mechanism design to offer
   contracts to consumers who reveal partial cost information. A novel
   decentralized approach is developed in which consumers act cooperatively
   to pool demand response reserves, enabling them to keep individual cost
   information private. Through simulation studies, we find that, in the
   centralized approach, resource exploitation/rewards are highly sensitive
   to the accuracy of the load aggregator's consumer cost curves
   approximations. We also find that in the decentralized approach, rewards
   can be small, especially if information exchange is costly.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a two-stage framework for the economic operation of
   a microgrid-like electric vehicle (EV) parking deck with on-site
   renewable energy generation (roof-top photovoltaic panel). This
   microgrid-like EV parking deck is a localized grouping of distributed
   generation (solar), energy storage (EV batteries), and load (EV charging
   load). Although EV parking decks can enable greater adoption of
   renewable energy sources by scheduling charging loads to coincide with
   periods of strong sun, the inherent intermittency of renewable energy
   resources and variable EV parking behaviors complicates the economic
   operation. In this paper, the proposed first stage of this framework
   provides the parking deck operators with a stochastic approach for
   dealing with the uncertainty of solar energy so as to make an optimal
   price decision (marginal electricity sale price and parking fee rebate)
   at the day-ahead time scale. The second stage introduces a model
   predictive control-based operation strategy of EV charging dealing with
   the uncertainty of parking behaviors within the real-time operation.
   Case studies demonstrate the better performance of the proposed
   framework, offering an effective day-ahead marginal electricity price
   for tomorrow's operation and increasing the microgrid-like EV parking
   deck's revenue during the real-time operation.}},

Abstract = {{In situ aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, conducted
   in forming gas (5\% H-2/N-2) at atmospheric pressure and elevated
   temperatures (up to 800 degrees C), was used to follow the growth of Pt
   nanoparticles dispersed on a high-surface-area Al2O3 support. These
   direct observations, facilitated by the use of monodisperse Pt
   nanoparticles, allowed for an unambiguous separation of the relative
   contributions of Ostwald ripening and particle migration/coalescence to
   the overall growth process and made possible the estimation of
   corresponding energetic and kinetic parameters. Whereas the parameters
   describing Ostwald ripening were as expected, the diffusion coefficient
   characterizing particle migration was surprisingly small. Size-selection
   methods were thus shown to have significant potential for suppressing
   Ostwald ripening, the dominant growth process, in practical catalysts.

Abstract = {{Projects with repeating activities, such as multistory buildings and
   highways, present unique scheduling challenges. This paper presents the
   necessary requirements that scheduling systems should address to meet
   the needs and complexities of repetitive projects in practice. The
   repetitive scheduling method (RSM) provides a unified scheduling
   framework that applies to all types of repetitive projects. In RSM,
   projects are classified as discrete (vertical) or continuous (horizontal
   or linear) and then as uniform and nonuniform, depending on whether
   progress is measured using a counting scale or a dominant-attribute
   scale. RSM modeling elements include three types of activities (line,
   block, and bar) and 10 types of relationships (links) between
   activities. RP2, a computer program developed by the authors to validate
   the proposed scheduling approach, is used to develop the production
   diagrams and tabular reports of the target schedule for a complex of
   four-story apartment buildings for a low-income housing project.
   Sufficient detail is provided so that the project and its target
   schedule can be used to validate future research and to verify other

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a system for an autonomous underwater vehicle to
   perform in situ, multiple session hull inspection using long-term
   simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Our method assumes very
   little a priori knowledge, and it does not require the aid of acoustic
   beacons for navigation, which is a typical mode of navigation in this
   type of application. Our system combines recent techniques in underwater
   saliency-informed visual SLAM and a method for representing the ship
   hull surface as a collection of many locally planar surface features.
   This methodology produces accurate maps that can be constructed in
   real-time on consumer-grade computing hardware. A single-session SLAM
   result is initially used as a prior map for later sessions, where the
   robot automatically merges the multiple surveys into a common
   hull-relative reference frame. To perform the relocalization step, we
   use a particle filter that leverages the locally planar representation
   of the ship hull surface, and a fast visual descriptor matching
   algorithm. Finally, we apply the recently developed graph sparsification
   tool, generic linear constraints, as a way to manage the computational
   complexity of the SLAM system as the robot accumulates information
   across multiple sessions. We show results for 20 SLAM sessions for two
   large vessels over the course of days, months, and even up to three
   years, with a total path length of approximately 10.2 km.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Residents in training are often directed to insert screws
   using ``two-finger tightness{''} to impart adequate torque but minimize
   the chance of a screw stripping in bone. This study seeks to quantify
   and describe two-finger tightness and to assess the variability of its
   application by residents in training.
   Methods: Cortical bone was simulated using a polyurethane foam block
   (30-pcf density) that was prepared with predrilled holes for tightening
   3.5 x 14-mm long cortical screws and mounted to a custom-built apparatus
   on a load cell to capture torque data. Thirty-three residents in
   training, ranging from the first through fifth years of residency, along
   with 8 staff members, were directed to tighten 6 screws to two-finger
   tightness in the test block, and peak torque values were recorded. The
   participants were blinded to their torque values.
   Results: Stripping torque (2.73 +/- 0.56 N.m) was determined from 36
   trials and served as a threshold for failed screw placement. The average
   torques varied substantially with regard to absolute torque values, thus
   poorly defining two-finger tightness. Junior residents less consistently
   reproduced torque compared with other groups (0.29 and 0.32,
   respectively).
   Conclusions: These data quantify absolute values of two-finger tightness
   but demonstrate considerable variability in absolute torque values,
   percentage of stripping torque, and ability to consistently reproduce
   given torque levels. Increased years in training are weakly correlated
   with reproducibility, but experience does not seem to affect absolute
   torque levels. These results question the usefulness of two-finger
   tightness as a teaching tool and highlight the need for improvement in
   resident motor skill training and development within a teaching
   curriculum. Torque measuring devices may be a useful simulation tools
   for this purpose.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the development of a mixed-variable optimization
   framework for the design of composite rotor blades with active flaps in

   function, and it is shown that there is a direct correlation between the
   amplitude of dynamic twist and the vibration reduction authority of
   active flaps. The optimization framework developed includes Intelligent
   Cross-section Generator as the cross section and mesh generator,
   University of Michigan/Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional Analysis
   for the cross-sectional analysis, and Rotorcraft Comprehensive Analysis
   System for the aeroelastic analysis of active rotor blades. The
   optimization problem is solved using a surrogate-based approach in
   combination with the efficient global optimization algorithm. The

Abstract = {{The multifunctionality and versatility of skeletal muscle is a worthy
   inspiration towards the development of engineered adaptive structures
   and material systems. Recent mechanical modeling of muscle suggests that
   some of muscle's intriguing macroscale, passive adaptivity results from
   the assembly of nanoscale, cross-bridge constituents that maintain
   multiple metastable configurations. Inspired by the new observations,
   this research explores a concept of creating modular, engineered
   structures from the assembly of mechanical, metastable modules, defined
   as modules that exhibit coexistent metastable states. The proposed
   integrated systems are termed metastructures: modular, engineered
   structures exhibiting unprecedented characteristics resulting from a
   synergy of the constituents. Analytical and experimental results
   demonstrate that when modular metastructures are prescribed a global
   shape/topology, the systems may yield significant and valuable
   properties adaptivity including variation in reaction force magnitude
   and direction, numerous globally stable topologies, and orders of
   magnitude change in stiffness. The influences of important parameters on
   tailoring the displacement range of coexistent metastable states are
   investigated to provide insight of how the assembly strategy governs the
   intriguing versatility and functionality which may be harnessed.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce carbon emission, transportation sector has adapted lithium-ion
   battery-based hybridization of gasoline and diesel engines due to its
   efficiency, the availability of technologies, and nationwide
   infrastructures. To cut prismatic and cylindrical electrodes for
   lithium-ion batteries, die cutting and rotary knife slitting have been
   used. Both techniques have disadvantages such as tool wear, process
   instability, inconsistency of cut quality, and redesign of mechanical
   cutting processes due to various battery sizes. High speed remote laser
   cutting overcomes these disadvantages with characteristics such as
   contact-free process, high energy concentration, low noise level, fast
   processing speed, very narrow heat affected zone, applicability to
   nearly all materials, and flexibility of laser power. Optimization of
   key parameters, or power and scanning speed, has been presented for
   laser cutting of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. An acceptable
   clearance width is observed. The line energy is defined as dividing
   laser power by scanning speed and spot size. A good quality of cut
   surface, with no defects, such as delamination, burrs, edge bending, or
   microsized material attachments, is achieved with line energies between
   0.8 x 10(12) and 2.5 x 10(12) J m(-3) for anode and 0.31 x 10(12) Jm(-3)

Abstract = {{Characterization of the microscale mechanical properties of biomaterials
   is a key challenge in the field of mechanobiology. Dual-mode ultrasound
   elastography (DUE) uses high frequency focused ultrasound to induce
   compression in a sample, combined with interleaved ultrasound imaging to
   measure the resulting deformation. This technique can be used to
   non-invasively perform creep testing on hydrogel biomaterials to
   characterize their viscoelastic properties. DUE was applied to a range
   of hydrogel constructs consisting of either hydroxyapatite (HA)-doped
   agarose, HA-collagen, HA-fibrin, or preosteoblast-seeded collagen
   constructs. DUE provided spatial and temporal mapping of local and bulk
   displacements and strains at high resolution. Hydrogel materials
   exhibited characteristic creep behavior, and the maximum strain and
   residual strain were both material- and concentration-dependent.
   Burger's viscoelastic model was used to extract characteristic
   parameters describing material behavior. Increased protein concentration
   resulted in greater stiffness and viscosity, but did not affect the
   viscoelastic time constant of acellular constructs. Collagen constructs
   exhibited significantly higher modulus and viscosity than fibrin
   constructs. Cell-seeded collagen constructs became stiffer with altered
   mechanical behavior as they developed over time. Importantly, DUE also
   provides insight into the spatial variation of viscoelastic properties
   at sub-millimeter resolution, allowing interrogation of the interior of
   constructs. DUE presents a novel technique for non-invasively
   characterizing hydrogel materials at the microscale, and therefore may
   have unique utility in the study of mechanobiology and the
   characterization of hydrogel biomaterials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{The Development and Evaluation of Countermeasures to Tactile Change
   Blindness}},
Journal = {{HUMAN FACTORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{482-495}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of the present study was to develop and empirically
   evaluate three countermeasures to tactile change blindness (where a
   tactile signal is missed in the presence of a tactile transient). Each
   of these countermeasures relates to a different cognitive step involved
   in successful change detection.
   Background: To date, change blindness has been studied primarily in
   vision, but there is limited empirical evidence that the tactile
   modality may also be subject to this phenomenon. Change blindness raises
   concerns regarding the robustness of tactile and multimodal interfaces.
   Method: Three countermeasures to tactile change blindness were evaluated
   in the context of a highly demanding monitoring task. One countermeasure
   was proactive (alerting the participant to a possible change before it
   occurred) whereas the other two were adaptive (triggered after the
   change upon an observed miss). Performance and subjective data were
   collected.
   Results: Compared to the baseline condition, all countermeasures
   improved intramodal tactile change detection. Adaptive measures resulted
   in the highest detection rates, specifically when signal gradation was
   employed (i.e., when the intensity of the tactile signal was increased
   after a miss was observed).
   Conclusion: Adaptive displays can be used to counter the effects of
   change blindness and ensure that tactile information is reliably
   detected. Increasing the tactile intensity after a missed change appears
   most promising and was the preferred countermeasure.
   Application: The findings from this study can inform the design of
   interfaces employing the tactile modality to support monitoring and
   attention management in data-rich domains.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Bubbles populations in the wake of a partial cavity resulting from gas
   diffusion were measured to determine the noncondensable gas flux into
   the cavity. The diffusion rate is related to the dissolved gas content,
   the local cavity pressure, and the flow within and around the cavity.
   The measurements are used to revisit various scaling relationships for
   the gas diffusion, and it is found that traditional scaling that assumes
   the presence of a gas pocket overpredicts the gas diffusion. A new
   scaling based on diffusion into the low void fraction bubbly mixture
   within the partial cavity is proposed, and it is shown to adequately
   scale the observed production of gas bubbles for dissolved air
   saturation from 30\% to 70\% at 1 atm, limited cavities on the order of
   0.3-3 cm in length at a free-stream speed of 8 m/s (sigma = 2.3-3.3 and

Abstract = {{Earlier efforts have identified an algorithm that uses active neutron
   interrogation to find explosives hidden in cargo containers. This
   algorithm uses flags, in the form of specific mathematical manipulations
   of the exiting neutron and photon radiation at different angles, to
   classify the cargo type, search for hidden explosives, and minimize
   certain false positives due to cargo heterogeneities. Statistical
   modeling software has now been applied to the previously-identified
   flags in an effort to improve the detection algorithm. The new detection
   models have shown accurate results exceeding 95 \% for simplified
   screening scenarios 80-90 \% when more realistic conditions are
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon materials are used in a diverse set of applications ranging from
   pharmaceuticals to catalysis. Nitrogen modification of carbon powders
   has shown to be an effective method for enhancing both surface and bulk
   properties of as-received material for a number of applications.
   Unfortunately, control of the nitrogen modification process is
   challenging and can limit the effectiveness and reproducibility of
   N-doped materials. Additionally, the assignment of functional groups to
   specific moieties on the surface of nitrogen-modified carbon materials
   is not straightforward. Herein, we complete an in-depth analysis of
   functional groups present at the surface of ion-implanted Vulcan and
   Graphitic Vulcan through the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) and near edge X-ray adsorption fine structure spectroscopy
   (NEXAFS). Our results show that regardless of the initial starting
   materials used, nitrogen ion implantation conditions can be tuned to
   increase the amount of nitrogen incorporation and to obtain both similar
   and reproducible final distributions of nitrogen functional groups. The
   development of a well-controlled/reproducible nitrogen implantation
   pathway opens the door for carbon supported catalyst architectures to
   have improved numbers of nucleation sites, decreased particle size, and
   enhanced catalyst-support interactions. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \&

Title = {{Automated hazardous area identification using laborers' actual and
   optimal routes}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{21-32}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Approximately 20\% of accidents in construction industry occur while
   workers are moving through a construction site. Current construction
   hazard identification mostly relies on safety managers' capabilities to
   detect hazards. Consequently, numerous hazards remain unidentified, and
   unidentified hazards mean that hazards are not included in the safety
   management process. To enhance the capability of hazard identification,
   this paper proposes an automated hazardous area identification model
   based on the deviation between the optimal route (shortest path) which
   is determined by extracting nodes from objects in a building information
   model (BIM) and the actual route of a laborer collected from the
   real-time location system (RTLS). The hazardous area identification
   framework consists of six DBs and three modules. The unidentified
   hazardous area identification module identifies potentially hazardous
   areas (PHAs) in laborers' paths. The filtering hazardous area module
   reduces the range of possible hazardous areas to improve the efficiency
   of safety management The monitoring and output, generation module
   provides reports including hazardous area information. The suggested
   model can identify a hazard automatically and decrease the time laborers
   are exposed to a hazard. This can help improve both the effectiveness of
   the hazard identification process and enhance the safety for laborers.

Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},

Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{51-64}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Marker-based pose estimation, in which optical cameras monitor fiducial
   markers to determine the three-dimensional positioning and orientation
   of an articulated machine's end effector, has been identified as a
   potential low-cost alternative to currently available machine control
   and guidance systems. In an effort to develop such a marker-based pose
   estimation system for excavators, several iterations of prototypes were
   designed, fabricated, and tested. Performance was measured in terms of
   the system's ability to estimate bucket tooth position, with an
   acceptance criterion of 2.5 cm (1 in.) of absolute error. Although
   initial prototypes were found to possess practicality and performance
   issues, a fourth prototype offered encouraging experimental results
   suggesting the feasibility of marker-based sensor technology for
   excavator pose estimation. Further work needed to refine the technology
   for large-scale practical implementation was also identified. (C) 2016

Title = {{A Model to Optimize Followup Care and Reduce Hospital Readmissions after
   Radical Cystectomy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{195}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1362-1367}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Radical cystectomy has one of the highest readmission rates
   across all surgical procedures at approximately 25\%. We developed a
   mathematical model to optimize outpatient followup regimens for radical
   cystectomy.
   Materials and Methods: We used delay-time analysis, a systems
   engineering approach, to maximize the probability of detecting patients
   susceptible to readmission through office visits and telephone calls.
   Our data source includes patients readmitted after radical cystectomy
   from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient
   Databases in 2009 and 2010 as well as from our institutional bladder
   cancer database from 2007 to 2011. We measured the interval from
   hospital discharge to the point when a patient first exhibits concerning
   symptoms. Our primary end point is 30-day hospital readmission. Our
   model optimized the timing and sequence of followup care after radical
   cystectomy.
   Results: The timing of office visits and telephone calls is more
   important in detecting a patient at risk for readmission than the
   sequence of these encounters. Patients are most likely to exhibit
   concerning symptoms between 4 and 5 days after discharge home. An
   optimally scheduled office visit can detect up to 16\% of potential
   readmissions, which can be increased to 36\% with 1 office visit
   followed by 4 telephone calls.
   Conclusions: Our model improves the detection of concerning symptoms
   after radical cystectomy by optimizing the timing and number of
   outpatient encounters. By understanding how to design better outpatient
   followup care for patients treated with radical cystectomy we can help
   reduce the readmission burden for this population.}},

Title = {{Electroactive biodegradable polyurethane significantly enhanced Schwann
   cells myelin gene expression and neurotrophin secretion for peripheral
   nerve tissue engineering}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{18-31}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Myelination of Schwann cells (SCs) is critical for the success of
   peripheral nerve regeneration, and biomaterials that can promote SCs'
   neurotrophin secretion as scaffolds are beneficial for nerve repair.
   Here we present a biomaterials-approach, specifically, a highly tunable
   conductive biodegradable flexible polyurethane by polycondensation of
   poly(glycerol sebacate) and aniline pentamer, to significantly enhance
   SCs' myelin gene expression and neurotrophin secretion for peripheral
   nerve tissue engineering. SCs are cultured on these conductive polymer
   films, and the biocompatibility of these films and their ability to
   enhance myelin gene expressions and sustained neurotrophin secretion are
   successfully demonstrated. The mechanism of SCs' neurotrophin secretion
   on conductive films is demonstrated by investigating the relationship
   between intracellular Ca2+ level and SCs' myelination. Furthermore, the
   neurite growth and elongation of PC12 cells are induced by adding the
   neurotrophin medium suspension produced from SCs-laden conductive films.
   These data suggest that these conductive degradable polyurethanes that
   enhance SCs' myelin gene expressions and sustained neurotrophin
   secretion perform great potential for nerve regeneration applications.

Abstract = {{Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) with a
   temperature-programmed microfabricated thermal modulator (mu TM) is
   demonstrated. The 0.78 cm(2), 2-stage mu TM chip with integrated heaters
   and a PDMS coated microchannel was placed in thermal contact with a
   solid-state thermoelectric cooler and mounted on top of a bench scale
   GC. It was fluidically coupled through heated interconnects to an
   upstream first-dimension (D-1) PDMS-coated capillary column and a
   downstream uncoated capillary or second-dimension (D-2) PEG-coated
   capillary. A mixture of n-alkanes C-6-C-10 was separated isothermally
   and the full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) values of the modulated peaks
   were assessed as a function of the computer-controlled minimum and
   maximum stage temperatures of mu TM, T-min, and T-max, respectively.
   With T-min, and T-max fixed at -25 and 100 degrees C, respectively,
   modulated peaks of C-6 and C-7 had fwhm values <53 ms while the
   modulated peaks of C-10 had a fwhm value of 1.3 s, due to inefficient
   re-mobilization. With T-min and T-max fixed at 0 and 210 degrees C,
   respectively, the fwhm value for the modulated C10 peaks decreased to 67
   ms, but C-6 and C-7 exhibited massive breakthrough. By programming T-min
   from -25 to 0 degrees C and Tmax from 100 to 220 degrees C, the C-6 and
   C-7 peaks had fwhm values <= 50 ms, and the fwhm for C-10 peaks remained
   <95 ms. Using the latter conditions for the GC x GC separation of a
   sample of unleaded gasoline yielded resolution similar to that reported
   with a commercial thermal modulator. Replacing the PDMS phase in the mu
   TM with a trigonal-tricationic room temperature ionic liquid eliminated
   the bleed observed with the PDMS, but also reduced the capacity for
   several test compounds. Regardless, the demonstrated capability to
   independently temperature program this low resource mu TM enhances its
   versatility and its promise for use in bench-scale GC x GC systems. (C)

Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{We present a unified approach to cascaded stimulated Brillouin
   scattering and frequency-comb generation in which the multitude of
   interacting pump, Stokes, and anti-Stokes optical fields is described by
   a single forward wave and a single backward wave at a single carrier
   frequency. The envelopes of these two waves are modulated through
   coupling to a single acoustic oscillation and through four-wave mixing.
   Starting from a single pump field, we observe the emergence of a comb of
   frequencies as the intensity is increased. The set of three differential
   equations derived here is sufficient to describe the generation of any
   number of Brillouin sidebands in oscillator systems that would have
   required hundreds of coupled equations in the standard approach. We test
   this approach on some published experiments and find excellent agreement
   with the results.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{To date, research on metasurfaces has predominantly focused on those
   with polarizabilities that are tangent to the metasurface. Only a few
   theoretical works have characterized metasurfaces with normal
   polarizabilities. Here, we provide full analytical, numerical, and
   experimental characterizations of a metasurface that can be described
   with polarizabilities in all three spatial directions. First, a set of
   equations is derived that allows a surface distribution of scatterers to
   be replaced by a sheet boundary condition. It is shown that the
   extraction of unknown polarizabilities in the normal direction
   necessarily requires scattering parameters obtained from oblique
   incidence. Closed-form expressions that relate scattering parameters to
   surface susceptibilities in all three spatial directions are given. It
   is shown that the reflection and transmission properties of the
   metasurface can be predicted, for an arbitrary angle of incidence, from
   the sheet parameters. In addition, we report the experimental
   characterization of a metasurface with polarizabilities in the normal
   direction. The free-space measurements were performed on a recently
   proposed DB metasurface at 10 GHz. Experiments confirmed that the sheet
   parameters do not change with angle of incidence. Consequently, it was
   possible to extract surface susceptibilities in the normal direction
   from measured transmission parameters alone.}},

Title = {{Ultrasound modulates ion channel currents}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Transcranial focused ultrasound (US) has been demonstrated to stimulate
   neurons in animals and humans, but the mechanism of this effect is
   unknown. It has been hypothesized that US, a mechanical stimulus, may
   mediate cellular discharge by activating mechanosensitive ion channels
   embedded within cellular membranes. To test this hypothesis, we
   expressed potassium and sodium mechanosensitive ion channels (channels
   of the two-pore-domain potassium family (K2P) including TREK-1, TREK-2,
   TRAAK; Na(V)1.5) in the Xenopus oocyte system. Focused US (10 MHz,
   0.3-4.9 W/cm(2)) modulated the currents flowing through the ion channels
   on average by up to 23\%, depending on channel and stimulus intensity.
   The effects were reversible upon repeated stimulation and were abolished
   when a channel blocker (ranolazine to block Na(V)1.5, BaCl2 to block K2P
   channels) was applied to the solution. These data reveal at the single
   cell level that focused US modulates the activity of specific ion
   channels to mediate transmembrane currents. These findings open doors to
   investigations of the effects of US on ion channels expressed in
   neurons, retinal cells, or cardiac cells, which may lead to important
   medical applications. The findings may also pave the way to the
   development of sonogenetics: a non-invasive, US-based analogue of
   optogenetics.}},

   three-coordinated lattices with the same standard deviation in the

Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{We present nanosecond time-scale Vlasov-Fokker-Planck-Maxwell modeling
   of magnetized plasma transport and dynamics in a hohlraum with an
   applied external magnetic field, under conditions similar to recent
   experiments. Self-consistent modeling of the kinetic electron momentum
   equation allows for a complete treatment of the heat flow equation and
   Ohm's law, including Nernst advection of magnetic fields. In addition to
   showing the prevalence of nonlocal behavior, we demonstrate that effects
   such as anomalous heat flow are induced by inverse bremsstrahlung
   heating. We show magnetic field amplification up to a factor of 3 from
   Nernst compression into the hohlraum wall. The magnetic field is also
   expelled towards the hohlraum axis due to Nernst advection faster than
   frozen-in flux would suggest. Nonlocality contributes to the heat flow
   towards the hohlraum axis and results in an augmented Nernst advection
   mechanism that is included self-consistently through kinetic modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the polarization of light with efficient and ultra-thin
   devices is desirable for a myriad of optical systems. Bianisotropic
   metasurfaces offer a promising alternative to conventional optical
   components due to their ability to provide extreme wavefront and
   polarization control within a low profile. However, metasurfaces have
   typically suffered from poor efficiencies and extinction ratios due to
   the lack of systematic design procedures. Here, the first, to the best
   of our knowledge, impedance-matched polarization rotator with a
   subwavelength thickness that operates at optical frequencies is
   reported. The bianisotropic response needed for polarization rotation is
   systematically designed using cascaded plasmonic sheets. The metasurface
   is fabricated using straightforward nanolithography processes.
   Measurements demonstrate an efficiency of 45\% and extinction ratio of
   115 (20.6 dB) at the operating wavelength of 1.56 mu m. This work
   experimentally demonstrates that a wide range of near-optimal
   bianisotropic responses can be designed and fabricated at optical
   frequencies. In the future, these surfaces could be utilized to develop
   high-performance, ultra-compact optical systems. (C) 2016 Optical

Title = {{Fast Flexible Transistors with a Nanotrench Structure}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{The simplification of fabrication processes that can define very fine
   patterns for large-area flexible radio-frequency (RF) applications is
   very desirable because it is generally very challenging to realize
   submicron scale patterns on flexible substrates. Conventional nanoscale
   patterning methods, such as e-beam lithography, cannot be easily applied
   to such applications. On the other hand, recent advances in
   nanoimprinting lithography (NIL) may enable the fabrication of
   large-area nanoelectronics, especially flexible RF electronics with
   finely defined patterns, thereby significantly broadening RF
   applications. Here we report a generic strategy for fabricating
   high-performance flexible Si nanomembrane (NM)-based RF thin-film
   transistors (TFTs), capable of over 100 GHz operation in theory, with
   NIL patterned deep-submicron-scale channel lengths. A unique
   3-dimensional etched-trench-channel configuration was used to allow for
   TFT fabrication compatible with flexible substrates. Optimal device
   parameters were obtained through device simulation to understand the
   underlying device physics and to enhance device controllability.
   Experimentally, a record-breaking 38 GHz maximum oscillation frequency
   f(max) value has been successfully demonstrated from TFTs with a 2 mu m
   gate length built with flexible Si NM on plastic substrates.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Respiratory tract infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are
   increasing in prevalence and are a significant cause of lung function
   decline in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). NTM have been detected
   in culture-independent analyses of CF airway microbiota at lower rates
   than would be expected based on published prevalence data, likely due to
   poor lysing of the NTM cell wall during DNA extraction. We compared a
   standard bacterial lysis protocol with a modified method by measuring
   NTM DNA extraction by qPCR and NTM detection with bacterial 16S rRNA
   gene sequencing. The modified method improved NTM DNA recovery from
   spiked CF sputum samples by a mean of 0.53 log10 copies/mL for M.
   abscessus complex and by a mean of 0.43 log10 copies/mL for M. avium
   complex as measured by qPCR targeting the atpE gene. The modified method
   also improved DNA sequence based NTM detection in NTM culture-positive
   CF sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples; however, both qPCR and 16S
   rRNA gene sequencing remained less sensitive than culture for NTM
   detection. We highlight the limitations of culture-independent
   identification of NTM from CF respiratory samples, and illustrate how
   alterations in the bacterial lysis and DNA extraction process can be
   employed to improve NTM detection with both qPCR and 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing.}},

   Imaging}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{Weapons-grade uranium and plutonium could be used as nuclear explosives
   with extreme destructive potential. The problem of their detection,
   especially in standard cargo containers during transit, has been
   described as ``searching for a needle in a haystack{''} because of the
   inherently low rate of spontaneous emission of characteristic
   penetrating radiation and the ease of its shielding. Currently, the only
   practical approach for uncovering well-shielded special nuclear
   materials is by use of active interrogation using an external radiation
   source. However, the similarity of these materials to shielding and the
   required radiation doses that may exceed regulatory limits prevent this
   method from being widely used in practice. We introduce a low-dose
   active detection technique, referred to as low-energy nuclear reaction
   imaging, which exploits the physics of interactions of multi-MeV
   monoenergetic photons and neutrons to simultaneously measure the
   material's areal density and effective atomic number, while confirming
   the presence of fissionable materials by observing the beta-delayed
   neutron emission. For the first time, we demonstrate identification and
   imaging of uranium with this novel technique using a simple yet robust
   source, setting the stage for its wide adoption in security
   applications.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{367-379}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{We report on a first-principles and experimental study of precipitation
   in supersaturated solid solutions of Mg-rich Mg-Nd alloys. A cluster
   expansion Hamiltonian combined with Monte Carlo simulations was used to
   calculate a metastable HCP temperature-composition phase diagram. Aging
   studies were performed on dilute Mg-Nd alloys that were then
   characterized with HAADF-STEM. The early stage decomposition of these
   alloys is dominated by the thermodynamic stability of different Nd
   orderings on the HCP crystal structure. The observed progression of
   Guinier-Preston zones can be rationalized by a successive reduction of
   the Nd chemical potential. HAADF-STEM studies confirm the appearance of
   beta'-like precipitates, however, the observed Nd ordering does not
   exclusively consist of zig-zag Nd rows but also contains linear strips
   of Nd-hexagons at non-periodic intervals. First-principles calculations
   predict that these orderings are stable compounds that belong to a
   family of hybrid phases formed by combining the beta' ordering with the
   hexagons of (beta `' (D0(19)) along the {[}010](beta') direction. We
   label this hierarchy of orderings as beta `''. A high degree of
   degeneracy among the different beta `'' phases is predicted. This along
   with a strong composition dependence of the misfit strain is likely
   responsible for the observed disorder of Nd-hexagon strips. Our
   experimental and first -principles evidence does not support the
   formation of Mg-3 Nd having D0(19) ordering. Rather, the features
   reported as D0(19) are isolated hexagonal GP rods that show no
   long-range periodicity. Our study suggests the following precipitation
   sequence for binary Mg-Nd alloys: SSSS -> GP Zones(N, V, hexagons) ->
   beta `'' -> beta(1) (Mg3Nd) -> beta(Mg12Nd) -> beta(e)(Mg-41 Nd-5). (C)

Title = {{Emissions impacts of using energy storage for power system reserves}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{444-456}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Energy storage devices, such as batteries and flywheels, are promising
   options for providing operating reserves due to their fast response and
   low emissions during operation. However, because of the complex nature
   of power systems, adding energy storage-based reserves to the power
   system may not necessarily benefit the environment. In this paper, we
   analyze these impacts in a test system and identify important drivers
   that affect the environmental outcomes. Dispatch results are obtained by
   solving an optimal power flow (OPF) problem and are used to determine
   emissions. We find that the impacts of adding energy storage are highly
   case-dependent. In systems with high renewable penetration levels and
   significant renewable curtailment, adding energy storage reduces
   emissions; in other systems, the impacts on emissions could be positive,
   neutral, or negative. The analyses presented in this paper show that
   policies to procure energy storage as a means to reduce emissions may
   actually lead to increased system-wide emissions if current dispatch
   algorithms are used. We also explore the impacts of modifying the
   dispatch algorithm to ensure system emissions with energy storage are no
   worse than system emissions without energy storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{A Network of Splice Isoforms for the Mouse}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The laboratory mouse is the primary mammalian species used for studying
   alternative splicing events. Recent studies have generated computational
   models to predict functions for splice isoforms in the mouse. However,
   the functional relationship network, describing the probability of
   splice isoforms participating in the same biological process or pathway,
   has not yet been studied in the mouse. Here we describe a rich
   genome-wide resource of mouse networks at the isoform level, which was
   generated using a unique framework that was originally developed to
   infer isoform functions. This network was built through integrating
   heterogeneous genomic and protein data, including RNA-seq, exon array,
   protein docking and pseudo-amino acid composition. Through simulation
   and cross-validation studies, we demonstrated the accuracy of the
   algorithm in predicting isoform-level functional relationships. We
   showed that this network enables the users to reveal functional
   differences of the isoforms of the same gene, as illustrated by
   literature evidence with Anxa6 (annexin a6) as an example. We expect
   this work will become a useful resource for the mouse genetics community
   to understand gene functions. The network is publicly available at:
   http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/isoformnetwork.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a vinegar-amended anaerobic biosand filter was
   evaluated for future application as point-of-use water treatment in
   rural areas for the removal of arsenic and nitrate from groundwater
   containing common ions. Due to the importance of sulfate and iron in
   arsenic removal and their variable concentrations in groundwater,
   influent sulfate and iron concentrations were varied. Complete removal
   of influent nitrate (50 mg/L) and over 50\% removal of influent arsenic
   (200 mu g/L) occurred. Of all conditions tested, the lowest median
   effluent arsenic concentration was 88 mu g/L. Iron removal occurred
   completely when 4 mg/L was added, and sulfate concentrations were
   lowered to a median concentration <2 mg/L from influent concentrations
   of 22 and 50 mg/L. Despite iron and sulfate removal and the
   establishment of reducing conditions, arsenic concentrations remained
   above the World Health Organization's arsenic drinking water standard.
   Further research is necessary to determine if anaerobic biosand filters
   can be improved to meet the arsenic drinking water standard and to
   evaluate practical implementation challenges. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Large-scale Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Zr alloys rods were fabricated by spray
   deposition. Microstructure observations reveal that equiaxed grains
   formed in the ingots, and the grain size in spray-deposited ingot was
   smaller than of the commercial product. High product of
   strength-elongation (11.9 GPa .\%.) alloy was obtained through spray
   deposition and followed by hot extrusion and solution treatment. This
   resulted in a good combination of strength and elongation (Ultimate
   tensile strength: 684 MPa; Elongation: 17.4\%). Hot extrusion improved
   the mechanical properties, while T6 treatment improved the tensile
   strength but decreased the elongation. The high-density nano-scale
   precipitates (eta' and Al3Zr precipitates) caused the improved strength
   (723 MPa), but were detrimental to the specimens' ductility (11\%).
   Intergranular fracture and transgranular fracture are main fracture
   mechanisms in extrusion state and T6 treatment samples, respectively.

   optically thin atom and positive ion emission from low density (less
   than or similar to 10(13) cm(-3)) plasmas from x-ray to infrared
   wavelengths. A key feature is that the data are assessed and regularly
   updated, with version 8 released in 2015. Atomic data for modeling the
   emissivities of 246 ions and neutrals are contained in CHIANTI, together
   with data for deriving the ionization fractions of all elements up to
   zinc. The different types of atomic data are summarized here and their
   formats discussed. Statistics on the impact of CHIANTI to the

Abstract = {{We develop a microstructure-based model to characterize and model
   failure initiation in DP steels using an extended finite element method
   (XFEM) to simulate martensite cracking on the mesoscale combined with
   representative volume element (RVE) modeling. A mini tensile test with
   digital image correlation (DIC) analysis is linked to local SEM analysis
   to identify the local strain at which failure is initiated. In-situ
   bending tests in SEM with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
   measurements before and after the test are carried out to validate that
   the crack initiates in the martensite islands. Empirical equations for
   XFEM parameters as functions of local carbon content in martensite are
   fit to experimental results for laboratory-annealed DP600 steels with
   varying martensite content. The equations are then shown to predict
   successfully failure initiation in industrially produced DP steels with
   various chemistries, strengths and martensite fractions. (C) 2016

Title = {{A Reduced-Order Model for Evaluating the Dynamic Response of Multilayer
   Plates to Impulsive Loads}},
Journal = {{SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PASSENGER CARS-MECHANICAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{83-89}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Assessing the dynamic performance of multilayer plates subjected to
   impulsive loading is of interest for identifying configurations that
   either absorb energy or transmit the energy in the transverse
   directions, thereby mitigating the through-thickness energy propagation.
   A reduced-order modeling approach is presented in this paper for rapidly
   evaluating the structural dynamic performance of various multilayer
   plate designs. The new approach is based on the reverberation matrix
   method (RMM) with the theory of generalized rays for fast analysis of
   the structural dynamic characteristics of multilayer plates. In the RMM
   model, the waves radiated from the dynamic load are reflected and
   refracted at each interface between layers, and the waves within each
   layer are transmitted with a phase lag. These two phenomena are
   represented by the global scattering matrix and the global phase matrix,
   respectively. The product of these two matrices after some mathematical
   manipulations provides a reverberation matrix that represents the waves
   within the entire plate. The dynamic response of the plate is calculated
   by employing the generalized ray theory and an inverse Fourier
   Transformation. Free response results obtained by the new approach are
   shown to have good agreement with those obtained by a spectral finite
   element analysis. Then, different multilayer plate design configurations
   are ranked by evaluating the dynamic response with the new reduced-order
   model. These forced response results are validated successfully by
   comparison to the ranking obtained through much more computationally
   expensive finite element analysis results.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most
   effective treatments for chronic low back pain. However, only half of
   Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients have access to trained CBT
   therapists, and program expansion is costly. CBT typically consists of
   10 weekly hour-long sessions. However, some patients improve after the
   first few sessions while others need more extensive contact.
   Objective: We are applying principles from ``reinforcement learning{''}
   (a field of artificial intelligence or AI) to develop an evidence-based,
   personalized CBT pain management service that automatically adapts to
   each patient's unique and changing needs (AI-CBT). AI-CBT uses feedback
   from patients about their progress in pain-related functioning measured
   daily via pedometer step counts to automatically personalize the
   intensity and type of patient support. The specific aims of the study
   are to (1) demonstrate that AI-CBT has pain-related outcomes equivalent
   to standard telephone CBT, (2) document that AI-CBT achieves these
   outcomes with more efficient use of clinician resources, and (3)
   demonstrate the intervention's impact on proximal outcomes associated
   with treatment response, including program engagement, pain management
   skill acquisition, and patients' likelihood of dropout.
   Methods: In total, 320 patients with chronic low back pain will be
   recruited from 2 VA healthcare systems and randomized to a standard 10
   sessions of telephone CBT versus AI-CBT. All patients will begin with
   weekly hour-long telephone counseling, but for patients in the AI-CBT
   group, those who demonstrate a significant treatment response will be
   stepped down through less resource-intensive alternatives including: (1)
   15-minute contacts with a therapist, and (2) CBT clinician feedback
   provided via interactive voice response calls (IVR). The AI engine will
   learn what works best in terms of patients' personally tailored
   treatment plans based on daily feedback via IVR about their
   pedometer-measured step counts, CBT skill practice, and physical
   functioning. Outcomes will be measured at 3 and 6 months post
   recruitment and will include pain-related interference, treatment
   satisfaction, and treatment dropout. Our primary hypothesis is that
   AI-CBT will result in pain-related functional outcomes that are at least
   as good as the standard approach, and that by scaling back the intensity
   of contact that is not associated with additional gains in pain control,
   the AI-CBT approach will be significantly less costly in terms of
   therapy time.
   Results: The trial is currently in the start-up phase. Patient
   enrollment will begin in the fall of 2016 and results of the trial will
   be available in the winter of 2019.
   Conclusions: This study will evaluate an intervention that increases
   patients' access to effective CBT pain management services while
   allowing health systems to maximize program expansion given constrained
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently developed a simple, reusable and coupled whole-cell
   biocatalytic system with the capability of cofactor regeneration and
   biocatalyst immobilization for improved production yield and sustained
   synthesis. Described herewith is the experimental procedure for the
   development of such a system consisting of two E. coli strains that
   express functionally complementary enzymes. Together, these two enzymes
   can function co-operatively to mediate the regeneration of expensive
   cofactors for improving the product yield of the bioreaction. In
   addition, the method of synthesizing an immobilized form of the coupled
   biocatalytic system by encapsulation of whole cells in calcium alginate
   beads is reported. As an example, we present the improved biosynthesis
   of L-xylulose from L-arabinitol by coupling E. coli cells expressing the
   enzymes L-arabinitol dehydrogenase or NADH oxidase. Under optimal
   conditions and using an initial concentration of 150 mM L-arabinitol,
   the maximal L-xylulose yield reached 96\%, which is higher than those
   reported in the literature. The immobilized form of the coupled
   whole-cell biocatalysts demonstrated good operational stability,
   maintaining 65\% of the yield obtained in the first cycle after 7 cycles
   of successive re-use, while the free cell system almost completely lost
   the catalytic activity. Therefore, the methods reported here provides
   two strategies that could help improve the industrial production of
   L-xylulose, as well as other value-added compounds requiring the use of
   cofactors in general.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetospheric cusps are important sites of the coupling of a
   magnetosphere with the solar wind. The combination of both ground-and
   space-based observations at Earth has enabled considerable progress to
   be made in understanding the terrestrial cusp and its role in the
   coupling of the magnetosphere to the solar wind via the polar
   magnetosphere. Voyager 2 fully explored Neptune's cusp in 1989, but
   highly inclined orbits of the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn present the
   most recent opportunity to repeatedly study the polarmagnetosphere of a
   rapidly rotating planet. In this paper we discuss observations made by
   Cassini during two passes through Saturn's southern polar magnetosphere.
   Our main findings are that (i) Cassini directly encounters the southern
   polar cusp with evidence for the entry of magnetosheath plasma into the
   cusp via magnetopause reconnection, (ii) magnetopause reconnection and
   entry of plasma into the cusp can occur over a range of solar wind
   conditions, and (iii) double cusp morphologies are consistent with the
   position of the cusp oscillating in phase with Saturn's global
   magnetospheric periodicities.}},

Title = {{Martian high-altitude photoelectrons independent of solar zenith angle}},

Abstract = {{Many aspects of the Martian upper atmosphere are known to vary with
   solar zenith angle (SZA). One would assume that dayside photoelectron
   fluxes are also SZA dependent, especially when transport along a
   semivertical magnetic field line is significant. However, our
   investigation presented here of the observed Martian high-altitude
   (similar to 400 km) photoelectron fluxes by the magnetometer/electron
   reflectometer (MAG/ER) instruments on board Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)
   shows that the photoelectron fluxes are better correlated with just the
   solar irradiance, without SZA factored in, and also that the median
   photoelectron fluxes are independent of SZA, especially for high
   energies (above 100 eV). For lower energies (below 70 eV), the observed
   fluxes tend to vary to some degree with SZA. Such counterintuitive
   results are due to the existence of a photoelectron exobase, only above
   which the photoelectrons are able to transport and escape to high
   altitudes. Two methods are used here to determine the altitude range of
   this exobase, which varies between 145 km and 165 km depending on the
   atmosphere and SZA. Through our SuperThermal Electron Transport (STET)
   model, we found that the integral of the production rate above the
   photoelectron exobase, and therefore the high-altitude photoelectron
   fluxes, is rather independent of SZA. Such an independent relationship
   concerns energy redistribution in the Martian upper atmosphere, using
   photoelectrons to map magnetic topology and connectivity, as well as ion
   escape. This finding can also be carefully adapted to other solar bodies
   with semivertical magnetic fields at ionospheric altitudes, such as
   Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated 7 years worth of data from the electron reflectometer
   and magnetometer aboard Mars Global Surveyor to quantify the deposition
   of photoelectron and solar wind electron populations on the nightside of
   Mars, over the strong crustal field region located in the southern
   hemisphere. Just under 600,000 observations, each including energy and
   pitch angle distributions, were examined. For solar zenith angles (SZA)
   less than 110 degrees, photoelectrons have the highest occurrence rate;
   beyond that, plasma voids occur most often. In addition, for SZA > 110
   degrees, energy deposition of electrons mainly occurs on vertical field
   lines with median pitch angle averaged energy flux values on the order
   of 10(7) - 10(8) eV cm(-2) s(-1). The fraction of downward flux that is
   deposited at a given location was typically low (16\% or smaller),
   implying that the majority of precipitated electrons are magnetically
   reflected or scattered back out. The average energy of the deposited
   electrons is found to be 20-30 eV, comparable to typical energies of
   photoelectrons and unaccelerated solar wind electrons. Median electron
   flux values, from near-vertical magnetic field lines past solar zenith
   angle of 110 degrees, calculated in this study produced a total electron
   content of 4.2 x10(14) m(-2) and a corresponding peak density of
   4.2x10(3) cm(-3).}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of determining the capacity to assign to each
   arc in a given network, subject to uncertainty in the supply and/or
   demand of each node. This design problem underlies many real-world
   applications, such as the design of power transmission and
   telecommunications networks. We first consider the case where a set of
   supply/demand scenarios are provided, and we must determine the
   minimum-cost set of arc capacities such that a feasible flow exists for
   each scenario. We briefly review existing theoretical approaches to
   solving this problem and explore implementation strategies to reduce run
   times. With this as a foundation, our primary focus is on a
   chance-constrained version of the problem in which alpha\% of the
   scenarios must be feasible under the chosen capacity, where a is a
   user-defined parameter and the specific scenarios to be satisfied are
   not predetermined. We describe an algorithm which utilizes a separation
   routine for identifying violated cut-sets which can solve the problem to
   optimality, and we present computational results. We also present a
   novel greedy algorithm, our primary contribution, which can be used to
   solve for a high quality heuristic solution. We present computational
   analysis to evaluate the performance of our proposed approaches. (C)

Title = {{Using field inversion to quantify functional errors in turbulence

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A data-informed approach is presented with the objective of quantifying
   errors and uncertainties in the functional forms of turbulence closure
   models. The approach creates modeling information from higher-fidelity
   simulations and experimental data. Specifically, a Bayesian formalism is
   adopted to infer discrepancies in the source terms of transport
   equations. A key enabling idea is the transformation of the functional
   inversion procedure (which is inherently infinite-dimensional) into a
   finite-dimensional problem in which the distribution of the unknown
   function is estimated at discrete mesh locations in the computational
   domain. This allows for the use of an efficient adjoint-driven inversion
   procedure. The output of the inversion is a full-field of discrepancy
   that provides hitherto inaccessible modeling information. The utility of
   the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a number of problems
   including channel flow, shock-boundary layer interactions, and flows
   with curvature and separation. In all these cases, the posterior model
   correlates well with the data. Furthermore, it is shown that even if
   limited data (such as surface pressures) are used, the accuracy of the
   inferred solution is improved over the entire computational domain. The
   results suggest that, by directly addressing the connection between
   physical data and model discrepancies, the field inversion approach
   materially enhances the value of computational and experimental data for
   model improvement. The resulting information can be used by the modeler
   as a guiding tool to design more accurate model forms, or serve as input
   to machine learning algorithms to directly replace deficient modeling
   terms. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is focused on the development of an efficient
   reliability-based design optimization algorithm for solving problems
   posed on uncertain linear dynamic systems characterized by large design
   variable vectors and driven by non-stationary stochastic excitation. The
   interest in such problems lies in the desire to define a new generation
   of tools that can efficiently solve practical problems, such as the
   design of high-rise buildings in seismic zones, characterized by
   numerous free parameters in a rigorously probabilistic setting. To this
   end a novel decoupling approach is developed based on defining and
   solving a limited sequence of deterministic optimization sub-problems.
   In particular, each sub-problem is formulated from information
   pertaining to a single simulation carried out exclusively in the current
   design point. This characteristic drastically limits the number of
   simulations necessary to find a solution to the original problem while
   making the proposed approach practically insensitive to the size of the
   design variable vector. To demonstrate the efficiency and strong
   convergence properties of the proposed approach, the structural system
   of a high-rise building defined by over three hundred free parameters is
   optimized under non-stationary stochastic earthquake excitation. (C)

Title = {{Computational and Empirical Studies Predict Mycobacterium

Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Identifying biomarkers for tuberculosis (TB) is an ongoing challenge in
   developing immunological correlates of infection outcome and protection.
   Biomarker discovery is also necessary for aiding design and testing of
   new treatments and vaccines. To effectively predict biomarkers for
   infection progression in any disease, including TB, large amounts of
   experimental data are required to reach statistical power and make
   accurate predictions. We took a two-pronged approach using both
   experimental and computational modeling to address this problem. We
   first collected 200 blood samples over a 2-year period from 28 non-human
   primates (NHP) infected with a low dose of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
   We identified T cells and the cytokines that they were producing (single
   and multiple) from each sample along with monkey status and infection
   progression data. Machine learning techniques were used to interrogate
   the experimental NHP datasets without identifying any potential TB
   biomarker. In parallel, we used our extensive novel NHP datasets to
   build and calibrate a multi-organ computational model that combines what
   is occurring at the site of infection (e.g., lung) at a single granuloma
   scale with blood level readouts that can be tracked in monkeys and
   humans. We then generated a large in silico repository of in silico
   granulomas coupled to lymph node and blood dynamics and developed an in
   silico tool to scale granuloma level results to a full host scale to
   identify what best predicts Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection
   outcomes. The analysis of in silico blood measures identifies
   Mtb-specific frequencies of effector T cell phenotypes at various time
   points post infection as promising indicators of infection outcome. We
   emphasize that pairing wetlab and computational approaches holds great
   promise to accelerate TB biomarker discovery.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic fields generated by a current flowing through a U-shaped coil
   connecting two copper foils were measured using ultrafast proton
   radiography. Two similar to 1.25 kJ, 1-ns laser pulses propagated
   through laser entrance holes in the front foil and were focused to the
   back foil with an intensity of similar to 3 x 10(16) W/cm(2). The
   intense laser-solid interaction induced a high voltage between the
   copper foils and generated a large current in the connecting coil. The
   proton data show similar to 40-50 T magnetic fields at the center of the
   coil similar to 3-4 ns after laser irradiation. The experiments provide
   significant insight for future target designs that aim to develop a
   powerful source of external magnetic fields for various applications in

Abstract = {{We show evidence of thickness-dependent elastic mechanical moduli that

   decreasing film thickness, h, for h less than a threshold film
   thickness, h(th). For SPS with f <= 64 and M-w(arm) > 9 kg/mol, the
   dependencies of E(h) on h were virtually identical for the linear
   chains. Notably, however, for SPS with f = 64 and M-w(arm) = 9 kg/mol
   (SPS-9k-64), the h(th) was over 50\% larger than that of the other

Abstract = {{The energy transport in a vegetated (corn) surface layer is examined by
   solving the vector radiative transfer equation using a numerical
   iterative approach. This approach allows a higher order that includes
   the multiple scattering effects. Multiple scattering effects are
   important when the optical thickness and scattering albedo of the
   vegetation layer are large. When both the albedo and the optical
   thickness exceed 0.4, higher orders contribute significantly (e.g.,
   vertical polarization at L-band). The approach is applied to vegetated
   surfaces using typical crop structure for backscattering from L-band to
   Ku-band. For corn fields at L-band, multiple scattering effects are more
   important for vertical scattered wave with vertical incidence (VV). For
   example, when vegetation water content (VWC) is 3kg/m(2), the deviation
   between first order and multiple scattering for corn field for VV could
   be 3.5 dB while 0.7 dB for horizontal scattered wave with horizontal
   incidence (HH). The iterative approach also allows the separation of the
   contribution to backscattering from each scattering order and scattering
   mechanism. Each scattering mechanism is associated with a unique
   scattering path. By examining the duality of the paths, we are able to
   identify the cyclical terms with existence of a reflective boundary. The
   cyclical correction to the backscattering accounts for backscattering
   enhancement effects on the copolarization by a factor of two. The
   approach is validated against the SMAPVEX12 L-band corn dataset over the
   entire crop growth and large soil moisture variations. The model
   prediction matches the observation with 1.93 and 1.46 dB
   root-mean-square error (RMSE) for VV and HH, respectively, while
   correlations are 0.67 and 0.88, respectively. Time-series retrieval is
   also applied successfully for both soil moisture and VWC with 0.06
   cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.44 kg/m(2) RMSE, respectively, while correlations are
   0.7 and 0.92, respectively. For large VWC, this approach corrects the
   underestimated backscatters in the single scattering caused by large
   attenuation.}},

Abstract = {{Production Lead Time (LT) is the average time a part spends in the
   system, being processed or waiting for processing. In systems with
   unlimited buffers, LT may be orders of magnitude larger than the total
   processing time, leading to serious economic and quality problems. At
   present, no systematic analytical methods for evaluation, analysis, and
   control of LT in systems with machines having up- and downtime
   characterized by continuous random variables are available. This paper
   is intended to develop such methods. Specifically, we address
   synchronous serial lines with exponential machines and derive formulas
   for LT as a function of machine parameters and raw material release
   rate. Using these formulas, we develop methods for open- and closed-loop
   raw material release, which result in the desired LT. For asynchronous
   exponential lines, we provide an upper bound on LT. For non-exponential
   lines (e.g., Weibull, gamma, and log-normal), we offer an empirical
   formula for LT as an affine function of the coefficient of variation.
   The results reported in this paper enable a new paradigm for production
   systems management, namely: manage a production system so that the
   desired LT is ensured, while the throughput is maximized.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops new adaptive learning methods for a dynamic system
   where the dependency among variables changes over time. In general, many
   statistical methods focus on characterizing a system or process with
   historical data and predicting future observations based on a developed
   time-invariant model. However, for a nonstationary process with
   time-varying input-to-output relationship, a single baseline curve may
   not accurately characterize the system's dynamic behavior. This study
   develops kernel-based nonparametric regression models that allow the
   baseline curve to evolve over time. Applying the proposed approach to a
   real wind power system, we investigate the nonstationary nature of wind
   effect on the turbine response. The results show that the proposed
   methods can dynamically update the time-varying dependency pattern and
   can track changes in the operational wind power system.}},

   function}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (RPNIs) are
   neurotized free autologous muscle grafts equipped with electrodes to
   record myoelectric signals for prosthesis control. Viability of rat RPNI
   constructs have been demonstrated using evoked responses. In vivo RPNI
   characterization is the next critical step for assessment as a control
   modality for prosthetic devices. Approach. Two RPNIs were created in
   each of two rats by grafting portions of free muscle to the ends of
   divided peripheral nerves (peroneal in the left and tibial in the right
   hind limb) and placing bipolar electrodes on the graft surface. After
   four months, we examined in vivo electromyographic signal activity and
   compared these signals to muscular electromyographic signals recorded
   from autologous muscles in two rats serving as controls. An additional
   group of two rats in which the autologous muscles were denervated served
   to quantify cross-talk in the electrode recordings. Recordings were made
   while rats walked on a treadmill and a motion capture system tracked the
   hind limbs. Amplitude and periodicity of signals relative to gait were
   quantified, con -elation between electromyographic and motion recording
   were assessed, and a decoder was trained to predict joint motion. Main
   Results. Raw RPNI signals were active during walking, with amplitudes of
   1 MVpp, and quiet during standing, with amplitudes less than 0.1 mVpp.
   RPNI signals were periodic and entrained with gait. A decoder predicted
   bilateral ankle motion with greater than 80\% reliability. Control group
   signal activity agreed with literature. Denervated group signals
   remained quiescent throughout all evaluations. Significance. In vivo
   myoelectric RPNI activity encodes neural activation patterns associated
   with gait. Signal contamination from muscles adjacent to the RPNI is
   minimal, as demonstrated by the low amplitude signals obtained from the
   Denervated group. The periodicity and entrainment to gait of RPNI
   recordings suggests the transduced signals were generated via central
   nervous system control.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the all-angle reflectionless property of transformation
   optics devices is analyzed, and a physical explanation is provided for
   it. To this end, plane wave propagation through a planar boundary
   separating two homogenous, lossless magnetically anisotropic media is
   studied. The general form of material parameters enabling an all-angle
   reflectionless transmission of electromagnetic waves through the
   boundary is derived. Similarities are drawn between this general form of
   all-angle reflectionless material parameters and those observed in
   transformation optics designs. The findings are verified through
   full-wave simulation. Furthermore, a physical explanation as to why the
   general form of anisotropic material parameters are reflectionless for
   all angle of incidences is provided. This work provides an intuitive
   understanding of the inherent reflectionless property of transformation
   optics devices, and may find applications in designing reflectionless
   media to control electromagnetic waves without the use of coordinate

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This is an exploratory investigation on the self-sensing capabilities of
   nano-enriched glass/fibre laminates for damage detection purposes
   through changes in the dynamic responses, which are estimated by
   measuring the changes in voltage due to a dynamic strain. The
   deformation of the nano-enriched structure introduces changes in the
   resistance/voltage of the nanocomposites. The measured voltage signals
   contain information of the vibratory response of the laminated beam.
   This research uses a vibration-based data driven methodology for damage
   detection applied for the estimated vibratory signals using the
   conductivity properties of the embedded nano-particles. The structure
   considered in this study is a glass/fibre laminated beam enriched with
   carbon black nanoparticles (CB). The structure is subjected to a direct
   electric current and the voltage signal is measured. The vibration based
   monitoring method used is generally based on singular spectrum analysis
   applied on the estimated vibratory response. The voltage response signal
   is divided into a certain number of principal components which contain
   the oscillatory components distributed by their content of variance in
   the voltage signal. The components with more variance are used to define
   a reference state based on the status of the healthy structure.
   Consequently, the estimated vibratory signals from beams with a
   simulated damage are compared to the healthy state which eventually
   results in the damage detection procedure. The damage was simulated
   firstly by adding an additional mass on the beam tip and secondly by
   drilling a hole on the beam tip. The results demonstrate the potential
   for using the voltage estimated vibratory signals for self-sensing
   damage detection purposes in carbon nano-enriched glass/fibre
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonic lithography, which utilizes subwavelength confinement of
   surface plasmon polartion (SPP) waves, has the capability of breaking
   the diffraction limit and delivering high resolution. However, all
   previously reported results suffer from critical issues, such as shallow
   pattern depth and pattern nonuniformity even over small exposure areas,
   which limit the application of the technology. In this work, periodic
   patterns with high aspect ratios and a half-pitch of about 1/6 of the
   wavelength were achieved with pattern uniformity in square centimeter
   areas. This was accomplished by designing a special mask and photoresist
   (PR) system to select a single high spatial frequency mode and
   incorporating the PR into a waveguide configuration to ensure uniform
   light exposure over the entire depth of the photoresist layer. In
   addition to the experimental progress toward large-scale applications of
   plasmonic interference lithography, the general criteria of designing
   such an exposure system is also discussed, which can be used for
   nanoscale fabrication in this fashion for various applications with
   different requirements for wavelength, pitch, aspect ratio, and

Abstract = {{Large-area nanostructures are widely used in various fields, but
   fabrication on large-area uneven substrates poses a significant
   challenge. This study demonstrates a step-controllable
   electric-field-assisted nanoimprint lithography (e-NIL) method that can
   achieve conformal contact with uneven substrates for high fidelity
   nanostructuring. Experiments are used to demonstrate the method where a
   substrate coated with liquid resist is brought into contact with a
   flexible template driven by the applied electric field. Theoretical
   analysis based on the elasticity theory and electro-hydrodynamic theory
   is carried out. Effective voltage range and the saturation voltage are
   also discussed. A step-controllable release of flexible template is
   proposed and demonstrated to ensure the continuous contact between the
   template and an uneven substrate. This prevents formation of air traps
   and allows large area conformal contact to be achieved. A combination of
   Vacuum-electric field assisted step-controllable e-NIL is implemented in
   the developed prototype. Finally, photonic crystal nanostructures are
   successfully fabricated on a 4 in., 158 mu m bow gallium nitride light
   emitting diode epitaxial wafer using the proposed method, which enhance

Abstract = {{We present a novel scheme for ultrabroadband and omnidirectional perfect
   absorbers with compact multilayer film structure. Our proposed device
   shows an average absorption of similar to 98\% over a wide range of
   wavelengths ranging from 400 to 2000 nm. The ultrabroadband
   characteristics are achieved with strongly overlapped optical resonances
   by designing a tandem structure composed of three absorptive materials,
   while the overall structure features a graded refractive index profile
   to obtain a wideband antireflection property. In addition to the high
   efficiency and ultrabroadband absorption, our perfect absorbers exhibit
   a great angular tolerance up to 60 degrees, which is attributed to not
   only relatively broad resonances but also negligible propagation phase
   shifts in ultrathin highly absorbing layers. Lastly, we explore the
   effect of the number of semiconductor-metal stacks on the performance of
   the absorber. The presented approach can have tremendous potential for
   various applications, such as solar-thermal energy harvesting,
   thermoelectrics, detection, and imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Natural imaging systems such as the retina and the compound eye employ a
   conformal architecture that provides an aberration-free image with wide
   field of view (FOV) and very low f/number. However, most artificial
   imagers such as conventional cameras are limited to a planar
   architecture demanded by the use of brittle semiconductor focal plane
   arrays (FPAs). High-resolution image formation on this flat field
   requires multiple bulky optical elements. Here we demonstrate a general
   approach to fabricating complex circuits and in particular FPAs on
   flexible and/or conformable substrates that can be shaped to overcome
   these fundamental limitations. An 8 x 100, lightweight, thin-film
   In0.53Ga0.47As p-i-n photodiode FPA with sensitivity to wavelengths as
   long as lambda = 1650 nm is fabricated on a thin flexible plastic foil
   following transfer by adhesive-free bonding of the epitaxial layers that
   are subsequently lifted off from the parent InP substrate. The array is
   shaped into either a convex cylindrically curved imager to achieve a 2
   pi FOV or, when formed into a concave shape, to provide high-resolution
   and compact spectral decomposition over a wide wavelength range. The
   array exhibits similar to 99\% fabrication yield with similar to 100\%
   peak external quantum efficiency at lambda = 1300 nm. The unique
   features of this flexible thin-film FPA provide a new paradigm for
   realizing advanced electronic and imaging applications.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Narrowband Power Line Communications (NB-PLCs) are investigated as an
   alternative option for transferring low rate smart grid (SG) data via
   Medium Voltage (MV) power lines. In this framework, two variants of
   orthogonal frequency division multiplexing are examined, namely
   Filtered-OFDM (F-OFDM) and Wavelet-OFDM (W-OFDM), in an attempt to
   determine which of them is capable of transmitting low rate SG data to
   greater distances over non-branched MV power lines. The reach of NB-PLC
   signals via MV power lines is estimated, taking into account the
   transfer function of the relevant PLC channels and noise mechanisms as
   well as the specific features of the two modulation options under
   consideration. Simulations show that NB-PLC transmission constitutes a
   technically feasible and economically affordable option for exchanging
   low rate data with remote SG nodes dispersed over the MV grid. Moreover,
   simulations show that F-OFDM allows low rate data transmission to
   considerably greater distances compared to W-OFDM.}},

Abstract = {{Digital PCR (dPCR) is gaining popularity as a DNA mutation
   quantification method for clinical specimens. Fragmentation prior to
   dPCR is required for non-fragmented genomic DNA samples; however, the
   effect of fragmentation on DNA analysis has not been well-studied. Here
   we evaluated three fragmentation methods for their effects on dPCR point
   mutation assay performance. Wild-type (WT) human genomic DNA was
   fragmented by heating, restriction digestion, or acoustic shearing using
   a Covaris focused-ultrasonicator. dPCR was then used to determine the
   limit of blank (LoB) by quantifying observed WT and mutant allele counts
   of the proto-oncogenes KRAS and BRAF in the WT DNA sample. DNA
   fragmentation by heating to 95 degrees C, while the simplest and least
   expensive method, produced a high background mutation frequency for
   certain KRAS mutations relative to the other methods. This was due to
   heat-induced mutations, specifically affecting dPCR assays designed to
   interrogate guanine to adenine (G>A) mutations. Moreover, heat-induced
   fragmentation overestimated gene copy number, potentially due to
   denaturation and partition of single-stranded DNA into different
   droplets. Covaris acoustic shearing and restriction enzyme digestion
   showed similar LoBs and gene copy number estimates to one another. It
   should be noted that moderate heating, commonly used in genomic DNA
   extraction protocols, did not significantly increase observed KRAS
   mutation counts.}},

Abstract = {{Existing work on pursuit-evasion problems typically either assumes
   stationary or heuristic behavior of one side and examines
   countermeasures of the other, or assumes both sides to be strategic
   which leads to a game theoretical framework. Results from the former
   often lack robustness against changes in the adversarial behavior, while
   those from the second category, typically as equilibrium solution
   concepts, may be difficult to justify: either due to the implied
   knowledge of other players' actions/beliefs and knowledge of their
   knowledge, or due to a lack of efficient dynamics to achieve such
   equilibria. In this paper, we take a different approach by assuming an
   intelligent pursuer/evader that is adaptive to the information available
   to it and is capable of learning over time with performance guarantee.
   Within this context we investigate two cases. In the first case we
   assume either the evader or the pursuer is aware of the type of learning
   algorithm used by the opponent, while in the second case neither side
   has such information and thus must try to learn. We show that the
   optimal policies in the first case have a greedy nature. This result is
   then used to assess the performance of the learning algorithms that both
   sides employ in the second case, which is shown to be mutually optimal
   and there is no loss for either side compared to the case when it knows
   perfectly the adaptive pattern used by the adversary and responses
   optimally. We further extend our model to study the application of
   jamming defense.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a switched-capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR) that dithers

   frequency, and the flying capacitance for different phases is adjusted
   according to load current change through comparators and a digital
   controller. The proposed technique is demonstrated in a 65 nm test chip
   consisting of a 40-phase SCVR with 4b capacitance modulation (CM) and a
   2: 1 conversion ratio. On-chip circuits for ripple measurement and load
   performance monitoring were included to accurately assess the magnitude
   and impact of ripple reduction. Measurement results show that at a 2.3 V
   input, an on-chip ripple magnitude of 6-16 mV at 1 V output is achieved
   for 11-142 mA load. Peak efficiency is 70.8\% at a power density of

Abstract = {{Conventional content addressable memory (BCAM and TCAM) uses specialized
   10T/16T bit cells that are significantly larger than 6T SRAM cells. A
   new BCAM/TCAM is proposed that can operate with standard push-rule 6T
   SRAM cells, reducing array area by 2-5x and allowing reconfiguration of
   the SRAM as a CAM. In this way, chip area and overall capacitance can be
   reduced, leading to higher energy efficiency for search operations. In
   addition, the configurable memory can perform bit-wise logical
   operations: ``AND{''} and ``NOR{''} on two or more words stored within
   the array. Thus, the configurable memory with CAM and logical function
   capability can be used to off-load specific computational operations to
   the memory, improving system performance and efficiency. Using a 6T 28
   nm FDSOI SRAM bit cell, the 64x64 (4 kb) BCAM achieves 370 MHz at 1 V

Abstract = {{This paper presents measurement results of a method by which the shapes
   of the output signals derived from a front end readout circuit can be
   made insensitive to the input detector capacitance, to a degree limited
   only by the accuracy with which one can make an amplifier with unity
   gain. A charge sensitive amplifier including the detector capacitance
   compensation technique was implemented in a standard 180-nm CMOS
   technology with a 3.3-V supply voltage. The results show that the
   technique can successfully mitigate the performance degradation that
   accompanies large detector capacitance derived from either large area
   radiation sensors and/or high permittivity materials, such as
   nanocrystalline assemblies. In order to verify the feasibility of the
   technique, we measured alpha particle spectra on two different sized
   silicon detectors that have detector capacitances of 1.26 pF and 21.84
   pF, derived from 2-mm- and 10-mm-diameter devices, respectively. A
   configuration for integrating the fabricated preamplifier with a
   detector is also described to exploit the technique for any other

Abstract = {{We report on the measurements of monoenergetic neutrons from DD and DT
   fusion reactions by use of the capture gating method in a heterogeneous
   plastic-glass composite scintillation detector. The cylindrical detector
   is 5.08 cm in diameter and 5.05 cm in height and was fabricated using
   1-mm diameter Li-doped glass rods (GS20) and scintillating polyvinyl
   toluene (EJ-290). Different scintillation decay constants are used to
   identify energy depositions in two materials constituting the composite
   scintillator. Geant4 simulations of the neutron thermalization and
   capture process were conducted, finding a mean capture time of
   approximately 2.6 mu s for both DD and DT neutrons. A capture gating
   time acceptance window based on simulation results was used to identify
   the neutron thermalization pulses. The total scintillation light yield
   produced in neutron thermalization was measured and found to show
   consistency on event-by-event basis despite the variety of neutron
   thermalization histories prior to capture. The ratio of light yields
   from thermalization of 14.1 MeV and 2.45 MeV neutrons in the EJ-290
   scintillator was determined to be 14.6, and the light output from 2.45
   MeV neutrons was also correlated to its electron equivalent, obtaining a
   value of 0.58 +/- 0.05 MeVee.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method for recovering linear controllability for
   the attitude of an underactuated spacecraft by accounting for the
   effects of solar radiation pressure in the spacecraft attitude model.
   The developments are based on a spacecraft model that has at least two
   functional reaction wheels. A solar radiation pressure torque model that
   is a function of spacecraft attitude is incorporated and, under suitable
   assumptions, can be simplified for spacecraft with body symmetry.
   Conditions are given under which a symmetric-body spacecraft will
   experience zero solar radiation pressure torque. The stability of the
   underactuated spacecraft model is discussed, and necessary and
   sufficient conditions are given for linear controllability to be
   regained when solar radiation pressure torques are included in the
   spacecraft attitude model. With linear controllability restored,
   conventional controllers can be designed for underactuated spacecraft.
   Controllability of a cuboid spacecraft under the influence of solar
   radiation pressure is then analyzed. Nonlinear simulations illustrate
   this novel approach to recover pointing by controlling two functioning
   reaction wheels while two other wheels undergo subsequent failures.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents fully sealed absolute capacitive pressure sensors
   for high-pressure applications in hydraulic environments. The sensors
   have a phi 100 mu m diaphragm and a nominal interelectrode gap of 3 mu
   m. The interiors of the cavities are electrically isolated, allowing the
   sensors to operate at the high end of the pressure range with the center
   of the diaphragm in contact with the substrate beneath it. The sensors
   are monolithically fabricated using a combination of surface
   micromachining and through-wafer isolated bulk-silicon lead transfer for
   backside contacts. This structure allows the device footprints to be
   reduced to about 150 x 150 mu m(2), and simplifies system integration.
   Fabricated sensors with diaphragm thicknesses of 3 mu m (C100t3) and 5
   mu m (C100t5) are tested in an oil environment at pressures up to 20 MPa
   and 50 MPa, respectively. The average sensitivities are 7200 ppm MPa-1
   (3.1 fF MPa-1) for C100t3, and 3400 ppm MPa-1 (1.6 fF MPa-1) for C100t5
   in the noncontact mode. In the contact mode, the average sensitivities
   are 9900 ppm MPa-1 (5.3 fF MPa-1) for C100t3, and 3100 ppm MPa-1 (1.6 fF
   MPa-1) for C100t5. A multiphysics finite element analysis approach that
   accommodates contact mode simulations is also presented.}},

Title = {{Three-Dimensional Force Measurements During Rapid Palatal Expansion in
   Sus scrofa}},
Journal = {{MICROMACHINES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Rapid palatal expansion is an orthodontic procedure widely used to
   correct the maxillary arch. However, its outcome is significantly
   influenced by factors that show a high degree of variability amongst
   patients. The traditional treatment methodology is based on an intuitive
   and heuristic treatment approach because the forces applied in the three
   dimensions are indeterminate. To enable optimal and individualized
   treatment, it is essential to measure the three-dimensional (3D) forces
   and displacements created by the expander. This paper proposes a method
   for performing these 3D measurements using a single embedded strain
   sensor, combining experimental measurements of strain in the palatal
   expander with 3D finite element analysis (FEA). The method is
   demonstrated using the maxillary jaw from a freshly euthanized pig (Sus
   scrofa) and a hyrax-design rapid palatal expander (RPE) appliance with
   integrated strain gage. The strain gage measurements are recorded using
   a computer interface, following which the expansion forces and extent of
   expansion are estimated by FEA. A total activation of 2.0 mm results in
   peak total force of about 100 N-almost entirely along the direction of
   expansion. The results also indicate that more than 85\% of the input
   activation is immediately transferred to the palate and/or teeth. These
   studies demonstrate a method for assessing and individualizing expansion
   magnitudes and forces during orthopedic expansion of the maxilla. This
   provides the basis for further development of smart orthodontic
   appliances that provide real-time readouts of forces and movements,
   which will allow personalized, optimal treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in sensor technologies have led to the instrumentation of
   sensor networks for bridge monitoring and management. For a dense sensor
   network, enormous amount of sensor data are collected. The data need to
   be managed, processed, and interpreted. Data management issues are of
   prime importance for a bridge management system. This paper describes a
   data management infrastructure for bridge monitoring applications.
   Specifically, NoSQL database systems such as MongoDB and Apache
   Cassandra are employed to handle time-series data as well the
   unstructured bridge information model data. Standard XML-based modeling
   languages such as OpenBrIM and SensorML are adopted to manage
   semantically meaningful data and to support interoperability. Data
   interoperability and integration among different components of a bridge
   monitoring system that includes on-site computers, a central server,
   local computing platforms, and mobile devices are illustrated. The data
   management framework is demonstrated using the data collected from the
   wireless sensor network installed on the Telegraph Road Bridge, Monroe,
   MI.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional direct simulation Monte-Carlo modeling of the coma of
   comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko observed by the VIRTIS and ROSINA
   instruments on board Rosetta}},

Abstract = {{Context. Since its rendezvous with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
   (67P), the Rosetta spacecraft has provided invaluable information
   contributing to our understanding of the cometary environment. On board,
   the VIRTIS and ROSINA instruments can both measure gas parameters in the
   rarefied cometary atmosphere, the so-called coma, and provide
   complementary results with remote sensing and in situ measurement
   techniques, respectively. The data from both ROSINA and VIRTIS
   instruments suggest that the source regions of H2O and CO2 are not
   uniformly distributed over the surface of the nucleus even after
   accounting for the changing solar illumination of the irregularly shaped
   rotating nucleus. The source regions of H2O and CO2 are also relatively
   different from one another.
   Aims. The use of a combination of a formal numerical data inversion
   method with a fully kinetic coma model is a way to correlate and
   interpret the information provided by these two instruments to fully
   understand the volatile environment and activity of comet 67P.
   Methods. In this work, the nonuniformity of the outgassing activity at
   the surface of the nucleus is described by spherical harmonics and
   constrained by ROSINA-DFMS data. This activity distribution is coupled
   with the local illumination to describe the inner boundary conditions of
   a 3D direct simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC) approach using the Adaptive
   Mesh Particle Simulator (AMPS) code applied to the H2O and CO2 coma of
   comet 67P.
   Results. We obtain activity distribution of H2O and CO2 showing a
   dominant source of H2O in the Hapi region, while more CO2 is produced in
   the southern hemisphere. The resulting model outputs are analyzed and
   compared with VIRTIS-M/-H and ROSINA-DFMS measurements, showing much
   better agreement between model and data than a simpler model assuming a
   uniform surface activity. The evolution of the H2O and CO2 production
   rates with heliocentric distance are derived accurately from the coma
   model showing agreement between the observations from the different
   instruments and ground-based observations.
   Conclusions. We derive the activity distributions for H2O and CO2 at the
   surface of the nucleus described in spherical harmonics, which we couple
   to the local solar illumination to constitute the boundary conditions of
   our coma model. The model presented reproduces the coma observations
   made by the ROSINA and VIRTIS instruments on board the Rosetta
   spacecraft showing our understanding of the physics of 67P's coma. This
   model can be used for further data analyses, such as dust modeling, in a
   future work.}},

Abstract = {{A combined experimental and analytical study to determine the
   configurations of transforming martensite during ambient temperature
   cyclic deformation of superelastic Nickel-Titanium has been conducted.
   Full-field, sub-grain-size microscale strain measurements were made in
   situ during cycling using distortion-corrected Digital Image Correlation
   combined with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-DIC). Using grain
   orientation maps from Electron Backscatter Diffraction analysis,
   possible configurations of martensite formed during cyclic deformation
   were identified by matching the calculated and measured strain fields.
   This analysis showed that the inclusion of Correspondence Variants (CVs)
   in addition to Habit Plane Variants (HPVs) of transformed martensite was
   necessary to provide a robust fit between calculated and measured strain
   fields. The approach also provided evidence that there was a more rapid
   accumulation of residual strain in CV regions and that a correlation
   existed between residual strain accumulation and the loss of actively
   transforming martensite in later cycles. It was also found that regions
   of CVs could coexist with untransformed austenite and Habit Plane
   Variants (HPVs) in individual grains throughout the microstructure, and
   that these regions of CVs formed before the end of the macroscopic
   stress plateau. The CV structure that forms during the initial
   superelastic deformation of Nickel-Titanium plays a critical role in
   shaping and stabilizing subsequent martensite recovery during cyclic
   loading. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AimsTo investigate the effect of instruction on activation of pelvic
   floor muscles (PFM) in men as quantified by transperineal ultrasound
   imaging (US) and to validate these measures with invasive EMG
   recordings.
   MethodsDisplacement of pelvic floor landmarks on transperineal US,
   intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) recorded with a nasogastric transducer,
   and surface EMG of the abdominal muscles and anal sphincter were
   recorded in 15 healthy men during sub-maximal PFM contractions in
   response to different verbal instructions: tighten around the anus,
   elevate the bladder, shorten the penis, and stop the flow of urine. In
   three men, fine-wire EMG recordings were made from puborectalis and
   bulbocavernosus, and trans-urethral EMG recordings from the striated
   urethral sphincter (SUS). Displacement data were validated by analysis
   of relationship with invasive EMG. Displacement, IAP, and abdominal/anal
   EMG were compared between instructions.
   ResultsDisplacement of pelvic landmarks correlated with the EMG of the
   muscles predicted anatomically to affect their locations. Greatest
   dorsal displacement of the mid-urethra and SUS activity was achieved
   with the instruction shorten the penis. Instruction to elevate the
   bladder induced the greatest increase in abdominal EMG and IAP. Tighten
   around the anus induced greatest anal sphincter activity.
   ConclusionsThe pattern of urethral movement measured from transperineal
   US is influenced by the instructions used to teach activation of the
   pelvic floor muscles in men. Efficacy of PFM training may depend on the
   instructions used to train activation. Instructions that optimize
   activation of muscles with a potential to increase urethral pressure
   without increasing abdominal EMG/IAP are likely ideal. Neurourol.

Abstract = {{Statistical image reconstruction (SIR) methods are studied extensively
   for X-ray computed tomography (CT) due to the potential of acquiring CT
   scans with reduced X-ray dose while maintaining image quality. However,
   the longer reconstruction time of SIR methods hinders their use in X-ray
   CT in practice. To accelerate statistical methods, many optimization
   techniques have been investigated. Over-relaxation is a common technique
   to speed up convergence of iterative algorithms. For instance, using a
   relaxation parameter that is close to two in alternating direction
   method of multipliers (ADMM) has been shown to speed up convergence
   significantly. This paper proposes a relaxed linearized augmented
   Lagrangian (AL) method that shows theoretical faster convergence rate
   with over-relaxation and applies the proposed relaxed linearized AL
   method to X-ray CT image reconstruction problems. Experimental results
   with both simulated and real CT scan data show that the proposed relaxed
   algorithm (with ordered-subsets {[}OS] acceleration) is about twice as
   fast as the existing unrelaxed fast algorithms, with negligible

Title = {{Semi-automated counting of axon regeneration in poly(lactide

Abstract = {{Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating event with
   multiple mechanisms of degeneration leading to life-long paralysis.
   Biomaterial strategies, including bridges that span the injury and
   provide a pathway to reconnect severed regions of the spinal cord, can
   promote partial restoration of motor function following SO. Axon growth
   through the bridge is essential to characterizing regeneration, as
   recovery can occur via other mechanisms such as plasticity. Quantitative
   analysis of axons by manual counting of histological sections can be
   slow, which can limit the number of bridge designs evaluated. In this
   study, we report a semi-automated process to resolve axon numbers in
   histological sections, which allows for efficient analysis of large data
   sets.
   New method: Axon numbers were estimated in SCI cross-sections from
   animals implanted with poly(lactide co-glycolide) (PLG) bridges with
   multiple channels for guiding axons. Immunofluorescence images of
   histological sections were filtered using a Hessian-based approach prior
   to threshold detection to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and filter
   out background staining associated with PLG polymer.
   Results: Semi-automated counting successfully recapitulated average axon
   densities and myelination in a blinded PLG bridge implantation study.
   Comparison with existing methods: Axon counts obtained with the
   semi-automated technique correlated well with manual axon counts from
   blinded independent observers across sections with a wide range of total
   axons.
   Conclusions: This semi-automated detection of Hessian-filtered axons
   provides an accurate and significantly faster alternative to manual
   counting of axons for quantitative analysis of regeneration following
   SCI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanotwins require little energy to form in metals, but their impact on
   strength and ductility is dramatic. New mechanisms of strengthening,
   strain hardening, ductility, and strainrate sensitivity have been
   observed in nanowires, films, and bulk materials containing nanoscale
   twins as the twin-boundary spacing decreases. These mechanisms can act
   in concert to produce interface-dominated nanomaterials with extreme
   tensile strength and plastic deformation without breaking. This article
   reviews recent theoretical and experimental understanding of the
   physical mechanisms of plasticity in nanotwin-strengthened metals, with
   a particular focus on the fundamental roles of coherent, incoherent, and
   defective twin boundaries in plastic deformation of bulk and small-scale
   cubic systems, and discusses new experimental methods for controlling
   these deformation mechanisms in nanotwinned metals and alloys.}},

Title = {{Accuracy of Clinical Techniques for Evaluating Lower Limb Sensorimotor
   Functions Associated With Increased Fall Risk}},
Journal = {{PM\&R}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Background: In prior work, laboratory-based measures of hip motor
   function and ankle proprioceptive precision were critical to maintaining
   unipedal stance and fall/fall-related injury risk. However, the optimal
   clinical evaluation techniques for predicting these measures are
   unknown.
   Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of common clinical
   maneuvers in predicting laboratory-based measures of frontal plane hip
   rate of torque development (Hip(RTD)) and ankle proprioceptive
   thresholds (Ank(PRO)) associated with increased fall risk.
   Design: Prospective, observational study.
   Setting: Biomechanical research laboratory.
   Participants: A total of 41 older subjects (aged 69.1 +/- 8.3 years), 25
   with varying degrees of diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy and 16
   without.
   Assessments: Clinical hip strength was evaluated by manual muscle
   testing (MMT) and lateral plank time, defined as the number of seconds
   that the laterally lying subject could lift the hips from the support
   surface. Foot/ankle evaluation included Achilles reflex and vibratory,
   proprioceptive, monofilament, and pinprick sensations at the great toe.
   Main Outcome Measures: Hip(RTD), abduction and adduction, using a custom
   whole-body dynamometer. Ank(PRO) determined with subjects standing using
   a foot cradle system and a staircase series of 100 frontal plane
   rotational stimuli.
   Results: Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and receiver operator
   characteristic (ROC) curves revealed that LPT correlated more strongly
   with Hip(RTD) (r/P = 0.61/<.001 and 0.67/<.001, for abductor/adductor,
   respectively) than did hip abductor MMT (r/P = 0.31/.044). Subjects with
   greater vibratory and proprioceptive sensation, and intact Achilles
   reflexes, monofilament, and pin sensation had more precise Ank(PRO). LPT
   of <12 seconds yielded a sensitivity/specificity of 91\%/80\% for
   identifying Hip(RTD) < 0.25 (body size in Newton-meters), and vibratory
   perception of < 8 seconds yielded a sensitivity/specificity of 94\%/80\%
   for the identification of Ank(PRO) >1.0 degrees.
   Conclusions: LPT is a more effective measure of Hip(RTD) than MMT.
   Similarly, clinical vibratory sense and monofilament testing are
   effective measures of Ank(PRO), whereas clinical proprioceptive sense is
   not.}},

Abstract = {{As user demand scales for intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as
   Apple's Siri, Google's Google Now, and Microsoft's Cortana, we are
   approaching the computational limits of current datacenter (DC)
   architectures. It is an open question how future server architectures
   should evolve to enable this emerging class of applications, and the
   lack of an open-source IPA workload is an obstacle in addressing this
   question. In this article, we present the design of Sirius, an open
   end-to-end IPA Web-service application that accepts queries in the form
   of voice and images, and responds with natural language. We then use
   this workload to investigate the implications of four points in the
   design space of future accelerator-based server architectures spanning
   traditional CPUs, GPUs, manycore throughput co-processors, and FPGAs. To
   investigate future server designs for Sirius, we decompose Sirius into a
   suite of eight benchmarks (Sirius Suite) comprising the computationally
   intensive bottlenecks of Sirius. We port Sirius Suite to a spectrum of
   accelerator platforms and use the performance and power trade-offs
   across these platforms to perform a total cost of ownership (TCO)
   analysis of various server design points. In our study, we find that
   accelerators are critical for the future scalability of IPA services.
   Our results show that GPU- and FPGA-accelerated servers improve the
   query latency on average by 8.5x and 15x, respectively. For a given
   throughput, GPU- and FPGA-accelerated servers can reduce the TCO of DCs
   by 2.3x and 1.3x, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineered scaffolds (TES) hold promise for improving the outcome
   of cell-based therapeutic strategies for a variety of biomedical
   scenarios, including musculoskeletal injuries, soft tissue repair, and
   spinal cord injury. Key to TES research and development, and clinical
   use, is the ability to longitudinally monitor TES location, orientation,
   integrity, and microstructure following implantation. Here, we describe
   a strategy for using microcomputed tomography (microCT) to visualize TES
   following implantation into mice. TES were doped with highly radiopaque
   gadolinium oxide nanocrystals and were implanted into the hind limbs of
   mice. Mice underwent serial microCT over 23 weeks. TES were clearly
   visible over the entire time course. Alginate scaffolds underwent a 20\%
   volume reduction over the first 6 weeks, stabilizing over the next 17
   weeks. Agarose scaffold volumes were unchanged. TES attenuation was also
   unchanged over the entire time course, indicating a lack of nanocrystal
   dissolution or leakage. Histology at the implant site showed the
   presence of very mild inflammation, typical for a mild foreign body
   reaction. Blood work indicated marked elevation in liver enzymes, and
   hematology measured significant reduction in white blood cell counts.
   While extrapolation of the X-ray induced effects on hematopoiesis in
   these mice to humans is not straightforward, clearly this is an area for
   careful monitoring. Taken together, these data lend strong support that
   doping TES with radiopaque nanocrystals and performing microCT imaging,
   represents a possible strategy for enabling serial in vivo monitoring of
   TES.}},

Abstract = {{This paper first demonstrates analytically that, at millisecond
   timescales, the adaptive optics system in a ground-based telescope will
   maintain the faint planetary emission nearly constant in time, while the
   speckle intensity at the planet's location will undergo wild
   fluctuations. Then, it presents a method for the simultaneous
   determination of the image of an exo-planetary system and pupil-plane
   aberrations that are not corrected by the adaptive optics system
   (so-called ``non-common path aberrations{''}), which cause a confounding
   speckle background. The central idea of the method is to take
   simultaneous millisecond exposures in both the wavefront sensor and
   science camera, and then perform statistical inference procedures to
   determine both the aberrations and planetary image. The statistical
   inference is based on a Taylor expansion of an exponential containing
   the aberration function. While the first order terms given in the paper
   are correct, it is missing some second-order terms, which are important
   when the aberrations are large enough so that a first order expansion is
   not adequate. Since the numerical experiments used small aberrations,
   this correction has little effect on the results.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the Thermal Performance Curves (TPCs) of 87 species of
   rainforest ants and found support for both the Thermal Adaptation and
   Phosphorus Tolerance hypotheses. TPCs relate a fitness proxy (here,
   worker speed) to environmental temperature. Thermal Adaptation posits
   that thermal generalists (ants with flatter, broader TPCs) are favored
   in the hotter, more variable tropical canopy compared to the cooler,
   less variable litter below. As predicted, species nesting in the forest
   canopy 1) had running speeds less sensitive to temperature; 2) ran over
   a greater range of temperatures; and 3) ran at lower maximum speeds.
   Tradeoffs between tolerance and maximum performance are often invoked
   for constraining the evolution of thermal generalists. There was no
   evidence that ant species traded off thermal tolerance for maximum
   speed, however. Phosphorus Tolerance is a second mechanism for
   generating ectotherms able to tolerate thermal extremes. It posits that
   ants active at high temperatures invest in P rich machinery to buffer
   their metabolism against thermal extremes. Phosphorus content in ant
   tissue varied three fold, and as predicted, temperature sensitivity was
   lower and thermal range was higher in P rich species. Combined, we show
   how the vertical distribution of hot and variable vs. cooler and stable
   microclimates in a single forest contribute to a diversity of TPCs and
   suggest that a widely varying P stoichiometry among these ants may drive
   some of these differences.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor radon-in-air (IR) concentrations in dwellings situated on a fault
   line passing underneath Muzaffarabad City were measured with a
   continuous radon monitor. Measurements were taken at half an hour
   intervals at 11 sites for 48h. The values ranged from 14 +/- 1 to 155
   +/- 4Bq.m(-3) with an average value of 42 +/- 2Bq.m(-3). The geometric
   mean (GM), standard deviation (STD) and geometric standard deviation
   (GSD) were 32 +/- 2, 40.2 +/- 0.8 and 1.5Bq.m(-3), respectively. Annual
   mean effective doses ranged between 0.35 +/- 0.03 and 3.9 +/-
   0.1mSv.y(-1) with an overall mean value 1.05 +/- 0.05mSv.y(-1). The
   experimental data were analysed by comparing algorithms to extract phase
   space dynamical information in the radon time series. Such approaches
   are potentially useful for deriving methods of extrapolation of
   short-term measurements to annualized average predictions and for
   earthquake detection. The computed values for Hurst exponent (H) from
   the rescaled range analysis and the Lyapunov exponent (L) provided
   estimates of the degree of chaotic regime. The Hurst exponent (0.877)
   for the radon time series indicates that the radon time series is a
   persistent time series. The value of Lyapunov exponent (0.0021) shows
   deterministic chaos in the data. The permutation entropy value was
   0.6894 reflecting the irregularity in IR time series. The value of
   entropy obtained confirmed that the predictability of the IR time series
   is restricted to approximately one time step into the future. The mean
   value of IR concentrations corresponds to excess relative risks (ERR) of
   radon-induced lung cancer for 35- and 55-year-olds at all sites of 0.25
   +/- 0.01 and 0.205 +/- 0.01, respectively. The observed 48-h average
   level (42 +/- 2Bq.m(-3)) was less than those recommended by the World
   Health Organization (WHO) (100Bq.m(-3)), US Environmental Protection
   Agency (148Bq.m(-3)) and Health Protection Agency, UK (200Bq.m(-3)).}},

Abstract = {{The effect of relative density on the hardness and fracture toughness of
   Al-substituted cubic garnet Li6.19Al0.27La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) was
   investigated. Polycrystalline LLZO was made using solid-state synthesis
   and hot-pressing. The relative density was controlled by varying the
   densification time at fixed temperature (1050 degrees C) and pressure
   (62 MPa). After hot-pressing, the average grain size varied from
   approximately 2.7-3.7 m for the 85\% and 98\% relative density samples,
   respectively. Examination of fracture surfaces revealed a transition
   from inter- to intragranular fracture as the relative density increased.
   The Vickers hardness increased with relative density up to 96\%, above
   which the hardness was constant. At 98\% relative density, the Vickers
   hardness was equal to the hardness measured by nanoindentation 9.1 GPa,
   which is estimated as the single-crystal hardness value. An inverse
   correlation between relative density and fracture toughness was
   observed. The fracture toughness increased linearly from 0.97 to 2.37
   MPam for the 98\% and 85\% relative density samples, respectively. It is
   suggested that crack deflection along grain boundaries can explain the
   increase in fracture toughness with decreasing relative density. It was
   also observed that the total ionic conductivity increased from 0.0094 to
   0.34 mS/cm for the 85\%-98\% relative density samples, respectively. The
   results of this study suggest that the microstructure of LLZO must be
   optimized to maximize mechanical integrity and ionic conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced matrix packing density and tailored fiber-to-matrix interface
   bond properties have led to the recent development of ultra-high
   performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHP-FRC) with improved material
   tensile performance in terms of strength, ductility and energy
   absorption capacity. The objective of this research is to experimentally
   investigate and analyze the uniaxial tensile behavior of UHP-FRC under
   various strain rates, ranging from 0.0001 to 0.1 1/s. A direct tensile
   test set up is used. The experimental parameters encompass three types
   of steel fibers, each in three different volume fractions at four
   different strain rates resulting in 36 test series. Elastic and strain
   hardening tensile parameters, such as, cracking stress, elastic and
   strain hardening modulus, composite tensile strength and strain, energy
   absorption capacity, and crack spacing of the UHP-FRC specimens, are
   recorded and analyzed. Explanation of the material's strain rate
   sensitivity is mainly based on the inertia effect of matrix micro
   cracking. Potential contributions of other mechanisms include viscosity
   of water within nanopores and confinement effects. Dynamic impact factor
   (DIF) formulas are provided based on the experimental data to illustrate
   the relationship between DIF and strain rate for UHP-FRC.}},

Abstract = {{It remains unclear whether causal, rather than merely correlational,
   relationships in molecular networks can be inferred in complex
   biological settings. Here we describe the HPN-DREAM network inference
   challenge, which focused on learning causal influences in signaling
   networks. We used phosphoprotein data from cancer cell lines as well as
   in silico data from a nonlinear dynamical model. Using the
   phosphoprotein data, we scored more than 2,000 networks submitted by
   challenge participants. The networks spanned 32 biological contexts and
   were scored in terms of causal validity with respect to unseen
   interventional data. A number of approaches were effective, and
   incorporating known biology was generally advantageous. Additional
   sub-challenges considered time-course prediction and visualization. Our
   results suggest that learning causal relationships may be feasible in
   complex settings such as disease states. Furthermore, our scoring
   approach provides a practical way to empirically assess inferred
   molecular networks in a causal sense.}},

Abstract = {{A new generation of telescopes with mirror diameters of 20 m or more,
   called extremely large telescopes (ELTs), has the potential to provide
   unprecedented imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanetary systems, if the
   difficulties in achieving the extremely high dynamic range required to
   differentiate the planetary signal from the star can be overcome to a
   sufficient degree. Fully utilizing the potential of ELTs for exoplanet
   imaging will likely require simultaneous and self-consistent
   determination of both the planetary image and the unknown aberrations in
   multiple planes of the optical system, using statistical inference based
   on the wavefront sensor and science camera data streams. This approach
   promises to overcome the most important systematic errors inherent in
   the various schemes based on differential imaging, such as angular
   differential imaging and spectral differential imaging. This paper is
   the first in a series on this subject, in which a formalism is
   established for the exoplanet imaging problem, setting the stage for the
   statistical inference methods to follow in the future. Every effort has
   been made to be rigorous and complete, so that validity of
   approximations to be made later can be assessed. Here, the polarimetric
   image is expressed in terms of aberrations in the various planes of a
   polarizing telescope with an adaptive optics system. Further, it is
   shown that current methods that utilize focal plane sensing to correct
   the speckle field, e. g., electric field conjugation, rely on the tacit
   assumption that aberrations on multiple optical surfaces can be
   represented as aberration on a single optical surface, ultimately
   limiting their potential effectiveness for groundbased astronomy. (C)

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis of an amphiphilic triblock copolymer composed of
   a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol) (PEG) block, a central poly(acrylic
   acid) (PAA) block, and a hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
   block using atom transfer radical polymerization technique. We examined
   the self-assembly of PEG-b-PAA-b-PMMA copolymers in aqueous solutions
   forming nanosized micelles and their ability to encapsulate hydrophobic
   guest molecules such as Nile Red (NR) dye and cabazitaxel (CTX, an
   anticancer drug). We used 2,2
   beta'-(propane-2,2-diylbis(oxy))-diethanamine to react with the
   carboxylic acid groups of the central PAA block forming acid-labile,
   shell cross-linked micelles (SCLM). We investigated the loading
   efficiency and release of different guest molecules from
   non-cross-linked micelles (NSCLM) and shell cross-linked micelles (SCLM)
   prepared by reacting 50\% (SCLM-50) and 100\% (SCLM-100) of the
   carboxylic acid groups in the PAA in physiologic (pH 7.4) and acidic (pH
   5.0) buffer solutions as a function of time. We examined the uptake of
   NR-loaded NSCLM, SCLM-50, and SCLM-100 micelles into PC-3 and C4-2B
   prostate cancer cells and the effect of different micelle compositions
   on membrane fluidity of both cell lines. We also investigated the effect
   of CTX-loaded NSCLM, SCLM-50, and SCLM-100 micelles on the viability of
   PC-3 and C4-2B cancer cells compared to free CTX as a function of drug
   concentration. Results show that PEG-b-PAA-b-PMMA polymers form micelles
   at concentrations >= 11 mu g/mL with an average size of 40-50 nm. CTX
   was encapsulated in PEG-b-PAA-b-PMMA micelles with 55\% loading
   efficiency in NSCLM. In vitro release studies showed that 30\% and 85\%
   of the loaded CTX was released from SCLM-50 micelles in physiologic (pH
   7.4) and acidic (pH 5.0) buffer solutions over 30 h, confirming
   micelles' sensitivity to solution pH. Results show uptake of NSCLM and
   SCLM into prostate cancer cells delivering their chemotherapeutic cargo,
   which triggered efficient cancer cell death. PEG-b-PAA-b-PMMA micelles
   were not hemolytic and did not cause platelet aggregation, which
   indicate their biocompatibility.}},

Title = {{A Multilevel Quasi-Static Kinetics Method for Pin-Resolved Transport
   Transient Reactor Analysis}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{182}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{435-451}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D), full-core transport modeling with pin-resolved
   detail for reactor dynamic simulation is important for some multiphysics
   reactor applications. However, it can be computationally intensive due
   to the difficulty in maintaining accuracy while minimizing the number of
   time steps. An innovative Predictor-Corrector Quasi-static Method (PCQM)
   is introduced that is based on a Transient MultiLevel (TML) methodology.
   Two levels of couplings are used between 3D-transport/3D-CMFD
   (coarse-mesh finite difference) and 3D-CMFD/EPKE (exact point-kinetics
   equation). In each level, the original flux equation is solved in the
   coarse predictor step and then is factorized as an amplitude and a shape
   function in the corrector step, where the predicted solution is adjusted
   using multiple fine steps. In the first-level 3D-transport/3D-CMFD
   coupling, the angular and subpin flux shape functions in the Boltzmann
   transport equation are assumed to vary slowly over time, and the CMFD
   cellwise amplitude function is solved using multiple steps by the
   3D-CMFD transient equation. In the second level, the CMFD scalar flux
   calculated in the last step is further corrected by a whole-core-wise
   amplitude function generated by the EPKE solver. The utilization of
   hierarchical multilevel neutronics transient solvers achieves the goal
   to balance the numerical accuracy and computational efficiency. In
   addition, a new iteration scheme with pin-resolve thermal-hydraulic
   feedback and theoretical proof for the accuracy of PCQM are also
   presented. Finally, a stripe assembly case adopted from the SPERT
   (Special Power Excursion Reactor Test) transient tests is used to
   demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the TML method.}},

   Single Phase Alloys}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Recently a new class of metal alloys, of single-phase multicomponent
   composition at roughly equal atomic concentrations ({''}equiatomic{''}),
   have been shown to exhibit promising mechanical, magnetic, and corrosion
   resistance properties, in particular, at high temperatures. These
   features make them potential candidates for components of
   next-generation nuclear reactors and other high-radiation environments
   that will involve high temperatures combined with corrosive environments
   and extreme radiation exposure. In spite of a wide range of recent
   studies of many important properties of these alloys, their radiation
   tolerance at high doses remains unexplored. In this work, a combination
   of experimental and modeling efforts reveals a substantial reduction of
   damage accumulation under prolonged irradiation in single-phase NiFe and
   NiCoCr alloys compared to elemental Ni. This effect is explained by
   reduced dislocation mobility, which leads to slower growth of large
   dislocation structures. Moreover, there is no observable phase
   separation, ordering, or amorphization, pointing to a high phase
   stability of this class of alloys.}},

Abstract = {{Intercalibrating multiple radiometers using data from collocated oceanic
   fields of view has been a critical method for assessing in-flight
   instrument performance and reconciling constellation data. In this
   letter, we present a simple and effective improved method for radiometer
   intercalibration and apply it to the Global Precipitation Measurement
   (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI), the core radiometer of the GPM
   constellation. By optimizing the collocation criteria, this method is
   able to produce improved scan-dependent calibration as indicated by the
   ability to characterize small-scale anomalies and edge-of-scan biases
   within GMI observations. The accurate characterization of scan-dependent
   calibration also allows further examination of the intercalibration
   dependence on brightness temperature (TB). An effective novel method
   using the cumulative distribution of TBs is used to examine the impact
   of TB on scan-dependent calibration. It is shown that intercalibration
   is dependent on TB; however, the GMI magnetic anomalies are additive
   signals independent of TB and therefore can be corrected by simply
   subtracting it from the data.}},

Abstract = {{High-speed pulse-shape analysis can allow one to extract the physical
   parameters that govern radiation interaction. This brief presents a
   transimpedance preamplifier that can replace conventional configurations
   that contain a charge-sensitive preamplifier and shaping amplifier
   chain, particularly for high-speed radiation measurement systems. A
   transimpedance amplifier is a primary circuit of the preamplifier design
   based on a feedback structure with cascade inverting amplifiers and a
   feedback resistor, but it incorporates a bandwidth and gain enhancement
   technique that utilizes a series LC circuit at the input of the
   amplifier. This configuration is designed to reduce the size, power
   consumption, and complexity of the front-end circuitry traditionally
   used in radiation measurements while enhancing pulse-shape analyses by
   preserving the temporal information of the carriers following radiation
   impingement. The preamplifier implemented in the 180-nm CMOS process
   exhibits an 83-dBO transimpedance gain and a 1.75-GHz bandwidth while
   consuming 48.6 mW using a 1.8-V supply.}},

Abstract = {{By performing stability analysis on an optimal tour for problems
   belonging to classes of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), this paper
   derives margins of optimality for a solution with respect to
   disturbances in the problem data. Specifically, we consider the
   asymmetric sequence-dependent TSP, where the sequence dependence is
   driven by the dynamics of a stack. This is a generalization of the
   symmetric non sequence-dependent version of the TSP. Furthermore, we
   also consider the symmetric sequence-dependent variant and the
   asymmetric non sequence-dependent variant. Amongst others these problems
   have applications in logistics and unmanned aircraft mission planning.
   Changing external conditions such as traffic or weather may alter task
   costs, which can render an initially optimal itinerary suboptimal.
   Instead of optimizing the itinerary every time task costs change,
   stability criteria allow for fast evaluation of whether itineraries
   remain optimal. This paper develops a method to compute stability
   regions for the best tour in a set of tours for the symmetric TSP and
   extends the results to the asymmetric problem as well as their
   sequence-dependent counterparts. As the TSP is NP-hard, heuristic
   methods are frequently used to solve it. The presented approach is also
   applicable to analyze stability regions for a tour obtained through
   application of the k-opt heuristic with respect to the k-neighborhood. A
   dimensionless criticality metric for edges is proposed, such that a high
   criticality of an edge indicates that the optimal tour is more
   susceptible to cost changes in that edge. Multiple examples demonstrate
   the application of the developed stability computation method as well as
   the edge criticality measure that facilitates an intuitive assessment of
   instances of the TSP.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Many of today's power-split hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) utilize
   planetary gears (PGs) to connect the powertrain elements together.
   Recent power-split HEVs tend to use two PGs and some of them have
   multiple modes to achieve better fuel economy and driving performance.
   Looking to the future, hybrid powertrain technologies must be enhanced
   to design hybrid light trucks. For light trucks, the need for multi-mode
   and more PGs is stronger, to achieve the required performance. To
   systematically explore all the possible designs of multi-mode HEVs with
   three PGs, an efficient searching and optimization methodology is
   proposed. All possible clutch topology and modes for one existing
   configuration that uses three PGs were exhaustively searched. The
   launching performance is first used to screen out designs that fail to
   satisfy the required launching performance. A near-optimal and
   computationally efficient energy management strategy was then employed
   to identify designs that achieve good fuel economy. The proposed design
   process successfully identify 8 designs that achieve better launching
   performance and better fuel economy, while using fewer number of
   clutches than the benchmark and a patented design.}},

Title = {{Splitting of a two-dimensional liquid plug at an airway bifurcation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{793}},
Pages = {{1-20}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Certain medical treatments involve the introduction of exogenous liquids
   in the lungs. These liquids can form plugs within the airways. The plugs
   propagate throughout the branching network in the lungs being forced by
   airflow. They leave a deposited film on the airway walls and split at
   bifurcations. Understanding the resulting distribution of liquid
   throughout the lungs is important for the effective administration of
   the prescribed treatments. In this paper, we investigate numerically the
   splitting of a liquid plug by a two-dimensional pulmonary bifurcation
   under the influence of a transverse gravitational field. The splitting
   is characterized by the splitting ratio, which is the ratio of volume of
   the liquid plug in the daughter channels and depends on the capillary
   number and the orientation of the bifurcation plane with respect to a
   three-dimensional gravitational field. It is observed that gravity
   induces asymmetry in the splitting, causing the splitting ratio to he
   reduced. This effect is mitigated as the capillary number is increased.
   It is also observed that there exists a critical capillary number where
   the plug will not split and will instead propagate entirely into the
   gravitationally favoured daughter channel We also compute the wall
   stresses on the bifurcation walls and observe the locations where
   stresses and their gradients are the highest in magnitude.}},

Title = {{Computations of equilibrium and non-equilibrium turbulent channel flows
   using a nested-LES approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{793}},
Pages = {{709-748}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A new nested-LES approach for computation of high Reynolds number,
   equilibrium, and non-equilibrium, wall-bounded turbulent flows is
   presented. The method couples coarse-resolution LES in the full
   computational domain with fine-resolution LES in a minimal flow unit to
   retain the accuracy of well-resolved LES throughout the computational
   domain, including in the near-wall region, while significantly reducing
   the computational cost. The two domains are coupled by renormalizing the
   instantaneous velocity fields in each domain dynamically during the
   course of the simulation to match the wall-normal profiles of
   single-time, ensemble-averaged kinetic energies of the components of
   `mean' and fluctuating velocities in the inner layer to those of the
   minimal flow unit, and in the outer layer to those of the full domain.
   This simple renormalization procedure is shown to correct the energy
   spectra and wall shear stresses in both domains, thus leading to
   accurate turbulence statistics. The nested LES approach has been applied
   to computation of equilibrium turbulent channel flow at Re-tau
   approximate to 1000, 2000, 5000, 10 000, and non-equilibrium, strained
   turbulent channel flow at Re-tau approximate to 2000. In both flows,
   nested-LES predicts the skin friction coefficient, first- and
   higher-order turbulence statistics, spectra and structure of the flow in
   agreement with available DNS and experimental data. Nested-LES can be
   applied to any flow with at least one direction of local or global
   homogeneity, while reducing the required number of grid points from
   O(Re-tau(2)) of conventional LES to O(log Re-tau) or O(Re-tau) in flows
   with two or one locally or globally homogeneous directions,
   respectively.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{310}},
Pages = {{118-129}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Three phenomenological force and swelling models are developed to
   predict mechanical phenomena caused by Li-ion intercalation: a 1-D force
   model, a 1st order relaxation model, and a 3-D swelling model. The 1-D
   force model can estimate the Li-ion intercalation induced force for
   actual pack conditions with preloads. The model incorporates a nonlinear
   elastic stiffness to capture the mechanical consequences of Li-ion
   intercalation swelling. The model also separates the entire state of
   charge range into three regions considering phase transitions. The 1st
   order relaxation model predicts dynamic swelling during relaxation
   periods. A coefficient of relaxation is estimated from dynamic and
   quasi-static swelling at operational conditions. The 3-D swelling model
   predicts the swelling shape on the battery surface for all states of
   charge. This model introduces an equivalent modulus of elasticity, which
   is dependent on the state of charge, to capture material transformations
   of the electrodes, and the orthotropic expansion of the jellyroll in a
   direction perpendicular to the electrode surfaces. Considering the
   simplicity of the measurements and direct physical correlations between
   stress and strain, the proposed models can enhance battery management
   systems and power management strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess the uncertainty in T-1
   measurement, by estimating the repeatability coefficient (RC) from two
   repeated scans, in normal appearing brain tissues employing two
   different T-1 mapping methods. All brain MRI scans were performed on a
   3T MR scanner in 10 patients who had low grade/benign tumors and partial
   brain radiation therapy (RT) without chemotherapy, at pre-RT, 3weeks
   into RT, end RT (6weeks) and 11, 33, and 85weeks after RT. T-1-weighted
   images were acquired using (1) a spoiled gradient echo sequence with two
   flip angles (2FA: 5 degrees and 15 degrees) and (2) a progressive
   saturation recovery sequence (pSR) with five different TR values
   (100-2000ms). Manually drawn volumes of interest (VOIs) included left
   and right normal putamen and thalamus in gray matter, and frontal and
   parietal white matter, which were distant from tumors and received a
   total of accumulated radiation doses less than 5Gy at 3weeks. No
   significant changes or even trends in mean T-1 from pre-RT to 3weeks
   into RT in these VOIs (p0.11, Wilcoxon sign test) allowed us to
   calculate the repeatability statistics of between-subject means of
   squares, within-subject means of squares, F-score, and RC. The 2FA
   method produced RCs in the range of (9.7-11.7)\% in gray matter and
   (12.2-14.5)\% in white matter; while the pSR method led to RCs ranging
   from 10.9 to 17.9\% in gray matter and 7.5 to 10.3\% in white matter.
   The overall mean (+/- SD) RCs produced by the two methods, 12.0 (+/-
   1.6)\% for 2FA and 12.0 (+/- 3.8)\% for pSR, were not significantly
   different (p=0.97). A similar repeatability in T-1 measurement produced
   by the time efficient 2FA method compared with the time consuming pSR
   method demonstrates that the 2FA method is desirable to integrate into
   dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for rapid acquisition. Copyright (c) 2016

Abstract = {{The expanding penetration of nondispatchable renewable resources within
   power system generation portfolios is motivating the development of
   demand-side strategies for balancing generation and load. Commercial
   heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads are potential
   candidates for providing such demand-response (DR) services as they
   consume significant energy and because of the temporal flexibility
   offered by their inherent thermal inertia. Several ancillary services
   markets have recently opened up to participation by DR resources,
   provided they can satisfy certain performance metrics. We discuss
   different control strategies for providing frequency regulation DR from
   commercial HVAC systems and components, and compare performance results
   from experiments and simulation. We also present experimental results
   from a single similar to 30 000-m(2) office building and quantify the DR
   control performance using standardized performance criteria.
   Additionally, we evaluate the cost of delivering this service by
   comparing the energy consumed while providing DR against a
   counterfactual baseline.}},

Title = {{Adaptive burnup stepsize selection using control theory for 2-D lattice
   depletion simulations}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY}},

Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{218-230}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A control theory approach is adopted to determine the temporal
   discretization during two-dimensional lattice physics depletion
   simulations. Two primary applications of automated and adaptive stepsize
   control are identified: (i) the presence of strong absorbers such as
   gadolinium, where the accurate burnout of the isotopes requires a
   depletion stepsize smaller than typically required, and (ii) high
   fidelity multiphysics simulations, e.g. loosely coupled physics, where
   the coupled physics are nonlinear in time and stepsize changes may be
   necessary to obtain an accurate coupled solution. A conventional
   predictor corrector method is used to address the nonlinearity of the
   nuclide transmutation and neutron flux. An adaptive stepsize method is
   developed based on monitoring the one-group scalar neutron flux at both
   the predictor and corrector steps to approximate the convergence
   residual of the nonlinear solution. A user-specified tolerance on the
   L-2 relative error norm of the scalar neutron flux is utilized by the
   stepsize controller. Controllers that include integral, proportional,
   and/or derivative components are investigated and parameterized using
   Latin hypercube sampling of the controller input parameters. Three
   distinct fuel loadings of pressurized water reactor 17 x 17 fuel pin
   assemblies are considered, including no burnable absorbers, Integral
   Fuel Burnable Absorber, and gadolinium fuel pins. The required depletion
   stepsizes, as predicted throughout the cycle by the controller, are
   compared with a very small stepsize (0.01 MW d/kgHM) reference solution
   and a solution obtained by a typical rule of thumb depletion stepsize
   sequence. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanodroplet-mediated histotripsy (NMH) is a targeted ablation technique
   combining histotripsy with nanodroplets that can be selectively
   delivered to tumor cells. In two previous studies, polymer-encapsulated
   perfluoropentane nanodroplets were used to generate well-defined
   ablation similar to that obtained with histotripsy, but at significantly
   lower pressure, whenNMHtherapy was applied at a pulse repetition
   frequency (PRF) of 10 Hz. However, cavitation was not maintained over
   multiple pulses when ultrasound was applied at a lower PRF (i.e., 1-5
   Hz). We hypothesized that nanodroplets with a higher-boiling-point
   perfluorocarbon core would provide sustainable cavitation nuclei,
   allowing cavitation to be maintained over multiple pulses, even at low
   PRF, which is needed for efficient and complete tissue fractionation via
   histotripsy. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of
   droplet composition on NMH therapy by applying histotripsy at various
   frequencies (345 kHz, 500 kHz, 1.5 MHz, 3 MHz) to tissue phantoms
   containing perfluoropentane (PFP, boiling point similar to 29 degrees C,
   surface tension similar to 9.5 mN/m) and perfluorohexane (PFH, boiling
   point similar to 56 degrees C, surface tension similar to 11.9 mN/m)
   nanodroplets. First, the effects of droplet composition on the NMH
   cavitation threshold were investigated, with results revealing a
   significant decrease (>10 MPa) in the peak negative pressure (p-)
   cavitation threshold for both types of nanodroplets compared with
   controls. A slight decrease (similar to 1-3 MPa) in threshold was
   observed for PFP phantoms compared with PFH phantoms. Next, the ability
   of nanodroplets to function as sustainable cavitation nuclei over
   multiple pulses was investigated, with results revealing that PFH
   nanodroplets were sustainable cavitation nuclei over 1,000 pulses,
   whereas PFP nanodroplets were destroyed during the first few pulses (<50
   pulses), likely because of the lower boiling point. Finally, tissue
   phantoms containing a layer of embedded red blood cells were used to
   compare the damage generated for NMH treatments using PFP and PFH
   droplets, with results indicating that PFH nanodroplets significantly
   improved NMH ablation, allowing for well-defined lesions to be generated
   at all frequencies and PRFs tested. Overall, the results of this study
   provide significant insight into the role of droplet composition in NMH
   therapy and provide a rational basis to tailor droplet parameters to
   improve NMH tissue fractionation. (E-mail: melsayed@umich.edu or

Abstract = {{Algae have enormous potential as bio-factories for the efficient
   production of a wide array of high-value products, and eventually as a
   source of renewable biofuels. However, tools for engineering the nuclear
   genomes of algae remain scarce and limited in functionality. In this
   study, synthetic algal promoters (saps) were generated as a tool for
   increasing nuclear gene expression and as a model for understanding
   promoter elements and structure in green algae. Promoters were generated
   to mimic native cis-motif elements, structure, and overall nucleotide
   composition of top expressing genes from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
   Twenty five saps were used to drive expression of a fluorescent reporter
   in transgenic algae. A majority of the promoters were functional in vivo
   and seven were identified to drive expression of the fluorescent
   reporter better than the current best endogenous promoter in C.
   reinhardtii, the chimeric hsp70/rbs2 promoter. Further analysis of the
   best synthetic promoter, sap11, revealed a new DNA motif essential for
   promoter function that is widespread and highly conserved in C.
   reinhardtii. These data demonstrate the utility of synthetic promoters
   to drive gene expression in green algae, and lays the groundwork for the
   development of a suite of saps capable of driving the robust and complex
   gene expression that will be required for algae to reach their potential
   as an industrial platform for photosynthetic bio-manufacturing. (C) 2016

Volume = {{234}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1077-1084}},

Abstract = {{The dual-task (motor and cognitive) performance of eight older adults
   (72.0 +/- A 6.4 years; 5 female; 3 male) was evaluated. Vocal choice
   reaction times (cognitive task) were measured at standstill as well as
   during unperturbed and perturbed gait (motor task). The perturbation was
   administered using customized shoes instrumented to lower a small (18.4
   mm high) aluminum flap suddenly under the medial or lateral forefoot
   during a single swing phase of 12 of 30 gait trials. The ankle inverted
   or everted an average of 10 or 9 degrees, respectively, depending on the
   flap deployed. Medial and lateral perturbations were randomized between
   the left and right feet. The results show that vocal choice reaction
   time was significantly prolonged by gait, both perturbed (614.7 +/- A
   80.2 ms) and unperturbed (529.9 +/- A 119.3 ms), compared to standstill
   (332.8 +/- A 76.5 ms; p = 0.0015). Further, the prolongation associated
   with gait perturbation was significant, compared to that with
   unperturbed gait (p = 0.016). The kinematics of the first
   post-perturbation (recovery) step, with or without concomitant vocal
   choice reaction task performance, was not significantly different from
   those of the average step during unperturbed gait. We conclude that in
   healthy older adults, the requirement to respond to a gait challenge
   resulted in deterioration in the performance of a concurrent cognitive
   task as indicated by significant prolongation of response time in the
   vocal choice reaction task. In contrast, performance of the motor task
   was not adversely affected.}},

Title = {{Eliminating Periodic Flush Overhead of File I/O with Non-Volatile Buffer
   Cache}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1145-1157}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{File I/O buffer caching plays an important role to narrow the wide speed
   gap between main memory and secondary storage. However, data loss or
   inconsistency may occur if the system crashes before updated data in the
   buffer cache is flushed to storage. Thus, most operating systems adopt a
   daemon that periodically flushes dirty data to secondary storage. This
   periodic flush degrades the caching efficiency seriously because most
   write requests lead to direct storage accesses. We show that periodic
   flush accounts for 30-70 percent of the total write traffic to storage.
   To remove this inefficiency, this paper presents a new buffer cache
   architecture that adopts a small amount of non-volatile memory to
   maintain modified data. This novel buffer cache architecture removes
   almost all storage accesses due to periodic flush operations without any
   loss of reliability. It also improves the buffer cache performance
   through space-efficient management techniques, such as delta-write and
   fragment-grouping. Our experimental results show that the proposed
   buffer cache reduces the storage write traffic by 44.3 percent and also
   improves the throughput by 23.6 percent on average.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the configuration, control, and implementation of a
   testing device to check the reliability of a high-voltage high-power
   distributed generation (DG) grid-connected converter. The device employs
   the cascaded H-bridge topology and generates abnormal voltages (AVs),
   i.e., voltage amplitude-frequency deviation, voltage fluctuation, and
   voltage unbalance that are associated with a typical power grid. A
   unified rms value feedback control (URFC) in the stationary frame (SF)
   is adopted, which has the advantages of a higher precision, an easier
   selection of controller parameters, and a higher reliability, compared
   with other existing control approaches in either synchronous reference
   frame or SF. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design
   concept of a DG grid-connected converter testing device (DGCTD) are
   validated by the real-world industrial field experiments performed on
   the ``35 kV-6 MW testing device,{''} under both no-load and load
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Of the different branches of indoor localization research, WiFi
   fingerprinting has drawn significant attention over the past decade.
   These localization systems function by comparing WiFi received signal
   strength indicator (RSSI) and a pre-established location-specific
   fingerprint map. However, due to the time-variant wireless signal
   strength, the RSSI fingerprint map needs to be calibrated periodically,
   incurring high labor and time costs. In addition, biased RSSI
   measurements across devices along with transmission power control
   techniques of WiFi routers further undermine the fidelity of existing
   fingerprint-based localization systems. To remedy these problems, we
   propose GradIent FingerprinTing (GIFT) which leverages a more stable
   RSSI gradient. GIFT first builds a gradientbased fingerprint map (Gmap)
   by comparing absolute RSSI values at nearby positions, and then runs an
   online extended particle filter (EPF) to localize the user/ device. By
   incorporating Gmap, GIFT is more adaptive to the time-variant RSSI in
   indoor environments, thus effectively reducing the overhead of
   fingerprint map calibration. We implemented GIFT on Android smartphones
   and tablets, and conducted extensive experiments in a five-story campus
   building. GIFT is shown to achieve an 80 percentile accuracy of 5.6 m
   with dynamic WiFi signals.}},

Abstract = {{Metric learning is a key problem for many data mining and machine
   learning applications, and has long been dominated by Mahalanobis
   methods. Recent advances in nonlinear metric learning have demonstrated
   the potential power of non-Mahalanobis distance functions, particularly
   tree-based functions. We propose a novel nonlinear metric learning
   method that uses an iterative, hierarchical variant of semi-supervised
   max-margin clustering to construct a forest of cluster hierarchies,
   where each individual hierarchy can be interpreted as a weak metric over
   the data. By introducing randomness during hierarchy training and
   combining the output of many of the resulting semi-random weak hierarchy
   metrics, we can obtain a powerful and robust nonlinear metric model.
   This method has two primary contributions: first, it is semi-supervised,
   incorporating information from both constrained and unconstrained
   points. Second, we take a relaxed approach to constraint satisfaction,
   allowing the method to satisfy different subsets of the constraints at
   different levels of the hierarchy rather than attempting to
   simultaneously satisfy all of them. This leads to a more robust learning
   algorithm. We compare our method to a number of state-of-the-art
   benchmarks on k-nearest neighbor classification, large-scale image
   retrieval and semi-supervised clustering problems, and find that our
   algorithm yields results comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-grained recognition concerns categorization at sub-ordinate levels,
   where the distinction between object classes is highly local. Compared
   to basic level recognition, fine-grained categorization can be more
   challenging as there are in general less data and fewer discriminative
   features. This necessitates the use of a stronger prior for feature
   selection. In this work, we include humans in the loop to help computers
   select discriminative features. We introduce a novel online game called
   ``Bubbles{''} that reveals discriminative features humans use. The
   player's goal is to identify the category of a heavily blurred image.
   During the game, the player can choose to reveal full details of
   circular regions ({''}bubbles{''}), with a certain penalty. With proper
   setup the game generates discriminative bubbles with assured quality. We
   next propose the ``BubbleBank{''} representation that uses the human
   selected bubbles to improve machine recognition performance. Finally, we
   demonstrate how to extend BubbleBank to a view-invariant 3D
   representation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields large
   improvements over the previous state of the art on challenging
   benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the optimization of a solar-powered humidification
   dehumidification (HDH) desalination system for remote areas where it is
   assumed that only minimal external electric power (for operating control
   systems and auxiliaries) is available. This work builds on a previous
   system by disconnecting the condenser from the saline water cycle and by
   introducing a solar air heater (SAH) to further augment the
   humidification performance. In addition, improved thermal simulation
   models for the condenser and the humidifier are used to obtain more
   accurate productivity estimations. The heuristic gradient projection
   (HGP) optimization procedure is also refactored to reduce the number of
   function evaluations, to reach the minimum unit cost of produced fresh
   water, compared to genetic algorithms (GAs). A case study which assumes
   a desalination plant on the Red Sea near the city of Hurghada. Egypt, is
   presented. The optimum systems are shown to significantly reduce the
   unit cost of fresh water production below the reported minimum
   (\$1.3/m(3) compared to \$3/m(3)), while keeping specific energy

Abstract = {{Nanostructures with chiral geometries exhibit strong polarization
   rotation. However, achieving reversible modulation of chirality and
   polarization rotation in device-friendly solid-state films is difficult
   for rigid materials. Here, we describe nanocomposites, made by
   conformally coating twisted elastic substrates with films assembled
   layer-by-layer from plasmonic nanocolloids, whose nanoscale geometry and
   rotatory optical activity can be reversibly reconfigured and cyclically
   modulated by macroscale stretching, with up to tenfold concomitant
   increases in ellipticity. We show that the chiroptical activity at 660nm
   of gold nanoparticle composites is associated with circular extinction
   from linear effects. The polarization rotation at 550nm originates from
   the chirality of nanoparticle chains with an S-like shape that exhibit a
   non-planar buckled geometry, with the handedness of the substrate's
   macroscale twist determining the handedness of the S-like chains.
   Chiroptical effects at the nexus of mechanics, excitonics and plasmonics
   open new operational principles for optical and optoelectronic devices
   from nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes and other nanoscale components.}},

Title = {{Micropolar Constitutive Relations for Cellular Solids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{With the recent development of micromechanics in micropolar solids, it
   is now possible to characterize the macroscopic mechanical behavior of
   cellular solids as a micropolar continuum. The aim of the present
   article is to apply these methods to determine the micropolar
   constitutive relation of various cellular solids. The main focus will be
   on the hexagonal packed circular honeycomb to demonstrate how its
   constitutive relationship is obtained. In addition, the same method will
   be applied to determine the material properties of a grid structure and
   a regular hexagon honeycomb. Since we model the cellular solid as an
   assembly of Euler-Bernoulli beams, we know that the macroscopic material
   properties will depend on the cell wall thickness, length, and Young's
   modulus. From this, and in conjunction with nondimensional analysis, we
   can provide a closed form solution, up to a multiplicative constant,
   without resorting to analyzing the governing equations. The
   multiplicative constant is evaluated through a single numerical
   simulation. The predicted values are then compared against assemblies
   with different local properties, using the numerical result as a
   benchmark since it takes into account higher order thickness effects. It
   is concluded that our closed form expressions vary from the numerical
   predictions only when the thickness of the beams increase, as expected
   since shear effects must be taken into account. However, for most
   engineering applications, these expressions are practical since our
   closed form solution with the Euler-Bernoulli assumption only produces
   about 10\% error for most extreme cases. Our results are also verified
   by comparing them against those reported in the literature.}},

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Determination of the aeroacoustic emission from an axial fan in a
   non-anechoic environment is a challenging experimental task given
   ambient noise and acoustic reflections from surrounding objects.
   Successful strategies to address this task for a representative nine and
   three blade fan are presented. An array consisting of ten microphones
   was constructed and placed in the upstream region of the axial fans to
   measure the fan acoustic signature at ten distinct locations. A novel
   delay and sum (DS) beamforming technique (that allows precise time
   delays to be established by the use of cross correlation techniques) was
   applied to the microphone outputs in order to separate the fans'
   acoustic emissions from the ambient noise and reflections from the
   facility walls. A numerical simulation was developed to represent the
   experimental facility and the measurements. The numerical simulation
   indicated that the extraneous noise can be satisfactorily separated from
   the fan noise using the array measurements and post processing the
   acoustic data with the present DS beamforming technique.}},

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) method is used for detection of
   visually obscured ferromagnetic objects. The method exploits the
   magnetic field originating from the ferromagnetic object, which
   constitutes an anomaly in the ambient earth's magnetic field.
   Traditionally, MAD is used to detect objects with a magnetic field of a
   dipole structure, where far from the object it can be considered as a
   point source. In the present work, we expand MAD to the case of a
   non-dipole source, i.e. a ferromagnetic pipeline. We use principal
   component analysis (PCA) to calculate the principal components, which
   are then employed to construct an effective detector. Experiments
   conducted in our lab with real-world data validate the above analysis.
   The simplicity, low computational complexity, and the high detection
   rate make the proposed detector attractive for real-time, low power
   applications.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned aircraft system navigation in urban environments requires
   consideration of which combination of sensors can provide the most
   accurate navigation results in a dynamically changing environment. The
   traditional Global Positioning System, although useful in open spaces,
   degrades severely when in urban canyons requiring other complementary
   sensors to provide position and velocity measurements when necessary.
   One well-known solution is vision-based sensors that provide
   measurements through optical flow. Another possibility is the long-term
   evolution network that is currently used for cellular voice and data
   transmission as well, as coarse Global-Positioning-System-independent
   navigation. This paper reviews sensor accuracy and availability as a
   function of environment characteristics. A simulation framework
   integrates these different types of sensors to allow for efficient
   high-level testing of sensor combinations and fusion algorithms. Results
   show that long-term evolution slightly improves position accuracy unless
   another exteroceptive position sensor such as vision is available.
   Sinusoidal trajectories that rise above the urban environment also show
   increases in accuracy as Global Positioning System navigation becomes
   available during these short windows.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatocellular carcinomas are frequently nonresponsive to systemically

   administration, maximizing the dose delivered to the tumor, achieving
   sustained elevated concentrations of the drug, while minimizing systemic
   exposure. Results: Ultrasound-guided deposition of doxorubicin (
   Dox)-eluting in situ forming implants ( ISFI) in an orthotopic tumor
   model significantly lowers systemic drug levels. As much as 60 mu g
   Dox/g tumors were observed 21 days after ISFI injection. Tumors treated
   with Dox implants also showed a considerable reduction in progression at
   21 days. Conclusion: Dox-eluting ISFIs provide a promising platform for
   the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas by which drug can be
   delivered directly into the lesion, bypassing distribution and

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{With the objective of enhancing the effectiveness of late fuel injection
   strategy in extending the low-load limit of homogeneous charge
   compression ignition engines, a numerical study is conducted to
   investigate the effects of fuel injection parameters, such as the
   injection pressure and spray cone angle, on the overall combustion
   efficiency and CO/NOx emissions. Closed-cycle engine simulations are
   performed incorporating detailed iso-octane reaction kinetics and
   combustion submodel based on the spray-interactive flamelet approach.
   Extensive parametric studies are conducted to provide a detailed map of
   the combustion efficiency and emission performance. In general, it is
   found that the in-cylinder charge stratification can be reduced by both
   an increased injection pressure and a wider spray cone angle, resulting
   in substantially lower NOx emissions and reasonably high combustion
   efficiency simultaneously. The present study demonstrates that an
   optimal adjustment of the two fuel injection parameters can result in
   significant extension of the low-load limit of homogeneous charge
   compression ignition through delayed fuel injection strategy.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology is introduced to analyze the drive cycle fuel economy of a
   vehicle equipped with a multimode combustion engine, utilizing
   commercial cam phasers and two-step cam profile switching. The analysis
   is based on a longitudinal vehicle model with manual transmission. The
   engine model employs a finite state machine describing mode switches
   between two distinct combustion modes, namely, spark-ignited and
   homogeneous charge compression ignition. Preliminary combustion mode
   switch experiments were used to parameterize the model. The influence of
   mode switch fuel penalties on drive cycle fuel economy was quantified
   through application of the model to the federal test procedure (FTP-75),
   the highway fuel economy test (HWFET) and the US06 supplemental federal
   test procedure. The mode switches were analyzed individually in terms of
   their benefit on fuel economy and a distinction was made between harmful
   and beneficial mode switches. Mode switches were defined as harmful
   whether their fuel penalty is greater than the benefits originating from
   spending time in the subsequent homogeneous charge compression ignition
   mode. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the impact of
   harmful mode switches on fuel economy as a function of the fuel
   penalties during the switch. In the case of high fuel penalties,
   supervisory control becomes an important tool for minimizing the number
   of harmful mode switches. One possible supervisory strategy discussed is
   a smoothing strategy, in which a mode switch is delayed by introducing a
   dwell time.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a low-order engine model to support model-based
   control development for mode transitions between spark ignition (SI) and
   homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion modes in
   gasoline engines. The modeling methodology focuses on cam switching mode
   transition strategies wherein the mode is abruptly changed between SI
   and recompression HCCI via a switch of the cam lift and phasing. The
   model is parameterized to a wide range of steady-state data which are
   selected to include conditions pertinent to cam switching mode
   transitions. An additional HCCI combustion model parameter is augmented
   and tuned based on transient data from SI to HCCI mode transitions where
   the conditions can be significantly outside any contained in the
   baseline steady-state parameterization. An adaptation routine is given
   which allows transient data be assimilated in online operation to update
   the augmented parameter and improve SI-HCCI transition predictions. With
   the baseline steady-state parameterization and augmented mode transition
   parameter, the model is shown to reproduce both steady-state data and
   transient performance output time histories from SI-HCCI transitions
   with considerable accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of algae species, reaction time, and
   reactor loading on the biocrude yield from fast hydrothermal
   liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae. Fast HTL reaction times were always
   less than 2 min and employed rapid heating and nonisothermal conditions.
   The highest biocrude yield obtained was 67 +/- 5 wt.\% (dry basis). With
   all other process variables fixed, increasing the reaction time in a 600
   degrees C sand bath by 15 s increments led to a rapid increase in
   biocrude yield between 15 and 45 s. At longer times, the biocrude yield
   decreased. Low reactor loadings generally gave higher biocrude yields
   than did higher loadings. The low reactor loadings may facilitate
   biocrude production by facilitating cell rupture and/or increasing the
   effective concentration of algal cells in the hot, compressed water in
   the reactor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One obstacle in neural repair is facilitating axon growth long enough to
   reach denervated targets. Recent studies show that axonal growth is
   accelerated by applying tension to bundles of neurites, and additional
   studies show that mechanical tension is critical to all neurite growth.
   However, no studies yet describe how individual neurons respond to
   tensile forces applied to cell bodies and neurites simultaneously;
   neither do any test motor neurons, a phenotype critical to neural
   repair. Here we examine the growth of dissociated motor neurons on
   stretchable substrates. E15 spinal motor neurons were cultured on
   poly-lactide-co-glycolide films stretched at 4.8, 9.6, or 14.3
   mmday(-1). Morphological analysis revealed that substrate stretching has
   profound effects on developing motor neurons. Stretching increases major
   neurite length; it also forces neuritogenesis to occur nearest poles of
   the cell closest to the sources of tension. Stretching also reduces the
   number of neurites per neuron. These data show that substrate stretching
   affects neuronal morphology by specifying locations on the cell where
   neuritogenesis occurs and favoring major neurite growth at the expense
   of minor neurites. These results serve as a building block for
   development of new techniques to control and improve the growth of
   neurons for nerve repair purposes. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Volume = {{792}},
Pages = {{397-434}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A numerical analysis is presented of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
   (RTI) in the presence of an external electric field, with an emphasis on
   nonlinear phenomena associated with the evolution of complex interfacial
   morphology. The Poisson equation for the electric field and the
   Navier-Stokes equation for fluid flow field are solved simultaneously
   along with the Cahn-Hilliard phase field equation for interface
   deformation and morphology development. Numerical model is validated
   against the existing data and the results of linear analysis. Extensive
   numerical simulations are carried out for a wide range of fluid flow and
   electric field conditions. Computed results show that, in both linear
   and nonlinear regimes, a horizontal field suppresses the RTI, while a
   vertical electric field aggravates it. However, the vertical field does
   not affect the secondary instability; specifically, it does not
   contribute to the baroclinical generation of vorticity and consequently
   does not affect the roll-up formation. Linear analysis predicts that the
   RTI remains the same with the interchange of the dielectric constants of
   the two fluids, which is also confirmed by the numerical model for small
   interface deformations. This prediction, however, does not hold true in
   the nonlinear regimes in that complex interfacial morphology may evolve
   quite differently if the dielectric constants of two fluids are
   interchanged.}},

Abstract = {{In many physiological settings, microorganisms must swim through viscous
   fluids with suspended polymeric networks whose length scales are
   comparable to that of the organism. Here we present a model of a
   flagellar swimmer moving through a compliant viscoelastic network
   immersed in a three-dimensional viscous fluid. The swimmer moves with a
   prescribed gait, exerting forces on the fluid and the heterogeneous
   network. The viscoelastic structural links of this network are stretched
   or compressed in response to the fluid flow caused by these forces, and
   these elastic deformations also generate forces on the viscous fluid.
   Here we track the swimmer as it leaves a region of Newtonian fluid,
   enters and moves through a heterogeneous network and finally enters a
   Newtonian region again. We find that stiffer networks give a boost to
   the velocity of the swimmer. In addition, we find that the efficiency of
   swimming is dependent upon the evolution of the compliant network as the
   swimmer progresses through it.}},

Abstract = {{In a space frame, there exist in- and out-of-plane bending, axial, and
   torsional vibrations. The analysis of complex vibrations in such
   structures has relied mostly on numerical approaches. In this study, a
   wave-based analytical approach is applied to obtain solutions to
   vibrations in space frames. Both free and forced wave vibration
   responses are obtained, with bending vibrations modeled using the
   Timoshenko theory. A two-story steel space frame is built to validate
   the analytical results, and good agreements have been reached between
   the analytical and experimental studies. The effect of torsional
   rigidity adjustment on the accuracy of predicted vibrational responses
   in structures involving rotationally nonsymmetric cross sections is also
   examined.}},

Title = {{How personal task management differs across individuals}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{13-37}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{There has been a wealth of research on how individuals manage their
   tasks in general. However little to none has investigated whether, how,
   and why personal task management (PTM) behaviors differ across
   individuals. To fill this gap, we conducted two empirical studies: a
   focus group + contextual interviews with 19 participants, and an online
   survey with 178 respondents. Initially, based on the results of the
   first study, we were able to summarize the differences and similarities
   across the individuals by categorizing the participants into three
   categories: DIYers, make-doers, and adopters.
   Then, we conducted a survey with a broader population to assess to what
   extent our previous results would generalize to a broader population. We
   found that many of the survey respondents did not fit neatly into one of
   the previous categories; rather, they demonstrated tendencies of varying
   strength toward adopting, make-doing, and DIYing for their PTM. This was
   reflected in how they recorded and remembered their tasks, and if/how
   they maintained task lists. Based on this, we recommend that PTM tools
   have the capacity to accommodate the varying strengths of those
   tendencies: they should be personalizable so that people with DIY desire
   can personalize their tool when they need to and should be relatively
   effortless to use and integrate well with other systems in use to
   satisfy make-do tendencies. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Title = {{A novel domain overlapping strategy for the multiscale coupling of CFD
   with 1D system codes with applications to transient flows}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{422-432}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A novel multiscale coupling methodology based on a domain overlapping
   approach has been developed to couple a computational fluid dynamics
   code with a best-estimate thermal hydraulic code. The methodology has
   been implemented in the coupling infrastructure code Janus, developed at
   the University of Michigan, providing methods for the online data
   transfer between the commercial computational fluid dynamics code
   STAR-CCM+ and the US NRC best-estimate thermal hydraulic system code
   TRACE. Coupling between these two software packages is motivated by the
   desire to extend the range of applicability of TRACE to scenarios in
   which local momentum and energy transfer are important, such as
   three-dimensional mixing. These types of flows are relevant, for
   example, in the simulation of passive safety systems including large
   containment pools, or for flow mixing in the reactor pressure vessel
   downcomer of current light water reactors and integral small modular
   reactors. The intrafluid shear forces neglected by TRACE equations of
   motion are readily calculated from computational fluid dynamics
   solutions. Consequently, the coupling methods used in this study are
   built around correcting TRACE solutions with data from a corresponding
   STAR-CCM+ solution.
   Two coupling strategies are discussed in the paper: one based on a novel
   domain overlapping approach specifically designed for transient
   operation, and a second based on the well-known domain decomposition
   approach. In the present paper, we discuss the application of the two
   coupling methods to the simulation of open and closed loops in both
   steady state and transient operation. The objective of this study is to
   examine the performance of each coupling method in terms of convergence,
   consistency, and numerical stability.
   As expected, the results produced by the two methods were found to be
   identical once numerical convergence is achieved and consistent with the
   standalone STAR-CCM+ solution in both steady state and transient cases.
   However, the domain overlapping method was found to achieve convergence
   at larger integration time steps than the domain decomposition approach
   and exhibited superior convergence and numerical stability
   characteristics in both steady state and transient scenarios. (C) 2015

Title = {{Direct electrochemical oxidation of ethanol on SOFCs: Improved carbon
   tolerance of Ni anode by alloying}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{386-393}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are electrochemical devices that convert
   chemical energy in fuels into electrical energy through an
   electrochemical oxidation process. This technology is attractive since
   SOFCs can in principle utilize a range of combustible fuels including
   hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons offering higher efficiencies
   than conventional electricity generators with limited emission of a
   number of common air pollutants such as NOx and SOx. The environmental
   efficiency of SOFC devices can further be improved by utilizing fuels
   that are more carbon-neutral (e.g., biofuels such as ethanol) than
   conventional fossil fuels. One of the problems with employing oxygenated
   liquid biofuels is that conventional Ni anode electro-catalysts
   deactivate due to carbon deposition on the surface of the anode during
   the process of electocatalytic fuel oxidation. We show that the
   stability of Ni SOFC anode electrocatalysts during electrochemical
   oxidation of ethanol is significantly improved when a small amount of Sn
   is introduced in the electrocatalyst design. The improvement in the
   stability is manifested in a more stable operation and higher kinetic
   currents of Sn/Ni compared to Ni electrodes under identical conditions
   with ethanol fuel. We discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms
   responsible for the enhanced stability of the anodes and propose a
   number of guiding principles for the design of carbon-tolerant anodes
   for oxidation of oxygenated hydrocarbons. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Atypical chemokine receptor CXCR7 (ACKR3) functions as a scavenger
   receptor for chemokine CXCL12, a molecule that promotes multiple steps
   in tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer and multiple other
   malignancies. Although normal vascular endothelium expresses low levels
   of CXCR7, marked upregulation of CXCR7 occurs in tumor vasculature in
   breast cancer and other tumors. To investigate effects of endothelial
   CXCR7 in breast cancer, we conditionally deleted this receptor from
   vascular endothelium of adult mice, generating CXCR7(Delta END/Delta
   END) animals. CXCR7(Delta END/Delta END) mice appeared phenotypically
   normal, although these animals exhibited a modest 35 +/- 3\% increase in
   plasma CXCL12 as compared with control. Using two different syngeneic,
   orthotopic tumor implant models of breast cancer, we discovered that
   CXCR7(Delta END/Delta END) mice had significantly greater local
   recurrence of cancer following resection, elevated numbers of
   circulating tumor cells and more spontaneous metastases. CXCR7(Delta
   END/Delta END) mice also showed greater experimental metastases
   following intracardiac injection of cancer cells. These results
   establish that endothelial CXCR7 limits breast cancer metastasis at
   multiple steps in the metastatic cascade, advancing understanding of
   CXCL12 pathways in tumor environments and informing ongoing drug
   development targeting CXCR7 in cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid crystalline polymers have recently been engineered to exhibit
   complex macroscopic shape adaptivity, including optically- and thermally
   driven bending, self-sustaining oscillation, torsional motion, and
   three-dimensional folding. Miniaturization of these novel materials is
   of great interest for both fundamental study of processing conditions
   and for the development of shape-changing microdevices. Here, we present
   a scalable method for high-fidelity replica molding of glassy liquid
   crystalline polymer networks (LCNs), by vacuum-assisted replica molding,
   along with magnetic field-induced control of the molecular alignment. We
   find that an oxygen-free environment is essential to establish
   high-fidelity molding with low surface roughness. Identical arrays of
   homeotropic and polydomain LCN microstructures are fabricated to assess
   the influence of molecular alignment on the elastic modulus (E = 1.48
   GPa compared to E = 0.54 GPa), and side-view imaging is used to quantify
   the reversible thermal actuation of individual LCN micropillars by
   high-resolution tracking of edge motion. The methods and results from
   this study will be synergistic with future advances in liquid
   crystalline polymer chemistry, and could enable the scalable
   manufacturing of stimuli-responsive surfaces for applications including
   microfluidics, tunable optics, and surfaces with switchable wetting and
   adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated sustainability metrics provide an enriched set of information
   to inform decision-making. However, such approaches are rarely used to
   assess product supply chains. In this work, four integrated metrics
   presented in terms of land, resources, value added, and stability-are
   applied in a life cycle context, along with industrial process systems
   assessment and life cycle assessment, to evaluate Bounty paper towels
   from two manufacturing lines. The results show that the paper towels
   from the more state-of-the-art manufacturing line and newer facility are
   marginally more sustainable by the majority of environmental measures.
   Drivers of impacts from land use, resource use, and externality costs in
   the product life cycle are largely in the supply chains for raw
   materials and energy. The integrated metrics point to greenhouse gases,
   criteria air pollutants, land used for pulpwood, and fossil fuel use as
   important emissions and resources to manage for improving the
   sustainability of paper towel production. The metrics employed help to
   reconcile contrasting results from the life cycle impact assessment,
   such as water and energy use impacts, and provide a reduced set of
   practical, yet comprehensive, information to inform product-related
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Multicellular tumor spheroids are powerful in vitro models to perform
   preclinical chemosensitivity assays. We compare different methodologies
   to generate tumor spheroids in terms of resultant spheroid morphology,
   cellular arrangement and chemosensitivity. We used two cancer cell lines
   (MCF7 and OVCAR8) to generate spheroids using i) hanging drop array
   plates; ii) liquid overlay on ultra-low attachment plates; iii) liquid
   overlay on ultra-low attachment plates with rotating mixing (nutator
   plates). Analysis of spheroid morphometry indicated that cellular
   compaction was increased in spheroids generated on nutator and hanging
   drop array plates. Collagen staining also indicated higher compaction
   and remodeling in tumor spheroids on nutator and hanging drop arrays
   compared to conventional liquid overlay. Consequently, spheroids
   generated on nutator or hanging drop plates had increased
   chemoresistance to cisplatin treatment (20-60\% viability) compared to
   spheroids on ultra low attachment plates (10-20\% viability). Lastly, we
   used a mathematical model to demonstrate minimal changes in oxygen and
   cisplatin diffusion within experimentally generated spheroids. Our
   results demonstrate that methods of tumor spheroid generation result in
   varied cellular arrangement and chemosensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{We present multimission observations of field-aligned currents, auroral
   oval, and magnetopause crossings during the 17 March 2015 magnetic
   storm. Dayside reconnection is expected to transport magnetic flux,
   strengthen field-aligned currents, lead to polar cap expansion and
   magnetopause erosion. Our multimission observations assemble evidence
   for all these manifestations. After a prolonged period of strongly
   southward interplanetary magnetic field, Swarm and AMPERE observe
   significant intensification of field-aligned currents. The dayside
   auroral oval, as seen by DMSP, appears as a thin arc associated with
   ongoing dayside reconnection. Both the field-aligned currents and the
   auroral arc move equatorward reaching as low as similar to 60 degrees
   magnetic latitude. Strong magnetopause erosion is evident in the in situ
   measurements of the magnetopause crossings by GOES 13/15 and MMS. The
   coordinated Swarm, AMPERE, DMSP, MMS and GOES observations, with both
   global and in situ coverage of the key regions, provide a clear
   demonstration of the effects of dayside reconnection on the entire
   magnetosphere.}},

Abstract = {{We assess the consistency of the satellite-based observations of upper
   tropospheric water vapor (UTWV) by comparing brightness temperature
   measurements from the channel 12 of High-Resolution Infrared Radiation
   Sounder (HIRS), the 183.311GHz channel of Advanced Microwave Sounding
   Unit-B (AMSU-B)/Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS), and spectral radiances
   from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). All three products exhibit
   consistent spatial and temporal patterns of interannual variability. On
   decadal time scales, the spatial patterns of trends are similar between
   all three products; however, the amplitude of the regional trends is
   noticeably weaker in the HIRS measurements than in either the AMSU-B/MHS
   or AIRS data. This presumably reflects the greater clear-sky sampling
   limitations of HIRS relative to the other products. However, when
   averaged over tropical or near-global spatial scales, the trends between
   all three products are statistically indistinguishable from each other.
   The overall consistency between all three products provides important
   verification of their credibility for documenting long-term changes in
   UTWV. A similar analysis is performed for reanalysis-produced and
   model-simulated UTWV using the HIRS record as a benchmark. On decadal
   time scales, both reanalysis data sets and the multimodel ensemble mean
   have difficulty in capturing the observed moistening of climatologically
   dry regions of the subtropics, although the model-simulated trends are
   more consistent with the HIRS measurements than the reanalysis data.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{514}},
Pages = {{35-42}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{Two high-activity supported-Pd catalysts (Pd/V2O5/TiO2/SBA-15 and
   Pd/V2O5/TiO2/MCM-41) for selective catalytic reduction of NO with H-2
   were studied. They differ only by the mesoporous-silica support: SBA-15
   vs. MCM-41. Although the SBA-15 supported catalyst had a lower surface
   area, it showed a higher NO conversion (95\% vs. 84\%, at a high space
   velocity of 4.6 x 10(4) 1/h). Two pieces of direct and related evidence
   are shown for the role of hydrogen spillover in enhancing the catalytic
   activities of these two catalysts. A comparison of hydrogen adsorption
   isotherms (via the Benson-Boudart method) show more spillover on the
   SBA-15 supported catalyst. The results from the transient kinetics
   experiments also showed that the amount of spiltover hydrogen stored on
   the Pd/V2O5/TiO2/SBA-15 under dynamic reaction conditions was
   significantly higher than that on Pd/V2O5/TiO2/MCM-41 (7.3 mu mol/g vs.
   2.1 mu mol/g). Catalytic performance of the two catalysts for practical
   applications is reported. The favorable effect of hydrogen spillover on
   H-2-SCR could be used as a new strategy for improving the performance of
   noble-metal H2-SCR catalysts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Shear-coupled grain boundary migration assisted by unusual atomic
   shuffling}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Shear-coupled grain boundary (GB) migration can be an efficacious
   mechanism to accommodate plastic deformation when the grain size of
   polycrystalline materials goes small. Nevertheless, how this kind of GB
   motion comes into play at the atomic level has not been fully revealed.
   Here, we have investigated the shear-coupled migration (SCM) of typical
   {[}100] group symmetrical tilt GBs in bcc W using atomistic simulations.
   Depending on GB character, the SCM is found to proceed via dislocation
   slipping in the < 100 > or < 110 > mode with striking shear strength
   difference between them. We demonstrate that there exists an unusual
   atomic shuffling along the tilt axis, which greatly assists SCM to
   operate in the easier < 110 > mode instead of the < 100 > one. The
   present results highlight the significant role of GB character in the
   atomistic SCM process and contribute to the future design and
   fabrication of high-performance materials in GB engineering.}},

Title = {{Partially reduced graphene oxide based FRET on fiber-optic
   interferometer for biochemical detection}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Fluorescent resonance energy transfer ( FRET) with naturally exceptional
   selectivity is a powerful technique and widely used in chemical and
   biomedical analysis. However, it is still challenging for conventional
   FRET to perform as a high sensitivity compact sensor. Here we propose a
   novel `FRET on Fiber' concept, in which a partially reduced graphene
   oxide (prGO) film is deposited on a fiber-optic modal interferometer,
   acting as both the fluorescent quencher for the FRET and the sensitive
   cladding for optical phase measurement due to refractive index changes
   in biochemical detection. The target analytes induced fluorescence
   recovery with good selectivity and optical phase shift with high
   sensitivity are measured simultaneously. The functionalized prGO film
   coated on the fiber-optic interferometer shows high sensitivities for
   the detections of metal ion, dopamine and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA),
   with detection limits of 1.2 nM, 1.3 mu M and 1 pM, respectively. Such a
   prGO based `FRET on fiber' configuration, bridging the FRET and the
   fiber-optic sensing technology, may serve as a platform for the
   realization of series of integrated `FRET on Fiber' sensors for on-line
   environmental, chemical, and biomedical detection, with excellent
   compactness, high sensitivity, good selectivity and fast response}},

Abstract = {{Exercise has long-lasting benefits to bone health that may help prevent
   fractures by increasing bone mass, bone strength, and tissue quality.
   Long-term exercise of 6-12 weeks in rodents increases bone mass and bone
   strength. However, in growing mice, a short-term exercise program of 3
   weeks can limit increases in bone mass and structural strength, compared
   to non-exercised controls. Short-term exercise can, however, increase
   tissue strength, suggesting that exercise may create competition for
   minerals that favors initially improving tissue-level properties over
   structural-level properties. It was therefore hypothesized that adding
   calcium and phosphorus supplements to the diet may prevent decreases in
   bonemass and structural strength during a short-term exercise program,
   while leading to greater bone mass and structural strength than exercise
   alone after a long-term exercise program. A short-term exercise
   experiment was done for 3 weeks, and a long-term exercise experiment was
   done for 8 weeks. For each experiment, male 16-week old C57BL/6 mice
   were assigned to 4 weight-matched groups-exercise and non-exercise
   groups fed a control or mineral-supplemented diet. Exercise consisted of
   treadmill running at 12 m/min, 30 min/day for 7 days/week. After 3
   weeks, exercised mice fed the supplemented diet had significantly
   increased tibial tissue mineral content (TMC) and cross-sectional area
   over exercised mice fed the control diet. After 8 weeks, tibial TMC,
   cross-sectional area, yield force, and ultimate force were greater from
   the combined treatments than from either exercise or supplemented diet
   alone. Serum markers of bone formation (PINP) and resorption (CTX) were
   both decreased by exercise on day 2. In exercised mice, day 2 PINP was
   significantly positively correlated with day 2 serum Ca, a correlation
   that was weaker and negative in non-exercised mice. Increasing dietary
   mineral consumption during an exercise program increases bonemass after
   3 weeks and increases structural strength after 8 weeks, making bones
   best able to resist fracture.}},

Abstract = {{Scaffold design incorporating multiscale cues for clinically relevant,
   aligned tissue regeneration has potential to improve structural and
   functional integrity of multitissue interfaces. The objective of this
   preclinical study is to develop poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds
   with mesoscale and microscale architectural cues specifi c to human
   ligament progenitor cells and assess their ability to form aligned
   bone-ligament-cementum complexes in vivo. PCL scaffolds are designed to
   integrate a 3D printed bone region with a micropatterned PCL thin fi lm
   consisting of grooved pillars. The patterned fi lm region is seeded with
   human ligament cells, fi broblasts transduced with bone morphogenetic
   protein-7 genes seeded within the bone region, and a tooth dentin
   segment positioned on the ligament region prior to subcutaneous
   implantation into a murine model. Results indicate increased tissue
   alignment in vivo using micropatterned PCL fi lms, compared to
   random-porous PCL. At week 6, 30 mu m groove depth signifi cantly
   enhances oriented collagen fi ber thickness, overall cell alignment, and
   nuclear elongation relative to 10 MU m groove depth. This study
   demonstrates for the fi rst time that scaffolds with combined
   hierarchical mesoscale and microscale features can align cells in vivo
   for oral tissue repair with potential for improving the regenerative
   response of other bone-ligament complexes.}},

Abstract = {{The functions of anti-fouling, zwitterionic polycarboxybetaine (pCB)
   coating, and anti-platelet nitric oxide (NO) release replicate key
   anticoagulant properties of the endothelium. The two approaches, only
   tested separately thus far, are paired on gas permeable
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes and evaluated for fibrinogen (Fg)
   and platelet adsorption. Uncoated (control) and pCB-coated PDMS separate
   sheep plasma (10(8) platelets per milliliter) and gas flow chambers
   within bioreactors used in this study, and either 100 or 0 ppm of NO/N-2
   flows through the gas chamber so PDMS transfers NO into flowing plasma.
   Surface-adsorbed platelets are quantified using a lactate dehydrogenase
   assay after 8h plasma recirculation. Fg and platelet adsorption on
   pCB-coated PDMS are 10.40\% +/- 3.0\% of control (p < 0.01) and 23.3\%
   +/- 7.4\% (p < 0.01) of control, respectively. NO flux alone limits
   platelet adsorption to 79.0\% +/- 5.0\% (p < 0.05) of control. Together,
   NO and pCB reduce platelet adsorption to 6.90\% +/- 1.30\% of control (p
   < 0.001). The data suggest that pCB coating and NO act in concert to
   reduce platelet fouling at significantly higher levels than either pCB
   coating or NO release alone.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the thermal stability of electrical properties in
   ternary alloy (YxSc1-x)(2)O-3 high-k oxides as a function of yttrium
   fraction, x. The yttrium-scandium oxide dielectric films are deposited
   using a facile ink-based process. The oxides have a
   stoichiometry-dependent relative dielectric constant of 26.0 to 7.7 at
   100 kHz, low leakage current density of 10(-8) A.cm(-2), high breakdown
   field of 4 MV.cm(-1), and interface trap density of 10(12) cm(-2).eV(-1)
   with silicon. Compared with binary oxides, ternary alloys exhibit less
   frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant and a higher
   crystallization temperature. After crystallization is induced through a
   900 degrees C anneal, ternary (Y0.6Sc0.4)(2)O-3 films maintain their low
   leakage current and high breakdown field. In contrast, the electrical
   performance of the binary oxides significantly degrades following the
   same treatment. The solution-processed ternary oxide dielectrics
   demonstrated here may be used as high-k gate insulators in complementary
   metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies, in novel electronic
   material systems and devices, and in printed, flexible thin film
   electronics, and as passivation layers for high power devices. These
   oxides may also be used as insulators in fabrication process flows that

   of the existence of the uni-directionality property is found. We show
   that the band of edge states is always finite with massless excitations,
   while the spectrum of the bulk states, depending on the parameters of
   the barrier, may consist of the infinite or finite band with both,
   massive and massless, low-energy excitations. The effect of the Zeeman
   term is considered and the condition of the appearance of two distinct
   energy-dependent directions corresponding to the Klein tunneling is
   found.}},

Title = {{Repositioning Clofazimine as a Macrophage-Targeting Photoacoustic
   Contrast Agent}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT) is a deep-tissue imaging modality, with
   potential clinical applications in the diagnosis of arthritis, cancer
   and other disease conditions. Here, we identified Clofazimine (CFZ), a
   red-pigmented dye and anti-inflammatory FDA-approved drug, as a
   macrophage-targeting photoacoustic (PA) imaging agent. Spectroscopic
   experiments revealed that CFZ and its various protonated forms yielded
   optimal PAT signals at wavelengths -450 to 540 nm. CFZ's
   macrophage-targeting chemical and structural forms were detected with PA
   microscopy at a high contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR > 22 dB) as well as
   with macroscopic imaging using synthetic gelatin phantoms. In vivo,
   natural and synthetic CFZ formulations also demonstrated significant
   anti-inflammatory activity. Finally, the injection of CFZ was monitored
   via a real-time ultrasound-photoacoustic (US-PA) dual imaging system in
   a live animal and clinically relevant human hand model. These results
   demonstrate an anti-inflammatory drug repurposing strategy, while
   identifying a new PA contrast agent with potential applications in the
   diagnosis and treatment of arthritis.}},

Title = {{The effects of attractive vs. repulsive instructional cuing on balance
   performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Torso-based vibrotactile feedback has been shown to improve
   postural performance during quiet and perturbed stance in healthy young
   and older adults and individuals with balance impairments. These systems
   typically include tactors distributed around the torso that are
   activated when body motion exceeds a predefined threshold. Users are
   instructed to ``move away from the vibration{''}. However, recent
   studies have shown that in the absence of instructions, vibrotactile
   stimulation induces small (similar to 1 degrees) non-volitional
   responses in the direction of its application location. It was
   hypothesized that an attractive cuing strategy (i.e., ``move toward the
   vibration{''}) could improve postural performance by leveraging this
   natural tendency.
   Findings: Eight healthy older adults participated in two non-consecutive
   days of computerized dynamic posturography testing while wearing a
   vibrotactile feedback system comprised of an inertial measurement unit
   and four tactors that were activated in pairs when body motion exceeded
   1 degrees anteriorly or posteriorly. A crossover design was used. On
   each day participants performed 24 repetitions of Sensory Organization
   Test condition 5 (SOT5), three repetitions each of SOT 1-6, three
   repetitions of the Motor Control Test, and five repetitions of the
   Adaptation Test. Performance metrics included A/P RMS, Time-in-zone and
   95 \% CI Ellipse. Performance improved with both cuing strategies but
   participants performed better when using repulsive cues. However, the
   rate of improvement was greater for attractive versus repulsive cuing.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that when the cutaneous signal is
   interpreted as an alarm, cognition overrides sensory information.
   Furthermore, although repulsive cues resulted in better performance,
   attractive cues may be as good, if not better, than repulsive cues
   following extended training.}},

Abstract = {{This Letter presents an innovative design of an electro-optical
   modulator using germanium telluride (GeTe) phase change material with an
   integrated nano-heater. The refractive index and the electrical
   conductivity of GeTe significantly change as the GeTe goes though the
   crystallographic phase change. Amorphization and crystallization of GeTe
   is achieved using the Joule heating method by passing current through an
   array of metal gratings, where GeTe fills the slits between the metal
   lines. These metal slits also increase the contrast between the
   amorphous (on) and crystalline (off) phases of the modulator by having
   extraordinary transmission and reflection response based on interactions
   of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) with the incoming light. The
   modulator is designed for 1550 nm wavelength, where GeTe is transparent
   in the amorphous phase and provides high optical on/off contrast. The
   metal-insulator-metal (MIM) is designed in such a way to only support
   SPP excitation when GeTe is crystalline and slit resonance when it is
   amorphous to increase the modulation index. The modulator is stable in
   both phases with higher than 12 dB change in transmission with zero
   static power consumption at room temperature. (C) 2016 Optical Society

Title = {{Extracellular matrix mediators of metastatic cell colonization

Abstract = {{Metastatic tumor cells colonize the pre-metastatic niche, which is a
   complex microenvironment consisting partially of extracellular matrix
   (ECM) proteins. We sought to identify and validate novel contributors to
   tumor cell colonization using ECM-coated poly(epsilon-caprolactone)
   (PCL) scaffolds as mimics of the pre metastatic niche. Utilizing
   orthotopic breast cancer mouse models, fibronectin and collagen
   IV-coated scaffolds implanted in the subcutaneous space captured
   colonizing tumor cells, showing a greater than 2-fold increase in tumor
   cell accumulation at the implant site compared to uncoated scaffolds. As
   a strategy to identify additional ECM colonization contributors,
   decellularized matrix (DCM) from lungs and livers containing metastatic
   tumors were characterized. In vitro, metastatic cell adhesion was
   increased on DCM coatings from diseased organs relative to healthy DCM.
   Furthermore, in vivo implantations of diseased DCM-coated scaffolds had
   increased tumor cell colonization relative to healthy DCM coatings.
   Mass-spectrometry proteomics was performed on healthy and diseased DCM
   to identify candidates associated with colonization. Myeloperoxidase was
   identified as abundantly present in diseased organs and validated as a
   contributor to colonization using myeloperoxidase-coated scaffold
   implants. This work identified novel ECM proteins associated with
   colonization using decellularization and proteomics techniques and
   validated candidates using a scaffold to mimic the pre-metastatic niche.
   Statement of Significance
   The pre-metastatic niche consists partially of ECM proteins that promote
   metastatic cell colonization to a target organ. We present a
   biomaterials-based approach to mimic this niche and identify ECM
   mediators of colonization. Using murine breast cancer models, we
   implanted microporous PCL scaffolds to recruit colonizing tumor cells in
   vivo. As a strategy to modulate colonization, we coated scaffolds with
   various ECM proteins, including decellularized lung and liver matrix
   from tumor-bearing mice. After characterizing the organ matrices using
   proteomics, myeloperoxidase was identified as an ECM protein
   contributing to colonization and validated using our scaffold. Our
   scaffold provides a platform to identify novel contributors to
   colonization and allows for the capture of colonizing tumor cells for a
   variety of downstream clinical applications. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia

Title = {{Nanofibrous spongy microspheres for the delivery of hypoxia-primed human
   dental pulp stem cells to regenerate vascularized dental pulp}},

Abstract = {{Dental pulp infection and necrosis are widespread diseases. Conventional
   endodontic treatments result in a devitalized and weakened tooth. In
   this work, we synthesized novel star-shaped polymer to self assemble
   into unique nanofibrous spongy microspheres (NF-SMS), which were used to
   carry human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) into the pulp cavity to
   regenerate living dental pulp tissues. It was found that NF-SMS
   significantly enhanced hDPSCs attachment, proliferation, odontogenic
   differentiation and angiogenesis, as compared to control cell carriers.
   Additionally, NF-SMS promoted vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
   expression of hDPSCs in a 3D hypoxic culture. Hypoxia-primed
   hDPSCs/NF-SMS complexes were injected into the cleaned pulp cavities of
   rabbit molars for subcutaneous implantation in mice. After 4 weeks, the
   hypoxia group significantly enhanced angiogenesis inside the pulp
   chamber and promoted the formation of ondontoblast-like cells lining
   along the dentin pulp interface, as compared to the control groups
   (hDPSCs alone group, NF-SMS alone group, and hDPSCsiNF-SMS group
   pre-cultured under normoxic conditions). Furthermore, in an in situ
   dental pulp repair model in rats, hypoxia-primed hDPSCsiNF-SMS were
   injected to fully fill the pulp cavity and regenerate pulp-like tissues
   with a rich vasculature and a histological structure similar to the
   native pulp.
   Statement of Significance
   Vascularization is key to the regeneration of many vital tissues.
   However, it is challenging to create a suitable microenvironment for
   stem cells to regenerate vascularized tissue structure. This manuscript
   reports a novel star-shaped block copolymer that self-assembles into
   unique nanofibrous spongy microspheres, which as an injectable scaffold
   recapitulate the cell cell and cell matrix interactions in development.
   Using a clinically-relevant surgical procedure and a hypoxic treatment,
   the nanofibrous spongy micro spheres were used to deliver stem cells and
   successfully regenerate dental pulp with a rich vasculature and a
   complex histologic structure similar to that of the native dental pulp.
   The novel microspheres can likely be used to regenerate many other
   vascularized tissues. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as estrogens, is
   a growing issue for human and animal health as they have been shown to
   cause reproductive and developmental abnormalities in wildlife and
   plants and have been linked to male infertility disorders in humans.
   Intensive farming and weather events, such as storms, flash, flooding,
   and landslides, contribute estrogen to waterways used to Supply drinking
   water. This paper explores the impact of estrogen exposure on the
   performance of slow sand filters (SSFs) used for water treatment. The
   feasibility and efficacy of SSF bioaugmentation with estrogen-degrading
   bacteria was also investigated, to-determine whether removal of natural
   estrogens (estrone, estradiol, and estriol) and overall SSF performarice
   for drinking water treatment could be improved. Strains for SSF
   augmentation were isolated from full-scale, municipal SSFs so as to
   optimize:survival the laboratory-scale SSFs used. concentrations of the
   natural estrogens, determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS), revealed augmented SSFs reduced the overall
   estrogenic potency of the supplied water by 25\% On average and removed
   significantly more estrone and estradiol than nonaugmented filters. A
   negative correlation was found between coliform removal and estrogen
   concentration in nonaugmented filters. This was dire to the toxic
   inhibition of protozoa:indicating that high estrogen concentrations can
   have functional implications for SSFs (such as impairing coliform.
   removal). Consequently, we suggest that high estrogen concentrations
   could impact:significantly on water quality production and, in
   particular, on pathogen removal in biological water filters.}},

Abstract = {{Heart attack is a life threaten cardiac disease. Although advances in

   critical concern for practical usage. However, there have been not many
   studies focusing on energy consumption of mobile ECG monitoring,
   especially lacking guidelines in selecting proper data communication
   strategies and computational algorithms. In this paper, we examine three
   possible modes of data transmissions for energy consumption. A generic
   energy consumption model and a simulated environment were developed to
   examine the influence of different communication strategies and
   ventricular fibrillation detection methods in terms of computational
   efficiency and power consumption. This paper shows that the total ratio
   of energy saving between mode transmitting all data and our proposed
   event transmission is up to 84.67\% per 508 s of data segment.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of drying condition on the formation of Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 was
   investigated and the NO oxidation efficiency over them was evaluated.
   These catalysts were investigated in detail by means of X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), High resolution transmission electron microscope
   (HR-TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and NO(O-2) Temperature-programmed
   desorption (NO(O-2)-TPD). The results demonstrated that the slow drying
   rate caused by the decrease of the temperature and the use of the vacuum
   benefited for more Zr doped into CeO2 lattice and hence generated more
   Ce3+ on the surface, thus benefitting for the adsorption amount of O-2.
   TEM results display the special morphology of the catalysts, which
   prepared under the conditions of slow drying rate. Gas-cell in-situ STEM
   confirms that the slow drying rate and the nature of the solvent made
   the particles growing along the (111) facet and finally displayed the
   coralloid particles. The coralloid catalysts prepared at the low drying
   temperature in the vacuum oven exhibited the highest NO oxidation
   efficiency, which reached 50.54\% at 350 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{In this letter, the authors present results of an experimental
   investigation demonstrating how extreme persistent thermal cycling
   influences the performance of piezoelectric macro fiber composite (MFC)
   actuators. More specifically, this research shows how repeated
   temperature cycling ranging from -60 degrees C to 90 degrees C and from
   -50 degrees C to 150 degrees C affects an MFCs ability to actuate while
   being driven at frequencies of 60Hz to 90Hz with a voltage of 20 V-pp.
   Experimental results show that thermal cycling causes MFC actuation
   characteristics to drift and eventually stabilize after approximately 20
   cycles. In two cases presented here, thermal cycling alone caused a
   residual increase in actuation amplitude that exceeded the initial
   amplitude by 70\%. This apparent thermal memory effect of MFCs may
   significantly impact the design and analysis of active structures where
   MFCs are used for vibration or displacement control in transient extreme
   temperature environments such as those encountered by aerospace
   structures, industrial equipment, automobiles, and civil infrastructure.

Abstract = {{A set of state-specific transition rates for each rovibrational level is
   generated for the O-2(X3 Sigma(-)(g))-O(P-3) system using the
   quasi-classical trajectory method at temperatures observed in hypersonic
   flows. A system of master equations describes the relaxation of the
   rovibrational ensemble to thermal equilibrium under ideal heat bath
   conditions at a constant translational temperature. Vibrational and
   rotational relaxation times, obtained from the average internal
   energies, exhibit a pattern inherent in a chemically reactive
   collisional pair. An intrinsic feature of the O-3 molecular system with
   a large attractive potential is a weak temperature dependence of the
   rovibrational transition rates. For this reason, the quasi-steady
   vibrational and rotational temperatures experience a maximum at
   increasing translational temperature. The energy rate coefficients, that
   characterize the average loss of internal energy due to dissociation,
   quickly diminish at high temperatures, compared to other molecular
   systems. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Coherent Polariton Laser}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW X}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR 11}},
Abstract = {{The semiconductor polariton laser promises a new source of coherent
   light, which, compared to conventional semiconductor photon lasers, has
   input-energy threshold orders of magnitude lower. However, intensity
   stability, a defining feature of a coherent state, has remained poor.
   Intensity noise many times the shot noise of a coherent state has
   persisted, attributed to multiple mechanisms that are difficult to
   separate in conventional polariton systems. The large intensity noise,
   in turn, limits the phase coherence. Thus, the capability of the
   polariton laser as a source of coherence light is limited. Here, we
   demonstrate a polariton laser with shot-noise-limited intensity
   stability, as expected from a fully coherent state. This stability is
   achieved by using an optical cavity with high mode selectivity to
   enforce single-mode lasing, suppress condensate depletion, and establish
   gain saturation. Moreover, the absence of spurious intensity
   fluctuations enables the measurement of a transition from exponential to
   Gaussian decay of the phase coherence of the polariton laser. It
   suggests large self-interaction energies in the polariton condensate,
   exceeding the laser bandwidth. Such strong interactions are unique to
   matter-wave lasers and important for nonlinear polariton devices. The
   results will guide future development of polariton lasers and nonlinear
   polariton devices.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS}},

Volume = {{819}},

Abstract = {{The nature of the icy material accreted by comets during their formation
   in the outer regions of the protosolar nebula (PSN) is a major open
   question in planetary science. Some scenarios of comet formation predict
   that these bodies agglomerated from crystalline ices condensed in the
   PSN. Concurrently, alternative scenarios suggest that comets accreted
   amorphous ice originating from the interstellar cloud or from the very
   distant regions of the PSN. On the basis of existing laboratory and
   modeling data, we find that the N-2/CO and Ar/CO ratios measured in the
   coma of the Jupiter-family comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the
   Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis instrument on.
   board the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft match those
   predicted for gases trapped in clathrates. If these measurements are
   representative of the bulk N-2/CO and Ar/CO ratios in
   67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, it implies that the ices accreted by the
   comet formed in the nebula and do not originate from the interstellar
   medium, supporting the idea that the building blocks of outer solar
   system bodies have been formed from clathrates and possibly from pure
   crystalline ices. Moreover, because 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is
   impoverished in Ar and N-2, the volatile enrichments observed in
   Jupiter's atmosphere cannot be explained solely via the accretion of
   building blocks with similar compositions and require an additional
   delivery source. A potential source may be the accretion of gas from the
   nebula that has been progressively enriched in heavy elements due to
   photoevaporation.}},

Title = {{Cortical Spectral Activity and Connectivity during Active and Viewed Arm
   and Leg Movement}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Active and viewed limb movement activate many similar neural pathways,
   however, to date most comparison studies have focused on subjects making
   small, discrete movements of the hands and feet. The purpose of this
   study was to determine if high-density electroencephalography (EEG)
   could detect differences in cortical activity and connectivity during
   active and viewed rhythmic arm and leg movements in humans. Our primary
   hypothesis was that we would detect similar but weaker electrocortical
   spectral fluctuations and effective connectivity fluctuations during
   viewed limb exercise compared to active limb exercise due to the
   similarities in neural recruitment. A secondary hypothesis was that we
   would record stronger cortical spectral fluctuations for arm exercise
   compared to leg exercise, because rhythmic arm exercise would be more
   dependent on supraspinal control than rhythmic leg exercise. We recorded
   EEG data while ten young healthy subjects exercised on a recumbent
   stepper with: (1) both arms and legs, (2) just legs, and (3) just arms.
   Subjects also viewed video playback of themselves or another individual
   performing the same exercises. We performed independent component
   analysis, dipole fitting, spectral analysis, and effective connectivity
   analysis on the data. Cortical areas comprising the premotor and
   supplementary motor cortex, the anterior cingulate, the posterior
   cingulate, and the parietal cortex exhibited significant spectral
   fluctuations during rhythmic limb exercise. These fluctuations tended to
   be greater for the arms exercise conditions than for the legs only
   exercise condition, which suggests that human rhythmic arm movements are
   under stronger cortical control than rhythmic leg movements. We did not
   find consistent spectral fluctuations in these areas during the viewed
   conditions, but effective connectivity fluctuated at harmonics of the
   exercise frequency during both active and viewed rhythmic limb exercise.
   The right premotor and supplementary motor cortex drove the network.
   These results suggest that a similarly interconnected neural network is
   in operation during active and viewed human rhythmic limb movement.}},

Title = {{Biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres loaded with
   S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D-penicillamine for controlled nitric oxide delivery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) is a fascinating and important endogenous free-radical
   gas with potent antimicrobial, vasodilating, smooth muscle relaxant, and
   growth factor stimulating effects. However, its wider biomedical
   applicability is hindered by its cumbersome administration, since NO is
   unstable especially in biological environments. In this work, to
   ultimately develop site-specific controlled release vehicles for NO, the
   NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D-penicillamine (SNAP) was encapsulated
   within poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) 50:50 (PLGA) microspheres by using
   a solid-in-oil-in-water emulsion solvent evaporation method. The highest
   payload was 0.56(+/- 0.01) mu mol SNAP/mg microspheres. The in vitro
   release kinetics of the donor were controlled by the bioerosion of the
   PLGA microspheres. By using an uncapped PLGA (Mw = 24,000-38,000) SNAP
   was slowly released for over 10 days, whereas by using the ester capped
   PLGA (Mw = 38,000-54,000) the release lasted for over 4 weeks. The
   presence of copper ions and/or ascorbate in solution was necessary to
   efficiently decompose the released NO donor and obtain sustained NO
   release. Itwas also demonstrated that light can be used to induce rapid
   NO release from the microspheres over several hours. SNAP exhibited
   excellent storage stability when encapsulated in the PLGA microspheres.
   These new microsphere formulations may be useful for site-specific
   administration and treatment of pathologies associated with dysfunction
   in endogenous NO production, e.g. treatment of diabetic wounds, or in
   diseases involving other biological functions of NO including
   vasodilation, antimicrobial, anticancer, and neurotransmission. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A method is described for calculating the energetics of planar defects
   in alloys based on the special-quasirandom-structure (SQS) approach. We
   examine the accuracy of the approach employing atomistic calculations
   based on a classical embedded-atom-method (EAM) interatomic potential
   for hexagonal close packed (hcp) alloys, for which benchmark results can
   be obtained by direct configurational averaging. The results of these
   calculations demonstrate that the SQS-based approach can be employed to
   derive the concentration dependence of the energies of twin boundaries,
   unstable stacking faults, and surfaces to within an accuracy of
   approximately 10\%. The SQS considered in this study contain up to 72
   atoms and hence are small enough to be considered in first-principles
   density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculations. The application of
   the SQS-based approach in direct DFT-based calculations is demonstrated
   in a study of the concentration dependence of interfacial energies for
   \{11 (2) over bar1\} twins in hcp Ti-Al alloys.}},

Title = {{Theoretical Limiting Potentials in Mg/O-2 Batteries}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1390-1401}},
Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{A rechargeable battery based on a multivalent Mg/O-2 couple is an
   attractive chemistry due to its high theoretical batteries based on
   alkaline earth anodes have received limited energy density and potential
   for low cost. Nevertheless, metal-air attention and generally exhibit
   modest performance. In addition, many fundamental aspects of this system
   remain poorly understood, such as the reaction mechanisms associated
   with discharge and charging. The present study aims to close this
   knowledge gap and thereby accelerate the development of Mg/O-2 batteries
   by employing first-principles calculations to characterize
   electrochemical processes on the surfaces of likely discharge products,
   MgO and MgO2. Thermodynamic limiting potentials for charge and discharge
   are calculated for several scenarios, including variations in surface
   stoichiometry and the presence/absence of intermediate species in the
   reaction pathway. The calculations indicate that pathways involving
   oxygen intermediates are preferred, as they generally result in higher
   discharge and lower charging voltages. In agreement with recent
   experiments, cells that discharge to MgO exhibit low round-trip
   efficiencies, which are rationalized by the presence of large
   thermodynamic overvoltages. In contrast, MgO2-based cells are predicted
   to be much more efficient: superoxide-terminated facets on MgO2
   crystallites enable low overvoltages and round-trip efficiencies
   approaching 90\%. These data suggest that the performance of Mg/O-2
   batteries can be dramatically improved by biasing discharge toward the
   formation of MgO2 rather than MgO.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a photoacoustic lens with a low f-number of 0.61 and a
   high focal gain of 220 at 15-MHz frequency for laser-generated focused
   ultrasound (LGFU), which enables free-field micro-cavitation in water.
   Due to tight ultrasonic focusing (90 mu m in lateral and 200 mu m in
   longitudinal spot widths at a distance of 9.2 mm), the lens produces a
   peak pressure of 20 MPa (positive) using an input laser energy of only 1
   mJ/pulse (6-ns temporal width). Remarkably, we confirm single-pulsed
   micro-cavitation in a free-field condition by using this lens, which has
   not previously been achieved with LGFU. The free-field cavitation was
   monitored and characterized in terms of a bubble radius, a lifetime, and
   a probability. Our result demonstrates that LGFU amplitudes can be
   sufficiently higher than a threshold for free-field cavitation at a
   microscale spot, which is a crucial step for cavitation-based therapy
   with high precision. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafast mid-infrared (IR) coherent radiation plays an important role
   in strong-field physics, wherein the use of longer wavelengths has
   reduced the optical intensities needed to drive light-matter
   interactions by orders of magnitude in comparison to near-IR radiation.
   Optimizing parametric interactions for generation and characterization
   of mid-IR pulses is an enabling step for those applications. We report
   on the production of >50 mu J femtosecond pulses centered at 5 mu m in a
   two-stage optical parametric amplifier (OPA) based on ZnGeP2, a
   high-performance optical material in this spectral region. The OPA is
   pumped by an ultrafast 2-mu m source. Amplified pulses have been
   characterized by parametric upconversion, enabling the use of standard
   silicon detectors. A numerical model of the system has been developed
   and tested to control dispersion, group-velocity mismatch, and off-axis
   parametric fluorescence. The source architecture is suitable for
   production of mJ-level mid-IR ultrafast pulses without the use of
   chirped-pulse amplification, where convenient pumping could be realized
   directly by mid-IR laser sources based on materials such as Cr:ZnSe or
   Cr:ZnS. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A candidate drug compound is released for clinical trails (in vivo
   activity) only if its physicochemical properties meet desirable
   bioavailability and partitioning criteria. Amino acid side chain analogs
   play vital role in the functionalities of protein and peptides and as
   such are important in drug discovery. We demonstrate here that the
   predictions of solvation free energies in water, in 1-octanol, and
   self-solvation free energies computed using force field-based expanded
   ensemble molecular dynamics simulation provide good accuracy compared to
   existing empirical and semi-empirical methods. These solvation free
   energies are then, as shown here, used for the prediction of a wide
   range of physicochemical properties important in the assessment of
   bioavailability and partitioning of compounds. In particular, we
   consider here the vapor pressure, the solubility in both water and
   1-octanol, and the air-water, air-octanol, and octanol-water partition
   coefficients of amino acid side chain analogs computed from the
   solvation free energies. The calculated solvation free energies using
   different force fields are compared against each other and with
   available experimental data. The protocol here can also be used for a
   newly designed drug and other molecules where force field parameters and

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{An efficient phonovoltaic (pV) material requires a highly energetic
   optical phonon (E-p,E-O >> k(B)T) with linewidth dominated by the
   electron-phonon (e-p) coupling and resonant with its electronic band gap
   (Delta E-e,E-g), as discussed in Paper I {[}C. Melnick and M. Kaviany,
   Phys. Rev. B 93, 094302 (2016)]. No current material combines these
   properties. While graphite (graphene) has the former two, it lacks a
   band gap. Opening and tuning the band gap in graphite is challenging due
   to the stability of the Dirac point, e.g., under a uniaxial strain
   <0.25. We tune its band gap through partial hydrogenation using
   extensive ab initio calculations and find a stable graphame structure
   with Delta E-e,E-g similar or equal to E-p,E-O similar or equal to 200
   meV, C128H1x24. We calculate the e-p coupling in tuned C128H1x24 and
   graphene and show that the transition from pi-pi{*} (graphene) to
   sigma-sigma{*} (graphane) bands suppresses the electron-phonon coupling,
   such that optical phonons in C128H1x24 primarily downconvert, and it
   does not achieve a high figure of merit (Z(pV) < 0.1). Ab initio
   phonon-phonon couplings are calculated for graphane and graphene to
   support this result. Overall, we develop a material with E-p,E-O similar
   or equal to Delta E-e,E-g >> k(B)T and a method for tuning and
   evaluating pV materials.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{The phonovoltaic (pV) cell is similar to the photovoltaic. It harvests
   nonequilibrium (hot) optical phonons (E-p, O) more energetic than the
   band gap (Delta E-e,E- (g)) to generate power in a p-n junction. We
   examine the theoretical electron-phonon and phonon-phonon scattering
   rates, the Boltzmann transport of electrons, and the diode equation and
   hydrodynamic simulations to describe the operation of a pV cell and
   develop an analytic model predicting its efficiency. Our findings
   indicate that a pV material with E-p,E- O similar or equal to Delta
   E-e,E- g >> k(B)T, where k(B)T is the thermal energy, and a strong
   interband electron-phonon coupling surpasses the thermoelectric limit,
   provided the optical phonon population is excited in a nanoscale cell,
   enabling the ensuing local nonequilibrium. Finding and tuning amaterial
   with these properties is challenging. In Paper II {[}C. Melnick and M.
   Kaviany, Phys. Rev. B 93, 125203 (2016)], we tune the band gap of
   graphite within density functional theory through hydrogenation and the
   application of isotropic strains. The band gap is tuned to resonate with
   its energetic optical phonon modes and calculate the ab initio
   electron-phonon and phonon-phonon scattering rates. While hydrogenation
   degrades the strong electron-phonon coupling in graphene such that the
   figure of merit vanishes, we outline the methodology for a continued
   material search.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{874-881}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{A promising strategy for increasing the energy density of Li-ion
   batteries is to substitute a multivalent (MV) metal for the commonly
   used lithiated carbon anode. Magnesium is a prime candidate for such a
   MV battery due to its high volumetric capacity, abundance, and limited
   tendency to form dendrites. One challenge that is slowing the
   implementation of Mg-based batteries, however, is the development of
   efficient and stable electrolytes. Computational screening for molecular
   species having sufficiently wide electrochemical windows is a starting
   point for the identification of optimal electrolytes. Nevertheless, this
   window can be altered via interfacial interactions with electrodes.
   These interactions are typically omitted in screening studies, yet they
   have the potential to generate large shifts to the HOMO and LUMO of the
   electrolyte components. The present study quantifies the stability of
   several common electrolyte solvents on model electrodes of relevance for
   Mg batteries. Many-body perturbation theory calculations based on the
   G(0)W(0) method were used to predict shifts in a solvent's electronic
   levels arising from interfacial interactions. In molecules exhibiting
   large dipole moments, our calculations indicate that these interactions
   reduce the HOMO-LUMO gap by similar to 25\% (compared to isolated
   molecules). We conclude that electrode interactions can narrow an
   electrolyte's electrochemical window significantly, thereby accelerating
   redox decomposition reactions. Accounting for these interactions in
   screening studies presents an opportunity to refine predictions of
   electrolyte stability.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality
   worldwide. Current surgical treatments for cardiovascular disease
   include vascular bypass grafting and replacement with autologous blood
   vessels or synthetic vascular grafts. However, there is a call for
   better alternative biological grafts.
   Areas covered: Tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) are promising
   novel alternatives to replace diseased vessels. However, obtaining
   enough functional and clinically usable vascular cells for fabrication
   of TEVGs remains a major challenge. New findings in adult stem cells and
   recent advances in pluripotent stem cells have opened a new avenue for
   stem cell-based vascular engineering. In this review, recent advances on
   stem cell sourcing for TEVGs including the use of adult stem cells and
   pluripotent stem cells and advantages, disadvantages, and possible
   future implementations of different types of stem cells will be
   discussed. In addition, current strategies used during the fabrication
   of TEVGs will be highlighted.
   Expert opinion: The application of patient-specific TEVGs constructed
   with vascular cells derived from immune-compatible stem cells possesses
   huge clinical potential. Advances in lineage-specific differentiation
   approaches and innovative vascular engineering strategies will promote
   the vascular regeneration field from bench to bedside.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies start to explore the potential benefits of directly
   assimilating the radiance from the infrared imagers onboard
   geostationary satellites to the short-range numerical weather prediction
   both on the synoptic- and meso-scales, where accurate quantification of
   the bias and observation error arising from the numerical model and the
   instrument is a key component in such experiments. This paper
   investigates both the bias and the observation errors of the Stretched
   Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (S-VISSR) onboard Chinese
   operational geostationary satellite Fengyun-2F, as the first step
   towards its clear-sky radiance assimilation. In this study, 774,530
   observations that passed a five-step quality control procedure during
   the period of 1-7 July in 2014 are collected to investigate the
   mentioned two quantities while the synthetic simulated clear radiance is
   calculated through a numerical weather prediction model and a radiative
   transfer model. Persistent warm biases are found for FY-2F S-VISSR
   channel 3, 4 and 5 during day and night, and they are possibly due to
   the uncertainty from the instrument calibration process. The observation
   errors of S-VISSR infrared channels vary with the surface types,
   generally with larger values over land than over ocean, which could
   partially be explained by the variation of the land types over land.
   Besides, whether these biases change with viewing geometry or evolve
   with time is also examined in our study. Biases from the three surface
   channels exhibit complex dependence on the scan position and evolve with
   time, which encourages incorporating both the scan position and temporal
   corrections into the S-VISSR bias correction scheme in the data
   assimilation system.}},

Abstract = {{Objective ClinicalTrials.gov serves critical functions of disseminating
   trial information to the public and helping the trials recruit
   participants. This study assessed the readability of trial descriptions
   at ClinicalTrials.gov using multiple quantitative measures.
   Materials and Methods The analysis included all 165 988 trials
   registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as of April 30, 2014. To obtain
   benchmarks, the authors also analyzed 2 other medical corpora: (1) all
   955 Health Topics articles from MedlinePlus and (2) a random sample of
   100 000 clinician notes retrieved from an electronic health records
   system intended for conveying internal communication among medical
   professionals. The authors characterized each of the corpora using 4
   surface metrics, and then applied 5 different scoring algorithms to
   assess their readability. The authors hypothesized that clinician notes
   would be most difficult to read, followed by trial descriptions and
   MedlinePlus Health Topics articles.
   Results Trial descriptions have the longest average sentence length
   (26.1 words) across all corpora; 65\% of their words used are not
   covered by a basic medical English dictionary. In comparison, average
   sentence length of MedlinePlus Health Topics articles is 61\% shorter,
   vocabulary size is 95\% smaller, and dictionary coverage is 46\% higher.
   All 5 scoring algorithms consistently rated CliniclTrials.gov trial
   descriptions the most difficult corpus to read, even harder than
   clinician notes. On average, it requires 18 years of education to
   properly understand these trial descriptions according to the results
   generated by the readability assessment algorithms.
   Discussion and Conclusion Trial descriptions at CliniclTrials.gov are
   extremely difficult to read. Significant work is warranted to improve
   their readability in order to achieve CliniclTrials.gov's goal of
   facilitating information dissemination and subject recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonequilibrium fixed-shape three-craft
   Coulomb formation reconfiguration problem. Being aware that using the
   feedback-control approach might result in the chattering of the charges
   due to the nonequilibrium nature of the system dynamics, this paper
   proposes a trajectory planning approach to accomplish the
   reconfiguration. Entire maneuver trajectories are divided into multiple
   phases. During each phase, only two of the three craft are charged. In
   this way, the relative trajectory of the charged spacecraft during a
   certain phase is a conic section. Entire trajectories are composed of
   patched conics and/or straight lines. The procedures determining the
   three-phase maneuver strategy are developed, including a preadjusting
   phase and two transition phases. Numerical simulations demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the algorithm and the elegance of the charge histories.}},

Abstract = {{According to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   (SEER) program in the United States, approximately 15\% of men will be

   years, the battle against prostate cancer has been joined by researchers
   and practitioners who have used a wide variety of operations research
   (OR) models and methods to investigate decisions involving screening,
   detection, and treatment of prostate cancer. We provide a narrative
   review of articles falling into the following five categories: decision
   analysis, machine learning, optimization, simulation, and statistics. We
   identified a total of 523 archival journal articles describing the use
   of methods in these categories in the context of prostate cancer since
   2000. We categorize and annotate 49 of these articles in order to
   provide representative examples of the use of OR models and methods in
   each of these areas. We conclude with a summary of the trends in
   research using OR methods in the context of prostate cancer over the
   past 15 years, and a discussion about how these trends will influence

Title = {{Designing durable icephobic surfaces}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Ice accretion has a negative impact on critical infrastructure, as well
   as a range of commercial and residential activities. Icephobic surfaces
   are defined by an ice adhesion strength tau(ice) < 100 kPa. However, the
   passive removal of ice requires much lower values of tau(ice), such as
   on airplane wings or power lines (tau(ice) < 20 kPa). Such low tau(ice)
   values are scarcely reported, and robust coatings that maintain these
   low values have not been reported previously. We show that, irrespective
   of material chemistry, by tailoring the cross-link density of different
   elastomeric coatings and by enabling interfacial slippage, it is
   possible to systematically design coatings with extremely low ice
   adhesion (tau(ice) < 0.2 kPa). These newfound mechanisms allow for the
   rational design of icephobic coatings with virtually any desired ice
   adhesion strength. By using these mechanisms, we fabricate extremely
   durable coatings that maintain tau(ice) < 10 kPa after severe mechanical
   abrasion, acid/base exposure, 100 icing/deicing cycles, thermal cycling,
   accelerated corrosion, and exposure to Michigan wintery conditions over
   several months.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Could social media data aid in disaster response and damage assessment?
   Countries face both an increasing frequency and an increasing intensity
   of natural disasters resulting from climate change. During such events,
   citizens turn to social media platforms for disaster-related
   communication and information. Social media improves situational
   awareness, facilitates dissemination of emergency information, enables
   early warning systems, and helps coordinate relief efforts. In addition,
   the spatiotemporal distribution of disaster-related messages helps with
   the real-time monitoring and assessment of the disaster itself. We
   present a multiscale analysis of Twitter activity before, during, and
   after Hurricane Sandy. We examine the online response of 50 metropolitan
   areas of the United States and find a strong relationship between
   proximity to Sandy's path and hurricane-related social media activity.
   We show that real and perceived threats, together with physical disaster
   effects, are directly observable through the intensity and composition
   of Twitter's message stream. We demonstrate that per-capita Twitter
   activity strongly correlates with the per-capita economic damage
   inflicted by the hurricane. We verify our findings for a wide range of
   disasters and suggest that massive online social networks can be used
   for rapid assessment of damage caused by a large-scale disaster.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical failure in the electrode is one of major reasons for capacity
   fade. In this study we focus on inter-particle fracture, specifically
   the debonding at the interface between the graphite particle and binder.
   We integrate the electrochemical-mechanical model and the cohesive zone
   model to investigate the interfacial debonding during lithium
   intercalation. We found that the mechanism of fracture at the
   particle/binder interface is different from that inside a particle. The
   debonding at the interface is caused by the expansion of the particle
   that is closely related to the total amount of lithium intercalation,
   while the fracture inside a particle is caused by the gradient of
   lithium concentration. As a result, debonding at the interface is more
   likely to occur as the particle size and C-rate decrease, which is
   opposite to the trend of fracture inside a particle that is more likely
   to occur as the particle size and C-rate increase. This understanding of
   debonding mechanism can provide insight into capacity fade and guide the
   development of more robust electrodes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   library for playing the sound files. FRJ is crossplatform and can run on
   both Windows and Linux operating systems. The source code was written in
   C++. The accuracy of the recognition program can reach up to 90\% under
   controlled lighting and distance conditions. The user is able to train
   up to 6 different people (as many as will fit in the GUI). When

Abstract = {{In rare situations, stochastic programs can be solved analytically.
   Otherwise, approximation is necessary to solve stochastic programs with
   a large or infinite number of scenarios to a desired level of accuracy.
   This involves statistical sampling or deterministic selection of a
   finite set of scenarios to obtain a tractable deterministic equivalent
   problem. Some of these approaches rely on bounds for primal and dual
   decision variables of the second stage. We develop new algorithms to
   improve these bounds and reduce the deterministic approximation error.
   Experiments were conducted to compare a sequential approximation
   approach with and without these new algorithms. Each algorithm is
   applied to a set of test instances for a problem of managing

Abstract = {{We present a method for quantifying sacral kinematics during
   countermovement jumping (CMJ) using an inertial measurement unit (IMU).
   The IMU-derived sacral kinematic trajectories reproduced motion capture
   acceleration, velocity, and displacement to within mean (standard
   deviation) differences of 0.024 (0.088) m/s(2), 0.023 (0.026) m/s, and
   0.003 (0.032) m, respectively, across 252 jumps performed by 14
   subjects. The method also quantified differences in maximum sacral
   displacement to within 1 \% and differences in maximum propulsive
   velocity to within 0.7 \% of motion capture estimates. This builds upon
   existing IMU-based methods for quantifying jump performance, which do
   not provide sacral kinematic trajectories. The utility of this method is
   demonstrated by its ability to discriminate jump performance metrics
   across a diverse subject population. In particular, we found that 21
   participants adopted multiple strategies to maximize jump height in
   unloaded and loaded fresh conditions, but converged to a common strategy
   when jumping fatigued and under load. Changes in kinematic parameters
   were evident across conditions, and several changes were significantly
   associated with changes in jump performance (i.e., height). These
   parameters include changes in the depth of the countermovement, duration
   of the propulsive phase and maximum propulsive velocity. Collectively,
   these results point toward the future use of this method in naturalistic
   environments and for multiple objectives including biomechanical
   performance assessment and tracking, fatigue assessment, and jump
   training.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies planar pursuit-evasion games in the presence of
   obstacles that inhibit the motions of the players. The goal is to
   construct the dominance regions, where a point in the plane is said to
   be dominated by one of the players if that player is able to reach the
   point before the opposing players, regardless of the opposing players'
   actions. The key achievements of the paper are to provide the dominance
   regions and to show that an analysis of dominance provides a complete
   solution to the game. This paper also presents a study of the effects of
   obstacles by comparing the dominance regions in the presence and absence
   of obstacles. The obstacles considered include line segments and
   polygons as well as obstacles that have asymmetric effects on the
   players. As part of the discussion, a novel, multiplayer pursuit-evasion
   game is also presented. It features three players on two teams, and it
   can be used to model rescue scenarios and biological behaviors. The
   solution of this game cannot be determined from the previous literature,
   but the methods provided in this paper are used to determine dominance
   and solve the game. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present evidence of resonant wave-wave coupling via toroidal field
   line resonance (FLR) signatures in the Space Weather Modeling
   Framework's (SWMF) global, terrestrial magnetospheric model in one
   simulation driven by a synthetic upstream solar wind with embedded
   broadband dynamic pressure fluctuations. Using in situ, stationary point
   measurements of the radial electric field along the 1500 LT meridian, we
   show that SWMF reproduces a multiharmonic, continuous distribution of
   FLRs exemplified by 180 degrees phase reversals and amplitude peaks
   across the resonant L shells. By linearly increasing the amplitude of
   the dynamic pressure fluctuations in time, we observe a commensurate
   increase in the amplitude of the radial electric and azimuthal magnetic
   field fluctuations, which is consistent with the solar wind driver being
   the dominant source of the fast mode energy. While we find no
   discernible local time changes in the FLR frequencies despite
   large-scale, monotonic variations in the dayside equatorial mass
   density, in selectively sampling resonant points and examining spectral
   resonance widths, we observe significant radial, harmonic, and
   time-dependent local time asymmetries in the radial electric field
   amplitudes. A weak but persistent local time asymmetry exists in
   measures of the estimated coupling efficiency between the fast mode and
   toroidal wave fields, which exhibits a radial dependence consistent with
   the coupling strength examined by Mann et al. (1999) and Zhu and
   Kivelson (1988). We discuss internal structural mechanisms and
   additional external energy sources that may account for these
   asymmetries as we find that local time variations in the strength of the
   compressional driver are not the predominant source of the FLR amplitude
   asymmetries. These include resonant mode coupling of observed
   Kelvin-Helmholtz surface wave generated Pc5 band ultralow frequency
   pulsations, local time differences in local ionospheric dampening rates,
   and variations in azimuthal mode number, which may impact the
   partitioning of spectral energy between the toroidal and poloidal wave
   modes.}},

Abstract = {{The Naval Research Laboratory SAMI3 (Sami3 is Also a Model of the

   Model-Cold PLasma) codes are used to model observed plasmasphere
   dynamics during 25 November 2001 to 1 December 2001 and 1-5 February
   2001. Model results compare well to plasmasphere observations of
   electron and mass densities. Comparison of model results to refilling
   data and to each other shows good agreement, generally within a factor
   of 2. We find that SAMI3 plasmaspheric refilling rates and ion densities
   are sensitive to the composition and temperature of the thermosphere and
   exosphere, and to photoelectron heating. Results also support our
   previous finding that the wind-driven dynamo significantly impacts both
   refilling rates and plasmasphere dynamics during quiet periods.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for the implementation of set-based design communications
   and negotiations in the conceptual ship design phase is outlined. The
   newly developed methodology relies on a hybrid agent type-1 fuzzy logic
   system (FLS). The hybridization stems from the use of human designers
   who fulfill agent roles by interacting with a computational fuzzy logic
   system, graphical user interfaces, and a networked software tool. The
   authors outline the motivation for the development of the hybrid agent
   set based type-1 FLS, including the differences and benefits between
   point-based and set-based design methods. Details of the hybrid agent
   FLS components, as well as the communications and negotiations process,
   are also discussed. Conceptual container ship designs were performed in
   order to verify the functionality of the method and associated tools.
   The results show the ability of the hybrid agent type-1 FLS to
   facilitate the core set-based design values of set-based communication
   and gradual narrowing of the solution space. The FLS method was also
   compared to an unstructured chat window, Internet based, communications
   method commonly used by design groups working from multiple locations. A
   comparison of the two methods showed the structured FLS to be more
   capable of facilitating SBD qualities than the chat window method.}},

Abstract = {{Large-eddy simulations of a wing-body junction flow experimentally
   studied are presented. Wall junction flows are common in engineering
   applications, but the flow physics at the corners of the junction is not
   well understood. Moreover, in these types of flows, the performance of
   the subgrid-scale models frequently used for large-eddy simulations is
   not well characterized. To address these issues, large-eddy simulations
   of the wing-body junction are performed, with multiple levels of grid
   resolution. Two-dimensional turbulent profiles are generated every time
   step and introduced to the inlet plane of the computation domain to
   mimic the unsteady turbulent boundary layer. A Reynolds-averaged
   Navier-Stokes calculation is used as a precursor to initialize the
   flowfield of the large-eddy simulations. Then, large-eddy simulations
   with the Vreman model is performed and the simulation results are
   analyzed with respect to three specific goals: compare the computed and
   measured turbulence statistics in the junction region, investigate the
   flow physics in the corner region, and discuss the potential reasons for
   the inaccuracies of the subgrid-scale model. The sensitivity of the
   predicted results to inflow conditions and to subgrid-scale modeling is
   also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a nonparametric data-driven algorithm called DDM for the
   management of stochastic periodic-review multiproduct inventory systems
   with a warehouse-capacity constraint. The demand distribution is not
   known a priori and the firm only has access to past sales data (often
   referred to as censored demand data). We measure performance of DDM
   through regret, the difference between the total expected cost of DDM
   and that of an oracle with access to the true demand distribution acting
   optimally. We characterize the rate of convergence guarantee of DDM.
   More specifically, we show that the average expected T-period cost
   incurred under DDM converges to the optimal cost at the rate of
   O(T-1/2). Our asymptotic analysis significantly generalizes approaches
   used in Huh and Rusmevichientong (2009) for the uncapacitated
   single-product inventory systems. We also discuss several extensions and
   conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{To increase resilience in supply chains, we investigate the optimal
   design of flexibility in a backup system. We model the dynamics of
   disruptions as Markov chains, and consider a multiproduct, multisupplier
   supply chain under dynamic disruption risks. Using our model, we first
   show that a little flexibility in the backup system can go a long way in
   mitigating dynamic disruption risks. This raises an important and
   fundamental question in designing flexibility in the backup system: to
   achieve the benefits of full backup flexibility, which unreliable
   suppliers should be backed up? To answer this question, we connect the
   supply chain to various queueing and dam models by analyzing the
   dynamics of the inventory shortfall process. Using this connection, we
   show that backing up suppliers merely based on first moment
   considerations such as their average reliability or average product
   demand can be misleading. All else equal, it is better to back up
   suppliers with (1) longer but less frequent disruptions, and (2) lower
   demand uncertainty. In addition to such second moment effects, by
   employing the Renyi's Theorem, we demonstrate that when disruptions are
   relatively long (if they occur), backing up the suppliers for which the
   expected wasted backup capacity is minimum provides the best backup
   flexibility design. We also develop easy-to-compute and yet effective
   indices that (a) guide the supply chain designer in deciding which
   suppliers to backup, and (b) provide insights into the role of various
   factors such as inventory holding and shortage costs, purchasing costs,
   suppliers reliabilities, and product demand distributions in designing
   backup flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{We develop the first approximation algorithm for periodic-review
   perishable inventory systems with setup costs. The ordering lead time is
   zero. The model allows for correlated demand processes that generalize
   the well-known approaches to model dynamic demand forecast updates. The
   structure of optimal policies for this fundamental class of problems is
   not known in the literature. Thus, finding provably near-optimal control
   policies has been an open challenge. We develop a randomized
   proportional-balancing policy (RPB) that can be efficiently implemented
   in an online manner, and we show that it admits a worst-case performance
   guarantee between 3 and 4. The main challenge in our analysis is to
   compare the setup costs between RPB and the optimal policy in the
   presence of inventory perishability, which departs significantly from
   the previous works in the literature. The numerical results show that
   the average performance of RPB is good (within 1\% of optimality under
   i.i.d. demands and within 7\% under correlated demands).}},

Abstract = {{The aeroelastic response of a bird-damaged fan stage at the inlet of a
   high-bypass ratio turbofan engine is examined using a combined
   computational fluid dynamics and computational structural dynamics
   framework. The damaged fan sector consists of five blades obtained from
   accurate numerical simulation of the bird impact. Forced and aeroelastic
   response calculations are performed and compared to assess the role of
   aeroelastic coupling. The calculations are performed at 100, 75, and
   60\% throttle settings to investigate the role of engine speed on the
   fan response. Results from the forced response and aeroelastic response
   calculations indicate that the undamaged blades opposite the damaged
   sector exhibit the highest level of structural response. Comparing the
   forced response with the aeroelastic response shows increased
   participation of the higher structural modes, especially for the damaged
   blades, that grow in time or exhibit beating. Examination of the work
   performed by the aerodynamic forces suggests that the growth in blade
   response is due to aeroelastic phenomena and can cause a potential
   instability. The results illustrate the importance of aeroelastic
   effects when predicting the post-bird-strike fan response.}},

Abstract = {{Bolted joints are susceptible to loosening in the vibrational service
   environment, which would adversely affect the joint structure integrity.
   In this work, a nonlinear-modulation approach was explored as a
   potential method to effectively detect bolt loosening at its early
   stage, by analyzing the modulation spectrum that arises from the
   nonlinear vibrations caused by the loosening bolts. To reveal the
   mechanism of nonlinear modulation, a mathematical model was developed.
   An effective energy-based damage index was formulated based on the
   high-frequency intrinsic mode functions (IMF), which contains modulation
   components processed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Vibration
   tests on a frame structure were carried out to investigate the
   feasibility of the proposed method. The experimental results
   demonstrated that modulation occurred in the high-frequency region of
   response signals; it was found that the energy-based damage index can
   accurately detect nonlinear damage caused by bolt loosening with superb
   sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we demonstrated that ultrasound-based hyperthermia can
   activate cells containing a heat-activated and ligand-inducible gene
   switch in a spatio-temporally controlled manner. These engineered cells
   can be incorporated into hydrogel scaffolds (e.g., fibrin) for in vivo
   implantation, where ultrasound can be used to non-invasively pattern
   transgene expression. Due to their high water content, the acoustic
   attenuation of fibrin scaffolds is low. Thus, long ultrasound exposures
   and high acoustic intensities are needed to generate sufficient
   hyperthermia for gene activation. Here, we demonstrate that the
   attenuation of fibrin scaffolds and the resulting hyperthermia
   achievable with ultrasound can be increased significantly by doping the
   fibrin with hydroxyapatite (HA) nanopowder. The attenuation of a 1\%
   (w/v) fibrin scaffold with 5\% (w/v) HA was similar to soft tissue.
   Transgene activation of cells harboring the gene switch occurred at
   lower acoustic intensities and shorter exposures when the cells were
   encapsulated in HA-doped fibrin scaffolds versus undoped scaffolds.
   Inclusion of HA in the fibrin scaffold did not affect the viability of
   the encapsulated cells. (E-mail: mfabiill@umich.edu) (C) 2016 World

Abstract = {{High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are endogenous nanoparticles involved in
   the transport and metabolism of cholesterol, phospholipids, and
   triglycerides. HDL is well-known as the ``good{''} cholesterol because
   it not only removes excess cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaques but
   also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, which protect
   the cardiovascular system. Circulating HDL also transports endogenous
   proteins, vitamins, hormones, and microRNA to various organs. Compared
   with other synthetic nanocarriers, such as liposomes, micelles, and
   inorganic and polymeric nanoparticles, HDL has unique features that
   allow them to deliver cargo to specific targets more efficiently. These
   attributes include their ultrasmall size (8-12 nm in diameter), high
   tolerability in humans (up to 8 g of protein per infusion), long
   circulating half-life (12-24 h), and intrinsic targeting properties to
   different recipient cells. Various recombinant ApoA proteins and ApoA
   mimetic peptides have been recently developed for the preparation of
   reconstituted HDL that exhibits properties similar to those of
   endogenous HDL and has a potential for industrial scale-up. In this
   review, we will summarize (a) clinical pharmacokinetics and safety of
   reconstituted HDL products, (b) comparison of HDL with inorganic and
   other organic nanoparticles, (c) the rationale for using HDL as drug
   delivery vehicles for important therapeutic indications, (d) the current
   state-of-the-art in HDL production, and (e) HDL-based drug delivery
   strategies for small molecules, peptides/proteins, nucleic acids, and

Abstract = {{Chiroptical materials found in butterflies, beetles, stomatopod
   crustaceans, and other creatures are attributed to biocomposites with
   helical motifs and multiscale hierarchical organization. These
   structurally sophisticated materials self-assemble from primitive
   nanoscale building blocks, a process that is simpler and more energy
   efficient than many top-down methods currently used to produce similarly
   sized three-dimensional materials. Here, we report that molecular-scale
   chirality of a CdTe nanoparticle surface can be translated to nanoscale
   helical assemblies, leading to chiroptical activity in the visible
   electromagnetic range. Chiral CdTe nanoparticles coated with cysteine
   self organize around Te cores to produce helical supraparticles.
   D-/L-Form of the amino acid determines the dominant left/right helicity
   of the supraparticles. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations

Abstract = {{Memristors, based on inherent memory effects in simple two-terminal
   structures, have attracted tremendous interest recently for applications
   ranging from nonvolatile data storage to neuromorphic computing based on
   non-von Neumann architectures. In a memristor, the ability to modulate
   and retain the state of an internal variable leads to experimentally
   observed resistive switching (RS) effects. Such phenomena originate from
   internal, microscopic ionic migration and associated electrochemical
   processes that modify the materials' electrical and other physical
   properties. To optimize the device performance for practical
   applications with large-size arrays, controlling the internal ionic
   transport and redox reaction processes thus becomes a necessity, ideally
   at the atomic scale. Here we show that the RS characteristics in
   tantalum-oxide-based memristors can be systematically tuned by inserting
   a graphene film with engineered nanopores. Graphene, with its atomic
   thickness and excellent impermeability and chemical stability, can be
   effectively integrated into the device stack and can offer unprecedented
   capabilities for the control of ionic dynamics at the nanoscale. In this
   device structure, the graphene film effectively blocks ionic transport
   and redox reactions; thereby the oxygen vacancies required during the RS
   process are allowed to transport only through the engineered nanosized
   openings in the graphene layer, leading to effective modulation of the
   device performance by controlling the nanopore size in graphene. The
   roles of graphene as an ion-blocking layer in the device structure were
   further supported by transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy, and atomistic simulations based on first-principles
   calculations.}},

Title = {{A TonB-Dependent Transporter Is Responsible for Methanobactin Uptake by

Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{Methanobactin, a small modified polypeptide synthesized by methanotrophs
   for copper uptake, has been found to be chromosomally encoded. The gene
   encoding the polypeptide precursor of methanobactin, mbnA, is part of a
   gene cluster that also includes several genes encoding proteins of
   unknown function (but speculated to be involved in methanobactin
   formation) as well as mbnT, which encodes a TonB-dependent transporter
   hypothesized to be responsible for methanobactin uptake. To determine if
   mbnT is truly responsible for methanobactin uptake, a knockout was
   constructed in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b using marker exchange
   mutagenesis. The resulting M. trichosporium mbnT:: Gm(r) mutant was
   found to be able to produce methanobactin but was unable to internalize
   it. Further, if this mutant was grown in the presence of copper and
   exogenous methanobactin, copper uptake was significantly reduced.
   Expression of mmoX and pmoA, encoding polypeptides of the soluble
   methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and particulate methane monooxygenase
   (pMMO), respectively, also changed significantly when methanobactin was
   added, which indicates that the mutant was unable to collect copper
   under these conditions. Copper uptake and gene expression, however, were
   not affected in wild-type M. trichosporium OB3b, indicating that the
   TonB-dependent transporter encoded by mbnT is responsible for
   methanobactin uptake and that methanobactin is a key mechanism used by
   methanotrophs for copper uptake. When the mbnT:: Gmr mutant was grown
   under a range of copper concentrations in the absence of methanobactin,
   however, the phenotype of the mutant was indistinguishable from that of
   wild-type M. trichosporium OB3b, indicating that this methanotroph has
   multiple mechanisms for copper uptake.}},

Title = {{Pharmacokinetic profile that reduces nephrotoxicity of gentamicin in a
   perfused kidney-on-a-chip}},
Journal = {{BIOFABRICATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Nephrotoxicity is often underestimated because renal clearance in
   animals is higher compared to in humans. This paper aims to illustrate
   the potential to fill in such pharmacokinetic gaps between animals and
   humans using a microfluidic kidney model. As an initial demonstration,
   we compare nephrotoxicity of a drug, administered at the same total
   dosage, but using different pharmacokinetic regimens. Kidney epithelial
   cell, cultured under physiological shear stress conditions, are exposed
   to gentamicin using regimens that mimic the pharmacokinetics of bolus
   injection or continuous infusion in humans. The perfusion culture
   utilized is important both for controlling drug exposure and for
   providing cells with physiological shear stress (1.0 dyn cm(-2)).
   Compared to static cultures, perfusion culture improves epithelial
   barrier function. We tested two drug treatment regimens that give the
   same gentamycin dose over a 24 h period. In one regimen, we mimicked
   drug clearance profiles for human bolus injection by starting cell
   exposure at 19.2 mM of gentamicin and reducing the dosage level by half
   every 2 h over a 24 h period. In the other regimen, we continuously
   infused gentamicin (3 mM for 24 h). Although junctional protein
   immunoreactivity was decreased with both regimens, ZO-1 and occludin
   fluorescence decreased less with the bolus injection mimicking regimen.
   The bolus injection mimicking regimen also led to less cytotoxicity and
   allowed the epithelium to maintain low permeability, while continuous
   infusion led to an increase in cytotoxicity and permeability. These data
   show that gentamicin disrupts cell-cell junctions, increases membrane
   permeability, and decreases cell viability particularly with prolonged
   low-level exposure. Importantly a bolus injection mimicking regimen
   alleviates much of the nephrotoxicity compared to the continuous infused
   regimen. In addition to potential relevance to clinical gentamicin
   administration regimens, the results are important in demonstrating the
   general potential of using microfluidic cell culture models for
   pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies.}},

Abstract = {{Brain activity can predict a person's level of engagement in an
   attentional task. However, estimates of brain activity are often
   confounded by measurement artifacts and systemic physiological noise.
   The optimal method for filtering this noise - thereby increasing such
   state prediction accuracy - remains unclear. To investigate this, we
   asked study participants to perform an attentional task while we
   monitored their brain activity with functional near infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS). We observed higher state prediction accuracy when
   noise in the fNIRS hemoglobin {[}Hb] signals was filtered with a
   non-stationary (adaptive) model as compared to static regression (84\%
   +/- 6\% versus 72\% +/- 15\%). (C)2016 Optical Society of America}},

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{571-584}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Our prior work has studied the enforcement of opacity security
   properties using insertion functions. Given a system that is not opaque,
   the so-called All Insertion Structure (AIS) is a game structure, played
   by the system and the insertion function, that embeds all valid
   insertion functions. In this paper, we first propose a more compact AIS
   that can be constructed with lower computational complexity. We then
   introduce the maximum total cost and the maximum mean cost, and use them
   as quantitative objectives to solve for optimal insertion functions.
   Specifically, we first determine if an insertion function with a finite
   total cost exists. If such an insertion function exists, we synthesize
   an optimal total-cost insertion function. Otherwise, we construct an
   optimal mean-cost insertion function. In either case, we find an optimal
   insertion strategy on the AIS, with respect to the corresponding cost
   objective. The algorithmic procedures are adapted from results developed
   for minimax games and mean payoff games. The resulting optimal strategy
   is represented as a subgraph of the AIS that consists of all the system
   actions and the optimal insertion actions. Finally, we use this subgraph
   to synthesize an optimal insertion function that is encoded as an I/O
   automaton.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of multi-agent coordination and control
   under multiple objectives, and presents a set-theoretic formulation
   amenable to Lyapunov-based analysis and control design. A novel class of
   Lyapunov-like barrier functions is introduced and used to encode
   multiple, non-trivial control objectives, such as collision avoidance,
   proximity maintenance and convergence to desired destinations. The
   construction is based on recentered barrier functions and on maximum
   approximation functions. Thus, a single Lyapunov-like function is used
   to encode the constrained set of each agent, yielding simple,
   gradient-based control solutions. The derived control strategies are
   distributed, i.e., based on information locally available to each agent,
   which is dictated by sensing and communication limitations. Furthermore,
   the proposed coordination protocol dictates semi-cooperative conflict
   resolution among agents, which can be also thought as prioritization, as
   well as conflict resolution with respect to an agent (the leader) which
   is not actively participating in collision avoidance, except when
   necessary. The considered scenario is pertinent to surveillance tasks
   and involves nonholonomic vehicles. The efficacy of the approach is
   demonstrated through simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Sniffer channel assignment (SCA) is a fundamental building block for
   wireless data capture, which is essential for traffic monitoring and
   network forensics. Most of the existing SCA approaches for cognitive
   radio networks (CRNs) adopt optimization-based methods and rely on the
   prior knowledge of the secondary user (SU) activities. To relax this
   constraint, learning-based methods have been recently developed;
   however, there is still insufficient theoretical understanding within
   the learning framework for SCA. In this paper, we aim to maximize the
   total amount of the captured SU traffic, and we formulate the SCA
   problem as a nonstochastic/adversarial multiarmed bandit problem.
   Moreover, the inherent error in wireless capturing, i.e., imperfect
   monitoring, is considered in our model. We propose two online learning
   algorithms for the SCA scenarios with and without channel switching
   costs, respectively, and their regret performances are proved uniformly
   sublinear in time and polynomial in the number of channels. The
   numerical evaluation shows, in addition to their robust regret
   performances, the proposed algorithms greatly outperform the existing
   SCA approaches in the amount of effectively captured SU traffic.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple hurricanes have impacted coastal areas of the USA and they
   represent one of the most costly natural hazards in the country. In an
   effort to comprehend the regional vulnerability and resilience to these
   hazards, a multidisciplinary team is developing an novel framework, the
   Integrated Hazard, Impact, and Resilience Model (IHIRM). Storm surge
   modelling is a key role of this framework and inundation from multiple
   scenarios will be estimated by using a hydrodynamic model (ADCIRC) and a
   wave model (SWAN). Simulating a large number of storm surge scenarios
   requires a considerable computational effort and therefore the
   trade-offs between cost and accuracy must be investigated. Initially,
   model response sensitivity to numerical mesh resolution was performed
   for Hurricanes Irene (2011) and Sandy (2012). Results from the moderate
   and high resolution meshes provided similar values, while the increase
   of computational time was substantial. Secondly, we explored the
   difference between the maximum water levels simulated with ADCIRC and
   with the coupled version ADCIRC+SWAN (i.e., contribution of wave setup
   during the peak of the storm). The contribution of wave setup to the
   overall water levels was less than 0.1 m inside the Chesapeake Bay and
   0.5 m outside the Bay. Additionally, the computational time
   significantly increased for the coupled version simulation. Hence,
   neglecting the contribution of wave setup in areas like the upper
   Chesapeake Bay would not have a significant impact on the surge
   estimates and a considerable amount of resources would be saved.
   Conversely, wave setup must be considered at open coast areas.}},

Abstract = {{The balance between bone resorption and bone formation is vital for
   maintenance and regeneration of alveolar bone and supporting structures
   around teeth and dental implants. Tissue regeneration in the oral cavity
   is regulated by multiple cell types, signaling mechanisms, and matrix
   interactions. A goal for periodontal tissue engineering/regenerative
   medicine is to restore oral soft and hard tissues through cell,
   scaffold, and/or signaling approaches to functional and aesthetic oral
   tissues. Bony defects in the oral cavity can vary significantly, ranging
   from smaller intrabony lesions resulting from periodontal or
   peri-implant diseases to large osseous defects that extend through the
   jaws as a result of trauma, tumor resection, or congenital defects. The
   disparity in size and location of these alveolar defects is compounded
   further by patient-specific and environmental factors that contribute to
   the challenges in periodontal regeneration, peri-implant tissue
   regeneration, and alveolar ridge reconstruction. Efforts have been made
   over the last few decades to produce reliable and predictable methods to
   stimulate bone regeneration in alveolar bone defects. Tissue
   engineering/regenerative medicine provide new avenues to enhance tissue
   regeneration by introducing bioactive models or constructing
   patient-specific substitutes. This review presents an overview of
   therapies (e. g., protein, gene, and cell based) and biomaterials (e.
   g., resorbable, nonresorbable, and 3-dimensionally printed) used for
   alveolar bone engineering around teeth and implants and for implant site
   development, with emphasis on most recent findings and future
   directions.}},

Abstract = {{The need to model geometrically complex systems with improved ease of
   use and fidelity and the desire to extend the Tools for Sensitivity and
   UNcertainty Analysis Methodology Implementation (TSUNAMI) analysis to
   advanced applications have motivated the development of a methodology
   for calculating sensitivity coefficients in continuous-energy (CE) Monte
   Carlo applications. The Contributon-Linked eigenvalue
   sensitivity/Uncertainty estimation via Track length importance
   CHaracterization (CLUTCH) and Iterated Fission Probability (IFP)
   eigenvalue sensitivity methods were recently implemented in the CE KENO
   framework of the SCALE code system to enable TSUNAMI-3D to perform
   eigenvalue sensitivity calculations using CE Monte Carlo methods. This
   paper provides a detailed description of the theory behind the CLUTCH
   method and describes in detail its implementation. This work also
   explores the improvements in eigenvalue sensitivity coefficient accuracy
   that can be gained through use of CE sensitivity methods and compares
   several sensitivity methods in terms of computational efficiency and
   memory requirements. The IFP and CLUTCH methods produced sensitivity
   coefficient estimates that matched, and in some cases exceeded, the
   accuracy of those produced using the multigroup TSUNAMI-3D approach. The
   CLUTCH method was found to calculate sensitivity coefficients with the
   highest degree of efficiency and the lowest computational memory
   footprint for the problems examined.}},

Abstract = {{Tomographic methods such as electrical impedance tomography have
   tremendous potential for electrical conductivity-based structural health
   monitoring, damage identification, strain sensing, and
   environmental/corrosion sensing as evidenced by a growing body of
   literature employing electrical impedance tomography. However,
   electrical impedance tomography also has important limitations
   preventing its widespread acceptance such as requiring burdensome
   computational resources not available to on-board structural health
   monitoring and often difficult to obtain initial estimates of
   conductivity distributions. We herein overcome these limitations by
   developing a novel electrical impedance tomography reconstruction
   algorithm with substantially abated computational requirements and
   independent of initial estimates. This method is predicated on the
   difference between two sets of observed voltages being due to a
   difference in resistivity that is constrained to be a summation of
   two-dimensional sine waves. This method is first explored analytically
   and then demonstrated experimentally on three different materials. This
   approach is an important advancement to the state of the art because it
   overcomes critical limitations of electrical impedance tomography
   thereby substantially facilitating the viability of electrical impedance
   tomography for real structural health monitoring applications.}},

Title = {{Boundedly rational route choice behavior: A review of models and
   methodologies}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{Perfect rationality (PR) has been widely used in modeling travel
   behavior. As opposed to PR, bounded rationality (BR) has recently
   regained researchers' attention since it Was first introduced into
   transportation science in the 1980s due to its power in more realistic
   travel behavior modeling and prediction. This paper provides a
   comprehensive survey on the models of BR route choice behavior, aiming
   to identify current research gaps and provide directions for future
   research. Despite a small but growing body of studies on employing
   bounded rationality principle, BR route chbice behavior remains
   understudied due to the following reasons: (a) The existence of BR
   thresholds leads to mathematically intractable properties of equilibria;
   (b) BR parameters are usually latent and difficult to identify and
   estimate; and (c) BR is associated with human being's cognitive process
   and is challenging to model. Accordingly, we will review how existing
   literature addresses the aforementioned challenges in substantive and
   procedural bounded rationality models. Substantive bounded rationality
   models focus on choice outcomes while procedural bounded rationality
   models focus on the empirical studies of choice processes. Bounded
   rationality models in each category can be further divided based on
   whether time dimension is included. Accordingly, static and dynamic
   traffic assignment are introduced in substantive bounded rationality
   while two-stage cognitive models and day-to-day learning models in
   procedural bounded rationality are discussed. The methodologies employed
   in substantive bounded rationality include game theory and interactive
   congestion game, while those in procedural bounded rationality mainly
   adopt random utility and non- or semi-compensatory models. A comparison
   of all existing methodologies are given and bounded rationality models'
   scope and boundaries in terms of predictability, transferability,
   tractability, and scalability are discussed. Finally existing research
   gaps are presented and several promising future research directions are
   given. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer-ligand conjugates are designed to bind proteins for applications
   as drugs, imaging agents, and transport scaffolds. In this work, we
   demonstrate a folic acid (FA)-triggered exosite binding of a generation
   five poly(amidoamine) (G5 PAMAM) dendrimer scaffold to bovine folate
   binding protein (bFBP). The protein exosite is a secondary binding site
   on the protein surface, separate from the FA binding pocket, to which
   the dendrimer binds. Exosite binding is required to achieve the greatly
   enhanced binding constants and protein structural change observed in
   this study. The G(5)AcCOG-FAL(1.0) conjugate bound tightly to bFBP, was
   not displaced by a 28-fold excess of FA, and quenched roughly 80\% of
   the initial fluorescence. Two-step binding kinetics were measured using
   the intrinsic fluorescence of the FBP tryptophan residues to give a K-D
   in the low nanomolar range for formation of the initial
   G5(Ac)-COG-FA(1.0)/FBP{*} complex, and a slow conversion to the tight
   complex formed between the dendrimer and the FBP exosite. The extent of
   quenching was sensitive to the choice of FA-dendrimer linker chemistry.
   Direct amide conjugation of FA to G5-PAMAM resulted in roughly 50\%
   fluorescence quenching of the FBP. The G5(Ac)-COG-FA, which has a longer
   linker containing a 1,2,3-triazole ring, exhibited an similar to 80\%
   fluorescence quenching. The binding of the G5(Ac)w-COG-FAL(1.0)
   conjugate was compared to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) conjugates of FA
   (PEG(n)-FA). PEG(2k)-FA had a binding strength similar to that of FA,
   whereas other PEG conjugates with higher molecular weight showed weaker
   binding. However, no PEG conjugates gave an increased degree of total
   fluorescence quenching.}},

Abstract = {{This study discusses experimental and modeling results of asphaltene
   aggregation and deposition using various n-alkanes as precipitants to
   destabilize asphaltenes from a crude oil. The amount of asphaltenes
   precipitated as a function of precipitant carbon number and
   concentration was obtained after monitoring the slow kinetic aggregation
   process. A geometric population balance was used to estimate the
   asphaltene asphaltene collision efficiency during bulk aggregation. The
   results revealed that, for a fixed volume fraction of precipitant, the
   collision efficiency decreases with increasing precipitant carbon
   number, resulting in slower aggregation. The tendency for asphaltenes to
   deposit was measured using capillary flow experiments under similar
   conditions. Similar asphaltene deposition behavior was obtained when the
   results were normalized by the asphaltene solubility and other
   experimental factors. A modified aggregation model was applied to the
   results and revealed that the difference between the asphaltene and
   solution solubility parameters is a dominant predictor of asphaltene
   aggregation. The time required to form an initial deposit inside the
   capillary apparatus was also found to correlate with the difference
   between asphaltene and solution solubility parameters. However, the
   deposition rate of asphaltenes in the capillary apparatus did not
   correlate with the collision efficiency or solubility parameter
   difference, contrary to initial expectations. The results suggest that
   mass transport barriers in the apparatus provided sufficient resistance
   to deposition as to limit observable correlation between the deposition
   rate and collision efficiency.}},

   than a conventional current-starved ring oscillator (CSRO) below 300 kHz

Abstract = {{We present a Bessel-beam launcher based on a leaky radial waveguide
   consisting of a capacitive sheet over a ground plane that supports
   higher-order leaky modes. A propagating Bessel beam is generated above
   the radiating waveguide. The Bessel beam is transverse-magnetic (TM)
   polarized with a vertical component of electric field that is a
   zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind. A higher-order
   leaky-wave mode is used to reduce losses at millimeter waves and, at the
   same time, avoid the thin dielectric layers used in previously proposed
   lower order leaky-wave Bessel launchers. Closed-form design equations
   are provided for the proposed structure. In addition, the operating
   bandwidth of the launcher is defined using dispersion analysis.
   Near-field measurements of a prototype operating in the frequency range
   38-39.5 GHz validate the concept. The measured launcher generates a
   Bessel beam with a stable spot size of about 4.3 mm (0.57 lambda) over a
   nondiffractive range of about 16.4 mm (2.2 lambda), within about a 4\%

Abstract = {{Histotripsy therapy produces cavitating bubble clouds to increasingly
   fractionate and eventually liquefy tissue using high-intensity
   ultrasound pulses. Following cavitation generated by each pulse,
   coherent motion of the cavitation residual nuclei can be detected using
   metrics formed from ultrasound color Doppler acquisitions. In this
   paper, three experiments were performed to investigate the
   characteristics of this motion as real-time feedback on histotripsy
   tissue fractionation. In the first experiment, bubble-induced color
   Doppler (BCD) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis monitored
   the residual cavitation nuclei in the treatment region in an agarose
   tissue phantom treated with two-cycle histotripsy pulses at >30 MPa
   using a 500-kHz transducer. Both BCD and PIV results showed brief
   chaotic motion of the residual nuclei followed by coherent motion first
   moving away from the transducer and then rebounding back. Velocity
   measurements from both PIV and BCD agreed well, showing a monotonic
   increase in rebound time up to a saturation point for increased therapy
   dose. In a second experiment, a thin layer of red blood cells (RBC) was
   added to the phantom to allow quantification of the fractionation of the
   RBC layer to compare with BCD metrics. A strong linear correlation was
   observed between the fractionation level and the time to BCD peak
   rebound velocity over histotripsy treatment. Finally, the correlation
   between BCD feedback and histotripsy tissue fractionation was validated
   in ex vivo porcine liver evaluated histologically. BCD metrics showed
   strong linear correlation with fractionation progression, suggesting
   that BCD provides useful quantitative real-time feedback on histotripsy
   treatment progression.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a ladder-type bulk acoustic wave (BAW) intrinsically
   switchable filter based on ferroelectric thin-film bulk acoustic
   resonators (FBARs). The switchable filter can be turned ON and OFF by
   the application of an external bias voltage due to the electrostrictive
   effect in thin-film ferroelectrics. In this paper, Barium Strontium
   Titanate (BST) is used as the ferroelectric material. A systematic
   design approach for switchable ladder-type ferroelectric filters is
   provided based on required filter specifications. A switchable filter is
   implemented in the form of a BST-on-Si composite structure to control
   the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient of FBARs. As an
   experimental verification, a 2.5-stage intrinsically switchable
   BST-on-Si composite FBAR filter is designed, fabricated, and measured.
   Measurement results for a typical BST-on-Si composite FBAR show a
   resonator mechanical quality factor (Q(m)) of 971, as well as a Q(m) x f
   of 2423 GHz. The filter presented here provides a measured insertion
   loss of 7.8 dB, out-of-band rejection of 26 dB, and fractional bandwidth
   of 0.33\% at 2.5827 GHz when the filter is in the ON state at a dc bias
   of 40 V. In its OFF state, the filter exhibits an isolation of 31 dB.}},

Title = {{Stress-gradient-induced polymer migration: Perturbation theory and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RHEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{While phenomenological expressions have been given in the past for
   polymer flux due to gradients in polymer stress or gradients in velocity
   gradient, we here provide a systematic perturbation theory for the
   coupled equations for polymer rheology, fluid dynamics, and polymer mass
   transport. Analytical results are obtained for the steady-state
   concentration of dilute dumbbells in the absence of hydrodynamic
   interactions, as a function of the Weissenberg number Wi, Peclet number
   Pe, and the ``gradient number{''} Gd, where the latter is the ratio of
   polymer equilibrium size to the characteristic distance over which
   velocity gradients change. At lowest order in all three perturbation
   variables, the theory yields a Poisson's equation with the driving term
   given by 2 (c) over barD tau(2) vjk,(j) v(j,j,k), where (c) over bar is
   the average concentration, D is the dumbbell diffusivity, tau is the
   relaxation time, and v is velocity with Einstein notation for the
   subscripts. We find using Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations in a simple
   Taylor vortex flow that this formula becomes accurate for small values
   of Gd, Wi, and Pe. For small Gd and Wi, but large Pe, we obtain accurate
   solutions from the Poisson's equation augmented with a simple convection
   term. For gradients beyond second order in Gd, continuum equations lose
   utility, but mesoscopic methods such as BD can then be used to determine
   polymer migration. We give a hierarchy of approximations that shows
   which equations and methods are required as the Peclet number Pe, the
   Weissenberg number Wi, and/or the gradient number Gd, exceed unity or as
   the polymer becomes concentrated or hydrodynamic interactions become
   important. (C) 2016 The Society of Rheology.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We test the notion that many microstructures have an underlying
   stationary probability distribution. The stationary probability
   distribution is ubiquitous: we know that different windows taken from a
   polycrystalline microstructure are generally `statistically similar'. To
   enable computation of such a probability distribution, microstructures
   are represented in the form of undirected probabilistic graphs called
   Markov Random Fields (MRFs). In the model, pixels take up integer or
   vector states and interact with multiple neighbors over a window. Using
   this lattice structure, algorithms are developed to sample the
   conditional probability density for the state of each pixel given the
   known states of its neighboring pixels. The sampling is performed using
   reference experimental images. 2D microstructures are artificially
   synthesized using the sampled probabilities. Statistical features such
   as grain size distribution and autocorrelation functions closely match
   with those of the experimental images. The mechanical properties of the
   synthesized microstructures were computed using the finite element
   method and were also found to match the experimental values.}},

Title = {{Parametric analysis of a cylindrical negative Poisson's ratio structure}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Much research related to negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), or auxetic,
   structures is emerging these days. Several types of 3D NPR structure
   have been proposed and studied, but almost all of them had cuboid
   shapes, which were not suitable for certain engineering applications. In
   this paper, a cylindrical NPR structure was developed and researched. It
   was expected to be utilized in springs, bumpers, dampers and other
   similar applications. For the purpose of parametric analysis, a method
   of parametric modeling of cylindrical NPR structures was developed using
   MATLAB scripts. The scripts can automatically establish finite element
   models, invoke ABAQUS, read results etc. Subsequently the influences of
   structural parameters, including number of cells, number of layers and
   layer heights, on the uniaxial compression behavior of cylinder NPR
   structures were researched. This led to the conclusion that the
   stiffness of the cylindrical NPR structure was enhanced on increasing
   the number of cells and reducing the effective layer height. Moreover,
   small numbers of layers resulted in a late transition area of the
   load-displacement curve from low stiffness to high stiffness. Moreover,
   the middle contraction regions were more apparent with larger numbers of
   cells, smaller numbers of layers and smaller effective layer heights.
   The results indicate that the structural parameters had significant
   effects on the load-displacement curves and deformed shapes of
   cylindrical NPR structures. This paper is conducive to the further
   engineering applications of cylindrical NPR structures.}},

Abstract = {{Although a specific group of transcription factors such as OCT4, SOX2,
   and NANOG are known to play essential roles in pluripotent stem cell
   (PSC) self-renewal, pluripotency, and reprogramming, other factors and
   the key signaling pathways regulating these important properties are not
   completely understood. Here, we demonstrate that the PSC marker
   Developmental Pluripotency Associated 5 (DPPA5) plays an important role
   in human PSC (hPSC) self-renewal and cell reprogramming in feeder-free
   conditions. Compared to hPSCs grown on mouse embryonic fibroblasts,
   cells cultured on feeder-free substrates, such as Matrigel, Laminin-511,
   Vitronectin, or the synthetic polymer poly{[}2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl
   dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide], had significantly higher
   DPPA5 gene expression and protein levels. Overexpression of DPPA5 in
   hPSCs increased NANOG protein levels via a post-transcriptional
   mechanism. Coimmunoprecipitation, protein stability assays, and
   quantitative RT-PCR, demonstrated that DPPA5 directly interacted,
   stabilized, and enhanced the function of NANOG in hPSCs. Additionally,
   DPPA5 increased the reprogramming efficiency of human somatic cells to
   induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Our study provides new insight
   into the function of DPPA5 and NANOG regulation in hPSCs.}},

Abstract = {{Lower mass and higher performances of structure with Negative Poisson's
   Ratio (NPR) make it a promising option in vehicle design. In this work,
   a new NPR structure is introduced and analyzed. The new NPR structure
   has high shear strength and its effective Young's modulus increases as
   the load increases. Mathematical models are firstly established to study
   the unique properties of the NPR structure. The parameterized model of
   the structure is then built to study the performance of the structure
   under large deformations condition. Due to the complexities of the
   nonlinear properties, the hybrid and adaptive meta-model (HAM)
   optimization method is employed for optimizing the NPR structure. The
   optimization results are compared with those of traditional optimization
   method to validate the effectiveness of this approach. Quasi-static
   compressive experiments are also conducted to verify the accuracy of the
   model and the effectiveness of the optimization. The results show that
   the NPR structure is optimized successfully and the HAM optimization
   method is of great effectiveness in finding the optimal NPR structure.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineered skeletal muscle has potential for application as a
   graft source for repairing soft tissue injuries, a model for testing
   pharmaceuticals, and a biomechanical actuator system for soft robots.
   However, engineered muscle to date has not produced forces comparable to
   native muscle, limiting its potential for repair and for use as an in
   vitro model for pharmaceutical testing. In this study, we examined the
   trophic effects of dexamethasone (DEX), a glucocorticoid that stimulates
   myoblast differentiation and fusion into myotubes, on our tissue
   engineered three-dimensional skeletal muscle units (SMUs). Using our
   established SMU fabrication protocol, muscle isolates were cultured with
   three experimental DEX concentrations (5, 10, and 25 nM) and compared to
   untreated controls. Following seeding onto a laminin-coated Sylgard
   substrate, the administration of DEX was initiated on day 0 or day 6 in
   growth medium or on day 9 after the switch to differentiation medium and
   was sustained until the completion of SMU fabrication. During this
   process, total cell proliferation was measured with a BrdU assay, and
   myogenesis and structural advancement of muscle cells were observed
   through immunostaining for MyoD, myogenin, desmin, and alpha-actinin.
   After SMU formation, isometric tetanic force production was measured to
   quantify function. The histological and functional assessment of the SMU
   showed that the administration of 10 nM DEX beginning on either day 0 or
   day 6 yielded optimal SMUs. These optimized SMUs exhibited formation of
   advanced sarcomeric structure and significant increases in myotube
   diameter and myotube fusion index, compared with untreated controls.
   Additionally, the optimized SMUs matured functionally, as indicated by a
   fivefold rise in force production. In conclusion, we have demonstrated
   that the addition of DEX to our process of engineering skeletal muscle
   tissue improves myogenesis, advances muscle structure, and increases
   force production in the resulting SMUs.}},

Abstract = {{We have seen remarkable recent progress in computational visual
   recognition, producing systems that can classify objects into thousands
   of different categories with increasing accuracy. However, one question
   that has received relatively less attention is ``what labels should
   recognition systems output?{''} This paper looks at the problem of
   predicting category labels that mimic how human observers would name
   objects. This goal is related to the concept of entry-level categories
   first introduced by psychologists in the 1970s and 1980s. We extend
   these seminal ideas to study human naming at large scale and to learn
   computational models for predicting entry-level categories. Practical
   applications of this work include improving human-focused computer
   vision applications such as automatically generating a natural language
   description for an image or text-based image search.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of rearward gap acceptance
   characteristics of drivers of large trucks in highway lane change
   scenarios. The range between the vehicles was inferred from camera
   images using the estimated lane width obtained from the lane tracking
   camera as the reference. Six-hundred lane change events were acquired
   from a large-scale naturalistic driving data set. The kinematic
   variables from the image-based gap analysis were filtered by the
   weighted linear least squares in order to extrapolate them at the lane
   change time. In addition, the time-to-collision and required
   deceleration were computed, and potential safety threshold values are
   provided. The resulting range and range rate distributions showed
   directional discrepancies, i.e., in left lane changes, large trucks are
   often slower than other vehicles in the target lane, whereas they are
   usually faster in right lane changes. Video observations have confirmed
   that major motivations for changing lanes are different depending on the
   direction of move, i.e., moving to the left (faster) lane occurs due to
   a slower vehicle ahead or a merging vehicle on the right-hand side,
   whereas right lane changes are frequently made to return to the original
   lane after passing.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene and its derivative graphene oxide (GO) have been the focus of
   attention in the field of chemical and biological sensing. In this
   paper, we report a fiber-optic sensor for chemical gas sensing by using
   graphene oxide coated microfiber knot resonator (GMKR). The refractive
   index of GO was changed when the gas molecules were adsorbed to the
   surface of GO, and the gas concentration varying induced refractive
   index change can be detected by measuring the interference fringes shift
   of the GMKR. The experimental results show the sensitivities of similar
   to 0.35pm/ppm for NH3 and similar to 0.17pm/ppm for CO detection, due to
   the different adsorption energy and charge transfer ability between the
   gas molecules and GO. Experimental results show GO is a promising
   candidate for gas sensing and can be combined with various fiber-optic
   devices due to the easy transfer process. (C) 2016 Optical Society of

   large-enrollment course. One instructor taught both sections of Biology
   101 during the same quarter, covering the same material. Students in the
   Extensive section had significantly higher mean scores on course exams.
   They also scored significantly higher on a content postassessment when
   accounting for preassessment score and student demographics. Item
   response theory analysis supported these results. Students in the
   Extensive section had greater changes in postinstruction abilities
   compared with students in the Moderate section. Finally, students in the
   Extensive section exhibited a statistically greater expert shift in
   their views about biology and learning biology. We suggest our results
   are explained by the greater number of active-learning pedagogies
   experienced by students in cooperative groups, the consistent use of
   formative assessment, and the frequent use of explicit metacognition in
   the Extensive section.}},

Abstract = {{Halogen bonding is rapidly emerging as a reliable primary interaction at
   the disposal of the supramolecular chemist. With the sigma-hole of the
   halogen atom guiding the strength and directionality of these
   interactions, current research focuses on tuning the electrostatic
   potential of the sigma-hole via molecular design. We have designed and
   synthesized 1,3,5-triiodo-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TITNB), a compound
   which, to the best of our knowledge, exhibits the largest sigma-hole
   among organic halogenated compounds. The strength of halogen bonding
   through this enhancement of the sigma-hole is demonstrated here and
   probed through eight novel cocrystals containing TITNB. These cocrystals
   exhibit notably short halogen bonds. For instance, the I center dot
   center dot center dot S interaction in TITNB-thiourea and I center dot
   center dot O- contact in TITNB-4-picoline-N-oxide are the shortest known
   in their respective categories. Moreover, the primary interactions in
   all these cocrystals exhibit hierarchical pairing based on Lewis
   basicity of the donor, highlighting a predictable chemical recognition
   with potential for use in crystal engineering. Further, interaction
   energy calculations on TITNB and other triiodoarene derivatives computed
   using ammonia as halogen bond acceptor show that TITNB-NH3 exhibits the
   most stable interaction among halogen bond acceptors.}},

Title = {{Parallel Computing Framework for Optimizing Environmental and Economic
   Performances of Housing Units}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Decision makers in the housing industry need to carefully analyze
   housing design and construction decisions to improve housing
   environmental and economic performances. Available energy optimization
   models are able to find minimum-cost housing design and construction
   decisions at different target energy-saving levels. The application of
   these models, however, is limited due to their time-intensive and often
   impractical computational requirements. This paper presents a scalable
   and expandable parallel computing framework to reduce the computational
   time that is required to optimize the trade-offs between the
   environmental performance of housing units and their initial cost. The
   framework is designed as a global parallel optimization algorithm to
   provide an efficient distribution of the multiobjective genetic
   algorithm computations over a number of parallel processors. The
   optimization algorithm is also coupled with an external building energy
   simulation engine to enable an accurate modeling of housing energy
   performance. The performance of the parallel computing framework was
   tested using seven experiments that utilized 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12
   worker processors. The results of this analysis illustrated that the
   present framework is able to reduce the computational elapsed time from
   12days to 1.7days by utilizing eight parallel worker processors that are
   commonly found on many PCs with quad core and eight threads. This
   significant reduction in the elapsed time proves that the developed
   parallel computing framework is capable of transforming the optimization
   of housing units from a time-consuming and often impractical problem to
   a feasible and practical one. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{The endothelial cells lining the capillaries supplying the brain with
   oxygen and nutrients form a formidable barrier known as the blood brain
   barrier (BBB), which exhibits selective permeability to small drug
   molecules and virtually impermeable to macromolecular therapeutics.
   Current in vitro BBB models fail to replicate this restrictive behavior
   due to poor integration of the endothelial cells with supporting cells
   (pericytes and astrocytes) following the correct anatomical organization
   observed in vivo. We report the coculture of mouse brain microvascular
   endothelial cells (b.End3), pericytes, with/without C8-D1A astrocytes in
   layered microfluidic channels forming three-dimensional (3D) bi- and
   triculture models of the BBB. The live/dead assay indicated high
   viability of all cultured cells up to 21 days. Trans-endothelial
   electrical resistance (TEER) values confirmed the formation of intact
   monolayers after 3 days in culture and showed statistically higher
   values for the triculture model compared to the single and biculture
   models. Screening the permeability of {[}C-14]-mannitol and {[}C-14]
   -urea showed the ability of bi- and triculture models to discriminate
   between different markers based on their size. Further, permeability of
   {[}C-14]-mannitol across the triculture model after 18 days in culture
   matched its reported permeability across the BBB in vivo. Mathematical
   calculations also showed that the radius of the tight junctions pores
   (R) in the triculture model is similar to the reported diameter of the
   BBB in vivo. Finally, both the bi- and triculture models exhibited
   functional expression of the P-glycoprotein efflux pump, which increased
   with the increase in the number of days in culture. These results
   collectively indicate that the triculture model is a robust in vitro
   model of the BBB.}},

Title = {{Influence of Coformer Stoichiometric Ratio on Pharmaceutical Cocrystal
   Dissolution: Three Cocrystals of Carbamazepine/4-Aminobenzoic Acid}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{990-995}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cocrystallization is a technique to optimize solid forms that shows
   great potential to improve the solubility of active pharmaceutical
   ingredients (APIs). In some systems, an API can form cocrystals in
   multiple stoichiometries with the same coformer. However, it remains
   unclear how coformer stoichiometry influences solubility. This paper
   investigates the pharmaceutical:coformer pair carbamazepine
   (CBZ)/p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA); both CBZ/PABA 1:1 and 2:1 cocrystals
   are known, and a novel 4:1 CBZ/PABA cocrystal is reported here. The 4:1
   cocrystal is structurally characterized, and phase stability data
   suggest that it is a thermodynamically unstable form. Dissolution
   experiments show that there is no correlation between the cocrystal
   stoichiometry and dissolution rate in this system. On the other hand,
   with the relatively weak intermolecular interactions, metastable forms
   can be beneficial to dissolution rate, which suggests that more effort
   should be devoted to cocrystal production with kinetic growth methods.}},

Title = {{Digitization of Electrocardiogram From Telemetry Prior to In-hospital
   Cardiac Arrest: A Pilot Study}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH FOR NURSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Background: Analyzing telemetry electrocardiogram (ECG) data over an
   extended period is often time-consuming because digital records are not
   widely available at hospitals. Investigating trends and patterns in the
   ECG data could lead to establishing predictors that would shorten
   response time to in-hospital cardiac arrest (I-HCA). This study was
   conducted to validate a novel method of digitizing paper ECG tracings
   from telemetry systems in order to facilitate the use of heart rate as a
   diagnostic feature prior to I-HCA.
   Methods: This multicenter study used telemetry to investigate
   full-disclosure ECG papers of 44 cardiovascular patients obtained within
   1 hr of I-HCA with initial rhythms of pulseless electrical activity and
   asystole. Digital ECGs were available for seven of these patients. An
   algorithm to digitize the full-disclosure ECG papers was developed using
   the shortest path method. The heart rate was measured manually
   (averaging R-R intervals) for ECG papers and automatically for digitized
   and digital ECGs.
   Results: Significant correlations were found between manual and
   automated measurements of digitized ECGs (p < .001) and between
   digitized and digital ECGs (p < .001). Bland-Altman methods showed bias
   = .001 s, SD = .0276 s, lower and upper 95\% limits of agreement for
   digitized and digital ECGs = .055 and -.053 s, and percentage error =
   0.22\%. Root mean square (rms), percentage rms difference, and signal to
   noise ratio values were in acceptable ranges.
   Conclusion: The digitization method was validated. Digitized ECG
   provides an efficient and accurate way of measuring heart rate over an
   extended period of time.}},

Abstract = {{Significant research exists regarding heat production during single-hole
   bone drilling. No published data exist regarding repetitive sequential
   drilling. This study elucidates the phenomenon of heat accumulation for
   sequential drilling with both Kirschner wires (K wires) and standard
   two-flute twist drills. It was hypothesized that cumulative heat would
   result in a higher temperature with each subsequent drill pass. Nine
   holes in a 3x3 array were drilled sequentially on moistened cadaveric
   tibia bone kept at body temperature (about 37 degrees C). Four
   thermocouples were placed at the center of four adjacent holes and 2mm
   below the surface. A battery-driven hand drill guided by a
   servo-controlled motion system was used. Six samples were drilled with
   each tool (2.0mm K wire and 2.0 and 2.5mm standard drills). K wire
   drilling increased temperature from 5 degrees C at the first hole to 20
   degrees C at holes 6 through 9. A similar trend was found in standard
   drills with less significant increments. The maximum temperatures of
   both tools increased from <0.5 degrees C to nearly 13 degrees C. The
   difference between drill sizes was found to be insignificant (P>0.05).
   In conclusion, heat accumulated during sequential drilling, with size
   difference being insignificant. K wire produced more heat than its
   twist-drill counterparts. This study has demonstrated the heat
   accumulation phenomenon and its significant effect on temperature.
   Maximizing the drilling field and reducing the number of drill passes
   may decrease bone injury. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

   tinnitus. Head or neck injuries can also trigger the development of
   tinnitus, as altered somatosensory input can affect auditory pathways
   and lead to tinnitus or modulate its intensity. Emotional and
   attentional state could be involved in the development and maintenance
   of tinnitus via top-down mechanisms. Thus, military personnel in combat
   are particularly at risk owing to combined risk factors (hearing loss,
   somatosensory system disturbances and emotional stress). Animal model
   studies have identified tinnitus-associated neural changes that commence
   at the cochlear nucleus and extend to the auditory cortex and other
   brain regions. Maladaptive neural plasticity seems to underlie these
   changes: it results in increased spontaneous firing rates and synchrony
   among neurons in central auditory structures, possibly generating the
   phantom percept. This Review highlights the links between animal and
   human studies, and discusses several therapeutic approaches that have
   been developed to target the neuroplastic changes underlying tinnitus.}},

Title = {{Tucker-tensor algorithm for large-scale Kohn-Sham density functional
   theory calculations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a systematic way of computing a low-rank
   globally adapted localized Tucker-tensor basis for solving the Kohn-Sham
   density functional theory (DFT) problem. In every iteration of the
   self-consistent field procedure of the Kohn-Sham DFT problem, we
   construct an additive separable approximation of the Kohn-Sham
   Hamiltonian. The Tucker-tensor basis is chosen such as to span the
   tensor product of the one-dimensional eigenspaces corresponding to each
   of the spatially separable Hamiltonians, and the localized Tucker-tensor
   basis is constructed from localized representations of these
   one-dimensional eigenspaces. This Tucker-tensor basis forms a complete
   basis, and is naturally adapted to the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Further,
   the locality of this basis in real-space allows us to exploit
   reduced-order scaling algorithms for the solution of the discrete
   Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem. In particular, we use Chebyshev filtering
   to compute the eigenspace of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian, and evaluate
   nonorthogonal localized wave functions spanning the Chebyshev filtered
   space, all represented in the Tucker-tensor basis. We thereby compute
   the electron-density and other quantities of interest, using a
   Fermi-operator expansion of the Hamiltonian projected onto the subspace
   spanned by the nonorthogonal localized wave functions. Numerical results
   on benchmark examples involving pseudopotential calculations suggest an
   exponential convergence of the ground-state energy with the Tucker rank.
   Interestingly, the rank of the Tucker-tensor basis required to obtain
   chemical accuracy is found to be only weakly dependent on the system
   size, which results in close to linear-scaling complexity for Kohn-Sham
   DFT calculations for both insulating and metallic systems. A comparative
   study has revealed significant computational efficiencies afforded by
   the proposed Tucker-tensor approach in comparison to a plane-wave basis.}},

Title = {{Study of the filter method for neutron pulse-height distributions
   measured with organic scintillators}},
Journal = {{RADIATION MEASUREMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{32-38}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Ltd Identification of neutron sources is of interest in several fields,
   such as homeland security or basic nuclear physics. Organic
   scintillators offer the possibility to unfold fast-neutron energy
   spectra. Since organic scintillators are sensitive to neutrons and
   gamma-rays, a method to discriminate these two types of particles is
   required. This paper is focused on investigation of the discrimination
   properties of the filter method by using a new procedure. We compare the
   results of an experimental filter method to a digital pulse-shape
   discrimination (PSD) method based on charge integration. In addition,
   these methods are compared to the simulation results obtained with the
   MCNPX-PoliMi code. The experimental and numerical investigations were
   performed with a Cf-252 spontaneous-fission neutron source. The
   integration of the number of counts gave the relative differences
   between the experimental filter and digital PSD neutron pulse-height
   distributions (PHDs) and simulated PHDs less than approximately 5\% in
   the range between 60 keVee and 1.715 MeVee of light output. Above 1.715
   MeVee, the PSD method has advantages over the filter method, due to the
   filter method having significantly worse counting statistics. The
   results show that the filter method has potential for robust neutron
   measurements when the PSD method cannot be applied, such as for `old'
   organic plastic scintillators without PSD capability. (c) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to quantify ball flight kinematics (ball
   speed, spin rate, spin axis orientation, seam orientation) and release
   location variability in the four most common pitch types in baseball and
   relate them to in-season pitching performance. Nine NCAA Division I
   pitchers threw four pitching variations (fastball, changeup, curveball,
   and slider) while a radar gun measured ball speed and a 600-Hz video
   camera recorded the ball trajectory. Marks on the ball were digitized to
   measure ball flight kinematics and release location. Ball speed was
   highest in the fastball, though spin rate was similar in the fastball
   and breaking pitches. Two distinct spin axis orientations were noted:
   one characterizing the fastball and changeup, and another, the curveball
   and slider. The horizontal release location was significantly more
   variable than the vertical release location. In-season pitching success
   was not correlated to any of the measured variables. These findings are
   instructive for inferring appropriate hand mechanics and spin types in
   each of the four pitches. Coaches should also be aware that ball flight
   kinematics might not directly relate to pitching success at the
   collegiate level. Therefore, talent identification and pitching
   evaluations should encompass other (e.g., cognitive, psychological, and
   physiological) factors.}},

Abstract = {{Predictions of a warmer climate over the Great Lakes region due to
   global change generally agree on the magnitude of temperature changes,
   but precipitation projections exhibit dependence on which General
   Circulation Models and emission scenarios are chosen. To minimize model-
   and scenario-specific biases, we combined information provided by the
   3rd phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project database.
   Specifically, the results of 12 GCMs for three emission scenarios B1,
   A1B, and A2 were analyzed for mid- (2046-2065) and end-century
   (2081-2100) intervals, for six locations of a hydroclimatic transect of
   Michigan. As a result of Bayesian Weighted Averaging, total annual
   precipitation averaged over all locations and the three emission
   scenarios increases by 7 \% (mid-)-10 \% (end-century), as compared to
   the control period (1961-1990). The projected changes across seasons are
   non-uniform and precipitation decreases by 3 \% (mid-)-5 \% (end-) for
   the months of August and September are likely. Further, average
   temperature is very likely to increase by 2.02-2.85 A degrees C by the
   mid-century and 2.58-4.73 A degrees C by the end-century. Three types of
   non-additive uncertainty sources due to climate models, anthropogenic
   forcings, and climate internal variability are addressed. When compared
   to the emission uncertainty, the relative magnitudes of the uncertainty
   types for climate model ensemble and internal variability are 149 and
   225 \% for mean monthly precipitation, and they are respectively 127 and
   123 \% for mean monthly temperature. A decreasing trend of the frost
   days and an increasing trend of the growing season length are
   identified. Also, a significant increase in the magnitude and frequency
   of heavy rainfall events is projected, with relatively more pronounced
   changes for heavy hourly rainfall as compared to daily events.
   Quantifying the inherent natural uncertainty and projecting hourly-based
   extremes, the study results deliver useful information for water
   resource stakeholders interested in impacts of climate change on
   hydro-morphological processes.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo review the scientific literature pertaining to the use of
   hand-carried and hand-held ultrasound devices in low- and middle-income
   countries (LMIC), with a focus on clinical applications, geographical
   areas of use, the impact on patient management and technical features of
   the devices used.
   MethodsThe electronic databases PubMed and Google Scholar were searched.
   No language or date restrictions were applied. Case reports and original
   research describing the use of hand-carried ultrasound devices in LMIC
   were included if agreed upon as relevant by two-reviewer consensus based
   on our predefined research questions.
   ResultsA total of 644 articles were found and screened, and 36
   manuscripts were included for final review. Twenty-seven studies were
   original research articles, and nine were case reports. Several reports
   describe the successful diagnosis and management of difficult, often
   life-threatening conditions, using hand-carried and hand-held
   ultrasound. These portable ultrasound devices have also been studied for
   cardiac screening exams, as well as a rapid triage tool in rural areas
   and after natural disaster. Most applications focus on obstetrical and
   abdominal complaints. Portable ultrasound may have an impact on clinical
   management in up to 70\% of all cases. However, no randomised controlled
   trials have evaluated the impact of ultrasound-guided diagnosis and
   treatment in resource-constrained settings. The exclusion of articles
   published in journals not listed in the large databases may have biased
   our results. Our findings are limited by the lack of higher quality
   evidence (e.g. controlled trials).
   ConclusionsHand-carried and hand-held ultrasound is successfully being
   used to triage, diagnose and treat patients with a variety of complaints
   in LMIC. However, the quality of the current evidence is low. There is
   an urgent need to perform larger clinical trials assessing the impact of
   hand-carried ultrasound in LMIC.

   Resultats644 articles ont ete trouves et analyses, 36 manuscrits ont ete

   obstetricales et abdominales. L'echographie portative peut avoir un
   impact sur la prise en charge clinique dans 70\% de tous les cas.
   Cependant, aucun essai controle randomise n'a evalue l'impact sur le
   diagnostic et le traitement guide par l'echographie dans les milieux a

   ObjetivosRevisar la literatura cientifica existente sobre el uso de
   aparatos portatiles de ultrasonido en paises con ingresos bajos y medios
   (PIBM), con especial atencion en las aplicaciones clinicas, las areas
   geograficas de uso, el impacto sobre el manejo del paciente y las
   caracteristicas tecnicas de los aparatos utilizados.
   MetodosSe realizo una busqueda en las bases de datos electronicas PubMed
   y Google Scholar. No se aplicaron restricciones de idioma o fecha. Se
   incluyeron los informes de casos y articulos originales que describian
   el uso de aparatos de ultrasonido portatiles en PIBM, si dos revisores
   estaban de acuerdo sobre su relevancia basandose en las preguntas
   predefinidas de busqueda.
   ResultadosSe encontraron y revisaron 644 articulos, y se incluyeron 36
   manuscritos en la revision final. 27 estudios eran articulos de
   investigaciones originales y 9 eran informes de casos. Varios informes
   describan el diagnostico exitoso y el manejo de condiciones dificiles, a
   menudo letales, utilizando equipos portatiles de ultrasonido. Estos
   equipos tambien han sido estudiados en pruebas de riesgo cardiaco, al
   igual que como herramientas de triaje rapido en areas rurales y despues
   de un desastre natural. La mayoria de las aplicaciones se centran en
   problemas obstetricos y abdominales. El ultrasonido portatil podria
   tener un impacto sobre el manejo clinico en hasta un 70\% de todos los
   casos. Sin embargo, ningun ensayo aleatorizado y controlado ha evaluado
   el impacto del diagnostico y el tratamiento guiado por ultrasonido en
   lugares con recursos limitados. Excluir aquellos articulos publicados en
   revistas que no figuran en las grandes bases de datos podria haber
   sesgado nuestros resultados. Nuestros hallazgos estan limitados por la
   falta de evidencia de mayor calidad (ej. ensayos controlados).
   ConclusionesEl uso de equipos de ultrasonido portatiles es exitoso para
   realizar el triaje, diagnostico y tratamiento de pacientes con una
   variedad de problemas en PIBM. Sin embargo, la calidad de la evidencia
   actualmente disponible es baja. Existe una necesidad urgente de realizar
   ensayos clinicos grandes para evaluar el impacto de equipos de
   ultrasonido portatiles en PIBM.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by applications in retail, online advertising, and cultural
   markets, this paper studies the problem of finding an optimal assortment
   and positioning of products subject to a capacity constraint in a
   setting where consumers preferences can be modeled as a discrete choice
   under a multinomial logit model that captures the intrinsic product
   appeal, position biases, and social influence. For the static problem,
   we prove that the optimal assortment and positioning can be found in
   polynomial time. This is despite the fact that adding a product to the
   assortment may increase the probability of selecting the no-choice
   option, a phenomenon not observed in almost all models studied in the
   literature. We then consider the dynamics of such a market, where
   consumers are influenced by the aggregate past purchases. In this
   dynamic setting, we provide a small example to show that the natural and
   often used policy known as popularity ranking, that ranks products in
   decreasing order of the number of purchases, can reduce the expected
   profit as times goes by. We then prove that a greedy policy that applies
   the static optimal assortment and positioning at each period, always
   benefits from the popularity signal and outperforms any policy where
   consumers cannot observe the number of past purchases (in expectation).}},

Abstract = {{Bone composition and biomechanics at the tissue-level are important
   contributors to whole bone strength. Sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) is a
   candidate anabolic therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis that
   increases bone formation, bone mass, and bone strength in animal
   studies, but its effect on bone quality at the tissue-level has received
   little attention. Pre-clinical studies of Scl-Ab have recently expanded
   to include diseases with altered collagen and material properties such
   as osteogenesis imperfecta (01). The purpose of this study was to
   investigate the role of Scl-Ab on bone quality by determining bone
   material composition and tissue-level mechanical properties in normal
   wild type (WT) tissue, as well as mice with a typical 01 Gly -> Cys
   mutation (Brtl/+) in type I collagen. Rapidly growing (3-week-old) and
   adult (6-month-old) WT and Brtl/+ mice were treated for 5 weeks with
   Sd-Ab. Fluorescent guided tissue-level bone composition analysis (Raman
   spectroscopy) and biomechanical testing (nanoindentation) were performed
   at multiple tissue ages. Scl-Ab increased mineral to matrix in adult WT
   and Brtl/+ at tissue ages of 2-4 wks. However, no treatment related
   changes were observed in mineral to matrix levels at mid-cortex, and
   elastic modulus was not altered by Scl-Ab at any tissue age. Increased
   mineral-to-matrix was phenotypically observed in adult Brtl/+ OI mice
   (at tissue ages > 3 wks) and rapidly growing Brtl/+ (at tissue ages > 4
   wks) mice compared to WT. At identical tissue ages defined by
   fluorescent labels, adult mice had generally lower mineral to matrix
   ratios and a greater elastic modulus than rapidly growing mice,
   demonstrating that bone matrix quality can be influenced by animal age
   and tissue age alike. In summary, these data suggest that Scl-Ab alters
   the matrix chemistry of newly formed bone while not affecting the
   elastic modulus, induces similar changes between Brtl/+ and WT mice, and
   provides new insight into the interaction between tissue age and animal
   age on bone quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modern signal processing (SP) methods rely very heavily on probability
   and statistics to solve challenging SP problems. SP methods are now
   expected to deal with ever more complex models, requiring ever more
   sophisticated computational inference techniques. This has driven the
   development of statistical SP methods based on stochastic simulation and
   optimization. Stochastic simulation and optimization algorithms are
   computationally intensive tools for performing statistical inference in
   models that are analytically intractable and beyond the scope of
   deterministic inference methods. They have been recently successfully
   applied to many difficult problems involving complex statistical models
   and sophisticated (often Bayesian) statistical inference techniques.
   This survey paper offers an introduction to stochastic simulation and
   optimization methods in signal and image processing. The paper addresses
   a variety of high-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods as
   well as deterministic surrogate methods, such as variational Bayes, the
   Bethe approach, belief and expectation propagation and approximate
   message passing algorithms. It also discusses a range of optimization
   methods that have been adopted to solve stochastic problems, as well as
   stochastic methods for deterministic optimization. Subsequently, areas
   of overlap between simulation and optimization, in particular
   optimization-within-MCMC and MCMC-driven optimization are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Supercapacitors benefit from unique features including high power
   density, long cycle life, wide temperature operation range, durability
   in harsh environments, efficient cycling, and low maintenance cost. This
   paper presents a validated lumped and computationally efficient
   electrical and thermal model for a cylindrical supercapacitor cell. The
   electrical model is a two-state equivalent electric circuit model with
   three parameters that are identified using temporal experiments. The
   dependence of the parameters on the state of charge, current direction
   and magnitude (20-200 A), and temperatures ranging from -40 degrees C to
   60 degrees C is incorporated in the model. The thermal model is a linear
   1-D model with two states. The reversible heat generation which is
   significant in double-layer capacitors is included in the thermal model.
   The coupling of the two models enables tuning of the
   temperature-dependent parameters of the electrical model in real time.
   The coupled electrothermal model is validated using real-world duty
   cycles at subzero and room temperatures with root-mean-square errors of
   (82 mV-87 mV) and (0.17 degrees C-0.21 degrees C) for terminal voltage
   and temperature, respectively. This accurate model is implementable in
   real-time power applications and also thermal management studies of
   supercapacitor packs.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of communication over a three-user discrete
   memoryless interference channel (3-IC). The current known coding
   techniques for communicating over an arbitrary 3-IC are based on message
   splitting, superposition coding, and binning using independent and
   identically distributed (i.i.d.) random codebooks. In this paper, we
   propose a new ensemble of codes-partitioned coset codes (PCCs)-that
   possess an appropriate mix of empirical and algebraic closure
   properties. We develop coding techniques that exploit the algebraic
   closure property of PCC to enable interference alignment over general
   3-IC. We analyze the performance of the proposed coding technique to
   derive an achievable rate region for the general discrete 3-IC. Additive
   and non-additive examples are identified for which the derived
   achievable rate region is the capacity, moreover, strictly larger than
   the current known largest achievable rate regions based on the i.i.d.
   random codebooks.}},

Abstract = {{The spray-interactive flamelet and extended multi-zone combustion models
   coupled with multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics are applied
   to investigate the effects of charge stratification in a
   direct-injection compression ignition engine under low load conditions.
   A parametric study was carried out in order to compare the two
   approaches for early and late fuel injection timings. Comparison of
   numerical results with available experimental data shows that for early
   fuel injection, both models predict the auto-ignition and combustion
   characteristics with comparable fidelity. As the fuel injection timing
   is delayed, however, the spray-interactive flamelet model is found to
   capture the onset of combustion and subsequent heat release with greater
   accuracy. Further investigation reveals that the better performance of
   the spray-interactive flamelet model over a wider range of
   mixture-stratified conditions is mainly attributed to its ability to
   capture the diffusive transport resulting from small-scale mixing and
   turbulence-chemistry interaction, which becomes more important when
   significant mixture inhomogeneities exist in the engine cylinder.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors present a physical model developed to teach
   surgeons the requisite drilling techniques when using an endoscopic
   endonasal approach (EEA) to the skull base. EEA is increasingly used for
   treating pathologies of the ventral and ventrolateral cranial base.
   Endonasal drilling is a unique skill in terms of the instruments used,
   the long reach required, and the restricted angulation, and gaining
   competency requires much practice. Based on the successful experience in
   creating custom simulators, the authors used 3D printing to build an EEA
   training model from post-processed thin-cut head CT scans, formulating
   the materials to provide realistic haptic feedback and endoscope
   handling. They performed a preliminary assessment at 2 institutions to
   evaluate content validity of the simulator as the first step of the
   validation process. Overall results were positive, particularly in terms
   of bony landmarks and haptic response, though minor refinements were
   suggested prior to use as a training device.}},

Title = {{Environmental stochasticity controls soil erosion variability}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Understanding soil erosion by water is essential for a range of research
   areas but the predictive skill of prognostic models has been repeatedly
   questioned because of scale limitations of empirical data and the high
   variability of soil loss across space and time scales. Improved
   understanding of the underlying processes and their interactions are
   needed to infer scaling properties of soil loss and better inform
   predictive methods. This study uses data from multiple environments to
   highlight temporal-scale dependency of soil loss: erosion variability
   decreases at larger scales but the reduction rate varies with
   environment. The reduction of variability of the geomorphic response is
   attributed to a `compensation effect': temporal alternation of events
   that exhibit either source-limited or transport-limited regimes. The
   rate of reduction is related to environment stochasticity and a novel
   index is derived to reflect the level of variability of intra-and
   inter-event hydrometeorologic conditions. A higher stochasticity index
   implies a larger reduction of soil loss variability (enhanced
   predictability at the aggregated temporal scales) with respect to the
   mean hydrologic forcing, offering a promising indicator for estimating
   the degree of uncertainty of erosion assessments.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated nonisothermal (fast) and nominally isothermal
   hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Nannochloropsis sp. microalgae for
   the production of biocrude. Biocrude yields ranged from 36 to 45 wt \%

   yield. This condition also gave the biocrude with the lowest heating
   value, which indicates there are compromises to be made between biocrude
   quantity and quality. The aqueous phase and biocrude product fractions
   were characterized using elemental analysis and Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). This detailed level
   of analysis identified more than 30,000 unique molecular products. The
   aqueous phase products included compounds with the same molecular
   formulae as known herbicides, which may inform efforts in genetic
   engineering of algae and/or bacteria for cultivation on the aqueous

   clues regarding the types of reactions that may take place during HTL.

Title = {{Segmentation of contacting soil particles in images by modified
   watershed analysis}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{142-152}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Image-based soil particle size and shape characterization relies on
   computer methods to process and analyze the images. For contacting
   particles spread on a flat surface this requires delineation of particle
   boundaries through shape-based image segmentation. The traditional
   method using watershed analysis fails for particles that have
   constrictions (are peanut-shaped). The oversegmentation interprets such
   particles as being two, thereby underestimating the long particle
   dimension by about 50\% and overestimating particle sphericity by about
   a factor of two. This paper presents a solution to the problem of
   oversegmentation through morphologic reconstruction. The key to this
   improvement is distinguishing the necks in peanut shaped particles from
   actual contacts between particles. A parameter a is defined to quantify
   the necks and contacts. Approximately 220,000 particles in a range of
   2.0-35.0 mm having various shapes and angularities were studied to find
   typical a values for necks and contacts. An algorithm is proposed to
   correct the oversegmentation based on a. The results show that this
   improved watershed analysis accurately segments sand particles at
   contacts while preserving the continuity of peanut shaped particles.
   Example lab tests demonstrate the significance of the problem and its
   solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of plastic deformation on the evolution of wear and local stress
   fields in fretting}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{During fretting, the removal of material by wear leads to an increase of
   contact stress in the stick zone. If elastic behavior is assumed, the
   boundary between stick and slip zones does not move, wear eventually
   ceases, and a mode-I singularity of contact pressure is predicted after
   infinitely many cycles.
   For real materials, the development of singular stresses must be limited
   by plastic deformation. Here we investigate the effect of plasticity on
   fretting wear, using a finite-element model. We find that the principal
   effect of plasticity is to allow the wear scar to extend continuously
   into the contact region. Thus, wear continues indefinitely, and
   extensive damage or catastrophic failure is to be anticipated, given a
   sufficient number of fretting cycles.
   In the elastic regime, the results can be cast in dimensionless terms,
   permitting application to any material or loading condition. Plasticity
   introduces an additional dimensionless parameter into the analysis, but
   results of considerable generality can still be obtained. In particular,
   the contact pressure distribution exhibits a stable maximum related to
   the yield strength of the material, and the maximum accumulated plastic
   strain increases approximately linearly with the number of loading
   cycles and occurs close to the instantaneous slip-stick boundary. (C)

Abstract = {{Iron-chromium-aluminum (FeCrAl) coatings deposited on Zircaloy 2 (Zy2)
   and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) by magnetron sputtering have been
   tested with respect to oxidation weight gain in high-temperature steam.
   In addition, autoclave testing of FeCrAl-coated Zy2 coupons under
   pressure-temperature-dissolved oxygen coolant conditions representative
   of a boiling water reactor (BWR) environment has been performed. Four
   different FeCrAl compositions have been tested in 700 degrees C steam;
   compositions that promote alumina formation inhibited oxidation of the
   underlying Zy2. Parabolic growth kinetics of alumina on FeCrAl-coated
   Zy2 is quantified via elemental depth profiling. Autoclave testing under
   normal BWR operating conditions (288 degrees C, 9.5 MPa with normal

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of
   patients with early-stage lung cancer and to show that sampling
   pulmonary vein (PV) blood using microfluidic chip technology will yield
   significantly more CTCs. Improving early detection of lung cancer is
   critical to improving lung cancer survival. Reproducible detection of
   CTCs is limited currently in early stage tumors.
   Methods: Patients undergoing pulmonary resection had PV blood drawn
   before resection. Peripheral blood was sampled at preoperative,
   intraoperative, and postoperative times. Samples were analyzed on
   microfluidic chips using antibody-based capture.
   Results: A total of 32 patients with primary lung cancer were evaluated.
   Twenty patients had 1 or more CTCs detected in at least 1 sample
   (62.5\%). The mean number of CTCs from peripheral vein sources at the
   preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative time points was 1.3,
   1.9, and 0.6 respectively. The average number of CTCs in the PV was
   340.0 (range, 0.0-5422.50; P>.01). When PV CTCs were present, the number
   of CTCs was correlated with pathological tumor size (P = .0236). The
   number of PV CTCs was not correlated with any other clinical feature
   (eg, smoking status, preoperative or postoperative stage). Furthermore,
   the number of PV CTCs was significantly higher when preoperative
   bronchoscopic biopsy was performed, compared with computed
   tomography-guided biopsy (P = .0311). Seven patients had evidence of CTC
   clusters, or microemboli.
   Conclusions: With a single vein draining the entire tumor basin, lung
   cancers are unique, allowing the high-yield isolation of CTCs from the
   PV. This method may facilitate future studies to improve the detection
   and analysis of early-stage lung CTCs.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{13-22}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{MAX phases are a class of ternary compounds, known to exhibit combined
   properties of both ceramics and metals. This class of materials has a
   low symmetry crystal structure (hexagonal close packed), which
   facilitates limited slip, thereby causing deformation to proceed via
   unconventional ductile modes, such as kink band formations at the
   nano-scale. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the strain evolution
   in two MAX phases (Ti(2)AIC and Ti3SiC2) is presented using the
   full-field, non-contact technique of Digital Image Correlation (DIC).
   Strain measurements are performed using 2D DIC to capture localized
   features of deformation and a validation of the method is also provided
   using a 3D DIC technique. The results show that beyond a certain stress
   level, heterogeneous strain fields are present, the underlying origins
   of which can be related to lower length scales. The analysis presented
   here reveals a meso-structure comprising of hard and soft grain
   clusters, which contribute towards heterogeneous strain fields at the
   macro-scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a decentralized shape and vibration controller for
   structures with large and potentially unknown system order,
   model-parameter uncertainty, and unknown disturbances. Controller
   implementation utilizes distributed, colocated, and independent
   actuator-sensor pairs. Controller design requires knowledge of the
   relative degrees of the actuator and sensor dynamics and upper bounds on
   the diagonal elements of system's high-frequency gain matrix.
   Closed-loop performance is determined by a parameter gain, which can be
   viewed as the cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter. For sufficiently
   large parameter gain, the closed-loop performance is arbitrarily small.
   Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the application and
   effectiveness of the decentralized controller, and we present
   experimental results for a setup consisting of a cantilever beam with
   piezoelectric actuators and strain-gauge sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Methanotrophs have remarkable redundancy in multiple steps of the
   central pathway of methane oxidation to carbon dioxide. For example, it
   has been known for over 30 years that two forms of methane
   monooxygenase, responsible for oxidizing methane to methanol, exist in
   methanotrophs, i.e., soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and
   particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), and that expression of these
   two forms is controlled by the availability of copper. Specifically,
   sMMO expression occurs in the absence of copper, while pMMO expression
   increases with increasing copper concentrations. More recently, it was
   discovered that multiple forms of methanol dehydrogenase (MeDH), Mxa
   MeDH and Xox MeDH, also exist in methanotrophs and that the expression
   of these alternative forms is regulated by the availability of cerium.
   That is, expression of Xox MeDH increases in the presence of cerium,
   while Mxa MeDH expression decreases in the presence of cerium. As it had
   been earlier concluded that pMMO and Mxa MeDH form a supercomplex in
   which electrons from Mxa MeDH are back donated to pMMO to drive the
   initial oxidation of methane, we speculated that Mxa MeDH could be
   rendered inactive through marker-exchange mutagenesis but growth on
   methane could still be possible if cerium was added to increase the
   expression of Xox MeDH under sMMO-expressing conditions. Here we report
   that mxaF, encoding the large subunit of Mxa MeDH, could indeed be
   knocked out in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, yet growth on methane
   was still possible, so long as cerium was added. Interestingly, growth
   of this mutant occurred in both the presence and the absence of copper,
   suggesting that Xox MeDH can replace Mxa MeDH regardless of the form of
   MMO expressed.}},

   examine both the vertical contact and horizontal contact structures,

   degree of current crowding in the bottom horizontal contact in
   nanolasers are much larger than those in the top vertical contact. For
   both contacts, constriction resistance and, therefore, the degree of
   current crowding increase as the nanolaser radius decreases, the amount
   of undercut increases, or the angle (either positive or negative) of the
   sidewall tilt increases. The location where most current crowding and
   most Joule heating occur is identified. The results may provide insights
   into the design optimization of nanolasers.}},

Abstract = {{Myelofibrosis (MF) is a hematologic neoplasm arising as a primary
   disease or secondary to other blood malignancies. Both primary and
   secondary MF develop progressive fibrosis of bone marrow, displacing
   normal hematopoietic cells to other organs and disrupting normal
   production of mature blood cells. Activation of JAK2 signaling in
   hematopoietic stem cells commonly causes MF, and ruxolitinib, a drug
   targeting this pathway, is the preferred treatment for many patients.
   However, current measures of disease status in MF do not necessarily
   predict response to treatment with ruxolitinib or other drugs. Bone
   marrow biopsies are invasive and prone to sampling error, while
   measurements of spleen volume only indirectly reflect status of bone
   marrow. Toward the goal of developing an imaging biomarker for treatment
   response in MF, we present preliminary results from a prospective
   clinical study evaluating parametric response mapping (PRM) of
   quantitative Dixon MRI bone marrow fat fraction maps in four MF patients
   treated with ruxolitinib. PRM allows voxel-wise identification of
   temporal changes in quantitative imaging readouts, in this case bone
   marrow fat. We identified heterogeneous responses of bone marrow fat
   among patients and within different bone marrow sites in the same
   patient. Changes in bone marrow fat fraction also were discordant with
   reductions in spleen volume, the standard imaging metric for treatment
   response. This study provides initial support for PRM analysis of
   quantitative MRI of bone marrow fat to monitor therapy in MF, setting
   the stage for larger studies to further develop and validate this method
   as a complementary imaging biomarker.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical difficulties, including underflow, drift, jump and numerical
   noise are encountered near transitions between slip and stick when
   conventional numerical integration methods are employed to yield the
   response for a frictional system (Barber and Wang, 2014). We present a
   new algorithm for two-dimensional frictional problems by making use of a
   series of closed form analytical solutions (Wang, 2014), which have been
   derived for a mass in sliding contact loaded by a constant external
   force. This algorithm can be used to yield the response of the system
   during dynamic slip periods including an accurate determination of the
   time and position of slip/stick transitions. We also develop an
   analytical patch for the recommencement of slip after stick, since zero
   initial velocity at the boundary of friction circle results in
   difficulties for both analytical (Wang, 2014) and numerical solutions
   (jump phenomenon) (Barber and Wang, 2014). A two-state boolean variable
   B is introduced to toggle between states of stick (B = 0) and slip (B =
   1). The proposed new algorithm is explained using a flow chart. Accuracy
   and efficiency of the new algorithm are assessed by comparison with
   traditional algorithms in several examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Flexurally-triggered punching shear failure of reinforced concrete
   slab-column connections reinforced with headed shear studs arranged in
   orthogonal and radial layouts}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{110}},

Abstract = {{Shear strength of reinforced concrete slab-column connections can be
   increased through the use of headed shear studs. To reduce interference
   with slab flexural reinforcement, stud rails are often placed in an
   orthogonal layout. In this layout, no stud rail is placed in regions
   extending from the corners of a column, as opposed to stud placement in
   a radial layout. Some experiments have found the absence of radial stud
   rails could lead to premature shear failure at slab-column connections.
   This problem may not have been noticeable in experiments that tested
   slabs with either short-spans or with a high flexural reinforcement
   ratio. This paper presents an experimental study to evaluate the
   effectiveness of these stud layouts in slab-column connections whose
   slabs have relatively low flexural reinforcement ratios. Three
   full-scale slab-column connections that represent a flat plate structure
   with 25 ft (7620 mm) spans were tested. All three specimens had an
   identical flexural design, in which the reinforcement ratio was 0.8\%.
   One specimen was built without shear reinforcement, and the remaining
   two specimens were reinforced with shear studs in either a radial or
   orthogonal layout. For the specimens with shear studs, calculated shear
   strengths were higher than their estimated flexural strengths. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Systems characterized by the governing equation of the bistable,
   double-well Duffing oscillator are ever-present throughout the fields of
   science and engineering. While the prediction of the transient dynamics
   of these strongly nonlinear oscillators has been a particular research
   interest, the sufficiently accurate reconstruction of the dissipative
   behaviors continues to be an unrealized goal. In this study, an enhanced
   averaging method using Jacobian elliptic functions is presented to
   faithfully predict the transient, dissipative dynamics of a bistable
   Duffing oscillator. The analytical approach is uniquely applied to
   reconstruct the intrawell and interwell dynamic regimes. By relaxing the
   requirement for small variation of the transient, averaged parameters in
   the proposed solution formulation, the resulting analytical predictions
   are in excellent agreement with exact trajectories of displacement and
   velocity determined via numerical integration of the governing equation.
   A wide range of system parameters and initial conditions are utilized to
   assess the accuracy and computational efficiency of the analytical
   method, and the consistent agreement between numerical and analytical
   results verifies the robustness of the proposed method. Although the
   analytical formulations are distinct for the two dynamic regimes, it is
   found that directly splicing the inter- and intrawell predictions
   facilitates good agreement with the exact dynamics of the full
   reconstructed, transient trajectory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a simplistic passive dynamic model that is able to
   create realistic quadrupedal walking, tolting, and trotting motions. The
   model is inspired by the bipedal spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP)
   model and consists of a distributed mass on four massless legs. Each of
   the legs is either in ground contact, retracted for swing, or is ready
   for touch down with a predefined angle of attack. Different gaits, that
   is, periodic motions differing in interlimb coordination patterns, are
   generated by choosing different initial model states. Contact patterns
   and ground reaction forces (GRFs) evolve solely from these initial
   conditions. By identifying appropriate system parameters in an
   optimization framework, the model is able to closely match
   experimentally recorded vertical GRFs of walking and trotting of
   Warmblood horses, and of tolting of Icelandic horses. In a detailed
   study, we investigated the sensitivity of the obtained solutions with
   respect to all states and parameters and quantified the improvement in
   fitting GRF by including an additional head and neck segment. Our work
   suggests that quadrupedal gaits are merely different dynamic modes of
   the same structural system and that we can interpret different gaits as
   different nonlinear elastic oscillations that propel an animal forward.}},

Abstract = {{Core needle biopsy (CNB) is widely used in active surveillance, which is
   the current standard of care for low risk prostate cancers. A longer
   biopsy sample length may improve the accuracy of diagnosis. To increase
   the biopsy sample length, the magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF)
   technique was applied to decrease the needle inner friction force, which
   may hinder the tissue from entering the lumen of the biopsy needle. To
   assess the effectiveness of these MAF polished needles as compared to
   the unpolished needles, a method to measure the three components of
   axial force during hollow needle insertion-tip cutting force, inner
   friction force, and outer friction force-was developed. Six
   tissue-mimicking samples of different lengths were used to find the
   linear relationship between the sum of the cutting force and inner
   friction force and the phantom length or contact length. Linear
   regression method was used to extrapolate and estimate the tip cutting
   force and the inner friction force. With this method, the difference
   between the inner friction force of the needles with and without
   polishing was found. The results showed that the unpolished needles had
   an inner friction force 40-50\% higher and a tip cutting force 22\%
   higher than their MAF polished counterparts. We also found that MAF
   polished needles had an average of 9\% longer contact length between the
   sample and the inner wall than unpolished needles, indicating that a
   longer sample can be extracted at a lower friction force. The results of
   our investigation implied that reducing the inner surface roughness of a
   biopsy needle could reduce inner friction forces.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing consensus that individuals egressing during emergencies
   engage in social collective behavior that is ordered and cooperative.
   Despite this fact however, a great many of the existing models either do
   not account for this type of behavior or model it in an inadequate
   manner. In this paper, a leader-follower agent-based model is proposed
   to interpret local social interactions and collective behavior and then
   use this information to mimic three particular scenarios: lining up in
   counter-flow, queuing, and collective mobility. To achieve this, a
   pedestrian agent can establish informal and transient leader-follower
   relationships with others while adjusting its behavioral patterns as
   warranted by the situation. The proposed model is calibrated to existing
   field data and then validated using another set of field data, where it
   is shown that the new model is capable of reasonably simulating social
   collective behavior during egress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   particle aggregate size, light absorbance and pH. The thermal
   conductivity and viscosity of the nano-fluid samples were measured.
   10.9\% enhancement in thermal conductivity was observed in ethylene
   glycol-distilled water mixture based nano-fluid with 5 wt.\% Al2O3
   nano-particle loading. The results show multiple perspective
   correlations between nano-fluid characteristics and thermal properties.
   The findings are summarized as follows. Combined effect of base fluid
   viscosity and particle surface charge determines the degree of
   nano-particle aggregation. Higher enhancement in thermal conductivity is
   observed with moderate particle aggregation, while either light or heavy
   aggregation lowers the enhancement. The ethylene glycol-water mixture
   based nano-fluids show overall higher thermal conductivity enhancement
   than the distilled water and ethylene glycol based nano-fluids. The
   degradation of nano-fluid thermal conductivity enhancement over time is
   found to be related to the gravity-driven particle sedimentation.
   Nano-fluids containing larger particle aggregates show higher viscosity
   augmentation. However, the extent of viscosity augmentation is not
   proportional to the extent of particle aggregation. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Alginate was studied as a degradable nerve guidance scaffold material in
   vitro and in vivo. In vitro degradation rates were determined using
   rheology to measure the change in shear modulus vs time. The shear
   modulus decreased from 155 kPa to 5 kPa within 2 days; however, alginate
   samples maintained their superficial geometry for over 28 days. The
   degradation behavior was supported by materials characterization data
   showing alginate consisted of high internal surface area (400 m(2)/g),
   which likely facilitated the release of cross-linking cations resulting
   in the rapid decrease in shear modulus. To assess the degradation rate
   in vivo, multilumen scaffolds were fabricated using a fiber templating
   technique. The scaffolds were implanted in a 2-mm-long T3 full
   transection rodent spinal cord lesion model for 14 days. Although there
   was some evidence of axon guidance, in general, alginate scaffolds
   degraded before axons could grow over the 2-mm-long lesion. Enabling
   alginate-based scaffolds for nerve repair will likely require approaches
   to slow its degradation. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater

Abstract = {{Usernames and passwords stubbornly remain the most prevalent
   authentication mechanism. Password secrecy ensures that only genuine
   users are granted access. If the secret is breached, impostors gain the
   access too. One method of strengthening password authentication is
   through keystroke dynamics. Keystroke dynamics algorithms typically
   constrain the authentication entry to one valid sequence of key presses.
   In this paper, we introduce the concept of event sequences. We explore
   the nature of variations between multiple valid key-entry sequences and
   propose a scheme that effectively represents these variations. We test
   the efficacy of the new authentication method in distinguishing users.
   The experimental results show that typing proficiency of individuals is
   not the only determining authentication factor. We show that typing
   sequence variations contain sufficient discriminatory information to
   warrant their inclusion into user authentication methods. Based on these
   results, we present a novel strategy to create feature vectors for
   keystroke dynamics-based authentication. The proposed approach ensures
   that the feature vector's length and structure are related only to the
   length of the password, independent of its content or the order of keys
   pressed. This normalization of feature vector structure has multiple
   advantages including leveraging the discriminatory power of event
   sequences, faster search-and-retrieval in n-graph-based authentication
   systems, and simplicity. The proposed authentication scheme is
   applicable to both static and continual authentication systems.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{437-451}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies how the control algorithm impacts the required
   capacity of battery energy storage system (BESS) to mitigate wind
   intermittency. We study a futuristic scenario in which wind generation
   is traded in the energy market on an hourly basis, and the wind power
   producer has to procure reserves to handle wind fluctuations. The wind
   power producer can avoid paying for conventional reserves by
   charging/discharging BESS to compensate for wind surplus and deficit. We
   develop control algorithms using the model predictive control (MPC)
   methodology, which incorporates wind forecasts for the next few hours
   when determining wind scheduling. The MPC algorithm is developed by
   solving a non-linear optimization problem to minimize operation costs to
   the wind power producer. In addition to operation costs, the MPC
   algorithm considers two practical aspects: the efficiency loss of BESS
   and the smoothness in wind power scheduling. BESS sizing is studied by
   parametric analyses. Simulations show that BESS is more effective in
   reducing operation costs and reducing wind curtailment than conventional
   reserves. In addition, MPC is a horizon-based control algorithm and can
   preview future information in its control action. Simulations also show
   that MPC consistently outperforms an instantaneous heuristic algorithm
   that does not use future information. Therefore, we confirm that MPC can
   reduce the BESS capacity required to cover wind uncertainties. Copyright

Title = {{Defect microstructural equivalence in molybdenum under different
   irradiation conditions at low temperatures and low doses}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{47-53}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Owing to its advantages such as higher dose rates and shorter time
   required, ion irradiation, including in-situ ion irradiation of
   nano-foils on electron microscopes, is being proposed as a surrogate for
   neutron/reactor irradiation in materials testing for the research of
   irradiation induced/enhanced degradation of reactor structural
   materials. This raises a key question: can the microstructural evolution
   be matched across different irradiation conditions? Here we report our
   recent study using a rate-theory based cluster dynamics approach on the
   time dependent defect accumulation in elemental molybdenum under varying
   ion and neutron irradiation conditions, within a low temperature and low
   dose regime. The approach solves a large system of coupled differential
   equations each equation describing the rate of change in the
   concentration of a particular defect/cluster (defined by its nature and
   number of constituent point defects) caused by direct production (for
   primary defects), diffusion flux across spatial grids (for mobile
   defects, under ion irradiation), and capturing and/or emission
   interactions with other defects/clusters. Our results suggest that
   defect evolution under different dose rates can be very well matched in
   either thin foil ion irradiation or bulk neutron irradiation, by using
   different irradiation temperatures to counteract the effect of the dose
   rate variation. Across the two types of irradiation, less perfect
   matching is obtained mainly due to the strong surface sink effect in the
   thin foil, but the matching can be improved by combining the temperature
   shift strategy with selection of a single depth in the foil (as opposed
   to all depths averaged) for matching, or a greater foil thickness. (C)

Title = {{A method for indoor navigation based on magnetic beacons using
   smartphones and tablets}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{197-209}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Outdoor navigation using GPS receivers installed in various types of
   consumer electronics devices, especially smartphones and tablet
   computers has become very common. However, indoor navigation can be
   problematic as GPS signals are blocked by ceilings and building walls
   and accuracy is on the order of building dimensions. In present work we
   propose using an array of magnetic beacons for localizing a receiver
   equipped with a magnetic sensor. A smartphone or a tablet computer with
   an internal magnetometer can be employed as a receiver. Exploiting
   smartphones and tablets for indoor navigation is a great advantage when
   considering convenience, simplicity and low cost. The navigation area is
   covered by magnetic beacons deployed in known locations. Each beacon
   generates an AC magnetic field with a unique signature enabling the
   receiver to distinguish between beacons. The signature may feature a
   specific single frequency tone, a combination of frequencies, or any
   other modulated signal. A software application running on the receiver
   enables self-localization by means of detection and identification of
   the nearest beacon. A system prototype has been developed and used to
   test the proposed method in field conditions. Experimental results show
   successful localization, which paves the way for a full scale
   development of an effective indoor navigation system. The good results
   together with simple implementation make the proposed method attractive
   for a wide range of indoor localization applications, including:
   pedestrian and robot navigation, inbuilding rescue missions, vision
   impaired assistance, and location aware services, just to mention a few.

Abstract = {{Although color and appearance have a psychological component, they are
   material properties that can be of considerable significance and
   economic importance to designers. Paint systems are materials that have
   a primary role of modifying the appearance of an engineering structure.
   The determination of structure-property relationships is recognized as a
   defining feature for different branches of materials science. These
   relationships are at the heart of the predictive models required for the
   development of new materials. Here we explore some of the
   microstructural parameters that control the appearance of
   platelet-containing paint systems. The orientation of platelets is a
   microstructural property known to affect the appearance of
   platelet-containing paints. However, prior works examined only a limited
   set of samples. Additionally, they did not identify other potential
   microstructural/formulation changes that could affect the relationship
   between orientation and appearance. In this paper, the orientation of
   the platelets was verified to be the major microstructural parameter
   that influenced the lightness of the paint system. In addition, the
   strength of this influence was shown to vary because of specific
   formulation changes, such as platelet size and volume fraction. The
   relationship between orientation and appearance was shown to depend on
   an additional microstructural property that is related to the size of
   the gaps between the platelets. We termed this additional
   microstructural property the gap factor. The size of the gaps between
   the platelets, and the coverage/shadowing of platelets by other
   platelets, was found to affect the scattering behavior of the system,
   particularly near the specular reflection direction. For example, larger
   gaps increase the probability of multiple reflections between the
   platelets. These results will guide the on-going work to develop
   improved structure-property relationships. Improved structure-property
   relationships are expected to provide more accurate models for the
   appearance of platelet-containing paint systems.}},

Title = {{LSSLP - Local structure sensitive label propagation}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{332}},
Pages = {{19-32}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Label propagation is an approach to iteratively spread the prior state
   of label confidence associated with each of samples to its neighbors
   until achieving a global convergence state. Such process has been shown
   to hold close connection with a general graph-based regularization
   framework. Within this framework, a closed- form linear system can be
   built to carry out label propagation. In this paper, to address several
   issues inherent with previous graph-based label propagation framework,
   we propose a reformulated one, i.e., local structure sensitive label
   propagation (LSSLP). By associating each graph vertex with a local
   structure sensitive tuning factor, the empirical loss error on each
   vertex can be controlled preferably to keep consistent with the commonly
   preconditioned `cluster assumption' of data structure. Out of
   consideration for information conservation, we relax the state
   conservation constraint of label confidence from labeled samples
   proposed by Belkin etal. (2004) to a more general form. Meanwhile, an
   inverse-warping procedure is incorporated into the proposed local
   structure sensitive label propagation framework to maintain large and
   stable enough classification margin. Based on the felicitous inversion
   technique for blocked matrix, we extend LSSLP to its incremental and
   inductive versions and also present computationally efficient
   implementation of it. Experimental results demonstrate the performance
   of the reformulated regularization framework for label propagation is
   much competitive. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   was observed to increase with increasing humidity for samples with low
   PSS content and decrease for samples with high PSS content. Measurements
   on thick films soaked by various polar solvents likewise showed an
   enhancement in power factor. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Features of primary damage by high energy displacement cascades in
   concentrated Ni-based alloys}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Alloying of Ni with Fe or Co has been shown to reduce primary damage
   production under ion irradiation. Similar results have been obtained
   from classical molecular dynamics simulations of 1, 10, 20, and 40 keV
   collision cascades in Ni, NiFe, and NiCo. In all cases, a mix of
   imperfect stacking fault tetrahedra, faulted loops with a 1/3  111 
   Burgers vector, and glissile interstitial loops with a 1/2  110  Burgers
   vector were formed, along with small sessile point defect complexes and
   clusters. Primary damage reduction occurs by three mechanisms. First,
   Ni-Co, Ni-Fe, Co-Co, and Fe-Fe short-distance repulsive interactions are
   stiffer than Ni-Ni interactions, which lead to a decrease in damage
   formation during the transition from the supersonic ballistic regime to
   the sonic regime. This largely controls final defect production. Second,
   alloying decreases thermal conductivity, leading to a longer thermal
   spike lifetime. The associated annealing reduces final damage
   production. These two mechanisms are especially important at cascades
   energies less than 40 keV. Third, at the higher energies, the production
   of large defect clusters by subcascades is inhibited in the alloys. A
   number of challenges and limitations pertaining to predictive atomistic
   modeling of alloys under high-energy particle irradiation are discussed.

Title = {{A unified multicomponent stress-diffusion model of drug release from
   non-biodegradable polymeric matrix tablets}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{224}},
Pages = {{43-58}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{We propose a new transport model of drug release from hydrophilic
   polymeric matrices, based on Stefan-Maxwell flux laws for multicomponent
   transport. Polymer stress is incorporated in the total mixing free
   energy, which contributes directly to the diffusion driving force while
   leading to time-dependent boundary conditions at the tablet interface.
   Given that hydrated matrix tablets are dense multicomponent systems,
   extended Stefan-Maxwell (ESM) flux laws are adopted to ensure
   consistency with the Onsager reciprocity principle and the Gibbs-Duhem
   thermodynamic constraint. The ESM flux law for any given component takes
   into account the friction exerted by all other species and is invariant
   with respect to reference velocity, thus satisfying Galilean
   translational invariance. Our model demonstrates that penetrant-induced
   plasticization of polymer chains partially or even entirely offsets the
   steady decline of chemical potential gradients at the tablet-medium
   interface that drive drug release. Utilizing a Flory-Huggins
   thermodynamic model, a modified form of the upper convected Maxwell
   constitutive equation for polymer stress and a Fujita-type dependence of
   mutual diffusivities on composition, depending on parameters, Fickian,
   anomalous or case II drug transport arises naturally from the model,
   which are characterized by quasi-power-law release profiles with
   exponents ranging from 0.5 to 1, respectively. A necessary requirement
   for non-Fickian release in our model is that the matrix stress
   relaxation time is comparable to the time scale for water diffusion.
   Mutual diffusivities and their composition dependence are the most
   decisive factors in controlling drug release characteristics in our
   model. Regression of the experimental polymer dissolution and drug
   release profiles in a system of Theophylline/cellulose (K15M)
   demonstrate that API-water mutual diffusivity in the presence of
   excipient cannot generally be taken as a constant. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study considers the problem of anti-windup (AW) controller design
   for singularly perturbed systems with actuator saturation. The AW
   controller consists of a dynamic state feedback (DSF) controller and an
   AW compensator. A convex optimisation problem in terms of linear matrix
   inequalities is formulated to simultaneously design both the DSF
   controller and the AW compensator. The resulting AW controller depends
   on the singular perturbation parameter e and is shown to be
   well-conditioned for any e of interest. Furthermore, a two-stage design
   method is proposed to handle the case that e is unknown. An
   e-independent DSF controller is designed at the first stage, and then an
   e-independent AW compensator is constructed by solving a convex
   optimisation problem. Both of the methods can achieve a desired
   stability bound and enlarge the basin of attraction at the same time.
   Finally, examples are given to show the advantages and effectiveness of
   the obtained results.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation behaviors of a zirconium alloy
   were in-situ studied by scanning electron microscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy. The zirconium alloy can absorb hydrogen to form Zr
   hydride which is enhanced by the relaxation of inner stress in the
   alloy. The hydrogen is generated from an ion/electron beam stimulated
   decomposition of an organometallic precursor, trimethyl
   (methylcyclopentadienyl) platinum (IV), in a scanning electron
   microscope and focused ion beam system. The formed delta-type zirconium
   hydride that has a face centered cubic structure was observed to grow as
   preferentially oriented platelets in the zirconium alloy matrix. The
   platelets have a common crystallographic relationship of
   {[}010](alpha)//{[}1-10](delta), (001)(alpha)//(111)(delta). The
   dehydrogenation of the zirconium hydride was in-situ investigated in a
   transmission electron microscope by heating the materials. It was found
   that the delta-ZrH1.5-1.66 hydride transformed into zeta-ZrH0.25 at 450
   degrees C even at a longer heating time. The experiment demonstrates a
   new way for in-situ study of hydrogenation behaviors of other hydrogen

Title = {{On the Skill of Balancing While Riding a Bicycle}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Humans have ridden bicycles for over 200 years, yet there are no
   continuous measures of how skill differs between novice and expert. To
   address this knowledge gap, we measured the dynamics of human bicycle
   riding in 14 subjects, half of whom were skilled and half were novice.
   Each subject rode an instrumented bicycle on training rollers at speeds
   ranging from 1 to 7 m/s. Steer angle and rate, steer torque, bicycle
   speed, and bicycle roll angle and rate were measured and steering power
   calculated. A force platform beneath the roller assembly measured the
   net force and moment that the bicycle, rider and rollers exerted on the
   floor, enabling calculations of the lateral positions of the system
   centers of mass and pressure. Balance performance was quantified by
   cross-correlating the lateral positions of the centers of mass and
   pressure. The results show that all riders exhibited similar balance
   performance at the slowest speed. However at higher speeds, the skilled
   riders achieved superior balance performance by employing more rider
   lean control (quantified by crosscorrelating rider lean angle and
   bicycle roll angle) and less steer control (quantified by
   cross-correlating steer rate and bicycle roll rate) than did novice
   riders. Skilled riders also used smaller steering control input with
   less variation (measured by average positive steering power and standard
   deviations of steer angle and rate) and less rider lean angle variation
   (measured by the standard deviation of the rider lean angle) independent
   of speed. We conclude that the reduction in balance control input by
   skilled riders is not due to reduced balance demands but rather to more
   effective use of lean control to guide the center of mass via center of
   pressure movements.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a systematic coarse-grained (CG) model for methylcellulose
   polymers, including random copolymers with compositions representative
   of modeling commercial METHOCEL A polymer, using one CG bead per
   monomer. We parametrize our CG model using the RDFs from atomistic
   simulations of short methylcellulose oligomers, extrapolating the
   results to long chains. Using a LJ 9-6 potential, the CG model captures
   the effect of monomer substitution type and temperature observed in
   detailed atomistic simulations. We use dissociation free energy to
   validate our CG model against the atomistic model. We then use this CG
   model to simulate single chains up to 1000 monomers long, and we
   calculate persistence lengths for a selection of homogeneous and
   heterogeneous methylcellulose chains, which show good agreement with
   experimental results. Interestingly, simulations of 600-mer
   heterogeneous chains show a collapse transition at 50 degrees C and form
   a stable ring structure with outer diameter around 14 nm. This structure
   appears to be a precursor to fibril structure reported in a recent study
   of methylcellulose gels {[}Biomacromolecules 2013, 14, 2484].}},

Abstract = {{We propose a simple and robust phase demodulation algorithm for two-shot
   fringe patterns with random phase shifts. Based on a smoothness
   assumption, the phase to be recovered is decomposed into a linear
   combination of finite terms of orthogonal polynomials, and the expansion
   coefficients and the phase shift are exhaustively searched through
   global optimization. The technique is insensitive to noise or defects,
   and is capable of retrieving phase from low fringe-number (less than
   one) or lowfrequency interferograms. It can also cope with
   interferograms with very small phase shifts. The retrieved phase is
   continuous and no further phase unwrapping process is required. The
   method is expected to be promising to process interferograms with
   regular fringes, which are common in optical shop testing. Computer
   simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the
   performance of the algorithm. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Wavefront reconstruction in radial shearing interferometry with general

   ill-conditioned. Here we propose a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method
   to cope with off-axis wavefront reconstruction with any aperture type.
   The proposed method constructs a set of orthogonal basis functions and
   computes the corresponding expansion coefficients, which are converted
   into another set of expansion coefficients to reproduce the original
   wavefront. The method can effectively alleviate the ill-conditioning of
   the problem, and is numerically stable compared with the classic
   least-squares method, especially for non-circular apertures and in the
   presence of noise. Computer simulation and experimental results are
   presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We report on the fabrication and characterization of single-crystal
   Gallium Nitride (GaN) membrane organic gas sensor. The sensing device is
   based on the highly stable free-standing III-nitride membrane, and it is
   probed using non-destructive impedance spectroscopy. Monitoring the
   effect of a series of polar organic molecules on the electrochemical
   impedance spectrum of the sensing membrane in the frequency range of 1
   mHz to 0.1 MHz at room temperature, we concluded that the sensor is
   highly sensitive to alcohols, in the gas phase, with selectivity that
   depends on the molecular weight and vapor pressure of the molecules. The
   highly robust and stable GaN crystalline membrane and the ability to
   test these sensors using impedance spectroscopy and electrochemical
   probing techniques suggest that single crystal GaN-based sensors can
   find a wide range of applications in harsh and extreme environments. (C)

Abstract = {{Stochastic image reconstruction has been applied to a dual-particle
   imaging system being designed for nuclear safeguards applications. The
   dual-particle imager (DPI) is a combined Compton-scatter and
   neutron-scatter camera capable of producing separate neutron and photon
   images. The stochastic origin ensembles (SOE) method was investigated as
   an imaging method for the DPI because only a minimal estimation of
   system response is required to produce images with quality that is
   comparable to common maximum-likelihood methods. This work contains
   neutron and photon SOE image reconstructions for a Cf-252 point source,
   two mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel canisters representing point sources, and the
   MOX fuel canisters representing a distributed source. Simulation of the
   DPI using MCNPX-PoliMi is validated by comparison of simulated and
   measured results. Because image quality is dependent on the number of
   counts and iterations used, the relationship between these quantities is
   investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present our results on the Chandra X-ray Observatory Advanced CCD
   Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observations of the bright Oort Cloud comets
   C/2012 S1 (ISON) and C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS). ISON was observed between
   2013 October 31-November 06 during variable speed solar wind (SW), and
   PanSTARRS was observed between 2013 April 17-23 during fast SW. ISON
   produced an extended parabolic X-ray morphology consistent with a
   collisionally thick coma, while PanSTARRS demonstrated only a diffuse
   X-ray-emitting region. We consider these emissions to be from charge
   exchange (CX) and model each comet's emission spectrum from first
   principles accordingly. Our model agrees with the observational spectra
   and also generates composition ratios for heavy, highly charged SW ions
   interacting with the cometary atmosphere. We compare our derived SW ion
   compositions to observational data and find a strong agreement between
   them. These results further demonstrate the utility of CX emissions as a
   remote diagnostics tool of both astrophysical plasma interaction and SW
   composition. In addition, we observe potential soft X-ray emissions via
   ACIS around 0.2 keV from both comets that are correlated in intensity to
   the hard X-ray emissions between 0.4-1.0 keV. We fit our CX model to
   these emissions, but our lack of a unique solution at low energies makes
   it impossible to conclude if they are cometary CX in origin. Finally, we
   discuss probable emission mechanism sources for the soft X-rays and
   explore new opportunities these findings present in understanding
   cometary emission processes via Chandra.}},

Title = {{ALTERED VESICULAR GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE MOUSE
   COCHLEAR NUCLEUS FOLLOWING COCHLEAR INSULT}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{315}},
Pages = {{114-124}},
Month = {{FEB 19}},
Abstract = {{Vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (VGLUT1 and VGLUT2) have
   distinct distributions in the cochlear nucleus that correspond to
   sources of the labeled terminals. VGLUT1 is mainly associated with
   terminals of auditory nerve fibers, whereas VGLUT2 is mainly associated
   with glutamatergic terminals deriving from other sources that project to
   the cochlear nucleus (CN), including somatosensory and vestibular
   terminals. Previous studies in guinea pig have shown that cochlear
   damage results in a decrease of VGLUT1-labeled puncta and an increase in
   VGLUT2-labeled puncta. This indicates cross-modal compensation that is
   of potential importance in somatic tinnitus. To examine whether this
   effect is consistent across species and to provide a background for
   future studies, using transgenesis, the current study examines VGLUT
   expression profiles upon cochlear insult by intracochlear kanamycin
   injections in the mouse. Intracochlear kanamycin injections abolished
   ipsilateral ABR responses in all animals and reduced ipsilateral spiral
   ganglion neuron densities in animals that were sacrificed after four
   weeks, but not in animals that were sacrificed after three weeks. In all
   unilaterally deafened animals, VGLUT1 density was decreased in CN
   regions that receive auditory nerve fiber terminals, i.e., in the deep
   layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), in the interstitial region
   where the auditory nerve enters the CN, and in the magnocellular region
   of the antero- and posteroventral CN. In contrast, density of VGLUT2
   expression was upregulated in the fusiform cell layer of the DCN and in
   the granule cell lamina, which are known to receive somatosensory and
   vestibular terminals. These results show that a cochlear insult induces
   cross-modal compensation in the cochlear nucleus of the mouse,
   confirming previous findings in guinea pig, and that these changes are
   not dependent on the occurrence of spiral ganglion neuron degeneration.

Abstract = {{The study presented in this paper introduces a new intelligent
   methodology to mitigate the vibration response of flexible cantilever
   plates. The use of the piezoelectric sensor/ actuator pairs for active
   control of plates is discussed. An intelligent neural network based
   controller is designed to control the optimal voltage applied on the
   piezoelectric patches. The control technique utilizes a neurocontroller
   along with a Kalman Filter to compute the appropriate actuator command.
   The neurocontroller is trained based on an algorithm that incorporates a
   set of emulator neural networks which are also trained to predict the
   future response of the cantilever plate. Then, the neurocontroller is
   evaluated by comparing the uncontrolled and controlled responses under
   several types of dynamic excitations. It is observed that the
   neurocontroller reduced the vibration response of the flexible
   cantilever plate significantly; the results demonstrated the success and
   robustness of the neurocontroller independent of the type and
   distribution of the excitation force. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Leveraging nonlinear saturation-based phenomena in an L-shaped vibration
   energy harvesting system}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},

Volume = {{363}},
Pages = {{517-531}},

Abstract = {{Trees exploit intriguing mechanisms such as multimodal frequency
   distributions and nonlinearities to distribute and dampen the
   aerodynamically-induced vibration energies to which they are subjected.
   In dynamical systems, these mechanisms are comparable to internal
   resonance phenomena. In recent years, researchers have harnessed strong
   nonlinearities, including internal resonance, to induce energetic
   dynamics that enhance performance of vibration energy harvesting
   systems. For trees, the internal resonance-like dynamics are evidently
   useful to dampen swaying motions in spite of the high variation
   associated with excitation and structural parameters. Yet for dynamic
   systems, studies show narrow operating regimes which exhibit internal
   resonance-based behaviors; this additionally suggests that the energetic
   dynamics may be susceptible to deactivation if stochastic inputs corrupt
   ideal excitation properties. To address these issues and to investigate
   whether the underlying motivation of exploiting internal
   resonance-induced saturation dynamics is truly justified, this research
   evaluates the opportunities enabled by exploiting nonlinear, multimodal
   motions in an L-shaped energy harvester platform. The system dynamics
   are probed analytically, numerically, and experimentally for
   comprehensive insights on the versatility of internal resonance-based
   behaviors for energy harvesting. It is found that although activating
   the high amplitude nonlinear dynamics to enhance power generation is
   robust to significant additive noise in the harmonic excitations,
   parameter sensitivities may pose practical challenges in application.
   Discussion is provided on means to address such concerns and on future
   strategies that may favorably exploit nonlinearity and multimodal
   dynamics for robust energy harvesting performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are frequently used for
   translational cancer research, and are assumed to behave consistently as
   the tumor ages. However, growth rate constancy as a function of time is
   unclear. Notably, variable PDX growth rates over time might have
   implications for the interpretation of translational studies. We
   characterized four PDX models through several in vivo passages from
   primary human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and salivary gland
   adenoid cystic carcinoma. We developed a mathematical approach to merge
   growth data from different passages into a single measure of relative
   tumor volume normalized to study initiation size. We analyzed
   log-relative tumor volume increase with linear mixed effect models. Two
   oral pathologists analyzed the PDX tissues to determine if
   histopathological feature changes occurred over in vivo passages. Tumor
   growth rate increased over time. This was determined by repeated
   measures linear regression statistical analysis in four different PDX
   models. A quadratic statistical model for the temporal effect predicted
   the log-relative tumor volume significantly better than a linear time
   effect model. We found a significant correlation between passage number
   and histopathological features of higher tumor grade. Our mathematical
   treatment of PDX data allows statistical analysis of tumor growth data
   over long periods of time, including over multiple passages. Non-linear
   tumor growth in our regression models revealed the exponential growth
   rate increased over time. The dynamic tumor growth rates correlated with
   quantifiable histopathological changes that related to passage number in
   multiple types of cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental, social and economic concerns motivate the operation of
   closed-loop supply chain networks (CLSCN) in many industries. We propose
   a novel profit maximization model for CLSCN design as a mixedinteger
   linear program in which there is flexibility in covering the proportions
   of demand satisfied and returns collected based on the firm's policies.
   Our major contribution is to develop a novel hybrid robust-stochastic
   programming (HRSP) approach to simultaneously model two different types
   of uncertainties by including stochastic scenarios for transportation
   costs and polyhedral uncertainty sets for demands and returns.
   Transportation cost scenarios are generated using a Latin Hypercube
   Sampling method and scenario reduction is applied to consolidate them.
   An accelerated stochastic Benders decomposition algorithm is proposed
   for solving this model. To speed up the convergence of this algorithm,
   valid inequalities are introduced to improve the lower bound quality,
   and also a Pareto-optimal cut generation scheme is used to strengthen
   the Benders optimality cuts. Numerical studies are performed to verify
   our mathematical formulation and also demonstrate the benefits of the
   HRSP approach. The performance improvements achieved by the valid
   inequalities and Pareto-optimal cuts are demonstrated in randomly
   generated instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo assess the impact of simulation training on complications
   associated with femoral arterial access obtained by first year
   cardiology fellows. Background: Prior studies demonstrate a higher
   incidence of arterial access related complications among patients
   undergoing invasive cardiac procedures.
   MethodsFirst year cardiology fellows at four teaching hospitals in
   Michigan tracked their femoral access experience and any associated
   complications between July 2011 and June 2013. Fellows starting their
   academic training in July 2012 were first trained on a specially
   developed simulator before starting their rotation in the
   catheterization laboratory. The primary outcome was access proficiency,
   defined as five successful femoral access attempts without any
   complication or need to seek help from a more experienced team member.
   ResultsA total of 1,278 femoral access attempts were made by 21 fellows
   in 2011-2012 compared with 869 femoral access attempts made by 21
   fellows in 2012-2013. There was a lower rate of access related
   complications in patients undergoing access attempts by first year
   fellows in year 2 compared with year 1 (2.1\% versus 4.5\%, P=0.003) .
   The number of procedures to achieve procedural proficiency was
   significantly higher in year 1 compared with year 2 (median 20 versus
   10, P=0.007).
   ConclusionsIncorporation of simulation in the training of first year
   fellows was associated with an improvement in proficiency and a
   clinically meaningful reduction in vascular complications. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Two types of agglomerates powder with grain sizes in the submicron-
   /nano-range were used as the feedstock to deposit yttria partially
   stabilized zirconia (YPSZ) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). The dual
   modal submicron-coating and multi-modal nano-coating were fabricated.
   The results from thermal shock test indicated that, due to the weak bond
   and higher densification rate of unmelted nano-particles in the
   nano-coating, the interface between recrystallization zone and unmelted
   nano-particles linked up, which resulted in the decrease of content of
   unmelted nano-particles from 13\% to 7\%. The weak bond and higher
   shrinking rate of nano-particles led to the formation of coarse cracks
   that ran along the recrystallization zone/unmelted nano-particles
   interfaces. These cracks caused the premature failure of nano-coating.
   The submicron-coating can overcome the inherent deficiencies of
   nano-coating at high temperatures and show a higher thermal shock
   resistance, it is expected to become a candidate for high-performance
   TBCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the desmosome protein family are integral components of the
   cardiac area composita, a mixed junctional complex responsible for
   electromechanical coupling between cardiomyocytes. In this study, we
   provide evidence that loss of the desmosomal armadillo protein
   Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) in cardiomyocytes elevates transforming growth
   factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
   (MAPK) signaling, which together coordinate a transcriptional program
   that results in increased expression of profibrotic genes. Importantly,
   we demonstrate that expression of Desmoplakin (DP) is lost upon PKP2
   knockdown and that restoration of DP expression rescues the activation
   of this TGF-beta 1/p38 MAPK transcriptional cascade. Tissues from PKP2
   heterozygous and DP conditional knockout mouse models also exhibit
   elevated TGF-beta 1/p38 MAPK signaling and induction of fibrotic gene
   expression in vivo. These data therefore identify PKP2 and DP as central
   players in coordination of desmosome-dependent TGF-beta 1/p38 MAPK
   signaling in cardiomyocytes, pathways known to play a role in different
   types of cardiac disease, such as arrhythmogenic or hypertrophic
   cardiomyopathy.}},

Abstract = {{A new time-dependent Method of Characteristics (MOC) formulation for
   nuclear reactor kinetics was developed utilizing angular flux
   time-derivative propagation. This method avoids the requirement of
   storing the angular flux at previous points in time to represent a
   discretized time derivative; instead, an equation for the angular flux
   time derivative along 1D spatial characteristics is derived and solved
   concurrently with the 1D transport characteristic equation. This
   approach allows the angular flux time derivative to be recast
   principally in terms of the neutron source time derivatives, which are
   approximated to high-order accuracy using the backward differentiation
   formula (BDF). This approach, called Source Derivative Propagation
   (SDP), drastically reduces the memory requirements of time-dependent MOC
   relative to methods that require storing the angular flux. An SDP method
   was developed for 2D and 3D applications and implemented in the computer
   code DeCART in 2D. DeCART was used to model two reactor transient
   benchmarks: a modified TWIGL problem and a C5G7 transient. The SDP
   method accurately and efficiently replicated the solution of the
   conventional time-dependent MOC method using two orders of magnitude
   less memory. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we construct active flux schemes for advection diffusion.
   Active flux schemes are efficient third order finite-volume-type schemes
   developed thus far for hyperbolic systems. This paper extends the active
   flux schemes to advection diffusion problems based on a first-order
   hyperbolic system formulation that is equivalent to the advection
   diffusion equation in pseudo-steady state. An active flux scheme is
   first developed for a generic hyperbolic system with source terms,
   applied then to a hyperbolized diffusion system, extended to advection
   diffusion by incorporating the advective term as a source term, and
   enabled for unsteady problems by implicit time integration. Boundary
   conditions are discussed in relation to a non-uniqueness issue, and a
   weak boundary condition is shown to resolve the issue. Both for steady
   problems and for sub iterations within unsteady problems, a globally
   coupled system of residual equations is solved by Newton's method.
   Numerical results show that third-order accuracy is obtained in both the
   solution and the gradient on irregular grids with rapid convergence of
   Newton's method, i.e., four or five residual evaluations are sufficient
   to obtain the design accuracy in both space and time. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Fumed silica is produced in 1000 tons per year quantities by combusting
   SiCl4 in H-2/O-2 flames. Given that both SiCl4 and combustion byproduct
   HCl are corrosive, toxic and polluting, this route to fumed silica
   requires extensive safeguards that may be obviated if an alternate route
   were found. Silica, including rice hull ash (RHA) can be directly
   depolymerized using hindered diols to generate distillable spirocyclic
   alkoxysilanes or Si(OEt)(4). We report here the use of liquid-feed flame
   spray pyrolysis (LF-FSP) to combust the aforementioned precursors to
   produce fumed silica very similar to SiCl4-derived products. The
   resulting powders are amorphous, necked, <50nm average particle sizes,
   with specific surface areas (SSAs) of 140-230m(2)g(-1). The LF-FSP
   approach does not require the containment constraints of the SiCl4
   process and given that the RHA silica source is produced in million ton
   per year quantities worldwide, the reported approach represents a
   sustainable, green and potentially lower-cost alternative.}},

Volume = {{177}},

Abstract = {{We propose and develop SG-ELM, a stable online learning algorithm based
   on stochastic gradients and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). We propose
   SG-ELM particularly for systems that are required to be stable during
   learning; i.e., the estimated model parameters remain bounded during
   learning. We use a Lyapunov approach to prove both asymptotic stability
   of estimation error and boundedness in the model parameters suitable for
   identification of nonlinear dynamic systems. Using the Lyapunov
   approach, we determine an upper bound for the learning rate of SG-ELM.
   The SG-ELM algorithm not only guarantees a stable learning but also
   reduces the computational demand compared to the recursive least squares
   based OS-ELM algorithm (Liang et al., 2006). In order to demonstrate the
   working of SG-ELM on a real world problem, an advanced combustion engine
   identification is considered. The algorithm is applied to two case
   studies: An online regression learning for system identification of a
   Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) Engine and an online
   classification learning (with class imbalance) for identifying the
   dynamic operating envelope. The case studies demonstrate that the
   accuracy of the proposed SG-ELM is comparable to that of the OS-ELM
   approach but adds stability and a reduction in computational effort. (C)

Title = {{Out-coupling of Longitudinal Photoacoustic Pulses by Mitigating the
   Phase Cancellation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Waves of any kinds, including sound waves and light waves, can interfere
   constructively or destructively when they are overlapped, allowing for
   myriad applications. However, unlike continuous waves of a single
   frequency, interference of photoacoustic pulses is often overlooked
   because of their broadband characteristics and short pulse durations.
   Here, we study cancellation of two symmetric photoacoustic pulses
   radiated in the opposite direction from the same photoacoustic sources
   near a free surface. The cancellation occurs when one of the two pulses
   is reflected with polarity reversal from the free surface and catches up
   with the other. The cancellation effect, responsible for reduced signal
   amplitudes, is systematically examined by implementing a thin
   transparent matching medium of the same acoustic impedance. By changing
   the thickness of the transparent layer, the overlap of the two symmetric
   pulses is controlled. For optimized matching layers, the cancellation
   effect can be significantly reduced, while the resulting output waveform
   remains unchanged. Similar to the planar absorber, different dimensional
   absorbers including cylinders and spheres also exhibit the cancellation
   between the outward and inward waves. This work could provide further
   understanding of photoacoustic generation and a simple strategy for
   increasing photoacoustic signal amplitudes.}},

Title = {{Protecting the properties of monolayer MoS2 on silicon based substrates
   with an atomically thin buffer}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Semiconducting 2D materials, like transition metal dichalcogenides
   (TMDs), have gained much attention for their potential in
   opto-electronic devices, valleytronic schemes, and semi-conducting to
   metallic phase engineering. However, like graphene and other atomically
   thin materials, they lose key properties when placed on a substrate like
   silicon, including quenching of photoluminescence, distorted crystalline
   structure, and rough surface morphology. The ability to protect these
   properties of monolayer TMDs, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), on
   standard Si-based substrates, will enable their use in opto-electronic
   devices and scientific investigations. Here we show that an atomically
   thin buffer layer of hexagonal-boron nitride (hBN) protects the range of
   key opto-electronic, structural, and morphological properties of
   monolayer MoS2 on Si-based substrates. The hBN buffer restores sharp
   diffraction patterns, improves monolayer flatness by nearly two-orders
   of magnitude, and causes over an order of magnitude enhancement in
   photoluminescence, compared to bare Si and SiO2 substrates. Our
   demonstration provides a way of integrating MoS2 and other 2D monolayers
   onto standard Sisubstrates, thus furthering their technological
   applications and scientific investigations.}},

   via prepolymerizing dopamine on silicon particle surface and then

   and hydroxyl, while the elastic polymer layer reacts with PAA binder to
   form three-dimensional cross-linked binding system. The Si@PD/PAA
   electrode exhibits more stable cycle performance than conventional
   electrodes. In the case of thick electrode, a capacity of 3.69 mA h

Abstract = {{Biodegradable elastomeric biomaterials have attracted much attention in
   tissue engineering due to their biomimetic viscoelastic behavior and
   biocothpatibility. However, the low mechanical stability at hydrated
   state, fast biodegradation in vivo, and poor osteogenic activity greatly
   limited bioelastomers applications in bone tissue regeneration. Herein,
   we develop a series of poly(octanediol citrate) polyhedral oligomeric
   silsesquioxanes (POC-POSS) hybrids with highly tunable elastomeric
   behavior (hydrated state) and biodegradation and osteoblasts
   biocompatibility through a facile one-pot thermal polymerization
   strategy. POC POSS hybrids show significantly improved stiffness and
   ductility in either dry or hydrated conditions, as well as good
   antibiodegradation ability (20-50\% weight loss in 3 months). POC POSS
   hybrids exhibit significantly enhanced osteogenic differentiation
   through upregulating alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium
   deposition, and expression of osteogenic markers (ALPL, BGLAP, and
   Runx2). The high mechanical stability at hydrated state and enhanced
   osteogenic activity make POC POSS hybrid elastorriers promising as
   scaffolds and nanoscale vehicles for bone tissue regeneration and drug
   delivery. This study may also provide a new strategy (controlling the
   stiffness under hydrated condition) to design advanced hybrid
   biomaterials with high mechanical properties under physiological
   Condition for tissue regeneration applications.}},

Abstract = {{The desorption performances of naphthalene and pyrene on mesoporous
   MCM-41, SBA-15, and CMK-3 sorbents are studied on the basis of
   temperature-programmed desorption experiments over the temperature range
   of 350-800 K at different heating rates. The kinetic parameters for each
   sorbate sorbent pair are determined with combined model-fitting methods.
   The data for naphthalene and pyrene are best fitted with the same
   kinetic models on MCM-41 (with 1D mesopore channels), in contrast to
   those on SBA-15 and CMK-3, which have micropore mesopore structures,
   leading to different desorption mechanisms for these two sorbates.
   SBA-15 with interconnectivity between adjacent mesopores not only shows
   high sorption capacities but also offers diffusion advantages in
   desorption, which contributes to the order of the degree of ease in
   desorption: SBA-15 > MCM-41 > CMK-3. CMK-3, with higher microporosity
   and hydrophobicity, shows stronger binding with the adsorbates while
   still benefiting in pyrene desorption from the consecutive mesoporosity.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Pages = {{2068-2073}},

Abstract = {{Tinnitus, the perception of phantom sounds, is thought to arise from
   increased neural synchrony, which facilitates perceptual binding and
   creates salient sensory features in the absence of physical stimuli. In
   the auditory cortex, increased spontaneous cross-unit synchrony and
   single-unit bursting are de facto physiological correlates of tinnitus.
   However, it is unknown whether neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus
   (DCN), the putative tinnitus-induction site, exhibit increased
   synchrony. Using a temporary-threshold shift model and gap-prepulse
   inhibition of the acoustic startle to assess tinnitus, we recorded
   spontaneous activity from fusiform cells, the principle neurons of the
   DCN, in normal hearing, tinnitus, and non-tinnitus guinea pigs.
   Synchrony and bursting, as well as spontaneous firing rate (SFR),
   correlated with behavioral evidence of tinnitus, and increased synchrony
   and bursting were associated with SFR elevation. The presence of
   increased synchrony and bursting in DCN fusiform cells suggests that a
   neural code for phantom sounds emerges in this brainstem location and
   likely contributes to the formation of the tinnitus percept.}},

Abstract = {{Dense particle packing in a confining volume remains a rich, largely
   unexplored problem, despite applications in blood clotting, plasmonics,
   industrial packaging and transport, colloidal molecule design, and
   information storage. Here, we report densest found clusters of the
   Platonic solids in spherical confinement, for up to N = 60 constituent
   polyhedral particles. We examine the interplay between anisotropic
   particle shape and isotropic 3D confinement. Densest clusters exhibit a
   wide variety of symmetry point groups and form in up to three layers at
   higher N. For many N values, icosahedra and dodecahedra formclusters
   that resemble sphere clusters. These common structures are layers of
   optimal spherical codes in most cases, a surprising fact given the
   significant faceting of the icosahedron and dodecahedron. We also
   investigate cluster density as a function of N for each particle shape.
   We find that, in contrast to what happens in bulk, polyhedra often pack
   less densely than spheres. We also find especially dense clusters at
   so-called magic numbers of constituent particles. Our results showcase
   the structural diversity and experimental utility of families of
   solutions to the packing in confinement problem.}},

   1/tau(e), dominated by electron-acoustic phonon scattering, we reproduce

Abstract = {{Composite nanostructures consisting of porous NiO nanosheets on carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) are fabricated using a facile and low-cost electroless
   plating method. The CNTs, modified by a polymer, are adopted as the
   template upon which porous Ni nanosheets are grown using electroless
   plating. This is followed by removal of the polymer layer and oxidation
   of the Ni by controlled thermal annealing. The effect of reductant
   concentration on the morphology of the NiO nanosheets is studied. The
   electrochemical characteristics of the nanostructures are measured using
   chronopotentiometry. Experimental measurements show that the NiO
   nanosheet covered CNT composite nanostructures exhibit a relatively high
   specific capacitance of 1177 F g(-1) at a discharge current density of 2
   A g(-1), while retaining 89.2\% of its initial capacitance at a current
   density of 2 A g(-1) after 1000 cycles.}},

Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{The RDX single crystals are ignited by ultraviolet laser (355 nm, 6.4
   ns) pulses. The laser-induced damage morphology consisted of two
   distinct regions: a core region of layered fracture and a peripheral
   region of stripped material surrounding the core. As laser fluence
   increases, the area of the whole crack region increases all the way,
   while both the area and depth of the core region increase firstly, and
   then stay stable over the laser fluence of 12 J/cm(2). The experimental
   details indicate the dynamics during laser ignition process. Plasma
   fireball of high temperature and pressure occurs firstly, followed by
   the micro-explosions on the (210) surface, and finally shock waves
   propagate through the materials to further strip materials outside and
   yield in-depth cracks in larger surrounding region. The plasma fireball
   evolves from isotropic to anisotropic under higher laser fluence
   resulting in the damage expansion only in lateral direction while
   maintaining the fixed depth. The primary insights into the interaction
   dynamics between laser and energetic materials can help developing the
   superior laser ignition technique.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable polymer biomaterials with intrinsical photoluminescent
   properties have attracted much interest, due to their potential
   advantages for tissue regeneration and noninvasive bioimaging. However,
   few of current biodegradable polymers possess tunable intrinsically
   fluorescent properties, such as high photostability, fluorescent
   lifetime, and quantum field, and strong mechanical properties for
   meeting the requirements of biomedical applications. Here, by a facile
   one-step thermal polymerization, elastomeric poly(silicone-citrate)
   (PSC) hybrid polymers are developed with controlled biodegradability and
   mechanical properties, tunable inherent fluorescent emission (up to 600
   nm), high photostability (beyond 180 min for UV and six months for
   natural light), fluorescent lifetime (near 10 ns) and quantum yield
   (16\%-35\%), high cellular biocompatibility, and minimal inflammatory
   response in vivo, which provide advantages over conventional fluorescent
   dyes, quantum dots, and current fluorescent polymers. The promising
   applications of PSC hybrids for cell and implants imaging in vitro and
   in vivo are successfully demonstrated. The development of elastomeric
   PSC polymer may provide a new strategy in synthesizing new
   inorganic-organic hybrid photoluminescent materials for tissue
   regeneration and bioimaging applications.}},

Abstract = {{The splitting of water photoelectrochemically into hydrogen and oxygen
   represents a promising technology for converting solar energy to
   fuel(1,2). The main challenge is to ensure that photogenerated holes
   efficiently oxidize water, which generally requires modification of the
   photoanode with an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) to increase the
   photocurrent and reduce the onset potential(3). However, because excess
   OEC material can hinder light absorption and decrease photoanode
   performance(4), its deposition needs to be carefully controlled-yet it
   is unclear which semiconductor surface sites give optimal improvement if
   targeted for OEC deposition, and whether sites catalysing water
   oxidation also contribute to competing charge-carrier recombination with
   photogenerated electrons(5). Surface heterogeneity(6) exacerbates these
   uncertainties, especially for nanostructured photoanodes benefiting from
   small charge-carrier transport distances(1,7,8). Here we use
   super-resolution imaging(9-13), operated in a charge-carrier-selective
   manner and with a spatiotemporal resolution of approximately 30
   nanometres and 15 milliseconds, to map both the electron-and hole-driven
   photoelectrocatalytic activities on single titanium oxide nanorods. We
   then map, with sub-particle resolution (about 390 nanometres), the
   photocurrent associated with water oxidation, and find that the most
   active sites for water oxidation are also the most important sites for
   charge-carrier recombination. Site-selective deposition of an OEC,
   guided by the activity maps, improves the overall performance of a given
   nanorod-even though more improvement in photocurrent efficiency
   correlates with less reduction in onset potential (and vice versa) at
   the sub-particle level. Moreover, the optimal catalyst deposition sites
   for photocurrent enhancement are the lower-activity sites, and for onset
   potential reduction the optimal sites are the sites with more positive
   onset potential, contrary to what is obtainable under typical deposition
   conditions. These findings allow us to suggest an activity-based
   strategy for rationally engineering catalyst-improved photoelectrodes,
   which should be widely applicable because our measurements can be
   performed for many different semiconductor and catalyst materials.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional gold standard histopathologic diagnosis requires
   information of both high resolution structural and chemical changes in
   tissue. Providing optical information at ultrasonic resolution,
   photoacoustic (PA) technique could provide highly sensitive and highly
   accurate tissue characterization noninvasively in the authentic in vivo
   environment, offering a replacement for histopathology. A
   two-dimensional (2D) physio-chemical spectrogram (PCS) combining
   micrometer to centimeter morphology and chemical composition
   simultaneously can be generated for each biological sample with PA
   measurements at multiple optical wavelengths. This spectrogram presents
   a unique 2D ``physio-chemical signature{''} for any specific type of
   tissue. Comprehensive analysis of PCS, termed PA physio-chemical
   analysis (PAPCA), can lead to very rich diagnostic information,
   including the contents of all relevant molecular and chemical components
   along with their corresponding histological microfeatures, comparable to
   those accessible by conventional histology. PAPCA could contribute to
   the diagnosis of many diseases involving diffusive patterns such as

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1330-1337}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{To develop industry-specific policies for mitigating environmental
   pressures, previous studies primarily focus on identifying sectors that
   directly generate large amounts of environmental pressures (a.k.a.
   production-based method) or indirectly drive large amounts of
   environmental pressures through supply chains (e.g., consumption-based
   method). In addition to those sectors as important environmental
   pressure producers or drivers, there exist sectors that are also
   important to environmental pressure mitigation as transmission centers.
   Economy-wide environmental pressure mitigation might be achieved by
   improving production efficiency of these key transmission sectors, that
   is, using less upstream inputs to produce unitary output. We develop a
   betweenness-based method to measure the importance of transmission
   sectors, borrowing the betweenness concept from network analysis. We
   quantify the betweenness of sectors by examining supply chain paths
   extracted from structural path analysis that pass through a particular
   sector. We take China as an example and find that those critical
   transmission sectors identified by betweenness-based method are not
   always identifiable by existing methods. This indicates that
   betweenness-based method can provide additional insights that cannot be
   obtained with existing methods on the roles individual sectors play in
   generating economy-wide environmental pressures. Betweenness-based
   method proposed here can therefore complement existing methods for
   guiding sector-level environmental pressure mitigation strategies.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1403-1411}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{The reactivity of disordered, noncrystalline U(IV) species remains
   poorly characterized despite their prevalence in biostimulated
   sediments. Because of the lack of crystalline structure, noncrystalline
   U(IV) may be susceptible to oxidative mobilization under oxic
   conditions. The present study investigated the mechanism and rate of
   oxidation of biogenic noncrystalline U(IV) by dissolved oxygen (DO) in
   the presence of mackinawite (FeS). Previously recognized as an effective
   reductant and oxygen scavenger, nanoparticulate FeS was evaluated for
   its role in influencing U release in a flow through system as a function
   of pH and carbonate concentration. The results demonstrated that
   noncrystalline U(IV) was more susceptible to oxidation than uraninite
   (UO2) in the presence of dissolved carbonate. A rapid release of U
   occurred immediately after FeS addition without exhibiting a temporary
   inhibition stage, as was observed during the oxidation of UO2, although
   FeS still kept DO levels low. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   characterized a transient surface Fe(III) species during the initial FeS
   oxidation, which was likely responsible for oxidizing noncrystalline
   U(IV) in addition to oxygen. In the absence of carbonate, however, the
   release of dissolved U was significantly hindered as a result of U
   adsorption by FeS oxidation products. This study illustrates the strong
   interactions between iron sulfide and U(IV) species during redox
   transformation and implies the lability of biogenic noncrystalline U(IV)
   species in the subsurface environment when subjected to redox cycling
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral matching, the process of modifying a seed acceleration time

   factor affecting the changes in ground motion characteristics. The
   technique used for modification (e.g., time domain or frequency domain)
   is in many cases not critical. Based on the results, recommendations in

Abstract = {{Striatal projection neurons form a sparsely-connected inhibitory
   network, and this arrangement may be essential for the appropriate
   temporal organization of behavior. Here we show that a simplified,
   sparse inhibitory network of Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons can
   reproduce some key features of striatal population activity, as observed
   in brain slices. In particular we develop a new metric to determine the
   conditions under which sparse inhibitory networks form anti-correlated
   cell assemblies with time-varying activity of individual cells. We find
   that under these conditions the network displays an input-specific
   sequence of cell assembly switching, that effectively discriminates
   similar inputs. Our results support the proposal that GABAergic
   connections between striatal projection neurons allow
   stimulus-selective, temporally-extended sequential activation of cell
   assemblies. Furthermore, we help to show how altered intrastriatal
   GABAergic signaling may produce aberrant network-level information
   processing in disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The second leading cause of death in the United States, cancer is at its
   most dangerous as it spreads to secondary locations. Cancer cells in the
   blood stream, or circulating tumor cells (CTCs), present an opportunity
   to study metastasis provided they may be extracted successfully from
   blood. Engineers have accelerated the development of technologies that
   achieve this goal based on exploiting differences between tumor cells
   and surrounding blood cells such as varying expression patterns of
   membrane proteins or physical characteristics. Collaboration with
   biologists and clinicians has allowed additional analysis and will lead
   to the use of these rare cells to their full potential in the fight
   against cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Over the years, one major objective of IIW Joint Working Group (JWG) on
   residual stresses and distortion prediction (RSDP) has been the
   development of consistent residual stress profiles for supporting
   fitness-for-service assessment of welded components. As a result of the
   JWG activities and further in-depth investigations, this paper presents
   a major development on a novel full-field residual stress estimation
   scheme that can be used for describing through-thickness residual stress
   profiles not only within a weld region, but also at any location away
   from a weld in pressure vessel and piping components. Within weld
   region, a systematic parametric finite element analysis is used to
   establish key parameters that govern through-thickness residual stress
   distribution characteristics by introducing membrane, bending, and
   self-equilibrating based decomposition technique. Away from weld region,
   a shell theory based method is developed for describing
   through-thickness residual stress distribution at any distance away from
   weld toe. This paper presents detailed results for single ``V{''} joint
   preparation with pipe wall thickness varying from 6.25 to 250 mm and
   wall thickness to pipe radius ratio (r/t) varying from 2 to 100. The
   residual stress estimation method can be applied for double V and narrow
   groove joint preparations for girth welded components since all three
   joint preparations have been shown to follow a similar functional form
   to that seen in single V joint preparation.}},

Abstract = {{Sequential estimation of a vector of linear-regression coefficients is
   considered under both centralized and decentralized setups. In
   sequential estimation, the number of observations used for estimation is
   determined by the observed samples and hence is random, as opposed to
   fixed-sample-size estimation. Specifically, after receiving a new
   sample, if a target accuracy level is reached, we stop and estimate
   using the samples collected so far; otherwise we continue to receive
   another sample. It is known that finding an optimum sequential
   estimator, which minimizes the average observation number for a given
   target accuracy level, is an intractable problem with a general stopping
   rule that depends on the complete observation history. By properly
   restricting the search space to stopping rules that depend on a specific
   subset of the complete observation history, we derive the optimum
   sequential estimator in the centralized case via optimal stopping
   theory. However, finding the optimum stopping rule in this case requires
   numerical computations that quadratically scale with the number of
   parameters to be estimated. For the decentralized setup with stringent
   energy constraints, under an alternative problem formulation that is
   conditional on the observed regressors, we first derive a simple optimum
   scheme with a well-defined one-dimensional stopping rule regardless of
   the number of parameters. Then, following this simple optimum scheme, we
   propose a decentralized sequential estimator whose computational
   complexity and energy consumption scale linearly with the number of
   parameters. Specifically, in the proposed decentralized scheme a
   close-to-optimum average stopping-time performance is achieved by
   infrequently transmitting a single pulse with very short duration.}},

Title = {{DELTACON: Principled Massive-Graph Similarity Function with Attribution}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{How much has a network changed since yesterday? How different is the
   wiring of Bob's brain (a left-handed male) and Alice's brain (a
   right-handed female), and how is it different? Graph similarity with
   given node correspondence, i.e., the detection of changes in the
   connectivity of graphs, arises in numerous settings. In this work, we
   formally state the axioms and desired properties of the graph similarity
   functions, and evaluate when state-of-the-art methods fail to detect
   crucial connectivity changes in graphs. We propose DELTACON, a
   principled, intuitive, and scalable algorithm that assesses the
   similarity between two graphs on the same nodes (e.g., employees of a
   company, customers of a mobile carrier). In conjunction, we propose
   DELTACON-ATTR, a related approach that enables attribution of change or
   dissimilarity to responsible nodes and edges. Experiments on various
   synthetic and real graphs showcase the advantages of our method over
   existing similarity measures. Finally, we employ DELTACON and
   DELTACON-ATTR on real applications: (a) we classify people to groups of
   high and low creativity based on their brain connectivity graphs, (b) do
   temporal anomaly detection in the who-emails-whom Enron graph and find
   the top culprits for the changes in the temporal corporate email graph,
   and (c) recover pairs of test-retest large brain scans (similar to 17M
   edges, up to 90M edges) for 21 subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Particle-based kinetic simulations of steady and unsteady hydrazine
   chemical rocket plumes are presented in a study of plume interactions
   with the ambient magnetosphere in geostationary Earth orbit. The
   hydrazine chemical rocket plume expands into a near-vacuum plasma
   environment, requiring the use of a combined direct simulation Monte
   Carlo/particle-in-cell methodology for the rarefied plasma conditions.
   Detailed total and differential cross sections are employed to
   characterize the charge exchange reactions between the neutral hydrazine
   plume mixture and the ambient hydrogen ions, and ion production is also
   modeled for photoionization processes. These ionization processes lead
   to an increase in local plasma density surrounding the spacecraft owing
   to a partial ionization of the relatively high-density hydrazine plume.
   Results from the steady plume simulations indicate that the formation of
   the hydrazine ion plume are driven by several competing mechanisms,
   including (1) local depletion and (2) replenishing of ambient H+ ions by
   charge exchange and thermal motion of 1 keV H+ from the ambient
   reservoir, respectively, and (3) photoionization processes. The
   self-consistent electrostatic field forces and the geostationary
   magnetic field have only a small influence on the dynamics of the ion
   plume. The unsteady plume simulations show a variation in neutral and
   ion plume dissipation times consistent with the variation in relative
   diffusion rates of the chemical species, with full H-2 dissipation
   (below the ambient number density levels) approximately 33s after a 2s
   thruster burn.

Abstract = {{Spacecraft measurements reveal perplexing dawn-dusk asymmetries of field
   and plasma properties in the magnetospheres of Saturn and Jupiter. Here
   we describe a previously unrecognized source of dawn-dusk asymmetry in a
   rapidly rotating magnetosphere. We analyze two magnetohydrodynamic
   simulations, focusing on how flows along and across the field vary with
   local time in Saturn's dayside magnetosphere. As plasma rotates from
   dawn to noon on a dipolarizing flux tube, it flows away from the equator
   along the flux tube at roughly half of the sound speed (C-s), the
   maximum speed at which a bulk plasma can flow along a flux tube into a
   lower pressure region. As plasma rotates from noon to dusk on a
   stretching flux tube, the field-aligned component of its centripetal
   acceleration decreases and it flows back toward the equator at speeds
   typically smaller than 1/2Cs. Correspondingly, the plasma sheet remains
   far thicker and the field less stretched in the afternoon than in the
   morning. Different radial force balance in the morning and afternoon
   sectors produce asymmetry in the plasma sheet thickness and a net
   dusk-to-dawn flow inside of L=15 or equivalently, a large-scale electric
   field (E) oriented from postnoon to premidnight, as reported from
   observations. Morning-afternoon asymmetry analogous to that found at
   Saturn has been observed at Jupiter, and a noon-midnight component of E
   cannot be ruled out.

Abstract = {{Poynting flux into the ionosphere measures the electromagnetic energy
   coming from the magnetosphere. This energy flux can vary greatly between
   quiet times and geomagnetic active times. As part of the Geospace
   Environment Modeling-coupling energetics and dynamics of atmospheric
   regions modeling challenge, physics-based models of the 3-D ionosphere
   and ionospheric electrodynamics solvers of magnetosphere models that
   specify Joule heat and empirical models specifying Poynting flux were
   run for six geomagnetic storm events of varying intensity. We compared
   model results with Poynting flux values along the DMSP-15 satellite
   track computed from ion drift meter and magnetic field observations.
   Although being a different quantity, Joule heat can in practice be
   correlated to incoming Poynting flux because the energy is dissipated
   primarily in high latitudes where Poynting flux is being deposited.
   Within the physics-based model group, we find mixed results with some
   models overestimating Joule heat and some models agreeing better with
   observed Poynting flux rates as integrated over auroral passes. In
   contrast, empirical models tend to underestimate integrated Poynting
   flux values. Modeled Joule heat or Poynting flux patterns often resemble
   the observed Poynting flux patterns on a large scale, but amplitudes can
   differ by a factor of 2 or larger due to the highly localized nature of
   observed Poynting flux deposition that is not captured by the models. In
   addition, the positioning of modeled patterns appear to be randomly
   shifted against the observed Poynting flux energy input. This study is
   the first to compare Poynting flux and Joule heat in a large variety of
   models of the ionosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Using the Helium Oxygen Proton Electron (HOPE) and Electric Field and
   Waves (EFW) instruments from the Van Allen Probes, we explored the
   relationship between electron energy fluxes in the eV and keV ranges and
   spacecraft surface charging. We present statistical results on
   spacecraft charging within geosynchronous orbit by L and MLT. An
   algorithm to extract the H+ charging line in the HOPE instrument data
   was developed to better explore intense charging events. Also, this
   study explored how spacecraft potential relates to electron number
   density, electron pressure, electron temperature, thermal electron
   current, and low-energy ion density between 1 and 210eV. It is
   demonstrated that it is imperative to use both EFW potential
   measurements and the HOPE instrument ion charging line for examining
   times of extreme spacecraft charging of the Van Allen Probes. The
   results of this study show that elevated electron energy fluxes and
   high-electron pressures are present during times of spacecraft charging
   but these same conditions may also occur during noncharging times. We
   also show noneclipse significant negative charging events on the Van
   Allen Probes.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{318-331}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) involves distributing
   identical items from a depot to a set of demand locations using a single
   capacitated vehicle. We introduce the heterogeneous capacitated vehicle
   routing problem, a generalization of CVRP to the setting of multiple
   vehicles having nonuniform speeds, and present for it a constant-factor
   approximation algorithm.
   Our main contribution is an approximation algorithm for the
   heterogeneous traveling salesman problem, which is the special case of
   heterogeneous CVRP with uncapacitated vehicles. Given a metric denoting
   distances between vertices, a depot r containing k vehicles having
   respective speeds \{lambda(i)\}(i=1)(k), the objective in heterogeneous
   TSP is to find a tour for each vehicle (starting and ending at r) so
   that every vertex is covered in some tour and the maximum completion
   time is minimized; the completion time of a vehicle is the distance
   traveled divided by its speed.
   Our algorithm relies on a new approximate minimum spanning tree
   construction called Level-Prim, which is related to but different from
   Light Approximate Shortest-path Trees. We also extend the widely used
   tour-splitting technique to nonuniform speeds, using ideas from the
   2-approximation algorithm for scheduling in unrelated machines.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Polymerization reactions are commonly effected by exposing monomer
   formulations to some initiation stimulus such as elevated temperature,
   light, or a chemical reactant. Increasingly, these polymerization
   reactions are mediated by enzymes?catalytic proteins?owing to their
   reaction efficiency under mild conditions as well as their environmental
   friendliness. The utilization of enzymes, particularly oxidases and
   peroxidases, for generating radicals via reduction-oxidation mechanisms
   is especially common for initiating radical-mediated polymerization
   reactions, including vinyl chain-growth polymerization, atom transfer
   radical polymerization, thiol-ene step-growth polymerization, and
   polymerization via oxidative coupling. While enzyme-mediated
   polymerization is useful for the production of materials intended for
   subsequent use, it is especially well-suited for in situ
   polymerizations, where the polymer is formed in the place where it will
   be utilized. Such polymerizations are especially useful for biomedical
   adhesives and for sensing applications.}},

Abstract = {{Tensile properties on ASTM A216 WCB cast steel with centerline porosity
   defect were studied with radiographic mapping and finite element
   remodeling technique. Non-linear elastic and plastic behaviors dependent
   on porosity were mathematically described by relevant equation sets.
   According to the ASTM E8 tensile test standard, matrix and defect
   specimens were machined into two categories by two types of height.
   After applying radiographic inspection, defect morphologies were mapped
   to the mid-sections of the finite element models and the porosity
   fraction fields had been generated with interpolation method. ABAQUS
   input parameters were confirmed by trial simulations to the matrix
   specimen and comparison with experimental outcomes. Fine agreements of
   the result curves between simulations and experiments could be observed,
   and predicted positions of the tensile fracture were found to be in
   accordance with the tests. Chord modulus was used to obtain the
   equivalent elastic stiffness because of the non-linear features. The
   results showed that elongation was the most influenced term to the
   defect cast steel, compared with elastic stiffness and yield stress.
   Additional visual explanations on the tensile fracture caused by void
   propagation were also given by the result contours at different
   mechanical stages, including distributions of Mises stress and plastic

Abstract = {{Purpose: Quantitative molecular imaging of beta cell mass (BCM) would
   enable early detection and treatment monitoring of type 1 diabetes. The
   glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor is an attractive target due to
   its beta cell specificity and cell surface location. We quantitatively
   investigated the impact of plasma clearance and receptor internalization
   on targeting efficiency in healthy B6 mice.
   Procedures: Four exenatide-based probes were synthesized that varied in
   molecular weight, binding affinity, and plasma clearance. The GLP-1
   receptor internalization rate and in vivo receptor expression were
   quantified.
   Results: Receptor internalization (54,000 receptors/cell in vivo)
   decreased significantly within minutes, reducing the benefit of a
   slower-clearing agent. The multimers and albumin binding probes had
   higher kidney and liver uptake, respectively.
   Conclusions: Slow plasma clearance is beneficial for GLP-1 receptor
   peptide therapeutics. However, for exendin-based imaging of islets,
   down-regulation of the GLP-1 receptor and nonspecific background uptake
   result in a higher target-to-background ratio for fast-clearing agents.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability and optimization are two key elements for structural design.
   The reliability based topology optimization (RBTO) is a powerful and
   promising methodology for finding the optimum topologies with the
   uncertainties being explicitly considered, typically manifested by the
   use of reliability constraints. Generally, a direct integration of
   reliability concept and topology optimization may lead to computational
   difficulties. In view of this fact, three methodologies have been
   presented in this study, including the double-loop approach (the
   performance measure approach, PMA) and the decoupled approaches (the
   so-called Hybrid method and the sequential optimization and reliability
   assessment, SORA). For reliability analysis, the stochastic response
   surface method (SRSM) was applied, combining with the design of
   experiments generated by the sparse grid method, which has been proven
   as an effective and special discretization technique. The methodologies
   were investigated with three numerical examples considering the
   uncertainties including material properties and external loads. The
   optimal topologies obtained using the deterministic, RBTOs were compared
   with one another; and useful conclusions regarding validity, accuracy
   and efficiency were drawn.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the impacts of electricity allocation protocols on
   the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of electricity
   consumption. The selection of appropriate electricity allocation
   protocols, methodologies that assign pools of electricity generators to
   electricity consumers, has not been well standardized. This can lead to
   very different environmental profiles of similar, electricity-intensive
   processes. In an effort to better represent the interconnected nature of
   the U.S. electrical grid, we propose two new protocols that utilize
   inter-regional trade information and localized emission factors to
   combine generating pools that are sub- or supersets of one another. This
   new nested approach increases the likelihood of capturing important
   inter-regional electricity trading and the appropriate assignment of
   generator emissions to consumers of local and regional electricity. We
   applied the new and existing protocols to the U.S. primary aluminum
   industry, an industry whose environmental impact is heavily tied to its
   electricity consumption. Our analysis found GHG emission factors that
   were dramatically different than those reported in previous literature.
   We calculated production-weighted average emission factors of 19.0 and
   19.9kilograms carbon dioxide equivalentperkilogram of primary aluminum
   ingot produced when using our two nested electricity allocation
   protocols. Previous studies reported values of 10.5 and 11.0, at least
   42\% lower than those found by our study.}},

Title = {{Estimating Emissions from Electricity Generation Using Electricity
   Dispatch Models: The Importance of System Operating Constraints}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{42-53}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This article develops a modeling approach for estimating emissions
   (e.g., carbon dioxide) from nuclear, coal, natural gas, and hydropower
   generators in reaction to short-term changes to electricity demand. The
   modeling approach accounts for a set of operating constraints (OCs),
   including scheduled maintenance, forced outage, spinning reserves, fuel
   switching, seasonal output capacities, and seasonal hydro resource
   availability. It is found that these OCs are important to achieve
   reasonable estimates of electricity production by fuel type as well as
   associated emissions. This conclusion follows from an analysis of
   electric power generation by networks of power plants in Texas and New
   York in 2004 and 2005. The inputs to the model with operating
   constraints (OC model) developed in this article include hourly
   electricity demand, fuel costs, a list of power plants in the network,
   their basic generation characteristics, and the set of OCs developed in
   this article. Given these inputs, the OC model estimates the hourly
   amount of electricity generation by each power plant in the network,
   which leads to estimates of marginal resource consumption and emissions.
   Our central result is that historical annual and monthly generation by
   fuel type and efficiency are well estimated by the OC model and that the
   exclusion of OCs leads to poor estimates. This work can be combined with
   emerging work on wind and solar generation to provide a complete picture
   of contemporary grid dispatch and associated emissions.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the life cycle energy demand and greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions associated with substituting natural cellulose and kenaf
   in place of glass fibers in automotive components. Specifically, a 30
   wt\% glass-fiber composite component weighing 3kilograms (kg) was
   compared to a 30wt\% cellulose fiber composite component (2.65kg) and
   40wt\% kenaf fiber composite component (2.79kg) for six cars,
   crossovers, and sport utility vehicles. The use-phase fuel consumption
   of the baseline and substitute components, with and without powertrain
   resizing, were determined using a mass-induced fuel consumption model
   based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency test records. For all
   vehicles, compared to the baseline glass fiber component, using the
   cellulose composite material reduced life cycle energy demand by 9.2\%
   with powertrain resizing (7.2\% without) and reduced life cycle GHG
   emissions by 18.6\% with powertrain resizing (16.3\% without), whereas
   the kenaf composite component reduced energy demand by 6.0\% with
   powertrain resizing (4.8\% without) and GHG emissions by 10.7\% with

   the majority of the life cycle energy savings is realized in the

   concentration changes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Rn-222 and Rn-220 can be used as tracers of groundwater or submarine
   springs, and Rn-222 in water also could indicate indoor radon problems
   in some regions. The half-life of Rn-222 is long enough that its
   concentration may remain significant during transit over relatively long
   distances, while that of Rn-220 is not. Prior research revealed that it
   took about 15 min for the radon to achieve gas equilibrium at a water
   flow rate of 17.5 L min(-1), which is approximately equivalent to the
   time required for the Rn-222-Po-218 pair to approach radioactive
   equilibrium and is limiting in terms of measurements of sudden radon
   concentration change. In this work, an algorithm is applied to improve
   the continuous tracing of radon concentrations in the field environment.
   Results of a laboratory experiment analyzed applying the analysis method
   illustrated its ability to allow immediate identification of sharp
   concentration increases. In this paper we find that a precipitous drop
   in radon concentrations lead to improper corrected values as the result
   of measurement uncertainties prior to the drop, and a method using zero
   instead negative values for reducing the uncertainties under such
   condition also is proposed.}},

   signal quality using a computational model. Approach. A finite-element
   model of a Utah array microelectrode in neural tissue was coupled with a
   multi-compartmental model of a neuron to quantify the effects of
   encapsulation thickness, encapsulation resistivity, and interface
   resistivity on electrode impedance and waveform amplitude. The coupled
   model was then reconciled with the in vivo data. Histology was obtained
   seventeen weeks post-implantation to measure gliosis. Main results. From
   week 1-3, mean impedance and amplitude increased at rates of 115.8 k
   Omega/week and 23.1 mu V/week, respectively. This initial ramp up in
   impedance and amplitude was observed across all arrays, and is
   consistent with biofouling (increasing interface resistivity) and edema
   clearing (increasing tissue resistivity), respectively, in the model.
   Beyond week 3, the trends leveled out. Histology showed that thin scars
   formed around the electrodes. In the model, scarring could not match the
   in vivo data. However, a thin interface layer at the electrode tip
   could. Despite having a large effect on impedance, interface resistivity
   did not have a noticeable effect on amplitude. Significance. This study
   suggests that scarring does not cause an electrical problem with regard
   to signal quality since it does not appear to be the main contributor to
   increasing impedance or significantly affect amplitude unless it
   displaces neurons. This, in turn, suggests that neural signals can be
   obtained reliably despite scarring as long as the recording site has
   sufficiently low impedance after accumulating a thin layer of
   biofouling. Therefore, advancements in microelectrode technology may be
   expedited by focusing on improvements to the recording site-tissue
   interface rather than elimination of the glial scar.}},
