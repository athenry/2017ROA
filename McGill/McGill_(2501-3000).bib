Abstract = {{Numerical modelling has long been used as a powerful tool for
   geomechanics mine design and analysis of such problems as ore dilution.
   Open stoping mining method with delayed backfill is generally employed
   for mining steeply dipping tabular ore deposits. Several authors
   reported that consideration of production blast vibrations on adjacent,
   exposed backfill faces is crucial for the effective backfill design for
   minimum ore dilution due to fill failure. In this study, it is shown
   that blast vibrations can be characterized with dynamic numerical
   modelling. A FLAC(3D) dynamic numerical model has been developed for a
   typical layout of a secondary stope that is being mined next to a
   previously mined and backfilled primary stope. The numerical simulations
   are validated by comparing predicted failure geometry with
   laser-surveyed stope profiles obtained with a cavity monitoring system.
   It is shown that blast-induced vibrations can be a primary cause for
   wedge-type failure of the backfill face.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic decoding provides ultra-low-complexity hardware for
   high-throughput parallel low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders.
   Asynchronous stochastic decoding was proposed to demonstrate the
   possibility of low power dissipation and high throughput in stochastic
   decoders, but decoding might stop before convergence due to
   ``lock-up{''}, causing error floors that also occur in synchronous
   stochastic decoding. In this paper, we introduce a wire-delay dependent
   (WDD) scheduling algorithm for asynchronous stochastic decoding in order
   to reduce the error floors. Instead of assigning the same delay to all
   computation nodes in the previous work, different computation delay is
   assigned to each computation node depending on its wire length. The
   variation of update timing increases switching activities to decrease
   the possibility of the ``lock-up{''}, lowering the error floors. In
   addition, the WDD scheduling algorithm is simplified for the hardware
   implementation in order to eliminate time-averaging and multiplication
   functions used in the original WDD scheduling algorithm. BER performance
   using a regular (1024, 512) (3.6) LDPC code is simulated based on our
   timing model that has computation and wire delay estimated under ASPLA
   90nm CMOS technology. It is demonstrated that the proposed asynchronous
   decoder achieves a 6.4-9.8x smaller latency than that of the synchronous
   decoder with a 0.25-0.3 dB coding gain.}},

Abstract = {{A continuum model is utilized to extract the nonlinear governing
   equation for Carbon nanotube (CNT) probes near graphite sheets. The van
   der Waals (vdW) intermolecular force and electrostatic actuation are
   included in the equation of motion. Static and dynamic pull-in behavior
   of the system is investigated in this paper. To this end, a new
   asymptotic procedure is presented to predict the pull-in instability of
   electrically actuated CNTs by employing an analytic approach namely He's
   iteration perturbation method (IPM). The effects of basic
   non-dimensional parameters such as initial amplitude, intermolecular
   force, geometrical parameter and actuation voltage on the pull-in
   instability as well as the fundamental frequency are studied. The
   obtained results from numerical simulations by employing three mode
   assumptions verify the strength of the analytical procedure. The
   qualitative analysis of the system dynamics shows that the equilibrium
   points of the autonomous system include stable center points and
   unstable saddle nodes. The phase portraits of the carbon nanotube
   actuator exhibit periodic and homoclinic orbits.}},

Title = {{Fabrication, testing and modeling of a new flexible armor inspired from
   natural fish scales and osteoderms}},
Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Crocodiles, armadillo, turtles, fish and many other animal species have
   evolved flexible armored skins in the form of hard scales or osteoderms,
   which can be described as hard plates of finite size embedded in softer
   tissues. The individual hard segments provide protection from predators,
   while the relative motion of these segments provides the flexibility
   required for efficient locomotion. In this work, we duplicated these
   broad concepts in a bio-inspired segmented armor. Hexagonal segments of
   well-defined size and shape were carved within a thin glass plate using
   laser engraving. The engraved plate was then placed on a soft substrate
   which simulated soft tissues, and then punctured with a sharp needle
   mounted on a miniature loading stage. The resistance of our segmented
   armor was significantly higher when smaller hexagons were used, and our
   bio-inspired segmented glass displayed an increase in puncture
   resistance of up to 70\% compared to a continuous plate of glass of the
   same thickness. Detailed structural analyses aided by finite elements
   revealed that this extraordinary improvement is due to the reduced span
   of individual segments, which decreases flexural stresses and delays
   fracture. This effect can however only be achieved if the plates are at
   least 1000 stiffer than the underlying substrate, which is the case for
   natural armor systems. Our bio-inspired system also displayed many of
   the attributes of natural armors: flexible, robust with `multi-hit'
   capabilities. This new segmented glass therefore suggests interesting
   bio-inspired strategies and mechanisms which could be systematically
   exploited in high-performance flexible armors. This study also provides
   new insights and a better understanding of the mechanics of natural
   armors such as scales and osteoderms.}},

Abstract = {{Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear polysaccharide expressed on cell
   surfaces, in extracellular matrices and cellular granules in metazoan
   cells. Through non-covalent binding to growth factors, morphogens,
   chemokines, and other protein families, HS is involved in all
   multicellular physiological activities. Its biological activities depend
   on the fine structures of its protein-binding domains, the determination
   of which remains a daunting task. Methods have advanced to the point
   that mass spectra with information-rich product ions may be produced on
   purified HS saccharides. However, the interpretation of these complex
   product ion patterns has emerged as the bottleneck to the dissemination
   of these HS sequencing methods. To solve this problem, we designed
   HS-SEQ, the first comprehensive algorithm for HS de novo sequencing
   using high-resolution tandem mass spectra. We tested HS-SEQ using
   negative electron transfer dissociation (NETD) tandem mass spectra
   generated from a set of pure synthetic saccharide standards with diverse
   sulfation patterns. The results showed that HS-SEQ rapidly and
   accurately determined the correct HS structures from large candidate
   pools.}},

Abstract = {{Microscale biaxial accelerometers are required to be sensitive to
   applied accelerations and manufacturable by means of
   microelectromechanical systems technology. In order to meet these
   requirements, a compliant realization of biaxial accelerometers, dubbed
   simplicial biaxial accelerometers, has been proposed, as reported in
   this paper. Notched joints, to realize what is termed Pi-joints in the
   parallel-robots literature, are employed and then improved by the
   introduction of Lame-shaped hinges serving as flexible joints. The
   sensitivity of the simplicial biaxial accelerometers in estimating
   accelerations is investigated and validated by means of finite element
   analysis. The sensing system is embedded in the simplicial biaxial
   accelerometers, with piezoresistive sensing technology adopted in the
   instrumentation design. Using the principles of piezoresistive sensing,
   the electronic layout is developed for the accelerometer. Through the
   piezoresistive analysis implemented on the finite element model of the
   simplicial biaxial accelerometers, the matrix that maps voltage signals
   into acceleration signals is derived. By virtue of both the structural
   and electronic designs, the accelerometer is observed to be sensitive to
   accelerations in its plane, but fairly insensitive to accelerations in
   any of the other four directions of the rigid-body motion. Finally,
   prototypes were fabricated with microelectromechanical systems
   technology to test the microfabrication feasibility of the structure and
   measurement system of the accelerometer. Test results are the subject of
   a forthcoming paper.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption and degradation of levonorgestrel (LNG) by two hydrophytes,

   investigated under light-shielding conditions in the water column.
   Variations of LNG concentrations in water, plant root epidermis, root,
   stem and leaf of the plants were analyzed. The results indicated that
   the removal efficiency of LNG by hydrophytes over the period of 50 days
   was significantly greater than the blank control (p < 0.05), with the
   removal rates of 79.80\% +/- 3.10\% and 78.86\% +/- 2.55\% for CA and
   EC, respectively. Compared with bio-adsorption, bio-conversion of LNG
   was found to be the dominant elimination pathway, evidenced by
   relatively high conversion rates (77.31\% +/- 2.68\% for CA and 77.82\%
   +/- 2.95\% for EC), while the adsorption rates were lower (1.77\% +/-
   0.90\% for CA and 1.05\% +/- 0.40\% for EC). The bio-adsorption and
   conversion of LNG showed no significant differences between the two
   hydrophytes. Additionally, the mineralization on root epidermis played
   an important role in the reduction a LNG in water. (C) 2014 The Research

Abstract = {{Physico-chemical changes in ripe tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)
   were analyzed on day 0 and 2 weeks after ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light
   treatment or modified atmosphere (MA) storage and combined UV-C + MA
   storage at 10 A degrees C. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) film was
   used to create MA conditions. The tomatoes were evaluated for surface
   colour, mass loss, firmness, respiration rate, total soluble solids and
   antioxidant capacity. The tomatoes treated with UV-C and MA storage
   underwent least changes in their physico-chemical properties, indicating
   that combination of UV-C and MA storage was successful in retaining the
   attributes of the fresh product. The increase in antioxidant capacity of
   the tomatoes during UV-C treatment suggested that UV treatment during
   post harvest handling may be successfully combined with MA storage,
   resulting in a product with better nutritive value.}},

Abstract = {{Private car ownership plays a vital role in the daily travel decisions
   of individuals and households. The topic is of great interest to policy
   makers given the growing focus on global climate change, public health,
   and sustainable development issues. Not surprisingly, it is one of the
   most researched transportation topics. The extant literature on car
   ownership models considers the influence of exogenous variables to
   remain the same across the entire population. However, it is possible
   that the influence of exogenous variable effects might vary across the
   population. To accommodate this potential population heterogeneity in
   the context of car ownership, the current paper proposes the application
   of latent class versions of ordered (ordered logit) and unordered
   response (multinomial logit) models. The models are estimated using the
   data from Quebec City, Canada. The latent class models offer superior
   data fit compared to their traditional counterparts while clearly
   highlighting the presence of segmentation in the population. The
   validation exercise using the model estimation results further
   illustrates the strength of these models for examining car ownership
   decisions. Moreover, the latent class unordered response models perform
   slightly better than the latent class ordered response models for the
   metropolitan region examined.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium-free phosphate-based glasses (PGs) doped with both SiO2 and TiO2
   (50P(2)O(5)-40CaO-xSiO(2)-(10-x)TiO2, where x = 10, 7, 5, 3, and 0
   mol\%) were developed and characterised for controlled ion release
   applications in bone tissue engineering. Substituting SiO2 with TiO2
   directly increased PG density and glass transition temperature,
   indicating a cross-linking effect of Ti on the glass network which was
   reflected by significantly reduced degradation rates in an aqueous
   environment. X-ray diffraction confirmed the presence of Ti(P2O7) in
   crystallised TiO2-containing PGs, and nuclear magnetic resonance showed
   an increase in Q(1) phosphate species with increasing TiO2 content.
   Substitution of SiO2 with TiO2 also reduced hydrophilicity and surface
   energy. In biological assays, MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts effectively
   adhered to the surface of PG discs and the incorporation of TiO2, and
   hence higher stability of the PG network, significantly increased cell
   viability and metabolic activity indicating the biocompatibility of the
   PGs. Addition of SiO2 increased ionic release from the PG, which
   stimulated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in MC3T3-E1 cells upon
   ion exposure. The incorporation of 3 mol\% TiO2 was required to
   stabilise the PG network against unfavourable rapid degradation in
   aqueous environments. However, ALP activity was greatest in PGs doped
   with 5-7 mol\% SiO2 due to up-regulation of ionic concentrations. Thus,
   the properties of PGs can be readily controlled by modifying the extent
   of Si and Ti doping in order to optimise ion release and osteoblastic
   differentiation for bone tissue engineering applications. (C) 2014

Volume = {{70}},

Abstract = {{Numerical models are increasingly being used to assess the stability of
   mine openings, and forming an integral part of operational and safety
   decisions. A key factor in obtaining realistic model results is the
   correct simulation of the pre-mining stress regime in a heterogeneous
   rockmass with complex geometries. When in-situ stress measurement
   results are available, or if an estimate can be made based on the
   vertical stress gradient in the region, the model can be calibrated
   based on these values and relied upon to replicate the rockmass behavior
   in the held. The calibration of a numerical model with a heterogeneous
   rockmass cannot be reduced to analytical solutions due to the numerous
   variables involved, especially under elastoplastic conditions or in the
   vicinity of geological structures. In this paper, a systematic and
   iterative calibration methodology is presented - based on two different
   methods of in-situ stress determination - that uses boundary tractions
   for a mine-wide numerical model of a deep Canadian mine. The effects of
   lateral and vertical model dimensions, as well as mesh density, are
   examined to verify the adaptability of the methodology to these changes
   under linear elastic conditions. In addition, the model is calibrated
   under elastoplastic conditions and in the presence of a shear zone. It
   is shown that regardless of any of the modifications, model calibration
   can be conducted with the proposed methodology. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper examines the maintenance of satellite formations using two

   It is assumed that the satellites are equipped with solar flaps or

   satellite formations in LEO while solar flaps is applied to formations
   in LEO as well as GEO. The simple control laws based on open-loop and
   closed-loop control methods are designed for required rotation of the
   flaps to achieve desired formation keeping. The feasibility of the
   proposed schemes is proven via stability analyses followed by numerical
   simulations. A linear flap rotation scheme is found to keep the relative
   position errors bounded to +/- 5 m. The proposed control methods show
   the effectiveness of the use of solar radiation pressure and aerodynamic

Abstract = {{Precipitates (ppts) in new generation aluminum-lithium alloys (AA2099
   and AA2199) were characterised using scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy and atom probe tomography. Results obtained on the following
   ppts are reported: Guinier-Preston zones, T-1 (Al2CuLi), beta' (Al3Zr)
   and delta' (Al3Li). The focus was placed on their composition and the
   presence of minor elements. X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry in the
   electron microscopes and mass spectrometry in the atom probe microscope
   showed that T-1 ppts were enriched in zinc (Zn) and magnesium up to
   about 1.9 and 3.5 at.\%, respectively. A concentration of 2.5 at.\% Zn
   in the delta' ppts was also measured. Unlike Li and copper, Zn in the
   T-1 ppts could not be detected using electron energy-loss spectroscopy
   in the transmission electron microscope because of its too low
   concentration and the small sizes of these ppts. Indeed, Monte Carlo
   simulations of EEL spectra for the Zn L-2,L-3 edge showed that the
   signal-to-noise ratio was not high enough and that the detection limit
   was at least 2.5 at.\%, depending on the probe current. Also, the
   simulation of X-ray spectra confirmed that the detection limit was
   exceeded for the Zn K-alpha X-ray line because the signal-to-noise ratio
   was high enough in that case, which is in agreement with our
   observations.}},

Title = {{Energy loss, a novel biomechanical parameter, correlates with aortic
   aneurysm size and histopathologic findings}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Energy loss is a biomechanical parameter that represents the
   relative amount of energy absorbed by the aorta during the cardiac
   cycle. We aimed to correlate energy loss with ascending aortic aneurysm
   size and histopathologic findings to elucidate the pathophysiology of
   aneurysm complications.
   Methods: Aneurysmal ascending aortic specimens were obtained during
   surgery. Control specimens were obtained from autopsy and organ donors.
   Biaxial tensile tests were performed on the 4 quadrants of the aortic
   ring. Energy loss was calculated using the integral of the stress-strain
   curve during loading and unloading. It was compared with the size and
   the traditional biomechanical parameter, stiffness (apparent modulus of
   elasticity). Elastin, collagen, and mucopolysaccharide content were
   quantified using Movat pentachrome staining of histology slides.
   Results: A total of 41 aortas were collected (34 aneurysmal, 7 control).
   The aneurysms exhibited increased stiffness (P < .0001) and energy loss
   (P < .0001) compared with the controls. Energy loss correlated
   significantly with aortic size (P < .0001, r(2) = .60). A hinge point
   was noted at a diameter of 5.5 cm, after which energy loss increased
   rapidly. The relationship between energy loss and size became strongly
   linear once the size was indexed to the body surface area (P < .0001,
   r(2) = .78). Energy loss correlated with the histopathologic findings,
   especially the collagen/elastin ratio (P = .0002, r(2) = .49). High
   energy loss distinguished patients with pathologic histologic findings
   from others with similar diameters.
   Conclusions: As ascending aortas dilate, they exhibit greater energy
   loss that rapidly increases after 5.5 cm. This mirrors the increase in
   complications at this size. Energy loss correlates with imbalances in
   elastin and collagen composition, suggesting a measurable link between
   the histopathologic features and mechanical function.}},

Title = {{Structure-guided approach for detecting large domain inserts in protein
   sequences as illustrated using the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily}},

Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In multi-domain proteins, the domains typically run end-to-end, that is,
   one domain follows the C-terminus of another domain. However,
   approximately 10\% of multi-domain proteins are formed by insertion of
   one domain sequence into that of another domain. Detecting such
   insertions within protein sequences is a fundamental challenge in
   structural biology. The haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF) serve
   as a challenging model system wherein a variable cap domain (similar to
   5-200 residues in length) accessorizes the ubiquitous Rossmann-fold core
   domain, with variations in insertion site and topology corresponding to
   different classes of cap types. Herein, we describe a comprehensive
   computational strategy, CapPredictor, for determining large, variable
   domain insertions in protein sequences. Using a novel sequence-alignment
   algorithm in conjunction with a structure-guided sequence profile from
   154 core-domain-only structures, more than 40,000 HADSF member sequences
   were assigned cap types. The resulting data set afforded insight into
   HADSF evolution. Notably, a similar distribution of cap-type classes
   across different phyla was observed, indicating that all cap types
   existed in the last universal common ancestor. In addition, comparative
   analyses of the predicted cap-type and functional assignments showed
   that different cap types carry out similar chemistries. Thus, while cap
   domains play a role in substrate recognition and chemical reactivity,
   cap-type does not strictly define functional class. Through this
   example, we have shown that CapPredictor is an effective new tool for
   the study of form and function in protein families where domain
   insertion occurs.}},

Abstract = {{All available experimental data on phase equilibria and thermodynamic
   properties of the Pb-Pr, Pb-Nd, Pb-Tb and Pb-Dy binary systems were
   reviewed and critically examined. A thermodynamic optimization of these
   systems is presented for the first time. A set of optimized model
   parameters for all solid stoichiometric compounds, terminal solid
   solutions and liquid phase was built to reproduce all available reliable
   thermodynamic properties and phase diagram data within experimental
   error limits. The Modified Quasichemical Model in the pair approximation
   was used to describe the thermodynamic properties of the liquid solution
   accurately. In view of the limited experimental phase diagram and
   thermodynamic data available for these systems, trends in the rare
   earth-lead and rare earth-tin systems were examined to estimate the
   missing information and evaluate whether the predictions are reasonable.
   Based on these trends, a predicted phase diagram for the Pb-Nd and Pb-Tb
   systems, which are not established to date, is presented. (C) 2014

Title = {{Burning rates and temperatures of flames in excess-enthalpy burners: A
   numerical study of flame propagation in small heat-recirculating tubes}},
Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2348-2360}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates flame propagation in small
   thermally-participating tubes where the wall acts as a
   heat-recirculating medium. This fundamental configuration allows heat in
   the combustion products to be recirculated into the reactants, resulting
   in excess enthalpy and enhanced burning rates. Preheating of the
   reactants by heat recirculation has traditionally been considered to be
   the dominant mechanism leading to large burning rates observed in such
   systems. This is mainly supported by results from physical models based
   on a one-dimensional (1-D) representation of the system, where the
   radial diffusion of heat from wall surface to channel centerline is not
   accurately captured. In this study, a 2-D formulation with conjugate
   heat transfer, which accurately resolves the transport of heat inside
   the gas-wall system, is used to model the excess-enthalpy phenomenon.
   Steadily-propagating stoichiometric methane-air flames are simulated
   inside an adiabatic tube of finite wall-thickness, over a wide range of
   inlet flow velocities and small tube diameters. Burning-rate enhancement
   is found to be caused not only by preheating, associated with heat
   recirculation, but also by an increase in flame-front area. Flame
   elongation is more pronounced with increasing tube diameter and inlet
   velocity, up to a point where the change in flame-front area becomes
   dominant in enhancing burning rate. In that case, heat recirculation is
   a necessary condition for flames to couple to the thermal wave in the
   wall and elongate, but does not provide a significant increase in
   enthalpy or temperature that would otherwise be needed for high burning
   rates to be observed. As the diameter is reduced, the effect of
   preheating becomes increasingly important for burning-rate enhancement
   compared to flame area increase. At very small diameters, smaller than
   the flame thickness, the increase in burning rate is seen to be
   predominantly attributable to preheating. However, preheating is seen to
   become limited as inflow velocity is increased, due to 2-D effects
   inside the fluid that interfere with heat recirculation. These findings
   demonstrate that 2-D effects inside the fluid can have a prohibitive
   influence on the burning-rate enhancement attributed to preheating, but
   that they also give rise to an additional mechanism, associated with the
   change in flame surface area, responsible for burning-rate enhancement
   in heat-recirculating burners. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{Associative memories retrieve stored information given partial or
   erroneous input patterns. A new family of associative memories based on
   Sparse Clustered Networks (SCNs) has been recently introduced that can
   store many more messages than classical Hopfield-Neural Networks (HNNs).
   In this paper, we propose fully-parallel hardware architectures of such
   memories for partial or erroneous inputs. The proposed architectures
   eliminate winner-take-all modules and thus reduce the hardware
   complexity by consuming 65 \% fewer FPGA lookup tables and increase the
   operating frequency by approximately 1.9 times compared to that of
   previous work. Furthermore, the scaling behaviour of the implemented
   architectures for various design choices are investigated. We explore
   the effect of varying design variables such as the number of clusters,
   network nodes, and erased symbols on the error performance and the
   hardware resources.}},

Abstract = {{Transport theorems, such as that named after Reynolds, are an important
   tool in the field of continuum physics. Recently, Seguin and Fried used
   Harrison's theory of differential chains to establish a transport
   theorem valid for evolving domains that may become irregular. Evolving
   irregular domains occur in many different physical settings, such as
   phase transitions or fracture. Here, emphasizing concepts over
   technicalities, we present Harrison's theory of differential chains and
   the results of Seguin and Fried in a way meant to be accessible to
   researchers in continuum physics. We also show how the transport theorem
   applies to three concrete examples and approximate the resulting terms
   numerically. Furthermore, we discuss how the transport theorem might be
   used to weaken certain basic assumptions underlying the description of
   continua and the challenges associated with doing so.}},

Abstract = {{A method was developed to determine the metabolic respiration rate (RRm)
   of fresh produce during the transient period at the beginning of a
   hyperbaric treatment. This method allowed for the correction in the
   apparent respiration rate (RRap) by considering the dilution effect of
   flushing the system and the error associated with gas solubilisation as
   the gas partial pressure varied. The dilution process was simulated by
   using the general equation for exhaust ventilation, thus allowing for
   the elimination of the dilution effect during the calculation of the net
   respiration rate (RRN). The error associated with the CO2 solubilisation
   in the flesh of the produce was solved by measuring the CO2 solubility
   in the tissues of tomato at various CO2 partial pressures and using this
   value to generate a mass balance of CO2 within the system. The RRm was
   estimated by incorporating the initial respiration rate (RRi) of
   untreated fruits with the respiration rate at equilibrium (RRe). The
   kinetic of the RRm was proposed to follow a negative exponential
   equation. The constant value (k) of the RRm model was found to decrease
   exponentially with the partial pressure of CO2 at equilibrium which
   affected the amount of gas solubilised and the time to reach
   equilibrium. The developed method should be validated for the RRm of
   other produce during the transient period at the beginning of a
   hyperbaric treatment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of two acoustic speaker adaptation
   techniques applied in the context of the subspace Gaussian mixture model
   (SGMM) for automatic speech recognition (ASR). First, a model space
   linear regression based approach is presented for adaptation of SGMM
   state projection vectors and is referred to as subspace vector
   adaptation (SVA). Second, an easy to implement realization of
   constrained maximum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) is presented
   for feature space adaptation in the SGMM. Numerically stable procedures
   for row-by-row estimation of the regression based transformation
   matrices are presented for both SVA and CMLLR adaptation. These
   approaches are applied to SGMM models that are estimated using speaker
   adaptive training (SAT), a technique for estimating more compact speaker
   independent acoustic models. Unsupervised speaker adaptation performance
   is evaluated on conversational and read speech task domains and compared
   to unsupervised adaptation performance obtained using the hidden Markov
   model-Gaussian mixture model (HMM-GMM) in ASR. It is shown that the
   feature space and model space adaptation approaches applied to the SGMM
   provide complementary reductions in word error rate (WER) and provide
   lower WERs than that obtained using CMLLR adaptation for the HMM-GMM.}},

Abstract = {{Extruded Mg alloys usually display strong basal fiber textures, which
   are related to poor formability. Inspired by the texture weakening
   effect of the addition of rare earths (RE) to Mg alloys, two Mg-Ca
   alloys were designed and a range of extrusion conditions were explored
   in attempts to reproduce this effect. Constant strain rate and strain
   rate change compression tests were performed on the specially prepared
   Mg-0.5Ca and Mg-1Ca alloys. Dynamic strain aging (DSA) was observed to
   take place in both alloys over a well-defined temperature and strain
   rate range. Seven extrusion trials were then carried out on the Mg-0.5Ca
   alloy within and external to the DSA range of conditions. From the
   resulting textures and microstructures, it is concluded that the aOE (c)
   11-21 > (RE) texture component is formed when extrusion is carried out
   while DSA is taking place. The occurrence of this type of texture
   weakening is attributed to the promotion of recrystallization within the
   shear bands formed when the rate sensitivity is negative. The latter in
   turn arises because of the DSA taking place in the presence of solute
   Ca.}},

Title = {{Spatial Correlation of Hemodynamic Changes Related to Interictal
   Epileptic Discharges with Electric and Magnetic Source Imaging}},
Journal = {{HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes at
   the time of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) identify their
   associated vascular/hemodynamic responses. BOLD activations and
   deactivations can be found within the epileptogenic zone but also at a
   distance. Source imaging identifies electric (ESI) and magnetic (MSI)
   sources of IEDs, with the advantage of a higher temporal resolution.
   Therefore, the objective of our study was to evaluate the spatial
   concordance between ESI/MSI and BOLD responses for similar IEDs.
   Methods: Twenty-one patients with similar IEDs in simultaneous
   electroencephalogram/functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG/fMRI)
   and in simultaneous EEG/magnetoencephalogram (MEG) recordings were
   studied. IEDs in EEG/fMRI acquisition were analyzed in an event-related
   paradigm within a general linear model (GLM). ESI/MSI of averaged IEDs
   was performed using the Maximum Entropy on the Mean. We assessed the
   spatial concordance between ESI/MSI and clusters of BOLD
   activations/deactivations with surface-based metrics. Results: ESI/MSI
   were concordant with one BOLD cluster for 20/21 patients (concordance
   with activation: 14/21 patients, deactivation: 6/21 patients, no
   concordance: 1/21 patients; concordance with MSI only: 3/21, ESI only:
   2/21). These BOLD clusters exhibited in 19/20 cases the most significant
   voxel. BOLD clusters that were spatially concordant with ESI/MSI were
   concordant with IEDs from invasive recordings in 8/11 patients
   (activations: 5/8, deactivations: 3/8). Conclusion: As the results of

Title = {{Pedestrian preferences with respect to roundabouts-A video-based stated
   preference survey}},

Abstract = {{Research on user behavior and preferences has been a helpful tool in
   improving road safety and accident prevention in recent years. At the
   same time, there remain some important areas of road safety and accident
   prevention for which user preferences, despite their importance, have
   not been explored. Most road safety research has not explicitly
   addressed vulnerable user (pedestrians and cyclists) preferences with
   respect to roundabouts, despite their increasing construction around the
   world. The present research stems from the fact that studies related to
   roundabout safety have generally focused on drivers, while overlooking
   the importance of safety as it relates to vulnerable users, especially
   pedestrians. Moreover, it handles this particular issue through an
   approach that has not been used so far in this context; the Stated
   Preference (SP) survey. As such, there are two main goals (and
   contributions) of this work. First, to show how SP surveys can be used
   to investigate the importance of different design and operational
   features to pedestrian perceptions of safety in roundabouts. This allows
   us, for example, to quantify how some features of roundabouts (e.g. high
   traffic volume) can be compensated for by design features such as
   pedestrian islands. This is useful in helping to design roundabouts that
   pedestrians prefer and will hopefully use, to help encourage active
   transport. Second, to demonstrate how traffic simulation software can be
   successfully used to include difficult-to-communicate attributes in SP
   surveys. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We characterize the operation of self-pulsating sources made of two
   optical regenerators in cascade, namely a first regenerator of the type
   self-phase modulation spectral broadening and offset filtering, followed
   by a second regenerator of the type supercontinuum generation and offset
   filtering. The range of operation of this laser is explored as the
   wavelength and bandwidths of the band-pass filters are adjusted. We also
   provide experimental evidence that soliton self-frequency shift
   emanating from modulation instability triggers bursts of pulses at the
   repetition rate of the cavity. The stochastic nature of sources based on
   this concept leads to shot-to-shot pulse fluctuations in the cavity,
   which on average result in a flat supercontinuum extending beyond 1900
   nm. Finally, a seed pulse can be sustained efficiently via this laser
   architecture, and the cavity consequently generates subpicosecond pulses
   at one of its output.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative physical models for non oriented electrical steels require

   Describing the structure-property relationships in these materials is
   made difficult in that all of the parameters have an effect On magnetic
   properties. In the present study, a set of non-oriented electrical steel
   specimens are examined, where chemistry and grain size are kept similar
   from sample to sample, but texture is varied. A new texture parameter
   called Magnetic Texture Factor is introduced which is defined as the
   ratio of the volume fractions of < 100 > direction to < 111 > direction
   along magnetization vector. It was found that this Magnetic Texture
   Factor was a better parameter for identifying trends of magnetic
   properties with crystallographic texture than the often used Texture
   factor, which is described as the ratio of the volume fractions of
   \{100\} planes to \{111\} planes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the abilities of Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANN), Least Squares - Support Vector Regression (LS-SVR), Fuzzy Logic,
   and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) techniques to improve
   the accuracy of daily pan evaporation estimation in sub-tropical
   climates. Meteorological data from the Karso watershed in India
   (consisting of 3801 daily records from the year 2000 to 2010) were used
   to develop and test the models for daily pan evaporation estimation. The
   measured meteorological variables include daily observations of
   rainfall, minimum and maximum air temperatures, minimum and maximum
   humidity, and sunshine hours. Prior to model development, the Gamma Test
   (GT) was used to derive estimates of the noise variance for each
   input-output set in order to identify the most useful predictors for use
   in the machine learning approaches used in this study. The ANN models
   consisted of feed forward backpropagation (FFBP) models with Bayesian
   Regularization (BR), along with the LevenbergMarquardt (LM) algorithm. A
   comparison was made between the estimates provided by the ANN, LSSVR,
   Fuzzy Logic, and ANFIS models. The empirical Hargreaves and Samani
   method (HGS), as well as the Stephens-Stewart (SS) method, were also
   considered for comparison with the newer machine learning methods. The
   Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Correlation Coefficient (CORR) were
   the statistical performance indices that were used to evaluate the
   accuracy of the various models. Based on the comparison, it was found
   that the Fuzzy Logic and LS-SVR approaches can be employed successfully
   in modeling the daily evaporation process from the available climatic
   data. In addition, results showed that the machine learning models
   outperform the traditional HGS and SS empirical methods. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Compact, power efficient, and fiber-compatible lasers, wavelength

   device that provides the functions of a Stokes Raman-parametric laser, a
   four-wave mixing anti-Stokes wavelength converter, an ultra-broadband
   Stokes/anti-Stokes Raman amplifier and a supercontinuum generator. The
   device operation relies on ultrahigh Raman and Kerr gain that are up to
   five orders of magnitude larger than in silica fibers, precisely
   engineered chromatic dispersion, and high photosensitivity of the
   chalcogenide microwire. Owing to the underlying principle of nonlinear
   optical processes, the device is anticipated to operate over the entire

Abstract = {{To produce the magnetic core of electric motors, nonoriented electrical
   steels (NOESs) are used with an electrically insulating coating applied

   In this study, the effect of the coating is examined, specifically, its
   role in creating a residual stress near the coating/steel interface.
   This stress was investigated by the nanoindentation technique. With this
   method, a similar to 30 mu m deep affected area was observed for NOES
   along both the rolling and transverse cross section directions, when in
   the presence of the coating. A biaxial tensile stress of similar to 200
   MPa was calculated from the measured hardness values in the NOES, which
   was linked to variations in the magnetic domain structure near the
   interface. The observed magnetic domain structure was simplified by the
   reduction of supplemental domain structure near the coating/steel
   interface.}},

Abstract = {{We have fabricated and characterized large area graphene ion sensitive
   field effect transistors (ISFETs) with tantalum pentoxide sensing layers
   and demonstrated pH sensitivities approaching the Nernstian limit. Low
   temperature atomic layer deposition was used to deposit tantalum
   pentoxide atop large area graphene ISFETs. The charge neutrality point
   of graphene, inferred from quantum capacitance or channel conductance,
   was used to monitor surface potential in the presence of an electrolyte
   with varying pH. Bare graphene ISFETs exhibit negligible response, while
   graphene ISFETs with tantalum pentoxide sensing layers show increased
   sensitivity reaching up to 55 mV/pH over pH 3 through pH 8. Applying the
   Bergveld model, which accounts for site binding and a Guoy-Chapman-Stern
   picture of the surface-electrolyte interface, the increased pH
   sensitivity can be attributed to an increased buffer capacity reaching
   up to 10(14) sites/cm(2). ISFET response was found to be stable to
   better than 0.05 pH units over the course of two weeks. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{A digital compensation scheme based on a perturbation theory for
   mitigation of cross-phase modulation (XPM) distortions is developed for
   dispersion-managed fiber-optic communication systems. It is a
   receiver-side scheme that uses a hard-decision unit to estimate data for
   the calculation of XPM fields using the perturbation technique. The
   intra-channel nonlinear distortions are removed by intra-channel digital
   backward propagation (DBP) based on split-step Fourier scheme before the
   hard-decision unit. The perturbation technique is shown to be effective
   in mitigating XPM distortions. However, wrong estimations in the
   hard-decision unit result in performance degradation. A hard-decision
   correction method is proposed to correct the wrong estimations.
   Numerical simulations show that the hybrid compensation scheme with DBP
   for dispersion and intra-channel nonlinear impairments compensation and
   the perturbation technique for XPM compensation brings up to 3.7 dBQ and
   1.7 dBQ improvements as compared with the schemes of linear compensation
   only and intra-channel DBP, respectively. The perturbation technique for
   XPM compensation requires only one-stage (or two-stage when
   hard-decision correction is applied) compensation and symbol-rate signal
   processing. (C)2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We present a Silicon Photonic (SiP) intensity modulator operating at 1.3

   transmission employing a digital to analog converter for the RF signal

   transmitter's frequency response. Details of the SiP Mach-Zehnder
   interfometer are presented. We study the system performance at various
   bit rates, PAM orders and propagation distances. To the best of our
   knowledge, we report the first demonstration of a 112 Gb/s transmission
   over 10 km of SMF fiber operating below pre-FEC BER threshold of 3.8 x
   10(-3) employing PAM-8 at 37.4 Gbaud using a fully packaged SiP
   modulator. An analytical model for the Q-factor metric applicable for
   multilevel PAM-N signaling is derived and accurately experimentally
   verified in the case of Gaussian noise limited detection. System
   performance is experimentally investigated and it is demonstrated that
   PAM order selection can be optimally chosen as a function of the desired
   throughput. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed transmitter to
   exhibit software-defined transmission for short reach applications by
   selecting PAM order, symbol rate and pulse shape. (C) 2014 Optical

Abstract = {{The demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases has risen
   in the last decade. On-site diagnosis of single or multiple pathogens
   using portable devices is the first step in this endeavour. Despite

   current technologies are still restricted to detecting known pathogens
   with limited detection accuracy. Developing new detection techniques for
   rapid and accurate detection of multiple plant pathogens and their
   associated variants is essential. Recent single DNA sequencing
   technologies are a promising new avenue for developing future portable
   devices for plant pathogen detection. In this review, we detail the
   current progress in portable devices and technologies used for detecting
   plant pathogens, the current position of emerging sequencing
   technologies for analysis of plant genomics, and the future of portable

Abstract = {{Nanoscale TiO2 attracts a lot of research interest as a Li-ion
   intercalation material. By far anatase in different nanostructures
   including nanosheets and mesoporous particles has been the center of
   attention. In this work the Li-ion intercalation behavior of another
   less explored nanoscale TiO2 phase, brookite, is studied. In particular
   the study focuses on a unique mesoporous nanoplatelet structured
   brookite material synthesized via a novel aqueous solution process.
   These unique mesoporous single crystal brookite nanoplatelets (mNPl;
   135m(2)g(-1) surface area with 5-10 x 20 x 50 nm dimensions and 2-8 nm
   pore size) provide both favorable large electrolyte/material interface
   and short Li-ion diffusion length, important considerations for good
   Li-ion intercalation performance. A study of the mechanism of lithiation
   using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at different states of
   discharging and X-ray diffraction of the lithiated and delithiated mNPl
   brookite is reported along cycling data at different rates. It is shown
   that a solid-solution forms upon lithiation corresponding to
   orthorhombic Li0.5TiO2 that is isostructural with brookite. The brookite
   nanoplatelets were found to progressively undergo crystal structure
   enhancement upon cycling despite certain lattice distortion occurring
   during lithiation that allows them to quickly relax upon delithiation in
   an extremely efficient (> 99.7\% coulombic efficiency) reversible manner
   translating to excellent Li-ion intercalation stability. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{To achieve an enhanced degradation of recalcitrant organic silicone
   wastewater in the fluidized-bed Fenton process was attempted using three
   different carrier substrates {[}quartz sand, brick particles and
   granular activated carbon (GAC)]. Quartz sand was determined as the best
   carrier substrate due to better reactor bed expansion, fluidized state
   and pollutant removal rate than the brick particles and GAC. The iron
   oxide components such as FeOOH, FeO, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4 were found on the
   surface of coated quartz sand using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
   The optimal hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 60 min was determined
   based on COD and TOC removal rate. Further, the optimal operating
   conditions of pH 3.5, H2O2/COD (mass ratio) 2.6:1, H2O2/Fe2+ (molar
   ratio) 13.6:1 and quartz sand filling rate of 35\% were determined by
   the orthogonal experiments for the recalcitrant treatment. In the
   fluidized-bed Fenton process treated effluent COD value was 40 mg/L and
   TOC value was 20 mg/L, with a removal rate of 95\% and 85\%,
   respectively. Compared to the traditional Fenton process the COD and TOC
   removal rates were found to increase by 20\% and 15\% respectively.
   Furthermore, the total iron removal rate was higher than conventional
   Fenton process, which significantly reduced the iron concentration in
   effluent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to remove copper ions from dilute copper
   solution using an innovative material known as air-filled emulsion
   (APE). APE is composed of microscopic bubbles enclosed by a thin film of
   cysteine-rich protein distributed through the aqueous solution. The
   method using AFE as an extractant is combination of air-assisted solvent
   extraction (AASX) and biosorption techniques. The data obtained from
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) clearly showed the thiol, amino and carboxylic groups of bovine
   serum albumin (BSA) and egg white protein (EWP)-coated bubbles being
   responsible for copper adsorption. Moreover, it was also observed that
   manipulation of experimental conditions such as solution pH,
   temperature, biosorbent and copper concentration had a significant
   impact on copper ion uptake. Higher solution pH led to a greater metal
   uptake for both egg white protein emulsion (EWPEM) and bovine serum
   albumin emulsion (BSAEM). At lower pH, copper removal diminished and no
   copper removal was obtained at pH 2 due to the high concentration of
   hydrogen ions. The increase of copper uptake with temperature rise was
   due to both the exposure of more functional groups that were initially
   buried in the interior of the protein structure and an increase in
   reaction kinetics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Supported phospholipid bilayers (SPBs) are valuable models for
   fundamental studies of biological membranes and their interaction with
   biologically relevant solutes or particles. Herein, we demonstrate the
   capability of the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
   monitoring (QCM-D) to directly detect the gel-fluid phase transition of
   a SPB. The approach involves comparison of the frequency response of a
   bare and a bilayer-coated QCM-D crystal during linear temperature
   variation. Phase transition results in a change of the resonance
   frequency that coincides directly with the accompanied change in bilayer
   thickness detected by ellipsometry. Experiments performed at different
   heating rates further demonstrate the use of dissipation monitoring to
   determine the phase transition temperature based on the
   temperature-induced viscosity changes of the ambient medium in the
   immediate environment of the bilayer. Unlike other methods, the proposed
   approach enables precise determination of the phase transition of a SPB
   without the need for thermal equilibration of the measurement chamber
   and, thus, has great potential for sensitive detection of structural
   and/or compositional changes of the bilayer.}},

Title = {{Fate and transport of monensin in the presence of nonionic surfactant
   Brij35 in soil}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},

Abstract = {{As freshwater is a limited resource in many parts of the world, the use
   of wastewater for irrigation has become an important alternative.
   Therefore, many countries facing a water deficit, use partially treated,
   or even untreated, wastewater. This may increase the input of many
   contaminants into the environment. In the present study, we investigated
   the effect of using surfactant rich water in irrigation on the mobility
   of the most commonly-used veterinary antibiotic, monensin. Nine PVC
   lysimeters, 1.0 m long x 0.45 m diameter, were packed with a sandy soil
   to a bulk density of 1.35 Mg m(-3). Cattle manure, containing monensin,
   was applied at the surface of the lysimeters at the recommended rate of
   10 t/ha. Each of three aqueous Brij 35 solutions, 0, 0.5 and 5 g L-1,
   was applied to the lysimeters in triplicate. Over a 90 day period, soil
   and leachate samples were collected and analyzed. The results of the
   laboratory sorption experiment showed that when the nonionic surfactant
   Brij 35 is present, the sorption coefficient of monensin was reduced
   significantly from 120.22 mL g(-1) in the aqueous medium to 112.20, 100
   and 63.09 mL g(-1) with Brij35 concentrations of 0.25, 2.5 and 5 g L-1,
   respectively. The lysimeter results indicated a significant downward
   movement of monensin at depths of 60 cm in the soil profile and leachate
   in the presence of the surfactant. Thus, the continuous use of poor
   quality water could influence the transport of monensin in agricultural
   soils, and consequently, pose a risk for groundwater pollution. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Sewage epidemiology has been proven as an effective approach to estimate
   the use of illicit drugs by a population. In this study, sewage analysis
   was applied to examine the patterns of amphetamine (AMP) and
   methamphetamine (METH) uses in the urban area of Beijing. Influent and
   effluent samples were collected from all the thirteen sewage treatment
   plants (STPs) in the urban area during two sampling campaigns. METH
   concentrations in influents were found to range from several tens to
   several hundred ng.L-1, whereas AMP concentrations ranged from several
   to several tens ng.L-1. The concentration ratios between AMP and METH in
   influents at most STPs were close to the rate of AMP excretion following
   METH ingestion, indicating that AMP in sewage in Beijing was
   predominately from the metabolism of METH. Much higher METH loads were
   observed in the center part of the urban area in Beijing, indicating a
   strong correlation between METH use and economic level and entertainment
   activities. Seasonal variation in METH loads was significant, with
   greater use in summer than in winter. Significant difference in METH
   loads between weekdays and weekend days were observed in winter but not
   in summer. No clear trend in diurnal variation of METH use was observed.
   Nearly complete removal of METH occurred at the STPS in Beijing.
   Apparent removal rates of AMP were lower than those of METH, likely due
   to degradation of METH into AMP during the wastewater treatment
   processes. In summary, this study represents the first application of
   sewage epidemiology to the entire urban population of a metropolitan in
   mainland China and provided an overview of METH and AMP uses in the
   city. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Variant selection during secondary and tertiary twinning in pure
   titanium}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{198-211}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Three generations of twins were identified by electron backscatter
   diffraction techniques in pure titanium subjected to uniaxial
   compression at room temperature. Many primary contraction twins were
   observed as the initial texture was favourable for their formation.
   Numerous secondary extension twins formed within the primary contraction
   twins and some tertiary contraction twins within the secondary extension
   twins. The orientations of these three generations of twins were
   determined and their associated Schmid factors (SFs) were calculated.
   The formation of the twin variants selected in each generation and the
   absence of certain potential variants are explained by rotating the
   twinning displacement gradient tensor expressed in the twin system
   reference frame into the crystal reference frame of the relevant
   neighbouring grain. The presence of the observed secondary and tertiary
   twins is accounted for in terms of the ease of imposing the required
   accommodation strains on their neighbours. The results show that
   secondary twins can form even with low SFs as long as their
   accommodation takes place by prismatic or basal glide. However, the
   formation of certain second and third generation potential high SF twins
   was impeded when this would have required accommodation by the most
   difficult deformation mode: pyramidal glide. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{Energy-proportional optical interconnections are enabled by
   semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) remaining off (or idle) when not
   routing data. In this letter, the physical layer scalability of
   SOA-based optical space switches configured with different gain and loss
   is assessed using an experimental recirculating loop. Results show that
   for a gain/loss configuration of 13.0 dB, optical multichannel packets
   successfully propagate through a series of 14 SOAs with a bit-error-rate
   <10(-9), which indicates that a single-stage space switch can scale up
   to 10(9) ports. Scalability improves for lower gain/loss configuration
   at the cost of more SOAs per routing path. As expected, scalability is
   limited by cross-gain modulation and optical signal-to-noise ratio
   degradation, but their detrimental impact depends on the architecture
   configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Correctly simulating evapotranspiration (ET) and surface energy balance
   is essential to simulating crop growth under water and heat stress
   conditions in agricultural systems. The revised hybrid model (RZSHAW),
   combining the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) and Simultaneous
   Heat and Water (SHAW) model, was evaluated for simulating ET and surface
   energy balance components against observed data from an eddy covariance
   system in a wheat-maize double cropping system in the North China Plain
   (NCP), after it was calibrated for soil water content and crop growth.
   The average daily ET was slightly under-simulated by 0.05 mm in the
   wheat seasons and over-simulated by 0.23 mm in the maize seasons,
   compared with the observed latent heat flux (LE) from 2003 to 2005. The
   root mean squared error (RMSE) and model efficiency (ME) of simulated
   daily ET were 0.59 mm and 0.86 for the three years. The goodness of
   simulation for Rn (net radiation), LE, H (sensible heat flux) and canopy
   temperature was better in the middle crop seasons than in the early crop
   seasons. The RMSE values for simulated Rn, H, LE, G (ground heat flux),
   and canopy temperature were 31.9, 37.2, 37.9, 21.8 W m-2, and 1.37 C,
   respectively, for middle wheat seasons and were 29.2, 27.1, 29.7, 19.7W
   m-2, and 1.22 C, respectively, for middle maize seasons. These
   simulation results were comparable with previous modeling studies,
   indicating that the revised hybrid model is reasonable for simulating

Abstract = {{Chitosan blends have been widely investigated to create biomaterials
   with desirable physicochemical and biological properties for tissue
   engineering applications. A recurring difficulty, however, has been to
   maintain their stability in an aqueous environment. The rationale behind
   this study was to demonstrate that genipin crosslinking can improve and
   maintain the stability of chitosan/poly-L-lysine (PLL) blends. Four gel
   formulations were prepared by varying the weight ratios of chitosan and
   PLL. Electron microscopy revealed that genipin crosslinking provided a
   more homogenous gel surface compared to uncrosslinked gels. Moreover, it
   was discovered that 3 h was sufficient to stabilize the gels. In vitro
   studies using fibroblasts demonstrated that genipin-crosslinked gels

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that the morphological diversity in liquid-crystal hybrid
   systems is much richer than previously anticipated. More importantly, we
   reveal the existence of a dual mechanism for self-assembly of
   nanoparticles via morphological instabilities at phase boundaries. Using
   numerical simulations, we study the growth of isolated nematic droplets
   in an isotropic liquid crystal (LC) doped with nanoparticles (NPs) and
   provide insight into the nature of microstructure evolution in LC
   hybrids. Our work expands the numerically accessible time and length
   scales in these systems, capturing morphologies which develop under the
   competition of nonequilibrium elastic interactions, diffusive
   instabilities mediated by NP transport, and the anisotropy of the
   nematic field. By mapping nematic morphologies, we also propose a
   methodology for estimating various important LC material parameters that
   are difficult to obtain experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchically porous polymers with controllable pore size were
   generated through a novel polymer blending strategy in an A/B/C-B-C
   ternary blend system. Polylactide/high-density
   polyethylene/poly(styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene) triblock copolymer
   (PLA/HDPE/SEBS) was used as a model system to demonstrate this
   technique. During melt blending, the SEBS was driven into the HDPE phase
   owing to the presence of the PE block in the copolymer. With proper
   volume fractions of PLA/HDPE/SEBS (e.g., 50/25/25), a bi-modal, dual
   co-continuous morphology was obtained and hierarchically porous
   polymeric materials were further generated by selectively removing the
   PLA and SEBS phases. Annealing and compositional variation were further
   employed to control the pore size and it is shown that the length scales
   of the two co-continuous morphologies can be controlled independently.

Abstract = {{In order to ensure input-output stability for plants experiencing

   theorem for both stability analysis and controller design. Given a

   procedure is presented. This procedure can be used to assess
   input-output stability of the violated plant and original controller via
   the conic sector theorem. Should input-output stability not be ensured,
   two original controller synthesis methods are suggested: one is designed
   to mimic the controller, and the other is inspired by strictly positive
   real controller synthesis. Both methods guarantee input-output stability
   by selecting controllers within appropriate conic sectors, and involve
   only the evaluation of readily solvable linear matrix inequalities and
   algebraic Riccati equations. Along with details on computational
   considerations, numerical simulations are provided, demonstrating the

Abstract = {{In a mining complex, the mine is a source of supply of valuable material
   (ore) to a number of processes that convert the raw ore to a saleable
   product or a metal concentrate for production of the refined metal. In
   this context, expected variation in metal content throughout the extent
   of the orebody defines the inherent uncertainty in the supply of ore,
   which impacts the subsequent ore and metal production targets.
   Traditional optimization methods for designing production phases and
   ultimate pit limit of an open pit mine not only ignore the uncertainty
   in metal content, but, in addition, commonly assume that the mine
   delivers ore to a single processing facility. A stochastic network flow
   approach is proposed that jointly integrates uncertainty in supply of
   ore and multiple ore destinations into the development of production
   phase design and ultimate pit limit. An application at a copper mine
   demonstrates the intricacies of the new approach. The case study shows a
   14\% higher discounted cash flow when compared to the traditional
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Adequate fate descriptors are crucial input parameters in models used to
   predict the behaviour and transport of a contaminant in the environment
   and determine predicted environmental concentrations for risk
   assessment. When new fate models are being developed for emerging
   contaminants, such as engineered nanoparticles (ENPs), special care has
   to be applied in adjusting conventional approaches and fate descriptors
   to a new set of substances. The aim of this paper is to clarify
   misconceptions about the applicability of equilibrium partition
   coefficients, such as the octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow) or
   the soil-water distribution coefficient (K-d), whose application in the
   context of ENP fate assessment is frequently suggested despite lacking
   scientific justification. ENPs are present in the environment as
   thermodynamically unstable suspensions and their behaviour must be
   represented by kinetically controlled attachment and deposition
   processes as has been established by colloid science. Here, we
   illustrate the underlying theories of equilibrium partitioning and
   kinetically controlled attachment and discuss why the use of any
   coefficient based on equilibrium partitioning is inadequate for ENPs and
   can lead to significant errors in ENP fate predictions and risk
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic pull-in instability of vibrating nano-actuators in the presence
   of actuation voltage is studied in this paper through introducing the
   closed form expression for the fundamental frequency of beam-type
   nano-structure. The fringing field effect and dispersion forces (Casimir
   and van der Waals attractions) are taken into account in the dynamic
   governing equation of motion. The influences of initial amplitude of
   vibration, applied voltage and intermolecular forces on the dynamic
   pull-in behavior and fundamental frequency are investigated by a modem
   asymptotic approach namely Parameter Expansion Method (PEM). It is
   demonstrated that two terms in series expansions are sufficient to
   produce an acceptable solution of the actuated nano-structure. The
   obtained results from numerical methods by considering three mode
   assumptions verify the strength of the analytical procedure. The
   qualitative analysis of system dynamic shows that the equilibrium points
   of the autonomous system include stable center points and unstable
   saddle nodes. The phase portraits of the nano-beam actuator exhibit
   periodic and homoclinic orbits. (C) 2014 Politechnika Wroclawska.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{8, SI}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a computational approach for the collapse assessment
   of concentrically braced frames (CBFs) subjected to earthquakes.
   Empirical formulations for modeling the postbuckling behavior and
   fracture of three main steel brace shapes that are commonly used in CBFs
   are developed. These formulations are based on extensive calibrations of
   a fiber-based steel brace model with available information from a
   recently developed steel brace database. As part of the same
   computational approach, the representation of strength and stiffness
   deterioration associated with plastic hinging in steel columns and
   gusset-plate beam-to-column connections is considered. Through a case
   study of a 12-story Special Concentrically Braced Frame (SCBF), the
   influence of classical damping on the collapse capacity of CBFs is
   investigated. It is demonstrated that when SCBFs attain a negative
   stiffness during an earthquake, their collapse capacity can be
   significantly overestimated, if viscous damping is based on a commonly
   employed Rayleigh assumption with initial stiffness approximation. It is
   shown that sidesway collapse of CBFs should be traced based on a
   combination of criteria that associate large story drift ratios and the
   story shear resistance of a CBF at the corresponding story drift ratios.

Abstract = {{Increased incidences of mixed assemblages of microcystin-producing and
   nonproducing cyanobacterial strains in freshwater bodies necessitate
   development of reliable proxies for cyanotoxin risk assessment.
   Detection of microcystin biosynthetic genes in water blooms of
   cyanobacteria is generally indicative of the presence of potentially
   toxic cyanobacterial strains. Although much effort has been devoted
   toward elucidating the microcystin biosynthesis mechanisms in many
   cyanobacteria genera, little is known about the impacts of co-occurring
   cyanobacteria on cellular growth, mcy gene expression, or mcy gene copy
   distribution. The present study utilized conventional microscopy, qPCR
   assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study how competition
   between microcystin-producing Microcystis aeruginosa CPCC 299 and
   Planktothrix agardhii NIVA-CYA 126 impacts mcyE gene expression, mcyE
   gene copies, and microcystin concentration under controlled laboratory
   conditions. Furthermore, analyses of environmental water samples from
   the Missisquoi Bay, Quebec, enabled us to determine how the various
   potential toxigenic cyanobacterial biomass proxies correlated with
   cellular microcystin concentrations in a freshwater lake. Results from
   our laboratory study indicated significant downregulation of mcyE gene
   expression in mixed cultures of M. aeruginosa plus P. agardhii on most
   sampling days in agreement with depressed growth recorded in the mixed
   cultures, suggesting that interaction between the two species probably
   resulted in suppressed growth and mcyE gene expression in the mixed
   cultures. Furthermore, although mcyE gene copies and McyE transcripts
   were detected in all laboratory and field samples with measureable
   microcystin levels, only mcyE gene copies showed significant positive
   correlations (R-2 > 0.7) with microcystin concentrations, while McyE
   transcript levels did not. These results suggest that mcyE gene copies
   are better indicators of potential risks from microcystins than McyE
   transcript levels or conventional biomass proxies, especially in water
   bodies comprising mixed assemblages of toxic and nontoxic cyanobacteria.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an energy-efficient power allocation strategy for
   Nakagami-m flat-fading channels with a delay-outage probability
   constraint. The operating input transmit power value is limited to
   P-max. The energy efficiency (EE), expressed in units of b/J/Hz, is
   represented as the ratio of the effective capacity to the sum of
   transmission power (P-t) and circuit power (P-c). Since the
   EE-maximization objective function is quasi-concave, a unique global
   maximum exists. By using fractional programming, we develop an
   EE-optimal power allocation strategy that consists of two steps: 1)
   obtaining the power level (P) over bar (un), at which the maximum EE can
   be achieved, and 2) distributing the power optimally based on the
   minimum of P-max and (P) over bar (un). We prove that while (P) over bar
   (un) monotonically increases with P-c, the maximum achievable EE is a
   monotonically decreasing function of P-c. The analysis further allows us
   to derive the EE of three important cases: non-fading channels,
   extremely stringent delay-limited systems, and systems with no delay
   constraints. Simulation results confirm analytical derivations and
   further show the effects of the circuit power, fading duration, and
   fading severeness on the achievable EE and effective capacity of a
   delay-limited fading channel.}},

Abstract = {{Nature shows many examples of surfaces with extraordinary wettability,
   which can often be associated with particular air-trapping surface
   patterns. Here, robust non-wetting surfaces have been created by
   femtosecond laser ablation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The
   laser-created surface structure resembles a forest of entangled fibers,
   which support structural superhydrophobicity even when the surface
   chemistry is changed by gold coating. SEM analysis showed that the
   degree of entanglement of hairs and the depth of the forest pattern
   correlates positively with accumulated laser fluence and can thus be
   influenced by altering various laser process parameters. The resulting
   fibrous surfaces exhibit a tremendous decrease in wettability compared
   to smooth PTFE surfaces; droplets impacting the virgin or gold coated
   PTFE forest do not wet the surface but bounce off. Exploratory
   bioadhesion experiments showed that the surfaces are truly air-trapping
   and do not support cell adhesion. Therewith, the created surfaces
   successfully mimic biological surfaces such as insect wings with robust
   anti-wetting behavior and potential for antiadhesive applications. In
   addition, the fabrication can be carried out in one process step, and
   our results clearly show the insensitivity of the resulting non-wetting
   behavior to variations in the process parameters, both of which make it
   a strong candidate for industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating joint disorder resulting from an
   incompletely understood combination of mechanical, biological, and
   biochemical processes. OA is often accompanied by inflammation and pain,
   whereby cytokines associated with chronic OA can up-regulate expression
   of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF). Several
   studies suggest a role for cytokines and NGF in OA pain, however the
   effects of changing mechanical properties in OA tissue on chondrocyte
   metabolism remain unclear. Here, we used high-extension silicone rubber
   membranes to examine if high mechanical strain (HMS) of primary
   articular chondrocytes increases inflammatory gene expression and
   promotes neurotrophic factor release. HMS cultured chondrocytes
   displayed up-regulated NGF, TNF alpha and ADAMTS4 gene expression while
   decreasing TLR2 expression, as compared to static controls. HMS culture
   increased p38 MAPK activity compared to static controls. Conditioned
   medium from HMS dynamic cultures, but not static cultures, induced
   significant neurite sprouting in PC12 cells. The increased neurite
   sprouting was accompanied by consistent increases in PC12 cell death.
   Low-frequency high-magnitude mechanical strain of primary articular
   chondrocytes in vitro drives factor secretion associated with
   degenerative joint disease and joint pain. This study provides evidence
   for a direct link between cellular strain, secretory factors,
   neo-innervation, and pain in OA pathology.}},

Abstract = {{Increased risk of bone fractures is observed in patients with chronic
   inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and
   rheumatoid arthritis. Members of the Interferon Response Factor family
   of transcriptional regulators, IRF1 and IRF8, have been identified as
   genetic risk factors for several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune
   diseases. We have investigated a potential role for the Irf1 gene in
   bone metabolism. Here, we report that Irf1(-/-) mutant mice show altered
   bone morphology in association with altered trabecular bone architecture
   and increased cortical thickness and cellularity. Ex vivo studies on
   cells derived from bone marrow stimulated with Rank ligand revealed an
   increase in size and resorptive activity of tartrate-resistant
   acid-positive cells from Irf1(-/-) mutant mice compared with wild-type
   control mice. Irf1 deficiency was also associated with decreased
   proliferation of bone marrow-derived osteoblast precursors ex vivo,
   concomitant with increased mineralization activity compared with control
   cells. We show that Irf1 plays a role in bone metabolism and suggest
   that Irf1 regulates the maturation and activity of osteoclasts and
   osteoblasts. The altered bone phenotype of Irf1(-/-) mutants is
   strikingly similar to that of Stat1(-/-) mice, suggesting that the two
   interacting proteins play a critical enabling role in the common
   regulation of these two cell lineages.}},

   addition of HCl, and at various ionic strengths by addition of NaCl and
   CaCl2. The results show that the primary electroviscous effect
   significantly increases the intrinsic viscosity. The intrinsic viscosity
   under conditions where the surface charge of nanofibrils is fully
   screened is in good agreement with the predictions of classical theory
   for dispersions of rodlike particles at low shear rates. Increasing the
   ionic strength up to kappa d approximate to 1 decreases the intrinsic
   viscosity; at kappa d > 1, the intrinsic viscosity increases because of
   fibril aggregation and increase of the effective volume fraction.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its compactness, high heat and mass transfer rate and ease of
   manufacture, coiled/spiral tube has been widely used in process
   industries, especially as heat exchangers and chemical reactors. This
   study addresses the mass-transport enhancement and reaction performance
   in in-plane spiral reactor with various cross sections geometries, i.e.
   circular, half-circular, rectangular, square, trapezoidal and
   triangular, at fixed cross-section area at several Reynolds numbers. The
   mass transfer performance is compared with those of straight channel
   counterpart. Laminar flow of gas with catalytic reactions is
   investigated using a validated three-dimensional computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) model. The results suggest that spiral ducts offer better
   reaction performance as compared to straight duct, especially at higher
   Reynolds number. However, it imposes higher pressure drop. Amongst
   various cross-section, the coil reactor with half-circular geometry
   yields the highest reaction performance. This study can provide insight
   for design guidelines of high performance coiled reactor. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this letter, we investigate a joint power and rate optimization for a
   multihop relay network with incremental redundancy hybrid ARQ (HARQ-IR),
   where multiple relays are serially connected from a source to a

   rate and power of each node in order to maximize long-term average
   transmission rate (LATR) for given sum-power and delay constraints,
   which is unfortunately not mathematically tractable. Hence, we propose a
   sub-optimal algorithm to improve the LATR, which is computationally
   efficient and has comparable performance with the exhaustive search
   algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
   outperforms the conventional algorithms, including the HARQ-IR scheme
   with fixed power and rate and the Chase-combining HARQ scheme of which
   both power and rate are optimized for the same network.}},

Abstract = {{Large-amplitude vibrations of liquid-filled cantilevered (clamped-free)
   circular cylindrical tanks are studied theoretically for the first time.
   The influence of liquid height and initial geometric imperfections is
   investigated in detail. The tank motions are described by a nonlinear
   model based on Flugge's shell theory, and the liquid motions are
   modelled by means of linearized potential flow theory. Equations of
   motion are obtained using the extended Hamilton's principle and are
   discretized by expanding the solution with trigonometric functions in
   the circumferential direction and the cantilevered beam eigenfunctions
   in the axial direction. The geometric boundary conditions are satisfied
   exactly, while the natural ones are satisfied in an energy minimization
   sense. The system is integrated numerically by employing the appropriate
   modal composition of the solution to guarantee convergence. Results are
   presented in the form of frequency-response curves in the neighbourhood
   of the lowest natural frequency. It is found that the response may be of
   softening or hardening type, depending on the liquid height and the
   imperfection parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of a pipe conveying fluid flexibly restrained at the ends}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{360-385}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The subject of this paper is the study of dynamics and stability of a
   pipe flexibly supported at its ends and conveying fluid. First, the
   equation of motion of the system is derived via the extended form of
   Hamilton's principle for open systems. In the derivation, the effect of
   flexible supports, modelled as linear translational and rotational
   springs, is appropriately considered in the equation of motion rather
   than in the boundary conditions. The resulting equation of motion is
   then discretized via the Galerkin method in which the eigenfunctions of
   a free-free Euler Bernoulli beam are utilized. Thus, a general set of
   second-order ordinary differential equations emerges, in which, by
   setting the stiffness of the end-springs suitably, one can readily
   investigate the dynamics of various systems with either classical or
   non-classical boundary conditions. Several numerical analyses are
   initially performed, in which the eigenvalues of a simplified system (a
   beam) with flexible end-supports are obtained and then compared with
   numerical results, so as to verify the equation of motion, in its
   simplified form. Then, the dynamics of a pinned-free pipe conveying
   fluid is systematically investigated, in which it is found that a
   pinned-free pipe conveying fluid is generally neutrally stable until it
   becomes unstable via a Hopf bifurcation leading to flutter. The next
   part of the paper is devoted to studying the dynamics of a pinned-free
   pipe additionally constrained at the pinned end by a rotational spring.
   A wide range of dynamical behaviour is seen as the mass ratio of the
   system (mass of the fluid to the fluid+ pipe mass) varies. It is
   surprising to see that for a range of rotational spring stiffness, an
   increase in the stiffness makes the pipe less stable. Finally, a pipe
   conveying fluid supported only by a translational and a rotational
   spring at the upstream end is considered. For this system, the critical
   flow velocity is determined for various values of spring constants, and
   several Argand diagrams along with modal shapes of the unstable modes
   are presented. The dynamics of this system is found to be very complex
   and often unpredictable (unexpected). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An melt-mixing process has been used to prepare Poly(ethylene

   delamination. In this method, steam was fed into a twin-screw extruder
   (TSE) to reduce the PET molecular weight and to facilitate their
   diffusion into the gallery spacing of organoclays. Subsequently, the
   molecular weight (MW) reduction of the PET matrix due to hydrolysis by
   water was compensated by solid-state polymerization (SSP). The effect of
   the thermodynamic compatibility of PET and organoclays on the exfoliated
   microstructure of the nanocomposites was also examined by using three
   different nanoclays. The dispersion of Cloisite 30B (C30B) in PET was
   found to be better than that of Nanomer I.28E (I28E) and Cloisite Na+.
   The effect of feeding rate and consequently residence time on the
   properties of PET nanocomposites was also investigated. The results
   reveal more delamination of organoclay platelets in PET-C30B
   nanocomposites processed at low feeding rate compared to those processed
   at high feeding rate. Enhanced mechanical and barrier properties were
   observed in PET nanocomposites after SSP compared to the nanocomposites
   prepared by conventional meltmixing. (C) 2013 Society of Plastics

Abstract = {{This study investigates the impacts of transit improvement strategies on
   bus emissions along a busy corridor in Montreal, Canada. The local
   transit provider, Societe de Transport de Montreal, has implemented a
   number of strategies which include the use of smart cards, limited-stop
   (express bus) service, and reserved bus lanes along this corridor. Using
   data collected on-board for instantaneous speeds and stop-level
   ridership, we estimated bus emissions of greenhouse gases and other
   pollutants at three levels: road segment, bus-stop, and per passenger. A
   regression of segment-level emissions against a number of explanatory
   variables reveals that reserved bus lanes and express bus service reduce
   emissions significantly. On the other hand, smart card use reduces
   idling emissions compared to other fare payment methods. Our findings
   are of most relevance for transit planners who are seeking to implement
   different strategies to reduce emissions and improve transit
   performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater depletion poses a significant threat in arid and semi-arid
   areas where rivers are usually ephemeral and groundwater is the major
   source of water. The present study investigated whether an effective
   water resources management strategy, capable of minimizing evaporative
   water losses and groundwater depletion while providing water for
   expanded agricultural activities, can be achieved through aquifer
   storage and recovery (ASR) implemented in conjunction with water storage
   in an ephemeral river. A regional development modeling framework,
   including both ASR and a dam design developed through system dynamics
   modeling, was validated using a case study for the Sirik region of Iran.
   The system dynamics model of groundwater flow and the comprehensive
   system dynamics model developed in this study showed that ASR was a
   beneficial strategy for the region's farmers and the groundwater system,
   since the rate of groundwater depletion declined significantly (from
   14.5 meters per 40 years to three meters over the same period).
   Furthermore, evaporation from the reservoir decreased by 50 million
   cubic meters over the simulation period. It was concluded that the
   proposed system dynamics model is an effective tool in helping to
   conserve water resources and reduce depletion in arid regions and
   semi-arid areas.}},

Abstract = {{A dual-layer electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) mushroom structure is
   proposed in this paper. Based on the concept of slow-wave propagation,
   this structure can reduce the size of multi-element microstrip patch
   antennas (MPAs) by 61\%. While the mushroom inner layer aids in the
   antenna miniaturization, the more compact upper layer acts as a
   band-stop filter further reducing the mutual coupling between the
   miniaturized patch antenna elements, which is otherwise not possible for
   a single-layer EBG structure. Various 2- and 4-element miniaturized MPAs
   are proposed for 2.5-GHz band applications, with antenna elements
   closely spaced at 0.5 lambda and low mutual coupling levels in the range
   of -28 dB to -50 dB. Furthermore, the achievable
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel capacities of these
   miniaturized multi-antennas are analyzed using the Kronecker channel
   model and tested in various propagation scenarios like the anechoic
   chamber, reverberation chamber and indoor. It is observed that the
   miniaturized MPAs can provide significant gains in MIMO capacity in all
   the signal scattering environments and are close to the theoretical
   limit of i.i.d. Rayleigh fading.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence and persistence of complex blooms comprising multiple
   toxigenic cyanobacteria genera pose significant challenges for water
   quality management worldwide. The co-occurrence of morphologically
   indistinguishable toxic and non-toxic strains makes monitoring and
   control of these noxious organisms particularly challenging.
   Conventional monitoring approaches are not only incapable of
   discriminating toxic from non-toxic strains but also have proven to be
   less sensitive and specific. In this study, a multiplex quantitative
   real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach was developed and
   tested for its sensitivity and specificity at detecting, differentiating
   and estimating potentially toxic Anabaena, Microcystis and Planktothrix
   genotype compositions in environmental samples. The oligonucleotide
   primers and probes utilized were designed to target portions of the
   microcystin synthetase (mcy) E gene that encode synthesis of the unique
   3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4,6-dienoic acid (ADDA)
   moiety of microcystins in the three target genera. Laboratory evaluation
   showed the developed assay to be highly sensitive and specific at
   detecting and quantifying targeted genera. Indeed, the assay standards
   for the Anabaena, Microcystis and Planktothrix reactions attained
   efficiencies above 90 \%, with coefficients of determination
   consistently above 0.99. Analysis of water samples from Missisquoi Bay,
   Quebec, Canada, resulted in successful detection and quantification of
   target toxigenic cyanobacteria even when cell numbers were below the
   detection limit for the conventional microscopy methods. Furthermore,
   toxigenic Microcystis spp. were found to be the main putative
   microcystin-producing cyanobacteria in the study lake. The qPCR
   technique developed in this study therefore offers simultaneous
   detection, differentiation and quantification of multiple toxigenic
   cyanobacteria that otherwise cannot be accomplished by current
   monitoring approaches.}},

   diffusion speed to density wave speed) and the Reynolds Re and Deborah
   De numbers. Concentration gradients act as a sound source in the density
   wave equation that feeds back into the mass diffusion equation
   producing, under sufficiently low Ma oscillatory spinodal decomposition.
   This oscillatory effect is generally suppressed by viscosity and
   enhanced by elasticity. The limiting standing waves (1/Re -> 0, 1/Ma(2)
   -> 0, De -> 0) that can be generated include elasto-acoustic,
   viscoelastic, and visco-acoustic. Concentration fluctuations accompanied
   with density fluctuations generate velocity, which are a unique feature
   of acousto-spinodal decomposition. The role of elasticity on the rate of
   demixing and selection of length scales is characterized; it is found
   that at high viscosity and low mass diffusion, higher elasticity De is
   required to reach absolute maximum growth rate R-infinity(max), which
   corresponds to an incompressible Euler fluid. Total structure factor
   calculations are shown to be qualitatively consistent with experiments
   at low wave vectors. Acousto-spinodal decomposition is a novel process
   that offers new processing and characterization routes for polymer
   solutions and melts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the impact of weather on the use of urban
   bicycle facilities in Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver and Portland, as well
   as on the Green Route in Quebec. This research makes use of long-term
   hourly and daily counts collected automatically using inductive loop
   detectors. The count data locations are organized into two groups -
   utilitarian and recreational. Using regression models with
   autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) errors, the direct impact and
   lagged effects of weather variables on hourly and daily bicycle counts
   are investigated. Among the main findings, temperature and humidity are
   positively and negatively associated with cycling, respectively, with a
   non-linear association in most cases. Precipitation has a significant
   negative impact on cycling flows, and its effect was observed to
   increase with rain intensity. Lagged effects of rain were also observed,
   such as the effect of rain in the previous three hours, rain in the
   morning only, and rain in the afternoon only. Furthermore, urban bicycle
   flows are more sensitive to weather on weekends than on weekdays, and
   recreational facilities are more sensitive than utilitarian facilities.

Abstract = {{In polyorogenic regions, the superposition of structures during a
   protracted tectonic history produces complex fractured bedrock aquifers.
   Thrust-faulted regions, in particular, have complicated permeability
   patterns that affect groundwater flow paths, quantity, and quality. In
   the Appalachian foreland of northwestern Vermont, numerous bedrock wells
   that are spatially related to the Paleozoic Hinesburg thrust have
   elevated naturally occurring radioactivity and/or low yields. The
   association of groundwater quality and quantity issues with this thrust
   was a unique opportunity to investigate its structural and hydrogeologic
   framework. The Hinesburg thrust juxtaposed metamorphic rocks of the
   hanging wall with sedimentary rocks of the footwall during the
   Ordovician. It was then deformed by two orthogonal Devonian fold sets
   and was fractured during the Cretaceous. Median well yields in the
   hanging wall aquifer are significantly lower than those of the footwall
   aquifer, consistent with the respective permeability contrast between
   metamorphic and carbonate rocks. For wells drilled through the Hinesburg
   thrust, those completed closest (vertically) to the thrust have the
   highest median yields, whereas others completed farther below have
   yields in the footwall range. The geochemical signature of the hanging
   wall and footwall aquifers correlates with their whole-rock
   geochemistry. The hanging wall aquifer is enriched in alpha radiation,
   Na+K-Cl, Ba, and Sr, whereas the footwall aquifer is enriched in
   Ca-Mg-HCO3 and alkalinity. Wells that penetrated the Hinesburg thrust
   generally have hanging wall geochemical signatures. A simple
   hydrogeologic model for the permeability evolution of the Hinesburg
   thrust involves the ductile emplacement of a low-K hanging wall onto a
   high-K footwall, with subsequent modification by fractures.}},

Abstract = {{Transient brain oscillatory activities recorded with
   Eelectroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) are
   characteristic features in physiological and pathological processes.
   This study is aimed at describing, evaluating, and illustrating with
   clinical data a new method for localizing the sources of oscillatory
   cortical activity recorded by MEG. The method combines time-frequency
   representation and an entropic regularization technique in a common
   framework, assuming that brain activity is sparse in time and space.
   Spatial sparsity relies on the assumption that brain activity is
   organized among cortical parcels. Sparsity in time is achieved by
   transposing the inverse problem in the wavelet representation, for both
   data and sources. We propose an estimator of the wavelet coefficients of
   the sources based on the maximum entropy on the mean (MEM) principle.
   The full dynamics of the sources is obtained from the inverse wavelet
   transform, and principal component analysis of the reconstructed time
   courses is applied to extract oscillatory components. This methodology
   is evaluated using realistic simulations of single-trial signals,
   combining fast and sudden discharges (spike) along with bursts of
   oscillating activity. The method is finally illustrated with a clinical
   application using MEG data acquired on a patient with a right
   orbitofrontal epilepsy.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of using porous aluminum particles in solid propellants were
   studied, with emphasis on the agglomeration phenomena. Burning strands
   containing either regular (as-received) or porous aluminum were
   photographed by a high-speed camera, and particulate combustion products
   were analyzed in a laser particle analyzer. Results obtained from
   experiments conducted in a pressure-range of 1-34 atmospheres show that
   porous aluminum particles produce smaller agglomerates than regular
   aluminum. The median diameter of agglomerates resulting from porous
   aluminum reached, on average, 70\% of the one originating from regular
   aluminum. This reduction in agglomerate diameter corresponds to a
   substantial volume (and hence, mass) decrease of approximately 65\%. It
   is assumed that the high-specific area of the porous aluminum particles
   (10-18m(2)/g, similar to that of nano-Al) results in high reactivity,
   leading to shorter ignition time and hence to the formation of smaller
   agglomerates.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Aims: This study investigated the effects of return activated sludge
   (RAS) ozonation, on the bacterial community structure of pilot-scale
   wastewater treatment systems.
   Methods and Results: Two parallel activated sludge reactors were
   operated to treat real municipal wastewater for 98 days. The RAS of one
   of the reactors was subjected to increasing doses of ozone during the
   experimental period, which resulted in higher reduction in biosolids
   waste production and higher bacterial growth rate. The bacterial
   community structures were investigated by 16S rRNA gene amplicon
   high-throughput pyrosequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization
   (FISH). The structures remained highly similar throughout the experiment
   despite the ozone treatment. Comparative analyses between pyrosequencing
   and FISH revealed clear discrepancies in the proportion of some
   bacterial populations.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that RAS ozonation is not a main
   environmental factor structuring the community composition. Instead, the
   parallel drifts and slight convergence of the two community structures
   indicate that other environmental factors such as influent wastewater
   composition and temperature may be more important. Care should be
   exercised in interpreting the proportion of sequence reads as
   pyrosequencing may be biased as compared to FISH.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study provides new insights
   on the importance of indiscriminate high mortality rates brought by
   external factors (here ozonation) on microbial community structures of
   activated sludge system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces clockless stochastic decoding for high-throughput
   low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders. Stochastic computation
   provides ultra-low-complexity hardware using simple logic gates.
   Clockless decoding eliminates global clocking, which eases the
   worst-case timing restrictions of synchronous stochastic decoders. The
   lack of synchronization might use outdated bits to update outputs in
   computation nodes; however, it does not significantly affect output
   probabilities. A timing model of clockless-computation behaviours under
   a 90 nm CMOS technology is used to simulate the BER performance of the
   proposed decoding scheme. Based on our models, the proposed decoding
   scheme significantly reduces error floors due to the ``lock-up{''}
   problem and achieves superior BER performance compared with conventional
   synchronous stochastic decoders. The timing model includes metastability
   to verify the affect on BER performance.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative neutron imaging is a promising technique to investigate
   leaf water flow and transpiration in real time and has perspectives
   towards studies of plant response to environmental conditions and plant
   water stress.
   The leaf hydraulic architecture is a key determinant of plant sap
   transport and plant-atmosphere exchange processes. Non-destructive
   imaging with neutrons shows large potential for unveiling the complex
   internal features of the venation network and the transport therein.
   However, it was only used for two-dimensional imaging without addressing
   flow dynamics and was still unsuccessful in accurate quantification of
   the amount of water. Quantitative neutron imaging was used to
   investigate, for the first time, the water distribution in veins and
   lamina, the three-dimensional venation architecture and sap flow
   dynamics in leaves. The latter was visualised using D2O as a contrast
   liquid. A high dynamic resolution was obtained by using cold neutrons
   and imaging relied on radiography (2D) as well as tomography (3D). The
   principle of the technique was shown for detached leaves, but can be
   applied to in vivo leaves as well. The venation network architecture and
   the water distribution in the veins and lamina unveiled clear
   differences between plant species. The leaf water content could be
   successfully quantified, though still included the contribution of the
   leaf dry matter. The flow measurements exposed the hierarchical
   structure of the water transport pathways, and an accurate
   quantification of the absolute amount of water uptake in the leaf was
   possible. Particular advantages of neutron imaging, as compared to X-ray
   imaging, were identified. Quantitative neutron imaging is a promising
   technique to investigate leaf water flow and transpiration in real time
   and has perspectives towards studies of plant response to environmental
   conditions and plant water stress.}},

Abstract = {{The response of bacteria to hyperbaric pressure treatment was
   investigated. Three selected bacteria which cause fruit and vegetable
   decay (i.e., Pseudomonas cichorii, Pectobacterium carotovorum, and
   Pseudomonas marginalis) were inoculated onto BIOLOG microplates and
   subjected to different pressure and temperature conditions including
   100, 200, 400, 625, and 850 kPa at 20 A degrees C and 100 kPa at 4 A
   degrees C. Changes in microplate color, which corresponds to carbon
   source utilization of bacteria or their growth, were monitored every 24
   h for 7 days. Results showed that the bacterial growth was affected by
   both hyperbaric pressure and temperature. As hyperbaric pressure
   increased, the bacterial growth significantly decreased and the extent
   was dependent on bacterial species. The 850-kPa pressure treatment
   reduced maximum growth by 71, 56, and 43 \% for Pseudomonas cichorii,
   Pectobacterium carotovorum, and Pseudomonas marginalis, respectively.
   Among these bacteria, Pseudomonas cichorii was the most
   pressure-sensitive, while the most temperature-sensitive was
   Pectobacterium carotovorum. In general, an increase in hyperbaric
   pressure caused bacteria to utilize carbon sources similar to those when
   they were exposed to low temperature. Overall, hyperbaric treatment has
   the potential to directly reduce bacterial growth in fruit and
   vegetables after harvest.}},

Abstract = {{In previous studies, 3D motion of the middle-ear ossicles in cat and
   human was explored, but models for hearing research have shifted in the
   last few decades to smaller mammals, and gerbil, in particular, has
   become a popular hearing model. In the present study, we have measured
   with an optical interferometer the 3D motion of the malleus and incus in
   anesthetized gerbil for sound of moderate intensity (90-dB sound
   pressure level) over a broad frequency range. To access the ossicles,
   the pars flaccida was removed exposing the neck and head of the malleus
   and the incus from the malleus-incus joint to the plate of the
   lenticular process. Vibration measurements were done at six to eight
   points per ossicle while the angle of observation was varied over
   approximately 30 A degrees to enable calculation of the 3D rigid-body
   velocity components. These components were expressed in an intrinsic
   reference frame, with one axis along the anatomical suspension axis of
   the malleus-incus block and a second axis along the stapes piston
   direction. Another way of describing the motion that does not assume an
   a priori rotation axis is to calculate the instantaneous rotation axis
   (screw axis) of the malleus/incus motion. Only at frequencies below a
   few kilohertz did the screw axis have a maximum rotation in a direction
   close to that of the ligament axis. A slight slippage in the
   malleus-incus joint developed with increasing frequency. Our findings
   are useful in determining the sound transfer characteristics through the
   middle ear and serve as a reference for validation of mathematical
   middle-ear models. Last but not least, comparing our present results in
   gerbil with those of previously measured species (human and cat) exposes
   similarities and dissimilarities among them.}},

Abstract = {{Oral mucositis (ulcer) is a serious and painful side effect for patients
   with head and neck cancer following radiation therapy. However, current
   clinical strategies cannot efficiently prevent the occurrence of oral
   mucositis. In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow-derived
   cells (BMDCs) prevented the occurrence and/or decreased the severity of
   radiation-induced oral mucositis. Fresh concentrated BMDCs from male C3H
   mice were transplanted intravenously into female mice after tongue
   irradiation. For 14 days postirradiation, the changes of body weight and
   the time courses of ulceration were observed. Until the ulcer reached
   maximum size (7 days postirradiation), macroscopic and histologic
   analyses of harvested tongues were performed to detect the behavior of
   donor BMDCs. Between 2 and 5 days postirradiation, BMDCs-transplanted
   mice showed more expression of stem cell markers (c-Kit, Sca-1) and EGFR
   and fewer apoptotic cells when compared with nontransplanted control
   mice (irradiation group). On day 7, there were fewer and smaller ulcers
   observed in the BMDCs-transplanted group. Tongues of these mice had
   preserved their epithelial thickness, and regenerative activities (blood
   vessels formation, cell proliferation) were higher than they were in the
   irradiation group. Fluorescently labeled BMDCs were not detected in
   tongue epithelium but rather in connective tissue (dermis) just below
   the basal cell layer. These findings suggest that exogenous BMDCs behave
   to reduce radiogenic oral mucositis in a paracrine manner.}},

Abstract = {{Wafer bonding using an intermediate layer such as SiO2 is now a standard
   method for the fabrication of engineered substrates in the semiconductor
   industry, the prime example being silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates.
   However, direct semiconductor-to-semiconductor bonding by this method
   has been less successful, since the surfaces to be bonded are typically
   exposed to air. With the in-place bonding method,
   semiconductor-to-semiconductor bonding occurs during removal of a
   sacrificial layer in an HF solution, in principle allowing for a bonded
   interface that is free of oxygen and other airborn contaminants. We have
   investigated the interface properties of in-place bonded GaAs/GaAs
   structures with both transmission electron microscopy and
   current-voltage measurements. The interface was found to be free of an
   oxide interlayer and microstructure imperfections. The specific
   electrical resistance is (2.2 +/- 0.5) x 10(-4) Omega cm(2), an order of
   magnitude lower than values reported for wafer bonded interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Airway tracts serve as a conduit of transport in the respiratory system.
   Architecturally, these are composed of cartilage rings that offer
   flexibility and prevent collapse during normal breathing. To this end,
   the successful regeneration of an airway tract requires the presence of
   differentiated chondrocytes and airway smooth muscle cells. This study
   investigated the role of physiological dynamic mechanical stimulation,
   in vitro, on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
   three-dimensionally seeded within a tubular dense collagen matrix
   construct-reinforced with rings of electrospun silk fibroin mat
   (TDC-SFC). In particular, the role of either shear stress supplied by
   laminar fluid flow or cyclic shear stress in combination with
   circumferential strain, provided by pulsatile flow, on the chondrogenic
   differentiation, and contractile lineage of MSCs, and their effects on
   TDC-SFC morphology and mechanical properties were analysed. Chondrogenic
   differentiation of MSCs was observed in the presence of chondrogenic
   supplements under both static and laminar flow cultures. In contrast,
   physiological pulsatile flow resulted in preferential cellular
   orientation within TDC-SFC, as dictated by dynamic circumferential
   strain, and induced MSC contractile phenotype expression. In addition,
   pulsatile flow decreased MSC-mediated collagen matrix remodelling and
   increased construct circumferential strength. Therefore, TDC-SFC
   demonstrated the central role of a matrix in the delivery of mechanical
   stimuli over chemical factors, by providing an in vitro niche to control
   MSC differentiation, alignment and its capacity to remodel the matrix.

Abstract = {{Proposed in this paper is a general methodology applicable to the
   synthesis of spherical motion generators in the presence of an
   incomplete set of finitely separated attitudes. The spherical rigid-body
   guidance problem in the realm of four-bar linkage synthesis can be
   solved exactly for up to five prescribed attitudes of the coupler link,
   and hence, any number of attitudes smaller than five is considered
   incomplete in this paper. The attitudes completing the set are
   determined to produce a linkage whose performance is robust against
   variations in the unprescribed attitudes. Robustness is needed in this
   context to overcome the presence of uncertainty due to the selection of
   the unspecified attitudes, that many a time are specified implicitly by
   the designer upon choosing, for example, the location of the fixed
   joints of the dyads. A theoretical framework for model-based robust
   engineering design is thus, recalled, and a methodology for the robust
   synthesis of spherical four-bar linkages is laid down. An example is
   included here to concretize the concepts and illustrate the application
   of the proposed methodology.}},

   foaming tests of the Al-3 wt pct Sn-X alloy were carried out using a

Abstract = {{Correlations between responses in visual cortex and perceptual
   performance help draw a functional link between neural activity and
   visually guided behavior. These correlations are commonly derived with
   ROC-based neural-behavioral covariances (referred to as choice or detect
   probability) using boxcar analysis windows. Although boxcar windows
   capture the covariation between neural activity and behavior during
   steady-state stimulus presentations, they are not optimized to capture
   these correlations during short time-varying visual inputs. In this
   study, we implemented a matched-filter technique, combined with
   cross-validation, to improve the estimation of ROC-based
   neural-behavioral covariance under short and dynamic stimulus
   conditions. We show that this approach maximizes the area under the ROC
   curve and converges to the true neural-behavioral covariance using a
   Poisson spiking model. We also demonstrate that the matched filter,
   combined with cross-validation, reveals the dynamics of the
   neural-behavioral covariations of individual MT neurons during the
   detection of a brief motion stimulus.}},

Title = {{De-aggregated hazard of freezing rain events}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{297-312}},
Month = {{AUG-SEP}},
Abstract = {{The objective of the work presented here is to improve estimates of
   atmospheric icing hazards, specifically for radial ice accumulation on
   electrical transmission lines, by clustering freezing rainstorms into
   different groups and using de-aggregate statistical analysis. In this
   paper, freezing rain storms were clustered based on anomaly maps
   constructed using NCEP reanalysis data of 1000 hPa to 500 hPa
   geopotential heights or SLP. The procedure is demonstrated with data
   from Montreal, as well as a superstation of Montreal, Quebec City, and
   Ottawa together. The physical meaning of the different clusters was also
   analyzed and discussed in terms of wind speed, total precipitation or
   ice accumulation, air mass positions, and compared with Rauber's
   archetypical patterns.
   The results presented indicate that the clusters have statistical and
   physical significance. Clustering based on either SLP or 1000 hPa to 500
   hPa height anomalies produces clusters with different precipitation
   characteristics which can be explained on a physical basis. Clustering
   Montreal storms based on 1000 hPa to 500 hPa height anomalies produced
   one cluster containing the five worst ice storms that occurred in
   Montreal during that time period. This cluster was characterized by an
   expansive zone of 1000 hPa to 500 hPa height positive anomalies over
   Montreal that extend far north. It also shows significant SLP anomalies
   and cold air damming.
   The de-aggregated hazard analysis is able to demonstrate that the
   relative contribution of each cluster changes for more extreme events.
   The de-aggregated analysis produces optimal statistical fits for
   clusters and introduces robustness in the estimation of the return
   period over a range threshold. Finally, a small bias is suggested in the
   single population analysis where the return periods are consistently
   lower over a range of quantiles and thresholds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Natural and man-made structural materials perform similar functions such
   as structural support or protection. Therefore they rely on the same
   types of properties: strength, robustness, lightweight. Nature can
   therefore provide a significant source of inspiration for new and
   alternative engineering designs. We report here some results regarding a
   very common, yet largely unknown, type of biological material: fish
   skin. Within a thin, flexible and lightweight layer, fish skins display
   a variety of strain stiffening and stabilizing mechanisms which promote
   multiple functions such as protection, robustness and swimming
   efficiency. We particularly discuss four important features pertaining
   to scaled skins: (a) a strongly elastic tensile behavior that is
   independent from the presence of rigid scales, (b) a compressive
   response that prevents buckling and wrinkling instabilities, which are
   usually predominant for thin membranes, (c) a bending response that
   displays nonlinear stiffening mechanisms arising from geometric
   constraints between neighboring scales and (d) a robust structure that
   preserves the above characteristics upon the loss or damage of
   structural elements. These important properties make fish skin an
   attractive model for the development of very thin and flexible armors
   and protective layers, especially when combined with the high
   penetration resistance of individual scales. Scaled structures inspired
   by fish skin could find applications in ultra-light and flexible armor
   systems, flexible electronics or the design of smart and adaptive
   morphing structures for aerospace vehicles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Predicting intramuscular fat content of pork using hyperspectral imaging}},

Volume = {{134}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is an important quality trait of pork.
   It influences taste, juiciness and tenderness of the meat. The aim of
   this study was to develop an objective, rapid, and non-destructive
   method for predicting the IMF content of pork using hyperspectral
   imaging technology. Critical wavelengths were selected using correlation
   analysis based on the spectral profiles of pork samples. The visual IMF
   flecks on both sides of pork chops were extracted using the wide line
   detector at the selected critical wavelengths. The proportion of IMF
   fleck areas (PFA) at critical wavelengths was used for modeling to
   predict the IMF content of pork. Both stepwise procedures and partial
   least squares (PLS) analysis were employed to establish the prediction
   models. Three different multilinear models were obtained using the
   stepwise procedure with different first entry variable of the initial
   model. A 3-component PLS model was developed for prediction of the IMF
   content. The PLS model outperformed the three multilinear models. The
   coefficients of determination (R-2) of the PLS model on the calibration
   set and validation set were 0.94 and 0.97, respectively, and the
   adjusted R-2 were 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. The prediction results of
   mutilinear models and PLS models indicated the potentials of using
   hyperspectral imaging to predict the IMF content of pork. (C) 2014

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{656-667}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We present a theoretical framework to study the thermal responses of
   one-dimensional multilayered systems, functionally graded solid media,
   and porous materials. The method for thermal analysis resorts to
   non-Fourier heat conduction theories including three-phase-lag,
   dual-phase-lag, and hyperbolic heat conduction. The graded media are
   modeled as multilayered systems displaying finite numbers of layers. For
   each homogenous layer, the differential equations of heat conduction
   describing the wave-like three-phase-lag are solved in closed-form in
   the Laplace domain. Solutions accounting for proper interfacial and
   boundary conditions are first presented to describe the thermal behavior
   of heterogeneous solids and porous media. Transient temperature and heat
   flux are obtained in time domain via fast Laplace inversion. We then
   apply the solutions obtained with each heat conduction theory to
   one-dimensional media and compare their thermal behavior. Finally, maps
   are presented to visualize the thermal responses of cellular materials,
   functionally graded cellular materials, and multilayered systems. For
   the latter, particular attention is devoted to investigate the impact of
   key attributes defining graded media, such as layer bond imperfections
   and material heterogeneity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tooth enamel is a very brittle material; however it has the ability to
   sustain cracks without suffering catastrophic failure throughout the
   lifetime of mechanical function. We propose that the nanostructure of
   enamel can play a significant role in defining its unique mechanical
   properties. Accordingly we analyzed the nanostructure and chemical
   composition of a group of teeth, and correlated it with the crack
   resistance of the same teeth. Here we show how the dimensions of apatite
   nanocrystals in enamel can affect its resistance to crack propagation.
   We conclude that the aspect ratio of apatite nanocrystals in enamel
   determines its resistance to crack propagation. According to this
   finding, we proposed a new model based on the Hall-Petch theory that
   accurately predicts crack propagation in enamel. Our new biomechanical
   model of enamel is the first model that can successfully explain the
   observed variations in the behavior of crack propagation of tooth enamel
   among different humans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cartilage has a limited capacity for self-repair and focal damage can
   eventually lead to complete degradation of the tissue. Early diagnosis
   of degenerative changes in cartilage is therefore essential. Contrast
   agent-based computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide
   promising tools for this purpose. However, the common assumption in
   clinical applications that contrast agents reach steady-state
   distributions within the tissue has been of questionable validity.
   Characterization of nonequilibrium diffusion of contrast agents rather
   than their equilibrium distributions may therefore be more effective for
   image-based cartilage assessment. Transport of contrast agent through
   the extracellular matrix of cartilage can be affected by tissue
   compression due to matrix structural and compositional changes including
   reduced pore size and fluid content. We therefore investigate the
   effects of static compression on diffusion of three common contrast
   agents: sodium iodide, sodium diatrizoate, and gadolinium
   diethylenetriamine-pentaacid (Gd-DTPA). Results showed that static
   compression was associated with significant decreases in diffusivities
   for sodium iodide and Gd-DTPA, with similar (but not significant) trends
   for sodium diatrizoate. Molecular mass of contrast agents affected
   diffusivities as the smallest one tested, sodium iodide, showed higher
   diffusivity than sodium diatrizoate and Gd-DTPA. Compression-associated
   cartilage matrix alterations such as glycosaminoglycan and fluid
   contents were found to correspond with variations in contrast agent
   diffusivities. Although decreased diffusivity was significantly
   correlated with increasing glycosaminoglycan content for sodium iodide
   and Gd-DTPA only, diffusivity significantly increased for all contrast
   agents by increasing fluid fraction. Because compounds based on iodine
   and gadolinium are commonly used for computed tomography and magnetic
   resonance imaging, present findings can be valuable for more accurate
   image-based assessment of variations in cartilage composition associated
   with focal injuries.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses methane dispersion in a mine tunnel with discrete
   methane sources and various methods to handle it. Air flow behavior and
   methane dispersion in the tunnel are simulated utilizing the
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. Various possible conditions
   which may occur in a mine tunnel are investigated. Simulation results
   indicate that methane dispersion inside the mine tunnel is influenced
   significantly by the number as well as location of the sources and
   quantity of methane released from each source. Furthermore, application
   of an innovative flow divider which comprises volumetric flow control
   and flow director, is investigated. It is found that by properly
   directing the ventilation flow to the location where methane is
   accumulating can reduce methane concentration below the safe level. In
   addition, it is noted that focusing the ventilation flow at a point is
   more effective as compared to dispersing it at several points. This
   study provides some new ideas for designing an ``intelligent{''}
   underground mine ventilation system which can cost-effectively maintain
   methane concentration below the critical value. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Sewage-based epidemiology was applied for the first time to a number of
   mainland Chinese megacities. The application monitored influents to 9
   sewage treatment plants (STPs) to estimate the use of illicit drugs in
   Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai. Altogether, 11.4 million
   inhabitants were covered during September-October 2012.24-h composite
   raw sewage samples were collected for 4 consecutive days at each STP.
   Each collected sample was analyzed for cocaine, benzoylecgonine,
   ecgonine methylester, methadone,
   2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethy1-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine, 6-monoacetylmorphine,
   amphetamine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, mephedrone,
   methylenedioxypyrovalerone,
   11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, ketamine, and
   norketamine. Through the analysis of these chemical residues, the use of
   amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, mephedrone, methadone,
   methamphetamine, methylenedioxypyrovalerone and ketamine among Chinese
   urban inhabitants was monitored. The results obtained demonstrated in a
   quantitative way that the drug use patterns of Chinese are different
   from their European counterparts. Abuse of methamphetamine and ketamine
   was particularly noteworthy in China, while consumption of cocaine and
   ecstasy, the most popular drugs in Europe, was very low among the
   sampled Chinese inhabitants. Further, the use of most drugs demonstrated
   a geographical trend, since their use was much higher in the southern
   cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou than it was in Beijing and Shanghai.
   Interestingly, the exclusive, but minor, metabolite of heroin,
   6-monoacetylmorphine, was detected only sporadically. This would suggest
   that the use of heroin among Chinese urban users sampled in the study
   was low. Further, the patterns of drug use observed during the study are
   largely consistent with trends reported by the United Nations Office on
   Drugs and Crime. Overall, our study suggests that sewage-based
   epidemiology can readily be used to monitor the use of illicit drugs in
   those countries/regions where traditional means to monitor drug use
   patterns have only yielded limited or information of questionable
   reliability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several drugs of abuse, including amphetamines, cocaine and its
   metabolite, benzoylecgonine and several opioid prescription drugs were
   detected in wastewater from two Canadian cities, a small community
   (75,000 population) and a large urban center (1.6 million population).
   The objective of this study was to evaluate community use of these drugs
   in two cities with large differences in population size and
   demographics. In addition, we evaluated the use of the Polar Organic
   Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) as a monitoring tool for drugs of
   abuse. Heroin was not detected at either location, probably because this
   illicit drug is metabolized to morphine prior to excretion.
   Acetylcodeine and acetylmorphine were also not detected. Estimates of
   community consumption from wastewater analysis indicated that the most
   widely used drug was cocaine at a median level of consumption in the
   larger city of approximately 38 doses per day per 1000 people.
   Consumption of the substituted amphetamine, ephedrine, as well as
   methamphetamine was also higher in the larger city, at 21 and 1.8 doses
   per day per 1000 people, respectively. Use of amphetamine, MDMA and
   tramadol were similar in both centers, but use of oxycodone was greater
   in the smaller city. Use of MDMA (ecstasy) peaked on weekends. Ketamine
   was detected in wastewater from the larger city; the first report of
   abuse of this veterinary anesthetic in a North American city. POCIS
   sampling rates were determined for the first time for 7 of the target
   compounds. Comparing the time weighted average concentrations estimated
   from POCIS data to the concentrations obtained from 24-h composite
   samples, the data were generally comparable, except for some compounds
   which were not detected in POCIS deployed in the untreated wastewater,
   probably because of biofouling or accumulation of debris on the cages
   containing the POCIS. This study indicates that the size and
   demographics of population centers can influence the patterns of abuse
   of drugs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the levels of 19 drugs of abuse were estimated throughout
   a wastewater treatment plant using polar organic chemical integrative
   samplers (POCIS), 24 h composite samples and grab samples. Overall
   removal efficiencies and removals in between each treatment unit were
   calculated using load data for each sampling technique as well as
   removals that take into account the hydraulic residence time
   distribution of the treatment plant (time-shifted mass balancing
   approach). Amphetamine-type stimulants, cocaine and its major
   metabolite, benzoylecgonine and opioid levels determined with 24 h
   composite samples were generally comparable to those obtained with POCIS
   and grab samples. Negative mass balances resulting from the estimation
   of overall removal efficiencies by POCIS, day-to-day mass balancing of
   24 h composite and grab sample data did not occur when the hydraulic
   retention time (HRT) distributions of the plant were taken into account
   for calculation. Among the compounds investigated, cocaine exhibited the
   highest overall removal (90\%) while codeine had the lowest with 13\%,
   respectively. Sampling between the treatment units revealed that highest
   removal occurs during biological treatment as compared to primary or
   secondary clarification. Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), fentanyl,
   dihydrocodeine and heroin were not detected in wastewater at any of the
   sampling locations at the treatment plant regardless of the sampling

Abstract = {{In this study amphetamine, methamphetamine,
   methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), cocaine (COC), benzoylecgonine
   (BE), ketamine (MET) and oxycodone (OXY) in wastewater at concentrations
   of 100 mu gL(-1) were subjected to ozone to determine their removals as
   a function of ozone dose and to identify significant oxidation
   transformation products (OTPs) produced as a result of ozonation. A
   method based on high resolution mass spectrometry and differential
   analysis was used to facilitate and accelerate the identification and
   structural elucidation of the transformation products. The drug removal
   ranged from 3 to 50\% depending on the complexity of the matrix and
   whether a mixture or individual drugs were ozonated. Both transient and
   persistent oxidation transformation products were identified for MDMA,
   COC and OXY and their chemical formulae were determined. Three possible
   structures of the persistent transformation product of MDMA (OTP-213)
   with chemical formula C10H16O4N, were determined based on MSn mass
   spectra and the most plausible structure (OTP-213a) was determined based
   on the chemistry of ozone. These results indicate that ozone is capable

Abstract = {{Steam gasification experiments of ash-free coal with and without
   potassium carbonate were performed in a newly designed drop-down
   reactor. The temperature dependency on the carbon conversion and gas
   production rates was investigated in a range of 600-800 degrees C and
   2.5 bar. The gasification rate at 700 degrees C was approximately 20
   times faster in the presence of the potassium catalysts. The
   gasification temperature could be lowered by similar to 125 degrees C.
   For example, at 625 degrees C the catalyzed gasification rate was
   essentially the same as for uncatalyzed rate at 750 degrees C. In
   addition, the catalyst reduced the apparent activation energy from 268
   to 161 kJ mol(-1). The water-gas-shift reaction was in equilibrium for
   both the uncatalyzed and catalyzed gasification of the ash-free coal
   samples. At low temperatures, a considerable amount of methane was
   formed through direct hydrogenation of the carbon substrate. Methane
   formation was decoupled from the COx production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Cast films based on polypropylene (PP) blended with commercial maleic
   anhydride or acrylic acid grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MA and PP-g-MA) at
   different weight ratios were prepared by melt extrusion. These films
   were used to produce hydrophilic microporous membranes. The membranes
   were prepared by annealing at elevated temperatures followed by cold and
   hot stretching, respectively. DSC, FTIR and SAXS analyses showed that
   the addition of the modifiers changed the crystalline lamellar structure
   and, consequently, the membrane morphology. Membrane morphology
   observations using SEM showed smaller pore size and lower number of
   pores as the modifier content increased. Porosity and pore dimensions of
   the microporous membranes were also measured using mercury porosimetry
   and their results confirmed SEM observations. Oxygen content of the
   precursor film surface was analyzed using XPS. Water vapor permeability
   was increased significantly at low concentrations of the modifiers,
   compared to the neat PP. This was attributed to the presence of
   sufficient concentration of polar groups on the surface with a minimal
   change in the crystalline structure. Finally, the tensile properties of
   the precursor films in the machine directions (MD) as well as the
   puncture resistance of the precursors and the membranes in the normal
   direction (ND) were evaluated. (C) 2014 Elsevier BY. All rights

Abstract = {{LiCoO2 cathode material synthesized by a sol-gel method is modified by
   different contents of MgF2 via simple chemical deposition. The structure
   and morphology of pristine and MgF2-coated LiCoO2 are investigated by
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy
   (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). It
   is found that the homogeneous MgF2 surface modification does not change
   the bulk structure of LiCoO2. The effects of MgF2 on the electrochemical
   behaviors of LiCoO2 are studied. Comparatively, 1 wt.\% MgF2-coated
   LiCoO2 exhibits the best electrochemical performances. Cyclic
   voltammetry (CV) results confirm that MgF2 surface coating decreases the
   electrode polarization and improves the structural stability of LiCoO2
   during cycling. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) for pristine and 1 wt.\%
   MgF2-coated LiCoO2 further demonstrates that modification layer
   suppresses the undesirable growth of solid electrolyte interface (SEI)
   film, which greatly contributes to the improved electrochemical
   performances after surface modification. Differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) tests show that MgF2 coating also improves the thermal
   stability of LiCoO2 electrode. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Surface Modification of Poly(D,L-Lactic Acid) Scaffolds for Orthopedic
   Applications: A Biocompatible, Nondestructive Route via Diazonium
   Chemistry}},
Journal = {{ACS APPLIED MATERIALS \& INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{9975-9987}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{Scaffolds made with synthetic polymers such as polyesters are commonly
   used in bone tissue engineering. However, their hydrophobicity and the
   lack of specific functionalities make their surface not ideal for cell
   adhesion and growth. Surface modification of these materials is thus
   crucial to enhance the scaffold's integration in the body. Different
   surface modification techniques have been developed to improve scaffold
   biocompatibility. Here we show that diazonium chemistry can be used to
   modify the outer and inner surfaces of three-dimensional poly(D,L-lactic
   acid) (PDLLA) scaffolds with phosphonate groups, using a simple two-step
   method. By changing reaction time and impregnation procedure, we were
   able to tune the concentration of phosphonate groups present on the
   scaffolds, without degrading the PDLLA matrix. To test the effectiveness
   of this modification, we immersed the scaffolds in simulated body fluid,
   and characterized them with scanning electron microscopy, Xray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman, and infrared spectroscopy. Our
   results showed that a layer of hydroxyapatite particles was formed on
   all scaffolds after 2 and 4 weeks of immersion; however, the
   precipitation was faster and in larger amounts on the
   phosphonate-modified than on the bare PDLLA scaffolds. Both osteogenic
   MC3T3-E1 and chondrogenic ATDC5 cell lines showed increased cell
   viability/metabolic activity when grown on a phosphonated PDLLA surface
   in comparison to a control PDLLA surface. Also, more calcium-containing
   minerals were deposited by cultures grown on phosphonated PDLLA, thus
   showing the pro-mineralization properties of the proposed modification.
   This work introduces diazonium chemistry as a simple and biocompatible
   technique to modify scaffold surfaces, allowing to covalently and
   homogeneously bind a number of functional groups without degrading the
   scaffold's polymeric matrix.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{A variety of observations-sometimes controversial-have been made in
   recent decades when attempting to elucidate the roles of interfacial
   slip on tracer diffusion in phospholipid membranes. Evans-Sackmann
   theory (1988) has furnished membrane viscosities and lubrication-film
   thicknesses for supported membranes from experimentally measured lateral
   diffusion coefficients. Similar to the Saffman and Delbruck model, which
   is the well-known counterpart for freely supported membranes, the
   bilayer is modelled as a single two-dimensional fluid. However, the
   Evans-Sackman model cannot interpret the mobilities of monotopic
   tracers, such as individual lipids or rigidly bound lipid assemblies;
   neither does it account for tracer-leaflet and inter-leaflet slip. To
   address these limitations, we solve the model of Wang and Hill, in which
   two leaflets of a bilayer membrane, a circular tracer and supports are
   coupled by interfacial friction, using phenomenological friction/slip
   coefficients. This furnishes an exact solution that can be readily
   adopted to interpret the mobilities of a variety of mosaic
   elements-including lipids, integral monotopic and polytopic proteins,
   and lipid rafts-in supported bilayer membranes.}},

Abstract = {{KitW-sh mice carry an inactivating mutation in the gene encoding the
   receptor for stem cell factor, which is expressed at high levels on the
   surface of haematopoietic precursor cells. The mutation results in mast
   cell deficiency, a variety of defects in innate immunity and poorly
   defined abnormalities in bone. The present study was designed to
   characterise healing of a cortical window defect in skeletally mature
   KitW-sh mice using high-resolution micro computed tomographic imaging
   and histological analyses. The cortical bone defect healed completely in
   all wild type mice but failed to heal in about half of the KitW-sh mice
   by 12 weeks post-operative. Defective healing was associated with
   premature and excessive expression of TRAP positive cells embedded in
   fibrous marrow but with little change in ALP activity.
   Immuno-histochemical analyses revealed reduced CD34 positive vascular
   endothelial cells and F4/80 positive macrophages at 1 and 2 weeks
   post-operative. Impaired bone healing in the KitW-sh mice was therefore
   attributed to altered catabolic activity, impaired re-vascularisation
   and compromised replacement of woven with compact bone.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive water resources management recognizes the centrality of
   learning to its effective implementation. However, the literature on
   learning in Adaptive Management (AM) is disjointed and lacks rigorous
   treatment. The purpose of this paper is to clarify how learning
   associated with AM is distinctive and to explain the importance of
   successfully integrating it into policy design. Because adaptive
   learning holds a unique position within the adaptive management and
   assessment process, it should serve as the basis for a systematic
   redesign of water policy processes. Adaptive environmental assessment
   and management processes, which highlight the role of adaptive learning,
   are built upon in this paper. For the purpose of this paper, adaptive
   learning is defined as ``an ongoing process of inquiry that incorporates
   new knowledge with the aim to continually improve management
   policies{''}. In order for adaptive learning to live with and profit
   from nature's dynamism, it is argued that it must be problem-centered,
   decision relevant, reflective, and inherently transformative. When this
   kind of learning becomes a fully integrated component of AM, water
   resource institutions have a greater likelihood of maturing into actual
   ``learning systems{''}. The specific objectives of this paper are to: 1)
   redefine what adaptive learning is, 2) explain how this particular type
   of learning is distinctive and 3) outline the role of adaptive learning
   in policy formation. Regarding policy design, the paramount issue is
   determining how to respond to the speed, scale, and complexity of the
   planetary challenges. This paper draws on a number of related areas of
   research to present propositions for increasing the adaptive capacity of
   water organizations. These research topics include: demonstrating how
   adaptive learning should be integrated into policy design; establishing
   new standards of practice that are based on adaptive learning rather
   than achieving `optimal' end-game solutions; using the breakthrough
   views in order to transform learning into effective action; framing
   management problems in non-reductionist ways so that nature may serve as
   an ally and pilot; using shadow networks to inspire innovation,
   encourage institutional learning, and improve governance rules; and
   creating a new social reality that is more future-responsive to problems

Abstract = {{Urban growth is increasing the demand for freshwater resources, yet
   surprisingly the water sources of the world's large cities have never
   been globally assessed, hampering efforts to assess the distribution and
   causes of urban water stress. We conducted the first global survey of
   the large cities' water sources, and show that previous global
   hydrologic models that ignored urban water infrastructure significantly
   overestimated urban water stress. Large cities obtain 78 +/- 3\% of
   their water from surface sources, some of which are far away:
   cumulatively, large cities moved 504 billion liters a day (184 km(3)
   yr(-1)) a distance of 27,000 +/- 3800 km, and the upstream contributing
   area of urban water sources is 41\% of the global land surface. Despite
   this infrastructure, one in four cities, containing \$4.8 +/- 0.7
   trillion in economic activity, remain water stressed due to geographical
   and financial limitations. The strategic management of these cities'
   water sources is therefore important for the future of the global
   economy. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Modeling weather and stocking rate effects on forage and steer
   production in northern mixed-grass prairie}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{103-114}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Stocking rate (SR) is the primary management factor that influences
   livestock gains, plant community changes and forage production, as well
   as economic returns for livestock producers. More effective stocking
   decision making by ranchers in the semi-arid northern mixed-grass
   prairie requires clearly understanding forage production and yearling
   steer weight gain (SWG) responses to SR and high weather variability.
   The objectives of this study were to: (1) test the Great Plains
   Framework for Agricultural Resource Management-Range (GPFARM-Range)
   model for predicting forage production and SWG under three experimental
   SR treatments and long-term weather conditions on semiarid northern
   mixed-grass prairie in southeast Wyoming, USA; and (2) quantify the
   threshold responses of forage production and SWG to SR and the yearly
   weather variability across years using long-term simulations with SR
   higher than those experimentally evaluated. We improved upon the
   GPFARM-Range model to simulate peak standing crop (PSC) and SWG for
   three experimental SR treatments (low, moderate and high; 0.20, 0.33 and
   0.44 steer ha(-1), respectively) from 1982 to 2012 at Cheyenne, Wyoming,
   USA. The improved model accurately predicted the effects of SR on PSC
   and SWG across years (root mean square errors from 355 to 387 kg ha(-1)
   for PSC and from 12.8 to 14.2 kg head(-1) for SWG). We ran the model
   with long-term weather data and 50-300\% higher SR (0.66-1.76 steer
   ha(-1)) than the high SR experimental treatment. Differential responses
   of predicted total intake of digestible nutrients (quadratic increase)
   and metabolic maintenance (linear increase) to these higher SR resulted
   in a quadratic increase of predicted SWG with SR and high yearly
   variability at high SR levels. The financially-optimum SR with highest
   profits was reduced to 0.33 steer ha(-1) for dry or normal seasons and
   0.44 steer ha(-1) for wet seasons. Such reduced SR can also benefit land
   conservation with high PSC and low harvest efficiency. The moderate SR
   with 25\% harvest efficiency was determined between 0.22 and 0.33 steer
   ha(-1) for dry or normal seasons, or between 0.33 and 0.44 steer ha(-1)
   for wet seasons. These results provide useful direction for selecting an
   effective SR to achieve high economic net return with lower yearly
   variability (risk) and reduced likelihood of rangeland degradation. (C)

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{21-27}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{After soybeans, canola is the second most important oilseed crop in
   Canada, with more than 99\% of the canola cultivation consisting of
   herbicide resistant (HR) varieties. The expansion in HR canola
   cultivation has led to the increasing use of the same herbicides for
   weed control which has resulted in a growing concern about their impact
   on the environment. The present study was conducted to investigate the
   dissipation and transport of the herbicides, glyphosate and glufosinate,
   in soil used for the transgenic production of canola and a comparison
   was made with the herbicide, trifluralin, used in non-transgenic canola.
   Commercially grown HR transgenic canola varieties and a conventional
   canola variety were planted in a randomized complete block design. The
   plots planted with Roundup Ready and Liberty Link cultivars were treated
   with glyphosate and glufosinate, respectively, at the 2-3 leaf stage and
   at the rosette stage in each replication. On conventional canola plots,
   trifluralin was incorporated into soil a day before planting. Soil
   samples were collected from two depths, 0-0.15 m and 0.15-0.30 m, at
   different time intervals (1, 7 and 20 days) after the application of the
   herbicide. Analysis of the soil samples was done by HPLC (high
   performance liquid chromatography) to determine the residual amounts of
   herbicide in the soil. Glufosinate was found to be the least persistent
   herbicide, while trifluralin persisted the longest. The overall order of
   persistence was Trifluralin > Glyphosate > Glufosinate. Trifluralin was
   found at lower depths (0.15-030 cm) at 7 and 20 days after the herbicide
   application, with higher residual concentrations than the other
   herbicides used in the HR canola. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{The fabrication of cell-laden structures with anisotropic mechanical
   properties while having a precise control over the distribution of
   different cell types within the constructs is important for many tissue
   engineering applications. Automated textile technologies for making
   fabrics allow simultaneous control over the color pattern and
   directional mechanical properties. The use of textile techniques in
   tissue engineering, however, demands the presence of cell-laden fibers
   that can withstand the mechanical stresses during the assembly process.
   Here, the concept of composite living fibers (CLFs) in which a core of
   load bearing synthetic polymer is coated by a hydrogel layer containing
   cells or microparticles is introduced. The core thread is drawn
   sequentially through reservoirs containing a cell-laden prepolymer and a
   crosslinking reagent. The thickness of the hydrogel layer increases
   linearly with to the drawing speed and the prepolymer viscosity. CLFs
   are fabricated and assembled using regular textile processes including
   weaving, knitting, braiding, winding, and embroidering, to form
   cell-laden structures. Cellular viability and metabolic activity are
   preserved during CLF fabrication and assembly, demonstrating the
   feasibility of using these processes for engineering functional 3D
   tissue constructs.}},

Abstract = {{A general overview of the seismic performance of representative
   single-storey concentrically braced frame (CBF) buildings designed using
   the 1965 National Building Code of Canada and the 1965 S16 Canadian
   Standards Association Steel Structures for Buildings Standard was
   obtained through the use of nonlinear time history dynamic analyses and
   the testing of brace elements obtained from buildings constructed in the
   1960s. The study comprised 16 representative buildings subjected to 20
   site selected ground motions for three locations; Halifax (Nova Scotia)
   low seismicity, Montreal (Quebec) moderate seismicity, and Abbotsford
   (British Columbia) high seismicity. Incremental dynamic analyses were
   performed using various failure criteria as obtained from the test data;
   brace net-section fracture, bolt shear, block shear, bolt bearing and
   brace yielding. Fragility curves were created and the probability of
   failure was defined. The performance of the structures designed for
   Abbotsford was unsatisfactory for all of the brace connection failure
   mechanisms. In contrast, because of the lower current seismic hazard in
   Montreal, the 16 archetypical buildings demonstrated better performance.
   In Halifax the buildings performed well, based on the identified failure
   criteria. It was necessary to strengthen the roof diaphragms for all
   buildings to carry 2010 NBCC design level seismic forces.}},

Abstract = {{The rising use of surface-modified engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) will
   result in their increased presence in aquatic environments; hence, a
   better understanding of their environmental fate is needed. In this
   study, silicon nanocrystals (Si-NCs) capped with organic acids of
   varying alkyl-chain length were used as model functionalized ENPs.
   Particle deposition kinetics were evaluated using sand-packed columns
   and a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D).
   In general, an increase in solution ionic strength resulted in increased
   particle deposition in both columns and the QCM-D. However, the overall
   trends in Si-NC deposition with regard to alkyl-chain length differed in
   the two experimental systems, revealing how the system geometry can play
   a key role in defining the contribution of different particle retention
   mechanisms. To interpret these differences in the Si-NC deposition
   behavior, multiple characterization techniques were used: dynamic light
   scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis, scanning ion occlusion
   sensing, and laser Doppler velocimetry. QCM-D also revealed insights
   into the influence of the particle surface coatings on particle
   stability. The ratio of the two QCM-D output parameters revealed that
   the rigidity of the particle-collector interfacial bonds varied with the
   alkyl-chain length, whereby particles capped with longer alkyl chains
   were less rigidly attached to the silica surface. Moreover, it is shown
   that the interpretation of ENP deposition behavior using QCM-D is
   limited by the presence of large-particle aggregates (>= 700 nm in this
   study) which do not fully couple to the QCM-D sensor. Under such

Abstract = {{Currently, only 10\% of the cultivated lands in Jamaica are irrigated,
   and as a result farmers are highly dependent on seasonal rainfall. For
   this reason, a study was undertaken in order to determine monthly
   irrigation requirements for three study sites, for both vegetables and
   sugarcane. A proper scientific methodology was applied to achieve this
   information on crop water requirements in Jamaica for the first time. In
   addition, the cumulative frequencies of monthly and seasonal rainfall
   depths were analyzed, and this information used to develop monthly
   rainfall values, as well as seasonal rainfall values for different
   return periods for the sites. Each study site was found to be unique in
   its irrigation requirements, which highlights the climatic and soil
   variability across the island. However, all three sites were similar in
   their need for irrigation during the months of March and April for
   vegetables, signifying that this is a universally dry period across the
   island. This information is meant to provide a foundation for irrigation
   planning and water management strategies during water-scarce conditions.

   quantum efficiency can reach 45 and 8.3\% at 83 and 300 K, respectively.
   However, efficiency droop is clearly measured with increasing carrier
   injection due to the unusually large Auger recombination coefficient,
   which is found to be similar to 10(-24) cm(6)/s at room temperature,
   nearly 6 orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional bulk
   semiconductors. The significantly elevated Auger recombination in the
   emerging two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is primarily an indirect
   process and is attributed to the abrupt bounding surfaces and the
   enhanced correlation, mediated by magnified Coulomb interactions,
   between electrons and holes confined in a 2D structure.}},

Abstract = {{Household vehicle ownership, and the associated dimensions including
   fleet size, vehicle type and usage, has been one of the most researched
   transport topics. This paper endeavors to provide a critical overview of
   the wide-ranging methodological approaches employed in vehicle ownership
   modeling depending on the ownership representation over the past two
   decades. The studies in the existing literature based on the vehicle
   ownership representation are classified as: exogenous static, exogenous
   dynamic, endogenous static and endogenous dynamic models. The
   methodological approaches applied range from simple linear regressions
   to complex econometrics formulations taking into account a rich set of
   covariates. In spite of the steady advancement and impressive evolution
   in terms of methodological approaches to examine the decision process,
   we identify complex issues that pose a formidable challenge to address
   the evolution of vehicle ownership in the coming years. Specifically, we
   discuss challenges with data availability and methodological framework
   selection. In light of these discussions, we provide a decision matrix
   for aiding researchers/practitioners in determining appropriate model
   frameworks for conducting vehicle ownership analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Stabilized aluminum flames are studied in the products of methane
   combustion. A premixed methane-air Bunsen flame is seeded with
   increasing concentrations of micron-size aluminum powder, and scanning
   emission spectroscopy is used to determine the flame temperature via
   both the continuous and aluminum monoxide spectra. The flame burning
   velocity is measured and the condensed flame products are collected and
   analyzed for unburned metallic aluminum content. It was observed that,
   below a critical concentration of about 120 g/m(3), aluminum
   demonstrates incomplete oxidation with a flame temperature close to the
   methane-air flame. Below the critical concentration, the flame burning
   velocity also decreases similar to a flame seeded with inert silicon
   carbide particles. In contrast, at aluminum concentrations above the
   critical value, an aluminum flame front rapidly forms and is coupled to
   the methane flame. The flame temperature of the coupled methane-aluminum
   flame is close to equilibrium values with aluminum as a reactant, and
   the flame burning velocity remains flat for increasing aluminum
   concentrations. A simple theoretical estimation, which assumes that the
   aluminum reaction rate is controlled by the kinetic evaporation of
   aluminum, adequately predicts the critical concentration range at which
   the aluminum flame front can be coupled with the methane flame.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{3317-3326}},

Abstract = {{Owing to their adjustable dissolution properties, phosphate-based
   glasses (PGs) are promising materials for the controlled release of
   bioinorganics, such as copper ions. This study describes a vapour
   sorption method that allowed for the investigation of the kinetics and
   mechanisms of aqueous interactions of PGs of the formulation
   50P(2)O(5)-30CaO-(20-x)Na2O-xCuO (x = 0, 1, 5 and 10 mol.\%). Initial
   characterization was performed using P-31 magic angle spinning nuclear
   magnetic resonance and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy. Increasing CuO content resulted in chemical
   shifts of the predominant Q(2) NMR peak and of the (P-O-P)(as) and
   (P-O-) Fourier transform infrared absorptions, owing to the higher
   strength of the P-O-Cu bond compared to P-O-Na. Vapour sorption and
   desorption were gravimetrically measured in PG powders exposed to
   variable relative humidity (RH). Sorption was negligible below 70\% RH
   and increased exponentially with RH from 70 to 90\%, where it exhibited
   a negative correlation with CuO content. Vapour sorption in 0\% and 1\%
   CuO glasses resulted in phosphate chain hydration and hydrolysis, as
   evidenced by protonated Q(0)(1H) and Q(1)(1H) species. Dissolution rates
   in deionized water showed a linear correlation (R-2 > 0.99) with vapour
   sorption. Furthermore, cation release rates could be predicted based on
   dissolution rates and PG composition. The release of orthophosphate and
   short polyphosphate species corroborates the action of hydrolysis and
   was correlated with pH changes. In conclusion, the agreement between
   vapour sorption and routine characterization techniques in water
   demonstrates the potential of this method for the study of PG aqueous
   reactions. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The rheological, thermal and physicochemical properties of animal fat
   wastes (tallow, lard, choice white grease, and yellow grease) are
   important parameters for an efficient design of equipment and to
   optimize the processing procedures of biodiesel production. In this
   study, the physicochemical properties of animal fat waste samples and
   the correlation of these properties to their thermal and rheological
   behaviors were elucidated. Pure lard was equally investigated to monitor
   the effects of impurities on the rheological and thermal properties of
   the animal fat wastes. It was established that the presence of
   impurities had effects on the rheological and thermal properties of
   fats. Additionally, due to the high level of free fatty acid (FFA)
   present in the wastes, transesterification cannot be applied directly.
   It will be necessary to reduce the FFA level by using acid pretreatment
   or enzyme catalyzed transesterification.}},

Abstract = {{Two air atomized aluminum powders, one of commercial purity and the
   other magnesium-doped (0.4 wt\%), were processed by SPS and conventional
   PM means. An investigation of SPS processing parameters and their effect
   on sinter quality were investigated. A comparison with conventionally
   processed PM counterparts was also conducted. Applied pressure and
   ultimate processing temperature bore the greatest influence on
   processing, while heating rate and hold time showed a minor effect. Full
   density specimens were achieved for both powders under select processing
   conditions. To compliment this, large (80 mm) and small (20 mm) diameter
   samples were made to observe possible up-scaling effects, as well as
   tensile properties. Large samples were successfully processed, albeit
   with somewhat inferior densities to the smaller counterparts presumably
   due to the temperature inhomogeneity during processing. An investigation
   of tensile properties for SPS samples exhibited extensive ductility
   (similar to 30\%) at high sintering temperatures, while lower
   temperature SPS samples as well as all PM processed samples exhibited a
   brittle nature. The measurement of residual oxygen and hydrogen contents
   showed a significant elimination of both species in SPS samples under
   certain processing parameters when compared to conventional PM
   equivalents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{34}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Objective-The H2.0-like homeobox transcription factor (HLX) plays an
   essential role in visceral organogenesis in mice and has been shown to
   regulate angiogenic sprouting in vitro and in zebrafish embryos. We
   therefore examined the role of HLX in vascular development in mouse and
   avian embryos.
   Approach and Results-In situ hybridization showed that Hlx is expressed
   in a subset of sprouting blood vessels in postnatal mouse retinas and
   embryos. Hlx expression was conserved in quail embryos and upregulated
   in blood vessels at the onset of circulation. In vitro assays showed
   that Hlx is dynamically regulated by growth factors and shear stress
   alterations. Proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor induces
   Hlx expression in cultured endothelial cells, whereas signals that
   induce stalk cell identity lead to a reduction in Hlx expression. HLX
   was also downregulated in embryos in which flow was ablated, whereas
   injection of a starch solution, which increases blood viscosity and
   therefore shear stress, causes an upregulation in HLX. HLX knockdown in
   vitro resulted in a reduction in tip cell marker expression and in
   reduced angiogenic sprouting, but Hlx(-/-) embryos showed no defect in
   vascular sprouting at E8.5, E9.5, or E11.5 in vivo. Vascular remodeling
   of the capillary plexus was altered in Hlx(-/-) embryos, with a modestly
   enlarged venous plexus and reduction of the arterial plexus.
   Conclusions-Our findings indicate not only that Hlx regulates sprouting
   in vitro, but that its role in sprouting is nonessential in vivo. We
   find HLX is regulated by shear stress and a subtle defect in vascular
   remodeling is present in knockout embryos.}},

Title = {{Biomass combustion for greenhouse carbon dioxide enrichment}},
Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{186-196}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Greenhouses in northern climates have a significant heat requirement
   that is mainly supplied by non-renewable fuels such as heating oil and
   natural gas. This project's goal was the development of an improved
   biomass furnace able to recover the heat and the CO2 available in the
   flue gas and use them in the greenhouse. A flue gas purification system
   was designed, constructed and installed on the chimney of a wood pellet
   furnace (SBI Caddy Alterna). The purification system consists of a rigid
   box air filter (MERV rating 14, 0.3 inn pores) followed by two sets of
   heating elements and a catalytic converter. The air filter removes the
   particulates present in the flue gas while the heating elements and
   catalysers transform the noxious gases into less harmful gases. Gas
   analysis was sampled at different locations in the system using a TESTO
   335 flue gas analyzer. The purification system reduces CO concentrations
   from 1100 cm(3) m(-3) to less than 1 cm(3) m(-3) NOx from 70 to 5.5
   cm(3) m(-3) SO2 from 19 cm(3) m(-3) to less than 1 cm 3 m(-3) and
   trapped particulates down to 0.3 gm with an efficiency greater than
   95\%. These results are satisfactory since they ensure human and plant
   safety after dilution into the ambient air of the greenhouse. The
   recuperation of the flue gas has several obvious benefits since it
   increases the heat usability per unit biomass and it greatly improves
   the CO2 recovery of biomass heating systems for the benefit of
   greenhouse grown plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{305-310}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: Increasing evidence suggests that ultrafine particles (UFPs)
   may contribute to cardiorespiratory morbidity. We examined the
   relationship between near road UFPs and several traffic and built
   environment factors to identify predictors that may be used to estimate
   exposures in population-based studies. Black carbon (BC) was also
   examined.
   Methods: Data were collected on up to 6 occasions at 73 sites in
   Montreal, Canada over 6-week period during summer, 2012. After excluding
   highly correlated variables, road width, truck ratio (trucks/total
   traffic), building height, land zoning parameters, and meteorological
   factors were evaluated. Random-effect models were used to estimate
   percent changes in UFP and BC concentrations with interquartile changes
   in each candidate predictor adjusted for meteorological factors.
   Results: Mean pollutant concentrations varied substantially across sites
   (UFP range: 1977-94, 798 particles/cm(3); BC range: 29-9460 ng/m(3)).
   After adjusting for meteorology, interquartile increases in road width
   (14\%, 95\% CI: 0, 30), building height (13\%, 95\% CI: 5, 22), and
   truck ratio (13\%, 95\% CI: 3, 23) were the most important predictors of
   mean UFP concentrations. Road width (28\%, 95\% CI: 9, 51) and
   industrial zoning (18\%, 95\% CI: 2, 37) were the strongest predictors
   of maximum UFP concentrations. Industrial zoning (35\%, 95\% CI: 9, 67)
   was the strongest predictor of BC.
   Conclusions: A number of traffic and built environmental factors were
   identified as important predictors of near road UFP and BC
   concentrations. Exposure models incorporating these factors may be
   useful in evaluating the health effects of traffic related air
   pollution. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc. This is

Title = {{MAE of phenolic compounds from blueberry leaves and comparison with
   other extraction methods}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{36-45}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Blueberry leaves are a prospective source of phenolic compounds which
   can be obtained by microwave assisted extraction leading to higher yield
   in shorter period of time and with lower solvent consumption when
   compared to solvent extraction. During this study, three experiments
   with microwave assisted extraction, were separately designed and
   conducted using highbush blueberry (variety Bluetta) leaves collected
   during the late fall season. The yields of different compounds obtained
   during these experiments with microwave extraction were compared with
   ultrasonic extraction for one hour and 24-h room temperature extraction.
   The first microwave assisted extraction experiment was conducted to
   streamline the combination of ethanol and citric acid concentration for
   further analysis of microwave as a potential extraction method for
   phenolic compounds and anthocyanins from blueberry leaves. During the
   second experiment the effect of microwave power level (10-20\% absolute
   power level) and time of extraction (4-16 min) on total phenolics, total
   anthocyanins and chlorogenic acid was studied which was further used to
   design the third experiment consisting of a face-centred central
   composite design with varying factors namely power level and time, each
   at 3 levels. All the experimental combinations for the 2nd and 3rd
   experiments were conducted with 80 ml of solvent consisting of 30\%
   ethanol and 1.5 M citric acid combination in ratio of 97:3 (v/v). The
   total anthocyanins and chlorogenic acid extracted during the study were
   between 2.321-2.636 mg malvidin 3-glucoside/g dry matter and 49.34-52.66
   mg chlorogenic acid/g dry matter respectively, not showing a huge
   variation between highest and lowest yields, however both compounds with
   a noteworthy yield. For total phenolics extraction, both microwave power
   and time of microwave application were observed to be statistically
   significant factors and the yield of total phenolics was found to be
   much higher (in the range of 92.719-128.76 mg GAE/g dry weight) than for
   24-h extraction at room temperature (average 89.164 mg GAE/g dry weight)
   and 1 h extraction by sonication (average 97.77 mg GAE/g dry weight)
   with the same solvent combination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The microstructure of CNC particles depends strongly on the drying
   method employed during manufacturing. The effect of different drying
   techniques, including spray drying, freeze drying, and spray freeze
   drying (SFD), on microstructure of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) particles
   was studied. Conventional drying methods (i.e. spray and freeze drying)
   yielded packed and dense agglomerates of CNC. Capillary forces and ice
   crystal growth play key roles in CNC aggregation during spray and freeze
   drying, respectively. It was found that, in the absence of these forces,
   in the SFD technique, the dispersed state of CNC in water could be
   frozen in. Thus, SFD of CNC suspension resulted in a powder with porous
   structure. A filament-like agglomerate structure consisting of
   nanofibers was formed at low CNC concentrations (ca. < 2 wt.\%), while a
   spherical foam structure was obtained at higher CNC concentrations.
   Polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites containing spray dried CNC, freeze
   dried CNC, and spray freeze dried CNC (CNCSFD) were prepared via melt
   mixing in an internal batch mixer. Optical light and scanning electron
   microscopy coupled with rheological properties showed better dispersion
   of CNCSFD agglomerates. Moreover, PP samples containing CNCSFD showed
   significant increases in mechanical properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Stable dispersions (nanofluids) are produced using plasma functionalized
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). To our knowledge, this study
   presents a first quantitative demonstration of nanofluid stability over
   extended periods of time (currently tested up to 8 months) and after
   intense heating. No agglomeration is found to occur in the water and
   glycol-based nanoiluids after heating at 85 and 170 degrees C,
   respectively. Significant agglomeration does occur for suspensions
   produced using the non-polar Therminol (R) VP-1 heat transfer fluid.
   Optical characterization of the nanofiuids demonstrates that the MWCNTs
   are highly absorbing over the majority of the solar spectrum, allowing
   for close to 100\% solar energy absorption, even at low concentrations
   and small collection volumes. These absorption properties coupled with
   the stability of the nanofluids make them ideal candidates as direct
   solar thermal collectors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the thermo-hydro-mechanical behaviour of a granitic
   rock. The cylindrical sample of granite contained a sealed fluid-filled
   cavity which was subjected to a cycle of temperature changes on its
   outer surface. The temperature and fluid pressure changes in the
   fluid-filled cavity were measured. Since the measurement of fluid
   pressure and temperature in the sealed cavity is experimentally
   feasible, the technique is a common feature in thermo-hydro-mechanical
   experiments. However, it was observed that regardless of how precisely
   the cavity was filled with de-aired water, air bubbles can still exist
   in the cavity and influence the fluid pressure changes. A novel
   technique is suggested for taking into account the influence of the
   volume of trapped air and eliminating its effect in the estimation of
   permeability. The experiment was computationally modelled using the
   finite element code COMSOL Multiphysics (TM) and the experimental
   results were compared with the computational estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Rare earth (RE) mineral deposits are typically processed using several
   different unit operations including flotation, gravity, magnetic and
   electrostatic separation techniques. Two of the most important
   beneficiation techniques for RE minerals are gravity and magnetic
   separation. Many RE minerals are found alongside low specific gravity
   gangue minerals thereby permitting the use of gravity separations to
   concentrate the heavy value RE minerals. Magnetic separation is used
   primarily to remove ferromagnetic gangue minerals as well as to separate
   individual paramagnetic rare earth minerals.
   This work investigated the use of a wet high intensity magnetic
   separation (WHIMS) in conjunction with gravity pre-concentration steps
   (Knelson and Falcon centrifugal concentrators) to beneficiate a rare
   earth ore. The results of these separation steps are related to the
   magnetic properties of RE minerals, based on literature and measurements
   conducted using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{For the past 120 years, hydrocyclones have been used a wide variety of
   industrial applications, with their main use in mineral processing being
   as a classifier. Hydrocyclone characterization relies heavily on
   empirical and phenomenological models. There is a need to develop a
   method by which the flow patterns can be quantified under industrial
   conditions. Positron emission particle tracking (PEPT), developed by the
   University of Birmingham in the late 1980s, has proven to be a powerful
   in situ visualization tool for engineering applications. This paper
   presents data on the motion of quartz particles in a two-inch
   hydrocyclone using the PEPT technique. Quartz tracer particles were
   labeled using the direct activation technique. The particle size range
   was between -2000 and +150 mu m which illustrates the flow pattern of
   particles reporting to the underflow. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published

Abstract = {{In cold climate regions, microorganisms in upper layers of soil are
   subject to low temperatures and repeated freeze thaw (FT) conditions
   during the winter. We studied the effects of cold temperature and FT
   cycles on the viability and survival strategies (namely motility and
   biofilm formation) of the common soil bacterium and model pathogen
   Bacillus subtilis. We also examined the effect of FT on the transport
   behavior of B. subtilis at two solution ionic strengths (IS: 10 and 100
   mM) in quartz sand packed columns. Finally, to study the mechanical
   properties of the bacteria-surface bond, a quartz crystal microbalance
   with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was used to monitor changes in bond
   stiffness when B. subtilis attached to a quartz substrate (model sand
   surface) under different environmental conditions. We observed that
   increasing the number of FT cycles decreased bacterial viability and
   that B. subtilis survived for longer time periods in higher IS-solution.
   FT treatment decreased bacterial swimming motility and the transcription
   of flagellin encoding genes. Although FT exposure had no significant
   effect on the bacterial growth rate, it substantially decreased B.
   subtilis biofilm formation and correspondingly decreased the
   transcription of matrix production genes in higher IS solution. As
   demonstrated with QCM-D, the bond stiffness between B. subtilis and the
   quartz surface decreased after FT. Moreover, column transport studies
   showed higher bacterial retention onto sand grains after exposure to FT.
   This investigation demonstrates how temperature variations around the
   freezing point in upper layers of soil can influence key bacterial
   properties and behavior, including survival and subsequent transport.

Abstract = {{Nonlinear forced vibrations of moderately thick functionally graded (FG)

   are considered at the plate edges. The equations of motion are obtained
   by using multi-modal energy approach. A code based on pseudo arc-length
   continuation and collocation scheme is utilized for numerical

Abstract = {{A systematic experimental investigation on microsegregation and second
   phase fraction of Mg-Al binary alloys (3, 6, and 9 wt pct Al) has been
   carried out over a wide range of cooling rates (0.05 to 700 K/s) by
   employing various casting techniques. In order to explain the
   experimental results, a solidification model that takes into account
   dendrite tip undercooling, eutectic undercooling, solute back diffusion,
   and secondary dendrite arm coarsening was also developed in dynamic
   linkage with an accurate thermodynamic database. From the experimental
   data and solidification model, it was found that the second phase
   fraction in the solidified microstructure is not determined only by
   cooling rate but varied independently with thermal gradient and
   solidification velocity. Lastly, the second phase fraction maps for
   Mg-Al alloys were calculated from the solidification model. (C) The

Abstract = {{A numerical formulation of solidification model which can predict the

   cooling rate range of 0.13 to 2.33 K/s and microstructural features such
   as secondary arm spacing, primary dendrite arm spacing, second phase
   fraction, and microsegregation were compared with the modeling results.
   Based on the model and the experimental data, a solidification map was

Abstract = {{Recent experimental results on detonation limits are reported in this
   paper. A parametric study was carried out to determine the minimum tube
   diameters for steady detonation propagation in five different
   hydrocarbon fuel-oxygen combustible mixtures and in five polycarbonate
   test tube diameters ranging from 50.8 mm down to a small scale of 1.5
   mm. The wave propagation in the tube was monitored by optical fibers. By
   decreasing the initial pressure, hence the sensitivity of the mixture,
   the onset of limits is indicated by an abrupt drop in the steady
   detonation velocity after a short distance of travel. From the measured
   wave velocities inside the test tube, the critical pressure
   corresponding to the limit and the minimum tube diameters for the
   propagation of the detonation can be obtained. The present experimental
   results are in good agreement with previous studies and show that the
   measured minimum tube diameters can be reasonably estimated on the basis
   of the /3 rule over a wide range of conditions, where is the detonation
   cell size. These new data shall be useful for safety assessment in
   process industries and in developing and validating models for

Title = {{Transmission of vertical soil stress under agricultural tyres: Comparing
   measurements with simulations}},
Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{106-117}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The transmission of stress induced by agricultural machinery within an
   agricultural soil is typically modelled on the basis of the theory of
   stress transmission in elastic media, usually in the semi-empirical form
   that includes the ``concentration factor{''} (v). The aim of this paper
   was to measure and simulate soil stress under defined loads. Stress in
   the soil profile at 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 m depth was measured during
   wheeling at a water content close to field capacity on five soils
   (13-66\% clay). Stress transmission was then simulated with a
   semi-analytical model, using vertical stress at 0.1 m depth estimated
   from tyre characteristics as the upper boundary condition, and v was
   obtained at minimum deviation between measurements and simulations. For
   the five soils, we obtained an average v of 3.5 (for stress transmitting
   from 0.1 to 0.7 m depth). This was only slightly different from v = 3
   for which the elasticity theory-based classical solution of Boussinesq
   (1885) is satisfied. We noted that the estimated v was strongly
   dependent on (i) the reliability of stress measurements, and (ii) the
   upper stress boundary condition used for simulations. Finite element
   simulations indicated that the transmission of vertical stresses in a
   layered soil is not appreciably different from that seen in a
   homogeneous soil unless very high differences in soil stiffness are
   considered. Our results highlight the importance of accurate stress
   readings and realistic upper model boundary conditions, and suggest that
   the actual stress transmission could be well predicted according to the
   theory of elasticity for the conditions investigated. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The magnetic properties of non-oriented electrical steels (NOES) are an
   important factor in determining the efficiency of electric vehicle
   drivetrains. Due to the highly variable texture of NOES, the
   relationships between crystal orientation, the magnetic domain
   structure, and the final magnetic properties are complicated and not
   fully understood. In this study, a NOES sample was characterized with a
   method capable of imaging surface magnetic domains using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) with an electron backscatter diffraction
   (EBSD) system equipped with a forescatter detector. This method used
   type II magnetic contrast without a specialized SEM setup, and imaged
   with a resolution limit of approximately 250-300 nm. The domain
   structure of the NOES sample was successfully related to which was
   defined as the angle between the closest magnetic easy axis and the
   surface of the sample (the RD-TD plane). However, it was shown that if
   the easy axes were aligned between neighbouring grains with respect to
   the grain boundary normal, the domain structure could align with an easy
   axis that was not the closest to the surface, and complex domain
   structures could be become wider. This structure and width change of
   complex domain structures has not been previously observed from single
   crystal or large-grained material studies. The successful application of
   this method to reveal the influence of surrounding grains can be used to
   better understand the magnetic properties of NOES. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Anaerobic digestion (AD) treatment of agricultural and animal waste can
   be considered as a means of enabling environmental remediation. This
   research investigated two conditions of anaerobic co-digestion of maize
   waste and cow dung. This was done by placing a mixture of cow dung and
   maize waste together in a floating drum digester that was run at two
   different cow dung/maize ratios of 10:1 and 10:5. Batch conditions were
   on a bench-scale of AD, 5 L in volume, developed to operate under
   mesophilic (36 1(degrees)C). Results showed that biogas and methane
   yields from mesophilic digestion at the ratio of 10:1 were lower than
   yields obtained at ratio tested in the second run (10:5). Biogas yields
   were 250 and 480 L/kg VS for first and second runs, respectively. In the
   case of methane, these amounts were presented at 130 and 300 L/kg VS.
   Furthermore, the average methane content of biogas was calculated as 51
   and 62\%, in first and second runs respectively. The total biogas
   production of the reactor increased by 92\% when substrates were fed in
   second condition ratio compared to biogas production during the first
   condition ratio. In continue the effect of adding maize waste on biogas
   yield from cow dung was evaluated in batch digesters under mesophilic
   conditions. The addition of maize waste to cow dung presents a viable
   method to improve biogas yield, as well as a means to use maize waste.

Abstract = {{A model for the mechanics (oscillating deformation), heat transfer
   including viscoelastic heat generation and friction dissipation, and
   degree of adhesion (intimate contact and healing) is proposed for the
   initial transient heating phase.
   Numerical resolution was performed using a multi-physical finite element
   code. The predicted dissipated power evolution exhibits a good
   correlation with previous experimental measurement of delivered power,
   and shows that the apparatus has a global efficiency of 13\%. The
   predicted degree of adhesion also confirms the experimental observation
   that adhesion starts at the edge of the contact area, and progressively
   extends to the whole contact area.
   The numerical model was further used to investigate the physical
   mechanisms occurring during the welding process. As suggested in the
   literature, the first heating mechanism is confirmed to be due to
   interfacial friction. Bulk viscoelastic dissipation becomes predominant
   when the interface reaches higher temperatures. The dissipated power is
   suddenly increased when the whole interface reaches the glass transition
   temperature. (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   4.37 g/100 g fat content. Higher rice flour content in batter
   significantly increased the fraction of inter-particle spaces occupied
   by air (SOA), and decreased the fraction of spaces occupied by moisture
   (SOM) and fat (SOF). Longer pre-drying times showed greater fraction of
   spaces occupied by air, and smaller fraction of spaces occupied by
   moisture and fat. SOA, SOM, and SOF of the batter systems ranged from
   2.2\% to 46.03\%, 2.55 to 47.07\%, and 035\% to 11.11\%, respectively.
   Using higher amount of wheat flour in batter and longer pre-drying time
   showed to significantly decrease fat uptake during frying. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{H2O2 reduction reaction (HPRR) is studied on both graphene (GNF) and
   nitrogen doped graphene nanoflakes in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution by rotating
   disk electrode. The XPS results indicate that N-doped graphene
   nanoflakes with high nitrogen content, 32 at\%N (N-GNF32), are
   synthesised successfully by an inductively-coupled thermal plasma (ICP)
   reactor. Pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic N species contribute up to
   67\% of the total nitrogen. Kinetic parameters such as Tafel slope and
   stoichiometric number suggest that HPRR occurs by the same mechanism on
   both GNF and N-GNF32. Although nitrogen does not change the mechanism of
   HPRR, the results indicate that the reaction rate of H2O2 reduction is
   enhanced on N-GNF32. The exchange current density of H2O2 reduction
   based on the active surface area of N-GNF32 is (8.3 +/- 0.3) 10(-9) A
   cm(-2), which is 6 times higher than the value determined for GNF. The
   apparent number of electrons involved in the process suggests that H2O2
   decomposition competes with H2O2 reduction on both catalysts. Evaluation
   of the apparent heterogeneous reaction rate constant and the Tafel slope
   indicate that simultaneous reduction of O-2 and H2O2 is negligible on
   the N-GNF32. On the other hand, the reduction of O-2 and H2O2 occurs
   simultaneously on the GNF surface. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Cast films, based on polypropylene (PP), were prepared via melt
   extrusion and, then, annealed below the melting temperature. The effect
   of annealing conditions on the properties of the films and the
   microporous membranes formed by stretching was investigated. It is shown
   that annealing is an effective method to improve the physical properties
   of semi-crystalline polymers by promoting chain rearrangement and
   creating secondary lamellae in the amorphous region. DSC results for
   annealed samples revealed the appearance of a shoulder endothermic peak
   and a new peak in the correlation function from the SAXS patterns was
   observed. The annealed films exhibited double yield points in the
   tensile deformation curves. A direct linear relationship was found
   between the strength of the second yield point and the fraction of the
   lamellae. From mercury porosimetry and SEM images of the membranes
   larger pore sizes and porosity were observed as the annealing time and
   temperature increased. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

   maps are based on a recently completed high-resolution global lithology
   map that differentiates fine and coarse-grained sediments and
   sedimentary rocks, which is important since these have different
   permeabilities. The average polygon size in the new map is similar to
   100 km(2), which is a more than hundredfold increase in resolution
   compared to the previous map which has an average polygon size of
   similar to 14,000 km(2). We also significantly improve the
   representation in regions of weathered tropical soils and permafrost.
   The spatially distributed mean global permeability similar to 10(-15)
   m(2) with permafrost or similar to 10(-14) m(2) without permafrost. The

Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{10-19}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Mixing in chemical microreactors is a multi-scale processes as the
   transport mechanisms occur at different length scales. Since the small
   scale mixing depends mainly on molecular diffusion, a relatively long
   channel is necessary to achieve the desired mixing. To improve the
   mixing quality whilst keeping easy and simple manufacturing, an
   innovative design of microchannel T-junction with wavy structure is
   proposed to trigger secondary flow for enhanced chaotic mixing. To gain
   better understanding of the interplay of transport mechanism, we develop
   numerical model for micro-mixing in micro-channel T-junction with wavy
   structure; the model considers single phase mixing of laminar Newtonian
   miscible fluid and it solves for conservation of mass, momentum and
   species. To ensure robust and accurate solutions, several discretization
   methods and mesh sizes were tested and compared; while to ensure
   fidelity of the comparison of mixing performance, we introduce the
   performance index (PI) concept for the first time in micromixing area.
   The numerical results suggest that the mixing quality and PI improves
   significantly for microchannel T-junction with wavy structure,
   especially at higher Reynolds number. The performance enhancement is
   also seen for all range of Schmidt numbers, wavy frequencies and
   amplitudes considered, which shows potential for several practical
   applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites containing spray-dried cellulose
   nanocrystals (CNC), freeze-dried CNC, and spray-freeze-dried CNC
   (CNCSFD) were prepared via melt mixing in an internal batch mixer.
   Polarized light, scanning electron, and atomic force microscopy showed
   significantly better dispersion of CNCSFD in PP/CNC nanocomposites
   compared with the spray-dried and freeze-dried CNCs. Rheological
   measurements, including linear and nonlinear viscoelastic tests, were
   performed on PP/CNC samples. The microscopy results were supported by
   small-amplitude oscillatory shear tests, which showed substantial rises
   in the magnitudes of key rheological parameters of PP samples containing
   CNCSFD. Steady-shear results revealed a strong shear thinning behavior
   of PP samples containing CNCSFD. Moreover, PP melts containing CNCSFD
   exhibited a yield stress. The magnitude of the yield stress and the
   degree of shear thinning behavior increased with CNCSFD concentration.
   It was found that CNCSFD agglomerates with a weblike structure were more
   effective in modifying the rheological properties. This effect was
   attributed to better dispersion of the agglomerates with the weblike
   structure. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed considerable improvement
   in the modulus of samples containing CNCSFD agglomerates. The
   percolation mechanical model with modified volume percolation threshold
   and filler network strength values and the Halpin-Kardos model were used
   to fit the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{In order to comprehensively use magnesium and silicon resources existing
   in serpentine ore, an efficient process for decomposing serpentine by
   the use of concentrated NaOH solution is proposed at elevated
   temperature. In this new process, magnesium is obtained as residues with
   the form of Mg(OH)(2) after filtration, while silicon is dissolved in an
   alkaline solution and then separated by a crystallization operation with
   the common ion effect of NaOH at relatively low temperature.
   Solubilities of sodium metasilicate nonahydrate (Na2SiO3 center dot
   9H(2)O) and anhydrous sodium metasilicate (Na2SiO3) in NaOH solutions
   were measured. The experiments were carried out at the temperature range
   from 288.2 to 313.2 K and 343.2 to 353.2 K for these two solids,
   respectively. Over the investigated concentration range from 0.0 to 11.2
   mol.kg(-1), the addition of NaOH caused the solubility of both Na2SiO3
   center dot 9H(2)O and Na2SiO3 to decrease due to common ion effect. It
   was also found that increasing the temperature favored the solubility of
   sodium metasilicate nonahydrate but depressed the solubility of
   anhydrous sodium metasilicate in NaOH solutions. A chemical model has
   been established with newly obtained interaction parameters of the
   Bromley-Zemaitis model by regressing the experimental solubility of
   Na2SiO3 center dot 9H(2)O in NaOH solutions from 288.2 to 313.2 K along
   with the experimental solubility data of Na2SiO3 in NaOH solutions at
   353.2 K.}},

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with linear precoding designs for multiuser
   downlink transmissions. We consider a multiple-input single-output
   (MISO) system with multiple single-antenna user equipment (UE)
   experiencing non-homogeneous average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   conditions. The first part of this work examines different precoding
   schemes with perfect channel state information (CSI) and average SNR at
   the base-station (eNB). We then propose a weighted minimum mean squared
   error (WMMSE) precoder, which takes advantage of the non-homogeneous SNR
   conditions. Given in a closed-form solution, the proposed WMMSE precoder
   outperforms other well-known linear precoders, such as zero-forcing
   (ZF), regularized ZF (RZF), while achieving a close performance to the
   locally optimal iterative WMMSE (IWMMSE) precoder, in terms of the
   achievable network sum-rate. In the second part of this work, we
   consider the non-homogeneous multiuser system with limited and quantized
   channel quality indicator (CQI) and channel direction indicator (CDI)
   feedbacks. Based on the CQI and CDI feedback models proposed for the
   Long-Term Evolution Advanced standard, we then propose a robust WMMSE
   precoder in a closed-form solution which takes into account the
   quantization errors. Simulation shows a significant improvement in the
   achievable network sum-rate by the proposed robust WMMSE precoder,
   compared to non-robust linear precoder designs.}},

Title = {{Multi-Loop Social Learning for Sustainable Land and Water Governance:
   Towards a Research Agenda on the Potential of Virtual Learning Platforms}},

Abstract = {{Managing social-ecological systems and human well being in a sustainable
   way requires knowledge of these systems in their full complexity.
   Multi-loop social learning is recognized as a crucial element to
   sustainable decision-making for land and water resources management
   involving a process of managing change where the central methodological
   concern is with effectively engaging the necessary participation of
   system members in contributing to the collective knowledge of the
   system. Ensuring the inclusion of the community of concern may help to
   ensure robust knowledge, the necessary plurality of views,
   responsibility sharing and trust enhancement. This will also provide
   more dynamic lines of input to problem solving: local and changing forms
   of knowledge, emerging concerns and constraints all feed into an ongoing
   decision-making process. This conceptual paper is focused specifically
   on identifying the key drivers and conditions that facilitate multi-loop
   social learning and the untapped potential of virtual learning platforms
   in this context. The hyper-connectivity that characterizes digitally
   mediated networks opens up significant possibilities for information
   exchange, knowledge creation, feedback, debate, learning and innovation,
   social networking, and so on. This paper provides a thorough literature
   review of the conditions and affordances that are conducive to
   multi-loop social learning in the context of sustainable land and water
   governance. The insights from this review confirm the potential of a
   `learning ecology' or virtual learning platform for knowledge
   co-production, trust building, sense making, critical self-reflection,
   vertical and horizontal collaboration, and conflict resolution, while
   serving as a facilitating platform between different levels of
   governance, and across resource and knowledge systems. To conclude this
   paper, a developmental research agenda is proposed to refine and improve
   understanding of multi-loop social learning processes and their
   effective facilitation through virtual learning platforms. (C) 2014

   hydrology: A review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{514}},
Pages = {{358-377}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Accurate and reliable water resources planning and management to ensure
   sustainable use of watershed resources cannot be achieved without
   precise and reliable models. Notwithstanding the highly stochastic
   nature of hydrological processes, the development of models capable of
   describing such complex phenomena is a growing area of research.
   Providing insight into the modeling of complex phenomena through a
   thorough overview of the literature, current research, and expanding
   research horizons can enhance the potential for accurate and well
   designed models.
   The last couple of decades have seen remarkable progress in the ability
   to develop accurate hydrologic models. Among various conceptual and
   black box models developed over this period, hybrid wavelet and
   Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models have been amongst the most
   promising in simulating hydrologic processes. The present review focuses
   on defining hybrid modeling, the advantages of such combined models, as
   well as the history and potential future of their application in
   hydrology to predict important processes of the hydrologic cycle. Over
   the years, the use of wavelet-AI models in hydrology has steadily
   increased and attracted interest given the robustness and accuracy of
   the approach. This is attributable to the usefulness of wavelet
   transforms in multi-resolution analysis, de-noising, and edge effect
   detection over a signal, as well as the strong capability of AI methods
   in optimization and prediction of processes. Several ideas for future
   areas of research are also presented in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We document the hygroscopic swelling and shrinkage of the central and
   the thickest secondary cell wall layer of wood (named S2) in response to
   changes in environmental humidity using synchrotron radiation-based
   phase contrast X-ray tomographic nanoscopy. The S2 layer is a natural
   fibre-reinforced nano-composite polymer and is strongly reactive to
   water. Using focused ion beam, micropillars with a cross section of few
   micrometres are fabricated from the S2 layer of the latewood cell walls
   of Norway spruce softwood. The thin neighbouring cell wall layers are
   removed to prevent hindering or restraining of moisture-induced
   deformation during swelling or shrinkage. The proposed experiment
   intended to get further insights into the microscopic origin of the
   anisotropic hygro-expansion of wood. It is found that the
   swelling/shrinkage strains are highly anisotropic in the transverse
   plane of the cell wall, larger in the normal than in the direction
   parallel to the cell wall's thickness. This ultrastructural anisotropy
   may be due to the concentric lamellation of the cellulose microfibrils
   as the role of the cellulose microfibril angle in the transverse
   swelling anisotropy is negligible. The volumetric swelling of the cell
   wall material is found to be substantially larger than the one of wood
   tissues within the growth ring and wood samples made of several growth
   rings. The hierarchical configuration in wood optimally increases its
   dimensional stability in response to a humid environment with higher
   scales of complexity.}},

Abstract = {{As a class of key building blocks in the chemical industry, aromatic
   compounds are mainly derived from the catalytic reforming of
   petroleum-based long chain hydrocarbons. The dehydroaromatization of

   nanowires (NWs) with a 97\% rationally constructed m-plane can directly
   convert methane into benzene and molecular hydrogen under ultraviolet
   (UV) illumination at rt. Mechanistic studies suggest that the exposed
   m-plane of GaN exhibited particularly high activity toward methane C-H
   bond activation and the quantum efficiency increased linearly as a
   function of light intensity. The incorporation of a Si-donor or
   Mg-acceptor dopants into GaN also has a large influence on the

Abstract = {{Numerous investigations of RC beams strengthened in shear with
   externally-bonded (EB) fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets, plates and
   strips have been successfully conducted in recent years. These valuable
   studies have highlighted a number of influencing parameters that are not
   captured by the design guidelines. The objective of this study was: (1)
   to highlight experimentally and analytically the influential parameters
   on the shear contribution of FRP to RC beams strengthened in shear using
   EB FRP sheets and strips; and (2) to develop a set of transparent,
   coherent, and evolutionary design equations to calculate the shear
   resistance of RC beams strengthened in shear. In the experimental part
   of this study, 12 tests were performed on 4,520-mm-long T-beams. The
   specimens were strengthened in shear using carbon FRP (CFRP) strips and
   sheets. The test variables were: (1) the presence or absence of internal
   transverse-steel reinforcement; (2) use of FRP sheets versus FRP strips;
   and (3) the axial rigidity of the EB FRP reinforcement. In the
   analytical part of this study, new design equations were proposed to
   consider the effect of transverse-steel in addition to other influential
   parameters on the shear contribution of FRP. The accuracy of the
   proposed equations has been verified in this study by predicting the FRP
   shear contribution of experimentally tested RC beams.}},

Abstract = {{A number of aquifers worldwide are being depleted, mainly by
   agricultural activities, yet groundwater stress has not been explicitly
   linked to specific agricultural crops. Using the newly developed concept
   of the groundwater footprint (the area required to sustain groundwater
   use and groundwater-dependent ecosystem services), we develop a
   methodology to derive crop-specific groundwater footprints. We
   illustrate this method by calculating high-resolution groundwater
   footprint estimates of crops in two heavily used aquifer systems: the
   Central Valley and High Plains, U. S. In both aquifer systems, hay and
   haylage, corn, and cotton have the largest groundwater footprints, which
   highlights that most of the groundwater stress is induced by crops meant
   for cattle feed. Our results are coherent with other studies in the High
   Plains but suggest lower groundwater stress in the Central Valley,
   likely due to artificial recharge from surface water diversions which
   were not taken into account in previous estimates. Uncertainties of
   recharge and irrigation application efficiency contribute the most to
   the total relative uncertainty of the groundwater footprint to aquifer
   area ratios. Our results and methodology will be useful for
   hydrologists, water resource managers, and policy makers concerned with
   which crops are causing the well-documented groundwater stress in
   semiarid to arid agricultural regions around the world.}},

Abstract = {{Phytochemical complexity of plant foods confers health-promoting
   benefits including chemopreventive and anticancer effects. Isolating
   single constituents from complex foods may render them inactive,
   emphasizing the importance of preserving the natural composition of
   whole extracts. Recently, we demonstrated in vitro synergy among the
   most abundant bioactive constituents of ginger extract (GE), viz.,
   6-gingerol (6G), 8-gingerol (8G), 10-gingerol (10G) and 6-shogaol (6S).
   However, no study has yet examined the in vivo collaboration among
   ginger phytochemicals or evaluated the importance, if any, of the
   natural `milieu' preserved in whole extract. Here, we comparatively
   evaluated in vivo efficacy of GE with an artificial quasi-mixture (Mix)
   formulated by combining four most active ginger constituents at
   concentrations equivalent to those present in whole extract. Orally fed
   GE showed 2.4-fold higher tumor growth-inhibitory efficacy than Mix in
   human prostate tumor xenografts. Pharmacokinetic evaluations and
   bioavailability measurements addressed the efficacy differences between
   GE and Mix. Plasma concentration-time profiles revealed multiple peaking
   phenomenon for ginger constituents when they were fed as GE as opposed
   to Mix, indicating enterohepatic recirculation. Bioavailability of 6G,
   8G, 10G and 6S was 1.6-, 1.1-, 2.5- and 3.4-fold higher, respectively,
   when dosed with GE compared with Mix. In addition, gingerol glucuronides
   were detected in feces upon intravenous administration confirming
   hepatobiliary elimination. These data ascribe the superior in vivo
   efficacy of GE to higher area under the concentration time curves,
   greater residence time and enhanced bioavailability, of ginger
   phytochemicals, when fed as a natural extract compared with artificial
   Mix, emphasizing the usefulness of consuming whole foods over single
   agents.}},

Title = {{A Medical Cloud-Based Platform for Respiration Rate Measurement and

Abstract = {{The measurement of human respiratory signals is crucial in
   cyberbiological systems. A disordered breathing pattern can be the first
   symptom of different physiological, mechanical, or psychological
   dysfunctions. Therefore, a real-time monitoring of the respiration
   patterns, as well as respiration rate is a critical need in medical
   applications. There are several methods for respiration rate
   measurement. However, despite their accuracy, these methods are
   expensive and could not be integrated in a body sensor network. In this
   work, we present a real-time cloud-based platform for both monitoring
   the respiration rate and breath pattern classification, remotely. The
   proposed system is designed particularly for patients with breathing
   problems (e. g., respiratory complications after surgery) or sleep
   disorders. Our system includes calibrated accelerometer sensor,
   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud-computing model. We also suggest a
   procedure to improve the accuracy of respiration rate for patients at
   rest positions. The overall error in the respiration rate calculation is
   obtained 0.53\% considering SPR-BTA spirometer as the reference. Five
   types of respiration disorders, Bradapnea, Tachypnea, Cheyn-stokes,
   Kaussmal, and Biot's breathing are classified based on hierarchical
   Support Vector Machine (SVM) with seven different features. We have
   evaluated the performance of the proposed classification while it is
   individualized to every subject (case 1) as well as considering all
   subjects (case 2). Since the selection of kernel function is a key
   factor to decide SVM's performance, in this paper three different kernel
   functions are evaluated. The experiments are conducted with 11 subjects
   and the average accuracy of 94.52\% for case 1 and the accuracy of
   81.29\% for case 2 are achieved based on Radial Basis Function (RBF).
   Finally, a performance evaluation has been done for normal and impaired
   subjects considering sensitivity, specificity and G-mean parameters of
   different kernel functions.}},

Abstract = {{Two low-C steels, one microalloyed with Ti and the other with Ti and Mo
   were subjected to a classical controlled rolling schedule using torsion
   testing. The specific torsion schedules were a simulation of an
   industrial schedule adapted to the characteristic transformation
   temperatures of each steel. It is shown that such steels can develop a
   pancaked austenite, despite the fact that the alloys do not contain Nb.
   However, compared to Nb bearing steels, restoration between deformation
   passes is relatively rapid in the pancaking region. In order to reduce
   the loss of pancaking, the temperatures of the finishing rolling
   schedule were shifted to lower temperatures. This appeared to greatly
   reduce the restoration rates, but the transformation in the two phase
   region occurred towards the end of the final deformation pass. When
   comparing the two steels, it could be detected that Mo increases the
   temperature range for pancaking and reduces the restoration rates
   between deformation passes in the pancaking region.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the isolated and combined effects of network
   congestion, roadway grade, passenger load, and fuel type on transit bus
   emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) through a simulation of transit
   operations and emissions along a busy corridor. We also test the effect
   of changing random seed on overall corridor emissions. We observe that
   positive grades have strong effects on emissions. Grade also causes
   other variables to become important such as passenger load. While an
   increasing passenger load on the bus increases emissions, we observe
   that the addition of each passenger influences the per-passenger
   emissions differently depending on the bus occupancy. When the bus is
   less crowded each additional passenger can decrease per-passenger
   emissions by 5\% whereas the reduction becomes 1.2\% when the bus is
   crowded. Finally, we observe that the reduction potential of compressed
   natural gas (CNG) compared to conventional diesel could reach up to 40\%
   depending on speed, grade, and passenger load. CNG benefits increase
   with increasing congestion, and decrease with increasing grade and
   passenger load. The results of this study are most relevant to transit
   planners in the evaluation of potential operational changes with
   emission reduction potential and in the allocation of alternative
   fuelled buses along selected transit corridors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   Techniques for Water Quality Variables}},
Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{225}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nine record extension techniques were explored: ordinary
   least squares (OLS), maintenance of variance extension techniques
   (MOVE1, MOVE2, MOVE3, and MOVE4), Kendall-Theil robust line (KTRL),
   artificial neural network (ANN), and two recently developed techniques
   (RLOC and KTRL2). The first technique is the robust line of organic
   correlation (RLOC), which is a modified version of MOVE1 with the
   advantage of being robust in the presence of outliers and/or deviation
   from normality. The second technique is a modified version of the KTRL
   (KTRL2) that has the advantage of being able to maintain the variance in
   the extended records. Water quality data from the Nile Delta monitoring
   network in Egypt were used to conduct an empirical experiment. The nine
   record extension techniques were used to extend the Chloride records
   using Electric Conductivity as a predictor. A comparison was carried out
   between the nine techniques to assess their ability to provide extended
   records that preserve different statistical characteristics of the
   observed records. Results showed that the RLOC and KTRL2 are better than
   other techniques in preserving the characteristics of the entire
   distribution. However, the ANN and KTRL techniques are superior in
   estimating individual water quality records. The RLOC or KTRL2
   techniques are recommended for extending records of discontinued water
   quality variables in the Nile Delta, while the ANN and KTRL techniques
   are recommended for the substitution of missing values. In addition, a
   Monte Carlo experiment was conducted to assess the impact of the
   presence of outliers on the performance of the MOVE techniques as well
   as the KTRL2 and RLOC. Results of the Monte Carlo experiment showed
   that, in the presence of outliers, the KTRL2 and RLOC techniques
   outperform the MOVE techniques.}},

Title = {{On the Carrier Injection Efficiency and Thermal Property of InGaN/GaN
   Axial Nanowire Light Emitting Diodes}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the impact of surface recombination on the
   effective carrier injection efficiency and the Joule heating of axial
   InGaN/GaN nanowire light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The results reveal that
   the carrier injection efficiency of such devices is extremely low
   (<10\%), due to the severe carrier loss through nonradiative surface
   recombination. It is further observed that the thermal resistance of
   typical nanowire LEDs is comparable with, or lower than that of their
   planar counterparts, in spite of the reduced thermal conductivity of
   nanowires. The poor carrier injection efficiency, however, leads to
   significantly elevated junction temperatures for nanowire LEDs. We have
   further demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally, that the
   carrier injection efficiency can be significantly improved in p-doped
   nanowires, due to the downward surface band bending, and in
   InGaN/GaN/AlGaN dot-in-a-wire core-shell nanoscale heterostructures, due
   to the superior carrier confinement offered by the large bandgap AlGaN
   shell. This paper offers important insight for the design and epitaxial
   growth of high-performance nanowire LEDs.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, DFT-based oversampled perfect reconstruction filter banks
   (OPRFB), as a special form of filtered multitone, have shown great
   promises for applications to multicarrier modulation. Still, accurate
   frequency synchronization and channel equalization are needed for their
   reliable operation in practical scenarios. In this paper, we first
   derive a data-aided joint maximum likelihood (ML) estimator of the
   carrier frequency offset (CFO) and the channel impulse response (CIR)
   for OPRFB transceiver systems operating over frequency selective fading
   channels. Then, by exploiting the structural and spectral properties of
   these systems, we are able to considerably reduce the complexity of the
   proposed estimator through simplifications of the underlying likelihood
   function. The Cramer Rao bound on the variance of unbiased CFO and CIR
   estimators is also derived. The performance of the proposed ML estimator
   is investigated by means of numerical simulations under realistic
   conditions with CFO and frequency selective fading channels. The effects
   of different pilot schemes on the estimation performance for
   applications over time-invariant and mobile time-varying channels are
   also examined. The results show that the proposed joint ML estimator
   exhibits an excellent performance, where it can accurately estimate the
   unknown CFO and CIR parameters for the various experimental setups under
   consideration.}},

Title = {{Correspondence of bubble size and frother partitioning in flotation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{The size of bubbles created in the flotation process is of great
   importance to the efficiency of the mineral separation achieved.
   Meanwhile, it is believed that frother transport between phases is
   perhaps the most important reason for the interactive nature of the
   phenomena occurring in the bulk and froth phases in flotation, as
   frother adsorbed in the surface of rising bubbles is removed from the
   bulk phase and then released into the froth as a fraction of the bubbles
   burst. This causes the increased concentration in the froth compared to
   the bulk concentration, named as frother partitioning. Partitioning
   reflects the adsorption of frother on bubbles and how to influence
   bubble size is not known. There currently exists no such a topic aiming
   to link these two key parameters. To fill this vacancy, the
   correspondence between bubble size and frother partitioning was
   examined. Bubble size was measured by sampling-for-imaging (SFI)
   technique. Using total organic carbon (TOC) analysis to measure the
   frother partitioning between froth and bulk phases was determined.
   Measurements have shown, with no exceptions including four different
   frothers, higher frother concentration is in the bulk than in the froth.
   The results also show strong partitioning giving an increase in bubble
   size which implies there is a compelling relationship between these two,
   represented by C (Froth)/C (Bulk) and D (32). The C (Froth)/C (Bulk) and
   D (32) curves show similar exponential decay relationships as a function
   of added frother in the system, strongly suggesting that the frother
   concentration gradient between the bulk solution and the bubble
   interface is the driving force contributing to bubble size reduction.}},

Title = {{Evolution of the scalar dissipation rate downstream of a concentrated

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},

Volume = {{749}},
Pages = {{227-274}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The dissipation rate, epsilon(theta), of a passive scalar (temperature
   in air) emitted from a concentrated source into a fully developed
   high-aspect-ratio turbulent channel flow is studied. The goal of the
   present work is to investigate the return to isotropy of the scalar
   field when the scalar is injected in a highly anisotropic manner into an
   inhomogeneous turbulent flow at small scales. Both experiments and
   direct numerical simulations (DNS) were used to study the downstream
   evolution of epsilon(g) for scalar fields generated by line sources
   located at the channel centreline (y(s)/h = 1.0)and near the wall
   (y(s)/h = 0.17). The temperature fluctuations and temperature
   derivatives were measured by means of a pair of parallel cold-wire
   thermometers in a flow at Re-tau=520. The DNS were performed at Re-tau=
   190 using a spectral method to solve the continuity and Navier-Stokes
   equations, and a flux integral method (Germaine, Mydlarski \&
   Cortelezzi, J. Comput. Phys., vol. 174, 2001, pp. 614-648) for the
   advection-diffusion equation. The statistics of the scalar field
   computed from both experimental and numerical data were found to be in
   good agreement, with certain discrepancies that were attributable to the
   difference in the Reynolds numbers of the two flows. A return to
   isotropy of the small scales was never perfectly observed in any region
   of the channel for the downstream distances studied herein. However, a
   continuous decay of the small-scale anisotropy was observed for the
   scalar field generated by the centreline line source in both the
   experiments and DNS. The scalar mixing was found to be more rapid in the
   near-wall region, where the experimental results exhibited low levels of
   small-scale anisotropy. However, the DNS, which were performed at lower
   Re-tau, showed that persistent anisotropy can also exist near the wall,
   independently of the downstream location. The role of the mean velocity
   gradient in the production of epsilon(theta) (and therefore anisotropy)
   in the near-wall region was highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{The fluctuation-dissipation theorem establishes the fundamental links
   between thermomechanical noise and damping. In this paper, we bridge the
   gap between theory and practice by developing protocols for estimating
   dissipation in low-loss microresonators by measuring thermomechanical
   noise using laser Doppler vibrometry. The measurement does not require
   external actuation of the device and damping can be estimated without
   relying upon knowledge of material properties, device dimensions, or
   structural stiffness. The power spectral density of velocity and
   displacement noise is computed using a direct method that avoids
   segmenting the measurements in the time domain, thereby avoiding any
   bias in the estimation of the quality factor. We demonstrate the
   implementation of the protocol by measuring damping at room temperature
   and low pressure in four silicon-based microcantilever resonators with
   natural frequencies ranging from 17.6 to 26.7 kHz and quality factors
   ranging from 2 x 10(4) to 2 x 10(5). The accuracy of noise-based
   estimates is evaluated by comparison with values of the log decrement

Title = {{A higher-order mathematical modeling for dynamic behavior of protein

   effects}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Microtubules in mammalian cells are cylindrical protein polymers which
   structurally and dynamically organize functional activities in living
   cells. They are important for maintaining cell structures, providing
   platforms for intracellular transport, and forming the spindle during
   mitosis, as well as other cellular processes. Various in vitro studies
   have shown that microtubules react to applied mechanical loading and
   physical environment. To investigate the mechanisms underlying such
   phenomena, a mathematical model based on the orthotropic higher-order
   shear deformation shell formulation and Hamilton's principle is
   presented in this paper for dynamic behavior of microtubules. The
   numerical results obtained by the proposed shell model are verified by
   the experimental data from the literature, showing great consistency.
   The nonlocal elasticity theory is also utilized to describe the
   nano-scale effects of the microtubule structure. The wave propagation
   and vibration characteristics of the microtubule are examined in the
   presence and absence of the cytosol employing proposed formulations. The
   effects of different system parameters such as length, small scale
   parameter, and cytosol viscosity on vibrational behavior of a
   microtubule are elucidated. The definitions of critical length and
   critical viscosity are introduced and the results obtained using the
   higher order shell model are compared with those obtained employing a
   first-order shear deformation theory. This comparison shows that the
   small scale effects become important for higher values of the wave
   vector and the proposed model gives more accurate results for both small
   and large values of wave vectors. Moreover, it is shown that for higher
   circumferential wave number, the torsional wave velocity obtained by the
   higher-order shell model tend to be higher than the one predicted by the
   first-order shell model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion couple experiments for the Mg-Gd and Mg-Y systems were
   performed with Mg single crystals to investigate the anisotropic
   diffusion behavior of Gd and Y in hexagonal close packed (hcp) Mg at
   temperatures between 703 and 803 K (430 and 530 C). Diffusion
   coefficients for both Gd and Y along the basal plane of hcp Mg are
   approximately three times higher than those along the normal direction
   of the basal plane. The impurity diffusion coefficients of both Gd and Y
   in hcp Mg are lower than the self-diffusion of Mg and impurity
   diffusions of Al and Zn by about one order of magnitude. Growth
   constants and inter-diffusion coefficients of the intermediate phases
   for both systems were determined. Accurate thermodynamic modeling of the
   Mg Y and Mg Gd systems were also carried out based on the phase diagram
   data obtained from the present diffusion couple experiments and
   available literature data. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Title = {{Initiation and accommodation of primary twins in high-purity titanium}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{293-305}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Uniaxial compression tests were carried out at room temperature and at
   strain rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 s(-1) on samples of high-purity
   titanium. The initial texture was favorably oriented for contraction
   twinning. The double-differentiation method was employed to detect the
   initiation of twinning as well as of dynamic recrystallization. Critical
   strains of about -0.24 and -0.65 were determined, respectively, for
   these two mechanisms. The relevant mechanisms were identified by means
   of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques. At a true strain
   of epsilon = -0.3, two main kinds of primary twins, \{1 1 (2) over bar
   2\} contraction and \{1 0 (1) over bar 2\} extension, were observed and
   second-generation twins were also identified by means of the EBSD
   analysis. The presence of low Schmid factor (SF) (<0.2) twins was
   established as well as the absence of potential high SF (>0.4) twins.
   The appearance of the low SF twins is explained in terms of the low
   accommodation work required in the neighboring grains; this involves
   prismatic glide in the present case. The absence of the potential high
   SF twins, on the other hand, is justified as requiring the operation of
   a combination of several difficult deformation modes: basal glide,
   pyramidal glide, and twinning. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{Wastewater discharges may increase the populations of pathogens,
   including Escherichia coli, and of antimicrobial-resistant strains in
   receiving waters. This study investigated the impact of UV and peracetic
   acid (PAA) disinfection on the prevalence of virulence and antimicrobial
   resistance genes in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the most
   abundant E. coli pathotype in municipal wastewaters. Laboratory
   disinfection experiments were conducted on wastewater treated by
   physicochemical, activated sludge, or biofiltration processes; 1,766 E.
   coli isolates were obtained for the evaluation. The target disinfection
   level was 200 CFU/100 ml, resulting in UV and PAA doses of 7 to 30
   mJ/cm(2) and 0.9 to 2.0 mg/liter, respectively. The proportions of UPECs
   were reduced in all samples after disinfection, with an average
   reduction by UV of 55\% (range, 22\% to 80\%) and by PAA of 52\% (range,
   11\% to 100\%). Analysis of urovirulence genes revealed that the decline
   in the UPEC populations was not associated with any particular virulence
   factor. A positive association was found between the occurrence of
   urovirulence and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). However, the
   changes in the prevalence of ARGs in potential UPECs were different
   following disinfection, i.e., UV appears to have had no effect, while
   PAA significantly reduced the ARG levels. Thus, this study showed that
   both UV and PAA disinfections reduced the proportion of UPECs and that
   PAA disinfection also reduced the proportion of antimicrobial resistance
   gene-carrying UPEC pathotypes in municipal wastewaters.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{42-58}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A 3-D CFD model coupled with turbulent melt flow and heat transfer with
   solidification is developed to simulate an industrial-sized vertical
   direct chill (DC) slab caster for aluminum AA-1050 alloy. In a DC
   casting process, a melt distributor is used to feed melt to the mold to
   minimize the temperature gradient between the hottest and coldest areas.
   This study considered a new melt distributor which consisted of a
   submerged nozzle underneath of which there was a porous filter occupying
   the entire transverse cross-section of the caster. The whole assembly
   was placed inside the hot-top above the mold. Simulations were carried
   out by varying three different important parameters of the problem,
   namely, the casting speed from 40 to 100 mm/min, the effective heat
   transfer coefficient at the mold-metal contact region from 0.75 to 3.0
   kW/(m(2) K), and the Darcy number of the porous filter from 10(-6) to
   10(-3). For all parametric cases, the inlet melt superheat was 32
   degrees C and the porosity of the filter was taken as 0.4. Detail
   results in the form of velocity and temperature profiles, solid shell
   thickness, sump depth and local surface heat flux are predicted and
   compared. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{1088-1095}},

Abstract = {{NiCoCrAlY samples were fabricated via spark-plasma sintering with and
   without prior cryomilling of the as-received powder. Thermal cycling
   oxidation tests were conducted at 1000A degrees C in air for up to 200
   1-h cycles. The mass gain data indicate a notably lower mass gain for
   the cryomilled NiCoCrAlY sample. In both the conventional and cryomilled
   samples, scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction data
   indicate a single-layer oxide scale of alpha-alumina has formed, having
   undergone a transition from theta-alumina during oxidation testing.
   Spallation in the conventional sample allowed a significant amount of
   internal spinel oxide formation, and this was not found in the
   cryomilled sample. The difference in behavior is attributed to increased
   pathways for aluminum diffusion to the surface and nucleation sites for
   the alpha-alumina transition, as well as improved scale adhesion through
   nanostructuring and stress relief through the accelerated theta-alpha
   transition.}},

Abstract = {{Although the number and diversity of commercial frothers has steadily
   increased to meet flotation industry demands, frother selection is still
   mainly empirical. As part of a general structure-property study, the
   paper presents a correlation between the critical coalescence
   concentration (CCC95) and H-ratio for surfactants used as flotation
   frothers. The CCC95 were determined in 0.8 m(3) mechanical flotation
   cell. The H-ratio was a substitution of hydrophile-lipophile balance
   (HLB) and determined through high resolution proton nuclear magnetic
   resonance (H-1 NMR) spectrometry. A large data set, consisting of 45
   surfactants from four frother families, was used to develop the
   correlation. It is shown that the H-ratio can substitute for HLB. The
   potential of NMR both to identify the frother family and to derive the
   H-ratio in predicting CCC95 for commercial frothers is discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Aim: Study the shelf-life quality changes in raspberry juice with
   encapsulated lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus NRRL B-4495 and
   Lactobacillus acidophilus NRRL B-442) obtained by spray drying and
   understand the various factors involved. Methods and results: Raspberry
   powder was obtained from spray drying lactobacilli and raspberry juice
   with maltodextrin as an additive. Shelf life of the powder was analyzed
   over a period of 30 d. Acid and bile tolerance and antibiotic resistance
   was compared before and after spray drying. Water activity, survival,
   and scanning electron microscope images were also measured during the
   shelf life. Conclusions and significance: A combination of processing
   conditions: inlet temperature (degrees C), maltodextrin to juice solids
   ratio and inlet feed rate (ml/min) during spray drying had a significant
   role on the survival of lactobacilli during shelf life. Refrigerated
   storage provided a higher shelf-life stability with regards to CFU/g (as
   high as 84\% on day 0 and 98\% retention by the end of 30 d) compared to
   room temperature storage. Probiotic properties during shelf life are
   affected by the processing conditions and encapsulated food matrix.
   Thus, understanding these aspects in vitro during shelf life gives us a
   brief insight into the future of non-dairy probiotics.}},

Title = {{Development of a composite resin disclosing agent based on the

Abstract = {{Objectives: To characterize the surface composition of dental enamel and
   composite resin, assess the ability of dyes with different affinities to
   stain these surfaces, and use this information to develop a disclosing
   agent that stains composite resin more than dental enamel.
   Methods: One hundred and ten sound extracted teeth were collected and 60
   discs of composite resin, 9 mm diameter and 3 mm thick, were prepared.
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to determine the
   elemental composition on the different surfaces. A tooth shade
   spectrophotometer was used to assess the change in shade after staining
   the surfaces with different dyes.
   Results: XPS analysis revealed that surfaces of both outer dental enamel
   and composite resin contained relatively high amounts of carbon,
   specifically hydrocarbons. Both dental enamel and composite surfaces
   were stainable with the hydrophobic dye (p < 0.05); however, the
   composite resin was stained more than the dental enamel (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The hydrophobic surface of dental enamel and composite
   resin might explain their high affinity to be stained by food and
   beverages containing hydrophobic molecules. The composite resin is more
   stainable by hydrophobic dyes than dental enamel. We used this
   information to develop an agent for disclosing composite resins that
   could be used to visualize composite resins that need to be removed.
   Clinical significance: Removal of composite resin can be problematic,
   time consuming and stressful to the dental practitioner. A composite
   disclosing agent would help the dental practitioner identify the
   composite resin and facilitate its removal without damaging the adjacent
   healthy tooth tissues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Euler-Plateau problem, proposed by Giomi and Mahadevan in Proc. R.
   Soc. Lond. Ser. A, Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 468, 1851-1864 (2012), concerns
   a soap film spanning a flexible loop. The shapes of the film and the
   loop are determined by the interactions between the two components. In
   the present work, the Euler-Plateau problem is reformulated to yield a
   boundary-value problem for a vector field that parameterizes both the
   spanning surface and the bounding loop. Using the first and second
   variations of the relevant free-energy functional, detailed bifurcation
   and stability analyses are performed. For a spanning surface with energy
   density sigma and a bounding loop with length 2 pi R and flexural
   rigidity a, the first bifurcation, during which the spanning surface
   remains flat but the bounding loop becomes noncircular, occurs at R (3)
   sigma/a=3, confirming a result obtained previously via an energy
   comparison. All other bifurcation solution branches emanating from the
   flat circular solution branch, including those to nonplanar solution
   branches, are found to be unstable.}},

Abstract = {{The space elevator has been proposed as an alternate method for space
   transportation. A partial elevator is composed of a tether of several
   hundreds of kilometres, held vertically in tension between two end
   masses, with its centre of orbit placed at the geosynchronous orbit. A
   spacecraft can dock at the lower end, and then use the climber on the
   elevator to ascend to higher altitudes. In this paper, energy
   calculations are performed, to determine whether a partial elevator can
   provide sufficient savings in operational costs, compared to the
   traditional rocket-powered launch. The energy required to launch a
   spacecraft from a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to the geostationary orbit (GEO)
   is calculated for two trajectories. In the first trajectory, the
   spacecraft travels from LEO to GEO via a Hohmann transfer. In the second
   trajectory, the spacecraft travels from LEO to the lower end of the
   partial space elevator with a Hohmann transfer, and then uses the
   elevator to climb to GEO. The total energy required is compared between
   the two trajectories. The effects of tether length,
   spacecraft-to-climber mass ratio, altitude of LEO, and tether material
   are investigated. (C) 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{129-139}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we simulated the operations and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions of transit buses along a busy corridor and quantified the
   effects of two different fuels (conventional diesel and compressed
   natural gas) as well as a set of driving conditions on emissions.
   Results indicate that compressed natural gas (CNG) reduces GHG emissions
   by 8-12\% compared to conventional diesel, this reduction could increase
   to 16\% with high levels of traffic congestion. However, the benefits of
   switching from conventional diesel to CNG are less apparent when the
   road network is uncongested. We also investigated the effects of bus
   operations on emissions by applying several strategies such as transit
   signal priority (TSP), queue jumper lanes, and relocation of bus stops.
   Results show that in congested conditions, TSP alone can reduce GHG
   emissions by 14\% and when combined with improved technology; a
   reduction of 23\% is achieved. The reduction benefits are even more
   apparent when other transit operational improvements are combined with
   TSP. Finally a sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the
   effect of operational improvements on emissions under varying levels of
   network congestion. We observe that under ``extreme congestion{''}, the
   benefits of TSP decrease. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cell distribution and nutrient supply in 3D cell-laden hydrogel
   scaffolds are critical and should mimic the in vivo cellular
   environment, but been difficult to control with conventional fabrication
   methods. Here, we present a microfluidic direct writer (MFDW) to
   construct 3D cell-laden hydrogel structures with openings permitting
   media exchange. The MFDW comprises a monolithic microfluidic head, which
   delivers coaxial streams of cell-laden sodium alginate and calcium
   chloride solutions to form hydrogel fibers. Fiber diameter is controlled
   by adjusting the ratio of the volumetric flow rates. The MFDW head is
   mounted on a motorized stage, which is automatically controlled and
   moves at a speed synchronized with the speed of fiber fabrication. Head
   geometry, flow rates, and viscosity of the writing solutions were
   optimized to prevent the occurrence of curling and bulging. For
   continuous use, a highly reliable process is needed, which was
   accomplished with the integration of a declogging conduit supplying a
   solvent to dissolve the clogging gel. The MFDW was used for
   layer-by-layer fabrication of simple 3D structures with encapsulated
   cells. Assembly of 3D structures with distinct fibers is demonstrated by
   alternatively delivering two different alginate gel solutions. The MFDW
   head can be built rapidly and easily, and will allow 3D constructs for
   tissue engineering to be fabricated with multiple hydrogels and cell
   types.}},

Abstract = {{First lab-on-chip devices based on active transport by biomolecular
   motors have been demonstrated for basic detection and sorting
   applications. However, to fully employ the advantages of such hybrid
   nanotechnology, versatile spatial and temporal control mechanisms are
   required. Using a thermo-responsive polymer, we demonstrated a
   temperature controlled gate that either allows or disallows the passing
   of microtubules through a topographically defined channel. The gate is
   addressed by a narrow gold wire, which acts as a local heating element.
   It is shown that the electrical current flowing through a narrow gold
   channel can control the local temperature and as a result the
   conformation of the polymer. This is the first demonstration of a
   spatially addressable gate for microtubule motility which is a key
   element of nanodevices based on biomolecular motors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents in vivo experimental measurements of vibrations on
   the pars flaccida, along the manubrium and at several points on the pars
   tensa in the gerbil with open middle-ear cavity. The effects of
   progressive opening of the middle-ear cavity are presented, with up to
   five different extents of opening. In all manubrial, pars-tensa and
   pars-flaccida responses, opening the cavity causes an increase in the
   low-frequency magnitude and a shift of the main middle-ear resonance to
   lower frequencies and introduces an antiresonance. However, opening the
   cavity has little or no effect on either the mode of vibration of the
   manubrium or the breakup frequency of the pars tensa. When the opening
   is gradually widened, the antiresonance frequency moves to higher
   frequencies. When the opening is made as wide as anatomically possible,
   the antiresonance moves to almost 10 kHz. The main increase in the
   low-frequency response magnitude happens upon making the smallest hole
   in the cavity wall, and further progressive enlarging of the opening has
   little or no effect on the low-frequency magnitude. The antiresonance
   interferes with the response shapes. An identification method is
   suggested for eliminating the effect of the antiresonance in order to
   estimate the ideal open-cavity response. The method is validated and
   then applied to manubrial and pars-tensa responses. Estimating the ideal
   open-cavity responses will simplify comparison of the data with
   numerical models which do not include the air cavity. The data collected
   at intermediate stages of opening will be useful in validating models
   that do include the cavity.}},

   enzymatically-active product (1,4-NADH), reaching a 96\% product purity
   on Ti. The product purity was found to be highly potential-, and
   material dependant. The origin of the material/potential dependency was
   related to the strength of the metal-hydrogen (M-H-ads) bond, and thus
   to the potential dependence of the Had, electrode surface coverage. In
   contradiction to literature, bare (non-modified) metal electrodes were
   found to be good candidates for electrochemical regeneration of

Abstract = {{Log-domain Delta-Sigma () modulators are attractive for implementing
   analog-to-digital (A/D) converters (ADCs) targeting low-power
   low-voltage applications. Previously reported log-domain modulators were
   limited to 1-bit quantization and, hence, could not benefit from the
   advantages associated with multibit quantization (namely, reduced
   in-band quantization noise, and increased modulator stability). Unlike
   classical modulators, directly extending a log-domain modulator with a
   1-bit quantizer to a log-domain modulator with a multibit quantizer is
   challenging, in terms of CMOS circuit implementation. Additionally, the
   realization of log-domain modulators targeting high-resolution
   applications necessitates minimization of distortion and noise in the
   log-domain loop-filter. This paper discusses the challenges of multibit
   quantization and digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion in the log-domain,
   and presents a novel multibit log-domain modulator, practical for CMOS
   implementation. SIMULINK models of log-domain modulator circuits are
   proposed, and the effects of various circuit non-idealities are
   investigated, including the effects of log-domain compression-expansion
   mismatch. Furthermore, this paper proposes novel low-distortion
   log-domain analog blocks suitable for high-resolution analog-to-digital
   (A/D) conversion applications. Circuit simulation results of a proposed
   third-order 3-bit class AB log-domain loop-filter demonstrate 10.4-bit
   signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SNDR) over a 10 kHz bandwidth with
   a differential signal input, while operating from a 0.8 V supply and
   consuming a total power of.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate prediction of the laminar-turbulence transition process is
   fundamental in predicting the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine
   profiles. Fully turbulent flow simulations have been shown to
   over-predict the aerodynamic performance and thereby negatively
   impacting the design of airfoils in flow regimes where the possible
   presence of laminar flow could be exploited to improve the performance
   of wind turbine rotors. Correlation-based transition modelling offers a
   fully computational fluid dynamics compatible approach, where the model
   integrates completely with the existing turbulence model, allows for the
   prediction of various transition mechanisms, is applicable to
   three-dimensional flows and compatible to adjoint-based design
   optimization frameworks. The present paper addresses several
   modifications necessary for a robust transition model and investigates
   the accuracy of the model for a wide range of angles of attack and
   Reynolds numbers, which are necessary for a thorough validation of the
   correlation-based transition model for wind turbine profiles. The
   transition model was employed to predict the transition locations; and
   an assessment of the various transition mechanisms, Reynolds number
   effects, sectional characteristics and aerodynamic performance for the
   NLF(1)-0416 and S809 airfoils is presented with comparisons to

   femtosecond micromachining at a repetition rate of 10 kHz. The
   contribution of line-intensity and line-overlap on the initial
   formation, the growth and the final feature dimensions has been
   investigated. Pillow-like structures are obtained at a wide range of
   line-overlap values and at moderate intensities. Bumpy structures have
   been produced at a tighter range of overlap and at higher intensities.
   The different resulting topologies have been explained with the
   existence of two different thermal ablation regimes. The simulation of
   the resulting intensity profiles has shown that homogenous pillow-like
   structures are obtained at a flat intensity profile, while homogenous
   bumpy structures are produced with a wavy profile. The effective beam
   diameter has to be determined visually from the width of a single line.
   Then the line-overlap is calculated based on the effective beam diameter
   to achieve homogenous structures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A simulated study including 6 soil management treatments was conducted
   in 2011 and 2012 to evaluate impacts of ground cover on soil moisture
   and slope runoff in a pear-jujube (Ziziphus jujube Mill.) orchard.
   Treatments were (1) strip cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L) cover (SCF),
   (2) strip crown vetch (Coronilla varia L) cover (SCV), (3) strip
   birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L) cover (SBF), (4) strip white
   clover (Trifolium repens L.) cover (SWC), (5) full white clover cover
   (WCC) and (6) control (clean cultivation) (CC). Results showed that, the
   2-year mean infiltration water amount after rain was significantly
   higher under vegetation cover treatments than under CC (P < 0.05), and
   significantly greater under WCC than under strip vegetation cover
   treatments (P < 0.05, except for SCF). The runoff volume and sediment
   yield were significantly larger under CC than under other treatments (P
   < 0.05). The daily water consumption under WCC and CC was larger than
   other treatments. The mean soil moisture was significantly higher under
   SCF than under others (P < 0.05). Significant differences were found
   between the grass and legume covers (P < 0.05). The cocksfoot was
   considered as the best choice as a ground cover in pear-jujube orchards

Abstract = {{Membrane flexoelectricity is an electromechanical coupling process that
   describes membrane bending and membrane electrical polarization caused
   by bending under electric fields. In this paper we propose, formulate,
   and characterize a stress-sensor device for mechanically loaded solids,
   consisting of a soft flexoelectric thin membrane attached to the loaded
   deformed solid. Because the curvature of the deformed solid is
   transferred to the attached flexoelectric membrane, the
   electromechanical transduction of the latter produces a charge that is
   proportional to the stress of the solid. The model of the stress-sensor
   device is based on the integration of the thermodynamics of polarizable
   membranes with isotropic solid elasticity, leading to a transfer
   function that identifies the elastic, electromechanical, and geometrical
   parameters involved in electrical-signal generation. The model is
   applied to representative normal bending and then to more complex
   off-axis bending of elastic bars. In all cases, a common transfer
   function shows the generic material and its geometric contributions. The
   sensor sensitivity increases linearly with flexoelectricity and the
   membrane-solid interface, and the sensitivity decreases with increasing
   membrane thickness and Youngs modulus of the solid. The theoretical
   results contribute to ongoing experimental efforts towards the
   development of anisotropic soft-matter-based stress-sensor devices
   through solid-membrane interactions and electromechanical transduction.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafine NiCoCrAlY samples have been obtained through cryomilling of
   NiCoCrAlY feedstock powder and sintering via SPS, these samples have
   been subjected to isothermal oxidation tests at 950, 1000 and 1050
   degrees C. Oxidation rates on the order of 10(-13) g(2)/cm(4)/s for
   samples oxidized at 950 degrees C, 10(-11) g(2)/cm(4)/s at 1000 degrees
   C and 10(-12)g(2)/cm(4)/s at 1050 degrees C have been found. In all
   cases cryomilled samples demonstrate lower overall oxidation rates than
   their conventional counterparts. Lower overall oxidation rates found in
   the cryomilled samples are ascribed to an earlier transition trough the
   metastable alumina phases, resulting in a stable slow growing
   alpha-Al2O3. Characterization by XRD and SEM corresponds well with this
   assessment. Lower oxidation rates seen at 1050 than at 1000 degrees C in
   both conventional and cryomilled samples is the result of a change from
   oxidation dominated by theta-alumina to oxidation dominated by
   alpha-alumina, as the theta-alpha transition speeds up with increasing
   temperature. This change in oxidation regime reduces, but does not
   eliminate, the beneficial impact of smaller grain size on oxidation
   rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Applying surface coatings on a biomedical implant is a promising
   modification technique which can enhance the implant's biocompatibility
   via controlling blood constituents- or/and cell-surface interaction. In
   this study, the influence of composition of IrxTi1-x-oxide coatings (x =
   0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) formed on a titanium (Ti) substrate on the
   responses of platelets, endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells
   (SMCs) was investigated. The results showed that a significant decrease
   in platelet adhesion and activation was obtained on Ir0.2Ti0.8-oxide and
   Ir0.4Ti0.6-oxide coatings, rendering the surfaces more blood compatible,
   in comparison to the control (316L stainless steel, 316L-SS) and other
   coating compositions. Further, a substantial increase in the EC/SMC
   surface count ratio after 4 h of cell attachment to the Ir0.2Ti0.8-oxide
   and Ir0.4Ti0.6-oxide coatings, relative to the 316L-SS control and the
   other coating compositions, indicated high potential of these coatings
   for the enhancement of surface endothelialization. This indicates the
   capability of the corresponding coating compositions to promote EC
   proliferation on the surface, while inhibiting that of SMCs, which is
   important in cardiovascular stents applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Prediction and innovative control strategies for oxygen and hazardous
   gases from diesel emission in underground mines}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{481}},
Pages = {{317-334}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Diesel engine is widely used in underground mining machines due to its
   efficiency, ease of maintenance, reliability and durability. However, it
   possesses significant danger to the miners and mining operations as it
   releases hazardous gases (CO, NO, CO2) and fine particles which can be
   easily inhaled by the miners. Moreover, the diesel engine consumes
   significant amount of oxygen which can lead to insufficient oxygen
   supply for miners. It is therefore critical to maintain sufficient
   oxygen supply while keeping hazardous gas concentrations from diesel
   emission below the maximum allowable level. The objective of this study
   is to propose and to examine various innovative ventilation strategies
   to control oxygen and hazardous gas concentrations in underground mine
   to ensure safety, productivity and cost related to energy consumption.
   Airflow distribution, oxygen and hazardous gas dispersion as well as
   ambient temperature within the mining area are evaluated by utilizing
   the well-established computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The
   results suggest that our newly proposed ventilation design performs
   better as compared to the conventional design to handle hazardous gases
   from diesel emission. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{113-124}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{A comparative study of syngas and biogas fuel blends, comprising of CH4,
   H-2, CO, and CO2, is conducted to validate current natural gas kinetics
   models and to assess nitric oxide (NO) production from prompt, thermal,
   NNH, and N2O formation routes. Experiments are conducted at
   atmospheric-pressure in jet-wall stagnation flames over fuel-air
   equivalence ratios of 0.7 less than or similar to phi less than or
   similar to 1.4. Measurements of flame burning rate are made using
   Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), and NO formation is measured using
   Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF), whereby absolute NO
   concentrations are calibrated using known seeding levels. The resulting
   experimental profiles are directly compared to numerical simulations of
   stagnation flames in order to evaluate the predictive capabilities of
   several chemical kinetic models: GRI-Mech 3.0, GDF-Kin NCN 3.0, CRECK
   (Version 1212), and Konnov 0.6. It is found that, within the range of
   experimental uncertainty, no model is able to provide acceptable
   predictions over all tested conditions for both NO formation and burning
   rate. GRI-Mech 3.0, CRECK (Version 1212), and Konnov 0.6 under-predict
   burning rate in fuels with significant H-2 and CO concentration and
   generally over-predict emissions by more than 50\% for the studied
   conditions, while GDF-Kin 3.0 increasingly over-predicts flame
   reactivity and burning rate with increasing CH4 composition, but
   performs the best for NO predictions. The comparative nature of the
   study also allows for a direct comparison of the NO emission
   characteristics of the fuels, which shows that the primary NO formation
   routes are both thermal and prompt in biogas flames and only thermal for
   syngas; however, NNH and N2O routes have considerable influence at lean
   equivalence ratios for all fuels considered. Finally, these fuel blends
   are shown to produce lower levels of NO than methane when compared at
   equivalent thermal power levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   that by the introduction of periodic design the critical velocities can
   be raised over several desired ranges of the dimensionless fluid density

   optimal experiments and re-estimation of reactivity ratios and

   practice for determining reactivity ratios with the highest possible
   level of confidence. The performance of this framework is verified

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms, a growing problem in many of
   Quebec and Ontario's lakes and rivers, are largely attributed to the
   phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) emanating from intensively cropped
   agricultural fields. In fact, 49\% of N loading in surface waters comes
   from runoff and leaching from fertilized soils and livestock operations.
   The residual soil nitrogen (RSN), which remains in soil at the end of
   the growing season, contains soluble and particulate forms of N that are
   prone to being transported from agricultural fields to waterways.
   Policies and best management practices (BMPs) to regulate manure storage
   and restrict fertilizer and manure spreading can help in reducing N
   losses from agroecosystems. However, reduction of RSN also requires an
   understanding of the complex interactions between climate, soil type,
   topography, hydrology and cropping systems. Reducing N losses from
   agroecosystems can be achieved through careful accounting for all N
   inputs (e. g., N credits for legumes and manure inputs) in nutrient
   management plans, including those applied in previous years, as well as
   the strategic implementation of multiple BMPs and calibrated soil N
   testing for crops with high N requirements. We conclude that increasing
   farmer awareness and motivation to implement BMPs will be important in
   reducing RSN. Programs to promote communication between farmers and
   researchers, crop advisors and provincial ministries of agriculture and
   the environment are recommended.}},

   fundamental tree algorithm, and Seymour's parameterized pit algorithm
   are examined to see how they can be used to produce pushback designs and
   how they address gap issues. Areas of current and future research on
   producing pushbacks with a constrained size to help eliminate gap
   problems are discussed. A framework for incorporating discounting at the
   time of pushback design is proposed, which can lead to mine designs with
   increased NPV.}},

   three different flotation collectors (benzohydroxamic acid, sodium

   experiments and with bubble-particle attachment pictures. The
   investigated properties of allanite were compared to those of quartz, a
   common gangue mineral in many RE deposits. The results of this work
   indicated that only dodecylamine was able to achieve a selective

Abstract = {{Ferrous iron (Fe(II)) is usually present in a considerable amount in
   acidic hydrometallurgical effluents. However, little is known about its
   role on arsenate (As(V)) precipitation during ambient temperature
   neutralization. This work investigated the precipitation behaviour of
   As(V) during hydrolysis of ferrous sulfate solutions in both batch and
   continuous modes. In the batch mode experiments, the pH of acidic
   ferrous sulfate solution with and without the presence of As(V) was
   raised from 1.6 up to 11.5 by the addition of NaOH or CaO. In the
   absence of As(V). Fe(II) ions started to precipitate out of solution at
   similar to pH 7 and were completely removed at similar to pH 8.5 as
   ferrous hydroxide, whereas in the presence of As(V), rapid precipitation
   of Fe(II) occurred at > -pH 4 accompanied by simultaneous removal of
   As(V) with the latter almost completely precipitated at > - pH 5.5. This
   indicates strong association of Fe(II) with As(V) in the precipitates.
   Elemental analysis after digestion of the Fe(ll)-As(V) precipitates
   yielded Fe(II)/As(V) molar ratios similar to that of symplesite
   (Fe-3(AsO4)(2).8H(2)0). During the steady state regime of the 2-stage
   continuous coprecipitation/treatment of an acidic Fe(ll)-As(V) solution
   (Fe(II)/As(V) = 4), with the first and second reactor pH kept constant
   at 6 and 8 respectively, the majority of As(V) was found to precipitate
   in the first reactor together with ferrous iron at an Fe(II)/As(V) molar
   ratio close to that of symplesite. These results imply that ferrous iron
   is an important contributor to arsenic (V) removal/precipitation and
   should be taken into account in the treatment of arsenic-bearing
   hydrometallurgical effluents and disposal of produced coprecipitated
   solids. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the average throughput and the outage probability for
   relay-based incremental redundancy HARQ transmission over block fading
   channel. We focus on the effects of having an error-free multi-bit
   feedback channel instead of the single-bit ACK/NACK feedback used in
   conventional HARQ. This multi-bit feedback message provides the
   cooperating nodes with outdated channel state information (CSI) so that
   they can adapt their transmission rate. We discuss a network with M
   relay nodes and assume adaptive transmission rate for all the
   cooperating nodes. We describe the adaptation problem as a Markov
   Decision Process (MDP) and employ the Dynamic Programming (DP) for
   optimization. The numerical results obtained in the case of one relay
   transmission, indicate that significant throughput gains can be obtained
   when compared to non-adaptive, i.e, fixed-rate HARQ. Moreover, we study
   the performance limits of the system model by finding an upper bound of
   the throughput for the cooperative HARQ channel which is applicable to
   both adaptive and non-adaptive models. Finally, we analyze the
   discretization issues and conclude that only a small number of feedback
   bits is required by the adaptive system to outperform the conventional
   single-bit HARQ.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of channel estimation for OFDM-based
   amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relay networks (TWRNs). While previous
   works have adopted a pilot-based approach, we propose a semi-blind
   approach that exploits both the transmitted pilots as well as the
   received data samples to improve the estimation performance. Our
   proposed semi-blind estimator is based on the Gaussian maximum
   likelihood (GML) criterion which treats that data symbols as
   Gaussian-distributed nuisance parameters. The GML estimates are obtained
   using an iterative quasi-Newton method. To assist in the estimation of
   the individual channels, we adopt a superimposed training strategy at
   the relay. We design the pilot vectors of the terminals and the relay to
   optimize the estimation performance. Furthermore, we derive the
   semi-blind and pilot-based Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) to use as
   performance benchmarks. Finally, we use simulation studies to show that
   the proposed method provides substantial improvements in estimation
   accuracy over the conventional pilot-based estimation and that it
   approaches the semi-blind CRB as SNR increases. These improvements are
   possible using only a limited number of OFDM data blocks, which
   demonstrates the practicality of the semi-blind approach.}},

Abstract = {{Designing a safe and efficient gene delivery system is required for
   success of gene therapy trials. Although a wide variety of viral,
   non-viral and polymeric nanoparticle based careers have been widely
   studied, the current gene delivery vehicles are limited by their
   suboptimal, non-specific therapeutic efficacy and acute immunological
   reactions, leading to unwanted side effects. Recently, there has been a
   growing interest in insect-cell-originated baculoviruses as gene
   delivery vehicles for diverse biomedical applications. Specifically, the
   emergence of diverse types of surface functionalized and bioengineered
   baculoviruses is posed to edge over currently available gene delivery
   vehicles. This is primarily because baculoviruses are comparatively
   non-pathogenic and non-toxic as they cannot replicate in mammalian cells
   and do not invoke any cytopathic effect. Moreover, emerging advanced
   studies in this direction have demonstrated that hybridizing the
   baculovirus surface with different kinds of bioactive therapeutic
   molecules, cell-specific targeting moieties, protective polymeric grafts
   and nanomaterials can significantly improve the preclinical efficacy of
   baculoviruses. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the
   recent advancements in the field of bioengineering and biotherapeutics
   to engineer baculovirus hybrids for tailored gene therapy, and
   articulates in detail the potential and challenges of these strategies
   for clinical realization. In addition, the article illustrates the rapid
   evolvement of microfluidic devices as a high throughput platform for
   optimizing baculovirus production and treatment conditions. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Blower and exhaust fans consume over 30\% of electricity in a thermal
   power plant, and faults of these fans due to rotation stalls are one of
   the most frequent reasons for power plant outage failures. To accurately
   predict the occurrence of fan rotation stalls, we propose a support
   vector regression machine (SVRM) model that predicts the fan internal
   pressures during operation, leaving ample time for rotation stall
   detection. We train the SVRM model using experimental data samples, and
   perform pressure data prediction using the trained SVRM model. To prove
   the feasibility of using the SVRM model for rotation stall prediction,
   we further process the predicted pressure data via
   wavelet-transform-based stall detection. By comparison of the detection
   results from the predicted and measured pressure data, we demonstrate
   that the SVRM model can accurately predict the fan pressure and
   guarantee reliable stall detection with a time advance of up to 0.0625
   s. This superior pressure data prediction capability leaves significant
   time for effective control and prevention of fan rotation stall faults.
   This model has great potential for use in intelligent fan systems with
   stall prevention capability, which will ensure safe operation and
   improve the energy efficiency of power plants.}},

Abstract = {{This study determined iodine value (IV) and free fatty acids (FFA)
   content of four different animal fat wastes and their blends using
   Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR). Chemometric
   analysis by partial least squares (PIS) regression was used to correlate
   spectral data with IV and FFA reference values of the samples. The
   effects of four spectra pre-processing (first derivative (FD), second
   derivative (SD), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) and vector
   normalization (VN)) methods were investigated to predict the
   reproducibility and robustness of the PLS-NIR model developed. A set of
   70\% of animal fat wastes and their blends were used for developing PLS
   calibration models for measuring IV and FFA content using the remaining
   30\% samples as an independent test set validation. The coefficient of
   determination (R-2), the root mean square error estimation (RMSEE), and
   the residual prediction deviation (RPD) were used as indicators for the
   predictability of the PLS models. PLS-NIR models developed using first
   derivative and second derivative spectral preprocessing methods were the
   best for both IV and FFA content analysis (For IV, FD; R-2 = 0.9870,
   RMSEE = 1.40 gI(2)/100 g, RPD = 8.76, SD; R-2 = 0.9892, RMSEE = 1.28
   gI(2)/100 g, RPD = 9.64 while For FFA, FD; R-2 = 0.9991, RMSEE =
   0.195\%, RPD = 34.00, SD; R-2 = 0.9993, RMSEE = 0.182\%, RPD = 36.8).
   Overall, the results of this study demonstrate the suitability of FT-NIR
   spectroscopy for the quality control analysis of feedstocks for
   biodiesel production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The targeted and effective delivery of therapeutic agents remains an
   unmet goal in the field of controlled release systems. Magnetococcus
   marinus MC-1 magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are investigated as potential
   therapeutic carriers. By combining directional
   magnetotaxis-microaerophilic control of these self-propelled agents, a
   larger amount of therapeutics can be delivered surpassing the diffusion
   limits of large drug molecules toward hard-to-treat hypoxic regions in
   solid tumors. The potential benefits of these carriers emphasize the
   need to develop an adequate method to attach therapeutic cargos, such as
   drug-loaded nanoliposomes, without substantially affecting the cell's
   ability to act as delivery agents. In this study, we report on a
   strategy for the attachment of liposomes to MTB (MTB-LP) through
   carbodiimide chemistry. The attachment efficacy, motility, and magnetic
   response of the MTB-LP were investigated. Results confirm that a
   substantial number of nanoliposomes (similar to 70) are efficiently
   linked with MTB without compromising functionality and motility.
   Cytotoxicity assays using three different cell types (J774, NIH/3T3, and
   Colo205) reveal that liposomal attachments to MTB formulation improve
   the biocompatibility of MTB, whereas attachment does not Interfere with
   liposomal uptake.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The design, construction, operation and validation of a
   wall-shear-stress sensor, and measurements obtained using this sensor in
   air flows downstream of partial blockages in a mini-channel are
   presented. The sensor consisted of a hot wire mounted over a small
   rectangular slot and operated using a constant-temperature anemometer.
   It was used to investigate flows similar to those within the
   mini-channels inside notebook computers. The overall goal of the present
   work was to develop a sensor suitable for measurements of the wall-shear
   stress in such flows, which can be used to validate corresponding
   numerical simulations, as the latter are known to be often surprisingly
   inaccurate. To this end, measurements of the wall-shear stress, and the
   corresponding statistical moments and power spectral densities, were
   obtained at different distances downstream of the partial blockage, with
   blockage ratios of 39.7, 59.2, and 76.3 \%. The Reynolds number (based
   on average velocity and hydraulic diameter) ranged from 100 to 900. The
   results confirmed the presence of unsteadiness, separation,
   reattachment, and laminar-turbulent transition in the ostensibly laminar
   flow of air in mini-channels with partial blockages. The present results
   demonstrate why accurate numerical predictions of cooling air flows in
   laptop and notebook computers remain a challenging task.}},

Abstract = {{Multicore platforms are increasingly used in real-time embedded
   applications. In control systems, including automotive, avionics, and
   automation, resources shared by tasks on different cores need to be
   protected by mechanisms that guarantee access in a mutually exclusive
   way with bounded worst case blocking time. The evaluation of the
   tradeoffs among the possible protocols for mutual exclusion requires an
   estimate of their implementation overheads. In this paper, we summarize
   the possible protection mechanisms and provide code implementations in
   real-time operating systems executing on a multicore platform. We
   discuss the tradeoffs among the different mechanisms based on
   experimental evaluation of their memory and timing overheads as well as
   their impact on system schedulability. We propose a heuristic algorithm
   to select the optimal combination of mechanisms for shared resources in
   systems with time constraints to minimize their memory requirements. The
   effectiveness of the optimization procedure is demonstrated by synthetic
   systems as well as industrial case studies.}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a general method to analyze the achievable
   rate and to characterize the optimal power-allocation (PA) scheme for a
   wide range of half-duplex single-relay amplify-and-forward (AF)
   protocols over Rayleigh fading channels in high and low
   signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regimes. These include one-way (OW) dual-hop
   AF (DHAF) systems, OW nonorthogonal AF (NAF) systems, and two-phase
   two-way AF (2P TWAF) systems using either fixed-gain (FG) or
   variable-gain (VG) amplification coefficients. At high-SNR regimes, our
   main idea is to exploit the capacity of a two-branch maximal-ratio
   combining (MRC) system to obtain tight yet simple approximations to the
   achievable rates. In low-SNR regions, we use a simple approximation to
   the logarithm to compute the asymptotic achievable rates. For all
   considered AF protocols, the closed-form approximations are tight and
   easy to analyze since they involve only the exponential integral. Then,
   using the derived approximations, we analytically quantify the
   asymptotic PA schemes among the nodes to achieve the maximum rate and
   the sum rate for OW and TW schemes, respectively. The OW and TW
   protocols of interest are finally compared with the direct transmission
   (DT) scheme. Although OW relaying is inferior in terms of capacity in
   high-and low-SNR regimes, the 2P TW system might become advantageous in
   terms of sum-rate performance at high SNRs under the right channel
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Otoacoustic emissions in newborn hearing screening: A systematic review
   of the effects of different protocols on test outcomes}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{711-717}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Otoacoustic emission (OAE) tests are
   currently used to screen newborns for congenital hearing loss in many
   Universal Newborn Hearing Screening programs. However, there are
   concerns about high referral and false-positive rates. Various protocols
   have been used to address this problem. The main objective of this
   review is to determine the effects of different screening protocols on
   the referral rates and positive predictive values (PPV) of the OAE
   newborn screening test.
   Methods: Eligible studies published in English from January 1990 until
   August 2012 were identified through searches of MEDLINE, Medline
   In-Process, Embase, PubMed (NCBI), ISI Web of Science, and the Cochrane
   Central Register of clinical controlled trials. Two reviewers
   independently screened the data sources, using pre-defined inclusion
   criteria to generate a list of eligible articles. Data extracted
   included the number of newborns screened, age at screening, OAE pass
   criteria, frequencies screened, number of retests, referral rates, and
   the number of newborns identified with permanent congenital hearing
   loss.
   Results: Ten articles met the inclusion criteria, with a total of
   119,714 newborn participants. The pooled referral rate was 5.5\%.
   Individual referral rates ranged from 13\% to 39\%; the PPV from 2 to
   40\%. Increasing the age at initial screening and performing retests
   reduced the referral rate. Likewise, screenings involving higher
   frequencies had lower referral rates.
   Conclusion: Delaying newborn hearing screening improves test results but
   may not be practical in all contexts. The use of higher frequencies and
   more sophisticated OAE devices may be useful approaches to ensure better
   performance of the OAE test in newborn hearing screening. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Objectives This study sought to determine the efficacy of low rate
   fluoroscopy at 7.5 frames/s (FPS) versus conventional 15 FPS for
   reduction of operator and patient radiation dose during diagnostic
   coronary angiography (DCA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
   via the transradial approach (TRA).
   Background TRA for cardiac catheterization is potentially associated
   with increased radiation exposure. Low rate fluoroscopy has the
   potential to reduce radiation exposure.
   Methods Patients undergoing TRA diagnostic angiography +/- ad-hoc PCI
   were randomized to fluoroscopy at 7.5 FPS versus 15 FPS prior to the
   procedure. Both 7.5 and 15 FPS fluoroscopy protocols were configured
   with a fixed dose per pulse of 40 nGy. Primary endpoints were operator
   radiation dose (measured with dosimeter attached to the left side of the
   thyroid shield in mu Sievert {[}mu Sv]), patient radiation dose
   (expressed as dose-area product in Gy.cm(2)), and fluoroscopy time.
   Results From October 1, 2012 to August 30, 2013, from a total of 363
   patients, 184 underwent DCA and 179 underwent PCI. Overall, fluoroscopy
   at 7.5 FPS compared with 15 FPS was associated with a significant
   reduction in operator dose (30\% relative reduction {[}RR], p < 0.0001);
   and in patient's dose-area product (19\% RR; p = 0.022). When stratified
   by procedure type, 7.5 FPS compared with 15 FPS was associated with
   significant reduction in operator dose during both DCA (40\% RR; p <
   0.0001) and PCI (28\% RR; p = 0.0011). Fluoroscopy at 7.5 FPS, compared
   with 15 FPS, was also associated with substantial reduction in patients'
   dose-area product during DCA (26\% RR; p = 0.0018) and during PCI (19\%
   RR; p = 0.13). Fluoroscopy time was similar in 7.5 FPS and 15 FPS groups
   for DCA (3.4 +/- 2.0 min vs. 4.0 +/- 4.7 min; p = 0.42) and PCI (11.9
   +/- 8.4 min vs. 13.3 +/- 9.7 min; p = 0.57), respectively.
   Conclusions Fluoroscopy at 7.5 FPS, compared with 15 FPS, is a simple
   and effective method in reducing operator and patient radiation dose
   during TRA DCA and PCI. (C) 2014 by the American College of Cardiology

Abstract = {{Electrochemical removal of biofilms deserves attention because of its
   ease of use and environmentally friendly nature. We investigated the
   influence of electrode potential and treatment time on the removal of a
   10-day old Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formed on stainless steel 316L
   substrates. At electrode potentials more positive than -1.5 V vs.
   Ag/AgCL lower removal rates were observed and only partial removal of
   the biofilm was achieved during a 1-min time interval. Electrostatic
   repulsion between the film and electrode surface is believed to drive
   biofilm detachment under these conditions. However, when the
   biofilm-coated substrates were treated at potentials negative of -1.5 V
   vs. Ag/AgCI, complete removal of a biofilm was achieved within seconds.
   Under these conditions, vigorous evolution of hydrogen gas is believed
   to be responsible for the film removal, mechanically detaching the
   bacteria and extracellular polymeric matrix from the substrate.
   Stainless steel substrates were also subjected to repeated cycles of
   biofilm formation and electrochemical removal. High removal efficiencies
   were maintained throughout this process suggesting the potential of the
   proposed technology for application on conductive surfaces in various
   industrial settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{117}},

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Bactericidal filter papers offer the simplicity of gravity filtration to
   simultaneously eradicate microbial contaminants and particulates. We
   previously detailed the development of biocidal block copolymer micelles
   that could be immobilized on a filter paper to actively eradicate
   bacteria. Despite the many advantages offered by this system, its
   widespread use is hindered by its unknown mechanism of action which can
   result in non-reproducible outcomes. In this work, we sought to
   investigate the mechanism by which a certain percentage of Escherichia
   coli cells survived when passing through the bactericidal filter paper.
   Through the process of elimination, the possibility that the bacterial
   survival probability was controlled by the initial bacterial load or the
   existence of resistant sub-populations of E. coli was dismissed. It was
   observed that increasing the thickness or the number of layers of the
   filter significantly decreased bacterial survival probability for the
   biocidal filter paper but did not affect the efficiency of the blank
   filter paper (no biocide). The survival probability of bacteria passing
   through the antibacterial filter paper appeared to depend strongly on
   the number of collision between each bacterium and the biocide-loaded
   micelles. It was thus hypothesized that during each collision a certain
   number of biocide molecules were directly transferred from the
   hydrophobic core of the micelle to the bacterial lipid bilayer membrane.
   Therefore, each bacterium must encounter a certain number of collisions
   to take up enough biocide to kill the cell and cells that do not undergo
   the threshold number of collisions are expected to survive. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The present work reports, for the first time, the synthesis and
   characterization of canola protein-based hydrogels. These hydrogels were
   synthesized by solution based graft copolymerization of acrylic acid
   monomers on the canola protein backbones in the presence of a
   crosslinker (N,N'-methylenebis (acrylymide)) and initiators (sodium
   bisulfite and potassium persulfate). The grafting was confirmed by means
   of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The contributions of the
   crosslinker, initiator and neutralization degree to the hydrogel were
   investigated by applying differential scanning calorimetry,
   thermogravimetric analysis, swelling test, scanning electron microscope.
   The macromolecules exhibited extraordinary water absorbency capacity in
   distilled water. The highest equilibrium swelling of hydrogel in
   distilled water reached 448 g/g of hydrogel in 48 h. The swelling
   properties of the optimized hydrogel were also studied at various pH and
   saline concentrations. The hydrogels responded spontaneously to these
   changes, which may confer them the title of smart materials. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The continuous spectrum is a unique representation of the linear
   viscoelastic behavior of a polymer that reveals aspects of its behavior
   that may not be obvious in plots of the storage and loss moduli. A
   spectrum can in principle be inferred from experimental data, but
   because data are always corrupted by random error, this is one of the
   several ill-posed problems that arise in rheology {[}Honerkamp, J.,
   Rheol. Acta 28, 363-371 (1989) and Malkin, A. Ya., Rheol. Acta 29,
   512-518 (1990)], and this throws into doubt the possibility of obtaining
   a unique relaxation spectrum. A number of methods have been proposed to
   overcome the ill-posedness of the problem to arrive at a unique
   continuous spectrum that is a characteristic of the material. Wider use
   of these methods has been limited by the fact that many of them are the
   work of mathematicians or physicists who use languages and symbols not
   readily intelligible to rheologists and that the codes required to
   implement them are not readily available. For these reasons, continuous
   spectra are rarely reported. We demonstrate and compare the use of one,
   well-established method as well two recent ones using both simulated and
   actual data and provide advice to polymer rheologists as to the
   feasibility of inferring a meaningful continuous spectrum from data. We
   also evaluate the method of Baumgaertel and Winter {[}J. Non-Newtonian
   Fluid Mech. 44, 15-36 (1992)] for obtaining a discrete spectrum that is
   useful for calculating material functions and for flow simulation. We
   recommend that reports of viscoelastic behavior include plots of this
   revealing material function. (C) 2014 The Society of Rheology.}},

Title = {{Warming impact on energy use of HVAC system in buildings of different
   thermal qualities and in different climates}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{106-111}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In order to combat climate change, energy use in the building must be
   further reduced. Heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems
   in residential buildings account for considerable fraction of global
   energy consumption. The potential contribution the domestic sector can
   make in reducing energy consumption is recognized worldwide.
   The driving energy of HVACs depends on the thermal quality of the
   building envelope (TQBE) and outside temperature. Definitely, building
   regulations are changing with the time toward reduce the thermal loads
   of buildings. However, most of the existing residential buildings were
   built to lower TQBE. For instant, 72\% of residential dwellings in the
   15-EU were built before 1972.
   To investigate the impact of warming on driving energy of HVACs of a
   residential building a computer model was developed. Three climate
   categories/cities were considered, i.e. Stockholm (cold), Istanbul
   (mild), and Doha (hot). In each city, two buildings were modeled: one
   was assumed to be built according to the current local buildings
   regulations (standard TQBE), while the anther was built to lower TQBE.
   The simulations were run for present and future (in 2050) outdoor
   designing conditions.
   The calculations show that the impact of the warming on annual driving
   energy of HVACs (reduction or increase) depends very much on the climate
   category and on the TQBE. Based on the climate and TQBE, the change in
   annual HVACs energy varies from -7.4\% (in cold climate) to 12.7\% (in
   hot climate). In mild climate, it was shown that the warming does not
   have significant impact on annual HVACs energy. Improving the TQBE can
   mitigate the impact of the warming. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   fabrication process of 3D-mu PADs. This technique, evolved from the
   popular wax-printing technique for paper channel patterning, is capable
   of controlling the penetration depth of melted wax, printed on both
   sides of a paper substrate, and thus forming multilayers of patterned
   channels in the substrate. We control two fabrication parameters, the
   density of printed wax (i.e., grayscale level of printing) and the
   heating time, to adjust the penetration depth of wax upon heating.
   Through double-sided printing of patterns at different grayscale levels
   and proper selection of the heating time, we construct up to four layers
   of channels in a 315.4-mu m-thick sheet of paper. As a proof-of-concept
   demonstration, we fabricate a 3D-mu PAD with three layers of channels
   from a paper substrate and demonstrate multiplexed enzymatic detection
   of three biomarkers (glucose, lactate, and uric acid). This technique is
   also compatible with the conventional fabrication techniques of 3D-mu
   PADs, and can decrease the number of paper layers required for forming a
   3D-mu PAD and therefore make the device quality control easier. This
   technique holds a great potential to further popularize the use of 3D-mu
   PADs and enhance the mass-production quality of these devices.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the first experimental demonstration of the thermal control
   of coupling strength between a rolled-up microtube and a waveguide on a
   silicon electronic-photonic integrated circuit. The microtubes are
   fabricated by selectively releasing a coherently strained GaAs/InGaAs
   heterostructure bilayer. The fabricated microtubes are then integrated
   with silicon waveguides using an abruptly tapered fiber probe. By tuning
   the gap between the microtube and the waveguide using localized heaters,
   the microtube-waveguide evanescent coupling is effectively controlled.
   With heating, the extinction ratio of a microtube whispering-gallery
   mode changes over an 18 dB range, while the resonant wavelength remains
   approximately unchanged. Utilizing this dynamic thermal tuning effect,
   we realize coupling modulation of the microtube integrated with the
   silicon waveguide at 2 kHz with a heater voltage swing of 0-6 V. (C)

Abstract = {{Potential Earth impact hazards posed by near Earth objects have
   motivated researchers to propose hazard mitigation techniques to deflect
   the near Earth objects from their Earth-crossing orbits. There are
   several methods suggested in the literature to perturb the motion of a
   near Earth object, ranging from the nuclear explosions to the use of
   solar sails and direct impact. One of the effective nonnuclear
   techniques is the attachment of a tether and ballast to the asteroid to
   alter its trajectory; hence, in this paper, the effect of attaching a
   tether and ballast mass to the asteroid and then cutting the tether at
   an appropriate time is investigated. The instant of cutting the tether
   is of crucial importance and is determined via the simulated annealing
   optimization technique. The dynamic characteristics of the optimum
   tether cut point are also studied in this paper. It is shown that there
   exist only a few candidates for the optimum tether cut time.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a superfamily of transcription factors
   central to regulating many biological processes, including cell growth,
   death, metabolism, and immune responses. NR-mediated gene expression can
   be modulated by coactivators and corepressors through direct physical
   interaction or protein complexes with functional domains in NRs. One
   class of these domains includes short linear motifs (SLiMs), which
   facilitate protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, and ligand
   binding primarily in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of
   proteins. Across all proteins, the number of known SLiMs is limited due
   to the difficulty in studying IDRs experimentally. Computational tools
   provide a systematic and data-driven approach for predicting functional
   motifs that can be used to prioritize experimental efforts. Accordingly,
   several tools have been developed based on sequence conservation or
   biophysical features; however, discrepancies in predictions make it
   difficult to determine the true candidate SLiMs. In this work, we
   present the ensemble predictor for short linear motifs (EPSLiM), a novel
   strategy to prioritize the residues that are most likely to be SLiMs in
   IDRs. EPSLiM applies a generalized linear model to integrate predictions
   from individual methodologies. We show that EPSLiM outperforms
   individual predictors, and we apply our method to NRs. The androgen
   receptor is an example with an N-terminal domain of 559 disordered amino
   acids that contains several validated SLiMs important for
   transcriptional activation. We use the androgen receptor to illustrate
   the predictive performance of EPSLiM and make the results of all human
   and mouse NRs publically available through the web service
   http://epslim.bwh.harvard.edu.}},

   Our study is set in Montreal, Canada where a traffic simulation model
   for a dense urban neighborhood is extended with capabilities for
   microscopic emission estimation. The results indicate that on average,
   isolated calming measures increase carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide
   (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by 1.5, 0.3, and 1.5 \%,
   respectively across the entire network. Area-wide schemes result in a
   percentage increase of 3.8 \% for CO2, 1.2 \% for CO, and 2.2 \% for NOx
   across the entire network. Along specific corridors where traffic
   calming measures were simulated, increases in emissions of up to 83 \%
   were observed. We also account for the effect of different measures on
   traffic volumes and observe moderate decreases in areas that have
   undergone traffic calming. In spite of traffic flow reductions, total

Abstract = {{An algorithm is used to estimate mesoscopic strains in a deformed

   estimate the local/mesoscopic strains from the displacements of

   lightly plane strain compressed (PSC) polycrystalline zirconium. Very
   large (up to 1.2) near-boundary mesoscopic shear strains were estimated.
   These were well above the estimated measurement uncertainties and
   remarkably larger than the extremely small (0.01-0.04) PSC strains
   imposed. Opposing local shears, on both sides of a grain boundary,
   appeared to compensate each other. Direct correlations were noted, in
   the same grain, between mesoscopic shear strains and (i) in-grain
   misorientations and (ii) subsequent grain fragmentation. 2014 Acta

   critical tube diameter and the critical energy for direct initiation of
   spherical detonations increase with the increase of argon dilution. The
   scaling behavior between the critical tube diameter d(c) and the
   detonation cell size lambda as well as the critical direct initiation
   energy E-c is systematically studied with the effect of argon dilution.
   The present results again validate that the relation d(c) = 13 lambda
   holds for 0-30\% argon diluted mixtures and breaks down when argon
   dilution increases up to 40\%. It is found that the explosion length
   scaling of R-o similar to 26 lambda becomes also invalid when the
   mixture contains approximately this same amount of argon dilution or
   more. This critical argon dilution is indeed close to that found from
   experiments in porous-walled tubes by Radulescu and Lee (2002) which
   exhibit a distinct transition in the failure mechanism. Cell size
   analysis in literature also indicates that the cellular detonation front
   starts to become more regular (or stable) when the argon dilution
   reaches more than 40-50\%. Regardless of the degree of argon dilution or
   mixture sensitivity, the phenomenological model developed from the
   surface energy concept by Lee, which provides a relation that links the
   critical tube diameter and the critical energy remains valid. The
   present experimental results also follow qualitatively the observation
   from chemical kinetic and detonation instability analyses. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{In this article, an improved approach is presented for designing
   Electromagnetic Bandgap (EBG) reflectors for slot antennas by using a
   waveguide aperture source in simulating reflection phase test. In this
   manner the nonplanar nature of the near field at the location of the
   source, that is, antenna, as well as its loading effect on the reflector
   are incorporated in the design of a mushroom-type EBG structure
   operating at 5.3 GHz. This EBG design performs as an efficient reflector
   in normal wave incidence while suppressing the substrate-bound modes
   propagating in the azimuthal directions. The designed EBG reflector is
   employed in several two-slot-antenna structures to establish excellent
   antenna isolation of at least 25 dB and single antenna gain of 5 dB at
   5.3 GHz in each scenario. To further reduce coupling, the antennas are
   reoriented to benefit from polarization mismatch and radiation pattern
   nulls, resulting in isolation values of above 40 dB for antennas spaced
   one wavelength apart. The two-antenna structures are also characterized
   for MIMO performance in a reverberation chamber and demonstrate an
   impressive diversity gain of better than 8 dB in a rich multipath
   environment. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J RF and Microwave CAE

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of concurrent
   administration of clinically relevant doses of zoledronic acid (ZA) and
   dexamethasone (DX) on bone healing after tooth extraction (EXO).
   Materials and Methods: Forty-four Sprague-Dawley rats (6-8 month old)
   were randomized into five groups: ZA + DX = weekly injection of ZA with
   DX for 7 weeks; WD = ZA with DX for 3 weeks then DX alone for 4 weeks; C
   = control saline for 7 weeks; ZA = ZA alone for 7 weeks and DX = DX
   alone for 7 weeks. ZA was administered at 0.13 mg/kg/week and DX at 3.8
   mg/kg/week and body weights recorded at the time of injection. All rats
   underwent extraction (EXO) of the mandibular and maxillary first molars
   at 3 weeks and were euthanized at 7 weeks. The extracted and
   non-extracted sides of both jaws were harvested for micro-CT analyses.
   Results: All rats, particularly those injected with ZA, exhibited weight
   gain till EXO followed by decline then recovery. ZA + DX group
   demonstrated highest fractional bone to tissue volume (BV/TV) in the
   non-extracted side. ZA + DX rats exhibited also highest volume and
   surface of sequestra. Only sequestra volume was statistically higher in
   the WD group compared to C group.
   Conclusion: Combined treatment with ZA and DX over a prolonged period
   inhibits bone remodeling and increased sequestra formation to a greater
   extent than either drug alone. Trauma caused by these sequestra cutting
   through the mucosa could play a key role in the development of BRONJ by
   potentially facilitating infection. ZA withdrawal may promote
   bone-remodeling reactivation following EXO. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The control of nanoparticle synthesis using thermal plasmas is difficult
   and often leads to problems of chemical and structural purity, and poor
   process robustness in terms of consistency of product from run to run.
   Good reactor design allowed to overcome these issues and to develop a
   new material based on graphene with a flake-like structure (labeled
   graphene nanoflakes, GNF) supporting nitrogen for catalytic
   applications, for example as platinum replacement in fuel cells. These
   structures showed not only to be active, but also stable in polymer
   electrolyte fuel cell operation. Characterization of these structures,
   in situ fuel cell studies and modeling analysis all indicate that
   achievement of stability relates on the crystalline two-dimensional
   graphene structure. This paper first reviews the basic aspects behind
   the structural objectives, describes the synthesis process design
   leading to this crystalline structure, and provides a two-dimensional
   analysis on the graphitic growth based on fundamental theory and CFD
   calculations. These calculations indicate that an independent control of
   the graphene structure thickness (number of atomic planes) and sheet
   lengths is possible in a thermal plasma reactor.}},

Abstract = {{A most commonly identified exogenous factor that significantly affects
   traffic crash injury severity sustained is the collision type variable.
   Most studies consider collision type only as an explanatory variable in
   modeling injury. However, it is possible that each collision type has a
   fundamentally distinct effect on injury severity sustained in the crash.
   In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that collision type
   fundamentally alters the injury severity pattern under consideration.
   Toward this end, we propose a joint modeling framework to study
   collision type and injury severity sustained as two dimensions of the
   severity process. We employ a copula based joint framework that ties the
   collision type (represented as a multinomial logit model) and injury
   severity (represented as an ordered logit model) through a closed form
   flexible dependency structure to study the injury severity process. The
   proposed approach also accommodates the potential heterogeneity (across
   drivers) in the dependency structure. Further, the study incorporates
   collision type as a vehicle-level, as opposed to a crash-level variable
   as hitherto assumed in earlier research, while also examining the impact
   of a comprehensive set of exogenous factors on driver injury severity.
   The proposed modeling system is estimated using collision data from the
   province of Victoria, Australia for the years 2006 through 2010. (C)

Abstract = {{In the current study, it was found that the physiochemical properties of
   TiO2 are effected with formic acid as a chelating agent in a sol-gel
   process. From XRD studies it was revealed that due to the chelation of
   formate group with titanium precursor, anatase/brookite mixture of 86:14
   is obtained while the control sample which has been prepared without
   formic acid showed pure anatase at 400 A degrees C. FTIR studies
   indicated that, the formate group favored a monodentate mode of
   coordination with titanium precursor under the effect of addition of
   increasing amount of formic acid, while under the effect of increasing
   titanium precursor content the formate group is chelated with titanium
   atoms in a bidentate bridging mode. In addition, from the FTIR study it
   was demonstrated that increasing the amount of water in the hydrolysis
   step, a reduction in the intensity of the carboxylate (COO-) stretches
   was observed indicating that the titania formate bridging complex
   becomes weaker, resulting in a weakened titanium gel network structure
   which could readily collapse during calcination favoring early rutile
   formation. Raman spectroscopy showed that as a result of sample
   composite nature and presence of oxygen vacancies as demonstrated by PL
   analysis causes the broadening and frequency shifting of the Raman
   bands. Photocatalytic studies demonstrated that the formic acid modified
   sample composed of anatase/rutile mixture of 94:6 calcined at 600 A
   degrees C show significantly higher catalytic activity compared to the
   control sample prepared under similar conditions. Kinetic analysis show
   first order kinetics for the decomposition of methylene blue, a rate
   constant (k(app)) of 0.074 min(-1) was obtained with anatase/rutile
   (94:6) mixture which is even higher than the Degussa P25 (0.067

Abstract = {{A boundary layer model is developed to analyze diffusion through a
   laminar falling film for incomplete penetration of the dissolved gas.
   Regarding the rather intractable nature of the problem, Kantorovich
   Integral Method is chosen. Accordingly, a mass transfer boundary layer
   is assumed to keep growing perpendicularly to the falling film until it
   hits the wall. Such an approach is superior to its preceding artworks
   based on Higbie's penetration theory in terms of implementation of more
   realistic conditions/modeling assumptions. Furthermore, unlike
   penetration model, this approach gives a criterion whether the diffusion
   is complete. Comparing the two models, boundary layer model estimates up
   to 2.3 \% larger mass transfer coefficients. Moreover, a sensitivity
   analysis of liquid velocity distribution upon Sherwood number is
   conducted. It is found that the local velocity at gas-liquid interface
   is of highest dominance. Experimental data of SO2 absorption in water
   reported in literature is exploited to validate the model. It is shown
   that boundary layer model better fits the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Reciprocating sliding wear experiments were conducted on cold-sprayed
   pure aluminum and Al-22.6 wt\% Al2O3 coatings using a custom-built in
   situ tribometer. Using a transparent sapphire counterface for the wear
   tests, the dynamic behavior of third body material in the contact was
   optically observed. The presence of Al2O3 particles led to greater
   stability of the transfer films adhering to the sapphire counterface, as
   well as greater stability of the friction coefficient and lower wear
   rates. Ex situ microanalysis of material in the wear tracks and transfer
   films suggests that the presence of Al2O3 particles promoted strain
   localization during sliding. This produced more uniform third body
   microstructures and protected the underlying aluminum matrix from
   deformation, which slowed the rate of transfer to the counterface.}},

Abstract = {{Two pilot-scale activated sludge reactors were operated for 98 days to
   provide the necessary data to develop and validate a new mathematical
   model predicting the reduction of biosolids production by ozonation of
   the return activated sludge (RAS). Three ozone doses were tested during
   the study. In addition to the pilot-scale study, laboratory-scale
   experiments were conducted with mixed liquor suspended solids and with
   pure cultures to parameterize the biomass inactivation process during
   exposure to ozone. The experiments revealed that biomass inactivation
   occurred even at the lowest doses, but that it was not associated with
   extensive COD solubilization. For validation, the model was used to
   simulate the temporal dynamics of the pilot-scale operational data.
   Increasing the description accuracy of the inactivation process improved
   the precision of the model in predicting the operational data. (C) 2014

   using alpha-Fe as a model system}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{61-69}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Atomistic simulations of the effects of H on edge dislocation mobility
   and pile-ups are performed to investigate possible nanoscale mechanisms
   for hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP). alpha-Fe is used as a
   model system because H diffusion is fast enough to capture kinetics
   within the time scales of molecular dynamics and because edge
   dislocation glide in alpha-Fe is similar to glide in face-centered cubic
   metals. Results over a wide range of H concentrations sufficient to
   generate a range of sizes in the Cottrell atmospheres show that the
   Cottrell atmospheres follow the moving dislocations, leading to a
   resistance to dislocation motion that is consistent with solute drag
   theory; thus, H reduces the dislocation mobility. Furthermore, once
   motion stops and a pile-up is established, the H Cottrell atmospheres do
   not affect the equilibrium spacing of dislocations in the pile-up; thus,
   the H atmosphere provides no ``shielding{''} of dislocation dislocation
   interactions. This result is consistent with conclusions from previous
   continuum calculations. Two oft-proposed mechanisms for HELP (H-induced
   increase in true dislocation mobility and decrease in
   dislocation-dislocation pile-up interactions) are therefore not
   supported by the present simulations. A mechanistic understanding of
   HELP phenomena observed in various experiments thus requires evaluation
   of more complex H-dislocation interactions. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{A semi-analytical method is developed to consider free vibrations of a
   functionally graded elastic plate resting on Winkler elastic foundation

   fluid is considered to be incompressible and inviscid. In the analysis,
   the effect of an in-plane force in the plate due to the weight of the
   fluid is taken into account. By satisfying the compatibility conditions
   along the interface of fluid and plate, the fluid-structure interaction
   is taken into account and natural frequencies and mode shapes of the
   coupled system are acquired by employing energy methods. The results
   obtained from the present approach are verified by those from a finite

   functionally graded materials, Winkler foundation stiffness and in-plane

Abstract = {{A procedure to estimate the seismic motion at the base of a building
   from measured acceleration response at two or more floors is presented.
   The proposed method is comprised of two steps. In the first step, the
   dynamic characteristics of the building are inferred by using an
   output-only system identification procedure. In the second step, the
   motion of the base of the building is estimated by using the transfer
   function of a simplified building model consisting of a shear and
   flexural continuous beam together with dynamic properties obtained in
   the first step. The proposed method is validated first with an
   analytical model subjected to the 1940 El Centro ground motion and then
   with an instrumented building in California that experienced the 1994
   Northridge earthquake, and the ground motions at the base of the
   building are available. It is shown that the proposed method is capable
   of providing very good estimates of the motion at the base. The use of
   the proposed method is finally illustrated on an instrumented building,
   where the sensor at the base of the building did not function during the
   1994 Northridge earthquake. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Current greenhouse supplemental lighting technology uses broad-spectrum
   high-pressure sodium lamps (UPS) that, despite being an excellent
   luminous source, are not the most efficient light source for plant
   production. Specific light frequencies in the 400- to 700-nm range have
   been shown to affect photosynthesis more directly than other wavelengths
   (especially in the red and blue ranges). Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
   could diminish lighting costs as a result of their high efficiency,
   lower operating temperatures, and wavelength specificity. LEDs can be
   selected to target the wavelengths used by plants, enabling growers to
   customize the light produced, to enable maximum plant production and
   limit wavelengths that do not significantly impact plant growth. In our
   experiment, hydroponically grown tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.)
   were grown using a full factorial design-with three light intensities
   (high: 135 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), medium: 115 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), and low:
   100 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) at three red (661 am) to blue (449 am) ratio
   levels (5:1, 10:1, and 19:1). Secondary treatments for comparison were
   100\% UPS, 100\% red LED light supplied from above the plant, 100\% red
   LED light supplied below the plant, a 50\%:50\% LED:HPS mixture, and a
   control (no supplemental fighting). Both runs of the experiment lasted
   120 days during the Summer Fall 2011 and the Winter-Spring 2011-12. The
   highest biomass production (excluding fruit) occurred with the 19:1
   ratio (red to blue) with increasing intensity resulting in more growth,
   whereas a higher fruit production was obtained using the 5:1 ratio. The
   highest marketable fruit production (fruit over 90 g) was obtained with
   the 50\%:50\% LED:HPS followed by 5:1 high and 19:1 high. Consistently
   the 5:1 high performed well in every category. LEDs have been shown to
   be superior in fruit production over UPS alone, and LEDs can improve
   tomato fruit production when mixed with UPS. LEDs provide a promising
   mechanism to enhance greenhouse artificial lighting systems.}},

Title = {{Improving Blood Pressure Control Through Pharmacist Interventions: A
   Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background-Control of blood pressure (BP) remains a major challenge in
   primary care. Innovative interventions to improve BP control are
   therefore needed. By updating and combining data from 2 previous
   systematic reviews, we assess the effect of pharmacist interventions on
   BP and identify potential determinants of heterogeneity.
   Methods and Results-Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the
   effect of pharmacist interventions on BP among outpatients with or
   without diabetes were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and
   CENTRAL databases. Weighted mean differences in BP were estimated using
   random effect models. Prediction intervals (PI) were computed to better
   express uncertainties in the effect estimates. Thirty-nine RCTs were
   included with 14 224 patients. Pharmacist interventions mainly included
   patient education, feedback to physician, and medication management.
   Compared with usual care, pharmacist interventions showed greater
   reduction in systolic BP (-7.6 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -9.0 to -6.3; I-2=67\%)
   and diastolic BP (-3.9 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -5.1 to -2.8; I-2=83\%). The 95\%
   PI ranged from -13.9 to -1.4 mm Hg for systolic BP and from -9.9 to +2.0
   mm Hg for diastolic BP. The effect tended to be larger if the
   intervention was led by the pharmacist and was done at least monthly.
   Conclusions-Pharmacist interventions - alone or in collaboration with
   other healthcare professionals - improved BP management. Nevertheless,
   pharmacist interventions had differential effects on BP, from very large
   to modest or no effect; and determinants of heterogeneity could not be
   identified. Determining the most efficient, cost-effective, and least
   time-consuming intervention should be addressed with further research.}},

Abstract = {{The high loading efficiency and controlled release of hydrophobic drugs
   is still an unmet goal in the development of drug delivery systems. In
   the present study, liposomes were developed to encapsulate 17
   beta-estradiol (E2), which is a sex steroid shown to confer protective
   effects in the cardiovascular system. Egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC),
   2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), or
   1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) were used to prepare
   liposomes by thin film hydration and tested for their ability to load E2
   with a high efficiency. DOPC-based liposomes were found to improve E2
   encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity compared to those composed
   of EPC and DPPC. In addition, neutral liposomes, liposomes prepared with
   the cationic charging agent DDAB, and liposomes prepared with the
   anionic charging agent DMPG, were characterized with regard to their E2
   encapsulation efficiency, loading capacity, particle size, zeta
   potential, and in vitro drug release. A human coronary artery
   endothelial (HCAE) cell model was used to further evaluate liposome
   effects on cytotoxicity and relative cellular uptake efficiency of each
   formulation. Results showed that DOPC liposomes composed of DDAB had the
   highest E2 loading capacity and improved cellular uptake compared to
   uncharged and DMPG-based liposomes, demonstrating the greatest potential
   to be used in future cardiovascular therapeutic applications. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A new technique for nucleating and observing silicon crystallites in
   confined geometries over amorphous substrates has been demonstrated
   using the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. Unlike the originally
   proposed VLS nanowire growth mechanism on a silicon substrate, confined
   growth within amorphous structures does not have an available source of
   silicon to saturate the catalyst prior to deposition or to control
   crystal orientation during growth. Silicon crystallites were nucleated
   in confined geometries of amorphous materials at 450 degrees C, with a
   silane partial pressure of 46 mTorr and a growth time of GO min.
   Crystallites with planar areas upwards of 17 mu m(2) were grown. It was
   found that there were two distinct solid lamellar morphologies present
   in the various test structures and that these morphologies affected the
   calculated growth rates, volumetric distributions and morphologies of
   the nucleated crystallites. The distribution of crystallite volumes for
   the two populations was measured and average growth rates were found
   between 3.17 x 10 (2) mu m(3)/(minute x mu m(2)) and 2.30 x 10 (2) mu
   m(3)/(minute x mu m(2)), where the area in the denominator represents
   the initial gold-vapor interface area It is believed that the different
   goldsilicon lamellar morphologies can be attributed to residue of the
   chromium adhesion layer which increased the lamellar spacing due to
   decreased unclercooling of the liquid gold-silicon solution.
   Unclercooling was estimated to be 130 degrees C from the eutectic
   temperature in the samples believed to have had their chromium adhesion
   layers completely removed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{Polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy
   (PM-IRRAS) and ellipsometry were used ex situ to investigate adsorption
   of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on a gold surface, in terms of the
   adsorption equilibrium and kinetics. The aim of the work was to examine
   if the two different techniques give similar/complementary results under
   the same experimental conditions employing the same protein/surface
   system, and thus validate the use of the techniques for the
   investigation of protein/surface interactions under the applied
   experimental conditions, in general. It was found that the adsorption of
   BSA on gold follows Type I isotherm, which can be described by the
   Freundlich isotherm. The initial BSA adsorption kinetics was found to be
   very fast, and the results were modelled using a two-step kinetic model.
   The first step represents reversible BSA adsorption that yields BSA
   adsorbed in a native configuration (01) that is not thermodynamically
   stable. The second step represents the irreversible transformation of
   this protein configuration into a thermodynamically stable
   surface-adsorbed configuration (02). It was found that the
   theta(2)/theta(1) ratio increased with time. Finally, the comparison of
   the results obtained by the two techniques showed a very good agreement.

Title = {{Effect of solids on pulp and froth properties in flotation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1461-1469}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Froth flotation is a widely used process of particle separation
   exploiting differences in surface properties. It is important to point
   out that overall flotation performance (grade and recovery) is a
   consequence of the quality and quantity of the solid particles collected
   from the pulp phase, transported into the froth phase, and surviving as
   bubble-particle aggregates into the overflow. This work will focus on
   studying these phenomena and will incorporate the effects of particle
   hydrophobicities in the 3-phase system. Solids are classed as either
   hydrophilic non-sulphide gangue (e.g. silica, talc), hydrophilic
   sulphide (e.g. pyrite), or hydrophobic sulphide (e.g. sphalerite). Talc
   is a surface-active species of gangue that has been shown to behave
   differently from silica (frother adsorbs on the surface of talc
   particles). Both are common components of ores and will be studied in
   detail. The focus of this work is to investigate the role of solids on
   pulp hydrodynamics, froth bubble coalescence intensity, water overflow
   rate with solids present, and in particular, the interactions between
   solids, frother and gas on the gas dispersion parameters. The results
   show that in the pulp zone there is no effect of solids on bubble size
   and gas holdup; in the froth zone, although hydrophilic particles solely
   do not effect on the water overflow rate, hydrophobic particles produce
   higher intensity of rates on water overflow and bubble coalescence, and
   many be attributed to the water reattachment.}},

Title = {{Tuning the surface Fermi level on p-type gallium nitride nanowires for
   efficient overall water splitting}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Solar water splitting is one of the key steps in artificial
   photosynthesis for future carbonneutral, storable and sustainable source
   of energy. Here we show that one of the major obstacles for achieving
   efficient and stable overall water splitting over the emerging
   nanostructured photocatalyst is directly related to the uncontrolled
   surface charge properties. By tuning the Fermi level on the nonpolar
   surfaces of gallium nitride nanowire arrays, we demonstrate that the
   quantum efficiency can be enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude.
   The internal quantum efficiency and activity on p-type gallium nitride
   nanowires can reach similar to 51\% and similar to 4.0 mol hydrogen
   h(-1) g(-1), respectively. The nanowires remain virtually unchanged
   after over 50,000 mu mol gas (hydrogen and oxygen) is produced, which is
   more than 10,000 times the amount of photocatalyst itself (similar to
   4.6 mmol). The essential role of Fermi-level tuning in balancing redox
   reactions and in enhancing the efficiency and stability is also
   elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{Layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition is a versatile technique which is
   beginning to be be explored for inductive tissue engineering
   applications. Here, it is demonstrated that a polyelectrolyte multilayer
   film system composed of glycol-chitosan (Glyc-CHI) and hyaluronic acid
   (HA) can be used to coat 3D micro-fabricated polymeric tissue
   engineering scaffolds. In order to overcome many of the limitations
   associated with conventional techniques for assessing cell growth and
   viability within 3D scaffolds, two novel, real-time, label-free
   techniques are introduced: impedance monitoring and optical coherence
   phase microscopy. Using these methods, it is shown that LbL-coated
   scaffolds support in vitro cell growth and viability for a period of at
   least two weeks at levels higher than uncoated controls. These
   polyelectrolyte multilayer coatings are then further adapted for
   non-viral gene delivery applications via incorporation of DNA carrier
   lipoplexes. Scaffold-based delivery of the enhanced green fluorescent
   protein (EGFP) marker gene from these coatings is successfully
   demonstrated in vitro, achieving a two-fold increase in transfection
   efficiency compared with control scaffolds. These results show the great
   potential of Glyc-CHI/HA polyelectrolyte multilayer films for a variety
   of gene delivery and inductive tissue engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{Despite cranberry being associated with the prevention of bacterial
   infections for over a century, our understanding of the bioavailability
   and mechanisms by which cranberry prevents infection is limited. This
   study investigates the interactions between cranberry proanthocyanidins
   (CPAC) and human serum proteins (albumin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and
   fibrinogen) that may be encountered during CPAC metabolism following
   ingestion. To better understand how CPAC might interfere with bacterial
   infection, we also examined the interactions between CPAC and selected
   bacterial virulence factors; namely, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
   rhamnolipid. The binding of CPAC to the serum proteins, rhamnolipids and
   LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4 can be described by Langmuir-type
   isotherms, allowing the determination of the apparent adsorption
   affinity constants, with CPAC interacting most strongly with fibrinogen
   with a binding constant of 2.2 X 10(8) These binding interactions will
   limit the bioavailability of the CPAC at the site of action, an
   important consideration in designing further clinical trials.
   Furthermore, CPAC interacts with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10 LPS, E. coli
   0111:B4 LPS, and P. aeruginosa rhamnolipids in fundamentally different
   manners, supporting the theory that cranberry prevents bacterial
   infections via multiple mechanisms.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{155-163}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Barton's shear strength model has been incorporated into the FLAC3D code
   as a ubiquitous joint model using the plastic flow rule, to analyze the
   potential effect of fault-slip bursts on mine openings. Comparison of
   the incorporated model with the classical Mohr-Coulomb model is
   conducted through a case study of a primary fault that is parallel to a
   steeply dipping tabular ore deposit, which is mined out by the sublevel
   stoping method. Based on the results obtained from the numerical
   analyses, seismic source parameters are calculated and compared for each
   case. The results show that faults having rough surfaces tend to cause
   much larger seismic events than faults with smooth surfaces. In
   addition, parametrical study with respect to fault-surface roughness
   shows that seismic moment and radiated energy significantly vary with
   the fault-surface roughness and the seismic moment does not necessarily
   correlate with the radiated energy. Peak particle velocity excited by
   seismic waves arising from the simulated fault-slips is also examined.
   It is found out from the results that peak particle velocity is strongly
   dependent upon the fault surface roughness and has a correlation with
   the radiated energy, but not with seismic moment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The solubilities of sodium metasilicate nonahydrate (Na2SiO3 center dot
   9H(2)O) in the NaCl-H2O, KCl-H2O, and NaCl-KCl-H2O systems were
   determined at the temperature range from (288.15 to 308.15) K using a
   dynamic method. The results show that the solubility of Na2SiO3 center
   dot 9H(2)O decreases first and then levels off with increasing
   concentration of NaCl from (0.17 to 4.50) mol.kg(-1), whereas the
   solubility in the Na2SiO3 center dot 9H(2)O(s)-saturated KCl solution
   increases slightly with the addition of KCl in the concentration range
   from (0.20 to 3.10) mol.kg(-1). The Na2SiO3 center dot 9H(2)O
   solubilities in all cases investigated were found to increase with the
   temperature increment. A new chemical model for the solubility has been
   established by the regression of the experimental solubilities data in
   the NaCl-H2O system to obtain the parameters of the Bromley-Zemaitis
   model. These newly obtained model parameters were applied to well
   predict the Na2SiO3 center dot 9H(2)O solubility in two other systems,

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a surface-micromachining technology to fabricate
   silicon carbide (SiC)-based capacitive micromachined ultrasonic
   transducers (CMUTs). The use of dc-sputtered amorphous SiC as a
   structural layer allows the fabrication process to limit the temperature
   to a thermal budget of 200 degrees C, which is the lowest reported to
   date, making this technology ideally suited for above-IC integration.
   The high Young's modulus of the deposited SiC film, along with its very
   low residual stress, results in high strength and resilient CMUT
   membranes. The placement of the suspended aluminum electrode directly at
   the bottom side of the membrane reduces the effective size of the
   electrostatic transduction gap, resulting in superior electro-mechanical
   coupling. Fabricated transducers are tested in air with both
   continuous-wave and pulsed signals, using a pitch-and-catch
   configuration. The transducer pair, composed of 110-mu m-diameter
   membrane arrays, exhibits a resonant frequency of 1.75 MHz, a 3
   dB-bandwidth of 0.15 MHz, and a transmission gain of -38 dB. The CMUT
   prototypes showcase the versatility of low-temperature dc-sputtered SiC
   films applied in the field of MEMS. {[}2013-0137]}},

Abstract = {{Multi-period optimization of conjunctive water management can utilize
   reservoirs and aquifer carry-over to alleviate drought impacts.
   Stakeholders' socio-economic and environmental indices can be used to
   minimize the socio-economic and environmental costs associated with
   water shortages in drought periods. The knowledge gap here is the
   evaluation and inclusion of the socio-economic and environmental value
   of conjunctive water management in terms of its drought mitigation
   capability. In this paper, an integrated water quantity-quality
   optimization model that considers socio-economic and environmental
   indices is developed. The model considers and integrates reservoir and
   aquifer carry-over, river-aquifer interaction and water quality with
   stakeholders' socio-economic indices of production, net income and labor
   force employment to evaluate the socio-economic and environmental value
   of conjunctive water management. Total dissolved solid (TDS) is used as
   the water quality index for environmental assessments. The model is
   formulated as a multi-period nonlinear optimization model, with analysis
   determining the optimal decisions for reservoir release and withdrawal
   from the river and aquifer in different months to maximize the
   socio-economic indices of stakeholders within the environmental
   constraints. The proposed model is used in Zayandehrood water resource
   system in Iran, which suffers from water supply and pollution problems.
   Model analysis results show that conjunctive water use in the
   Zayandehrood water basin reduces salinity by 50 \% in the wetland and
   keeps water supply reduction during a drought under 10 \% of irrigation
   demand.}},

Title = {{Impact of the cell life-cycle on bacteriophage T4 infection}},
Journal = {{FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{353}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-68}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Synchronized Escherichia coli cultures were infected with bacteriophage
   T4 at discrete points in the cell growth cycle. The cell cycle had a
   significant impact on the outcome of infection. Cell burst size was
   smallest for newly formed cells and increased dramatically as these
   progressed in the cell cycle. The largest burst sizes were achieved when
   infecting cells immediately prior to cell division. When cells were
   infected during cell division, the burst size was reduced back to its
   initial value. Interestingly, lysis time was longest for young cells,
   reached a minimum at the same point that burst size reached its maximum
   value, and then increased at the commencement of cell division.
   Consequently, phage productivity in cells about to undergo cell division
   was almost three times greater than the productivity of young, newly
   formed cells. The availability of intracellular resources is believed to
   be the major driving force behind phage productivity during infection.
   Indeed, intracellular RNA contents at the time of infection were found
   to correlate strongly with phage productivity. There was no significant
   relationship between cell DNA levels and phage productivity. Finally,
   burst size experiments suggested that the cell cycle also influenced the
   likelihood of a phage to undergo productive infection.}},

Title = {{Simulating intense shock pulses due to asperities during fault-slip}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{71-81}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Seismic waves arising from fault-slip that occurs in underground mines
   could inflict severe damage to mine openings. Experimental results have
   revealed that intense shock pulses could generate due to the unloading
   of fault surface asperities that move apart during the fault-slip. This
   study focuses on examining the effect of fault surface asperities on the
   seismic waves arising from fault-slip. By means of a mine-wide model,
   dynamic analyses are carried out in order to simulate collision and
   unloading of fault surface asperities. Saeb and Amadei's model and
   Barton's shear strength model are newly implemented into constitutive
   models of FIAC3D code for the analyses. Parametrical study is conducted
   with the dynamic analyses in order to examine the most influential
   factor on the generation of intense seismic waves. The results reveal
   that stress release due to the unloading of the asperities has a
   significant influence on the intensity of seismic waves, while the
   collision of asperities, stiffness of the fault, and asperity geometry
   have a much lesser influence. When the stress release is large, the peak
   particle velocity excited by seismic waves is found to increase
   threefold, compared to that for fault-slip occurring along a planar
   surface. It indicates that significant deterioration of rockmasses could
   be induced due to the high particle velocities. This study has
   numerically confirmed the hypothesis that intense shock pulses could
   occur due to the unloading of fault surface asperities. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this study, we explored the growth kinetics of the Al-Fe

   friction stir lap welds during post-weld annealing treatment at 350, 400

   emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) and transmission
   electron microscope (TEM) were employed to investigate the structure of
   the weld zone. The thickness and composition of the IM layers were
   evaluated using image analysis system and electron back-scatter
   diffraction (EBSD), respectively. Moreover, kernel average
   misorientation (KAM) analysis was performed to evaluate the level of
   stored energy in the as-welded state. The results showed that the growth
   kinetics of the IM layer was not governed by a parabolic diffusion law.
   Presence of the IM compounds as well as high stored energy near the
   joint interface of the as-welded sample was recognized to be the origin
   of the observed deviation from the parabolic diffusion law. (c) 2014

Title = {{Rheological Analysis of Sucrose Solution at High Temperatures Using a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{E540-E545}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Thermal process design, optimization, and deviation require the
   knowledge of engineering properties of food, such as rheological
   behavior, which is highly dependent on temperature. If a process is
   calculated based on the parameters obtained by extrapolation, it might
   lead to over- or underprocessing. The long time required for the product
   to reach the desired temperature, which is usual in many rheometers, may
   induce unexpected changes on the product. Model solutions are often used
   in engineering projects in order to simulate characteristics of real
   products. Thus, the objective of this study was to obtain rheological
   data of sucrose model solution at the actual high UHT (ultra-high
   temperature) process temperatures using a pressurized capillary
   rheometer, heated by a microwave system. The results provide the
   rheological behavior of the sucrose solutions and show that there is no
   deviation of the linearity of the Arrhenius plot above 100 degrees C for
   this product. This work was useful to illustrate the use of the applied
   methodology and to validate the newly built microwave-heated capillary
   rheometer. The data obtained confirm the stability of nonsaturated
   sucrose solution when treated above 100 degrees C and presents an
   important contribution to the literature database, since sucrose
   solutions are used as models for many table syrups, such as maple and
   sorghum syrups.
   Practical Application The paper deals with the practical use of a
   pressurized capillary rheometer, rapidly heated by a microwave system,
   which was built and patented. The data on high temperature rheology
   obtained with this equipment can be used to accurately design thermal
   treatments of fluid food, in order to optimize the time and temperature
   conditions, thus not having the risk to happen an under- or
   overprocessing of the fluid, due to unexpected alterations that might
   occur at high temperatures, which are not accounted for when calculating
   the rheological properties through extrapolation or by measuring samples
   which were overheated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the flexural behavior of a locally loaded Carbon
   Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composite rectangular plate with
   different edge support conditions. The transversely isotropic elasticity
   properties of the unidirectionally reinforced laminae were determined
   experimentally and verified through computational modeling. The assembly
   of the laminae is used to construct a model of the plate. The layered
   composite CFRP plate used in the experimental investigation consisted of
   11 layers of a polyester matrix reinforced with carbon fibres. The bulk
   fibre volume fraction in the plate was approximately 61\%. The
   experimental results for the deflected shape of the plate are compared
   with computational results that take into account large deflections of
   the plate within the small strain range. It was found that the
   Representative Area Element (RAE) method developed for estimating the
   elastic properties of unidirectional fibre reinforced plates provides
   reliable estimates for the finite element modeling of the composite
   plate at the macro-scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional nonlinear size-dependent motion characteristics of
   a microbeam are investigated numerically, with special consideration to
   one-to-one internal resonances between the in-plane and out-of-plane
   transverse modes. All of the in-plane and out-of-plane displacements and
   inertia are taken into account and Hamilton's principle, in conjunction
   with the modified couple stress theory, is employed to obtain the
   nonlinear partial differential equations governing the motions of the
   system in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The discretization
   procedure is carried out by applying the Galerkin technique to the
   partial differential equations of motion, yielding a set of nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations. A linear analysis is performed upon
   this set of equations so as to obtain the size-dependent natural
   frequencies of the system. The nonlinear analysis of the discretized
   equations of motion is carried out by employing the pseudo-arclength
   continuation technique, resulting in the resonant responses of the
   system. It is shown that, due to the presence of one-to-one internal
   resonances between the in-plane and out-of-plane transverse modes, an
   in-plane excitation can give rise to an out-of-plane displacement; the
   internal resonances also cause the occurrence of extra solution branches
   and new bifurcation points. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1926-1937}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of inferring the topology of a network M with
   sources and receivers (an M-by-N network), by sending probes between the
   sources and receivers. Prior work has shown that this problem can be
   decomposed into two parts: first, infer smaller subnetwork components
   (1-by-' s or 2-by-2' s) and then merge them to identify the M-by-N
   topology. We focus on the second part, which had previously received
   less attention in the literature. We assume that a 1-by-topology is
   given and that all 2-by-2 components can be queried and learned using
   end-to-end probes. The problem is which 2-by-2' s to query and how to
   merge them with the given 1-by-, so as to exactly identify the
   2-by-topology, and optimize a number of performance metrics, including
   the number of queries (which directly translates into measurement
   bandwidth), time complexity, and memory usage. We provide a lower bound,
   {[}N/2], on the number of 2-by-2' s required by any active learning
   algorithm and propose two greedy algorithms. The first algorithm follows
   the framework of multiple hypothesis testing, in particular Generalized
   Binary Search (GBS). The second algorithm is called the Receiver
   Elimination Algorithm (REA) and follows a bottom-up approach. It
   requires exactly N - 1 steps, which is much less than all (N2) possible
   2-by-2' s. Simulation results demonstrate that both algorithms correctly
   identify the 2-by-topology and are near-optimal, but REA is more
   efficient in practice.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the performance of the simulateur

   predicting grain yield and dry biomass of corn under three nitrogen (N)
   treatments-low, medium, and high N levels-applied on a conventional
   drainage field in eastern Canada over a 2-year period. The impacts of
   climate change on simulated grain corn and biomass yield in eastern
   Canada under tile-drained conditions was also evaluated over a 30-year
   future period (2040-2069). The 2008 data set was selected for
   calibration, whereas the 2009 data set was used for validation of the
   model. Corn grain yield was underestimated by 1.5-2.6 Mg ha-1 for the
   2years of measurement. Total dry biomass was also underestimated by
   0.9-2.6 Mg ha-1. Tukey's studentized range (HSD) test of corn grain
   yield indicated that yields at high and low N and high and medium N were
   different at the 95\% confidence level. Grain and biomass production
   from 2040-2069 under B1 emission scenarios responded differently
   (P<0.05) for the three N treatments. A Mann-Kendall, nonparametric test
   performed on simulated corn grain and biomass yields attributable to
   climate change under B1 emission scenarios showed neither an increasing
   nor a decreasing trend at a 95\% confidence level.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing incidence of mixed assemblages of toxic and nontoxic
   cyanobacterial blooms in Quebec's freshwater bodies over the last
   decade, coupled with inherent inadequacies of current monitoring
   approaches, warrants development of sensitive and reliable tools for
   assessing the toxigenic potential of these water blooms. In this study,
   we applied three independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays that
   simultaneously target the microcystin synthetase (mcy) genes A, E, and G
   to rapidly and reliably detect and quantify potentially toxic
   Microcystis genotypes in the Missisquoi bay, Quebec, Canada. Linear
   regressions of quantitative PCR threshold cycles (C-t) against the
   logarithm of their respective Microcystis cell number equivalents
   resulted in highly significant linear curves with coefficients of
   determination (R-2) greater than 0.99 (p < 0.0001, n = 6) and reaction
   efficiencies of 91.0, 95.8, and 92.7\%, respectively, for the mcyA,
   mcyE, and mcyG-based quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays. The three
   assays successfully estimated potential microcystin-producing
   Microcystis genotypes from all field samples. The proportions of
   MicrocystismcyA, mcyE, and mcyG genotypes to total Microcystis cell
   counts showed substantial spatial variability ranging between
   1.7-21.6\%, 1.9-11.2\%, and 2.2-22.6\%, respectively. Correlation of
   microscopically determined total Microcystis counts to qPCR-based
   MicrocystismcyA, mcyE, or mcyG cell number equivalents resulted in
   highly significant associations with R-2 > 0.90. Thus, PCR-based assays
   targeting the mcyA, mcyG, and/or mcyE genes can serve as powerful
   screening tools for rapid and sensitive estimation of
   microcystin-producing Microcystis genotypes in freshwater water bodies.

Abstract = {{Introduction: Recent evidence indicates that the human gut microbiome
   plays a significant role in health and disease. Dysbiosis, defined as a
   pathological imbalance in a microbial community, is becoming
   increasingly appreciated as a `central environmental factor' that is
   both associated with complex phenotypes and affected by host genetics,
   diet and antibiotic use. More recently, a link has been established
   between the dysmetabolism of bile acids (BAs) in the gut to dysbiosis.
   Areas covered: BAs, which are transformed by the gut microbiota, have
   been shown to regulate intestinal homeostasis and are recognized as
   signaling molecules in a wide range of metabolic processes. This review
   will examine the connection between BA metabolism as it relates to the
   gut microbiome and its implication in health and disease.
   Expert opinion: A disrupted gut microbiome, including a reduction of
   bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-active bacteria, can significantly impair the
   metabolism of BAs and may result in an inability to maintain glucose
   homeostasis as well as normal cholesterol breakdown and excretion. To
   better understand the link between dysbiosis, BA dysmetabolism and
   chronic degenerative disease, large-scale metagenomic sequencing
   studies, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics and metabolomics should
   continue to catalog functional diversity in the gastrointestinal tract
   of both healthy and diseased populations. Further, BSH-active probiotics
   should continue to be explored as treatment options to help restore
   metabolic levels.}},

Title = {{Behavior of Reinforced Concrete Beams Strengthened in Shear Using
   L-Shaped CFRP Plates: Experimental Investigation}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on
   reinforced concrete (RC) T-beams retrofitted in shear with prefabricated
   L-shaped carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates. Shear
   strengthening of RC beams with L-shaped fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)
   plates has proved effective. In this method, grooves are made throughout
   the beam flange to fully embed the vertical leg of the L-shaped CFRP
   plate perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the RC beam and in the
   RC beam web surface. However, in some cases, drilling grooves in the
   concrete flange might not be feasible because of the presence of
   obstacles such as longitudinal steel in the flange of the RC beams.
   Therefore, the main objective of this investigation was to evaluate the
   performance of the RC beams strengthened in shear with externally bonded
   (EB) L-shaped plates as affected by the embedment length of the L-shaped
   FRP plates. In total, six tests were performed on 2,500-mm long T-beams.
   Three specimens were strengthened in shear using epoxy-bonded L-shaped
   CFRP plates with different embedment lengths in the RC beam flange. One
   specimen was shear-strengthened with fully embedded CFRP plates in the
   concrete beam flange. The second specimen was strengthened with partial
   embedment of the L-shaped CFRP plate. This specimen is representative of
   the case where full penetration of the CFRP plate is not feasible
   because of an obstacle. In this specimen, the embedment length was set
   to 25mm to simulate the minimum concrete cover thickness in RC beams.
   The third specimen was shear-strengthened with L-shaped CFRP plates with
   no embedment in the concrete beam flange. In addition, the performance
   of the beams strengthened with L-shaped CFRP plates was compared with
   that of a similar specimen strengthened with EB FRP sheets without
   embedment. Results show that the performance of the specimens
   strengthened with partially and fully embedded L-shaped CFRP plates in
   the beam flange was superior to that of the beams strengthened with EB
   FRP sheets and L-shaped CFRP plates with no embedment.}},

Abstract = {{In order to further advance the state of the art in the electron beam
   processing of polymers and composites, it is necessary to better
   understand the development of cure-induced residual stresses. In situ
   measurement of electron beam cure-induced stress development is
   challenging due to the bombardment of specimens with intense beams of
   very high-voltage electrons. In this study, a custom fixture was
   designed to measure the deformation of an electron beam-cured specimen
   during processing and thereby to assess specimen stress state during the
   curing process. The unbalanced composite specimen consisted of two cured
   unidirectional carbon-epoxy laminates separated by a thin woven
   fibreglass carrier, which was infused by a layer of electron beam
   curable epoxy resin systems (Tactix 123 and CAT B). The out-of-plane
   specimen deformations were monitored during various electron beam
   irradiation schedules and subsequent thermal post-cure. The preliminary
   results confirmed that the apparatus was not affected by the irradiation
   and was capable of accurately measuring the specimen warpage during the
   cure. It was also shown that the electron beam-cured specimens exhibit a
   reduced residual stress state compared to equivalent thermally cured
   specimens. It was observed that the irradiation dose rate applied to a
   specimen is the main factor in the difference in the way residual
   stresses develop during electron beam curing. Furthermore, the results
   suggest that there is a direct relation between the stress-free
   temperature (T-SF) and the temperature of the specimen at gelation
   (T-GEL).}},

Abstract = {{A nondestructive and rapid method using near-infrared (NIR)
   hyperspectral imaging was investigated to determine the spatial
   distribution of fat and moisture in Atlantic salmon fillets. Altogether,
   100 samples were studied, cutting out from different parts of five whole
   fillets. For each sample, the hyperspectral image was collected with a
   pushbroom NIR (899-1,694 nm) hyperspectral imaging system followed by
   chemical analysis to measure its reference fat and moisture contents.
   Mean spectrum were extracted from the region of interest inside each
   hyperspectral image. The quantitative relationships between spectral
   data and the reference chemical values were successfully developed based
   on partial least squares (PLS) regression with correlation coefficient
   of prediction of 0.93 and 0.94, and root mean square error of prediction
   of 1.24 and 1.06 for fat and moisture, respectively. Then the PLS models
   were applied pixel-wise to the hyperspectral images of the prediction
   samples to produce chemical images for visualizing fat and moisture
   distribution. The results were promising and demonstrated the potential
   of this technique to predict constituent distribution in salmon fillets.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Electricity production in single-anode/cathode MFCs fed with simulated
   synthesis gas (syngas) as the sole electron donor has recently been
   demonstrated. This study evaluated the ability of a multi-anode/cathode
   MFC fed with syngas to achieve improved volumetric efficiency at several
   operating temperatures and electrode arrangements.
   RESULTS
   A maximum power density of 33 mW LR-1 (normalized to the anodic
   compartment volume) and a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 43\% was achieved
   at an operating temperature of 37 degrees C. MFC operation at 50 degrees
   C resulted in a much lower power density of 10 mW LR-1 and a CE of 15\%.
   The MFC power density was greatly impacted by the electrode arrangement
   and the highest power density was achieved in a three anode-two cathode
   (3A-2C) arrangement.
   CONCLUSION
   The multi-electrode design enhanced the performance of a syngas-fed MFC,
   which could have major economic and operational implications for
   designing large-scale syngas-fed MFCs. The MFC performance at elevated
   temperatures was restricted by low microbial activity, implying that a
   thermophilic rather than a mesophilic inoculum might be required for
   successful operation under thermophilic conditions. (c) 2013 Society of

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the optimal power allocation scheme and
   corresponding capacity limit of a full-duplex (FD) dual-hop
   amplify-and-forward relay system under residual self-interference whose
   variance is proportional to the lambda'th power of the transmitted power
   (0 <= lambda <= 1). At first, the related optimization problems are
   shown to be quasiconcave under both per-node and sum power constraints.
   Given the non-linearity of the derivative, bisection is then proposed to
   obtain the optimal power strategies. The capacity and optimal schemes
   are then analyzed in different high power regions. Specifically, we
   apply the dominant balance method to show that full power at the relay
   is suboptimal when its power constraint approaches a large value.
   Following a similar approach, we then show that the multiplexing gain of
   the FD scheme with the optimal allocation is 1/{[}1 + lambda].
   Comparisons between the half-duplex and FD systems are finally carried
   out, where analytical and simulation results reveal that the FD system
   is superior in high source power regions with either fixed or large
   power constraints at the relay.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the multiphysics of multilayered and functionally
   graded cylinders subjected to steady-state
   hygrothermomagnetoelectromechanical loading. The cylinder is assumed to
   be axisymmetric, infinitely long, and with either hollow or solid cross
   section that is, both polarized and magnetized radially. The
   multiphysics model is used to investigate the effect of moisture,
   temperature, magnetic, electric, and mechanical loadings. The influence
   of imperfectly bonded interfaces is also accounted for in the governing
   equations. Exact solutions of differential equations are obtained for
   each homogenous layer of the multilayered cylinder. The results are
   verified with those available in literature for a homogenous infinitely
   long cylinder and can also be applied to study the multiphysics of thin
   circular disks. Maps are presented for solid and hollow cylinders to
   visualize the effect of hygrothermomagnetoelectromechanical loading,
   heterogeneity of bonded layers, and imperfectly bonded interfaces. The
   plots offer insight into the behavior of heterogeneous
   magnetoelectroelastic media in a steady state hygrothermal field.}},

Abstract = {{Non-oriented electrical steel (NOES) is one of the most common material
   used in electrical motors. Core loss and permeability are the most
   important properties that the motor manufacturers look for Both these
   properties are structure sensitive and depend on several metallurgical
   factors: such as chemistry, grain size, crystallographic texture,
   cleanliness and stress states in non-oriented electrical steels. It has
   been observed in this course of the study that the grain size and Si
   content of NOES are the primary controlling factors to core loss,
   especially at higher frequencies. On the contrary, crystallographic
   texture plays an important role at lower frequencies. At higher
   frequency, core loss increases with increasing grain size and decreasing
   Si content of the steels. Small difference in grain size (similar to 50
   mu m) at lower frequency range has little influence on the magnetic
   properties but has significant adverse effect as frequency reaches high
   enough. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{183-194}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of spectrum sensing in the
   presence of non-Gaussian noise for cognitive radio networks. A novel Rao
   test based detector, which does not require any a priori knowledge about
   the primary user (PU) signal and channels, is proposed for the detection
   of a primary user in non-Gaussian noises that are molded by the
   generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD). The statistic of the proposed
   Rao detector is derived and its detection performance is analyzed in the
   low signal-to-noise ratio regime and compared to that of the traditional
   energy detection. Furthermore, the Rao-based detection is extended to a
   multi-user cooperative framework by using the ``k-out-of-M{''} decision
   fusion rule and considering erroneous reporting channels between the
   secondary users and the fusion center due to Rayleigh fading. The global
   cooperative detection and false alarm probabilities are derived based on
   the cooperative sensing scheme. Analytical and computer simulation
   results show that for a given probability of false alarm, the Rao
   detector can significantly enhance the spectrum sensing performance over
   the conventional energy detection and the polarity-coincidence-array
   (PCA) method in non-Gaussian noises. Furthermore, the proposed
   cooperative detection scheme has a significantly higher global
   probability of detection than the non-cooperative scheme. (C) 2013

Title = {{Contraceptive Options and Their Associated Estrogenic Environmental
   Loads: Relationships and Trade-Offs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{This work explores the relationships between a user's choice of a given
   contraceptive option and the load of steroidal estrogens that can be
   associated with that choice. Family planning data for the USA served as
   a basis for the analysis. The results showed that collectively the use
   of contraception in the USA conservatively averts the release of
   approximately 4.8 tonnes of estradiol equivalents to the environment.
   35\% of the estrogenic load released over the course of all experienced
   pregnancies events and 34\% the estrogenic load represented by all
   resultant legacies are a result of contraception failure and the non-use
   of contraception. A scenario analysis conducted to explore the impacts
   of discontinuing the use of ethinylestradiol-based oral contraceptives
   revealed that this would not only result in a 1.7-fold increase in the
   estrogenic loading of the users, but the users would also be expected to
   experience undesired family planning outcomes at a rate that is 3.3
   times higher. Additional scenario analyses in which
   ethinylestradiol-based oral contraceptive users were modeled as having
   switched entirely to the use of male condoms, diaphragms or copper IUDs
   suggested that whether a higher or lower estrogenic load can be
   associated with the switching population depends on the typical failure
   rates of the options adopted following discontinuation. And, finally, it
   was estimated that, in the USA, at most 13\% of the annual estrogenic
   load can be averted by fully meeting the contraceptive needs of the
   population. Therefore, while the issue of estrogen impacts on the
   environment cannot be addressed solely by meeting the population's
   contraceptive needs, a significant fraction of the estrogenic mass
   released to environment can be averted by improving the level with which
   their contraceptive needs are met.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteriophage-functionalized surfaces are a new class of advanced
   functional material and have been demonstrated to be applicable for use
   as antimicrobial surfaces in medical applications (e.g., indwelling
   medical devices or wound dressings) or as biosensors for bacterial
   capture and detection. However, the complex composition of many real
   life samples (e.g., blood, natural waters, etc.) can potentially
   interfere with the interaction of phage and its bacterial host, leading
   to a decline in the efficiency of the phage-functionalized surface. In
   this study, the bacterial capture efficiency of two model
   phage-functionalized surfaces was assessed in the presence of potential
   environmental and biomedical interferents. The two phage bacteria
   systems used in this study are PRD1 with Salmonella Typhimurium and T4
   with Escherichia coli. The potential interferents tested included humic
   and fulvic acids, natural groundwater, colloidal latex microspheres,
   host extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), albumin, fibrinogen, and
   human serum. EPS and human serum decreased the host capture efficiency
   for immobilized PRD1 and T4, and also impaired the infectivity of the
   nonimmobilized (planktonic) phage. Interestingly, humic and fulvic acids
   reduced the capture efficiency of T4-functionalized surfaces, even
   though they did not lead to inactivation of the suspended virions.
   Neither humic nor fulvic acids affected the capture efficiency of PRD1.
   These findings demonstrate the inadequacy of traditional phage selection
   methods (i.e., infectivity of suspended phage toward its host in clean
   buffer) for designing advanced functional materials and further
   highlight the importance of taking into account the environmental
   conditions in which the immobilized phage is expected to function.}},

Abstract = {{Voice is the essential part of singing and speech communication. Voice
   disorders significantly affect the quality of life. The viscoelastic
   mechanical properties of the vocal fold mucosa determine the
   characteristics of the vocal folds oscillations, and thereby voice
   quality. In the present study, a non-invasive method was developed to
   determine the shear modulus of human vocal fold tissue in vivo via
   measurements of the mucosal wave propagation speed during phonation.
   Images of four human subjects' vocal folds were captured using high
   speed digital imaging (HSDI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for
   different phonation pitches, specifically fundamental frequencies
   between 110 and 440 Hz. The MRI images were used to obtain the
   morphometric dimensions of each subject's vocal folds in order to
   determine the pixel size in the high-speed images. The mucosal wave
   propagation speed was determined for each subject and at each pitch
   value using an automated image processing algorithm. The transverse
   shear modulus of the vocal fold mucosa was then calculated from a
   surface (Rayleigh) wave propagation dispersion equation using the
   measured wave speeds. It was found that the mucosal wave propagation
   speed and therefore the shear modulus of the vocal fold tissue were
   generally greater at higher pitches. The results were in good agreement
   with those from other studies obtained via in vitro measurements,
   thereby supporting the validity of the proposed measurement method. This
   method offers the potential for in vivo clinical assessments of vocal
   folds viscoelasticity from HSDI. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Effects of high-pressure (HP) treatment on the rheological, thermal and
   dielectric properties of the four selected starch dispersions (two
   modified starches, one native and one resistant) were evaluated.
   Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and oscillatory rheometry were
   employed to assess the extent of starch gelatinization and the developed
   gel rigidity (G') of starch gels after HP treatment. It was observed
   that starch dispersions gelatinized completely at 500 MPa with a 30-min
   holding time. The HP-treated starch samples exhibited predominantly
   solid-like (G' > G `') behavior except for the resistant starch.
   Pressure-induced gel rigidity differed significantly among starch
   samples. The G' of starch gels increased with the pressure (400-600 MPa)
   in the studied frequency range (0.1-10 Hz) except for the native starch
   where a marginal decrease was recorded at similar condition. The holding
   time (15-30 min) and concentration (20-25\% w/w) significantly
   attributed towards gel rigidity of starch samples. Measurement of
   dielectric properties of HP-treated samples over the frequency range
   450-4450 MHz indicated differences in the dielectric constant
   (epsilon'), loss factor (epsilon `') and penetration depth among starch
   gels. Pressure did not show any effect on dielectric property of the
   resistant starch sample. Power penetration depth decreased significantly
   with frequency and with the pressure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Quantized Network Coding for correlated sources}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Month = {{MAR 13}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a data gathering technique for sensor networks
   that exploits correlation between sensor data at different locations in
   the network. Contrary to distributed source coding, our method does not
   rely on knowledge of the source correlation model in each node although
   this knowledge is required at the decoder node. Similar to network
   coding, our proposed method (which we call Quantized Network Coding)
   propagates mixtures of packets through the network. The main conceptual
   difference between our technique and other existing methods is that
   Quantized Network Coding operates on the field of real numbers and not
   on a finite field. By exploiting principles borrowed from compressed
   sensing, we show that the proposed technique can achieve a good
   approximation of the network data at the sink node with only a few
   packets received and that this approximation gets progressively better
   as the number of received packets increases. We explain in the paper the
   theoretical foundation for the algorithm based on an analysis of the
   restricted isometry property of the corresponding measurement matrices.
   Extensive simulations comparing the proposed Quantized Network Coding to
   classic network coding and packet forwarding scenarios demonstrate its
   delay/distortion advantage.}},

Abstract = {{The development of aluminum-lithium alloys for aerospace applications
   requires a thorough understanding of how processing and product geometry
   impact their microstructure, texture and mechanical properties. The
   anisotropy of the mechanical properties is in part related to the
   deformation texture formed during thermo-mechanical processing. In this
   study, two different extrusions of Al-Li 2099 T83 were characterized, a
   cylindrical extrusion and an integrally stiffened panel (ISP). A
   decrease of tensile properties was observed from the longitudinal
   direction to the transverse direction with a minimum in the 45
   direction, the magnitude of which depends on the location in the
   extrusions. The < 111 > fiber texture is prominent in most locations of
   the extrusion with a smaller intensity of the < 111 > component. Rolling
   textures were observed in two locations of the ISP that have a larger
   cross sectional aspect ratio. Variations of strength and anisotropy as a
   function of location in the extrusion correlate well with the intensity
   of the < 111 > fiber texture. On the other hand, our findings show an
   absence of correlation between the Taylor factor and the anisotropy.
   These results suggest that strength anisotropy may be controlled by the
   volume fraction of T-1 precipitates that could itself be related to the
   intensity of the < 111 > fiber texture. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Analytical and experimental performance evaluation of an integrated

Journal = {{OPTICS EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{5693-5730}},

Abstract = {{We study analytically and experimentally the performance limits of a
   Si-photonic (SiP) balanced coherent receiver (CRx) co-packaged with
   transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs) in a colorless WDM scheme. Firstly, the
   CRx architecture is depicted and characterization results are presented.
   Secondly, an analytical expression for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   at the CRx output is rigorously developed and various noise sources in
   the context of colorless reception are outlined. Thirdly, we study
   experimentally the system-level CRx performance in colorless reception
   of 16 x 112 Gbps PDM-QPSK WDM channels. Using a 15.5 dBm local
   oscillator (LO) power, error free transmissions over 4800 and 4160 km at
   received powers of -3 and -21 dBm per channel, respectively, were
   achieved in a fully colorless and preamplifierless reception. Next, a
   set of measurements on one of the center WDM channels is performed where
   the LO power, received signal power, distance, and number of channels
   presented to the CRx are swept to evaluate the performance limits of
   colorless reception. Results reveal that the LO beating with optical
   noise incoming with the signal is a dominant noise source regardless of
   received signal power. In the high received signal power regime (similar
   to 0 dBm/channel), the self-beat noise from out-of-band (OOB) channels
   is an additional major noise source especially for small LO-to-signal
   power ratio, short reach and large number of OOB channels. For example,
   at a received signal power of 0 dBm/channel after 1600 km transmission,
   the SNR difference between the fully filtered and colorless scenarios,
   where 1 and 16 channels are passed to the CRx respectively, grows from
   0.5 to 3.3 dB as the LO power changes from 12 to 0 dBm. For low received
   power (similar to-12 dBm/channel), the effect of OOB channels becomes
   minor while the receiver shot and thermal noises become more
   significant. We identify the common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and
   sensitivity as the two important CRx specifications that impact the
   performance at high and low received signal power regimes, respectively.
   Finally, an excellent match between experimental and analytical SNRs is
   proven after the derived SNR model is fitted to the experimental data in
   a least-squares sense. The model is then used to predict that the CRx
   can operate colorlessly for a fully populated WDM spectrum with 80
   channels provided that the LO-to-signal power ratio is properly set. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine the coupled thermo-poromechanical behaviour of
   a fluid-saturated porous medium of infinite extent bounded internally by
   a fluid-filled cavity. The mechanical behaviour of the porous skeleton
   can either be Hookean elastic or elasto-plastic, with a constitutive
   response corresponding to a modified Cam Clay plasticity model. The
   fluid within the cavity can be subjected simultaneously to a temperature
   rise and a pressure pulse. The paper presents analytical results for the
   spherically symmetric thermo-poroelasticity problem and these are used
   to validate the thermo-poroelasticity module of a computational code. We
   proceed to examine the thermo-poroelasto-plasticity problem. Results
   presented in the paper illustrate the interaction between thermal and
   mechanical phenomena and their influence on the cavity fluid pressure
   and the skeletal stresses at the cavity boundary. The paper presents

   irreversibility}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{The voter model is widely used to model opinion dynamics in society. In
   this paper, we propose three modifications to incorporate heterogeneity
   into the model. We address the corresponding oversimplifications of the
   conventional voter model which are unrealistic. We first consider the
   voter model with popularity bias. The influence of each node on its
   neighbors depends on its degree. We find the consensus probabilities and
   expected consensus times for each of the states. We also find the
   fixation probability, which is the probability that a single node whose
   state differs from every other node imposes its state on the entire
   system. In addition, we find the expected fixation time. Then two other
   extensions to the model are proposed and the motivations behind them are
   discussed. The first one is confidence, where in addition to the states
   of neighbors, nodes take their own state into account at each update. We
   repeat the calculations for the augmented model and investigate the
   effects of adding confidence to the model. The second proposed extension
   is irreversibility, where one of the states is given the property that
   once nodes adopt it, they cannot switch back. This is motivated by
   applications where, agents take an irreversible action such as seeing a
   movie, purchasing a music album online, or buying a new product. The
   dynamics of densities, fixation times and consensus times are obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Phase equilibria in the Mg-rich region of the Mg-Sn-In (at 415 degrees C

   sections with constant 5 In and 10 Sn at.\% of Mg-In-Sn system, and 10
   Sn at.\% of Mg-In-Zn system were determined by differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC). No ternary compounds were found in the Mg-Sn-Zn and
   Mg-Sn-In isothermal sections. Critical evaluation and thermodynamic
   optimization of the Mg-Sn-In-Zn quaternary system were carried out using
   CALPHAD (Calculation of Phase Diagrams) technique. The Modified
   Quasichemical Model in the Pair Approximation (MQMPA) was used for
   modeling the liquid solution, which exhibits a high degree of
   short-range ordering behavior. The solid phases were modeled with the
   Compound Energy Formalism (CEF). All available and reliable experimental
   data were reproduced within experimental error limits. A self-consistent

Abstract = {{Microwave-assisted extraction is gaining in popularity for the
   production of plant extracts and the dielectric properties determine the
   behaviour of different materials in a microwave environment; hence the
   measurement of the dielectric properties of different solvents used for
   analytical purposes and the interpretation of their heating rate can
   help in minimising the time and solvent consumption. In this study, the
   dielectric constant and dielectric loss of different combinations
   (generated using central composite design (CCD)) of ethanol
   concentrations and acid (HCl and citric acid) at different temperature
   levels were measured at frequencies varying from 0.5 GHz to 6 GHz, and
   the dissipation factor and depth of penetration were calculated for the
   respective cases, which were analysed for the interpretation of heating
   rates of the different solvent combinations. Overall, for all the
   responses (observed and calculated), ethanol concentration levels and
   temperature levels were found to be the most significant factors; it was
   interpreted and observed that the heating rate increases with an
   increase in ethanol concentration and decreases with increasing
   temperature. In general, the dissipation factor was interpreted to
   increase with increase in acid concentration (observed from screening
   analysis); however, citric acid concentration was found to have an
   insignificant effect on the dissipation factor (as interpreted from CCD
   with response surface methodology (CCD-RSM)), and hence was found to
   have insignificant contribution to the heating rate at lower
   concentrations. In case of CCD-RSM analysis of the values of dissipation
   factor for the combinations of ethanol with HCl, the effect of acid
   concentration on the dissipation factor was found to be significant;
   however, it was still found to be negligible when the solvent
   combinations were heated in the microwave reactor.}},

   relation to biological materials and the strong correspondence between
   different synthetic and biological materials is discussed. Viscoelastic
   models for nematic and chiral nematics are reviewed and discussed in
   terms of key parameters that facilitate understanding and quantitative

Abstract = {{Understanding the environmental fate and transport of engineered
   nanoparticles (ENPs) is of paramount importance for the formation and
   validation of regulatory guidelines regarding these new and increasingly
   prevalent materials. The present study assessed the transport of an
   industrial formulation of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-stabilized silver
   nanoparticle (PVP-nAg) in columns packed with water-saturated quartz
   sand and the same sand coated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm
   of variable age (i.e., growth period). Physicochemical characterization
   studies indicate that the PVP-nAg is stable in suspension and exhibits
   little change in size or electrophoretic mobility with changing ionic
   strength (IS) in either NaNO3 or Ca(NO3)(2). The collector surface had a
   relatively homogeneous biofilm coating, as determined by CLSM, and a
   near uniform distribution of biomass and biofilm thickness following
   column equilibration. Transport experiments in clean sand revealed
   changes in the particle deposition behavior only at and above 10 mM IS
   Ca(NO3)(2) and showed no discernible change in PVP-nAg transport
   behavior in the presence of 1 to 100 mM NaNO3. Transport experiments in
   P. aeruginosa-coated sand indicated significantly reduced retention of
   PVP-nAg at low IS compared to clean sand, irrespective of biofilm age.
   Nanoparticle retention was also generally reduced in the biofilm-coated
   sand at the higher IS, but to a lesser extent. The decreased retention
   of PVP-nAg in biofilm-coated sand compared to clean sand is likely due
   to repulsive electrosteric forces between the PVP coatings and
   extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the biofilm. Additionally,
   the slope of the rising portion of the PVP-nAg breakthrough curve was
   noticeably steeper in biofilm conditions than in clean sand. More mature
   biofilm coating also resulted in earlier breakthrough of PVP-nAg
   compared to younger biofilm coatings, or to the clean sand, which may be
   an indication of the effect of repulsive surface forces combined with
   selective pore size exclusion from the pores of denser, more developed
   biofilm. These results, when considered with other literature, indicate
   the importance in considering the flow dynamics, pore network and
   structure, the effective particle size, and particle permeability with
   regard to the biofilm matrix when considering the possible influence of
   biofilms on ENP transport.}},

Abstract = {{A study was carried out to evaluate the effects of molecular weight and
   molecular structure on non-isothermal crystallization behavior of
   recycled and virgin polyamides (PA) and their corresponding glass fiber
   (GF) composites. Two different recycled polyamides (PA), namely
   post-industrial waste (PIW) and post-consumer waste (PCW) were used. The
   former was obtained from a fiber manufacturer and the latter was
   recycled from used carpets. The molecular weights of the resins were
   measured by intrinsic viscosity (IV) measurements and (13)carbon nuclear
   magnetic resonance (C-13-NMR). The NMR technique also provided
   information on PA structure, cis and trans amide conformers content and
   residual unreacted monomer. Non-isothermal crystallization of the resins
   was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular
   weights of recycled materials were higher than that of virgin injection
   molding grade PA-6. However, the crystallization rates (indicated by
   t(1/2)) of recycled resins were faster. It could be attributed to the
   presence of TiO2 in recycled materials. Moreover, the higher cis-amide
   conformer content of recycled resins suggested higher segmental
   mobility. On the other hand, the crystallization rate of composites
   based on recycled PA-6 was slower than that of composites based on the
   virgin PA-6. The suppression of crystallization rate was apparently due
   to PA-66 added during the preparation of reinforced recycled resins.
   This behavior was confirmed by model compounds based on PA-6/PA-66
   blends.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral vascular images obtained through angiography are used by
   neurosurgeons for diagnosis, surgical planning, and intraoperative
   guidance. The intricate branching of the vessels and furcations,
   however, make the task of understanding the spatial three-dimensional
   layout of these images challenging. In this paper, we present empirical
   studies on the effect of different perceptual cues (fog,
   pseudo-chromadepth, kinetic depth, and depicting edges) both
   individually and in combination on the depth perception of cerebral
   vascular volumes and compare these to the cue of stereopsis. Two
   experiments with novices and one experiment with experts were performed.
   The results with novices showed that the pseudo-chromadepth and fog cues
   were stronger cues than that of stereopsis. Furthermore, the addition of
   the stereopsis cue to the other cues did not improve relative depth
   perception in cerebral vascular volumes. In contrast to novices, the
   experts also performed well with the edge cue. In terms of both novice
   and expert subjects, pseudo-chromadepth and fog allow for the best
   relative depth perception. By using such cues to improve depth
   perception of cerebral vasculature, we may improve diagnosis, surgical
   planning, and intraoperative guidance.}},

Abstract = {{Recent earthquakes around the world have demonstrated that steel
   moment-frame buildings designed based on older seismic provisions are
   seismically deficient. To enhance the seismic performance of these
   buildings, a new seismic retrofit system has been developed and
   evaluated experimentally as part of a two-story steel moment-resisting
   frame, designed in California in the 1980s. The proposed retrofit system
   consists of high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (HPFRC) infill
   panels acting as energy dissipation elements that can be easily replaced
   after a major earthquake. Through two large-scale hybrid simulation
   tests of the retrofitted two-story steel moment-resisting frame, it is
   demonstrated that (1)the proposed retrofit system is effective in terms
   of reducing the maximum story drift ratios and residual deformations of
   the retrofitted steel moment resisting frame relative to the predicted
   bare frame performance, and (2)the structural damage of the retrofitted
   steel moment-resisting frame is kept minimal because energy dissipation
   is concentrated in the infill panel retrofit system.}},

Abstract = {{Two series of full-scale specimens were constructed and tested under

   a specimen with closed hoops and headed bars replacing the crossties,
   and a specimen that had all of the transverse reinforcement replaced by
   headed bars. It was concluded that headed bars provided a viable
   solution when used to replace crossties, offering similar confinement.
   In these monotonically loaded tests, it was also found that headed bars
   could be used to replace entirely the hoops and the crossties, offering

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is employed successfully in a
   suspension of multicomponent TiO2 nanoparticulates of different sizes
   and morphologies to engineer a very robust bifunctional electrode
   structure for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications that shows
   excellent light-harvesting and photoelectrochemical performance.
   Aqueous-synthesized anatase nanocrystallites and sub-micrometer-sized
   sea urchin-like rutile aggregates are formulated in a stable isopropanol
   suspension without resorting to binders or charging agents.
   Interestingly, extremely robust films are obtained because of the high
   surface reactivity, electrophoretic mobility, and unique morphology of
   the rutile aggregates. DSSCs built with the newly configured
   bifunctional electrode yielded a record efficiency (8.59\%) for
   EPD-fabricated devices without resorting to mechanical compression. Such
   green-engineered mesoporous electrode structures can be built on both
   metallic and plastic substrates and can find applications in various
   energy and environmental fields.}},

Title = {{Application of Dormant Reliability Analysis to Spillways}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Dams are essential infrastructures for water supply, flood control,
   energy production, and irrigation. A critical component for the safety
   of a dam is the spillway system which, by controlling releases, prevents
   overtopping of the dam. This in turn reduces impacts associated with
   excessive downstream flows and upstream water levels on infrastructures,
   the population, and the environment. This paper addresses reliability
   issues related to emergency spillways and specifically the estimation of
   their reliability level after prolonged periods of dormancy. During
   dormancy, spillway components are exposed to the environment and sustain
   cumulative damage that may trigger latent failures or failures on
   demand. Regular inspections and tests are used to detect and remediate
   latent failures and to assess the level of deterioration of components.
   The purpose of this study is to develop procedures to account for
   dormancy in the reliability analysis of spillways. It also demonstrates
   how these procedures can be used to evaluate the impact of the frequency
   of inspections and tests on the overall reliability of the spillways.
   This paper introduces measure of performance, dormant availability
   analysis, and dormant availability analysis via integrity assessment as
   methods to illustrate the unavailability or probability of failure on
   demand of a spillway system as a function of its dormancy period. This
   information can be used to determine the optimum frequency of inspection
   and tests taking into account the safety of the structure as well as the
   costs associated with inspection and testing.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{38-47}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The effect of boundary layer development on the dynamics of trains of
   flexibly interconnected rigid cylinders subjected to fluid dynamic
   forces is investigated theoretically. Each cylinder in the model is
   flexibly coupled to the other cylinders and is supported by springs,
   such that it has both translational and rotational degrees of freedom.
   The kinetic, dissipation, and potential energies of the system and the
   generalized forces associated with the fluid dynamic forces acting on
   the system, such as inviscid fluid dynamic forces, viscous frictional
   forces, and form drag, are obtained first. Then the equations of motion
   are derived in a Lagrangian framework. The effect of the boundary layer
   development is taken into account by integrating variable viscous
   frictional coefficients into the equations of motion, instead of taking
   them to be constant. This is part of a broader study into the dynamics
   of high-speed trains running in a tunnel, or more generally of a
   train-like system travelling in a coaxial cylindrical tube and subjected
   to aerodynamic forces associated with lateral motions of the cylinders.
   The results of this study show that the system becomes less stable if
   the boundary layer is considered to be developing from the head toward
   the tail of the train. In addition, the average values of equivalent
   sand roughness k(s){*} for high-speed Japanese trains are estimated from
   the previous data obtained from running experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio networks, in order to avoid interference form
   secondary users to the primary license holders of the spectrum, reliable
   spectrum sensing is necessary. In scenarios where the noise samples are
   correlated, the spectrum sensing methods optimized considering
   impairment by independent noise samples will not provide optimum
   performances. To address this issue, a locally optimum detection method
   for random signals under a weakly correlated noise model over fading
   channels is proposed. The probabilities of false alarm and detection of
   the proposed detector in the low signal to noise ratio regime are
   analyzed. The average probabilities are calculated over different
   channel gains. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate the
   superiority of the proposed method over the known energy detection
   method with comparable complexities. Furthermore, we consider the
   scenario where the estimated correlation is different from the real
   correlation and investigate the effect of this correlation mismatch on
   the probabilities of false alarm and detection of the proposed method.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The installation of wireless technologies in power substations requires
   characterizing the impulsive noise produced by the high-voltage
   equipment. Substation impulsive noise might interfere with classic
   wireless communications and none of the existing models can reliably
   represent this noise in wide band. Previous studies have shown that
   impulsive noise is characterized by series of damped oscillations with
   the amplitude, the duration and the occurrence times of the impulses
   that are random. All these characteristics make this noise
   time-correlated and the partitioned Markov chain remains an efficient
   model that can ensure the correlation between the samples. In this
   study, we propose to design a partitioned Markov chain to generate an
   impulsive noise that is similar to the noise measured in existing
   substations, in time and frequency domains. We configure our Markov
   chain to produce the impulses with the damped oscillation effect, then,
   we determine the probability transition matrix and the distribution of
   each state of the Markov chain. Finally, we generate noise samples and
   we study the distribution of the impulsive noise characteristics. Our
   Markov chain model can replicate the correlation between the measured
   noise samples; also the distributions of the noise characteristics are
   similar in the simulations and the measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The functional properties, such as color rendering index (CRI) and
   correlated color temperature (CCT) of nanowire white light emitting

   easy to tailor the spectrum. This is a significant advantage over
   phosphor converted or nanocrystal based white light sources since it is
   difficult to modulate the spectrum while maintaining high efficiency
   using these conventional methods. The authors demonstrated that the
   InGaN/(Al)GaN dot-in-a-wire heterostructure LEDs can generate high CRI
   values of 94-98 in both warm and cool white regions. Furthermore, the

   events of rainfall and temperature in the urban centers of Rajasthan
   State. The magnitude of the significant trend of monsoon rainfall varied
   from (-) 6.00 mm/hydrologic year at Nagaur to (-) 8.56 mm/hydrologic
   year at Tonic. However, the magnitude of the significant negative trends
   of non-monsoon rainfall varied from (-) 0.66 mm/hydrologic year at
   Dungarpur to (-) 1.27 mm/hydrologic year at Chittorgarh. The magnitude
   of positive trends of non-monsoon rainfall varied from 0.93
   mm/hydrologic year at Churu to 1.70 mm/hydrologic year at Hanumangarh.
   The magnitude of the significant negative trends of annual rainfall
   varied from (-) 6.47 mm/year at Nagaur to (-) 10.0 mm/year at Tonic. The
   minimum, average and maximum temperature showed significant increasing
   warming trends on an annual and seasonal scale in most of the urban
   centers in Rajasthan State. The magnitude of statistically significant
   annual extreme daily rainfall varied from 2.00 mm at Jhalawar to (-)
   1.64 mm at Tonk, while the magnitude of statistically significant
   extreme annual daily minimum and maximum temperature varied from 0.03
   degrees C at Ganganagar to 0.05 degrees C at Jhalawar, respectively. The
   spatial variations of the trends in mean (monsoon season, non-monsoon
   season and annual) and extreme annual daily rainfall and temperature
   were also determined using the inverse-distance-weighted (IDW)
   interpolation technique. IDW results are helpful to identify trends and
   variability in mean and extreme rainfall and temperature in space and
   time for the study locations where the data is not available and the
   quality of data is not good. These spatial maps of temperature and
   rainfall can help local stakeholders and water managers to understand
   the risks and vulnerabilities related to climate change in terms of mean
   and extreme events in the region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Effect of coarctation of the aorta and bicuspid aortic valve on flow
   dynamics and turbulence in the aorta using particle image velocimetry}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Blood flow in the aorta has been of particular interest from both fluid
   dynamics and physiology perspectives. Coarctation of the aorta (COA) is
   a congenital heart disease corresponding to a severe narrowing in the
   aortic arch. Up to 85 \% of patients with COA have a pathological aortic
   valve, leading to a narrowing at the valve level. The aim of the present
   work was to advance the state of understanding of flow through a COA to
   investigate how narrowing in the aorta (COA) affects the characteristics
   of the velocity field and, in particular, turbulence development. For
   this purpose, particle image velocimetry measurements were conducted at
   physiological flow and pressure conditions, with three different aorta
   configurations: (1) normal case: normal aorta + normal aortic valve; (2)
   isolated COA: COA (with 75 \% reduction in aortic cross-sectional area)
   + normal aortic valve and (3) complex COA: COA (with 75 \% reduction in
   aortic cross-sectional area) + pathological aortic valve. Viscous shear
   stress (VSS), representing the physical shear stress, Reynolds shear
   stress (RSS), representing the turbulent shear stress, and turbulent
   kinetic energy (TKE), representing the intensity of fluctuations in the
   fluid flow environment, were calculated for all cases. Results show
   that, compared with a healthy aorta, the instantaneous velocity
   streamlines and vortices were deeply changed in the presence of the COA.
   The normal aorta did not display any regions of elevated VSS, RSS and
   TKE at any moment of the cardiac cycle. The magnitudes of these
   parameters were elevated for both isolated COA and complex COA, with
   their maximum values mainly being located inside the eccentric jet
   downstream of the COA. However, the presence of a pathologic aortic
   valve, in complex COA, amplifies VSS (e. g., average absolute peak value
   in the entire aorta for a total flow of 5 L/min: complex COA: = 36
   N/m(2); isolated COA = 19 N/m(2)), RSS (e. g., average peak value in the
   entire aorta for a total flow of 5 L/min: complex COA: = 84.6 N/m(2);
   isolated COA = 44 N/m(2)) and TKE (e. g., average peak value in the
   entire aorta for a total flow of 5 L/min: complex COA: = 215 N/m(2);
   isolated COA = 100 N/m(2)). This demonstrates that the pathological
   aortic valve strongly interacts with the COA. Findings of this study
   indicate that the presence of both a COA and a pathological aortic valve
   significantly alters hemodynamics in the aorta and thus might contribute
   to the progression of the disease in this region. This study can
   partially explain the complications associated in patients with COA, in
   the presence of a pathological aortic valve and the consequent adverse
   outcome post-surgery.}},

Abstract = {{A new asynchronous delay-insensitive data-transmission method based on
   level-encoded dual-rail (LEDR) encoding with novel packet-structure
   restriction is proposed to realize a high-throughput network-on-chip
   (NoC) router together with a compact hardware. The use of LEDR encoding
   makes communication steps and the registers being used half in
   comparison with four-phase dual-rail encoding because the spacer
   information of the four-phase one is eliminated, which significantly
   improves the network throughput. By using the proposed packet structure,
   the phase information of header and tail flits is uniquely determined.
   Since the router can be asynchronously controlled by ignoring the phase
   information, the circuit is compactly implemented. As a result, the
   proposed asynchronous NoC router on a 0.13-mu m CMOS technology, has a
   90 percent increase in throughput and a 34 percent decrease in energy
   dissipation with 25 percent area overhead in comparison with a
   conventional four-phase asynchronous NoC router under a postlayout
   simulation. Under a random traffic pattern in a 4 x 4 2D mesh topology,
   the proposed asynchronous NoC has a 140 percent increase in throughput
   and half packet latency compared with the conventional one. We also
   fabricate the asynchronous NoC based on the proposed router on a 0.13-mu
   m CMOS technology and demonstrate the chip correctly operates under a
   supply voltage of 0.6 to 1.8 V.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to provide a relationship of how the key operational
   variables of frother type and impeller speed affect the size of bubble
   (D (32)). The study was performed using pilot-scale equipment (0.8 m(3))
   that is up to two orders of magnitude larger than equipment used for
   studies performed to date by others, and incorporated the key process
   variables of frother type and impeller speed. The results show that each
   frother family exhibits a unique CCC95-HLB relationship dependent on n
   (number of C-atoms in alkyl group) and m (number of propylene oxide
   group). Empirical models were developed to predict CCC95 from HLB
   associated with other two parameters alpha and beta. The impeller
   speed-bubble size tests show that D (32) is unaffected by increased
   impeller tip speed across the range of 4.6 to 9.2 m/s (representing the
   industrial operating range), although D (32) starts to increase below
   4.6 m/s. The finding is valid for both coalescing and non-coalescing
   conditions. The results suggest that the bubble size and bubble size
   distribution (BSD) being created do not change with increasing impeller
   speed in the quiescent zone of the flotation.}},

Title = {{Modeling gravitational collapse of rectangular granular piles in air and
   water}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The present paper is concerned with the two-dimensional collapse of
   piles of granular materials, a problem analogous to the classical dam
   break problem in hydraulics. This study is intended to aid in the
   development of constitutive equations and modeling procedures that can
   be applied to predict various flows involving high concentration
   liquid-particle mixtures. We consider the granular collapse as a test
   problem and attempt to validate our modeling by comparing our
   predictions with previously published granular collapse experiments. The
   time-dependent evolution of the collapsing granular piles is calculated
   by making use of COMSOL, a commercial finite element code that is
   designed to handle a wide variety of Multiphysics problems. We begin by
   considering the collapse of a rectangular block of dry granular material
   and calculate the temporal evolution of the free surface by making use
   of the Level Set method. Good agreement is found between these
   predictions and the laboratory experiments of Balmforth and Kerswell
   (2005). The collapse of granular material submerged in a water is then
   investigated using a Mixture Model approach. The experiments of Rondon
   et al. (2011) revealed drastically different collapse periods depending
   upon whether the initial pile was in a loose or a dense, compacted
   state. The simple Mixture Model approach gave reasonably good
   predictions of the Rondon et al. (2011) experiments for the case of
   initially loose piles that collapsed in about a second, but it was
   unsuccessful in simulating the collapse of the initially dense piles
   that were observed by Rondon et al. (2011) to take around 30-40s. Some
   simple empirical modifications to the material constitutive behavior
   were able to roughly predict such long collapse times, but a more
   comprehensive and detailed investigation of the phenomenon is warranted.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of
   reinforced concrete (RC) T-beams strengthened in shear with externally
   bonded (EB) carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips and sheets.
   The main objective of this study was to gain insight, by varying the
   test parameters, into the interaction between the internal transverse
   steel reinforcement and the externally bonded CFRP used for
   strengthening of RC beams in shear. The test parameters of this study
   were: 1) the CFRP ratio (that is, the spacing of the CFRP strips); 2)
   the presence or absence of transverse steel; 3) the transverse steel
   ratio (that is, the spacing of the stirrups); and 4) the use of CFRP
   strips versus CFRP sheets. In total, 10 tests were performed on 4520 mm
   (14 ft, 10 in.) long T-beams. The study showed that the presence of
   internal transverse steel reinforcement resulted in a significant
   decrease in the gain due to CFRP for all strengthened specimens. It also
   showed that the steel yielded before failure for all test specimens with
   transverse steel. Finally, the presence of CFRP did not result in a
   significant decrease in transverse steel strain. It can be concluded
   that the contribution of transverse steel to shear resistance is not
   affected by the addition of EB CFRP. These results are in good agreement
   with the assumptions made by existing codes and design guidelines, which
   are based on the yielding of transverse steel at ultimate strain for RC
   beams strengthened in shear with EB CFRP.}},

Abstract = {{To characterize the coupling effect between patient flow to access the
   emergency department (ED) and that to access the inpatient unit (IU), we
   develop a model with two connected queues: one upstream queue for the
   patient flow to access the ED and one downstream queue for the patient
   flow to access the IU. Building on this patient flow model, we employ
   queueing theory to estimate the average waiting time across patients.
   Using priority specific wait time targets, we further estimate the
   necessary number of ED and IU resources. Finally, we investigate how an
   alternative way of accessing ED (Fast Track) impacts the average waiting
   time of patients as well as the necessary number of ED/IU resources.
   This model as well as the analysis on patient flow can help the designer
   or manager of a hospital make decisions on the allocation of ED/IU
   resources in a hospital.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the precoding designs to maximize the weighted
   sum-rate (WSR) in a multicell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   broadcast channel (BC). We consider a multicell network under universal
   frequency reuse with multiple mobile stations (MS) per cell. With
   interference coordination (IC) between the multiple cells, the
   base-station (BS) at each cell only transmits information signals to the
   MSs within its cell using the dirty paper coding (DPC) technique, while
   coordinating the intercell interference (ICI) induced to other cells.
   The main focus of this work is to jointly optimize the encoding
   covariance matrices across the BSs in order to maximize the
   network-wideWSR. Since this optimization problem is shown to be
   nonconvex, obtaining its globally optimal solution is highly
   complicated. To address this problem, we consider two low-complexity
   solution approaches with distributed implementation to obtain at least
   locally optimal solutions. In the first approach, by applying a
   successive convex approximation technique, the original nonconvex
   problem is decomposed into a sequence of simpler problems, which can be
   solved optimally and separately at each BS. In the second approach, the
   WSR problem is solved via an equivalent problem of weighted sum mean
   squared error minimization. Both solution approaches will unfold the
   control signaling among the coordinated BSs to allow their distributed
   implementation. Simulation results confirm the convergence of the
   proposed algorithms, as well as their superior performances over schemes
   with linear precoding or no interference coordination among the BSs.}},

Abstract = {{We use a computational homogenisation approach to derive a non linear

Abstract = {{The paper deals with developing and testing frequency-adaptive PMU
   algorithms with wider linearity range than specified in IEEE Std
   C37.118-1. This goal is achieved by means of three different concepts
   encompassing robust state-of-the-art design approaches: 1) FIR bandpass
   filtering, 2) extended Kalman filtering (EKF), and 3) discrete Fourier
   transform (DFT) demodulation with FIR low-pass smoothing. While
   FIR-based PMUs are linear phase with no overshoot in either phase or
   amplitude step responses, the adaptive EKF PMU is more
   computer-intensive but allows for a reduced group delay and better
   out-of-band interference rejection at the cost of a phase step response
   with overshoot. Frequency measurement performances of the various PMUs
   are assessed in detail. It turned out that FIR PMUs are best for meeting
   Std C37-118-1 metrics but they are outperformed by EKF under changing
   harmonics. Test results on three recent commercial PMU models further
   confirm that PMU algorithms meeting standard C37-118-1 can behave quite
   differently under dynamic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Tools for engineers who assess and optimize hydropower intakes are

   processes that affect their generation and strength. Common mechanisms
   that produce and strengthen the vortices (flow separation, shear,
   asymmetric approach flow) are discussed. An analytical model, based on
   Burgers's vortex model and laboratory measurements, is described that
   incorporates the effect of the approach flow and intake geometry on
   vortex characteristics. Simple measurement techniques (acoustic Doppler
   velocimetry and surface particle tracking velocimetry) are presented by
   which the flow and vortex characteristics can be documented, allowing
   the model to be adjusted to the particularities of the specific intake
   under consideration. The analytical model is then used to help

Abstract = {{Thermodynamics and kinetics of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
   (NAD(+)) adsorption on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode surface was
   investigated at various electrode potentials and NAD(+) concentrations
   using differential capacitance (DC) and attenuated total reflection
   Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) techniques. Equilibrium adsorption
   measurements confirmed that NAD(+) spontaneously and strongly adsorbs on
   the GC electrode surface. The affinity of NAD(+) towards adsorption on
   the GC electrode surface was found to increase with an increase in
   electrode potential (charge) to more positive values; the corresponding
   apparent Gibbs free energy of adsorption was -32.80 +/- 0.25, -35.61 +/-
   0.86, and -38.02 +/- 0.40 kJ mol(-1) on negatively, neutral, and
   positively charged electrode surfaces, respectively. The kinetics of
   NAD(+) adsorption is also found to be highly dependent on the electrode
   surface potential (charge), and it increases with an increase in
   electrode potential (charge) to positive values. The adsorption process
   was modeled using a two-step kinetic model, in which the adsorption
   process involves the formation of two forms of NAD(+) on the surface:
   the thermodynamically unstable (NAD(+) (ads,rev)) and stable (NAD(+)
   (ads,stable)) forms. ATR-FTIR further confirmed that NAD(+), indeed,

Abstract = {{Plant petioles and stems are hierarchical cellular structures,
   displaying geometrical features defined at multiple length scales. One
   or more of the intermediate hierarchical levels consists of tissues in
   which the cellular distribution is quasi-random, a factor that affects
   the elastic properties of the tissues. The current work focuses on the
   finite element analysis (FEA) of the constituent tissues of the plant
   Rheum rhabarbarum (rhubarb). The geometric model is generated via a
   recently introduced method: the finite edge centroidal Voronoi
   tessellation (FECVT), which is capable to capture the gradients of
   cellularity and diversified pattern of cellular materials, as opposed to
   current approaches in literature. The effective stiffness of the tissues
   is obtained by using an accurate numerical homogenization technique via
   detailed finite element analysis of the models of sub-regions of the
   tissues. As opposed to a large-scale representative volume element
   (RVE), statistical volume elements (SVE) are considered in this work to
   model tissue microstructures that are highly random. 2D finite element
   analyses demonstrate that the distribution of cells in collenchyma and
   parenchyma tissue make them stiffer in two different directions, while
   the overall effect of the combined tissues results in approximately
   equal stiffness in both directions. The rhubarb tissues, on the other
   hand, are more compliant than periodic and quasi-uniform random cellular
   materials by a factor of up to 47\% and 44\%, respectively. The
   variations of the stiffness shows the stiffening role that cell shape,
   size, and graded cellular distribution play in the mechanics of the
   rhubarb tissue. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Marbling is an important quality attribute of pork. Detection of pork
   marbling usually involves subjective scoring, which raises the
   efficiency costs to the processor. In this study, the ability to predict
   pork marbling using near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging (900-1700
   nm) and the proper image processing techniques were studied.
   Near-infrared images were collected from pork after marbling evaluation
   according to current standard chart from the National Pork Producers
   Council. Image analysis techniques-Gabor filter, wide line detector, and
   spectral averaging-were applied to extract texture, line, and spectral
   features, respectively, from NIR images of pork. Samples were grouped
   into calibration and validation sets. Wavelength selection was performed
   on calibration set by stepwise regression procedure. Prediction models
   of pork marbling scores were built using multiple linear regressions
   based on derivatives of mean spectra and line features at key
   wavelengths. The results showed that the derivatives of both texture and
   spectral features produced good results, with correlation coefficients
   of validation of 0.90 and 0.86, respectively, using wavelengths of 961,
   1186, and 1220 nm. The results revealed the great potential of the Gabor
   filter for analyzing NIR images of pork for the effective and efficient
   objective evaluation of pork marbling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a reordered overlapped search mechanism for
   high-throughput low-energy content-addressable memories (CAMs). Most
   mismatches can be found by searching a few bits of a search word. To
   lower power dissipation, a word circuit is often divided into two
   sections that are sequentially searched or even pipelined. Because of
   this process, most of match lines in the second section are unused.
   Since searching the last few bits is very fast compared to searching the
   rest of the bits, we propose to increase throughput by asynchronously
   initiating second-stage searches on the unused match lines as soon as a
   first-stage search is complete. In our circuit implementation, each word
   circuit is independently controlled by a locally generated timing signal
   rather than a global signal. This allows the circuits to be in the
   required phase for their own local operation: evaluate or precharge,
   instead of having to synchronize their phase to the rest of the word
   circuits, which greatly reduces the cycle time. As a design example, a
   128 64-bit CAM is implemented and evaluated by HSPICE simulation under a
   90 nm CMOS technology. The proposed asynchronous CAM operates 5.98 times
   faster than a synchronous CAM with 14.2\% smaller energy dissipation.
   The post-layout proposed CAM achieves 385-ps cycle delay time and 0.773
   fJ/bit/search and is also evaluated under different corner conditions
   and PVT variations to guarantee it operates properly.}},

Title = {{Minimum sliding mode error feedback control for fault tolerant

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{Minimum Sliding Mode Error Feedback Control (MSMEFC) is proposed to
   improve the control precision of spacecraft formations based on the
   conventional sliding mode control theory. This paper proposes a new
   approach to estimate and offset the system model errors, which include
   various kinds of uncertainties and disturbances, as well as smoothes out
   the effect of nonlinear switching control terms. To facilitate the
   analysis, the concept of equivalent control error is introduced, which
   is the key to the utilization of MSMEFC. A cost function is formulated
   on the basis of the principle of minimum sliding mode error; then the
   equivalent control error is estimated and fed back to the conventional
   sliding mode control. It is shown that the sliding mode after the MSMEFC
   will approximate to the ideal sliding mode, resulting in improved
   control performance and quality. The new methodology is applied to
   spacecraft formation flying. It guarantees global asymptotic convergence
   of the relative tracking error in the presence of J(2) perturbations. In
   addition, some fault tolerant situations such as thruster failure for a
   period of time, thruster degradation and so on, are also considered to
   verify the effectiveness of MSMEFC. Numerical simulations are performed
   to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology to maintain and
   reconfigure the satellite formation with the existence of initial
   offsets and J(2) perturbation effects, even in the fault-tolerant cases.

Abstract = {{Background aims. Non-obese diabetic mice (NOD) exhibit autoimmune
   Sjogren-like disease (SS-like). We reported previously that a
   combined-therapy consisting of immuno- and cell-based therapy rescued
   NOD from SS-like. However, therapies tested to date on NOD mice were
   aimed at the initial phase of SS-like. It is unknown whether therapies
   are effective in restoring salivary function when given at an advanced
   phase of SS-like. Methods. The efficacy of two therapies (bone marrow
   versus spleen cells) was compared head-to-head for halting/reversing
   salivary hypofunction at two critical time points of SS-like (7-week-old
   NOD with normal saliva output and 20-week-old NOD with minimal saliva).
   NOD mice were divided into four groups: (i) control, (ii) complete
   Freund's adjuvant (CFA), (iii) bone marrow transplants with CFA or (iv)
   spleen cell transplants with CFA. Mice were monitored 8-12 months after
   therapy. Results. Both cell therapies were effective during the initial
   phase of SS-like; salivary flow rates were maintained between 80-100\%
   of pre-symptomatic levels. Spleen cell therapy was better than bone
   marrow when administered in the initial phase of SS-like. When cell
   therapies were given at an advanced phase of SS-like (20 weeks and
   older), salivary flow rates improved but were at best 50\% of
   pre-symptomatic levels. Both cell therapies decreased tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta 1 levels and T and B cells
   while increasing epidermal growth factor and regulatory T cells.
   Elevated serum epidermal growth factor levels were measured in
   spleen-treated mice. Conclusions. A therapeutic effect in advanced phase
   disease, albeit in mice, holds promise for humans in which Sjogren
   syndrome is generally not diagnosed until a late stage.}},

Abstract = {{We use real-number codes to compress statistically dependent sources and
   establish a new framework for distributed lossy source coding in which
   we compress sources before, rather than after, quantization. This change
   in the order of binning and quantization blocks makes it possible to
   model the correlation between continuous-valued sources more
   realistically and compensate for the quantization error partially. We
   then focus on the asymmetric case, i.e., lossy source coding with side
   information at the decoder. The encoding and decoding procedures are
   described in detail for a class of real-number codes called discrete
   Fourier transform (DFT) codes, both for the syndrome- and parity-based
   approaches. We leverage subspace-based decoding to improve the decoding
   and by extending it we are able to perform distributed source coding in
   a rate-adaptive fashion to further improve the decoding performance when
   the statistical dependency between sources is unknown. We also extend
   the parity-based approach to the case where the transmission channel is
   noisy and thus we perform distributed joint source-channel coding in
   this context. The proposed system is well suited for low-delay
   communications, as the mean-squared reconstruction error (MSE) is shown
   to be reasonably low for very short block length.}},

Title = {{Response of critical tube diameter phenomenon to small perturbations for

Journal = {{SHOCK WAVES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{219-229}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this experimental study, the critical tube diameter phenomenon of
   gaseous detonations is investigated in both stable and unstable mixtures
   with focus on the failure mechanism. It was previously postulated that
   in unstable mixtures, where the cellular detonation front is highly
   irregular, the failure is caused by the suppression of local
   re-initiation centers linked to the dynamics of instabilities. In stable
   mixtures, typically with high argon dilution, the detonation structure
   is very regular and the failure mode is attributed to the excessive
   curvature of the global front. In order to differentiate between these
   two failure mechanisms, flow perturbations are introduced by placing an
   obstacle resulting in a minimal blockage ratio of approximately 8 \%.
   The obstacle is placed at the tube exit, before the detonation
   diffraction. Results show that the perturbations caused by the obstacle
   only have an effect on undiluted (i.e., unstable) mixtures, causing a
   decrease in the minimum initial pressure required for successful
   detonation transmission. This thus demonstrates that local hydrodynamic
   instabilities play an important role for the critical tube diameter
   phenomenon in undiluted, unstable mixtures. In contrast, the results for
   the stable, argon-diluted mixture exhibit little variation in critical
   initial pressure between the perturbed and unperturbed cases. This can
   be attributed to the minimal effect of the perturbations on global
   curvature for the emergent detonation wave. The geometry of the
   perturbation is also tested, while holding the blockage area constant,
   by varying the number and position of the obstacle(s). The results
   demonstrate that the transmission of a detonation is independent of the
   blockage geometry and is only a function of its imposed blockage area.
   Consequently, the change in required minimum pressure for transmission
   shows an identical behavior in unstable mixtures for different
   perturbation geometries while the transmission characteristics of the
   stable mixture remain unaffected.}},

   microstructure and texture evolution and thereby on bendability was
   investigated in an ultrahigh-strength strip steel with a
   martensitic-bainitic microstructure. The results indicate that an
   increase in rolling reduction (R (tot)) below the non-recrystallization
   temperature, which improves the strength and toughness properties,
   increases the intensities of the similar to\{554\}aOE (c) 225 > (alpha)

   strip centerline and of the similar to\{112\}aOE (c) 111 > (alpha)
   component at the surface region. Even with the highest R (tot) of 79
   pct, the bendability along the rolling direction was good, but the
   preferred alignment of rod-shaped MA constituents along the rolling
   direction led to a dramatic decrease in the bendability transverse to
   the rolling direction, with severe cracking occurring even at small
   bending angles. The early cracking is attributed to localization of the
   strain in narrow shear bands. It is concluded that the R-tot value has
   to be limited to guarantee successful bendability.}},

Title = {{Bayesian methodology to estimate and update safety performance functions
   under limited data conditions: A sensitivity analysis}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{In road safety studies, decision makers must often cope with limited
   data conditions. In such circumstances, the maximum likelihood
   estimation (MLE), which relies on asymptotic theory, is unreliable and
   prone to bias. Moreover, it has been reported in the literature that (a)
   Bayesian estimates might be significantly biased when using
   non-informative prior distributions under limited data conditions, and
   that (b) the calibration of limited data is plausible when existing
   evidence in the form of proper priors is introduced into analyses.
   Although the Highway Safety Manual (2010) (HSM) and other research
   studies provide calibration and updating procedures, the data
   requirements can be very taxing. This paper presents a practical and
   sound Bayesian method to estimate and/or update safety performance
   function (SPF) parameters combining the information available from
   limited data with the SPF parameters reported in the HSM. The proposed
   Bayesian updating approach has the advantage of requiring fewer
   observations to get reliable estimates. This paper documents this
   procedure. The adopted technique is validated by conducting a
   sensitivity analysis through an extensive simulation study with 15
   different models, which include various prior combinations. This
   sensitivity analysis contributes to our understanding of the comparative
   aspects of a large number of prior distributions. Furthermore, the
   proposed method contributes to unification of the Bayesian updating
   process for SPFs. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the developed
   methodology. Therefore, the suggested approach offers considerable
   promise as a methodological tool to estimate and/or update baseline SPFs
   and to evaluate the efficacy of road safety countermeasures under
   limited data conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of flow parameters through a bottom

   A physical model of the regulating bottom outlet of Shahryar dam in Iran

   Plexiglas, and discharge and pressure data were recorded for different
   gate openings. The Froude law of similarity was satisfied in the
   hydraulic modelling, allowing for an investigation of the dynamic
   similarity of inertial and gravitational forces. The numerical scheme
   was based on using the natural-element method to study hydraulic forces
   and flow parameters within the conduit and the finite-element method to
   evaluate the natural frequencies of the radial gate. The results of the
   calculations for different radial gate openings showed good agreement
   with those from physical modelling for the pressure distributions

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{80-89}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the relevance of straining of nano-sized particles of
   zero valent iron coated with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-NZVI) during
   transport in model subsurface porous media is assessed. Although
   deposition of polyelectrolyte stabilized-NZVI on granular subsurface
   media due to physicochemical attachment processes has been reported
   previously, there is limited knowledge on the significance of the
   collector (sand) diameter on the deposition and spatial distribution of
   the retention of such nanoparticles. Experiments were conducted to
   assess the transport of CMC-NZVI in columns packed with four
   different-sized sands of mean diameter of 775 gm, 510 gm, 250 gm and 150
   gm and at three different particle concentrations of 0.085 g L-1, 0.35 g
   L (1) and 1.70 g L-1. CMC-NZVI effluent concentrations decreased with
   smaller sand diameters. High CMC-NZVI particle retention near the inlet,
   particularly for the finer sands was observed, even with a low ionic
   strength of 0.1 mM for the electrolyte medium. These observations are
   consistent with particle retention in porous media due to straining
   and/or wedging. Two colloid transport models, one considering particle
   retention by physicochemical deposition and detachment of those
   deposited particles, and the other considering particle retention by
   straining along with particle deposition and detachment, were fitted to
   the experimental data. The model accounting for straining shows a better
   fit, especially to the CMC-NZVI retention data along the length of the
   column. The straining rate coefficients decreased with larger sand
   diameters. This study demonstrates that CMC-NZVI particles, despite of
   their small size (hydrodynamic diameters of 167-185 nm and transmission
   electron microscopy imaged diameters of approximately 85 nm), may be
   removed by straining during transport, especially through fine granular
   subsurface media. The tailing effect, observed in the particle
   breakthrough curves, is attributed to detachment of deposited particles.

Abstract = {{An increase in the frequency of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in
   bacteria including Escherichia coli could be a threat to public health.
   This study investigated the impact of activated sludge and
   physicochemical wastewater treatment processes on the prevalence of ARGs
   in E. coli isolates. In total, 719 E. coli were isolated from the
   influent and effluent (prior to disinfection) of two activated sludge
   and two physicochemical municipal treatment plants, and genotyped using
   DNA microarrays. Changes in the abundance of ARGs in the E. coli
   population were different for the two treatment processes. Activated
   sludge treatment did not change the prevalence of ARG-possessing E. coli
   but increased the abundance of ARGs in the E. coli genome while
   physicochemical treatment reduced both the prevalence of ARG-carrying E.
   coli as well as the frequency of ARGs in the E. coli genome. Most E.
   coli isolates from the four treatment plants possessed ARGs of multiple
   antimicrobial classes, mainly aminoglycoside, beta-lactams, quinolone
   and tetracyclines. In addition these isolates harboured DNA insertion
   sequence elements including integrase and transposase. A significant
   positive association was found between the occurrence of ARGs and

Abstract = {{The development of bio-based films from proteins for their utilization
   as packaging materials and composites has gained popularity due to the
   availability, renewable nature, and biodegradability of proteins. The
   most studied of these polymers is sourced from soy. However, other
   sources of proteins show great commercial potential when transformed
   into films. As such, zein from corn and keratin from low-value chicken
   feather can be plasticized into films which exhibit good mechanical
   properties. Films derived from pea proteins can resist UV light
   transmission due to the presence of disulfide bonds within the network
   and the presence of amino acids such as tyrosine, tryptophan, and
   phenylalanine. Proteins from rapeseed have not been extensively studied
   as feedstocks for bio-based films but show great potential since their
   amino acid composition is similar to soy proteins. This review aims at
   combining and condensing the body of research performed on the synthesis
   of zein-, keratin-, pea-, canola-, and rapeseed-based films. The
   structural diversity of these proteins highly influences their
   processing methods and the physical properties of the resulting films.
   The potential applications of these bio-based materials are also
   highlighted.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2782-2793}},

Abstract = {{Records of natural processes, such as gradual streamflow fluctuations,
   are commonly interrupted by long or short disruptions from natural
   non-linear responses to gradual changes, such as from river-ice
   break-ups, freezing as a result of annual solar cycles, or human causes,
   such as flow blocking by dams and other means, instrument calibrations
   and failure. The resulting abrupt or gradual shifts and missing data are
   considered to be discontinuities with respect to the normal signal. They
   differ from random noise as they do not follow any fixed distribution
   over time and, hence, cannot be eliminated by filtering. The multi-scale
   resolution features of continuous wavelet analysis and cross wavelet
   analysis were used in this study to determine the amplitude and timing
   of such streamflow discontinuities for specific wavebands. The cross
   wavelet based method was able to detect the strength and timing of
   abrupt shifts to new streamflow levels, gaps in data records longer than
   the waveband of interest and a sinusoidal discontinuity curve following
   an underlying modeled annual signal at +/- 0.5year uncertainty.
   Parameter testing of the time-frequency resolution demonstrated that
   high temporal resolution using narrow analysis windows is favorable to
   high-frequency resolution for detection of waveband-related
   discontinuities. Discontinuity analysis on observed daily streamflow
   records from Canadian rivers showed the following: (i) that there is at
   least one discontinuity/year related to the annual spring flood in each
   record studied, and (ii) neighboring streamflows have similar
   discontinuity patterns. In addition, the discontinuity density of the
   Canadian streamflows studied in this paper exhibit11-yearcycles that are
   inversely correlated with the solar intensity cycle. This suggests that
   more streamflow discontinuities, such as through fast freezing,
   snowmelt, or ice break-up, may occur during years with slightly lowered
   solar insolation. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Having acquired near infrared (NIR) hyperspectral images of intact pork
   loin samples through an NIR hyperspectral imaging system, the efficiency
   of a variety of image processing techniques including texture pattern
   analysis techniques were applied to process hyperspectral images so as
   to determine the intramuscular fat (IMF) content non-destructively.
   After the segmentation of region of interest (ROI), the raw spectral,
   texture-based spectral and textural characteristics of pork images were
   extracted by spectral averaging and pattern recognition techniques
   namely Gabor filter and improved gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM),
   respectively. First derivatives of the non-filtered and the Gabor
   filtered spectra were also investigated. Full waveband partial least
   squares regression (PLSR) was employed to determine the optimal
   parameters of Gabor filter and GLCM, and to select optimal wavelengths
   for IMF prediction. A stepwise procedure was applied to the optimal
   wavelengths to further optimize them to key wavelengths. Multiple linear
   regression (MLR) models were built based on the key wavelengths. Mean
   spectra and the Gabor filtered spectra outperformed GLCM. The best
   result, represented by correlation coefficients of calibration (Rc),
   cross validation (Rcv) and prediction (Rp) of 0.89, 0.89, and 0.86,
   respectively, was achieved using the first derivative of Gabor filtered
   spectra at 1193 and 1217 nm. To visualize the IMF content in pork, the
   distribution maps of IMF content in pork were drawn using a mean
   spectra-based MLR model. These promising results highlight the great
   potential of NIR hyperspectral imaging for non-destructive prediction of
   IMF content of intact pork. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was performed to investigate the behaviour of
   angle shear connectors embedded in high strength concrete (HSC) slab.
   Eight push-out specimens were tested covering various geometries of
   angle shear connector. On top of the experimental study, the accuracy of
   the available equations to estimate the load capacities of angle
   connectors is also evaluated for the angles embedded in HSC. The results
   show inadequate ductility behaviour for the angle shear connectors
   embedded in HSC. Nonetheless, the angle connectors exhibited good
   behaviour in the case of strength degradation under cyclic loading. All
   specimens experienced the angle fracture type of failure and showed a
   very low strength degradation (0.1\%-1.4\%) when they were subjected to
   low cyclic fatigue loading. This study also concludes that the current
   available equations estimated the shear capacity of angle connectors
   embedded in HSC either are conservative or overestimate the ultimate
   capacity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Legionellosis has been and continues to be a life-threatening disease
   worldwide, even in developed countries. Given the severity and
   unpredictability of Legionellosis outbreaks, developing a rapid, highly
   specific, and sensitive detection method is thus of great pertinence. In
   this paper, we demonstrate that sub-femtomole levels of 16s rRNA from
   pathogenic Legionella pneumophila can be timely and effectively detected
   using an appropriate designed capture, detector probes, and a QD SPRi
   signal amplification strategy. To achieve specific and sensitive
   detection, optimal hybridization conditions and parameters were
   implemented. Among these parameters, fragmentation of the 16s rRNA and
   further signal amplification by QDs were found to be the main parameters
   contributing to signal enhancement. The appropriate design of the
   detector probes also increased the sensitivity of the detection system,
   mainly due to secondary structure of 16s rRNA. The use of 16s rRNA from
   L. pneumophila allowed for the detection of metabolically active
   pathogens with high sensitivity. Detection of 16s rRNA in solutions as
   diluted as 1 pM at 450 mu L (0.45 femtomole) was achieved in less than 3
   h, making our approach suitable for the direct, timely, and effective
   detection of L. pneumophila within man-made water systems. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of positive piezoresistance in
   high aspect ratio particle based polymer nanocomposites, a hybrid system
   at the center of research on flexible piezoresistive materials. We
   introduce a percolation theory based model relating the variation in
   electrical resistance to compressive strain and show that it gives
   accurate theoretical fits to experimental data presented in this paper,
   as well as to much of the available data in the literature. In contrast
   to existing theories, the model captures the characteristics of the
   particle network through experimentally definable parameters and does
   not rely on.. assumptions regarding the nature of the particles and/or
   the configuration of the network. It is further demonstrated that the
   presented theoretical framework is not limited to polymer nanocomposites
   with high aspect ratio particle but that it can explain piezoresistance
   in bulk electroconductive polymer nanocomposites in general. We find
   that the piezoresistive effect in such materials is rooted in a
   mechanical deformation induced change in the distribution of local
   conductances within the particle network, and we show that this change
   in the distribution of local conductances is well described by a strain
   dependent conductivity exponent, which scales with the magnitude of
   mechanical deformation. Besides, we demonstrate that these findings can
   be applied to the experimentally observed concentration dependence of
   the piezoresistance in polymer nanocomposites and, thus, to predicting
   the electric response to mechanical deformation at any particle
   concentration, which is expected to be highly instrumental in applied
   materials selection and performance evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a low-complexity format-transparent digital

   performance is numerically and experimentally evaluated in a dual

   scheme, we conduct a system-level study of Tb/s bandwidth-adaptive
   superchannel transmissions with flexible modulation formats including
   QPSK, 8QAM and 16QAM. The spectrum bandwidth allocation is realized in
   the digital domain instead of turning on/off sub-channels, which
   improves the performance of higher order QAM. Various transmission
   distances ranging from 240 km to 6240 km are demonstrated with a

Abstract = {{We explore one-point and two-point statistics of the Navier-Stokes-alpha
   beta regularization model at moderate Reynolds number (Re approximate to
   200) in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The results are compared to
   the limit cases of the Navier-Stokes-alpha model and the
   Navier-Stokes-alpha beta model without subgrid-scale stress, as well as
   with high-resolution direct numerical simulation. After reviewing
   spectra of different energy norms of the Navier-Stokes-alpha beta model,
   the Navier-Stokes-alpha model, and Navier-Stokes-alpha beta model
   without subgrid-scale stress, we present probability density functions
   and normalized probability density functions of the filtered and
   unfiltered velocity increments along with longitudinal velocity
   structure functions of the regularization models and direct numerical
   simulation results. We highlight differences in the statistical
   properties of the unfiltered and filtered velocity fields entering the
   governing equations of the Navier-Stokes-alpha and Navier-Stokes-alpha
   beta models and discuss the usability of both velocity fields for
   realistic flow predictions. The influence of the modified viscous term
   in the Navier-Stokes-alpha beta model is studied through comparison to
   the case where the underlying subgrid-scale stress tensor is neglected.
   Whereas, the filtered velocity field is found to have physically more
   viable probability density functions and structure functions for the
   approximation of direct numerical simulation results, the unfiltered
   velocityfield is found to have flatness factors close to direct
   numerical simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical model was developed in order to predict the size of
   agglomerates ejected from aluminized composite solid propellants. The
   model accounts for aspects of both mechanistic and geometric approaches.
   A thin mobile surface layer is assumed to dominate particle
   accumulation. Agglomeration number N-ag expressing the ratio between
   ignition and accumulation times, was found to greatly affect the
   characteristics of agglomeration phenomena, as noted in previous works.
   The concept of a characteristic distance D-e of the mobile surface layer
   was introduced, depending mostly on coarse AP particle diameter and
   loading. It was found to have a significant effect on the resulting
   agglomerate diameter. An agglomeration threshold was defined as the
   particle diameter equal to the mobile layer thickness. Particles smaller
   than this threshold have shown tendency to form large agglomerates,
   whereas particles with a somewhat larger diameter have demonstrated
   faster ignition and smaller ejected agglomerates. Model predictions for
   a number of propellant compositions showed good agreement with other
   theoretical studies as well as with experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Immunoassays are indispensable for research and clinical analysis, and
   following the emergence of the omics paradigm, multiplexing of
   immunoassays is more needed than ever. Cross-reactivity (CR) in
   multiplexed immunoassays has been unexpectedly difficult to mitigate,
   preventing scaling up of multiplexing, limiting assay performance, and
   resulting in inaccurate and even false results, and wrong conclusions.
   Here, we review CR and its consequences in single and dual antibody
   single-plex and multiplex assays. We establish a distinction between
   sample-driven and reagent-driven CR, and describe how it affects the
   performance of antibody microarrays. Next, we review and evaluate
   various platforms aimed at mitigating CR, including SOMAmers and protein
   fractionation-bead assays, as well as dual Ab methods including (i)
   conventional multiplex assays, (ii) proximity ligation assays, (iii)
   immuno-mass spectrometry, (iv) sequential multiplex analyte capture, (v)
   antibody colocalization microarrays and (vi) force discrimination

Abstract = {{Allergy, also termed type I hypersensitivity, is defined as a ``disease
   following a response by the immune system to an otherwise innocuous
   antigen{''}. The prevalence of allergies is high and escalating, with
   almost half the populations of North America and Europe having allergies
   to one or more common environmental antigens. Although rarely
   life-threatening allergies cause much distress and pose an important
   economic burden. Recent studies demonstrate the importance of the
   commensal bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract, termed the microbiota,
   in stimulating and modulating the immune system. This goes hand-in-hand
   with the hygiene hypothesis, proposed by Strachan in 1989. With this in
   mind, the use of pre- and probiotics has gained interest to prevent and
   treat allergies through modulation of the gut microbiota and the immune
   system. Probiotics, namely Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, are live
   microorganisms that can be incorporated in the diet in the form of
   functional foods or dietary supplements to beneficially influence the
   host. In recent studies, probiotic formulations demonstrated the
   capability to successfully modulate allergic rhinitis, atopic disorders
   and food-related allergies. A number of probiotic mechanisms of action
   are involved in controlling hypersensitivity responses, many of which
   are still not yet understood. Microencapsulation has gained importance
   as a device for the oral delivery of probiotic cells and may play an
   important role in the development of a successful probiotic formulation
   to treat and prevent allergies. Despite the promising research on
   probiotic biotherapeutics, further investigations are required to
   develop a successful therapeutic to treat and prevent allergies.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{19-29}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Fault slip bursts induced by mining activities could inflict severe
   damage to nearby mine developments. Considering a variety of factors
   that might exert an influence on the fault slip, dynamic numerical
   analyses are conducted for models having a fault parallel to a tabular
   ore deposit. The results obtained from the analyses show that the
   maximum dynamic shear displacement increment induced by stope extraction
   is significantly affected by the friction angle of the fault, as well as
   mining depth and position of fault with respect to the orebody, while
   the stiffness and the dilation angle of the fault do not have as much
   influence. Seismic source parameters are computed based on the numerical
   results and as is the case with the maximum relative shear
   displacements, the position and friction angle of the fault appear to
   have the strongest influence on seismic moment and energy released by
   fault slip. The limitations of Mohr-Coulomb criterion as applied to the
   dynamic analysis of fault slip bursts are discussed in light of the
   results obtained. Lastly, slip rates and rupture velocity are
   investigated. The results show that the maximum slip rates are
   associated with the maximum increments of relative dynamic shear
   displacement. It is shown that extremely high rupture velocity could be
   induced by stope extraction. This could be the cause for a severe
   seismic event. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for solving shape optimization
   problems where the unknown is the shape of the problem domain. The
   proposed algorithm is based on minimization of the stress along the
   design boundary calculated by the Modified Fixed Grid Finite Element
   Method (MFGFEM). Using MFGFEM eliminates mesh adaptation and re-meshing
   processes, as needed in the standard finite element method, and reduces
   the analysis cost significantly. In this study, a new approach for
   computing the stiffness matrix of boundary intersecting elements is also
   presented and the optimal shape of the problem domain is obtained via a
   simple optimization algorithm. The performance of the proposed approach
   is investigated for shape optimization problems. It is concluded that
   the results of the present method are in good agreement with other
   analytical and finite element solutions. (C) 2014 Sharif University of

Abstract = {{Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), acquired simultaneously
   with electroencephalography (EEG), allows the investigation of
   hemodynamic brain responses to epileptic activity. Because the presumed
   epileptogenic focus is patient-specific, an appropriate source/detector
   (SD) montage has to be reconfigured for each patient. The combination of
   EEG and fNIRS, however, entails several constraints on montages, and
   finding an optimal arrangement of optodes on the cap is an important
   issue. We present a method for computing an optimal SD montage on an
   EEG/fNIRS cap that focuses on one or several specific brain regions; the
   montage maximizes the spatial sensitivity. We formulate this
   optimization problem as a linear integer programming problem. The method
   was evaluated on two EEG/fNIRS caps. We simulated absorbers at different
   locations on a head model and generated realistic optical density maps
   on the scalp. We found that the maps of optimal SD montages had spatial
   resolution properties comparable to those of regular SD arrangements for
   the whole head with significantly fewer sensors than regular SD
   arrangements. In addition, we observed that optimal montages yielded
   improved spatial density of fNIRS measurements over the targeted regions
   together with an increase in signal-to-noise ratio. (C) 2014 Society of

Title = {{The influence of Reynolds number on the triple point trajectories at
   shock reflection off cylindrical surfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{740}},
Pages = {{47-60}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In the unsteady process of shock reflection off convexly curved
   surfaces, the Reynolds number can have an influence on the development
   of the irregular reflection pattern. Time-resolved visualizations of the
   reflection process and high-resolution numerical simulation are used in
   this investigation to quantify this influence, which manifests itself in
   a delayed growth of the shock pattern with decreasing Reynolds number.
   In order to conduct reliable and unambiguous measurements, the present
   study concentrates on observing the development of the established
   irregular reflection pattern rather than attempting to determine the
   transition point directly. It can be seen that the influence of the
   Reynolds number is highly nonlinear and that changes of two orders of
   magnitude or more are required to produce a reliably measurable
   difference in the triple point trajectories, which is considerably more
   than what has so far been reported in the literature. The results allow
   one to make inferences regarding the transition process and they help to
   clarify previously reported discrepancies between predicted and
   experimentally determined transition angles.}},

Abstract = {{Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codes have been used to provide
   robustness against errors and erasures in various applications. This
   paper focuses on improving error localization of the
   Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) DFT codes. First, we analyze how the
   subspace-based error localization outperforms the coding-theoretic one.
   Then, we propose an extension of the subspace-based error localization,
   based on additional syndrome, that improves the existing one and is
   naturally suitable for rate-adaptive distributed source coding (DSC).
   Further, we propose a new generic subspace-based algorithm to decode
   BCH-DFT codes. The proposed approach generalizes the encoding and
   decoding of this important class of DFT codes. It introduces many
   different decoding matrices for a DFT code; this diversity is then used
   to diminish the effect of the quantization noise and thus to improve the
   decoding. Finally, the extended and generalized approaches are combined
   to maximize the decoding gain. Simulation results demonstrate the
   capability of the proposed algorithms to perform significantly better
   than the existing subspace-based error localization, in the presence of
   quantization noise.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies a multiuser multicell system where
   block-diagonalization (BD) precoding is utilized on a per-cell basis. We
   examine and compare the multicell system under two operating modes:
   competition and coordination. In the competition mode, the paper
   considers a strategic noncooperative game (SNG), where each base-station
   (BS) greedily determines its BD precoding strategy in a distributed
   manner, based on the knowledge of the inter-cell interference at its
   connected mobile-stations (MS). Via the game-theory framework, the
   existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium in this SNG are
   subsequently studied. In the coordination mode, the BD precoders are
   jointly designed across the multiple BSs to maximize the network
   weighted sum-rate (WSR). Since this WSR maximization problem is
   nonconvex, we consider a distributed algorithm to obtain at least a
   locally optimal solution. Finally, we extend our analysis of the
   multicell BD precoding to the case of BD-Dirty Paper Coding (BD-DPC)
   precoding. We characterize BD-DPC precoding game for the multicell
   system in the competition mode and propose an algorithm to jointly
   optimize BD-DPC precoders for the multicell system in the coordination
   mode. Simulation results show significant network sum-rate improvements
   by jointly designing the BD or BD-DPC precoders across the multicell
   system in the coordination mode over the competition mode.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the capacity of the static half-duplex
   single-relay amplify-and-forward (AF) system under both per-node and
   joint power constraints. Different from multiple-input multiple-output
   systems, the channel matrix of the cooperative AF system is a function
   of the parameters to be optimized and hence water-filling over the
   square of the singular values is no longer optimal. Furthermore, given
   that the mutual information of the AF system is not a concave function,
   conventional optimization methods cannot be applied. Instead, by
   deriving and comparing all local solutions, we characterize the optimal
   input covariance matrix at the source and the optimal power allocation
   scheme at the relay that maximize the achievable rate. First, for the
   individual power constraint scenario, it is shown that the capacity of
   the AF system is achieved by either a direct transmission (DT) scheme, a
   non-orthogonal AF (NAF) beamforming (BF) protocol with a unit-rank
   covariance matrix, or a NAF system using a specific full-rank covariance
   matrix. Then, for the global power constraint scenario, it is shown that
   only a DT or a NAF-BF protocol can achieve the capacity. In both cases,
   orthogonal transmission is strictly suboptimal. The capacity of the AF
   system is finally analyzed for some concrete examples, such as under
   asymptotically high and low transmission powers and for several network
   models.}},

   properties, a versatile, cost effective, and easy-to-operate microchip
   with the capability to simultaneously separate, capture, pattern, and
   culture rare and primary cells in vitro is developed. The platform is
   based on target cell adhesion onto the micro-fabricated interfaces
   produced by microcontact printing of cell-specific antibodies. Results
   show over 95\% separation efficiency in less than 10 min for the
   separation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and cardiomyocytes
   from rat brain and heart mixtures, respectively. Target cell attachment
   and single cell spreading can be precisely controlled on the basis of
   the designed patterns. Both cell types can maintain their
   biofunctionality. Indeed, isolated OPCs can proliferate and
   differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, while isolated
   cardiomyocytes retain their contractile properties on the separation
   platform. Successful separation of two dissimilar cell types present in
   varying concentrations in their respective cell mixtures and the

   optimum solution by applying an approach based on multiobjective
   optimization. The differential evolution technique, a stochastic method,
   widely known for the ease of use and its ability to handle adequately
   non-differentiable, non-linear, and multimodal cost functions was used.
   The proposed framework provides a technique to optimize effectively HTS
   leads, which not only deals with the non-linear aspect of HTS materials,
   but also includes a multiphysics environment.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel parallel multigrid algorithm, referred to as the
   finite-element multigrid Gaussian belief propagation (FMGaBP), to
   accelerate the convergence of the recently introduced finite-element
   Gaussian belief propagation solver. The FMGaBP algorithm processes the
   FEM computation in a fully distributed and parallel manner, with
   stencil-like element-by-element operations, demonstrating high parallel
   efficiency. The results for both sequential as well as parallel message
   scheduling versions of FMGaBP demonstrate high convergence rates
   independent of the scale of discretization on the finest mesh. In
   comparison with the multigrid preconditioned conjugate gradient (MG-PCG)
   solver, the FMGaBP algorithm demonstrates considerable iteration
   reductions as tested by Laplace benchmark problems. In addition, the
   parallel implementation of FMGaBP shows a speedup of 2.9 times over the
   parallel implementation of MG-PCG using eight CPU cores.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of numerical integration methods for finite-element
   analysis (FEA) is investigated. The focus of this paper, within the
   context of traditional FEA, is the postprocessing operation of numerical
   integration over a subdomain containing potentially large numbers of

   increase the efficacy of the assembly process for the mass and stiffness
   matrices of a generalized family of macroelements. The analogous
   postprocessing and matrix assembly methods are refined such that
   repeated computations are eliminated, effectively treating a large
   number of traditionally separate numerical integrations as one
   full-domain integral. Electromagnetic applications are tested to
   demonstrate the reduction in computational cost of the method. Results
   demonstrate increased efficiency as higher order basis functions and
   larger numbers of elements are employed.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, the dual phase lag heat conduction in functionally
   graded hollow spheres is investigated under spherically symmetric and
   axisymmetric thermal loading. The heat conduction equation is given
   based on the dual phase lag theory to consider the details of energy
   transport in the material in comparison with the non-Fourier hyperbolic
   heat conduction. All the material properties of the sphere are taken to
   vary continuously along the radial direction following a power-law with
   arbitrary non-homogeneity indices except the phase lags which are
   assumed to be constant for simplicity. The specified spherically
   symmetric and axisymmetric boundary conditions of the sphere lead to a
   1D and 2D heat conduction problem, respectively. Employing the Laplace
   transform to eliminate the time dependency of the problem, analytical
   solutions are obtained for the temperature and heat flux. The final
   results in the time domain are obtained by a numerical Laplace inversion
   method. The speed of thermal wave in the functionally graded sphere
   based on the dual phase lag is compared with that of the hyperbolic heat
   conduction. Furthermore, the numerical results are shown to clarify the
   effects of phase lags and non-homogeneity indices on the thermal
   response. The current results are verified with those reported in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{The specific results of the work investigating the effect of gas density
   and water temperature on bubble size were present. These were surrogate
   variables designed to investigate the effect of viscosity (varying water
   temperature) and altitude (varying gas density). The results show that
   there is a measurable but relatively small effect of gas density on
   bubble size. The D (32) is revealed to increase proportionally as (rho
   (0)/rho (g))(0.132). The projected impact on flotation kinetics at 4500
   m versus sea level is small, of the order of 0.5\% recovery loss for a
   bank of eight flotation cells. The effect of water temperature (4-40 A
   degrees C) on bubble size is more significant than gas density. The
   relationship correlates with water viscosity values quite closely. A
   finding that D (32) increases proportionally as (A mu/A mu(20))(0.776)
   highlights the importance of accounting for viscosity effects if, for

Abstract = {{Low density, non-toxicity, biodegradability and mechanical properties
   similar to human tissues such as bone make magnesium (Mg) alloys
   attractive for biomedical applications ranging from bone to
   cardiovascular implants. The most important challenge that still
   prevents the widespread use of Mg implants is their rapid degradation
   rate. In this study we investigate the combined effect of calcium (Ca)
   and strontium (Sr) on the corrosion behavior of Mg via in vitro
   immersion and electrochemical tests in simulated body fluid (SBF), and
   analyze changes in mechanical properties. We show that the combined
   addition of 0.3 wt.\% Sr and 0.4 wt.\% Ca decreases the corrosion rate
   of Mg both in terms of mass loss and hydrogen evolution more effectively
   than the single addition of either alloying element. We investigate the
   microstructure of as-cast specimens and the morphology of the corrosion
   products using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   electron probe micro-analysis, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. Tensile and three point bending tests reveal
   that the ternary alloy Mg-0.3Sr-0.3Ca has a good combination of
   mechanical properties and corrosion resistance with hydrogen evolution
   rates of 0.01 mL/cm(2)/h in SBF. Higher concentrations of Sr and Ca
   alter the resulting microstructure leading to increased corrosion rates
   in SBF by promoting the micro-galvanic corrosion between the alpha-Mg
   matrix and intermetallic phases of Mg17Sr2 and Mg2Ca along the grain
   boundaries. These results indicate that the combined addition of optimal
   amounts of Ca and Sr is a promising approach to decrease the high
   degradation rate of Mg implants in physiological conditions, as well as
   attaining high ductility in the alloy. The better properties of the
   Mg-0.35r-0.3Ca alloy are related to the new intermetallic phases found
   in this sample. The optimum composition is attributed to the ``third
   element effect{''}, as seen in the corrosion behavior of metallic
   alloys. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we examined the in-vivo characteristics of a novel
   microencapsulated thalidomide formulation in a murine model of
   experimental Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease was induced with a single
   intra-colonic injection of 120 mg/kg of bodyweight of
   2,5,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 30\% ethanol in
   Balb/c mice. Level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha),
   interleukin one beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and nitric oxide
   (NO) were measured in tissue homogenate. Moreover, myeloperoxidase (MPO)
   activity was determined to assess the extent of neutrophil infiltration.
   Dose response study showed that treating the mice with microencapsulated
   thalidomide (100 mg/kg of bodyweight) for two weeks significantly
   decreased the degree of intestinal inflammation related to Crohn's
   disease. Higher and lower doses (0, 25, 50 and 200 mg/kg of bodyweight)
   did not exhibit comparable effects. The present study validates the
   success of alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules
   containing thalidomide in reducing colonic inflammation, and proposes a
   potential remedy for Crohn's disease.}},

Title = {{Nanoscale viscoelasticity of extracellular matrix proteins in soft

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{196-204}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{It is hypothesized that the bulk viscoelasticity of soft tissues is
   determined by two length-scale-dependent mechanisms: the time-dependent
   response of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins at the nanometer
   scale and the biophysical interactions between the ECM solid structure
   and interstitial fluid at the micrometer scale. The latter is governed
   by poroelasticity theory assuming free motion of the interstitial fluid
   within the porous ECM structure. In a recent study (Hens, H.K., Miri,
   A.K., Tripathy, U., Barthelat, F., Mongeau, L., 2013. J. Mech. Behav.
   Biomed. Mater.), atomic force microscopy was used to measure the
   response of porcine vocal folds to a creep loading and a 50-nm
   sinusoidal oscillation. A constitutive model was calibrated and verified
   using a finite element model to accurately predict the nanoscale
   viscoelastic moduli of ECM. A generally good correlation was obtained
   between the predicted variation of the viscoelastic moduli with depth
   and that. of hyaluronic acids in vocal fold tissue. We conclude that
   hyaluronic acids may regulate vocal fold viscoelasticity. The proposed
   methodology offers a characterization tool for biomaterials used in
   vocal fold augmentations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present energy-efficient architectures for decoders of
   low-density parity check (LDPC) codes using the differential decoding
   with binary message passing (DD-BMP) algorithm and its modified variant
   (MDD-BMP). We also propose an improved differential binary (IDB)
   decoding algorithm. These algorithms offer significant intrinsic
   advantages in the energy domain: simple computations, low interconnect
   complexity, and very high throughput, while achieving error correction
   performance up to within 0.25 dB of the offset min-sum algorithm. We
   report on fully parallel decoder implementations of (273, 191), (1023,
   781), and (4095, 3367) finite geometry-based LDPC codes in 65 nm CMOS.
   Using the MDD-BMP algorithm, these decoders achieve respective areas of
   0.28 mm(2), 1.38 mm(2), and 15.37 mm(2), average throughputs of 37 Gbps,
   75 Gbps, and 141 Gbps, and energy efficiencies of 4.9 pJ/bit, 13.2
   pJ/bit, and 37.9 pJ/bit with a 1.0 V supply voltage in post-layout
   simulations. At a reduced supply voltage of 0.8 V, these decoders
   achieve respective throughputs of 26 Gbps, 54 Gbps, and 94 Gbps, and
   energy efficiencies of 3.1 pJ/bit, 8.2 pJ/bit, and 23.5 pJ/bit. We also
   report on a fully parallel implementation of IDB for the (2048, 1723)
   LDPC code specified in the IEEE 802.3an (10GBASE-T) standard. This
   decoder achieves an area of 1.44 mm(2), average throughput of 172 Gbps,

Abstract = {{In this work, we use an inorganic titanium precursor (titanium
   oxysulfate, TiOSO4) for the preparation of doped TiO2 by the sol-gel
   method. Molybdenum (Mo), iron (Fe) and vanadium (V) in the concentration
   range of 0.0312-2.0 mol\% are added as dopants. The prepared samples
   were characterized by XRD, FTIR, N-2 isotherms, SEM-EDX, TEM, UV-Vis DRS
   and PL techniques. X-ray diffraction revealed that an increase in the
   concentration of Mo causes the transformation of brookite into anatase
   phase. In contrast, Fe and V favor the formation of brookite phase. A
   decrease in crystallite size was observed on the addition of dopant ions
   compared to that of pure TiO2 (7 nm), for 0.0312 mol\% concentration of
   dopant in TiO2, a crystallite size of 6.3 nm (Mo), 6.2 nm (Fe) and 6.4
   nm (V) was calculated. A noticeable change in anatase lattice parameter
   along the ``c{''} direction was observed with increasing dopant
   concentration, this is evidence that the dopant ions have entered the
   TiO2 crystal lattice by substitutional doping, which induces local
   distortion of the crystal structure and variation in interatomic
   distances. An increase in BET surface area and a decrease in pore size
   were observed with increasing dopant concentration, this may be due to
   their substitutional doping in crystal lattice and or their presence in
   the grain boundaries hindering the crystal growth. Diffuse reflectance
   studies indicate that doped TiO2 showed visible light absorption
   compared to that of pure TiO2 (3.1 eV). For 0.25 mol\% concentration of
   dopant in TiO2, energy values of 2.6 eV (Mo), 2.95 eV (Fe) and 2.92 eV
   (V) were obtained. PL analysis clearly shows that the dopant ions have
   the capability to alter the oxygen vacancies and to produce Ti+3 surface
   species which trap the photogenerated electron and transfer the electron
   to surface absorbed oxygen and results in the decrease of electron hole
   pair recombination rate. Visible light photoactivity tests for the
   discoloration of methylene blue demonstrated that the doped samples
   showed enhanced photoactivity compared to undoped TiO2 and commercially
   available Degussa P25, because of composite nature, surface hydroxyl
   groups, narrowed band gap and decreased recombination rate of
   photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The highest photocatalytic activity
   was observed with 0.25 mol\% dopant concentration, the calculated
   reaction rate constant (k(obs)) was 0.97 min(-1) (Mo), 1.18 min(-1) (Fe)
   and 1.17 min(-1) (V) compared to 0.18 min(-1) (undoped TiO2) and 0.17
   min(-1) (Degussa P25).}},

Abstract = {{This technical note presents a continuum approach to a non-Gaussian
   initial mean consensus problem via Mean Field (MF) stochastic control
   theory. In this problem formulation: (i) each agent has simple
   stochastic dynamics with inputs directly controlling its state's rate of
   change and (ii) each agent seeks to minimize by continuous state
   feedback its individual discounted cost function involving the mean of
   the states of all other agents. For this dynamic game problem, a set of
   coupled deterministic (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and
   Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov) equations is derived approximating the
   stochastic system of agents as the population size goes to infinity. In
   a finite population system(analogous to the MF LQG framework): (i) the
   resulting decentralized MF control strategies possess an epsilon(N)-Nash
   equilibrium property where goes epsilon(N) to zero as the population
   size N approaches infinity and (ii) these MF control strategies steer
   each individual's state toward the initial state population mean which
   is reached asymptotically as time goes to infinity. Hence, the system
   with decentralized MF control strategies reaches mean-consensus on the
   initial state population mean asymptotically as time goes to infinity.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAluminum (III) hydroxy-gels find important applications in
   areas such as paint pigments, pharmaceuticals and water treatment or
   toxic metal sequestration. Since the method of preparation may affect
   their properties and performance, in this work we prepare aluminum
   hydroxy-gels from either chloride or sulphate salts and subject them to
   comparative characterization.
   ResultsAluminum (III) hydroxy-gels were produced by partial quick
   neutralization of 2molL(-1) AlCl3 or Al(SO4)(1.5) salt solutions with 5N
   NaOH at room temperature. The gels were found, following ageing and
   water washing, to consist of 60-70wt\% Al(OH)(3), 5-18wt\% Cl or SO4 and
   approximate to 20wt\% water. Both gel materials upon drying were seen to
   be highly porous formed from aggregates of very fine particles nucleated
   during the fast neutralization process. The Al(SO4)(1.5)-derived gel was
   found to differ significantly from the AlCl3-derived gel both in terms
   of surface area (38m(2)g(-1) vs. 18m(2)g(-1)) and chemical features. The
   aluminum chloride gel material is probably composed of chains of
   aluminum octahedra (Al-n(OH)(2.5)Cl-0.5n(H2O)(3n)) while the aluminum
   sulphate gel of SO4-stabilized Keggin Al-13 structure:
   AlO4Al12(OH)(24)(SO4)(3.5)(H2O)(12).
   ConclusionThe distinct molecular structure of the aluminum
   sulphate-derived gel may provide an effective matrix for hazardous metal
   containment. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Title = {{Analytical Design Model for Reinforced-Concrete Beams Strengthened in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an analytical study on reinforced
   concrete (RC) T-beams strengthened in shear with L-shaped
   fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) plates. The main objective of this study
   is to develop design equations for RC beams retrofitted in shear using
   L-shaped FRP plates, considering all possible modes of failure in
   ultimate limit states. Unlike RC beams strengthened with externally
   bonded (EB) FRP plates and fabrics, prefabricated L-shaped plates
   feature unconventional failure modes because of their special shape and
   anchorage. The possible failure modes for RC beams strengthened with
   L-shaped FRP plates are (1) concrete breakout at the embedded part of
   the FRP plate in the flange; (2) FRP pull-off at the epoxy/FRP
   interface; (3) FRP pull-off at the concrete/epoxy interface; and (4) FRP
   overlap failure at the beam soffit. These failure modes do not occur in
   RC beams shear-strengthened with EB FRP fabrics and plates. Therefore,
   the existing design models for EB FRP fabrics and plates cannot predict
   with sufficient accuracy the contribution of FRP to the shear resistance
   of RC beams shear-strengthened with L-shaped plates. In this article,
   new design equations are proposed in light of recent developments and
   data. These equations distinguish the failure mode and calculate the FRP
   contribution to the shear resistance of RC beams strengthened with
   L-shaped FRP plates. In some cases, full embedment of the L-shaped
   carbon FRP (CFRP) plates in the RC beam flange is not feasible because
   of the presence of an obstacle (e. g., longitudinal reinforcing steel
   bars in the flange). The new design equations are applicable to RC beams
   strengthened with L-shaped FRP plates with different embedment lengths
   (including no embedment) of the CFRP plates in the RC beam flange. The
   proposed design equations are validated against experimental data
   collected from the literature. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil

Pages = {{701-703}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate an integrated tunable optical delay line in
   grating-assisted contradirectional couplers using a CMOS-compatible
   photonic technology. The input signal is delayed through dispersive
   Bragg gratings and distributedly coupled to the drop port of the coupler
   without backreflections. This add-drop design enables monolithic
   integration of grating-based delay lines without using optical
   circulators. The gratings are formed by slab perturbations in rib
   waveguides, with the index chirping realized by linearly tapering the
   rib widths. Both the pitch and size of the gratings are constant through
   the entire coupler, for a higher tolerance to fabrication errors.
   Continuous tuning of the optical group delay of up to 96 ps has been
   obtained, with a low insertion loss of less than 2 dB and a negative
   chromatic dispersion of -11 ps/nm that allows for bit rates of up to
   almost 100 Gb/s at the maximal delay. The device has a small footprint
   of 0.015 mm(2), and can be used for on-chip optical buffering,
   dispersion compensation, and pulse compression. (C) 2014 Optical Society

Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The biosand filter is a household-scale point-of-use water filtration
   system based on slow sand filtration, but modified for intermittent
   operation. Studies on slow sand filters show that intermittent operation
   reduces filter effectiveness. However, continuous versus intermittent
   operation of biosand filters has never been compared. Eight 10-cm
   diameter columns were constructed to represent field biosand filters.
   Five were operated intermittently with a 24-h residence period, while
   the remaining three were operated continuously. Continuous operation of
   the filters resulted in significantly better reduction of Escherichia
   coli (3.71 logio versus 1.67 logio), bacteriophage MS2 (2.25 logio
   versus 0.85 logio), and turbidity (96\% versus 87\%). Dissolved oxygen
   levels at 5 and 10 cm of media depth in intermittent filters reached an
   average of 0 mg/L by 24 h of residence time on day 60 of the experiment.
   A simple numerical model was developed to describe E. coli removal
   during ripening from days 0-58 for continuously operated versus
   intermittent filters. This research confirms that although biosand
   filters were developed for intermittent operation, the filters perform
   significantly better when operated continuously. However, both
   operational modes resulted in a significant reduction of microbial
   indicators. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quantification of the impact of a confounding variable on functional
   connectivity confirms anti-correlated networks in the resting-state}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{343-353}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The effect of regressing out the global average signal (GAS) in resting
   state fMRI data has become a concern for interpreting functional
   connectivity analyses. It is not clear whether the reported
   anti-correlations between the Default Mode and the Dorsal Attention
   Networks are intrinsic to the brain, or are artificially created by
   regressing out the GAS. Here we introduce a concept, Impact of the
   Global Average on Functional Connectivity (IGAFC), for quantifying the
   sensitivity of seed-based correlation analyses to the regression of the
   GAS. This voxel-wise IGAFC index is defined as the product of two
   correlation coefficients: the correlation between the GAS and the fMRI
   time course of a voxel, times the correlation between the GAS and the
   seed time course. This definition enables the calculation of a threshold
   at which the impact of regressing-out the GAS would be large enough to
   introduce spurious negative correlations. It also yields a post-hoc
   impact correction procedure via thresholding, which eliminates spurious
   correlations introduced by regressing out the GAS. In addition, we
   introduce an Artificial Negative Correlation Index (ANCI), defined as
   the absolute difference between the IGAFC index and the impact
   threshold. The ANCI allows a graded confidence scale for ranking voxels
   according to their likelihood of showing artificial correlations. By
   applying this method, we observed regions in the Default Mode and Dorsal
   Attention Networks that were anti-correlated. These findings confirm
   that the previously reported negative correlations between the Dorsal
   Attention and Default Mode Networks are intrinsic to the brain and not
   the result of statistical manipulations. Our proposed quantification of
   the impact that a confound may have on functional connectivity can be
   generalized to global effect estimators other than the GAS. It can be
   readily applied to other confounds, such as systemic physiological or
   head movement interferences, in order to quantify their impact on
   functional connectivity in the resting state. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Nonlinear forced vibrations of water-filled, laminated circular
   cylindrical shells are studied by using the Amabili-Reddy nonlinear
   higher-order shear deformation theory and energy approach in the
   Lagrangian description. The fluid is modeled by potential flow. It is
   assumed that the shell is subjected to a steady harmonic concentrated
   force acting in the radial direction. Pseudo arc-length continuation and
   collocation technique is used to carry out bifurcation analysis and to
   obtain nonlinear frequency-amplitude responses. Direct time integration
   of the equations of motion has also been performed by using Gear's
   backward differentiation formula (BDF) to obtain time histories, phase
   space diagrams and Poincare maps. The effect of internal fluid and
   lamination angle on the frequency-amplitude response in the neighborhood
   of the resonance frequency, traveling wave solution and internal
   resonances of simply supported shells are investigated. It is shown that
   water-filled composite shells may exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics
   including a rare and intricate 1:1:1:1 internal resonance. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, an analytical solution is obtained for the magnetoelastic
   response of a multilayered and functionally graded cylinder with an

   conditions are assumed for the axisymmetric cylinder. The composite
   cylinder is placed in a constant magnetic field parallel to its axis.
   The magnetoelastic governing equations are solved exactly and the
   displacement and stress components are obtained in terms of Bessel,
   Struve, and Lommel functions. Using the analytical solution for the
   multilayered, composite cylinder, the magnetoelastic response of a
   functionally graded cylinder with exponential and power law distribution
   of material properties is investigated. Finally, the numerical results

Abstract = {{The effects of square waveform (intermittent) and sinusoidal waveform
   pulsation are investigated on the heat transfer rate from a slot jet
   impinging to a concave surface. In this respect, a numerical analysis of
   turbulent flow and heat transfer in a two-dimensional jet is performed
   using the RNG k-epsilon model. The effects of jet Reynolds number,
   pulsation frequency, nozzle to target surface spacing in both types of
   waves and the effect of the amplitude of sinusoidal waves on
   distribution of the surface time-averaged local Nusselt number are
   studied. Results show that in the pulsed jets, the increase of frequency
   in the range of 20-80 Hz and the Reynolds number in the range of
   4740-7200 cause the increase of the time-averaged Nusselt number
   compared to steady jet cases. In the pulsed jets, reducing the
   nozzle-to-surface distance causes the increase of heat transfer from the
   target surface. Moreover, the increase of pulse amplitude from 0.2 to
   1.0 in the sinusoidal waves increases the time-averaged Nusselt number.
   Finally, the comparison of results indicates a considerable increase of
   the heat transfer rate for the square form waves than sinusoidal waves

Abstract = {{Transport and other measurements have been made on CuInSe2+x samples
   obtained from Bridgman ingots grown from melts containing controlled
   amounts of elemental sodium, where x represents the excess of Se over
   stoichiometry. Thermoelectric power and Hall coefficient at room

   change the conductivity type, denoted by {[}Na](crit), increases with x,
   almost linearly, with an initial slope of 2, corresponding to an
   approximate formula of {[}Na](crit)=2x+delta, where delta is found to be
   025 at\% Na. This behavior can be accounted for quantitatively using a
   `selenium starvation' model, whereby at the p-to-n type change, two
   atoms of sodium have reacted with one atom of Se to form a molecule like
   Na2Se, with an atom-to-atom ratio {[}Na]/{[}Se]=2. Such molecules were

Title = {{A new approach for regional scale interrill and rill erosion intensity
   mapping using brightness index assessments from medium resolution
   satellite images}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{306-313}},

Abstract = {{Having accurate soil erosion intensity/type maps using satellite imagery
   is not generally a difficult task. However, there are still difficulties
   for the generation of small scale erosion features at regional and
   national levels. It is even more problematic when high-resolution
   satellite images cannot be used due to their high cost at a regional
   level. The principal objective of this study is to investigate the
   applicability of brightness value to generate accurate interrill and
   till erosion intensity maps using medium resolution satellite images at
   a regional level. In this study, Landsat ETM+ images are used and the
   Golestan dam watershed with an area of 4511.8 km(2) located at northeast
   of Iran is selected as the study area. In order to generate a
   Homogeneous Land Unit (HLU) map, three ancillary layers including slope,
   landform, land use and land cover, are overlayed on each other. The HLUs
   are used in a supportive role for identifying appropriate sampling
   points across the entire study area, at which the degrees of interrill
   and rill erosions are measured. The ground-truth erosion information
   collected at the 1328 locations is divided into training and reference
   data sets. Using the Tasseled Cap transformation technique, the
   brightness value of each pixel at the beginning (May), middle (July) and
   end (September) of growing season is obtained. By subtracting the May
   brightness value (B-M) from the July one (B-J), and the July brightness
   value from the September one (B-s), two new brightness images
   representing the brightness variations over May-July (B-MJ) and
   July-September (B-JS) are created. The two new brightness images are
   combined to generate a map where its pixels indicate the state (i.e.
   increase, I, decrease, D, and constant, C) of brightness variation over
   the two growing seasons. Using the measured interrill and rill erosion
   information at the training sampling locations, a unique relationship is
   found between the trend of brightness variation and the erosion
   intensity. This relationship is validated using the reference data sets.
   The results show that the proposed method is able to produce an
   interrill-rill erosion intensity map with an overall field-checked
   accuracy of 96\% at this study location. The main advantages of this
   method are its high accuracy, its lower demands on time and funds for
   field work, and the ready availability of required data. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The recrystallization and texture evolution of four Mg-Zn-Ce sheets with
   a warm-rolled microstructure obtained through two stages that can be
   characterised as rough rolling and finish rolling were investigated at
   different stages of post-rolling annealing. On annealing, the same
   regions of the microstructure, located by hardness indentations, were
   examined and tracked by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD).
   Furthermore, intragranular misorientation axes (IGMA) analysis was used
   to investigate the associated deformation mechanisms in the as-deformed
   material. By combining these two methods, the development of the
   recrystallization microstructure was investigated and important aspects,
   such as preferential nucleation sites, correlation between activated
   deformation mechanism and initial orientation of the recrystallized
   grains, were studied. The results showed that the Mg-1Zn-1Ce alloy,
   which had the highest Ce/Zn ratio, showed the weakest as-rolled texture
   and the most homogenous distribution of shear banding/twinning. The IGMA
   analysis also showed that in Mg-1Zn-1Ce, other types of dislocations
   rather than basal aOE (c) a > were activated; in particular, prismatic
   aOE (c) a > type was activated during deformation. Therefore, the
   weakening of recrystallization texture during rolling resulting from the
   addition of RE elements was linked with a change in dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX) behaviour. Since the Mg-1Zn-1Ce alloy
   corresponds to the highest level of Ce in solid solution, the observed
   texture weakening was possibly due to decreasing grain boundary mobility
   as a result of solute partitioning of RE elements to dislocations and
   grain boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{In the first part of this two-part paper, the effect of increasing Ce in
   solid solution on the recrystallization and texture evolution of four
   Mg-Zn-Ce sheets was investigated in the as-deformed and annealed state.
   In this second part, the effect of rolling speed on the microstructure
   and texture development of these alloys is evaluated. The effect of
   rolling speed on the recrystallization and texture evolution of four
   Mg-Zn-Ce sheets was investigated at as-deformed and different stages of
   annealing. The deformation microstructure was obtained through two
   stages that can be characterised as rough rolling and finish rolling. To
   study the effect of finish rolling temperature, one rolling pass with a
   65 \% reduction in thickness was performed at 300 and 450 A degrees C
   and at rolling speeds of 15 and 1000 m/min. The results showed that by
   increasing the rolling speed, more secondary and compression twins were
   activated, which leads to the formation of more numerous local shear
   bands and a more uniform microstructure. Annealing secondary twins
   (S-twins) and their vicinity were observed to be the preferential sites
   for nucleation, and it seems that recrystallization on S-twins
   contributes to basal texture weakening. Therefore, an increasing number
   of such twins increase the texture weakening. In this way, the
   combination of these RE additions and HSR resulted in a weaker deformed
   and annealed texture.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{122-130}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies one- and two-step homogenization models for
   predicting the stiffness of Polymer-Clay Nanocomposites (PCN) with
   aligned particles. In particular, the influence of the Effective
   Particle (EP) concept central to two-step models is assessed for
   numerical as well as analytical modeling. This study covers intercalated
   PCN, as well as exfoliated morphologies in the presence of interphase.
   The predictions of analytical and simplified numerical homogenization
   models were compared against detailed 3D Finite Element (FE) simulations
   where the PCN layered microstructure is explicitly simulated. The
   Representative Volume Element (RVE) was rigorously determined. The
   theoretical predictions were also compared against experimental data
   extracted from the literature. It was found that both numerical and
   analytical two-step methods may significantly diverge from the FE
   simulations of the detailed microstructures. In general, the analytical
   multi-coated inclusions model delivers more reliable results than
   two-step methods. Despite their higher computational costs, one-step FE
   models are necessary, depending on the PCN microstructure and the
   desired accuracy. It was also found that the more the EP is different
   from the nanoclay, in terms of rigidity and aspect ratio, or the higher
   the volume fraction is, the more the accuracy of two-step numerical
   models is deteriorated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Analysis of Protein and Gene Expression in Salivary Glands
   of Sjogren's-Like Disease NOD Mice Treated by Bone Marrow Soup}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Background: Bone marrow cell extract (termed as BM Soup) has been
   demonstrated to repair irradiated salivary glands (SGs) and restore
   saliva secretion in our previous study. In the present study, we aim to
   investigate if the function of damaged SGs in non-obese diabetic (NOD)
   mice can be restored by BM Soup treatment and the molecular alterations
   associated with the treatment.
   Methods: Whole BM cells were lysed and soluble intracellular contents
   ({''}BM Soup{''}) were injected I. V. into NOD mice. Tandem mass tagging
   with 2-D liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to quantify
   proteins in the submandibular glands (SMGs) between untreated and BM
   Soup-treated mice. Quantitative PCR was used to identify genes with
   altered expression in the treated mice.
   Results BM Soup: restored salivary flow rates to normal levels and
   significantly reduced the focus scores of SMGs in NOD mice. More than
   1800 proteins in SMG cells were quantified by the proteomic approach.
   Many SMG proteins involved in inflammation and apoptosis were found to
   be down-regulated whereas those involved in salivary gland biology and
   development/regeneration were up-regulated in the BM Soup-treated mice.
   qPCR analysis also revealed expression changes of growth factors and
   cytokines in the SMGs of the treated NOD mice.
   Conclusion: BM Soup treatment is effective to restore the function of
   damaged SGs in NOD mice. Through gene/protein expression analysis, we
   have found that BM Soup treatment might effectuate via inhibiting
   apoptosis, focal adhesion and inflammation whereas promoting
   development, regeneration and differentiation of the SG cells in NOD
   mice. These findings provide important insights on the potential
   mechanisms underlying the BM Soup treatment for functional restoration
   of damaged SGs in NOD mice. Additional studies are needed to further
   confirm the identified target genes and their related signaling pathways
   that are responsible for the BM Soup treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidation behavior of two-phase Mg-Nd alloys was investigated via

   phase, Mg oxidation from the intermetallic and the alpha-Mg phases, and
   then Nd oxidation from alpha-Mg. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed a mixed MgO-Nd2O3 scale
   formation on the surfaces with a Nd2O3 rich subscale. Dual oxide
   morphology evolved during the oxidation process that mimics the
   two-phase microstructure of the alloys. This heterogeneous scale
   formation on the surface was attributed to the differing oxidation
   behavior of the two phases (alpha-Mg and Mg12Nd) in the alloys. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Long-term drought forecasts can provide valuable information to help
   mitigate some of the consequences of drought. Data driven models are
   suitable forecast tools due to their minimal information requirements
   and rapid development times. This study compares the effectiveness of
   five data driven models for forecasting long-term (6 and 12 months lead
   time) drought conditions in the Awash River Basin of Ethiopia. The
   Standard Precipitation Index (SPI 12 and SPI 24) was forecasted using a
   traditional stochastic model (ARIMA) and compared to machine learning
   techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector
   regression (SVR). In addition to these three model types, wavelet
   transforms were used to pre-process the inputs for ANN and SVR models to
   form WA-ANN and WA-SVR models; this is the first time that WA-SVR models
   have been explored and tested for long-term SPI forecasting. The

Abstract = {{In this article, using finite element method of analysis (FEM), behavior
   of the endplate moment connection subjected to axial force and bending
   moment is investigated. In the FEM model, all the nonlinear
   characteristics such as material, geometry, as well as contact have been
   included. First, in order to verify the numerical model of the
   connection, an analysis of the endplate moment connection conducted
   without the application of the axial force. Results obtained from FEM
   indicating a close and good correlation with the experimental results.
   Then to investigate the influence of the axial forces, the connections
   subjected to axial forces as well as the bending moment are analyzed. To
   observe the overall effect of these actions, the moment-axial force
   interaction diagrams are drawn. It is observed that the presence of
   axial force even in a small value can change the behavior of the
   connection significantly. It is also shown that the axial forces can
   alter the failure mode of the connection; and therefore it could result
   in a different than the predicted moment capacity of the connection.}},

Abstract = {{A computational framework is developed for applying interfacial kinetic
   transport theory to predict water vapour permeability of porous media.
   Modified conservation equations furnish spatially periodic disturbances
   from which the average flux and, thus, the effective diffusivity is
   obtained. The equations are solved exactly for a model porous medium
   comprising parallel layers of gas and solid with arbitrary solid volume
   fraction. From the microscale effective diffusivity, a two-point
   boundary-value problem is solved at the macroscale to furnish the water
   vapour transport rate in membranes subjected to a finite RH
   differential. Then, the microscale model is implemented using a
   computational framework (extended finite-element method) to examine the
   role of particle size, aspect ratio and positioning for periodic arrays
   of aligned super-ellipses (model particles that pack with high density).
   We show that the transverse water vapour permeability can be reduced by
   an order of magnitude only when fibres with a high-aspect ratio cross
   section are packed in a periodic staggered configuration. Maximum
   permeability is achieved at intermediate micro-structural length scales,
   where gas-phase diffusion is enhanced by surface diffusion, but not
   limited by interfacial-exchange kinetics. The two-dimensional
   computations demonstrated here are intended to motivate further efforts
   to develop efficient computational solutions for realistic
   three-dimensional microstructures.}},

Abstract = {{The Nadai and Fields and Backofen expressions are widely used to convert
   the torque/twist data obtained during torsion testing into shear
   stress/shear strain curves as well as von Mises equivalent stress/
   equivalent strain curves. However, when employed in the conventional
   manner using average values of the twist hardening exponent N, they
   overestimate the critical strains for the initiation of twinning,
   dynamic transformation and dynamic recrystallization by comparison with
   the values determined using compression testing. By contrast, when the
   local or instantaneous values of the exponent are employed, the torsion
   and compression results are in good agreement. Another feature of the
   corrected curves is that they indicate that considerably more dynamic
   softening takes place during the high temperature deformation of
   austenite than suggested by the average N flow curves. It is shown that,
   despite the lack of work conjugacy between the torque-twist and
   stress-strain curves, the above expressions always lead to the correct
   constitutive behavior at the external radius. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Recent observations regarding the dynamic transformation of deformed
   austenite at temperatures above the Ae(3) are reviewed for four
   different steels of increasing carbon contents. The structures observed
   are Widmanstatten in nature and appear to have formed displacively. The
   effect of deformation on the Gibbs energy of austenite in these steels
   is estimated by assuming that the austenite continues to work harden
   after initiation of the transformation and that its flow stress and
   dislocation density can be derived from the experimental flow curve. By
   further taking into account the inhomogeneity of the dislocation
   density, Gibbs energy contributions are derived that are sufficient to
   promote transformation as much as 100 C above the Ae(3). The present
   calculations indicate that the dislocation densities in the regions that
   experience transformation are 2-15 times higher than the average values.
   It is also suggested that, at the lower carbon levels, plate growth is
   followed by C diffusion, while it is accompanied by C diffusion at the
   higher carbon contents. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   with a broader audience. Quantitative and qualitative data on
   hydrologists' perceptions of scale were collected using voluntary
   written surveys and face-to-face interviews. The results suggest that
   most hydrologists do not consistently define scale terms in the
   literature, and that this is a minor impediment when interacting with
   other disciplines and stakeholders. Yet, surface water and groundwater
   hydrologists agree, within one to two orders of magnitude, on the length
   scale for most scale terms. Most respondents suggest that the
   hydrological community needs to better define the length scale of scale
   terms. In the short term, hydrologists could more frequently and
   consistently clarify their own length scales whenever a scale term is
   used. A common and consistent language of scale for hydrological
   researchers could better enable communication, research, teaching and
   outreach.

Abstract = {{Conventional drilling of modern super alloys and composite material
   induces high stresses in the vicinity of drilled holes along with high
   thrust forces which lead to problems in terms of hole quality and
   accuracy as well as increased tool wear. A recent and promising
   technique to overcome these challenges is to introduce vibration
   assistance in the cutting zone by superimposing oscillating vibration in
   the feed direction of the tool. Two regimes of vibration excitation
   could be applied for this purpose: low frequency (<500 Hz) high
   amplitude (>100 mu m) and high frequency (>500 Hz) low amplitude (<20 mu
   m). Motivated by the advantages of the HF-VAD and the limited work
   available in the literature for this regime, a new system is developed
   by the authors where the rotating tool is excited to high frequency and
   low amplitude. The new design is based on the use of piezoelectric
   actuators to generate the motion and a high speed slip ring to ensure
   the transfer of sufficient power to the actuator. A novel concept was
   implemented by de-coupling the rotary motion of the spindle from the
   vibrational motion of the actuator to ensure a higher efficiency of
   power transmission without damaging either the actuator or the spindle.
   With this design, a retrofittable HSK 100A toolholder with high
   frequency excitation spindle attachment was manufactured to incorporate
   drill sizes up to 1/4 inches. Commissioning tests were performed under
   no load and spring loaded conditions and it was found that the system
   has a capability to excite the tool up to 100 mu m at 900 Hz (resonance
   frequency) and up to 5 mu m between 500-800 Hz and 1100-2500 Hz. HF-VAD
   tests were conducted using this new attachment on Aluminum 6061 and it
   was found that the system was able to successfully obtain the prescribed
   frequency and amplitude. Up to 50\% reduction in thrust forces was
   obtained in HF-VAD in comparison to conventional drilling under same
   cutting parameters; this is associated with finer chips with break off
   serrations.}},

Abstract = {{Defects associated with drilling of fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) are
   of major economic and safety concerns for aerospace manufacturers.
   Delamination of layers and thermal damage of the matrix are the most
   critical defects associated with drilling of FRP laminates, which can be
   avoided by keeping the drilling forces and temperatures below some
   threshold levels. Vibration-assisted drilling (VAD) is an emerging
   drilling process that uses intermittent cutting to reduce the drilling
   forces and temperatures, and achieve easier chip removal compared to
   conventional drilling. In this paper an extensive experimental study has
   been conducted to provide insight into the effect of the tool kinematics
   corresponding to the VAD parameters (speed, feed, frequency and
   amplitude) on the geometry of the formed chip determined by the
   intersection of the trajectories of the cutting edges as well as on the
   drilling forces and temperature. The combinations of the VAD parameters
   used in this study were selected from ranges of speeds 6,000 rpm to
   12,000 rpm, feeds 0.05 mm/rev to 0.15 mm/rev, frequencies 30 Hz and 60
   Hz, and amplitudes 40 mu m to 400 mu m. The Amplitude and feed were
   found to have the most dominant effect on the VAD forces, while the feed
   and speed had the dominant effect on the VAD temperatures. The thermal
   performance of the VAD process was found to be enhanced by the formation
   of vortices in the air gap created by the separation between the tool
   and the machined surface, which is mainly controlled by the feed and the
   rotational speed of the tool.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the constrained control problem of the friction
   regimes in sliding lubricated surfaces with the purpose of speed
   synchronization, wear reduction and increasing the lifetime of the
   friction lining material. The case study here is the engagement process
   of the synchronizer cone clutch system. Such synchronizer performs the
   clutchless gear shifting in a 2-speed automated manual transmission
   (AMT) of an electric vehicle. In the present study, the frictional
   behavior of the cone clutch system is investigated by considering the
   involved lubricated friction regimes. By knowing the lubricated sliding
   friction regimes, the dynamic model of the system is derived according
   to the variable coefficient of friction. Moreover, the primary sources
   of the uncertainty and disturbance are recognized and considered in the
   dynamic model of the system. For the purpose of controlling the system,
   the control objectives and the constraints are defined, and a controller
   design method is proposed. The controller design method is based on
   solving a set of linear programming (LP) problems in the offline phase,
   which results in a piecewise affine (PWA) feedback law that can be
   easily applied on the system in the real-time closed-loop configuration.
   Finally, the performance of the proposed control approach is assessed by
   presenting the closed-loop control results for the ideal situation as
   well as the perturbed systems in the presence of the disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission is one of the crucial elements of the driveline that
   affects vehicle fuel economy and comfort. It can transfer power in
   different combinations of torque and speed. This paper focuses on the
   modeling, simulation and control of a two-speed transmission for
   electric vehicles which has seamless gear shifting specification. The
   transmission incorporates two-stage planetary gear sets and two braking
   mechanisms to control the gear shifting. The dynamic model is developed
   by using the kinematic equations of the planetary gear trains and the
   Euler-Lagrange equations to derive the equations of motion. The
   mathematical model is validated by using the SimDriveLine library of
   MATLAB/Simulink (R). The controller design employs optimal control
   methods to provide seamless shifting with minimum transition time. Then,
   by relaxing ideal constraints, a feasible controller is designed based
   on input-output and input-state feedback linearization. Simulation
   results demonstrate the ability of the proposed transmission to have
   smooth shifting without excessive oscillations in the output torque and

Abstract = {{In this paper, the robust force control of a solenoid actuator is
   studied. Such control problem is of interest in the study of gear
   shifting control in electric vehicles (EVs) equipped with an automated
   manual transmission (AMT). Experimental system identication together
   with the finite element method (FEM) is the approach considered in this
   paper to model the dynamic behavior of the solenoid actuator as well as
   the system uncertainties. Using experimental system identification, a
   dynamic model of the actuator is obtained and a nonlinear algebraic
   model of the electromagnetic force versus current and air gap is
   proposed. Using the properties of the magnetic materials and the
   geometry of the actuator, an FEM analysis is performed using Magnet (R)
   -Infolytica software-to obtain the dynamics of the nominal system and
   verify the system identification result. Considering the inherent
   uncertainty of the physical parameter involved in the actuation system
   as well as the measurement errors, an uncertainty analysis is performed
   to obtain the dynamic uncertainty model of the solenoid system.
   Moreover, considering the application of such actuator in the gear
   shifting process, the closed-loop performance objectives are defined
   with respect to the desired gear shifting quality. Knowing both the
   nominal system model and the uncertainty model, an H-infinity robust
   controller is designed. The performance of the resulting robust
   closed-loop control system is examined for the nominal and perturbed
   systems and is shown to satisfy the objectives.}},

Abstract = {{In metastasis process, it is hypothesized that tumor cells detach from
   the primary tumor and are released into the bloodstream and to distant
   sites, forming secondary tumors. To use these Circulating Tumor Cells
   (CTC) as a cancer biomarker, significant research has been directed to
   the development of devices capable of detecting and enumerating CTCs.
   Size-based isolation approach using microfilters has been effectively
   developed to capture CTCs. However due to the lack of capability for
   live monitoring the tumor cell capturing on the filter, the optimization
   of the current filter-based devices for capturing heterogeneous CTCs is
   very challenging. We report a low-cost cartridge with a see-through site
   enabling the enumeration of tumor cells and imaging cells entrapment on
   the filter which help to characterize the parameters involved in the
   capturing process. Real time imaging along with the pressure and flow
   control assist to simply correlate the pressure on the filter, the cell
   velocity and flow rate, and the entrapment of cells from the pores.
   Based on the velocity of cells over pores, an appropriate flow rate was
   selected and the capture efficiency of breast cancer cells was then
   measured for different filter pore sizes. The device will be a
   breakthrough platform for the current filter-based detection devices
   with high potential for optimization of the isolation parameters, and to
   find out how these parameters may affect the squeezing of tumor cells
   through the pores and, as a result, the reduction of the capture
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the study of neutrophil dynamics during chemotaxis
   using the Microfluidic Quadrupole (MQ). The MQ is used to generate
   concentration gradients of the chemokine Interleukin-8 atop human
   neutrophils cultured in petri-dishes. The gradients are generated within
   the MQ in the gap between the microfluidic probe and the
   neutrophil-containing dish. We studied travelled distances and migration
   speeds of individual neutrophils using real time-lapse microscopy and
   observed heterogeneity with neutrophils dynamics. Results show that the
   migration distance of individual neutrophils is correlated to their
   initial position within the gradients. Interestingly, analysis revealed
   that neutrophils started migration with full speed at the beginning of
   the experiment when exposed to the gradients, and then slow down as they
   migrate toward higher concentrations until they stop, suggesting a
   desensitization mechanism that is gradually activated.}},

Abstract = {{An iterative algorithm is presented in the literature, to losslessly
   compress binary sources by using turbo codes. This algorithm searches
   for the smallest codeword length to guarantee zero distortion; and
   offers promising compression rates at the expense of large encoding
   delays. In this work we propose an improved encoding algorithm that
   works in two stages. At the first stage we estimate the codeword length.
   The estimated length does not guarantee zero distortion; however, we set
   a criterion to make sure that the distortion is below a definied
   threshold. At the second stage we improve our estimation to remove the
   remaining distortion and achieve lossless compression. Our simulations
   show that by careful choice of parameters: (i) our proposed algorithm
   achieves the same average compression rate as the algorithm appearing in
   the literature, and (ii) the delay introduced by our proposed algorithm,
   which is the sum of delays introduced by first and second stages, is
   less than the delay introduced by the algorithm appearing in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a multi-port RFID tag antenna is integrated with an
   (IC)-C-2-RFID chip along with a microcontroller unit (MCU) and a sensor
   to implement a low-cost wireless temperature sensor using a commercial

   with energy-harvesting circuitry at Its second port, which can acquire
   the supply voltage needed for the operation of RFID tag sensor from the
   RF signal transmitted by the reader. In addition, a secondary method of
   energy harvesting is included by integrating thin film solar cells in
   the RFID tag profile. The measurements of the fabricated tag-based
   sensor demonstrate that a maximum sensing/reading range of 27 m is
   achieved when all the circuits are powered using solar cells. When the
   tag is operated as a simple RFID tag with no energy harvesting employed
   to power up the passive RFID chip 12.1m reading range is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The key element in haptic interfacing is the virtual contact
   representation that connects the virtual environment to the human via
   the haptic device. The properties of virtual contact can determine the
   quality of the haptic interfacing. In this work, we particularly
   investigate how the mechanical and structural properties can influence
   the virtual contact behaviour To this end, representative models are
   incorporated, where the effective parameters are directly connected to
   physical and structural properties of the system. Virtual contact
   behaviour is then investigated via parametric stability analysis, and
   corresponding spectral radius of the transition matrix is selected as a
   performance indicator It is shown that structural flexibility plays an
   important role in the quality of the haptic interfacing. As an example,
   rendering virtual walls with different impedances are considered and for
   each case the optimum effective parameters of the model is obtained for

Abstract = {{The present paper deals with interaction phenomena that may arise in the
   centrifugal compressor of helicopter engines when structural contacts
   occur between the blade-tips and the surrounding casing. Those phenomena
   may lead to increased levels of vibration and are currently under
   investigation for axial compressors of aircraft engines for which blade
   failures were observed. The growing understanding of these phenomena
   allows for more challenging numerical simulations with increased
   geometrical complexity such as centrifugal compressors. The simulation
   of blade-tip/casing contacts is carried out based on an existing
   strategy previously introduced by the authors. An ovalized casing is
   considered and two contact configurations are investigated: (1) a single
   blade impacts the casing and (2) contact may occur on any blade of the
   cyclic assembly. Based on these two contact scenarios, an in-depth
   analysis is performed through both time and space Fourier transforms.
   Results highlight the plausibility of blade/casing interaction phenomena
   similar to those observed in axial compressors since interactions are
   detected with localized vibration levels on a single impacting blade.
   When contact is treated on all the blades of the centrifugal compressor,
   the witnessed interactions feature a higher degree of complexity and
   usual criteria become insufficient to predict interaction speeds as well
   as the location of significant peaks of vibration in the frequency
   domain.}},

Abstract = {{In experimental and numerical investigations of unilateral contact and
   friction induced rotor-casing interactions, a variety of complex
   phenomena is expected. Although most of the features of the structural
   responses can be explained within a simplifying linear framework, the
   nonlinear nature of contact and friction forces induce complicated
   responses which require an appropriate methodology to be conveniently
   analyzed. The presented work focuses on a thorough numerical exploration
   of such undesired events in an attempt to provide a dedicated systematic
   method of analysis.
   Interaction simulations are carried out on the centrifugal compressor of
   a modern helicopter engine, for which it is assumed that the casing is
   rigidly distorted along a mathematical shape exhibiting distinct nodal
   diameters. The proposed work focuses on linear geometric aspects, such
   as cyclic symmetry and spatial aliasing of engine orders on nodal
   diameters as well as nonlinear attributes, such as sub- and
   super-harmonic participations in the response, in order to properly
   characterize the dynamics of the interaction.
   The results are presented as space and time two-dimensional Fourier
   transforms of the numerically predicted response. Dominant responses are

Abstract = {{We have recently proposed a new method for combined design optimization
   and calibration-based validation using a sequential approach with
   variable-size local domains of the design space and statistical
   bootstrap techniques. Our work was motivated by the fact that model
   validation in the entire design space may be neither affordable nor
   necessary. The method proceeds iteratively by obtaining test data at a
   design point, constructing around it a local domain in which the model
   is considered valid, and optimizing the design within this local domain.
   Due to test variability, it is important to know how many tests are
   needed to size each local domain of the sequential optimization process.
   Conducting an unnecessarily large number of tests may be inefficient,
   while a small number of tests may be insufficient to achieve the desired
   validity level. In this paper, we introduce a technique to determine the
   number of tests required to account for their variability by sizing the
   local domains accordingly. The goal is to achieve a desired level of
   model validation in each domain using the correlation between model data
   at the center and any other point in the local domain. The proposed
   technique is illustrated by means of a piston design example.}},

Abstract = {{The growing awareness about global climate change has boosted the need
   to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from existing power systems and
   spurred efforts to accelerate the integration of renewable energy
   sources (e.g. wind and solar power) into the electrical grid. A
   fundamental difficulty here is that renewable energy sources are usually
   of high variability. The electrical grid must absorb this variability
   through employing many additional operations (e.g., operating reserves,
   energy storage), which will largely raise the cost of electricity from
   renewable energy sources. To make it affordable, numerous advancements
   in technologies and methods for the smart grid are required. In this
   paper, we will confine ourselves to one of them: how to plan the
   construction of wind farms with high capacity and low variability
   locally and distributedly. We first study the characteristics of both
   wind resources and wind turbines and present a more accurate wind power
   evaluation method based on Gaussian Regression. Then, we analyze a
   trade-off between wind power's quantity and quality and propose an
   approach to optimally combine different types of wind turbines to
   balance the trade-off for a specific site. Finally, we explore
   geographical diversity among different sites and develop an extended
   approach that jointly optimizes the combination of sites and turbine
   types. Extensive experiments using the realistic historical wind
   resource data are conducted for either of the local and distributed
   case. Encouraging results are shown for the proposed approaches and some
   interesting insights are also provided.}},

   the development of the turbomachinery specific features of the adjoint
   solver, i.e. on the derivation of flow-consistent adjoint inlet/outlet
   boundary conditions and, to allow for a concurrent rotor/stator
   optimization and stage coupling, on the development of an exact adjoint
   counterpart to the non-reflective, conservative mixing-plane formulation
   used in the flow solver The adjoint solver is validated by comparing its
   sensitivities with finite difference gradients obtained from the flow
   solver A sequential quadratic programming algorithm is utilized to
   determine an improved blade shape based on the objective function
   gradient provided by the adjoint solution. The functionality of the
   proposed optimization method is demonstrated by the redesign of a
   single-stage transonic compressor The objective is to maximize the

Abstract = {{An emerging goal within the aviation industry is to replace conventional
   jet fuel with biologically-derived alternative fuel sources. However,
   the combustion properties of these potential fuels must be thoroughly
   characterized before they can be considered as replacements in
   turbomachinery applications. In this study, seven candidate alternative
   fuel blends, derived from two biological feedstocks and blended in
   different quantities with Jet A-1, are considered. For each blend, the
   laminar flame speed, non-premixed extinction stretch rate, and vapor
   pressure are experimentally determined and compared to numerical
   simulations and to Jet A-1 data. Hydrodynamically-stretched flame speeds
   are determined by applying particle image velocimetry (PIV) to an
   atmospheric pressure, preheated jet-wall stagnation flame, and the
   unstretched laminar flame speed is inferred using a direct comparison
   method in conjunction with a binary jet-fuel surrogate, with results
   spanning a wide equivalence ratio range. Extinction stretch rates were
   measured using particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) in a non-premixed
   counterflow diffusion flame, over a range of fuel mass fractions diluted
   in nitrogen carrier gas. Finally, the vapor pressure of the seven
   biojet/Jet A-1 fuel blends was measured using an isoteniscope over a
   wide temperature range. The results of this study indicate that moderate
   blends of hydrotreated renewable jet (HET) fuel with Jet A-1 have
   similar combustion properties to conventional jet fuel, highlighting
   their suitability as drop-in replacements, while higher blend levels of
   HRJ fuel, regardless of the crop source, lead to definitive changes in
   the combustion parameters investigated here.}},

Abstract = {{Lean premixed combustion counterflow model coupled with detailed
   chemical kinetics mechanisms are used to study the effects of methane
   dilution on syngas mixture numerically. The work critically evaluates
   and examines the effects of methane additions at various methane/syngas
   ratios and various equivalence ratios ((p = 0.6, 0.65, and 0.7) using
   the CANTERA package. The results of this study increase the feasibility
   of incorporating syngas mixture diluted with methane based fuel for lean
   premixed gas turbine engines. This study indicates that the flame
   velocity of a syngas mixture (H-2:CO-75:25) can be reduced to the flame
   speed of a methane mixture at an equivalence ratio of 0.6 and standard
   conditions (1 atm and 298 K) by mixing it with 50\% of methane. This
   could reduce the flashback propensity that syngas mixtures will incur
   due to the significantly high flame speed. Moreover, this study
   substantiates that the current detailed mechanism is capable of
   predicting the one-dimensional reacting flows and it matches remarkably
   well with experimental data. The approach employed herein can be used to
   optimize and validate detailed chemical kinetics mechanism without the
   need to correct the flame speed to zero strain or stretch free from the
   measured datasets.}},

Abstract = {{A major thrust in combustion research is the development of chemical
   kinetic models for computational analysis of various combustion
   processes. Significant deviations can be seen when comparing predictions
   of these models against experimentally determined combustion properties
   over a wide range of operating conditions and mixture strengths.
   However, these deviations vary from one model to another. It would be
   insightful in such circumstances to elucidate the species and sub
   chemistry models which lead to the varying prediction ability in various
   models. In this work we apply the Alternate Species Elimination (ASE)
   method to selected mechanisms in order to analyze their predictive
   ability with respect to propane and syngas combustion. ASE is applied to
   a homogeneous reactor undergoing ignition. The ranked species of each
   model are compared based on their Normalized Change. We further provide
   skeletal versions of the various models for propane and syngas
   combustion analysis. It is observed that this approach provides an easy
   way to determine the chemical species which are central to predictive
   performance of a model in their order of importance. It also provides a
   direct way to compare the relative importance of chemical species in the
   models under consideration. Further development and indepth analysis
   could provide more information and guidance for model improvement.}},

Abstract = {{A large eddy simulation (LES) of a turbulent swirl stabilized jet-A1
   flame is presented. The scope of the study is to incorporate a reduced
   chemistry model, as well as, coupling the turbulent flow characteristics
   to the chemical reactions and at the same time model the local chemical
   non-equilibrium due to the turbulent strain. Standard Eulerian and
   Lagrangian approaches are used to describe both gas and liquid phases,
   respectively. A joint presumed probability density function (PDF) is
   used to model turbulent-chemistry interactions in swirling jet-A1 spray
   flames. A one-component fuel, n-decane, is used as a surrogate for
   jet-Al. The combustion chemistry of the one component is represented
   through a reduced chemical kinetic mechanism (CKM) which comprises 139
   species and 1 045 reactions, derived from the detailed jet fuel
   surrogate model, JetSurf 2.0. Numerical results of the gas velocity, the
   gas temperature and the species mole fractions are compared with a set
   of published experimental data of a steady flame. In addition to the
   overall reasonable agreement obtained with the experimental data, it is
   observed that, by combining a sufficiently realistic chemistry model
   with LES to simulate a jet-Al spray flame, the prediction of major
   species is significantly improved while pollutants such as carbon
   monoxide (CO) and other species involved in slow reactions, are under
   predicted for reasons discussed in the paper.}},

   integrated within the Snecma industrial environment. This paper presents
   the first attempt to benefit from these developments and account for
   structural blade/casing contacts at the design stage of a high-pressure

   after blade/abradable coating contact occurrences on a rig test. The
   design improvements were carried out in several steps with significant
   modifications of the blade stacking law while maintaining aerodynamic
   performance of the original blade design. After a brief presentation of
   the proposed design strategy, basic concepts associated with the design
   variations are recalled. The iterated profiles are then numerically
   investigated and compared with respect to key structural criteria such
   as: (1) their mass, (2) the residual stresses stemming from centrifugal
   stiffening, (3) the vibratory level under aerodynamic forced response
   and (4) the vibratory levels when unilateral contact occurs. Significant
   improvements of the final blade design are found: the need for an early
   integration of nonlinear structural interactions criteria in the design
   stage of modern aircraft engines components is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of rotor/stator interaction phenomena between a blade-tip and
   the surrounding abradable coating deposited on the casing has seen
   recent promising numerical developments that revealed consistency with
   several experimental set-up. In particular, the location of critical
   rotational frequencies, damaged blade areas as well as the wear pattern
   along the casing circumference were accurately predicted for an
   interaction scenario involving a low-pressure compressor blade and the
   surrounding abradable coating deposited on a perfectly rigid casing. The
   structural behaviour of the blade in the vicinity of a critical
   rotational frequency however remains unclear as brutal amplitude
   variations observed experimentally could not be numerically captured
   without assuming contact loss or an improbable drastic and sudden change
   of the abradable coating mechanical properties during the interaction.
   In this paper, attention is paid to the structural behaviour of a
   high-pressure compressor blade at the neighbourhood of a critical
   rotational frequency. The interaction scenarios for two close rotational
   frequencies: Omega(c) and Omega(c){*} are analyzed using empirical mode
   decomposition based on an adjusted B-spline interpolation of the time
   responses. The obtained results are compared to the interaction scenario
   dictated by the abradable coating removal history and the location of
   contact areas. The unstable nature of the blade vibratory response when
   the rotational frequency exceeds a critical rotational frequency is
   underlined and a plausible scenario arises for explaining a sudden and
   significant decrease of the blade amplitude of vibration without contact
   separation.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the focus is made on the occurrence of precessional
   motions of the shaft whirling motions in bladed disk assemblies,
   initiated by direct blade/casing contacts in one stage of an aircraft
   engine. These contact events are favored by increasingly reduced
   blade-tip clearances and are expected to occur during standard operating
   conditions. Howeve); it has been shown that potentially harmful
   interactions may arise and threaten the engine structural integrity.
   A 2D in-plane model of an aircraft engine fan stage is built with a set
   of curved beams for the casing and an assembly straight beams for the
   bladed-disk. The flexibility of the shaft is reflected by two linear
   springs attached to the center node of the disk. Contact is initiated
   through a prescribed casing distortion and the two structures are then
   left free to interact. Equations of motion are solved via explicit
   time-marching and contact forces are computed with Lagrange multipliers
   method allowing to fully satisfy non-penetration conditions. Friction is
   accounted for through a Coulomb law and permanent sliding is assumed.
   Three types of regimes are identified, namely: (1) damped, (2)
   sustained, (3) divergent, and both forward and backward shaft
   precessional motions are witnessed. It is shown that the vibratory
   response of the bladed-disk mainly lies on the first nodal diameter of
   the first family of modes regardless of the rotational velocity or the
   type of regime detected. The risk of failure arising from these contact
   events is highlighted, in particular in the presence of forward whirl,
   and the need for accurate predictive tools in early design phases of the
   engine is emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{Associative memories, serving as building blocks for a variety of
   algorithms, store content in such a way that it can be later retrieved
   by probing the memory with a small portion of it, rather than with an
   address as in more traditional memories. Recently, Gripon and Berrou
   have introduced a novel construction which builds on ideas from the
   theory of error correcting codes, greatly outperforming the celebrated
   Hopfield Neural Networks in terms of the number of stored messages per
   neuron and the number of stored bits per synapse. The work of Gripon and
   Berrou proposes two retrieval rules, SUM-OF-SUM and SUM-OF-MAX. In this
   paper, we implement both rules on a general purpose graphical processing
   unit (GPU). SUM-OF-SUM uses only matrix-vector multiplication and is
   easily implemented on the GPU, whereas SUM-OF-MAX, which involves
   non-linear operations, is much less straightforward to fulfill. However,
   SUM-OF-MAX gives significantly better retrieval error rates. We propose
   a hybrid scheme tailored for implementation on a GPU which achieves a
   880-fold speedup without sacrificing any accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The human brain is a complicated network made-up of a large number of
   regions, which are structurally and/or functionally connected. Recently,
   neuroimaging studies using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging have
   revealed that certain neural structures are highly active during periods
   of rest. Amongst several methods that have been developed to analyze
   resting-state fMRI data, Probabilistic Independent Component Analysis
   (PICA) is currently the most popular technique. The major challenge of
   using PICA is that resting-state networks are split into several
   components and visually extracting them can be difficult. In this paper,
   we propose a fast and precise algorithm based on advanced template
   matching in spatial domain such as Normalized Cross Correlation adapted
   to functional images in order to automatically extract the Default Mode
   Network (DMN) which is the task independent resting state network in the
   brain using PICA. We create a DMN template covering all reported regions
   in literature using two standard atlases. Ultimately, we reconstruct an
   image of the extracted DMN from PICA using an optimized decision making.
   Our approach was effective given that our algorithm results correlated
   highly with the DMN template.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive Radio (CR) is a paradigm for a more flexible and efficient
   usage of radio spectrum, where spectrum sensing is a vital function.
   When spectrum sensing is performed by several sensors in cooperation to
   overcome multipath fading and shadowing, a proper media access control
   (MAC) protocol is needed to coordinate the information exchange between
   sensors, and conserve resources. This work considers a dedicated
   wireless sensor network (WSN) for cooperative spectrum sensing, focusing
   on a spatial reuse MAC protocol. The MAC protocol is designed for a
   bandwidth limited system, and it is associated with the application of
   cooperative spectrum sensing. The design and implementation of such a
   protocol are discussed in detail, and performance numerical results for
   a specific scenario are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Associative memories are structures that store data patterns and
   retrieve them given partial inputs. Sparse Clustered Networks (SCNs) are
   recently-introduced binary-weighted associative memories that
   significantly improve the storage and retrieval capabilities over the
   prior state-of-the art. However, deleting or updating the data patterns
   result in a significant increase in the data retrieval error
   probability. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to address this
   problem by incorporating multiple-valued weights for the
   interconnections used in the network. The proposed algorithm lowers the
   error rate by an order of magnitude for our sample network with 60\%
   deleted contents. We then investigate the advantages of the proposed
   algorithm for hardware implementations.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present early results from a clinical trial of our
   time-domain microwave breast cancer screening system. The goal of the
   trial is to verify use of the system for a breast monitoring
   application. We follow four (healthy) patient volunteers and perform
   regular breast scans on them over a time period of eight months. We then
   compare the collected data and the reconstructed breast images from the
   scans. We show small variation in the signals collected from individual
   patients over time but also consistency in the corresponding images. Our
   results suggest that our system successfully avoids false positives over
   longer screening periods. The next step in our investigations is to
   determine if visible differences arise if malign tissue is present.}},
