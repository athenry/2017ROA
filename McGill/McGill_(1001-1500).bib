Abstract = {{A 3D control volume-based finite difference model was developed to
   simulate an industrial scale low-head direct chill (DC) slab casting
   process for the intermediate freezing range aluminium alloy AA3003. The
   model took into account the coupled nature of the turbulent melt flow
   and solidification heat transfer aspect of the direct chill casting
   (DCC) process. The model was used to predict the velocity and
   temperature fields. By post-processing, the temperature results, the
   sump depth and the mushy thickness at the centre of the slab and the
   shell thickness at the exit of the mould were calculated. Specifically,
   three important process parameters, namely, casting speed, melt
   superheat and effective heat transfer coefficient at the metal-mould
   contact region were varied in the range of 60 to 180 mm/min, 16 to 64
   degrees C, and 1.0 to 4.0 kW/m(2)K, respectively. Consistent with the
   industrial practice, in the mould, in the impingement and the free
   streaming regions, a step-wise increase of the cooling water temperature
   was considered. The predicted results were then critically analysed and
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A defined, straightforward top-down design method is proposed for
   developing inherently-stable, fast-settling high-order amplifiers. The
   method effectively defines the closed-loop response for a multistage
   amplifier through a desirable transfer function, such as of a
   time-domain filter, and combines an efficient gm-based procedure to
   implement a compact corresponding CMOS circuit. The amplifier will be
   composed of a cascade of gm-C integrators to supply the dc gain,
   followed by a stabilizing controller. Hence, several gain stages, more
   than the typical three, can be employed to build high-order structures
   that can achieve ultra-high gain. In support of the proposed approach, a
   four-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) with a
   third-order modified-Bessel unity-gain feedback response is implemented
   in 0.13-mu m CMOS. Simulation results demonstrate that the OTA achieves
   a dc gain of 78 dB and realizes the anticipated, pre-defined closed-loop
   response while driving a 1-pF capacitive load.}},

   states to realize various transfer functions and system orders. Gaussian
   transfer function is implemented as an example in this work. The chip is
   fabricated in the IBM 130 nm CMOS process, and measured data reveals DC
   gains ranging from 50 to 150 dB with a minimum 3-dB bandwidth of 10 kHz
   and a unity gain frequency of 10 MHz. This design principle is general

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) for single stage DC-DC conversion
   is emerging as an alternative solution to the two-stage DC-AC-DC
   conversion. The AC current, that only circulates inside of the MMC, is
   used to balance the energy between submodules (SMs). However, a high
   voltage conversion ratio will result in a high AC circulating current
   that will require high power electronic device ratings and cause high
   power losses. In this paper, a multiport modular multilevel DC-DC
   converter, which can have one high voltage port and multiple low voltage
   ports, is proposed. The power can flow from high voltage to low voltage
   ports or in the opposite direction. Especially for high voltage
   conversion ratio applications, the proposed converter needs lower
   circulating currents compared to the single-port MMC DC-DC converter.
   The large filtering inductor, which blocks the AC components from
   presenting at the low voltage DC side, is also eliminated. The proposed
   topology can be used to connect renewable energy systems or energy
   storage systems to a medium voltage DC grid.}},

   generalize the performance analysis to the multi-relay scenario with and
   without considering error propagation from the relays. For this scheme,
   we evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance in the presence of
   Rayleigh fading with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) receiver. From the
   obtained results it is seen that, similar to single relay scheme, the
   proposed MAP receiver attains the lower bound derived for multi-relay DF
   CR scheme also, and performs significantly better than the conventional
   schemes developed for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and
   memoryless impulsive noise channel. Moreover, the performance
   improvement of optimal MAP receiver over the memoryless receivers is
   substantial with increasing the number of relays.}},

Abstract = {{We consider Hybrid Automatic Repeat \& reQuest with Chase-combining

   system with base-stations (BSs) using large antenna arrays. Each BS uses
   a zero-forcing receiver and knows only the channel gains of users in its

   transmission rate (LATR) of the proposed HARQ-CC while limiting the
   number of retransmissions. We then formulate the optimal rate-selection
   problem for the proposed scheme and provide a method to find a solution.
   Since the optimal-rate selection method for the HARQ-CC scheme is
   computationally intensive, we develop a sub-optimal rate-selection
   technique that has a LATR performance close to that of the optimal
   method. Illustrative results show that the HARQ-CC requires less number
   of antennas than the non-HARQ scheme to achieve the same LATR
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate multiple input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems that operate with
   insufficient cyclic prefix (CP). Using a CP shorter than the channel
   delay spread can enable a significant improvement in bandwidth
   utilization or range extension for OFDM networks at the cost of
   increased inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference
   (ICI). We first analyze the effect of ICI and ISI on the received
   signal. A bi-directional M-algorithm (BDMA) is then proposed for
   high-performance trellis-based equalization to construct an iterative
   interference mitigation and detection process. Simulations show that,
   after only 2 iterations, the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed
   equalization scheme can converge to that of a sufficient-CP system even
   when the channel delay spread is 6 times longer than the insufficient
   CP.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the feasibility of producing environmentally
   friendly cement exclusively from industry wastes: ladle slag fines and
   fly ash. A low temperature clinkering process was implemented to produce
   a cement material capable of gaining early strength by carbonation and
   late strength by hydration. The optimum uses of fly ash and clinkering
   temperature were determined by undergoing meticulous parametric studies.
   The results of this investigation demonstrate that the higher the
   clinkering temperatures used, the higher the carbonation and hydration
   reactivity of the cement. The optimal fly ash ratio and temperature for
   synthesizing cement was found as 30\% and 1250 degrees C, respectively.
   The composite action generated by calcium carbonates and calcium
   silicate hydrates eventually plays an important role in gaining the
   strength. Production of cement with ladle slag and fly ash at low
   temperature can reduce the energy consumption, the natural resources
   consumption, landfills disposal cost, and the total CO2 emission.}},

   methods CGNE and CGNR. We then show the numerical equivalence of Lanczos
   tridiagonalization and Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization for any real
   skew-symmetric matrix A. We give short derivations of two algorithms for
   solving Ax = b with skew-symmetric A and use the above equivalence to
   show that these are numerically equivalent to the Golub-Kahan
   bidiagonalization variants of CGNE and CGNR. These last two numerical
   equivalences add to the theoretical equivalences in the work by
   Eisenstat {[}Equivalence of Krylov Subspace Methods for Skew-Symmetric
   Linear Systems, Department of Computer Science, Yale University,
   preprint, arXiv: 1512.00311, 2015] that unified and extended earlier

   process for minimizing parallel to A(T) (b - Ax(k))parallel to(2) when
   A(T) = -A and show that for skew-symmetric systems it is numerically
   equivalent to LSMR developed by Fong and Saunders {[}SIAM J. Sci.
   Comput., 33 (2011), pp. 2950-2971]. Finally, we illustrate the typical
   convergence behaviors of these algorithms with a numerical example and
   use these and an analysis to give new insights into algorithm choices
   for general large sparse matrix solution of equations problems.}},

   under different ratios of red to blue LEDs showed higher plant height,
   leaf, runner, inflorescence and crown number, fresh mass, and dry mass
   accumulation than that of plants cultured under HPS. The significantly
   higher fresh and dry mass accumulation were observed for strawberry
   plants cultured under 10:1 and 19:1 ratio of red to blue LEDs than HPS.
   The treatment 19:1 ratio of red to blue LED was significantly higher in
   inflorescences number and crown number than the other treatments. These
   results indicate that inflorescence production of strawberry plants is
   promoted by a higher level of red to blue light.}},

Abstract = {{Light emitting diodes (LEDs) can be selected to target the wavelengths

   evaluate the growth and antioxidant accumulation in coriander plants

   including: red LEDs (100\%) and three ratios of red (661 nm) to blue
   (449 nm) LEDs light (5:1, 10:1 and 19:1) at 120 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), were
   applied for this study. Coriander plants were cultured under different
   ratios of red to blue LEDs and were found to have an increase in the
   leaf and shoot number and fresh and dry mass than those plants cultured
   under 100\% red LEDs. The highest fresh and dry mass accumulation were
   observed in plants cultured under the 10:1 ratio of red to blue LEDs but
   were not significantly different from the 19:1 ratio of red to blue
   LEDs. The coriander plants cultured under 100\% red LEDs showed a
   significant decrease in antioxidant properties. This research will allow
   for improved selection of red to blue ratios of LEDs lighting for

Abstract = {{The proliferation of smart mobile devices and their increasing traffic

   to the limit. As such, WiFi virtualization has been positioned as a
   solution to accommodate and improve future communications, with many
   frameworks, protocols and algorithms being developed for virtualized
   networks. This work develops an experimental platform (testbed) for
   virtualized WiFi networks - namely the evolvable WiFi virtualization
   (eWV) platform - which researchers may use to transition from simulation
   to real-world development. Compared to related testbeds, eWV enables a
   richer and more versatile control over resources by exploiting
   reprogrammable software-defined radios. The design and performance of
   eWV's split-MAC architecture are presented and details of ongoing
   research are discussed as a demonstration of the wide range of research

Abstract = {{Although vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian flows are considerably lower
   in general during the nighttime, a higher number of accidents than
   expected occur during this time. A highly influential factor is the lack
   of visibility at nighttime. Several studies have shown the negative
   effects of the lack of visibility on bicycle and pedestrian accident
   frequency and injury severity at nighttime. However, these studies
   considered only the presence or absence of light, which was not
   sufficient to evaluate road user safety. Only a limited number of
   studies in this field actually measured nighttime road illuminance
   levels. This study relied on the collection of road illuminance data on
   road links during the nighttime in downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada,
   through the use of an illuminance sensor mounted on a scooter.
   Pedestrian and bicycle accident frequencies were analyzed separately
   with the use of the negative binomial model. Unexpectedly, the result
   showed that an increase in road lighting was associated with more
   bicycle and pedestrian accidents, which might have been explained by the
   decision to add or increase the amount of lighting at locations in which
   accidents occurred. The presence of a bike facility and arterial roads
   was associated with a decrease in bicycle accident occurrence. For
   pedestrians, the number of lanes per link and the pedestrian flow were
   associated with an increase in nighttime accident frequency, while the
   vehicle flow was associated with a decreasing number of accidents. The
   study called for more investigation of the precise relationship between
   safety and the amount of light provided by road lighting.}},

Abstract = {{Many probability distributions have been developed to model the extreme
   rainfall processes. However, there is no general agreement as to which
   distribution should be used. In the present study, a decision support
   tool for statistical modeling of extreme rainfall processes (SMExRain)
   was therefore developed to identify the most suitable distribution that
   could provide accurate extreme rainfall estimates. More specifically,
   the proposed tool can be used to assess the descriptive and predictive
   abilities of ten commonly-used probability models, Beta-K, Beta-P,
   Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Generalized Logistic (GLO), Generalized
   Normal (GNO), Generalized Pareto (GPA), Gumbel, Log-Pearson Type III
   (LP3), Pearson Type III (P3), and Wakeby, for their accuracy and
   robustness in the estimation of annual maximum precipitations. The
   proposed decision support tool was tested using 5-minute, 1-hour, and
   24-hour annual maximum precipitation data from a network of 21 raingages
   located in the Ontario region in Canada. Results based on various
   numerical and graphical goodness-of-fit criteria have indicated that the
   GEV, GNO, and P3 models were the best models for describing the
   distribution of annual maximum precipitations in this region. The GEV
   distribution, however, was preferred to the GNO and P3 because it
   requires a simpler parameter estimation method and it was based on a
   more solid theoretical basis for representing the distribution of
   extreme random variables. Therefore, the GEV could be recommended as the
   most suitable model for describing the distribution of annual maximum
   precipitations in Ontario region based on the proposed decision support
   tool. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle zeta-potentials are relatively easy to measure, and have
   consistently been proposed in guidance documents as a particle property
   that must be included for complete nanoparticle characterization. There
   is also an increasing interest in integrating data collected on
   nanomaterial properties and behavior measured in different systems (e.g.
   in vitro assays, surface water, soil) to identify the properties
   controlling nanomaterial fate and effects, to be able to integrate and
   reuse datasets beyond their original intent, and ultimately to predict
   behaviors of new nanomaterials based on their measured properties (i.e.
   read across), including zeta-potential. Several confounding factors pose
   difficulty in taking, integrating and interpreting this measurement
   consistently. Zeta-potential is a modeled quantity determined from
   measurements of the electrophoretic mobility in a suspension, and its
   value depends on the nanomaterial properties, the solution conditions,
   and the theoretical model applied. The ability to use zeta-potential as
   an explanatory variable for measured behaviors in different systems (or
   potentially to predict specific behaviors) therefore requires robust
   reporting with relevant meta-data for the measurement conditions and the
   model used to convert mobility measurements to zeta-potentials. However,
   there is currently no such standardization for reporting in the nanoEHS
   literature. The objective of this tutorial review is to familiarize the
   nanoEHS research community with the zeta-potential concept and the
   factors that influence its calculated value and interpretation,
   including the effects of adsorbed macromolecules. We also provide
   practical guidance on the precision of measurement, interpretation of
   zeta-potential as an explanatory variable for processes of interest
   (e.g. toxicity, environmental fate), and provide advice for addressing
   common challenges associated with making meaningful zeta-potential
   measurements using commercial instruments. Finally, we provide specific
   guidance on the parameters that need to be reported with zetapotential
   measurements to maximize interpretability and to support scientific
   synthesis across data sets.}},

Abstract = {{Small molecules (MW < 1000 Da) represent a large class of biomarkers of
   interest. Recently, a new class of biosensors has been emerging thanks
   to the recognition properties of aptamers, short DNA or RNA single
   strands, selected against such small molecular targets. Among them, an
   adenosine-specific aptamer has been largely described and used due to
   its remarkable affinity to this small target (K-D = 6 mu M). In this
   paper, we achieved the proof-of-principle of an aptasensor based on the
   thermodynamic follow-up of adenosine binding with engineered
   split-aptamer sequences. The detection is carried out by surface plasmon
   resonance imaging of split-aptamer micro-arrays, while signal
   amplification is ensured by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). This original
   approach based on DNA sequence engineering and AuNP conjugation enabled
   us to reach limits of detection (LOD) 200 times lower than the KD
   measured in solution with the native aptamer (LOD = 30 nM).}},

Abstract = {{3D four-directional braided composites are becoming widely used in the
   aeroengines due to their excellent transverse properties such as
   stiffness, strength, fracture toughness and damage resistance. In spite
   of great achievements in composite materials, the model of 3D
   four-directional braided composites gives rise to considerable challenge
   in establishing interior fiber bundle structure which is curved and
   twisted in jamming condition. Original circular cross-section of fiber
   bundle is squeezed into oval shape ellipse in manufacturing process of
   the jamming action. Thus, a novel mesoscopic modeling approach for 3D
   four-directional braided composites was proposed in this study, which
   considered the fiber bundle cross-section's deformation. Firstly, an
   analytic equation to describe the transfoimation of fiber bundle
   cross-section was established based on the equal area of the ellipse and
   circle. Secondly, the parameters of this equation were achieved using
   the Matlab simulation. It was concluded that the compacted,
   non-interfered fiber bundle model constructed was in good agreement with
   actual structure. This paper provides the mathematical relationship
   between braiding parameters and geometric dimensions of unit cell model.
   Numerical results showed that the value of braiding pitch length has a
   relative calculation error less than 4\% compared with test data. The
   modeling technique lays a foundation for further mesomechanics
   investigation on 3D four-directional braided composites.}},

Abstract = {{Modern aircraft engine designs feature reduced clearances that may
   initiate structural contacts between rotating and static components. A
   numerical strategy dedicated to the simulation of such interactions is
   here enriched in order to account for time-dependent angular speeds.
   This contribution first details the evolution of the numerical strategy
   before validating the developments by comparing numerical results with
   experimental observations made on an industrial test bench. Further
   numerical investigations allow to assess the sensitivity of numerical
   results to acceleration and deceleration rates. Results, obtained with
   and without abradable coating, underline the fundamental nonlinear
   nature of the analysed system. It is found that lower acceleration rates
   favour the arisal of interaction phenomena and that amplitudes of
   vibration at a given angular speed are generally lower when the blade
   decelerates.}},

Title = {{Electrokinetics of nanoparticle gel-electrophoresis}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{38}},
Pages = {{8030-8048}},
Abstract = {{Gel-electrophoresis has been demonstrated in recent decades to
   successfully sort a great variety of nanoparticles according to their
   size, charge, surface chemistry, and corona architecture. However,
   quantitative theoretical interpetations have been limited by the number
   and complexity of factors that influence particle migration. Theoretical
   models have been fragmented and incomplete with respect to their
   counterparts for free-solution electrophoresis. This paper unifies
   electrokinetic models that address complex nanoparticle corona
   architectures, corona and gel charge regulation (e.g., by the local pH),
   multi-component electrolytes, and non-linear electrostatics and
   relaxation effects. By comprehensively addressing the electrokinetic
   aspects of the more general gel-electrophoresis problem, in which
   short-ranged steric interactions are significant, a stage is set to
   better focus on the physicochemical and steric factors. In this manner,
   it is envisioned that noparticle gel-electrophoresis may eventually be
   advanced from a nanoparticle-characterization tool to one that
   explicitly probes the short-ranged interactions of nanoparticles with
   soft networks, such as synthetic gels and biological tissues. In this
   paper, calculations are undertaken that identify a generalized Huckel
   limit for nanoparticles in low-conductivity gels, and a new Smoluchowski
   limit for polyelectrolyte-coated particles in high-conductivity gels
   that is independent of the gel permeability. Also of fundamental
   interest is a finite, albeit small, electrophoretic mobility for
   uncharged particles in charged gels. Electrophoretic mobilities and drag
   coefficients (with electroviscous effects) for nanoparticles bearing
   non-uniform coronas show that relaxation effects are typically weak for
   the small nanoparticles (radius approximate to 3-10 nm) to which
   gel-electrophoresis has customarily been applied, but are profound for
   the larger nanoparticles (radius greater than or similar to 40 nm in low
   conductivity gels) to which passivated gel-electrophoresis experiments
   have recently been applied. To demonstrate its practical application,
   the model is applied to (pH charge regulating) carboxylated polystyrene
   nanospheres in low-density passivated agarose gels (weak steric
   effects). This furnishes a new theoretical interpretation of literature
   data for which a finite diffuse-layer-thickness, pH-charge regulation,
   high charge, and relaxation effects dominate over the steric influences.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the relationships between soil properties, topographic
   features, and their impact on fruit yield is an important component of
   site-specific nutrient management. This article presents research that
   investigates the relationship between soil properties and fruit yield to
   provide a better understanding of their variation with respect to change
   in slope within selected wild blueberry fields. Two wild blueberry
   fields were selected and completely randomized experiments were
   constructed at each site. The selected sites were divided into five
   slope categories: 0 < 5 degrees (Category 1), 5 degrees < 9 degrees
   (Category 2), 9 degrees < 13 degrees (Category 3), 13 degrees < 16
   degrees (Category 4), and => 16 degrees (Category 5). Soil samples were
   collected from each slope category and analyzed for pH, texture,
   electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic matter (SOM), and inorganic
   nitrogen (NH4+-N, NO3--N). The slope, volumetric moisture content (theta
   v), and fruit yield data were also collected from each slope category.
   Soil variables, slope and fruit yield data were replicated ten times in
   each slope category.
   The significant correlation between the SOM, EC, theta v, NH4+-N,
   NO3--N, clay content, fruit yield, and slope suggested that wild
   blueberry yield is greatly influenced by variations in slope and soil
   properties. Multiple regression models explained > 75\% (p < 0.001) of
   the variability in fruit yield as a result of slope and soil properties.
   Regression analysis reported that slope alone explained >57\% of the
   variability in fruit yield within selected fields. Soil properties and
   fruit yield were significantly different in various slope categories.
   Multiple means comparison suggested higher fertility and fruit yield in
   the low slope category, with a decreasing trend with increasing slope.
   Negative correlations of slope with soil properties and fruit yield and
   their variation in different slope categories emphasize the need to
   develop slope based management zones for site-specific fertilization in
   wild blueberry fields. Site-specific fertilization can enhance input use
   efficiency, increase profit margins and reduce environmental risks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an overview on the topic of noise reduction in

   subtractive methods, Wiener filter based methods, speech amplitude
   estimators and estimators of the complex STFT coefficients. In the
   multi-channel scenario, we investigate in short a selection of key
   beamforming approaches as well as conventional post-filtering methods.
   Next, a detailed survey of the most recent advances in the STFT-based
   noise reduction methods is provided. This includes STSA estimators with
   super-Gaussian priors, noise power spectral density (PSD) estimation,
   estimation methods in the modulation domain, estimation of spectral
   phase and noise PSD matrix estimation for multi-channel applications.

Title = {{A Phase II Study of Fornix Deep Brain Stimulation in Mild Alzheimer's
   Disease}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE}},

Abstract = {{Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to modulate the
   activity of dysfunctional brain circuits. The safety and efficacy of DBS
   in dementia is unknown.
   Objective: To assess DBS of memory circuits as a treatment for patients
   with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   Methods: We evaluated active ``on{''} versus sham ``off{''} bilateral
   DBS directed at the fornix-a major fiber bundle in the brain's memory
   circuit-in a randomized, double-blind trial (ClinicalTrials. gov
   NCT01608061) in 42 patients with mild AD. We measured cognitive function
   and cerebral glucose metabolism up to 12 months post-implantation.
   Results: Surgery and electrical stimulation were safe and well
   tolerated. There were no significant differences in the primary
   cognitive outcomes (ADAS-Cog 13, CDR-SB) in the ``on{''} versus
   ``off{''} stimulation group at 12 months for the whole cohort. Patients
   receiving stimulation showed increased metabolism at 6 months but this
   was not significant at 12 months. On post-hoc analysis, there was a
   significant interaction between age and treatment outcome: in contrast
   to patients <65 years old (n = 12) whose results trended toward being
   worse with DBS ON versus OFF, in patients >= 65 (n = 30) DBS-f ON
   treatment was associated with a trend toward both benefit on clinical
   outcomes and a greater increase in cerebral glucose metabolism.
   Conclusion: DBS for AD was safe and associated with increased cerebral
   glucose metabolism. There were no differences in cognitive outcomes for
   participants as a whole, but participants aged >= 65 years may have
   derived benefit while there was possible worsening in patients below age
   65 years with stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{We recently developed capillaric circuits (CCs) - advanced capillary
   microfluidic devices assembled from capillary fluidic elements in a
   modular manner similar to the design of electric circuits (Safavieh \&
   Juncker, Lab Chip, 2013, 13, 4180-4189). CCs choreograph liquid delivery
   operations according to pre-programmed capillary pressure differences
   with minimal user intervention. CCs were thought to require
   high-precision micron-scale features manufactured by conventional
   photolithography, which is slow and expensive. Here we present CCs
   manufactured rapidly and inexpensively using 3D-printed molds. Molds for
   CCs were fabricated with a benchtop 3D-printer, poly(dimethylsiloxane)
   replicas were made, and fluidic functionality was verified with aqueous
   solutions. We established design rules for CCs by a combination of
   modelling and experimentation. The functionality and reliability of
   trigger valves - an essential fluidic element that stops one liquid
   until flow is triggered by a second liquid - was tested for different
   geometries and different solutions. Trigger valves with geometries up to
   80-fold larger than cleanroom-fabricated ones were found to function
   reliably. We designed retention burst valves that encode sequential
   liquid delivery using capillary pressure differences encoded by
   systematically varied heights and widths. Using an electrical circuit
   analogue of the CC, we established design rules to ensure strictly
   sequential liquid delivery. CCs autonomously delivered eight liquids in
   a pre-determined sequence in <7 min. Taken together, our results
   demonstrate that 3D-printing lowers the bar for other researchers to
   access capillary microfluidic valves and CCs for autonomous liquid
   delivery with applications in diagnostics, research and education.}},

Abstract = {{The poor dispersibility and stability of graphene and its derivatives in
   aqueous media is an influential limitation in the biological
   applications of graphene based nanomaterials. The aim of this study is
   to improve the solubility and dispersibility of reduced graphene oxide
   (rGO) in cell culture media and serum using three amphiphilic polymers
   (polystyrene-co-polyacrylic acid (PS-PAA),
   polystyrene-co-poly4-vinylpyridine (PS-P4V) and
   phospholipid-polyethylene glycol (PL-PEG)) as first layer coating
   materials. A cationic cell penetrating peptide, octaarginine (R8), is
   incorporated as a second layer on the selected formulation to enhance
   the cell internalization capability of the stabilized rGO. Chemical,
   physical and biological properties of the double-layer coated (DLC)-rGO
   are fully characterized. The cellular uptake of fluorescein
   isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled DLC-rGO is evaluated using confocal
   microscopy. None of the polymer-functionalized rGO samples show cell
   toxicity. While the amount of immobilized PL-PEG on the rGO surface is
   less than PS-PAA and PS-P4V, much higher dispersibility is observed than
   with other copolymers. Furthermore, the R8 coated rGO-PL-PEG shows great
   cell internalization ability after 4 h incubation with MCF-7 cells. It
   is concluded that DLC-rGO could have great potential to be used as a
   nanocarrier in the biomolecular delivery of biological materials such as
   drugs and genes.}},

Abstract = {{Breathing is an unconscious and unheeded function occurs about 20,000
   times per day and 10 million times per year by a healthy individual.
   Unlike other unconscious functions of the body, breathing can be
   controlled and regulated voluntarily. Breathing therapy was introduced
   to help people gradually refine their breathing patterns in terms of
   respiration rate and volume. It is very important for people to perform
   the exact instructions since otherwise it may cause lung problems.
   Therefore, the breath specialists and physicians try to provide
   instructions and feedback over multiple practice sessions. To overcome
   these limitations, this work proposes and investigates artificial
   tactile stimuli for providing instructions and feedback on performance
   of breathing exercises in real time. The proposed system comprises of a
   single wearable sensor that models the breathing functions from the
   interior/posterior motions of the subject's umbilical region integrated
   with a vibration motor to provide haptic biofeedback during breathing
   therapy. The results are investigated based on five different yogic
   breathing patterns with 10 healthy volunteers. Experimental tests have
   shown more than 40\% improvement in users' performance in breathing
   therapy when applying haptic feedback. This shows a potential to enrich
   the quality of wearable and portable advisory-based systems through the
   touch channel.}},

Abstract = {{Dense inorganic nanoparticles have recently been identified as promising
   radiosensitizers. In addition to dose enhancement through increased
   attenuation of ionizing radiation relative to biological tissue,
   scintillating nanoparticles can transfer energy to coupled
   photosensitizers to amplify production of reactive oxygen species, as
   well as provide UV-visible emission for optical imaging. Lanthanum
   fluoride is a transparent material that is easily prepared as
   nanocrystals, and which can provide radioluminescence at a number of
   wavelengths through simple substitution of lanthanum ions with other
   luminescent lanthanides. We have prepared lanthanum fluoride
   nanoparticles doped with cerium, terbium, or both, that have good
   spectral overlap with chlorin e6 or Rose Bengal photosensitizer
   molecules. We have also developed a strategy for stable conjugation of
   the photosensitizers to the nanoparticle surface, allowing for high
   energy transfer efficiencies on a per molecule basis. Additionally, we
   have succeeded in making our conjugates colloidally stable under
   physiological conditions. Here we present our latest results, using
   nanoparticles and nanoparticle-photosensitizer conjugates to demonstrate
   radiation dose enhancement in B16 melanoma cells. The effects of
   nanoparticle treatment prior to 250 kVp x-ray irradiation were
   investigated through clonogenic survival assays and cell cycle analysis.
   Using a custom apparatus, we have also observed scintillation of the
   nanoparticles and conjugates under the same conditions that the cell
   samples are irradiated.}},

Abstract = {{The monolithic integration of red, green and blue (RGB) GaN-based
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs) directly on a single chip is critically
   important for smart lighting and full color display applications. In
   this work, RGB InGaN/GaN dot-in-a-wire LED arrays were laterally
   arranged on a Si wafer using a three-step SiOx-mask selective area
   growth (SAG) technique, and on a sapphire wafer using a Ti-mask SAG
   technique. Tunable emission across the entire visible spectral range
   (similar to 450 nm to 700 nm) can be readily achieved on a single Si
   wafer by varying the sizes and/or compositions of the dots. By
   separately biasing lateral-arranged multi-color LED subpixels, the
   correlated color temperature (CCT) values of such a similar to 0.016
   mm(2) pixel can be varied from similar to 1900 K to 6800 K. The RGB
   pixel size can be further reduced by using the Ti-mask SAG technique on
   sapphire wafer. Full-color InGaN/GaN nanowire arrays with sizes of 2.8 x
   2.8 mu m(2) have been monolithically fabricated into the same pixel.}},

   detonation analog. The analog system consists of a reactive Burgers'
   equation coupled with an Arrhenius type reaction wave, and the
   heterogeneity of the explosive media is mimicked using a discrete energy
   source approach. The governing equation is solved using a second order,
   finite-volume approach and the average propagation velocity of the
   discrete detonation is determined by tracking the leading shock front.
   Consistent with previous studies, the averaged velocity of the leading
   shock front from the unsteady numerical simulations is also found to be
   in good agreement with the velocity of a CJ detonation in a uniform
   medium wherein the energy source is spatially homogenized. These
   simulations have thus implications for whether the CJ criterion is valid
   to predict the detonation velocity in heterogeneous explosive media.}},

Pages = {{1381-1394}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the development of a framework for assessment of
   sustainability of bridges, including related technical, economic,
   environmental and social issues. Sustainable infrastructure assets
   require diligent conception and design of facilities (with diligent
   choice of materials and construction techniques), high quality
   construction, and operations, involving routine maintenance, with
   optimised life-cycle performance and costs, and minimum impact on the
   environment over a stipulated long service life and beyond. Partial
   details of design, construction, maintenance and
   rehabilitation/renovation of the four versions of the 3-km long Victoria
   Bridge (1859, 1898, 1958 and 1988) are summarised, along with the
   partial details of design, construction, severe deterioration and
   subsequent rehabilitation of the nearly 6-km long, 6-lane Champlain
   Bridge. Sustainability of both bridges was assessed by implementing the
   proposed sustainability framework developed in this research programme,
   along with the use of the analytical hierarchy process which involved
   evaluation of pairwise comparison of the various categories to assist
   with evaluation of the sustainability scores. These scores indicate that
   all four forms of Victoria Bridge (1859, 1898, 1958 and 1988) are
   partially sustainable, or sustainable, while the Champlain Bridge is
   unsustainable. This framework can be appropriately adapted for assessing
   the sustainability of other infrastructure assets.}},

Abstract = {{When software is maintained and evolved the build configuration also
   needs to be updated. Knowing when to update the build configuration is
   typically done manually with the risk of missing an update and breaking
   the build. To mitigate this risk, previous work has investigated
   prediction models to help developers to identify commits that will
   likely involve an update of the build configuration.
   In this paper, we investigate whether we can improve these existing
   prediction models by taking into account detailed information on source
   code changes and commit categories. Our main hypothesis is that such
   detailed information on changes will significantly improve the
   prediction of build co-changes.
   To that extent, we extract information on changes from 10 Java open
   source projects and use a random forest classifier to train models that
   predict build co-changes within and across projects. Our results show
   significant improvements over existing prediction models: the AUC for
   intra- and cross-project prediction improves by 11.54\% and 9.46\%
   respectively. In addition, we investigate advanced resampling techniques
   to explore the effect of unbalanced data on our models. The results show
   that SMOTE can particularly improve prediction models with low
   performance that were trained on unbalanced data. Our models improve the
   prediction and enable a better understanding of build co-changes.}},

Abstract = {{Meat is an important food item in human diet. Its production and
   consumption has greatly increased in the last decades with the
   development of economies and improvement of peoples' living standards.
   However, most of the traditional methods for evaluation of meat quality
   are time-consuming, laborious, inconsistent and destructive to samples,
   which make them not appropriate for a fast-paced production and
   processing environment. Development of innovative and non-destructive
   optical sensing techniques to facilitate simple, fast, and accurate
   evaluation of quality are attracting increasing attention in the food
   industry. Hyperspectral imaging is one of the promising techniques. It
   integrates the combined merits of imaging and spectroscopic techniques.
   This paper provides a comprehensive review on recent advances in
   evaluation of the important quality attributes of meat including color,
   marbling, tenderness, pH, water holding capacity, and also chemical
   composition attributes such as moisture content, protein content and fat
   content in pork, beef and lamb. In addition, the future potential

Abstract = {{Platforms capable of generating rich haptic feedback are usually quite

   small-form parallel robotic mechanism that features a simple
   vibrotactile actuator at the end-effector. The robotic arm is optically
   transparent and is motorized at the base where it clips on a tablet or

   custom designed board based on the Arduino Due microcontroller. This
   board interfaces computer software to the Haplet's hardware with a
   capacity of up to four motors and encoders and two vibrotactile

Abstract = {{Hybrid simulation can provide significant advantages for large-scale
   experimental investigations of the seismic response of structures
   through collapse, particularly when considering cost and safety of
   conventional shake table tests. Hybrid simulation, however, has its own
   challenges and special attention must be paid to mitigate potential
   numerical and experimental errors that can propagate throughout the
   simulation. Several case studies are presented here to gain insight into
   the factors influencing the accuracy and stability of hybrid simulation
   from the linear-elastic response range through collapse. The hybrid
   simulations were conducted on a four-story two-bay moment frame with
   various substructuring configurations. Importantly, the structural
   system examined here was previously tested on a shake table with the
   same loading sequence, allowing for direct evaluation of the hybrid
   simulation results. The sources of error examined include: (1)
   computational stability in numerical substructure; (2) setup and
   installation of the physical specimen representing the experimental
   substructure; and (3) the accuracy of the selected substructuring
   technique that handles the boundary conditions and continuous exchange
   of data between the subassemblies. Recommendations are made regarding
   the effective mitigation of the various sources of errors. It is shown
   that by controlling errors, hybrid simulation can provide reliable
   results for collapse simulation by comparison to shake table testing.}},

Abstract = {{The applicability of a high resolution low-pass differential spatial
   filter for unstructured grids was investigated for typical high-order
   one-dimensional Finite Element methods. The goal was to investigate the
   accuracy and stability of the filter when applied on high-order
   elements. The one-dimensional differential filter was discretized based
   on Lagrange and Hierarchical Legendre base functions. Manufactured
   solutions were used to demonstrate the performance of the filter on two
   one-dimensional test cases for elements of order up to six. The results
   suggest that the proposed filter is effective for explicit filtering in
   Large Eddy Simulations using high-order methods.}},

Title = {{Power Allocation for Buffer-Aided Full-Duplex Relaying With Imperfect
   Self-Interference Cancelation and Statistical Delay Constraint}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{3961-3974}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers source and relay power allocation for buffer-aided
   full-duplex (B-ED) relaying network, assuming constant data rate
   arrivals at the source buffer. Statistical delay constraint is imposed,
   where the end-to-end queue length is allowed to exceed a pre-defined
   queue-length threshold with a maximum acceptable queue-length-outage
   probability. We assume imperfect self-interference (SI) cancelation,
   where the non-zero residual SI power is modeled to be proportional to
   the relay transmit power. We investigate two power allocation problems
   for source arrival rate maximization: 1) B-ED relaying with adaptive
   power allocation (B-ED-APA) when the instantaneous channel state
   information at the transmitters (CSIT) is available and 2) B-FD relaying
   with static power allocation (B-ED-SPA) when only the statistical CSIT
   is available. To solve the problems, we first employ asymptotic delay
   analysis to transform the statistical delay constraint into more
   tractable constraints. Then, the optimal solutions are derived using
   Lagrangian approach. In addition, solutions for various special cases of
   residual SI and delay constraint are presented. With B-ED-APA, the relay
   can opportunistically switch between half-duplex (HD) and ED operation
   modes according to the channel conditions. With B-ED-SPA, the relay
   always employs ED mode. Numerical results are performed to compare the
   capacities of the proposed B-ED, non-buffer ED, and buffer aided HD
   relaying schemes, as well as direct transmission (DT) under various
   settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of B-ED relaying to support
   delay-constrained communications.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{34}},
Pages = {{15376-15388}},
Abstract = {{Electrohydrodynamic printing (EHDP), based on the
   electrohydrodynamically induced flow of materials, enables the
   production of micro/nanoscale fibers or droplets and has recently
   attracted extensive interest to fabricate user-specific patterns in a
   controlled and high-efficiency manner. However, most of the existing
   EHDP techniques can only print two-dimensional (2D) micropatterns which
   cannot meet the increasing demands for the direct fabrication of
   three-dimensional (3D) microdevices. The integration of EHDP techniques
   with the layer-by-layer stacking principle of additive manufacturing has
   emerged as a promising solution to this limitation. Here we present a
   state-of-the-art review on the translation of 2D EHDP technique into a
   viable micro/nanoscale 3D printing strategy. The working principle,
   essential components as well as critical process parameters for EHDP are
   discussed. We highlight recent explorations on both solution-based and
   melt-based 3D EHDP techniques in cone-jet and microdripping modes for
   the fabrication of multimaterial structures, microelectronics and
   biological constructs. Finally, we discuss the major challenges as well
   as possible solutions with regard to translating the 3D EHDP process
   into a real micro/nanoscale additive manufacturing strategy for the
   freeform fabrication of 3D structures.}},

Title = {{Hydrogel-colloid interfacial interactions: a study of tailored adhesion
   using optical tweezers}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{31}},
Pages = {{6575-6587}},
Abstract = {{Dynamics of colloidal particles adhering to soft, deformable substrates,
   such as tissues, biofilms, and hydrogels play a key role in many
   biological and biomimetic processes. These processes, including, but not
   limited to colloid-based delivery, stitching, and sorting, involve
   microspheres exploring the vicinity of soft, sticky materials in which
   the colloidal dynamics are affected by the fluid environment (e.g.,
   viscous coupling), inter-molecular interactions between the colloids and
   substrates (e.g., Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory), and
   the viscoelastic properties of contact region. To better understand
   colloidal dynamics at soft interfaces, an optical tweezers
   back-focal-plane interferometry apparatus was developed to register the
   transverse Brownian motion of a silica microsphere in the vicinity of
   polyacrylamide (PA) hydrogel films. The time-dependent mean-squared
   displacements are well described by a single exponential relaxation,
   furnishing measures of the transverse interfacial diffusion coefficient
   and binding stiffness. Substrates with different elasticities were
   prepared by changing the PA crosslinking density, and the
   inter-molecular interactions were adjusted by coating the microspheres
   with fluid membranes. Stiffer PA hydrogels (with bulk Young's moduli
   E1-10 kPa) immobilize the microspheres more firmly (lower diffusion
   coefficient and position variance), and coating the particles with
   zwitterionic lipid bilayers (DOPC) completely eliminates adhesion,
   possibly by repulsive dispersion forces. Remarkably, embedding
   polyethylene glycol-grafted lipid bilayers (DSPE-PEG2k-Amine) in the
   zwitterionic fluid membranes produces stronger adhesion, possibly
   because of polymer-hydrogel attraction and entanglement. This study
   provides new insights to guide the design of nanoparticles and
   substrates with tunable adhesion, leading to smarter delivery, sorting,
   and screening of micro-and nano-systems.}},

   hysteresis}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{6868-6882}},
Abstract = {{We study the stability and breakup of liquid bridges with a free contact
   line on surfaces with contactangle hysteresis (CAH) under zero-gravity
   conditions. Non-ideal surfaces exhibit CAH because of surface
   imperfections, by which the constraints on three-phase contact lines are
   influenced. Given that interfacial instabilities are
   constraint-sensitive, understanding how CAH affects the stability and
   breakup of liquid bridges is crucial for predicting the drop size in
   contact-drop dispensing. Unlike ideal surfaces on which contact lines
   are always free irrespective of surface wettability, contact lines may
   undergo transitions from pinned to free and vice versa during drop
   deposition on non-ideal surfaces. Here, we experimentally and
   theoretically examine how stability and breakup are affected by CAH,
   highlighting cases where stability is lost during a transition from a
   pinned-pinned (more constrained) to pinned-free (less constrained)
   interface-rather than a critical state. This provides a practical means
   of expediting or delaying stability loss. We also demonstrate how the
   dynamic contact angle can control the contact-line radius following
   stability loss.}},

Title = {{Deriving Local Operating Distributions to Estimate Transit Bus Emissions
   Across an Urban Network}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2570}},
Pages = {{57-68}},
Abstract = {{In a 6-week data collection campaign, instantaneous bus speeds and
   ridership data were collected onboard 96 buses operating over 3,700 road
   links. Emissions were estimated by using the Motor Vehicle Emission
   Simulator 2014 version (MOVES2014). The effects of bus type and
   passenger load were explicitly accounted for in the emissions estimation
   process. The resulting emissions figures exhibit networkwide variations
   across different time periods, directions, land uses, passenger
   ridership figures, and transit service. Per passenger emissions data
   highlight the importance of considering onboard passenger weight in the
   estimation process. These results are relevant to transit planners who
   are evaluating plans to modify or introduce bus routes. This study also
   demonstrated a process in which local operating mode distributions were
   generated and specific drive cycles were developed for different average
   speeds and then were embedded into the MOVES2014 database. A validation
   test suggested that emissions figures derived using the locally
   developed operating mode distributions were better than and largely
   different from the emissions figures obtained using the MOVES default
   distributions. These embedded drive cycles could be useful when
   instantaneous speed information is unavailable, especially when
   developing a regional inventory for bus emissions in Montreal, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding when, how, and if bacteria swim is key to understanding
   critical ecological and biological processes, from carbon cycling to
   infection. Imaging motility by traditional light microscopy is limited
   by focus depth, requiring cells to be constrained in z. Holographic
   microscopy offers an instantaneous 3D snapshot of a large sample volume,
   and is therefore ideal in principle for quantifying unconstrained
   bacterial motility. However, resolving and tracking individual cells is
   difficult due to the low amplitude and phase contrast of the cells; the
   index of refraction of typical bacteria differs from that of water only
   at the second decimal place. In this work we present a combination of
   optical and samplehandling approaches to facilitating bacterial tracking
   by holographic phase imaging. The first is the design of the microscope,
   which is an off-axis design with the optics along a common path, which
   minimizes alignment issues while providing all of the advantages of
   off-axis holography. Second, we use anti-reflective coated etalon glass
   in the design of sample chambers, which reduce internal reflections.
   Improvement seen with the antireflective coating is seen primarily in
   phase imaging, and its quantification is presented here. Finally, dyes
   may be used to increase phase contrast according to the Kramers-Kronig
   relations. Results using three test strains are presented, illustrating
   the different types of bacterial motility characterized by an enteric
   organism (Escherichia coli), an environmental organism (Bacillus
   subtilis), and a marine organism (Vibrio alginolyticus). Data processing
   steps to increase the quality of the phase images and facilitate

Abstract = {{A pitch-roll joystick based on a spherical cam mechanism is proposed
   that can be implemented as a haptics device. Spherical cams can replace
   the bevel gears that are conventionally used in transmission mechanisms
   involving shafts with intersecting axes to achieve lower backlash, lower
   frictional losses and higher stiffness. Such a spherical cam mechanism
   is essentially composed of multi-lobe-cams and conical rollers.
   Undercutting is a deterrent to the generation of smooth cam surfaces,
   which calls for the synthesis of a singularity-free spherical cam
   profile. The issues of high pressure angle and high contact ratio are
   addressed by means of a multilobe cam. The design of the cam profile and
   the assembly of the joystick are described. The criteria for the
   selection of the numbers of lobes and rollers are also explained.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of electric vehicle as a fully automated mobile robot -
   a.k.a. X-by-Wire, or Drive-by-Wire (DbW) concepts - is becoming more and
   more attractive in the modern automotive industry. This idea is based on
   replacing a mechanical subsystem by its electronic equivalent, which
   includes sensors and actuators, with a computer in-between. Three of the
   components, namely Throttle-by-Wire, Brake-by-Wire, and Steer-by-Wire,
   are the most complex and risky elements of the X-by-Wire technology.
   Moreover, these elements constitute the inherent part of the general DbW
   paradigm. This paper reports work-in-progress on the design and
   prototyping of a scaled-down 1 : 6 proof-of-concept model of a
   commercial vehicle with an integrated X-by-Wire system. The control for
   its components is discussed, while emphasizing the Steer-by-Wire
   actuator based on the Ackermann condition. The influence of heading
   velocity and turning angle on the slipping angle and path error of the
   model is discussed. The performance of the dynamics of the prototype is
   assessed over prescribed paths; deviations from the no-slip condition
   are evaluated.}},

   Critical to the design of cam mechanisms is the generation of the

   contacts are characterized based on kinematic constraints while the

   formulation is a significant dimension reduction in the resulting linear
   complementarity problem in comparison with its counterpart formulations
   in the literature. Moreover, the dimension can be even further reduced
   by removing the velocity variables from the formulation. The proposed

Abstract = {{In Mechanics the core issue is the representation of forces. The concept
   of inertia is central in such definition. In finite degree-of-freedom
   dynamics models of a mechanical system inertia is generally represented
   based on the gradients of the kinetic energy function in terms of the
   selected generalized velocities. This selection of variables gives the
   parameterization of the system and allows one to gain insight into the
   nature of the behaviour and functioning of the system. A certain
   operation or interaction in a system can be characterized by selecting
   the proper parameterization. This also gives rise to the possibility to
   define effective inertia concepts that are particularly important to
   understand a function or an operation within a system. In this paper we
   present novel forms and concepts of effective inertia.}},

Abstract = {{The well-known concept of normal mode for linear systems, has been
   extended to the framework of nonlinear dynamics over the course of the
   20th century, initially by Lyapunov, and later by Rosenberg and a
   growing community of researchers in modal and vibration analysis. This
   effort has mainly targeted nonlinear smooth systems the velocity is
   continuous and differentiable in time even though systems presenting
   nonsmooth occurrences have been increasingly studied in the last decades
   to face the growing industrial need of unilateral contact and friction
   simulations. Yet, these systems have nearly never been explored from the
   standpoint of modal analysis.
   This contribution addresses the notion of modal analysis of nonsmooth
   systems. Developments are illustrated on a seemingly simple 2-dof
   autonomous system, subject to unilateral constraints reflected by a
   perfectly elastic impact law: Even though friction is ignored, its
   dynamics appears to be extremely rich. Periodic solutions are sought for
   given numbers of impacts per period and nonsmooth modes are illustrated
   for one and two impacts per period in the form of two-dimensional
   manifolds in the phase space. Also, an unexpected bridge between these
   modes in the frequency-energy plots is observed.}},

Abstract = {{The Wave Finite Element Method (WFEM) is implemented to accurately
   capture travelling waves propagating at a finite speed within a bouncing
   rod system and induced by unilateral contact collisions with a rigid
   foundation; friction is not accounted for. As opposed to the traditional
   Finite Element Method (FEM) within a time-stepping framework, potential
   discontinuous deformation, stress and velocity wave fronts are
   accurately described, which is critical for the problem of interest.
   A one-dimensional benchmark with an analytical solution is investigated.
   The WFEM is compared to two time-stepping solution methods formulated on
   a FEM semi-discretization in space: (1) an explicit technique involving
   Lagrange multipliers and (2) a non-smooth approach implemented in the
   Siconos package. Attention is paid to the Gibb's phenomenon generated
   during and after contact occurrences together with the time evolution of
   the total energy of the system.
   It is numerically found that the WFEM outperforms the FEM and Siconos
   solution methods because it does not induce any spurious oscillations or
   dispersion and diffusion of the shock wave. Furthermore, energy is not
   dissipated over time. More importantly, the WFEM does not require any
   impact law to close the system of governing equations.}},

Abstract = {{Improving the mobility of wheeled robots operating on unstructured
   terrain is a challenging task that can be approached in different ways.
   Enhanced mobility results in the vehicle being able to successfully
   negotiate slopes and obstacles, expanding the range of missions that can
   be undertaken and reducing the risk of losing or damaging the robot.
   This goal is directly related to optimizing the way in which traction
   force is developed at the wheel-terrain contact interfaces. Several
   strategies to achieve this objective, including traction control
   algorithms and reconfiguration, have been proposed in the literature. In
   this work, internal actuation is explored as a means to obtain better
   mobility on soft and irregular terrain. The use of this technique is
   demonstrated with a rover prototype in three maneuvers, namely flat soft
   terrain traverse, slope climbing on soft terrain, and negotiation of a
   step obstacle. Results show that redundant actuation can be used to
   improve the behavior of the vehicle, for optimum mobility on soft and
   irregular terrain.}},

   Moreover, both the inflection and the elliptic cones, which represent

   the spherical motion in terms of the curvature of a coupler curve and
   both the velocity and acceleration vector fields.

Abstract = {{Binder Jetting (BJ) process is an additive manufacturing process in
   which powder materials are selectively joined by binder materials.
   Products can be manufactured layer by layer directly from 3D model data.
   It is not always easy for manufacturing engineers to choose proper BJ
   process parameters to meet the end-product quality and fabrication time
   requirements. This is because the quality properties of the products
   fabricated by BJ process are significantly affected by the process
   parameters. And the relationships between process parameters and quality
   properties are very complicated. In this paper, a process model is
   developed by Backward Propagation (BP) Neural Network (NN) algorithm
   based on 16 groups of orthogonal experiment designed by Taguchi Method
   to express the relationships between 4 key process parameters and 2 key
   quality properties. Based on the modeling results, an intelligent
   parameters recommendation system is developed to predict end-product
   quality properties and printing time, and to recommend process
   parameters selection based on the process requirements. It can be used
   as a guideline for selecting the proper printing parameters in BJ to
   achieve the desired properties and help to reduce the printing time.}},

Abstract = {{In Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) the fluid-structure interaction
   between the coolant and fuel assemblies is an important phenomenon that
   is directly associated to safety and performance issues for the nuclear
   industry. Fuel assemblies are formed by bundling fuel rods, long slender
   pressurized tubes containing uranium pellets, with hollow guide and
   instrumentation tubes using a number of spacer grids for support. In
   order to correctly simulate the response of a fuel assembly under
   external excitation, an investigation of the system damping is
   necessary.
   Recent study shows that the damping may grow significantly with the
   vibration amplitude, increasing the safety factor. In order to address
   this issue, the present study has developed a tool to identify the
   vibration characteristics of non-linear mechanical systems from
   experimental forced vibration data obtained at different excitation
   levels. In particular, this project focuses on the damping
   identification. A parameter identification methodology for non-linear
   systems, based on harmonic balance method, is used to identify the
   damping governing the motion of such systems.
   The tool has been developed by using hardening non-linear responses of
   two sandwich panel and a metal plate subjected to external harmonic
   excitation. The method has been validated by comparison with the damping
   identified by the full non-linear model of the two sandwich panels. In
   the three cases, an increase of damping with the vibration amplitude is
   found and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular prostheses used for repairing and replacing damaged and
   diseased the thoracic aorta in cases of aneurysm, dissection or
   coarctation have distinctly different mechanical properties than the
   native aorta. Very little is known about the dynamic behavior of
   vascular prostheses that can cause unwanted hernodynamic effects leading
   to their failure. In this study, a Dacron reconstitution of the aorta is
   modelled as an isotropic cylindrical shell by means of nonlinear
   Novozhilov shell theory. A numerical bifurcation analysis employs a
   refined reduced order model to investigate the dynamic behavior of a
   pressurized Dacron aortic replacement conveying blood flow. A pulsatile
   time-dependent blood flow model is considered in order to study the
   effect of pressurization by applying physiological waveforms of velocity
   and pressure during the heart beating period. Stresses due to
   pressurization are evaluated and included in the model. The fluid is
   modeled as a Newtonian pulsatile flow and it is formulated using a
   hybrid model that contains the unsteady effects obtained from the linear
   potential flow theory and the pulsatile viscous effects obtained from
   the unsteady time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Geometrically
   non-linear vibration response to pulsatile flow is here presented via
   frequency-response curves and time histories. This study provides a
   fully coupled fluid structure interaction model and it allows deep
   insights in the mechanical loading condition of the aortic replacements;
   this insight has potential to aid in vascular prostheses design and
   implementation.}},

   excitation frequency in very small steps at specific force amplitudes
   controlled in a closed-loop. The experimental results are compared to

Abstract = {{Sustainable transport commonly considers either the interaction between
   built and natural environments or the interface between transportation
   and interdependent critical infrastructure. Although considering each of
   these key dimensions is a crucial task for achieving sustainable
   transport, the dimensions are infrequently considered together. When an
   integrated network design framework is proposed, two important issues
   are taken into account: (a) the aftermath of potential severe weather
   episodes on metropolitan-area infrastructure and (b) the existing
   interdependencies across transportation and fuel supply chain networks.
   Then the response of infrastructure in the face of flooding hazards is
   investigated. Framed within a multistage linear stochastic program, the
   proposed model seeks to find fueling station deployment that provides
   the transportation network with optimum random functionality when the
   network is stressed or under attack. A set of numerical experiments
   illustrates how changes to enhancement strategies at different stages of
   government affect the optimal investments in resilient design.}},

Abstract = {{Static structural engine components are typically designed for full
   lifetime operation. Efforts to reduce weight in order to improve
   performance result in structural designs associated with higher lifing
   uncertainty: Maintaining reliability levels may necessitate expensive
   manufacturing and maintenance solutions. In practice, repair techniques
   for such structures are available; however, they are not planned for
   during the design process. The objective of the research presented in
   this paper is to model and optimize component lifecycle costs with
   respect to lifing decisions, demonstrated by means of an aeroengine
   component design example. Both technical (failure) and legislative
   (certification) implications are considered. The impact of maintenance
   strategies (repair and/or replace) on lifing design decisions is
   quantified. It is shown that, under different conditions, it may not be
   prudent to design for full life but rather accept shorter life and then
   repair or replace the component. This is especially evident if
   volumetric effects on low cycle fatigue life are taken into account. It
   is possible that failure rates based on legacy engines do not translate
   necessarily to weight-optimized components. Such an analysis can play a
   significant supporting role in engine component design in a
   product-service system context.}},

Title = {{Generalized Richardson extrapolation procedures for estimating
   grid-independent numerical solutions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT \& FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{1121-1144}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present outcomes of efforts
   made over the last 20 years to extend the applicability of the
   Richardson extrapolation procedure to numerical predictions of
   multidimensional, steady and unsteady, fluid flow and heat transfer
   phenomena in regular and irregular calculation domains.
   Design/methodology/approach - Pattern-preserving grid-refinement
   strategies are proposed for mathematically rigorous generalizations of
   the Richardson extrapolation procedure for numerical predictions of
   steady fluid flow and heat transfer, using finite volume methods and
   structured multidimensional Cartesian grids; and control-volume finite
   element methods and unstructured two-dimensional planar grids,
   consisting of three-node triangular elements. Mathematically sound
   extrapolation procedures are also proposed for numerical solutions of
   unsteady and boundary-layer-type problems. The applicability of such
   procedures to numerical solutions of problems with curved boundaries and
   internal interfaces, and also those based on unstructured grids of
   general quadrilateral, tetrahedral, or hexahedral elements, is
   discussed.
   Findings - Applications to three demonstration problems, with
   discretizations in the asymptotic regime, showed the following: the
   apparent orders of accuracy were the same as those of the numerical
   methods used; and the extrapolated results, measures of error, and a
   grid convergence index, could be obtained in a smooth and
   non-oscillatory manner.
   Originality/value - Strict or approximate pattern-preserving
   grid-refinement strategies are used to propose generalized Richardson
   extrapolation procedures for estimating grid-independent numerical
   solutions. Such extrapolation procedures play an indispensable role in
   the verification and validation techniques that are employed to assess
   the accuracy of numerical predictions which are used for designing,
   optimizing, virtual prototyping, and certification of thermofluid
   systems.}},

Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},

Pages = {{527-538}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Binder jetting (BJ) process is an additive manufacturing (AM)
   process in which powder materials are selectively joined by binder
   materials. Products can be manufactured layer-by-layer directly from
   three-dimensional model data. The quality properties of the products
   fabricated by the BJ AM process are significantly affected by the
   process parameters. To improve the product quality, the optimal process
   parameters need to be identified and controlled. This research works
   with the 420 stainless steel powder material.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study focuses on four key printing
   parameters and two end-product quality properties. Sixteen groups of
   orthogonal experiment designed by the Taguchi method are conducted, and
   then the results are converted to signal-to-noise ratios and analyzed by
   analysis of variance.
   Findings - Five sets of optimal parameters are concluded and verified by
   four group confirmation tests. Finally, by taking the optimal
   parameters, the end-product quality properties are significantly
   improved.
   Originality/value - These optimal parameters can be used as a guideline
   for selecting proper printing parameters in BJ to achieve the desired
   properties and help to improve the entire BJ process ability.}},

Title = {{A survey of the design methods for additive manufacturing to improve
   functional performance}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{569-590}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the
   state-of-the-art design methods for additive manufacturing (AM)
   technologies to improve functional performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this survey, design methods for AM to
   improve functional performance are divided into two main groups. They
   are design methods for a specific objective and general design methods.
   Design methods in the first group primarily focus on the improvement of
   functional performance, while the second group also takes other
   important factors such as manufacturability and cost into consideration
   with a more general framework. Design methods in each groups are
   carefully reviewed with discussion and comparison.
   Findings - The advantages and disadvantages of different design methods
   for AM are discussed in this paper. Some general issues of existing
   methods are summarized below: most existing design methods only focus on
   a single design scale with a single function; few product-level design
   methods are available for both products' functionality and assembly; and
   some existing design methods are hard to implement for the lack of
   suitable computer-aided design software.
   Practical implications - This study is a useful source for designers to
   select an appropriate design method to take full advantage of AM.
   Originality/value - In this survey, a novel classification method is
   used to categorize existing design methods for AM. Based on this
   classification method, a comprehensive review is provided in this paper
   as an informative source for designers and researchers working in this
   field.}},

   of Transverse Flux Linear Motor}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1307-1315}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a multi-objective design optimization of the
   transverse flux linear motor with an inner mover using the shuffled frog
   leaping algorithm. The optimization target is to reduce the transverse
   flux linear motor weight while maximizing its thrust force as well as
   minimizing its detent force. The design variables of the optimization
   problem are the stator pole length, air-gap length, winding window
   width, and stator pole width, where these variables affect the motor
   characteristics. The response surface methodology was used to obtain a
   mathematical model of the motor weight, detent force, and thrust force
   in terms of the design variables. Finite-element computations were used
   for numerical experiments on the geometrical design variables to
   determine the coefficients of a second-order analytical model for the
   response surface methodology. The finite-element analysis model is
   verified with the experimental results of a scaled-down model of the
   transverse flux linear motor. The effectiveness of the shuffled frog
   leaping algorithm model is compared with that of the genetic algorithm
   model and particle swarm optimization model. With the proposed shuffled
   frog leaping algorithm technique, the weight of the initially designed
   transverse flux linear motor and its detent force is reduced and its
   thrust force is increased.}},

Abstract = {{Following the development of microfluidic systems, there has been a high
   tendency towards developing lab-on-a-chip devices for biochemical
   applications. A great deal of effort has been devoted to improve and
   advance these devices with the goal of performing complete sets of
   biochemical assays on the device and possibly developing portable
   platforms for point of care applications. Among the different
   microfluidic systems used for such a purpose, digital microfluidics
   (DMF) shows high flexibility and capability of performing multiplex and
   parallel biochemical operations, and hence, has been considered as a
   suitable candidate for lab-on-a-chip applications. In this review, we
   discuss the most recent advances in the DMF platforms, and evaluate the
   feasibility of developing multifunctional packages for performing
   complete sets of processes of biochemical assays, particularly for
   point-of-care applications. The progress in the development of DMF
   systems is reviewed from eight different aspects, including device
   fabrication, basic fluidic operations, automation, manipulation of
   biological samples, advanced operations, detection, biological
   applications, and finally, packaging and portability of the DMF devices.
   Success in developing the lab-on-achip DMF devices will be concluded
   based on the advances achieved in each of these aspects.}},

   IMPINGING ON PLANAR SMOOTH AND ROUGH SURFACES}},
Journal = {{THERMAL SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{S47-S57}},
Abstract = {{The flow and heat transfer characteristics of twin turbulent slot jets
   impinging on planar smooth and rough surfaces are examined using a
   computational fluid dynamics model. The interaction between jets lowers
   the heat transfer performance of each jet in the zone where the wall
   jets collide. A single jet performs better than the equivalent twin jet.
   The average heat transfer under twin jets which are injected alternately
   so that each one of the pair of jets behaves like a single jet, is found
   to be better than twin jets issuing simultaneously. It is proposed that
   alternating jet flows in the twin jet arrangement is a simple novel way
   to enhance thermal performance of jet pairs. Along with parametric
   studies of the key flow and geometric parameters, effects of large
   temperature differences between the jet air and the target surface being
   heated, and model roughness of the target surface are also evaluated.
   Interestingly, roughness can lower the heat transfer performance in the
   impingement zone as the fluid can get trapped in the valleys in the
   rough surface.}},

   Differences for Heat Exchanger Application}},
Journal = {{HEAT TRANSFER ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{1341-1356}},
Abstract = {{In many heat exchanger applications, working fluid inside the tubes is
   subjected to considerable temperature changes. Coiled tubes are used
   widely in heat exchanger applications due to the enhanced heat transfer
   rate caused by secondary flows. This study examines the thermal
   performance of three configurations of coiled tubes of square
   cross-section, namely, in-plane, helical, and conical coiled tubes,
   subjected to a large temperature difference between the fluid and the
   wall and compares it with that of a straight tube of identical
   cross-section area and length. The concept of figure of merit (FoM) is
   introduced to compare the heat transfer performance of the various
   configurations tested. The results indicate that FoM increases as the
   wall temperature is increased. In addition, the combination of
   temperature-induced buoyant flow and curvature-induced secondary flow
   significantly affects the flow behavior and heat transfer performance
   inside the tubes. The coil pitch in helical and conical tubes has an
   adverse effect on the heat transfer performance due to shift in vortices
   generation. The in-plane spiral tube operates at a higher wall
   temperature and lower Reynolds number, which gives rise to a higher FoM.
   The highest Nusselt number is obtained for the in-plane spiral tube at
   higher wall temperature and higher Reynolds number, which shows
   potential for practical applications.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{4912-4922}},
Abstract = {{Hierarchical laser-patterned surfaces were tested for their drag
   reduction abilities. A tertiary level of surface roughness which
   supports stable Cassie wetting was achieved on the patterned copper
   samples by laser-scanning multiple times. The laser-fabricated
   micro/nano structures sustained the shear stress in liquid flow. A
   rheometer setup was used to measure the drag reduction abilities in term
   of slip lengths on eight different samples. A considerable increase in
   slip length (111\% on a grate sample) was observed on these surfaces
   compared to the slip length predictions from the theoretical and the
   experimental models for the non-hierarchical surfaces. The increase in
   slip lengths was correlated to the secondary level of roughness observed
   on the patterned samples. The drag reduction abilities of three
   different arrangements of the surface features were also compared: posts
   in a square lattice, parallel grates, and posts in a hexagonal lattice.
   Although the latter facilitates a stable Cassie state, it nevertheless
   resulted in a lower normalized slip length compared to the other two
   arrangements at a similar solid fraction. Furthermore, we coated the
   laser-patterned surfaces with a silane to test the effect of surface
   chemistry on drag reduction. While the contact angles were surprisingly
   similar for both the non-silanized and the silanized samples, we
   observed higher slip lengths on the latter, which we were able to
   explain by measuring the respective penetration depths of the
   liquid-vapour interface between surface features.}},

Abstract = {{The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has been widely used as a model
   organism in biological studies because of its short and prolific life
   cycle, relatively simple body structure, significant genetic overlap
   with human, and facile/inexpensive cultivation. Microinjection, as an
   established and versatile tool for delivering liquid substances into
   cellular/organismal objects, plays an important role in C. elegans
   research. However, the conventional manual procedure of C. elegans
   microinjection is labor-intensive and time-consuming and thus hinders
   large-scale C. elegans studies involving microinjection of a large
   number of C. elegans on a daily basis. In this paper, we report a novel
   microfluidic device that enables, for the first time, fully automated,
   high-speed microinjection of C. elegans. The device is automatically
   regulated by on-chip pneumatic valves and allows rapid loading,
   immobilization, injection, and downstream sorting of single C. elegans.
   For demonstration, we performed microinjection experiments on 200 C.
   elegans worms and demonstrated an average injection speed of 6.6
   worm/min (average worm handling time: 9.45 s/worm) and a success rate of
   77.5\% (post-sorting success rate: 100\%), both much higher than the
   performance of manual operation (speed: 1 worm/4min and success rate:
   30\%). We conducted typical viability tests on the injected C. elegans
   and confirmed that the automated injection system does not impose
   significant adverse effect on the physiological condition of the
   injected C. elegans. We believe that the developed microfluidic device
   holds great potential to become a useful tool for facilitating
   high-throughput, large-scale worm biology research. (C) 2016 AIP

Abstract = {{A model of a hydrogen - bromine redox flow battery cathode with
   interdigitated flow channels was developed to investigate the effect of
   both the morphology of the fibrous electrode as well as the overall
   architecture of the cell. The fiber morphology was determined by the
   fiber diameter and porosity while the cell architecture was determined
   by the electrode thickness as well as the channel and rib widths. A
   comprehensive parametric study was performed looking at the effects
   these parameters had on the overall performance of the cell. A kinetic
   parameter was also varied to allow for different catalytic systems. This
   generalized the scope of the work and made it applicable for a large
   variety of systems. The importance of fiber morphology was found to be
   heavily dependent on kinetics. As expected, slow reacting systems
   performed better with smaller fibers and lower permeability while the
   opposite was true for highly kinetic systems. The width of the domain
   was the most important characteristic, in all cases the narrowest
   channel had the highest reaction rate. This was also largely true for
   the rib widths; in most cases the narrowest rib performed best. The
   effect of the electrode thickness was found to vary depending on the
   permeability and kinetics of the system. A non-dimensional group was
   proposed to represent the entire dataset and visualize the relative
   importance of each parameter. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All

   separation and blend glass transition temperatures suggested some degree
   of blend compatibility. The elastic modulus showed a negative deviation
   from the additive law of mixture. Superior biocompatibility in terms of
   fibroblast NIH 3T3 cell adhesion and proliferation, better mechanical
   properties, and a more homogeneous phase were obtained with PLCL/PLGA
   25/75 blend. Rapid degradation of PLCL phase (4-8 weeks) in PLCL/PLGA
   25/75 blend led to a porous structure, which makes it a potential

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of Sb
   (0, 0.2 and 2 wt.\%) on wetting performance of lead-free solder of near
   eutectic Sn-Cu micro-alloyed with Ni and Ge.
   Design/methodology/approach - The melting characteristic of the
   lead-free alloys was studied using differential scanning calorimetry.
   Wettability was examined using wetting balance test for two liquid
   fluxes, water based and alcohol based in two temperatures 265 degrees C
   and 277 degrees C. Also, contact angle was measured using sessile drop
   test.
   Findings - It is shown that 0.2 wt.\% Sb reduces the melting temperature
   and pasty range. Moreover, the addition of 0.2 wt.\% Sb improves wetting
   behavior for alcohol-based flux. It is also demonstrated that the effect
   of Sb on meniscus height in wetting balance test and contact angle in
   sessile drop test follows the trend of wetting performance.
   Originality/value - It is found that adding 0.2 wt.\% Sb improves the
   wettability of Ni-Ge micro-alloyed Sn-Cu solder; however, higher
   concentration of Sb does not benefit the alloy.}},

Abstract = {{A solid-state recycling route for processing aluminium alloy 7075 chips

   industrial scale comminution line to produce a broad particle size
   distribution of granulated products and powders. Upon sieving, the -140
   mesh fraction of the pulverised material was consolidated by spark
   plasma sintering into fully dense compacts, i.e. >99\%. The properties
   of the pulverised powders and compacts were compared to commercially
   available aluminium alloy 7075 powder used in industrial press-sinter
   applications. The comminution line produced powder particles which
   possessed a 7.9 +/- 0.6-nm thick native oxide layer with adhering
   exogenous contaminants, and aluminium oxide particles dispersed
   throughout the powder. The presence of the oxide layer and exogenous
   contaminants was found to be deleterious to the powder consolidation and
   mechanical properties. A flexural strength and strain and hardness of
   94.7 +/- 7.2 MPa, 2.1 +/- 0.3\% and 69.3 +/- 5.2 HV were obtained,

Abstract = {{Surface energy balance is critical to the understanding of crop
   evapotranspiration (ET) requirements and crop water stresses. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the simulation of crop growth,
   water and surface energy balance components, canopy temperature, and
   water stress under fully irrigated and deficit-irrigated corn in eastern
   Colorado using a hybrid version of the Root Zone Water Quality Model
   (RZWQM) and the Simultaneous Heat and Water model (SHAW) (RZ-SHAW). The
   field experiment was conducted in 2010 under both full and deficit
   irrigation conditions with energy balance measured using the Bowen ratio
   method. The model simulated grain yield satisfactorily, with an error of
   less than 5\%. Leaf area index, daily ET, soil water content, canopy
   temperature, and energy balance components, including net radiation
   (R-n), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H), and ground heat flux (G),
   were simulated well, with coefficients of determination (R-2) >= 0.64
   and model efficiencies (ME) >= 0.57 for both full and deficit irrigation
   fields. The RZ-SHAW model accurately predicted the responses of crop
   growth and ET to water stress, and the simulated water stress was in
   good agreement with measured elevated canopy temperature with deficit
   irrigation after silking. However, the model performance was not
   acceptable in predicting plant height for water-stressed corn, and the
   simulated increase in canopy temperature under deficit irrigation was
   about 30\% of the observed temperature increase. This study suggests
   that while the RZ-SHAW model can be used to evaluate the response of
   corn yield and water and energy balances to water stress, the simulation
   of the effects of water deficit on plant height and canopy temperature
   need further improvement.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Palladium-doped nanoscale zerovalent iron (Pd-NZVI) can induce rapid
   transformations of a variety of pollutants during in situ remediation of
   contaminated aquifers. Pd-NZVI stabilized with polymeric surface
   modifiers has shown substantially improved stability and transport
   compared to bare Pd-NZVI in model subsurface granular media such as
   clean quartz sand. The natural subsurface environment is, however, much
   more complex. For example, biofilms may coat aquifer grain surfaces and
   thus alter the transport of these reactive nanoparticles. Herein, we
   compare the transport behavior of Pd-NZVI coated with
   carboxy-methylcellulose or rhamnolipid as surface modifiers, in clean
   and biofilm-coated sand packed columns. Transport studies suggest that,
   for both types of nanoparticles tested, the particle attachment
   efficiency to the collector surface generally increases (up to 6 fold in
   NaCl and 26 fold in CaCl2) in the presence of biofilm. This result
   indicates the potential for reduced Pd-NZVI transport in a natural
   groundwater system. The retentive behavior of biofilm-coated media
   increases with particle-particle aggregation (e. g., C/C-0 similar to
   0.15 for a markedly aggregated CMC-coated Pd-NZVI in divalent salt),
   implicating physical straining as an important retention mechanism.
   Retained Pd-NZVI on biofilm-laden matrices was characterized using
   enhanced darkfield hyperspectral imaging. Assessments of biofilm
   viability imply that the retained surface-modified Pd-NZVI is non-toxic
   to the cells within the biofilm matrices (viability >95\%). Moreover,

Abstract = {{Satellite observations of the spectral properties of vegetation can
   provide insights on crop conditions and yield, and, furthermore, can
   monitor the impact of droughts. In the case of rainfed crops grown for
   self-sufficiency, a drought can result in significant human suffering,
   highlighting the need to understand how droughts affect the landscape in
   such regions. This paper uses remote sensing to assess the
   phenomenological impacts of two isolated droughts, distinguishing the
   response of different vegetation covers in semiarid developing regions
   where rainfed agriculture is common. Using the standardized
   precipitation index, one normal and two dry years were selected (2000,
   2005, and 2011, respectively). An original protocol for land use land
   cover (LULC) classification that combines climatic, topographic, and
   reflectance information from 18 Landsat ETM+ images was applied to
   subsequently distinguish drought effects in different classes through
   the selected years. Finally, two vegetation indices (normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) and vegetation condition index (VCI))
   were calculated to detect drought severity impacts over the different
   LULC classes. This approach was tested in Central Mexico and provided
   accurate information on the location and extent of areas affected by
   drought. The proposed approach can be used as a system for drought risk
   management in semi-arid developing regions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the design of vector perturbation (VP) precoding
   for multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) downlink
   transmission under quantized channel side information (CSI). In
   particular, each receiver decomposes its downlink channel vector in
   forms of channel direction information (CDI) and channel magnitude
   information (CMI) for feedback to the transmitter. The CMI contribution
   is studied in two scenarios: i) perfect CMI available to the transmitter
   and ii) only CMI statistics known at the transmitter. Under these two
   scenarios, using the quantized CDI and quantization error statistics, we
   propose a unified approach to design the VP precoders that minimize the
   mean square error (MSE) between channel input and output. Closed-form
   expressions to the precoders are then derived. Bit-error-rate (BER)
   results indicate that the proposed VP precoder designs are less
   sensitive to quantization errors, and CMI availability offers
   significant performance improvements.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{114}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH) is the main inorganic component of
   hard tissues, such as bone and dentine. HA nucleation involves a set of
   negatively charged phosphorylated proteins known as non-collagenous
   proteins (NCPs). These proteins attract Ca2+ and PO43- ions and increase
   the local supersaturation to a level required for HA precipitation.
   Polar and charged amino acids (AAs) are highly expressed in NCPs, and
   seemto be responsible for the mineralizing effect of NCPs; however, the
   individual effect of these AAs on HA mineralization is still unclear. In
   this work, we investigate the effect of a negatively charged (Glu) and
   positively charged (Arg) AA bound to carboxylated graphene oxide (CGO)
   on HA mineralization in simulated body fluids (SBF). Our results show
   that Arg induces HA precipitation faster and in larger amounts than Glu.
   We attribute this to the higher stability of the complexes formed
   between Arg and Ca2+ and PO43- ions, and also to the fact that Arg
   exposes both carboxyl and amino groups on the surface. These can
   electrostatically attract both Ca2+ and PO43- ions, thus increasing
   local supersaturation more than Glu, which exposes carboxyl groups only.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities, which affect ecosystem dynamics, pose a continuous
   challenge to individuals and communities trying to survive in arid and
   semi-arid regions. The development of a method to employ rainwater
   harvesting (RWH) in the management of agricultural drought in arid and
   semi-arid regions comprised two phases: (i) detection of agricultural
   drought in Egypt's El-Beheira governorate using a normalized difference
   vegetation index differencing technique and (ii) the delineation of RWH
   locations potentially suitable for the management of agricultural
   drought in the region using a GIS decision support system (DSS).
   Temporal vegetation cover analysis showed significant spatio-temporal
   changes that have occurred in the last 40 years: a general decrease in
   vegetation cover reflecting a trend towards ecosystem degradation,
   contrasted by a greening trend in some pockets within the region.
   Potentially suitable rainwater harvesting areas for agricultural drought
   management and attendant vegetation recovery were delineated in the
   region using DSS. The model generated a RWH map with five categories of
   suitability: excellent, good, moderate, poor and unsuitable. On average,
   10.9 \% (1104.17 km(2)) and 12 \% (1215 km(2)) of the study area was
   classified as excellent and good for RWH, respectively, while 11.7 \%
   (1185.21 km(2)), 15.4 \% (1560 km(2)) and 50 \% (5065 km(2)) of the area
   were classified as moderate, unsuitable and poor, respectively. Most of
   the areas with excellent to good suitability predominantly lie in areas
   which faced severe drought between 2010 and 2014. To successfully
   implement the drought management plan, a number of RWH sites within the
   excellent areas must be developed.}},

Abstract = {{In hydroelectric power plants, generators are essential components and,
   like all machines, generate heat due to losses. The most common way to
   evacuate this heat is by circulating a cooling fluid (generally air)
   through the generator's components. Due to the geometrical complexity,
   it is quite challenging to simulate the flow to predict the cooling in a
   generator; and in-situ measurements are costly and difficult to perform
   due to the limited access. For this reason, a 1:4 scale model of a
   hydroelectric generator was built at the research institute of
   Hydro-Quebec (IREQ). In this paper; particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   measurements of the flow in the opening of the generator scale model
   pit, in the space between the enclosure wall and the cooler exit, at the
   cooler exit, in the covers, in the air gap and in the interpole region
   are presented. Experimental aspects pertaining to the seeding of the
   flow, calibration targets, and experimental method are also discussed.
   Furthermore, a comparison of the experimental data with CFD
   (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation results using ANSYS-CFX is
   given.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT}},

Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{168-181}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a multiscale finite-element formulation for the
   second mode of zonal detached-eddy simulation. The multiscale
   formulation corrects the lack of stability of the standard Galerkin
   formulation by incorporating the effect of unresolved scales to the grid
   (resolved) scales. The stabilization terms arise naturally and are free
   of user-defined stability parameters. Validation of the method is
   accomplished via the turbulent flow over tandem cylinders. The
   boundary-layer separation, free shear-layer rollup, vortex shedding from
   the upstream cylinder, and interaction with the downstream cylinder are
   well reproduced. Good agreement with experimental measurements gives
   credence to the accuracy of zonal detached-eddy simulation in modeling
   turbulent separated flows. A comprehensive study is then conducted on
   the performance degradation of ice-contaminated airfoils. NACA 23012
   airfoil with a spanwise ice ridge and Gates Learjet Corporation-305
   airfoil with a leading-edge horn-shape glaze ice are selected for
   investigation. Appropriate spanwise domain size and sufficient grid
   density are determined to enhance the reliability of the simulations. A
   comparison of lift coefficient and flowfield variables demonstrates the
   added advantage that the zonal detached-eddy simulation model brings to
   the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. Spectral analysis and
   instantaneous visualization of turbulent structures are also highlighted
   via zonal detached-eddy simulation.}},

Title = {{Optimal Network QoS over the Internet of Vehicles for E-Health
   Applications}},
Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Wireless technologies are pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare
   applications. However, a critical issue of using wireless communications
   under a healthcare scenario is the electromagnetic interference (EMI)
   caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a
   critical malfunction of medical sensors. In consideration of EMI on
   medical sensors, we study the optimization of quality of service (QoS)
   within the whole Internet of vehicles for E-health and propose a novel
   model to optimize the QoS by allocating the transmit power of each user.
   Our results show that the optimal power control policy depends on the
   objective of optimization problems: a greedy policy is optimal to
   maximize the summation of QoS of each user, whereas a fair policy is
   optimal to maximize the product of QoS of each user. Algorithms are
   taken to derive the optimal policies, and numerical results of
   optimizing QoS are presented for both objectives and QoS constraints.}},

   electrodeposited Zn coatings}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{17360-17372}},
Abstract = {{Electrodeposited Zn coatings are used in the automotive and aerospace
   industries for the cathodic protection of high-strength steel fasteners
   and components. These coatings are polycrystalline and exhibit preferred
   orientation depending on the deposition parameters. They undergo varying
   amounts of contact stress during use and this requires an understanding
   of the effect of the crystallographic orientation of the coatings on
   their friction and wear behaviors. In this study, Zn coatings with
   different orientations were electrodeposited on low-carbon steel
   substrates by modifying the plating conditions. A reciprocating pin on a
   disk tribometer with a steel counter sphere under a constant normal load
   was used to help understand the effect of the orientation of the coating
   on the coefficient of friction and the sliding behavior of the coatings.
   Ex situ analysis of the tribo/transfer films was performed using X-ray
   diffraction, nanoindentation, Raman spectrometry, electron microscopy
   and nanoindentation techniques. The crystallographic orientation of the
   coating-tribo/transfer film was correlated with the tribological
   behavior, strain hardening, and third body formation under contact
   conditions.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{87-109}},
Abstract = {{We examine the equilibrium and stability of an elastocapillary system to
   model drying-induced structural failures. The model comprises a circular
   elastic membrane with a hole at the center that is deformed by the
   capillary pressure of simply connected and doubly connected menisci.
   Using variational and spectral methods, stability is related to the
   slope of equilibrium branches in the liquid content versus pressure
   diagram for the constrained and unconstrained problems. The
   second-variation spectra are separately determined for the membrane and
   meniscus, showing that the membrane out-of-plane spectrum and the
   in-plane spectrum at large elastocapillary numbers are both positive, so
   that only meniscus perturbations can cause instability. At small
   elastocapillary numbers, the in-plane spectrum has a negative
   eigenvalue, inducing wrinkling instabilities in thin membranes. In
   contrast, the smallest eigenvalue of the meniscus spectrum always
   changes sign at a pressure turning point where stability exchange occurs
   in the unconstrained problem. We also examine configurations in which
   the meniscus and membrane are individually stable, while the
   elastocapillary system as a whole is not; this emphasizes the connection
   between stability and the coupling of elastic and capillary forces.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{We consider estimation theory for partially observed stochastic
   dynamical systems whose state equations are given by McKean-Vlasov type
   stochastic differential equations and hence contain a measure term
   corresponding to the distribution of the solution of the state process.
   Nonlinear filtering equations are derived in this framework based upon
   the classification that the measure term is either stochastic or
   deterministic and that either the state or the measure term is
   estimated. When the measure term is deterministic the standard theory
   holds. Further, when the measure is random, the induced functions in the
   dynamics of the state become random and a similar recursion for the
   optimal filter is obtained. The joint estimation of state and the
   measure term is next considered. The extended state in this setup is
   shown to be a Banach space valued stochastic process with random
   functions in its state dynamics and a nonlinear filtering equation for
   this setup is provided. The first step of such an analysis requires an
   Ito's lemma for Banach space valued stochastic processes with the given
   dynamics. This work is motivated by state estimation problems in mean
   field game theory for systems where both major (asymptotically
   nonnegligible in population size) agents and minor (asymptotically
   negligible) agents are present.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports the investigation of the drying uniformity of a new
   drying technique called pulse-spouted microwave-freeze drying. A
   computer vision technique and mathematical statistics were used to
   evaluate the drying uniformity. The results show that low microwave
   power results in prolonged drying time (the drying time of 1W/g was 6h,
   which was longer than that for 2 and 3W/g), whereas spouting time and
   the time interval show less influence on the drying time. Analysis from
   infrared camera photos reveals that lower microwave power, longer
   spouting interval, and longer spouting time could improve the
   temperature distribution. Sample 4 (power: 2W/g, time: 3s, interval:
   300s) had the best temperature distribution uniformity.}},

Abstract = {{We study and compare two digital signal processing (DSP) approaches to
   recover the intensity on two orthogonal polarizations and the
   interpolarization phase modulation using a Stokes-vector direct
   detection receiver. We focus on higher order modulation of each of the
   three degrees of freedom allowed in Stokes-vector detection. 2 bits are
   encoded on each intensity of the two orthogonal polarizations, and 2
   bits are encoded in the phase difference between the two polarizations,
   giving a 6 bits per symbol format. In this study, we propose a novel
   three-stage DSP algorithm and we compare this new algorithm with our
   earlier two-stage algorithm using the following metrics: the
   computational complexity and the bit error rate (BER) performance. Using
   the three stage approach, waveform filtering and derotation are applied
   in series rather than in parallel as was done in the two stage
   algorithm. We show that the three-stage approach exhibits equal BER
   performance, while significantly reducing the total required number of
   real additions and real multiplications. Moreover, tracking the state of
   polarization using the proposed method is m-times more efficient, where
   m is the number of taps in the first filtering stage.}},

Abstract = {{A pore network model has been applied to a both sides of a fuel cell
   membrane electrode assembly. The model includes gas transport in the gas
   diffusion layers and catalyst layers, proton transport in the catalyst
   layers and membrane, and percolation of liquid water. This paper
   presents an iterative algorithm to simulate a steady state isothermal
   cell with a 3D pore network model for constant voltage boundary
   condition. The proposed algorithm provides a simple method to couple the
   results of the anode and the cathode sides by iteratively solving the
   uncoupled equations of the transport processes. It was found that local
   water blockages at the GDL/CL interface not only affect concentration
   polarization, but also might change ohmic polarization of the cell.
   Depending on the liquid water configuration in the porous electrodes,
   the protons generated in the anode need to travel longer paths to reach
   the active sites of the cathode; consequently, the IR loss will be
   increased in the presence of liquid water. This finding highlights the
   strength of pore network models which resolve discrete water blockages
   in the electrodes. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS. All rights

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Increased rainfall associated with climate change is becoming a common
   occurrence and can lead to a variety of geoenvironmental hazards.
   Infiltration during rainfall and deformations of a soil mass are
   coupled, and the water table can easily experience a rise during these
   events. A study of the coupling process is important to increase our
   knowledge concerning the impact of a water level rise on the
   environment. Based on the theory of seepage and flow in porous media,
   the theory of elasticity and the soil-water characteristic curve, a
   two-dimensional hydro-mechanical model for an unsaturated porous medium
   is developed and incorporated in the COMSOL Multiphysics (R) software.
   The numerical procedure is capable of considering the influences of the
   soil-water characteristic curve. The effects of varying the boundary
   conditions on the coupled unsaturated infiltration and deformation
   equations are investigated. The examples demonstrate that the coupling
   effects significantly influence the position of the groundwater levels.
   The rate of change in the water table is closely related to the coupled
   infiltration and deformation in an unsaturated porous medium.}},

Abstract = {{As an extension of earlier work, a three-dimensional numerical model has
   been developed for an industrial-scale low-head direct-chill slab
   casting process for the long freezing range aluminum alloy AA7050. The
   model has taken into account the coupled nature of the turbulent melt
   flow and the solidification heat transfer aspect of the direct-chill
   casting process. Computer simulations were performed to predict the
   velocity and temperature fields, the sump profile, the mushy thickness,
   and the shell thickness at the exit of the mold. Specifically, the
   aforementioned results were obtained for four casting speeds, varying
   from 60 to 180mm/min, for three metal-mold effective heat transfer
   boundary conditions, varying from 1.0 to 4.0kW/(m2K), and for three
   pouring temperatures of inlet melt, namely, 645, 661, and 693 degrees C.
   A stepwise change of the cooling water temperature in the mold and
   impingement and free-streaming regions, were considered to reflect the
   temperature history of the cooling water conditions in the industry. The
   importance of the present study lies in the fact that, by rolling the
   cast slabs from the direct-chill process, the obtained plates, sheets,
   strips, and foils of the aforementioned alloy are used extensively by
   the aerospace industry.}},

Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The stability of roadway roof has been a long-standing issue in
   underground coal mines and thus has received a great deal of attention
   by both researchers and practitioners over the past few decades. This
   paper presents a simple analytical model for stratified roadway roof
   stability analysis. The model treats the immediate roof stratum of the
   roadway as an elastic beam resting on Winkler-type foundation and
   subjected to uniform roof loading that is determined from the lithology
   and depth of overlying strata. The developed model calculates bending
   stresses and deflections of the roof beam. Two case studies from an
   underground coal mine are used to demonstrate the model. A model
   parametric study reveals that the coal foundation elasticity plays a key
   factor in roof deformation and potential failure. Field monitoring data
   is used to validate analytical model results, and the comparison shows a
   good agreement.}},

Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The presence of silt-size particles is believed to be one of the chief
   factors behind the sketchy behavior of transitional soils. Although some
   studies have investigated reconstituted and local silty soils on many
   fronts, the disproportionate understanding of the effect of the
   ``hybrid{''} fabric and structure has long stood against adequate
   characterization of silty soils. Supported by preliminary results, this
   study conceptually portrays a relationship between silt's fabric and
   plasticity of natural transitional soils. Close examination of scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) on a few selected silty soils demonstrates
   their transitional particulate structure. Patterns and coverage of clay
   coatings qualitatively support the noted transition in the structure and
   consistency. The use of mean size (D50-silt) and the mean weight
   diameter (MWDsilt) of the silt fraction, along with the fabric observed
   in micrographs, indicates a negative correlation between the coarseness
   of the silt-size particles and soil's consistency. These preliminary
   observations further support the importance of understanding the role of
   silt's fabric in transitional behavior.}},

Title = {{Effect of fault-slip source mechanism on seismic source parameters}},
Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fault-slip bursts in underground mines could cause devastating damage to
   mine openings. In the present study, three types of underlying
   mechanisms that could trigger fault slip are examined, namely asperity
   shear, stope extraction, and a combination thereof, with numerical
   analysis. First, a numerical model is constructed, in which a fault
   running parallel to a steeply dipping, tabular orebody is modeled.
   Static analysis is then performed, whereby stopes in the orebody are
   extracted. Based on the stress state obtained from the analysis, dynamic
   analyses are carried out to simulate fault-slip, using different
   simulation techniques representing the mechanisms of fault-slip. The
   results show that when fault-slip is induced by asperity shear, slips
   could spread over an extensive area of the fault. In contrast, the
   fault-slip area is limited to the vicinity of an extracted stope when
   fault-slip is caused by stope extraction. The results further indicate
   that asperity shear could induce strike-slip faulting. It is revealed
   that when fault-slip is caused by the combination, the magnitude of
   fault-slip significantly increases. Investigation of the slip rate shows
   that fault-slip induced by stope extraction induces slightly higher slip
   rates than that caused by asperity shear. It is also found that
   fault-slip induced by stope extraction ruptures faster along the fault
   than that induced by asperity shear. Lastly, the effect of the mining
   rate on the magnitude of fault-slip is examined. The result indicates
   that stope extraction with a low mining rate can considerably decrease
   the cumulative seismic moment of fault-slip that takes place during the
   mining sequence.}},

Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{31-47}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a new model was developed by fully incorporating the
   DRAINMOD model into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). In this
   modeling approach, surface flow is simulated using SWAT model and
   subsurface flow is estimated using the DRAINMOD model. The newly
   developed model, referred to as SWATDRAIN, has the potential to perform
   simulations of multiple scenarios such as controlled drainage,
   subsurface irrigation and wastewater treatment to determine
   cost-effective water management at the watershed scale. The model was
   evaluated for Green Belt Watershed, located in southern Ontario.
   Measured tile drainage and water table depth data from this watershed
   were used to evaluate the capability of the new model to simulate water
   balance components for this tile-drained agricultural watershed.
   Simulations were carried out over the period 1991-1993; 1991 and 1992
   data were used for model calibration and 1993 data were used for
   validation. During both calibration and validation periods, SWATDRAIN
   simulated the watershed hydrologic response, the water table depth, and
   tile flow very well. Model accuracy statistics for monthly and daily
   water table depth over the validation period were, respectively, 0.86
   and 0.70 for Coefficient of Determination, 0.11 and 2.90 for Percent
   Bias, and 0.80 and 0.67 for the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency. Model
   accuracy statistics for events, monthly and daily tile drainage over the
   validation period were, respectively, 0.86, 0.88 and 0.70 for R-2, 11.7,
   13.26 and 13.26 for Percent Bias, and 0.82, 0.86 and 0.69 for Nash
   Sutcliffe Efficiency. This clearly demonstrates that integrated DRAINMOD
   approach in SWAT provides an effective water management tool for
   tile-drained watersheds. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Geometric reconstruction of biological orthogonal plywoods}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{1184-1191}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we focus on the structural determination of biological
   orthogonal plywoods, fiber-like composite analogues of liquid
   crystalline phases, where the fibrils of the building blocks show sharp
   901 orientation jumps between fibers in adjacent domains. We present an
   original geometric and computational modelling that allows us to
   determine the fibrillary orientation in biological plywoods from
   periodic herringbone patterns commonly observed in cross-sections.
   Although herringbone patterns were long reported, the specific and
   quantitative relationships between herringbones and the orthogonal
   plywoods were absent or at best incomplete. Here we provide an efficient
   and new procedure to perform an inverse problem that connects two
   specific features of the herringbone patterns (aperture angle and
   wavelength) with the 3D morphology of the structure, whose accuracy and
   validity were ascertained through in silico simulations and also with
   real specimens ({''}Eremosphaera viridis''). This contribution extends
   significantly the better known characterization methods of 2D cross
   sections, such as the arced patterns observed in biological helicoidal
   plywoods, and with the present proposed methodology it adds another
   characterization tool for a variety of biological fibrous composites
   that form cornea-like tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric nanogenerators (NGs) based on vertically aligned InN
   nanowires (NWs) are fabricated, characterized, and evaluated. In these
   NGs, arrays of p-type and intrinsic InN NWs prepared by plasma-assisted
   molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) demonstrate similar piezoelectric
   properties. The p-type NGs show 160\% more output current and 70\% more
   output power product than the intrinsic NGs. The features driving
   performance enhancement are reduced electrostatic losses due to better
   NW array morphology, improved electromechanical energy conversion
   efficiency due to smaller NW diameters, and the higher impedance of
   intrinsic NGs due to elevated NW surface charge levels. These findings
   highlight the potential of InN based NGs as a power source for
   self-powered systems and the importance of NW morphology and surface
   state in overall NG performance.}},

Abstract = {{We propose the use of a non-coherent dual peak detection architecture
   for ultra wideband (UWB) receivers. To benchmark our proposed
   architecture, the performance of non-coherent UWB receivers based on
   single peak, dual peak, and energy detectors in the presence of noise
   and interference is analyzed and compared. Theoretical derivations are
   presented to evaluate the performance in additive white Gaussian noise
   (AWGN) channels, and simulations are run to verify these results and
   analyze the detector performance in a multipath fading environments. It
   is observed that receivers based on peak detection can perform on par or
   better than receivers based on energy detection in interference
   dominated environments (such as urban areas) in both AWGN and multi-path
   fading channels. This allows for the realization of non-coherent UWB
   receivers with simplified hardware without sacrificing performance. As
   such, the receiver would operate with increased energy efficiency,
   making it attractive for low power, low data rate transceivers such as
   those used in wireless sensor networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All

Title = {{Localization Accuracy of Distributed Inverse Solutions for Electric and

Abstract = {{Distributed inverse solutions aim to realistically reconstruct the
   origin of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) from noninvasively
   recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)
   signals. Our aim was to compare the performance of different distributed
   inverse solutions in localizing IEDs: coherent maximum entropy on the
   mean (cMEM), hierarchical Bayesian implementations of independent
   identically distributed sources (IID, minimum norm prior) and spatially
   coherent sources (COH, spatial smoothness prior). Source maxima (i.e.,
   the vertex with the maximum source amplitude) of IEDs in 14 EEG and 19
   MEG studies from 15 patients with focal epilepsy were analyzed. We
   visually compared their concordance with intracranial EEG (iEEG) based
   on 17 cortical regions of interest and their spatial dispersion around
   source maxima. Magnetic source imaging (MSI) maxima from cMEM were most
   often confirmed by iEEG (cMEM: 14/19, COH: 9/19, IID: 8/19 studies). COH
   electric source imaging (ESI) maxima co-localized best with iEEG (cMEM:
   8/14, COH: 11/14, IID: 10/14 studies). In addition, cMEM was less
   spatially spread than COH and IID for ESI and MSI (p < 0.001
   Bonferroni-corrected post hoc t test). Highest positive predictive
   values for cortical regions with IEDs in iEEG could be obtained with
   cMEM for MSI and with COH for ESI. Additional realistic EEG/MEG
   simulations confirmed our findings. Accurate spatially extended sources,
   as found in cMEM (ESI and MSI) and COH (ESI) are desirable for source
   imaging of IEDs because this might influence surgical decision. Our
   simulations suggest that COH and IID overestimate the spatial extent of
   the generators compared to cMEM.}},

Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{The need for fine grinding to liberate valuable minerals from low-grade
   ores has become a major concern due to the high energy requirements and
   low energy efficiencies of comminution processes. One method being
   studied to improve efficiencies is microwave pre-treatment. Microwaves
   can selectively heat certain minerals (absorbers) within an ore, causing
   internal stresses and forming fractures along grain boundaries.
   Microwave pretreatment of an ore containing microwave-absorbing minerals
   and microwave-transparent gangue can significantly reduce grinding
   energy. However, these improvements must not be detrimental to
   downstream processing. This work investigated the effects of microwave
   radiation on the grindability and flotability of a copper/nickel
   sulphide ore. A reduction in the Bond Work Index of 22\% was observed
   after microwave pre-treatment in a 3.0kW multimodal microwave (2.45 GHz)
   for 60 s. Although a significant reduction in the required grinding
   energy was observed, the amount of energy required to treat the sample
   is significantly higher than the corresponding Bond Work Index
   reduction, indicating that the process remains some distance from being
   economically viable. Microwave pre-treatment also showed beneficial
   effects on the flotation of the ore. Copper recovery remained constant
   while nickel recovery increased by 33.6\% after 120 s of microwave
   exposure at 0.8 kW, and by 34.4\% after a 30 s exposure at 3.0 kW.
   Higher microwave exposure also showed an increase in concentrate grade
   and flotation kinetics of both copper and nickel.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure models are needed to evaluate the chronic health effects of
   ambient ultrafine particles (<0.1 mu m) (UFPs). We developed a land use
   regression model for ambient UFPs in Toronto, Canada using mobile
   monitoring data collected during summer/winter 2010-2011. In total, 405
   road segments were included in the analysis. The final model explained
   67\% of the spatial variation in mean UFPs and included terms for the
   logarithm of distances to highways, major roads, the central business
   district, Pearson airport, and bus routes as well as variables for the
   number of on-street trees, parks, open space, and the length of bus
   routes within a 100 m buffer. There was no systematic difference between
   measured and predicted values when the model was evaluated in an
   external dataset, although the R-2 value decreased (R-2 = 50\%). This
   model will be used to evaluate the chronic health effects of UFPs using

Abstract = {{The surfaces of thin film composite (TFC) forward osmosis (FO) membranes
   were modified by in situ formation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in
   the presence and absence of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets to impart
   biocidal properties to the membranes. The abundance of oxygen-containing
   functional groups in GO makes it suitable for anchoring Ag+ ions and
   governing the size, shape, and distribution of AgNPs. The presence of GO
   resulted in the formation of smaller and uniformly distributed AgNPs as
   well as increased silver loading, higher stability, and enhanced ion
   release control. Membranes modified by both GO and Ag exhibited improved
   (98\%) bacterial inactivation when compared to that of only Ag-modified
   (80\%) or GO-modified membranes (50\%). After release of Ag ion from
   GO-Ag-modified membranes for 7 days, AgNP regeneration was conducted in
   a manner identical to the in situ Ag formation procedure. After
   regeneration, the membrane regained nearly all of its antibacterial
   properties and 75\% of its initial silver loading.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of transience in the management of hydrogeologic systems
   is often uncertain. We propose a clear framework for determining the
   likely importance of transient behavior in groundwater systems in a
   management context. The framework incorporates information about aquifer
   hydraulics, hydrological drivers, and time scale of management. It is
   widely recognized that aquifers respond on different timescales to
   hydrological change and that hydrological drivers themselves, such as
   climate, are not stationary in time. We propose that in order to assess
   whether transient behavior is likely to be of practical importance,
   three factors need to be examined simultaneously: (1) aquifer response
   time, which can be expressed in terms of the response to a step
   hydrological change (tau(step)) or periodic change (tau(cycle)); (2)
   temporal variation of the dominant hydrological drivers, such as
   dominant climatic systems in a region; (3) the management timescale and
   spatial scale of interest. Graphical tools have been developed to
   examine these factors in conjunction, and assess how important transient
   behavior is likely to be in response to particular hydrological drivers,
   and thus which drivers are most likely to induce transience in a
   specified management timeframe. The method is demonstrated using two
   case studies; a local system that responds rapidly and is managed on
   yearly to decadal timeframes and a regional system that exhibits highly
   delayed responses and was until recently being assessed as a high level
   nuclear waste repository site. Any practical groundwater resource
   problem can easily be examined using the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{We use simulations of a controller that adopts a spinal-like network
   topology for goal-oriented reaching and assess its sensitivity to the
   dynamics of internal elements that allow context-independent
   performance. Such internal elements are often referred to as inverse or
   forward models of the periphery dynamics, depending on the proposed
   controller theory. Here, the ``models{''} are used in a forward
   implementation, and we evaluate how the controller's performance would
   be affected by the nature of the model. For each point-to-point reaching
   motion experiment, we use forms of internal ``efference models{''}
   (e.g., full mathematical representations of peripheral dynamics, simple
   spindle feedback, etc.) driven by motor reafference, then compare hand
   trajectories and hand path speeds in the presence or absence of external
   perturbations. It is demonstrated that a simple velocity-based model
   reduced the effects of dynamic perturbations by as much as 66\%. In
   addition, the 2D hand trajectories varied from a biological reference by
   only 0.05 cm. Thus, the controller facilitated biological like motions
   while providing response to dynamic events which are omitted in earlier
   biomimetic controllers. This research suggests that these spinal-like
   systems are robust and tunable via gain-fields without the need of
   context dependent pre-planning.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Modelling of Fault Slip Induced by Stress Waves due to Stope
   Production Blasts}},
Journal = {{ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{165-181}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Seismic events can take place due to the interaction of stress waves
   induced by stope production blasts with faults located in close
   proximity to stopes. The occurrence of such seismic events needs to be
   controlled to ensure the safety of the mine operators and the
   underground mine workings. This paper presents the results of a dynamic
   numerical modelling study of fault slip induced by stress waves
   resulting from stope production blasts. First, the calibration of a
   numerical model having a single blast hole is performed using a charge
   weight scaling law to determine blast pressure and damping coefficient
   of the rockmass. Subsequently, a numerical model of a typical Canadian
   metal mine encompassing a fault parallel to a tabular ore deposit is
   constructed, and the simulation of stope extraction sequence is carried
   out with static analyses until the fault exhibits slip burst conditions.
   At that point, the dynamic analysis begins by applying the calibrated
   blast pressure to the stope wall in the form of velocities generated by
   the blast holes. It is shown from the results obtained from the dynamic
   analysis that the stress waves reflected on the fault create a drop of
   normal stresses acting on the fault, which produces a reduction in shear
   stresses while resulting in fault slip. The influence of blast sequences
   on the behaviour of the fault is also examined assuming several types of
   blast sequences. Comparison of the blast sequence simulation results
   indicates that performing simultaneous blasts symmetrically induces the
   same level of seismic events as separate blasts, although seismic energy
   is more rapidly released when blasts are performed symmetrically. On the
   other hand when nine blast holes are blasted simultaneously, a large
   seismic event is induced, compared to the other two blasts. It is
   concluded that the separate blasts might be employed under the adopted
   geological conditions. The developed methodology and procedure to arrive
   at an ideal blast sequence can be applied to other mines where faults
   are found in the vicinity of stopes.}},

Title = {{A combinatorial approach towards achieving an injectable,
   self-contained, phosphate-releasing scaffold for promoting
   biomineralization in critical size bone defects}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{389-397}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{An injectable, guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP)-crosslinked chitosan
   sponge was investigated as a drug delivery system (DDS) for accelerating
   biomineralization in critical size bone defects (CSBDs). Two approaches
   were examined both individually, and in combination, in order to achieve
   this goal. The first approach involved the encapsulation and release of
   Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7 (BMP-7), a powerful mineralization
   stimulant. Results confirmed that the rapid gelation of the chitosan
   sponge prompted high encapsulation of BMP-7 and provided a controlled
   release over a period of 30 days with no burst release. The second
   approach was aimed at encapsulating pyrophosphatase (PPtase) in the
   chitosan sponge to cleave pyrophosphate (PPi) - a mineralization
   inhibitor and a degradation by-product of the chitosan sponge - into
   phosphate ions (Pi). PPtase was successfully encapsulated in the
   chitosan sponge and was able to completely eliminate PPi from the media
   by cleaving them to Pi. Chitosan sponges releasing Pi into the media
   were shown to increase overall biomineralization fourfold as compared to
   controls, an amount equivalent to biomineralization caused by direct
   injection of 1 mu g of free BMP-7 to the cells. Even though the combined
   encapsulation of 1 mu g BMP-7 and PPtase in the sponges did not
   demonstrate an additional increase in biomineralization, encapsulation
   of low concentrations of BMP-7 can promote mesenchymal stem cell
   migration into the sponge after application in vivo. The findings
   suggest that the sponge-PPtase system likely allows excellent bone
   regeneration with lower concentrations of BMP-7, reducing risks and
   expense of the treatment.
   Statement of significance
   There are bone defects, known as critical size defects, which do not
   heal on their own and require a therapeutic intervention. The current
   commercially-available therapies use large quantities of growth factors,
   such as Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), which makes them expensive
   and a source for a myriad of unwanted side effects. In this manuscript
   we demonstrate, for the first time, the use of an injectable
   chitosan-based sponge that contains no inorganic components, but can
   nonetheless act as a source of phosphate ions to improve bone
   mineralization. We also demonstrate that this sponge can entrap small
   concentrations of BMP-7 and provide controlled release over time. The
   ability to release phosphate ions and low concentrations of BMP-7 makes
   this therapeutic intervention clinically-relevant, affordable, and safe.

Abstract = {{Aneurysms of the ascending thoracic aorta often require prophylactic
   surgical intervention to resect and replace the aortic wall with a
   synthetic graft to avoid the risk of dissection or rupture. The main
   criterion for surgical intervention is the size of the aneurysm, with
   elective surgery recommended with a maximal aortic diameter of 4.2-5.5
   cm depending on valve type and other patient risk factors. Although the
   risk of dissection and rupture increases with the size of aneurysm,
   different pathologies, including aortic valve phenotype and connective
   tissue disorders uniquely influence the mechanical dysfunction of the
   aortic wall. Dissection and rupture are mechanical modes of failure
   caused by an inability of the tissue to withstand local tissue stresses.
   Tensile testing of aortic tissues, therefore, has been used to reveal
   the mechanical parameters of diseased and healthy tissues to better
   characterize the mechanical function of aortic tissues in different
   patient groups. In this review, we highlight the principles and methods
   of ex vivo tensile analysis as well as the composition and structural
   properties that contribute to the mechanical behaviour of the ascending
   aorta. We also present a clinically oriented description of mechanical
   testing along with insight into the characterization of aneurysm.
   Finally, we highlight recent advances in echocardiography, computer
   tomographic angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography that have
   the potential to measure biomechanical properties noninvasively and
   therefore help select aortas at risk.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear size-dependent dynamics of a geometrically imperfect
   Timoshenko microbeam subject to an axial load is investigated
   numerically based on the modified couple stress theory. Increasing the
   compressive axial load leads to an increase in the deflection (bending)
   amplitude of the microbeam. A distributed harmonic excitation load in
   the transverse direction is then applied to the microbeam and the
   nonlinear dynamics over the new deflection is analyzed. More
   specifically, the kinetic energy of the system, the size-dependent
   strain potential energy, and the works due to the external excitations
   and damping are constructed as functions of the displacement field.
   These expressions are then inserted in Hamilton's principle, a
   variational energy technique, in order to obtain the nonlinear partial
   differential equations of motion. The Galerkin scheme is then applied to
   the resultant equations, yielding a set of second-order nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations. These equations are solved numerically
   via a direct time integration method as well as a continuation
   technique. Results are plotted in the form of deflection-axial load
   diagrams, frequency-responses, force-responses, time traces, phase-plane
   portraits, and fast Fourier transforms. The importance of taking into
   account small-size effects, through use of the modified couple stress
   theory, is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Cities in North America have been building bicycle infrastructure, in
   particular cycle tracks, with the intention of promoting urban cycling
   and improving cyclist safety. These facilities have been built and
   expanded but very little research has been done to investigate the
   safety impacts of cycle tracks, in particular at intersections, where
   cyclists interact with turning motor-vehicles. Some safety research has
   looked at injury data and most have reached the conclusion that cycle
   tracks have positive effects of cyclist safety. The objective of this
   work is to investigate the safety effects of cycle tracks at signalized
   intersections using a case-control study. For this purpose, a
   video-based method is proposed for analyzing the post-encroachment time
   as a surrogate measure of the severity of the interactions between
   cyclists and turning vehicles travelling in the same direction. Using
   the city of Montreal as the case study, a sample of intersections with
   and without cycle tracks on the right and left sides of the road were
   carefully selected accounting for intersection geometry and traffic
   volumes. More than 90 h of video were collected from 23 intersections
   and processed to obtain cyclist and motor-vehicle trajectories and
   interactions. After cyclist and motor-vehicle-interactions were defined,
   ordered logit models with random effects were developed to evaluate the
   safety effects of cycle tracks at intersections. Based on the extracted
   data from the recorded videos, it was found that intersection approaches
   with cycle tracks on the right are safer than intersection approaches
   with no cycle track. However, intersections with cycle tracks on the
   left compared to no cycle tracks seem to be significantly safer. Results
   also identify that the likelihood of a cyclist being involved in a
   dangerous interaction increases with increasing turning vehicle flow and
   decreases as the size of the cyclist group arriving at the intersection
   increases. The results highlight the important role of cycle tracks and
   the factors that increase or decrease cyclist safety. Results need
   however to be confirmed using longer periods of video data. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Agriculture generates large amount of by-products that could be used to
   produce energy and reduce the amount of fuelwood required to meet the
   daily cooking needs, especially in developing countries. Rice is a major
   crop grown in West Africa and rice husk is a by-product of the milling
   process. The goal of this study was to develop a low cost system to
   produce biomass briquettes from rice husks in the context of a rural
   village. A manual press generating a pressure of 4.2 MPa was developed
   and used. The influence of the briquette formulation (type of binder,
   binder content, water addition, and bran content) was studied. The
   binders investigated were cassava wastewater, rice dust, and okra stem
   gum. The physical properties (density, moisture content, calorific
   value, durability, and compressive strength) were tested to identify the
   briquettes with the highest quality, i.e. greatest physical integrity.
   The briquettes made with rice dust had the highest durability (91.9\%)
   and compressive strength (2.54 kN), while the briquettes made with
   cassava starch wastewater had the greatest density (441.18 kg m(-3)).
   Water added to the rice husk before densification positively influenced
   the briquette quality while bran seemed to mostly increase the density,
   but not necessarily the briquette quality. The briquette formulation did
   not significantly influence the calorific value. With a higher heating
   value of 16.08 MJ kg(-1) dry basis, rice husk briquettes represent an
   interesting alternative to fuelwood. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Two-dimensional modeling of unilateral contact-induced shaft
   precessional motions in bladed-disk/casing systems}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{90-104}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The present work targets shaft whirling motions induced by direct
   blade/casing unilateral contact occurrences in aircraft engine
   bladed-disk assemblies. These contact events are favored by increasingly
   reduced blade-tip clearances and potentially lead to harmful
   interactions that may threaten the engine structural integrity.
   A simplified 2D in-plane finite element model representative of the
   engine fan stage is built, accounting for the flexibility of the shaft
   through two linear springs attached to the disk center node and the
   structural coupling provided by the fan frame and the bearings; modeled
   by an array of linear springs. A linear stability analysis of the
   reduced-order coupled system reveals two unstable zones in a selected
   rotational speed range, emanating from the linearly predicted modal
   coincidence speeds.
   Through a time-marching strategy, two asymmetric contact initiation
   mechanisms are investigated: (1) a prescribed casing distortion and (2)
   a mass imbalance on the bladed-disk. It is shown how the 1-nodal
   diameter mode of the first modal family of the bladed-disk is dominant
   when a modal interaction arises from the transient casing distortion and
   leads to divergent regimes. The presence of the frame/bearings coupling
   induces a shift in the critical speeds detected, generally characterized
   by a backward traveling wave in the rotating frame and a forward
   traveling one in the fixed frame. Further, when a mass imbalance is the
   excitation source, the suspension modes appear to have a major role and
   a stable limit cycle is reached regardless of the coupling stiffness
   with much lower energy levels than in divergent regimes. (C) 2015

Title = {{Depressive Symptoms and Small Hippocampal Volume Accelerate the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{743-754}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have highlighted that decreased hippocampal volume, an
   early neural correlate of dementia, is commonly observed in patients
   with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, it is unclear whether
   neurodegenerative and resultant clinical trajectories are accelerated
   inMCIpatients with concomitant depressive symptoms, leading to a faster
   conversion to dementia stages than those who are not depressed. No
   longitudinal study has investigated whether depressed amnestic MCI
   (DEP+aMCI) patients show an earlier onset of progression to dementia
   than non-depressed amnestic MCI (DEP-aMCI) patients and whether
   progressive hippocampal volume reductions are related in the conversion
   process. Using data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we
   examined 2-year follow-up data from 38 DEP+aMCI patients and 38 matched
   DEP-aMCI patients and compared their ages of conversion from aMCI to AD
   and trajectories of progressive hippocampal volume changes. DEP+ and
   DEP-patients were defined as having baseline Geriatric Depression Scale
   scores of 5 or above and 0, respectively. DEP+ converters showed earlier
   ages of conversion to dementia (p = 0.009) and greater left hippocampal
   volume loss than both DEP-converters and DEP+ non-converters over the
   2-year period (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, respectively). These findings could
   not be explained by changes in total brain volume, differences in their
   clinical symptoms of dementia, daily functioning, or apolipoprotein E4
   genotypes. No difference in conversion rate to dementia or progressive
   hippocampal volume change was found between DEP+ patients and
   DEP-patients, which suggested depressive symptoms themselves may not
   lead to progression of dementia from MCI. In conclusion, there is a
   synergistic effect of depressive symptoms and smaller left hippocampal
   volume in MCI patients that accelerates conversion to dementia.}},

Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{56-61}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Recently, results from sparse approximation theory have been considered
   as a means to improve the generalization performance of kernel-based
   machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present Kernel Subspace
   Pursuit (KSP), a new method for sparse non-linear regression. KSP is a
   low-complexity method that iteratively approximates target functions in
   the least-squares sense as a linear combination of a limited number of
   elements selected from a kernel-based dictionary. Unlike other kernel
   methods, by virtue of KSP's algorithmic design, the number of KSP
   iterations needed to reach the final solution does not depend on the
   number of basis functions used nor that of elements in the dictionary.
   We experimentally show that, in many scenarios involving learning
   synthetic and real data, KSP is less complex computationally and
   outperforms other kernel methods that solve the same problem, namely,
   Kernel Matching Pursuit and Kernel Basis Pursuit. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear dynamics of an axially accelerating
   beam is examined numerically taking into account all of the
   longitudinal, transverse, and lateral displacements and inertia.
   Hamilton's principle is employed in order to derive the nonlinear
   partial differential equations governing the longitudinal, transverse,
   and lateral motions. These equations are transformed into a set of
   nonlinear ordinary differential equations by means of the Galerkin
   discretization technique. The nonlinear global dynamics of the system is
   then examined by time-integrating the discretized equations of motion.
   The results are presented in the form of bifurcation diagrams of
   Poincare maps, time histories, phase-plane portraits, Poincare sections,
   and fast Fourier transforms (FFTs).}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable water management is paramount to effective and efficient
   irrigation water management. Over decades, excessive irrigation water
   application has caused erosion, poor crop quality, water logging,
   salinity, and wastage of scarce water resources. Variable rate
   irrigation (VRI) is a recent technique that aids the application of
   irrigation water according to crop needs and soil physical and chemical
   properties. A challenge in applying VRI is the determination of
   appropriate water management zones (MZs). Two software and associated
   clustering techniques stand out as the best in determining the optimal
   number of MZs: management zone analyst (MZA), based on a fuzzy c-means
   algorithm, and regionalization with constrained clustering and
   partitioning (REDCAP), based on combinatorial graph theory. This study
   assesses the two techniques for VRI application on a 44ha field in
   southern Alberta, Canada, using electrical conductivity (EC) and land
   elevation. Wedges of 8 degrees and 24 degrees generated the same number
   of optimal MZ classifications, although the heterogeneities in the 8
   degrees wedges were greater than those for the 24 degrees wedges,
   although it seems that using 24 degrees wedges may mask soil properties,
   such as the apparent soil EC or elevation, that are critical to crop
   productivity and efficient water application; however, in terms of
   costs, in this field, 24 degrees wedges with MZA software appear to be
   the optimal solution. This study highlights the effectiveness of the two
   techniques and shows how they can be used to create or classify MZs for
   VRI. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Prediction of soil attributes using the Chinese soil spectral library
   and standardized spectra recorded at field conditions}},
Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{155}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{492-500}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (TN), and pH are essential soil
   properties for assessing the fertility of paddy soils. They can be
   measured with visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy
   effectively in the field. However, environmental factors e.g., soil
   moisture and particle size distribution affect the accuracy of
   spectroscopic measurement and successful calibration transfer between
   laboratory and field spectra. Large spectral libraries derived from
   dried and ground soil samples thus could not be used to predict soil
   properties using spectra of fresh (non-processed) samples. In this
   paper, we investigated the possibility of using the Chinese soil
   spectral library (CSSL) of dry ground soils to predict OM, TN and pH of
   paddy soils in the Yangtze River Delta using spectra of fresh
   (non-processed) soil samples measured in situ, after removing the
   influences of the environmental factors with direct standardization
   (DS). The locally weighted regression (LWR) model built on the CSSL was
   then used to predict with the DS-transferred field spectra. The CSSL
   consists of vis-NIR spectra of over 3993 samples collected local dataset
   from 19 Chinese provinces. Two hundred and twenty-five soil samples
   independent from the CSSL (local dataset) were collected from 20 target
   sites in the Yangtze River Delta, China and their spectra were measured
   in both field and laboratory conditions. Using DS, a subset of the
   corresponding field and laboratory spectra from the independent set
   (designated as the transfer set) was used to derive the DS transfer
   matrix, which characterized the differences between the field and
   laboratory spectra. The field spectra of the 225 samples were then
   transferred to match characteristics of laboratory measured spectra of
   processed soil samples. The predictions of soil properties were
   performed on the DS-transferred field spectra using a LWR model derived
   with the CSSL. Results showed that DS effectively removed the effects of
   moisture from field spectra, and led to simultaneous improvement in the
   predictions of pH, OM, and TN to an acceptable level (pH: R-2=0.611,
   root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.73 and ratio of performance to
   inter-quartile range (RPIQ) = 2.30; OM: R-2=0.641, RMSE=6.82 g kg(-1)
   and RPIQ= 1.79; TN: R-2=0.658, RMSE = 0.39 g kg(-1) and RPIQ= 1.81). We
   recommended the use of DS combined with CSSL models for the efficient
   prediction of soil pH, OM, and TN simultaneously using field scans of
   paddy soils. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   technique. The resulting films were highly uniform and transparent after
   annealing at 600 degrees C and 400 degrees C for Li4Ti5O12 and LiMn2O4,

   nm were attained and the films were characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) for surface morphology and X-ray diffraction (XRD) for
   evaluating the crystallization of the active materials. Ellipsometric
   porosimetry was used to measure the porosity of the anode material.
   Furthermore, electrochemical techniques such as cyclovoltametry and
   galvanostatic charging/discharging confirm the successful synthesis of
   electrochemically active LiMn2O4 and Li4Ti5O12 films. Single-layer
   electrodes show stable capacities at discharge rates up to 100C
   indicating the high rate capability and therefore and therefore are

Abstract = {{Uniaxial compression tests were performed at 400 degrees C and a strain
   rate of 0.3 s(-1) on samples of as-extruded AZ31 magnesium alloy. At a
   true strain of -0.1, many extension twins were detected. The
   orientations of selected twins and their host matrix grains were
   determined by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) techniques. The
   Schmid factors (SFs) and accommodation strains associated with both the
   observed and absent potential twins were calculated. Analysis of the
   data indicated that some of the selected twins obeyed a Schmid factor
   criterion and others did not. In the latter cases, it was the
   accommodation strain that controlled the formation of the non-Schmid
   twins. Potential high SF twins did not form if this would have required
   the operation of `difficult' deformation modes (i.e. prismatic or
   pyramidal slip and twinning). Their place was taken by low SF twins
   whose formation required little accommodation work. Thus it appears that
   the variant selection criteria originally derived for ambient
   temperature straining continue to apply at 400 degrees C, despite the
   much lower values of the CRSS's of the difficult deformation modes. (C)

Abstract = {{Alterations in brain structures, including progressive
   neurodegeneration, are a hallmark in patients with Alzheimer's disease
   (AD). However, pathological mechanisms, such as the accumulation of
   amyloid and the proliferation of tau, are thought to begin years, even
   decades, before the initial clinical manifestations of AD. In this
   study, we compare the brain anatomy of amnestic mild cognitive
   impairment patients (aMCI, n= 16) to healthy subjects (CS, n = 22) using
   cortical thickness, subcortical volume, and shape analysis, which we
   believe to be complimentary to volumetric measures. We were able to
   replicate ``classical{''} cortical thickness alterations in aMCI in the
   hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, insula, and inferior temporal regions.
   Additionally, aMCI showed significant thalamic and striatal shape
   differences. We observed higher global amyloid deposition in aMCI, a
   significant correlation between striatal displacement and global
   amyloid, and an inverse correlation between executive function and
   right-hemispheric thalamic displacement. In contrast, no volumetric
   differences were detected in thalamic, striatal, and hippocampal
   regions. Our results provide new evidence for early subcortical
   neuroanatomical changes in patients with aMCI, which are linked to
   cognitive abilities and amyloid deposition. Hence, shape analysis may
   aid in the identification of structural biomarkers for identifying
   individuals at highest risk of conversion to AD.}},

   amylose/amylopectin content, molecular mass (M-w), degree of
   crystallinity and surface morphology were determined. The results
   indicated that the starch crystalline changed from type A to type B, and
   the crystallinity increased upon the dielectric drying. The M-w of dried
   starch was ranged from 1.532 x 10(7) to 2.059 x 10(7) and the ratio of
   higher degree of polymerization (>150) varied from 20.57\% to 6.87\% (27
   MHz), 0\% (915 MHz) and 0\% (2450 MHz). These Mw and degree of
   polymerization variations resulted in the lower viscosity but higher
   pasting temperature of the dried starch. However, the dried starch was
   still able to gelatinize and this was observed under the SEM imagines.
   The dielectric properties and drying dynamic of dried starch showed the
   interaction with the dielectric frequency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to investigate the encapsulation of
   Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 cells with a pea protein isolate-alginate
   hydrogel matrix and to study the protective effects of such matrix on
   the bacteria during freeze-drying, storage and under harsh
   gastrointestinal conditions. The encapsulation of L. casei achieved a
   high yield of 85.69\% +/- 4.82 which indicated that the matrix and the
   encapsulation technique are compatible with the probiotic strain. During
   the freeze-drying process, the matrix did not show any protective effect
   as compared to the non-encapsulated cells. The dried capsules have been
   taken into subsequent storage tests at three temperatures (+22, +4 and
   -15 degrees C). After 84 days of storage, the encapsulated L casei
   stored at -15 degrees C showed the highest survival rate among all
   samples (59.9\% +/- 17.4). After 84 days of storage, the capsules stored
   at -15 degrees C were submitted to further survival and release tests in
   simulated gastrointestinal fluids. These dried and stored capsules
   displayed a weaker buffering effect against acidic gastric conditions as
   compared to the fresh capsules which were tested right after the
   encapsulation. However, both stored and fresh capsules showed similar
   release profiles of L. casei in simulated intestinal fluid. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The measurement of core losses in machine laminations reveals a
   fundamental difference between rotational and pulsating types.
   Rotational core losses under rotating fields decrease at high flux
   density, while pulsating losses keep increasing steadily. Experimental
   analyses of loss components P-x and P-y in x and y directions with
   rotating fields show that the loss decreases in one loss component and
   sometimes attains negative values. Tracking the evolution of hysteresis
   loops along this loss component discloses a peculiar behavior of
   magnetic hysteresis, where the loop changes its path from
   counterclockwise to clockwise within a cycle of magnetization process,
   the so called interleaved hysteresis loop. This paper highlights a
   successful procedure for modeling the interleaved hysteresis loop in the
   measurement of rotational core losses in electrical machine laminations
   using the generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) model. The efficiency of
   the proposed model is compared to Preisach model. Results and conclusion
   of this work are of importance toward building an accurate model of
   rotational core losses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Galactan-rich rhamnogalacturonan I (RG I), exhibiting promising health
   benefits, is the most abundant polysaccharide in potato pulp by-product.
   In the present study, the microwave-assisted alkaline extraction of
   galactan-rich RG I was investigated. Solid/liquid ratio was identified
   as the most significant parameter affecting linearly yield and
   galactose/rhamnose contents. Microwave power and solid/liquid ratio
   exhibited a significant adverse interactive effect on the yield.
   Galactose content of extracted polysaccharides can be modulated by
   compromising between KOH concentration and extraction time, which
   exhibited adverse interaction. Optimum conditions were identified using
   the established predicted models and consisted of treatment of potato
   cell wall at solid/liquid ratio of 2.9\% (w/v) with 1.5 M KOH under
   microwave power of 36.0W for 2.0 min. Yield of intact galactan-rich RG I
   of 21.6\% and productivity of 192.0 g/L h were achieved. The functional
   properties of RG I-rich polysaccharides were comparable or superior to
   potato galactan and oranges homogalacturonan. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{GEODERMA}},

Volume = {{261}},

Abstract = {{Soil may fail in a number of ways during tilling, depending on soil
   conditions and the type of implement. The present paper investigates
   soil structures and several soil physical and mechanical properties
   associated with different failure patterns in two agricultural soils
   (upland and paddy). The dry bulk density, soil cohesion, internal
   friction angle, and cone index decreased remarkably after brittle
   failure, while chip-forming and bending failure proved less adequate at
   modifying these parameters. In addition, the highest soil fractal
   dimensions and specific surface areas were found after brittle failure
   in both soils, while the lowest were found after bending failure.
   However, the D-m and A(specific) of paddy soil were higher than that of
   upland soil after brittle failure and cChip-forming failure patterns,
   whereas the opposite occurred after bending failure. This study suggests
   that brittle failure is the most desirable type of soil failure pattern
   to achieve appropriate tilth, which can be found at the sticky limit of
   soil. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{Gypsum precipitates as a major secondary mineral during the
   iron-arsenate coprecipitation process for the removal of arsenic from
   hydrometallurgical effluents. However, its role in the fixation of
   arsenic is still unknown. This work investigated the incorporation of
   arsenic into gypsum quantitatively during the crystallization process at
   various pHs and the initial arsenic concentrations. X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray absorption
   near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   were employed to characterize the coprecipitated solids. The results
   showed that arsenate was measurably removed from solution during gypsum
   crystallization and the removal increased with increasing pH. At lower
   pH where the system was undersaturated with respect to calcium arsenate,
   arsenate ions were incorporated into gypsum structure, whereas at higher
   pH, calcium arsenate was formed and constituted the major arsenate
   bearing species in the precipitated solids. The findings may have
   important implications for arsenic speciation and stability of the
   hydrometallurgical solid wastes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Disorder was introduced by hydrogenation of graphene, bringing

   metallic conduction. Resistive thermometry was employed to determine the
   dependence of electron temperature on applied electrical power. The
   relation between heat flow and electron temperature was found to be well
   described by a power law with an exponent beta similar to 3.7-3.9 and a
   coupling coefficient Sigma similar to 1 mW/m(2) K-beta. Our observations

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a decentralised algorithm for coordinating the
   charging of multiple plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and extend it to a
   hybrid version by including the PEV's charging strategies into the
   optimisation function. Going one step further, we also consider
   coordinated workplace charging integrating PV panels. The main focus of
   our work is to conduct a comparative study between a centralised
   benchmark algorithm, and the proposed decentralised and hybrid
   approaches from both communications and power perspectives. All
   algorithms are co-simulated over a converged fiber-wireless
   communication infrastructure of 342 residential customers. Power system
   results prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithms providing up to
   19\% peak shaving while meeting drivers' requirements. Communication
   results of the decentralised algorithm compared to a centralised

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Although resting-state functional connectivity is a commonly used
   neuroimaging paradigm, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
   Thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical circuits generate oscillations at
   different frequencies during spontaneous activity. However, it remains
   unclear how the various rhythms interact and whether their interactions
   are lamina-specific. Here we investigated intra- and inter-laminar
   spontaneous phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). We recorded local-field
   potentials using laminar probes inserted in the forelimb representation
   of rat area Si. We then computed time-series of frequency-band- and
   lamina-specific current source density (CSD), and PACs of CSD for all
   possible pairs of the classical frequency bands in the range of 1-150
   Hz. We observed both intra- and inter-laminar spontaneous PAC. Of 18
   possible combinations, 12 showed PAC, with the highest measures of
   interaction obtained for the pairs of the theta/gamma and delta/gamma
   bands. Intra- and inter-laminar PACs involving layers 2/3-5a were higher
   than those involving layer 6. Current sinks (sources) in the delta band
   were associated with increased (decreased) amplitudes of high-frequency
   signals in the beta to fast gamma bands throughout layers 2/3-6.
   Spontaneous sinks (sources) of the theta and alpha bands in layers 2/3-4
   were on average linked to dipoles completed by sources (sinks) in layer
   6, associated with high (low) amplitudes of the beta to fast-gamma bands
   in the entire cortical column. Our findings show that during spontaneous
   activity, delta, theta, and alpha oscillations are associated with
   periodic excitability, which for the theta and alpha bands is
   lamina-dependent. They further emphasize the differences between the
   function of layer 6 and that of the superficial layers, and the role of
   layer 6 in controlling activity in those layers. Our study links
   theories on the involvement of PAC in resting state functional
   connectivity with previous work that revealed lamina-specific anatomical
   thalamo-cortico-cortical connections.}},

Title = {{Reactive extrusion effects on rheological and mechanical properties of

Abstract = {{Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a biosource, biodegradable polymer, is not
   suitable for some important polymer processing operations, such as film
   blowing and blow molding, due to its low melt strength. Moreover, while
   it has high tensile modulus and strength in the solid state, it exhibits
   low ductility. The present work is an extension of our earlier effort to
   improve the processability and mechanical properties of PLA by blending
   with poly{[}(butylene succinate)-co-adipate)] (PBSA), a biodegradable
   polymer with lower glass transition temperature. We evaluate the
   influences of incorporation of an epoxy chain extender and nanoclay on
   the properties of the blend. Since earlier work was conducted in a batch
   mixer, the influence of melt processing in the twin screw extruder and
   the differences between products obtained in the extruder and the batch
   mixer are evaluated and explained. Based on earlier work, the following
   PLA/PBSA blend ratios of 90:10, 80:20 and 70:30 were selected. All the
   samples were prepared in the twin-screw extruder at two different screw
   speeds (50 and 150 rpm), to evaluate the effects of residence time and
   shear rates. The morphology and structure of the blends were examined
   using field emission scanning electron microscopy. Transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to evaluate the
   levels of intercalation and exfoliation in the nanocomposites. The chain
   extension reaction was evaluated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   spectroscopy and other techniques. Rheological properties (dynamic
   oscillatory shear and elongational viscosity measurements) and
   mechanical characteristics of the pure components, blends, and
   nanocomposites were studied and discussed in light of the composition
   and morphology of the blends and the nanocomposites. (C) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Biosorption of a ternary system containing copper, nickel and calcium
   ions was conducted to examine the ability of air-filled emulsions (AFE)
   to remove heavy metal ions from a synthetic process water. AFE is a
   novel colloidal material containing fine air bubbles encapsulated by a
   thin film of cysteine-rich protein. AFE introduces a high interfacial
   surface area between metal ions and extractant. Impact of different
   experimental conditions such as calcium ion concentration, AFE dosage
   and final solution pH on metal ion uptake was explored. Calcium ions
   exhibited an adverse effect on copper removal, which reduced by 70\% due
   to both higher affinities of active binding sites for calcium ion
   compared to that of copper and nickel ions and bridging flocculation of
   microbubbles occurred in the solution. The results acquired from
   potentiometric titration showed the presence of three functional groups
   on the surface of bubbles (carboxylic, thiol and amine groups), the
   carboxylic group being the most abundant. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We evaluated the role of soil aggregate pore size on biodegradation of
   essentially insoluble petroleum hydrocarbons that are biodegraded
   primarily at the oil-water interface. The size and spatial distribution
   of pores in aggregates sampled from biodegradation experiments of a
   clayey, aggregated, hydrocarbon-contaminated soil with relatively high
   bioremediation end point were characterized by image analyses of X-ray
   micro-CT scans and N-2 adsorption. To determine the bioaccessible pore
   sizes, we performed separate experiments to assess the ability of
   hydrocarbon degrading bacteria isolated from the soil to pass through
   membranes with specific sized pores and to access hexadecane (model
   insoluble hydrocarbon). Hexadecane biodegradation occurred only when
   pores were 5 mu m or larger, and did not occur when pores were 3 mu m
   and smaller. In clayey aggregates, similar to 25\% of the aggregate
   volume was attributed to pores larger than 4 mu m, which was comparable
   to that in aggregates from a sandy, hydrocarbon-contaminated soil
   (similar to 23\%) scanned for comparison. The ratio of volumes of
   inaccessible pores (<4 mu m) to bioaccessible pores (>4 mu m) in the
   clayey aggregates was 0.32, whereas in the sandy aggregates it was
   approximately 10 times lower. The role of soil microstructure on
   attainable bioremediation end points could be qualitatively assessed in
   various soils by the aggregate characterization approach outlined
   herein.}},

Abstract = {{An advanced digital backpropagation (ADBP) algorithm is proposed to
   compensate fiber nonlinearities in subcarrier-multiplexing (SCM)
   systems. We derive the analytical expression and describe the
   implementation of the ADBP. In addition, the computational complexity of
   the ADBP as well as the conventional low-pass-filter-assisted DBP (LDBP)
   is analyzed and compared. In a 34.94 Gbaud/s single channel SCM
   transmission experiment, we demonstrate that the proposed ADBP with only
   two steps (40 spans/step for QPSK at 6400 km and 16 spans/step for 16
   QAM at 2560 km) has a comparable performance to the LDBP algorithm with
   40 steps (2 spans/step) for QPSK and 8 steps (4 spans/step) for 16 QAM,
   respectively. Moreover, compared to single carrier (SC) systems using
   only linear compensation (LC), the ADBP algorithm with 40 spans/step for
   QPSK and 16 spans/step for 16 QAM can extend the maximum reach by 49.7\%
   and 27.3\% for the two formats, respectively. The contribution to the
   reach extension consists of 19.7\% and 23.6\% which are attributable to
   the nonlinear compensation algorithm when compared to SCM systems using
   LC for QPSK and 16 QAM, respectively. The remainder of the improvements
   is attributable to the use of the SCM scheme. Finally, simulations of 60
   Gbaud/s systems show additional improvements using the ADBP schemes
   compared to the LDBP schemes, indicating the benefits of ADBP in future
   high capacity optical transmission systems.}},

Abstract = {{It is becoming widely recognized that our society must transition to
   low-carbon energy systems to combat global climate change, and renewable
   energy sources are needed to provide energy security in a world with
   limited fossil-fuel resources. While many clean power-generation
   solutions have been proposed and are being developed, our ability to
   transition to a low-carbon society is prevented by the present lack of
   clean and renewable energy carriers that can replace the crucial roles
   that fossil fuels play, due to their abundance, convenience and
   performance, in global energy trade and transportation. Any future
   low-carbon energy carriers that aim to displace or supplement fossil
   fuels must have high energy densities for convenient trade and storage,
   and should be consumable within efficient high-power-density engines for
   transportation, heavy machinery, and other off-grid energy applications.
   Hydrogen and batteries have been widely studied but they are not
   suitable for use as international energy-trading commodities and they
   cannot provide the energy density and safety demanded by society. Metal
   fuels, produced using low-carbon recycling systems powered by clean
   primary energy, such as solar and wind, promise energy densities that
   are competitive to fossil fuels with low, or even negative, net carbon
   dioxide emissions. To date, however, few practical high-power-density
   end-use devices for generating heat or power from metal fuels have been
   proposed.
   This paper proposes a novel concept for power generation in which metal
   fuels are burned with air in a combustor to provide clean, high-grade
   heat. The metal-fuel combustion heat can be used directly for industrial
   or residential heating and can also power external-combustion engines,
   operating on the Rankine or Stirling cycles, or thermo-electric
   generators over a wide range of power levels. A design concept is
   proposed for a metal-fuelled combustor that is based upon extensive
   experimental and theoretical studies of stabilized and propagating metal
   flames performed at McGill University. This paper also reviews the
   fundamental and applied aspects of metal-fuel combustion in order to
   provide the framework needed to assess any potential metal engine
   technologies. The energy and power densities of the proposed
   metal-fuelled zero-carbon heat engines are predicted to be close to
   current fossil-fuelled internal-combustion engines, making them an
   attractive technology for a future low-carbon society. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A special purpose method is presented for the static stress analysis of
   a composite bonded/bolted single-lap joint. The proposed formulation
   takes into account nonlinear adhesive constitutive behavior, contact,
   bolt-hole clearance and bolt clamp-up. Good computational efficiency is
   achieved through use of efficient kinematic models to represent the
   various joint components. The model solution is based on the principle
   of virtual work, with meshfree Radial Point Interpolating Functions used
   to approximate the unknown field functions. In order to predict joint
   failure, the maximum strain criterion and point stress criterion are
   proposed for use with the model. The model capability is validated by
   comparison with more detailed finite element analysis and experimental
   measurements. Finally, a case study comparing the stresses and strengths
   of a set of bonded, bolted and bonded/bolted joints is also presented.

Abstract = {{A novel photoreceiver architecture enabling parallel processing in the
   electronic domain of a high-speed optical signal is demonstrated. This
   allows the electronics to operate at significantly lower frequency than
   the optical signal and hence reduce power consumption and the impact of
   parasitics. The photoreceiver performs optical time sampling with four
   integrated SiGe photodetectors connected in series by waveguide delay
   lines. Four variations of the optical time sampling receiver are
   designed and demonstrated which differ by the data rate (10 Gb/s and 20
   Gb/s) and silicon delay waveguide loss (2.5 dB/cm and 0.2 dB/cm). The
   bit error rate performance of the photodetectors in the receiver was
   measured individually and reached a performance below 1x10(-10) at an
   input optical power between 4.8 and 6.3 dBm through an off-chip 50 Omega
   load at the output. After O/E conversion, the electrical signal (one
   segment of 2(15)-1 PRBS data) from each of the photodetector is
   processed without errors at a quarter of the bit rate, leading to an
   overall more power efficient receiver front-end. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel sub-band multiplexed
   data architecture for chromatic dispersion (CD) mitigation. We have
   demonstrated 32 GBaud multi-sub-band (MSB) dual-polarization (DP) 16QAM

   bandwidth is divided into multiple narrow-bandwidth sub-bands, each
   operating at a lower baud rate. Within each sub-band bandwidth, the CD
   frequency response can be approximated as a linear-phase band-pass
   filter, which can be considered as an analog delay that does not require
   compensation. Therefore, the resulting receiver digital signal
   processing (DSP) is simplified due to the removal of the CD compensation
   equalizer. In addition, this leads to efficient parallelization of DSP
   tasks by deploying multiple independent sub-band processors running at a
   lower clock rate. The proposed system reduces receiver computational
   complexity and offers 1 dB higher Kerr-nonlinearity tolerance and 2\%
   extended transmission reach in comparison to the conventional single

Title = {{Growing multiplex networks with arbitrary number of layers}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the problem of growing multiplex networks.
   Currently, the results on the joint degree distribution of growing
   multiplex networks present in the literature pertain to the case of two
   layers and are confined to the special case of homogeneous growth and
   are limited to the state state (that is, the limit of infinite size). In
   the present paper, we first obtain closed-form solutions for the joint
   degree distribution of heterogeneously growing multiplex networks with
   arbitrary number of layers in the steady state. Heterogeneous growth
   means that each incoming node establishes different numbers of links in
   different layers. We consider both uniform and preferential growth. We
   then extend the analysis of the uniform growth mechanism to arbitrary
   times. We obtain a closed-form solution for the time-dependent joint
   degree distribution of a growing multiplex network with arbitrary
   initial conditions. Throughout, theoretical findings are corroborated
   with Monte Carlo simulations. The results shed light on the effects of
   the initial network on the transient dynamics of growing multiplex
   networks and takes a step towards characterizing the temporal variations
   of the connectivity of growing multiplex networks, as well as predicting
   their future structural properties.}},

Abstract = {{Gel electrophoresis of spherical nanoparticles (NPs) is studied using an
   electrokinetic model that couples the ion conservation equations to the
   Poisson and fluid momentum equations, thus including the so-called
   polarization and relaxation processes. This model is therefore the
   charged gel electrophoresis analogue of the well-known O'Brien and White
   solution of the standard electrokinetic model for free-solution
   electrophoresis. Results are provided for the small NPs (size around 10
   nm) to which gel electrophoresis is relevant, because particles must be
   small enough to permeate the gel: these include the particle drag
   coefficient (or Brownian diffusivity), which is subject to hydrodynamic
   screening and electroviscous effects, and the electrophoretic mobility,
   which is subject to nonlinear electrostatic and charge polarization
   influences. Also addressed are the influences of charge-regulating gels
   and the accompanying particle-induced immobile charge-density
   perturbations. Ion-concentration perturbations attenuate the
   electrophoretic mobility and enhance the drag coefficient according to
   the particle charge and the mobility of the most abundant counterion.
   However, dynamic regulation of the hydrogel charge-termed the secondary
   immobile charge-density perturbation-has a negligible influence on the
   particle mobility, and may therefore be neglected for most practical
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the potential for new product design possibilities and the
   reduction of environmental impacts, Additive Manufacturing (AM)
   processes are considered to possess significant advantages for
   automotive, aerospace and medical equipment industries. One of the
   commercial AM techniques is Binder-jetting (BJ). This technique can be
   used to process a variety of materials including stainless steel,
   ceramic, polymer and glass. However, there is very limited research
   about this AM technology on energy consumption aspect. This paper
   presents a method to build an energy consumption model for printing
   stage of BJ process. Mathematical analyses are performed to find out the
   correlation between the energy consumption and geometry of the
   manufactured part. Based on the analyses, total energy consumption is
   calculated as a function of part geometry and printing parameters.
   Finally, test printing is performed to check the accuracy of the model.
   This process model provides a tool to optimise part geometry design with

Abstract = {{While there is growing application of generalized ordered outcome model
   variants (widely known as Generalized Ordered Logit (GOL) model and
   Partial Proportional Odds Logit (PPO) model) in crash injury severity
   analysis, there are several aspects of these approaches that are not
   well documented in extant safety literature. The current research note
   presents the relationship between these two variants of generalized
   ordered outcome models and elaborates on model interpretation issues.
   While these variants arise from different mathematical approaches
   employed to enhance the traditional ordered outcome model, we establish
   that these are mathematically identical. We also discuss how one can

   discussing the computational difficulties that may arise in estimating

Abstract = {{Contaminated soils are subject to diurnal and seasonal temperature
   variations during on-site ex-situ bioremediation processes. We assessed
   how diurnal temperature variations similar to that in summer at the site
   from which petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil was collected affect
   the soil microbial community and the extent of biodegradation of
   petroleum hydrocarbons compared with constant temperature regimes.
   Microbial community analyses for 16S rRNA and alkB genes by
   pyrosequencing indicated that the microbial community for soils
   incubated under diurnal temperature variation from 5 degrees C to 15
   degrees C (VART5-15) evolved similarly to that for soils incubated at
   constant temperature of 15 degrees C (CST15). In contrast, under a
   constant temperature of 5 degrees C (CST5), the community evolved
   significantly different. The extent of biodegradation of C10-C16
   hydrocarbons in the VART5-15 systems was 48\%, comparable with the 41\%
   biodegradation in CST15 systems, but significantly higher than CST5
   systems at 11\%. The enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria was observed in
   the alkB gene-harbouring communities in VART5-15 and CST15 but not in
   CST5 systems. However, the Actinobacteria was abundant at all
   temperature regimes. The results suggest that changes in microbial
   community composition as a result of diurnal temperature variations can
   significantly influence petroleum hydrocarbon bioremediation performance
   in cold regions.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of global statistics shows a substantial increase in flood
   damage over the past few decades. Moreover, it is expected that flood
   risk will continue to rise due to the combined effect of increasing
   numbers of people and economic assets in risk-prone areas and the
   effects of climate change. In order to mitigate the impact of natural
   hazards on European economies and societies, improved risk assessment,
   and management needs to be pursued. With the recent transition to a more
   risk-based approach in European flood management policy, flood analysis
   models have become an important part of flood risk management (FRM). In
   this context, free and open-source (FOSS) geospatial models provide
   better and more complete information to stakeholders regarding their
   compliance with the Flood Directive (2007/60/EC) for effective and
   collaborative FRM. A geospatial model is an essential tool to address
   the European challenge for comprehensive and sustainable FRM because it
   allows for the use of integrated social and economic quantitative risk
   outcomes in a spatio-temporal domain. Moreover, a FOSS model can support
   governance processes using an interactive, transparent and collaborative
   approach, providing a meaningful experience that both promotes learning
   and generates knowledge through a process of guided discovery regarding
   flood risk management. This article aims to organize the available
   knowledge and characteristics of the methods available to give
   operational recommendations and principles that can support authorities,
   local entities, and the stakeholders involved in decision-making with
   regard to flood risk management in their compliance with the Floods
   Directive (2007/60/EC).}},

Abstract = {{Effluents from wastewater treatment plants contain a mixture of
   estrogens (MIX: 17 beta-estradiol: E2, estrone: E1, estriol: E3 and 17
   alpha-ethinylestradiol EE2). High doses of estrogens have been shown to
   negatively impact fetal testicular development, but the impact of low
   doses of estrogens in mixture have yet to be elucidated. Using an organ
   culture system in which embryonic 15.5 day-old rat testes were grown ex
   vivo, we showed that exposure to the MIX at environmentally relevant
   concentrations reduces testis growth. No effect was observed on
   testosterone secretion, but we quantified a significant decrease in the
   number of Sertoli cells and gonocytes because of higher rates of
   apoptosis. As ozone (O-3) can be used as a disinfectant during
   wastewater treatment, we confirmed by HPLC-MS analysis that it removes
   the four parent compounds. Interestingly, the negative effects of the
   MIX were not observed when testes were exposed to the MIX treated with
   O-3. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was used
   to investigate initial adhesion and subsequent biofilm growth of
   wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and a pill-deficient (Delta pilA)
   mutant PAO1 strain. Clean, sterilized, silica-coated QCM-D crystals were
   pre-coated with lysogeny broth (LB), seeded with a PAO1 strain and
   allowed to grow for 20 h at 37 degrees C in fresh LB injected at 100 mu
   L/min. QCM-D signals obtained for the wild-type PAO1 strain during the
   seeding period depict a large positive frequency shift that returns to
   baseline after similar to 20 min that is absent in the Delta pilA
   mutants, suggesting a dynamic pill-mediated attachment event for the
   wild-type PAO1 strain. During the subsequent growth period, significant
   and characteristic differences in the acquired QCM-D signals were
   observed between the wild-type and the Delta pilA mutant. Confocal laser
   scanning microscopy (CLSM) of the biofilm on the crystal surface showed
   that these differences could not be explained by differences in the
   extent of biofilm growth alone. When interpreted according to a coupled
   resonance model, the QCM-D observations suggest that pili are essential
   for coupling the developing biomass to the sensor surface. Total
   internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) supports the
   hypothesis that the characteristic QCM-D signal is indicative of a
   dynamic attachment event, mediated by pill cell surface appendages
   pulling the wild-type PAO1 closer to the surface during the seeding
   period. We show that QCM-D offers direct, non-disruptive, in situ
   measurements of biofilm-substrate attachment. This technique has the
   potential to improve the current understanding of biofilm formation
   phenomena. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the design, fabrication and testing of a novel integrated
   tri-axial capacitive accelerometer with low cross-axis sensitivity. The
   accelerometer is fabricated in MEMS Integrated Design for Inertial
   Sensors (MIDIS), a process recently introduced by Teledyne DALSA
   Semiconductor Inc. (TDSI). The MIDIS process is based on high aspect
   ratio bulk micromachining of single-crystal silicon wafer that is vacuum
   encapsulated between two other silicon wafers. The fabrication process
   includes Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) with sealed anchors for compact
   flip chip integration with microelectronic signal processing circuitry.
   The proposed accelerometer is designed to provide simultaneous detection
   of the input accelerations along the 3 principle axes enabling high-g
   measurement up to +/- 50g. The integrated structure design uses
   decoupled frames supported by strategically designed springs and employs
   capacitive compensators for the purpose of achieving low cross-axis
   sensitivity. The capacitive transduction is based on differential
   measurement along X- and Y-axis and absolute measurement along the
   Z-axis. The initial measured capacitances are 2.18 pF, 2.4 pF and 1.14
   pF along X, Y and Z-axis, respectively. The dynamic specifications of
   the accelerometer are characterized by its lowest-order operating mode
   at 4 kHz. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, on-chip trace generation has been recognized as a
   solution to the debugging of increasingly complex software. An execution
   trace can be seen as the most fundamentally useful type of trace,
   allowing the execution path of software to be determined post hoc.
   However, the bandwidth required to output such a trace can be excessive.
   Our architecture-aware trace compression (AATC) scheme adds an on-chip
   branch predictor and branch target buffer to reduce the volume of
   execution trace data in real time through on-chip compression. Novel
   redundancy reduction strategies are employed, most notably in exploiting
   the widespread use of linked branches and the compiler-driven movement
   of return addresses between link register, stack, and program counter.
   In doing so, the volume of branch target addresses is reduced by 52\%,
   whereas other algorithmic improvements further decrease trace volume. An
   analysis of spatial and temporal redundancy in the trace stream allows a
   comparison of encoding strategies to be made for systematically
   increasing compression performance. A combination of differential,
   Fibonacci, VarLen, and Move-to-Front encodings are chosen to produce two
   compressor variants: a performance-focused xAATC that encodes 56.5
   instructions/bit using 24,133 gates and an area-efficient fAATC that
   encodes 48.1 instructions/bit using only 9,854 gates.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a promising technique that converts
   wet biomass into a coal-like material and has a wide application to the
   fields of energy, material science, and nanotechnology. HTC has been
   primarily used to treat a limited number of feedstocks, mainly
   lignocellulosic biomass such as wood. Recently, the HTC process has been
   utilized to treat high-moisture-containing complex waste streams, a
   mixture of lignocellulosic: and nonlignocellulosic biomass, such as
   sewage and municipal waste. However, there is limited knowledge on the
   effectiveness of HTC on purely nonlignocellulosic industrial waste like
   seafood waste. Processing of seafood generates enormous amounts of waste
   in the form of solid residues and liquid effluents. Currently there is a
   demand for attractive seafood waste utilization strategies that minimize
   environmental pollution while recovering products that are of commercial
   interest to the industry. In this study, we have devised one such
   strategy where seafood waste is pretreated by enzymatic hydrolysis for
   subsequent HTC to produce hydrochar and biocrude liquor. Enzyme
   hydrolysis conditions including enzyme concentration; incubation time,
   and enzyme ratios were carefully optimized for maximal hydrolysis of
   seafood waste. By using an enzyme cocktail-of Viscozyme, Lipase, and
   Protease, it was found that an enzyme ratio of 1:1:1 (w/w/w), and an
   enzyme concentration of 10-20\% with a treatment time of 16 h, resulted
   in maximal hydrolysis of fish and shrimp -waste. Subsequently, hydrochar
   and biocrude liquor were generated from hydrolyzed fish and shrimp waste
   by microwave hydrothermal carbonization (MHTC) using a high-pressure
   Mini WAVE Digestion Module (SCP Science, Canada) with quartz vessels at
   conditions of 150 degrees C for a 1 h reaction time. The results of this
   study show for the first time that MHTC can be successfully employed to
   produce valuable products from pure nonlignocellulosic waste like
   seafood waste. This would pave the way for effective utilization of
   other moisture-rich nonlignocellulosic industrial wastes.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative relaying is an effective method of increasing the range and
   reliability of wireless networks, and several relaying strategies have
   been adopted in major wireless standards. Recently, cooperative relaying
   has also been considered in the context of PHY security, which is a new
   security paradigm to supplement traditional cryptographic schemes that
   usually handle security at the upper layers. In wireless PHY security,
   relay nodes can be used to exploit the physical layer properties of
   wireless channels in order to support a secured transmission from a
   source to a destination in the presence of one or more eavesdroppers.
   While some breakthroughs have been made in this emerging research area,
   to date, the problem of how to effectively adopt advanced relaying
   protocols to enhance PHY security is still far from being fully
   understood. In this article, we present a comprehensive summary of
   current state-of-the-art PHY security concepts in wireless relay
   networks. A case study is then provided to quantify the benefits of
   power allocation and relay location for enhanced security. We finally
   outline important future research directions in relaying topologies,
   full-duplex relaying, and cross-layer design that can ignite new
   interests and ideas on the topic.}},

Abstract = {{Angiogenesis is tightly controlled by a number of signalling pathways.
   Although our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in
   angiogenesis has rapidly increased, the role that biomechanical signals
   play in this process is understudied. We recently developed a technique
   to simultaneously analyse flow dynamics and vascular remodelling by
   time-lapse microscopy in the capillary plexus of avian embryos and used
   this to study the hemodynamic environment present during angiogenic
   sprouting. We found that sprouts always form from a vessel at lower
   pressure towards a vessel at higher pressure, and that sprouts form at
   the location of a shear stress minimum, but avoid locations where two
   blood streams merge even if this point is at a lower level of shear
   stress than the sprouting location. Using these parameters, we were able
   to successfully predict sprout location in quail embryos. We also found
   that the pressure difference between two vessels is permissive to
   elongation, and that sprouts will either change direction or regress if
   the pressure difference becomes negative. Furthermore, the sprout
   elongation rate is proportional to the pressure difference between the
   two vessels. Our results show that flow dynamics are predictive of the
   location of sprout formation in perfused vascular networks and that
   pressure differences across the interstitium can guide sprout
   elongation.}},

Abstract = {{Normal vascular development requires blood flow. Time-lapse imaging
   techniques have revolutionised our understanding of developmental
   biology, but measuring changes in blood flow dynamics has met with
   limited success. Ultrasound biomicroscopy and optical coherence
   tomography can concurrently image vascular structure and blood flow
   velocity, but these techniques lack the resolution to accurately
   calculate fluid forces such as shear stress. This is important because
   hemodynamic forces are biologically active and induce changes in the
   expression of genes important for vascular development. Regional
   variations in shear stress, rather than the overall level, control
   processes such as vessel enlargement and regression during vascular
   remodelling. We present a technique to concurrently visualise vascular
   remodelling and blood flow dynamics. We use an avian embryonic model and
   inject an endothelial-specific dye and fluorescent microspheres. The
   motion of the microspheres is captured with a high-speed camera and the
   velocity of the blood flow in and out of the region of interest is
   quantified by micro-particle image velocitymetry (mu PIV). The vessel
   geometry and flow are used to numerically solve the flow physics with
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Using this technique, we can analyse
   changes in shear stress, pressure drops and blood flow velocities over a
   period of 10 to 16 h. We apply this to study the relationship between
   shear stress and chronic changes in vessel diameter during embryonic
   development, both in normal development and after TGF beta stimulation.
   This technique allows us to study the interaction of biomolecular and
   biomechanical signals during vascular remodelling using an in vivo
   developmental model.}},

Abstract = {{Targeted therapies and the consequent adoption of ``personalized{''}
   oncology have achieved notable successes in some cancers; however,
   significant problems remain with this approach. Many targeted therapies
   are highly toxic, costs are extremely high, and most patients experience
   relapse after a few disease-free months. Relapses arise from genetic
   heterogeneity in tumors, which harbor therapy-resistant immortalized
   cells that have adopted alternate and compensatory pathways (i.e.,
   pathways that are not reliant upon the same mechanisms as those which
   have been targeted). To address these limitations, an international task
   force of 180 scientists was assembled to explore the concept of a
   low-toxicity ``broadspectrum{''} therapeutic approach that could
   simultaneously target many key pathways and mechanisms. Using cancer
   hallmark phenotypes and the tumor microenvironment to account for the
   various aspects of relevant cancer biology, interdisciplinary teams
   reviewed each hallmark area and nominated a wide range of high-priority
   targets (74 in total) that could be modified to improve patient
   outcomes. For these targets, corresponding low-toxicity therapeutic
   approaches were then suggested, many of which were phytochemicals.
   Proposed actions on each target and all of the approaches were further
   reviewed for known effects on other hallmark areas and the tumor
   microenvironment Potential contrary or procarcinogenic effects were
   found for 3.9\% of the relationships between targets and hallmarks, and
   mixed evidence of complementary and contrary relationships was found for
   7.1\%. Approximately 67\% of the relationships revealed potentially
   complementary effects, and the remainder had no known relationship.
   Among the approaches, 1.1\% had contrary, 2.8\% had mixed and 62.1\% had
   complementary relationships. These results suggest that a broad-spectrum
   approach should be feasible from a safety standpoint. This novel
   approach has potential to be relatively inexpensive, it should help us
   address stages and types of cancer that lack conventional treatment, and
   it may reduce relapse risks. A proposed agenda for future research is
   offered. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering algorithms strive to organize data into meaningful groups in
   an unsupervised fashion. For some datasets, these algorithms can provide
   important insights into the structure of the data and the relationships
   between the constituent items. Clustering analysis is applied in
   numerous fields, e.g., biology, economics, and computer vision. If the
   structure of the data changes over time, we need models and algorithms
   that can capture the time-varying characteristics and permit evolution
   of the clustering. Additional complications arise when we do not have
   the entire dataset but instead receive elements one-by-one. In the case
   of data streams, we would like to process the data online, sequentially
   maintaining an up-to-date clustering. In this paper, we focus on
   Bayesian topic. models; although these were originally derived for
   processing collections of documents, they can be adapted to many kinds
   of data. The main purpose of the paper is to provide a tutorial
   description and survey of dynamic topic models that are suitable for
   online clustering algorithms, but we illustrate the modeling approach by
   introducing a novel algorithm that addresses the challenges of
   time-dependent clustering of streaming data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The dynamic performance of the PEM fuel cell is one of the key factors
   for successful operation of a fuel cell-powered vehicle. Maintaining
   fast time response while keeping stable and high stack performance is of
   importance, especially during acceleration and deceleration. In this
   paper, we evaluate the transient response of a PEM fuel cell stack with
   a dead-end anode during segments of a legislated European driving cycle
   together with the effect of purging factors. The PEM fuel cell stack
   comprises of 24 cells with a 300 cm(2) active catalyst area and operates
   at a low hydrogen and air pressure. Humidified air is supplied to the
   cathode side and the dry hydrogen is fed to the anode. The liquid
   coolant is circulated to the stack and the radiator to maintain the
   thermal envelope throughout the stack. The stack performance
   deterioration over time is prevented by utilizing the purging, which
   removes the accumulated water and impurities. The effect of purging
   period, purging duration, coolant flow rate and cathode stoichiometry
   are examined with regard to the fuel cell's transient performance during
   the driving cycle. The results show that a low purging duration may
   avoid the undesired deceleration at a high current, and a high purging
   period may sustain a better performance over time. Moreover, the coolant
   flow rate is found to be an important parameter, which affects the stack
   temperature-time response of the cooling control and the stack
   performance, especially at high operating currents. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Teleost fish scales amongst the toughest collagenous materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{95-107}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fish scales from modern teleost fish are high-performance materials made
   of cross-plies of collagen type I fibrils reinforced with
   hydroxyapatite. Recent studies on this material have demonstrated the
   remarkable performance of this material in tension and against sharp
   puncture. Although it is known that teleost fish scales are extremely
   tough, actual measurements of fracture toughness have so far not been
   reported because it is simply not possible to propagate a crack in this
   material using standard fracture testing configurations. Here we present
   a new fracture test setup where the scale is clamped between two pairs
   of miniature steel plates. The plates transmit the load uniformly,
   prevent warping of the scale and ensure a controlled crack propagation.
   We report a toughness of 15 to 18kJ m(-2) (depending on the direction of
   crack propagation), which confirms teleost fish scales as one of the
   toughest biological material known. We also tested the individual bony
   layers, which we found was about four times less tough than the collagen
   layer because of its higher mineralization. The mechanical response of
   the scales also depends on the cohesion between fibrils and plies.
   Delamination tests show that the interface between the collagen fibrils
   is three orders of magnitude weaker than the scale, which explains the
   massive delaminadon and defibrillation observed experimentally. Finally,
   simple fracture mechanics models showed that process zone toughening is
   the principal source of toughening for the scales, followed by bridging
   by delaminated fibrils. These findings can guide the design of cross-ply
   composites and engineering textiles for high-end applications. This
   study also hints on the fracture mechanics and performance of
   collagenous materials with similar microstructures: fish skin, lamellar
   bone or tendons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Interfacing the geographic information system, remote sensing, and the
   soil conservation service-curve number method to estimate curve number
   and runoff volume in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia}},
Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Runoff coefficients are widely used as a diagnostic variable of runoff
   generation in process studies and as an important input parameter in
   hydrologic design. Many regions of Saudi Arabia do not have sufficient
   historical records and the detailed runoff information needed for
   physically based distribution models. The US Department of Agriculture,
   Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Number (USDA-NRCS-CN)
   method was used in this study for determining the curve number and
   runoff depth for Asir region, Saudi Arabia. Runoff curve number was
   determined based on the factors of hydrologic soil group, land use and
   land cover, and slope gradient in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia using
   the geographic information system (GIS). The region was not subjected
   before for any previous studies concerning runoff generation or
   rainwater harvesting by using GIS and remote sensing. ArcGIS 9.3 and the
   global positioning system were used to develop the soil map on the basis
   of samples collected during a field survey. Soil textures were
   identified and used to build a map of the hydrological soil groups.
   Unsupervised and supervised classification of Landsat images was used to
   generate land use and land cover maps. The land cover distribution in
   the study area revealed that the largest class in the area, barren and
   sparsely vegetated land, occupied 62,832.38 km(2) of the study area
   (more than 80 \% of the total area), followed by shrubland (15,212.66
   km(2)), cropland and pasture (52.34 km(2)), mixed shrubland/grassland
   (40.89 km(2)), and grassland (12.27 km(2)). Built-up land occupied only
   11.45 km(2). The slope map for the Asir region was generated from a 15-m
   digital elevation model. The GIS technique was used to develop the CN
   for the region based on the Soil Conservation Service method. The annual
   runoff depth was derived from the annual rainfall and CN per pixel using
   the raster calculator tool in ArcGIS. The rainfall distribution in the
   study area showed the wise identification of suitable sites for
   rainwater harvesting, as most of the constructed dams were located in
   the areas with higher rainfall. The analysis also revealed that the
   annual runoff for the study area ranged from 27 to 69 \% of the total
   rainfall, with variation as low as 80 to 300 mm/year. This is the
   highest amount of runoff that can be generated in Saudi Arabia. The
   runoff volume was calculated for the entire region using the previously
   developed runoff depth map and basin areas. The results showed that the
   runoff volume (M3) in the Asir region varied from as low as 237,000 m(3)
   to a maximum of 2,140,000 m(3); this result revealed a significant
   yearly amount of runoff that can be harvested for any use. Moreover, the
   calculated runoff depth in the area agreed with the actual dam
   capacities for the existing dams in the Asir region. This approach can
   be applied in other regions in Saudi Arabia for rainwater harvesting and
   groundwater recharge.}},

Volume = {{95}},

Pages = {{359-380}},

Abstract = {{The paper examines problems that relate to defects in elastic solids
   that are reinforced by aligned fibres. The category of problems deals
   with flaw bridging that can occur as a result of continuity of fibres
   across the defect in the matrix region. The defects can be a flaw of
   finite dimensions or cracks in the conventional sense. The presence of
   fibre continuity across a flaw exerts a displacement-dependent boundary
   condition at the faces of the crack that can alter the stress state at
   the boundary of the defect and contribute to fracture generation. The
   analysis of both a spheroidal flaw with fibre bridging and an idealized
   penny-shaped crack with fibre continuity across the faces of the crack
   leads to the conclusion that the stress amplification usually associated
   with extension of the flaw is suppressed by the fibre continuity. The
   second type of problem deals with the mechanics of flaws that can
   emanate from the extremities of an isolated cylindrical fibre in an
   elastic matrix of infinite extent. The problem is examined using a
   computational approach based on the boundary integral equation
   technique. The modelling is used to examine the role of the fibre-matrix
   elasticity mismatch on the stress intensity factors at the tip of
   penny-shaped cracks emanating from the ends of the fibre.}},

Abstract = {{The selection of best management practices to reduce soil and water
   pollution often requires estimation of soil properties. It is important
   to find an efficient and robust technique to simulate spatially
   correlated soils parameters. Co-kriging and co-simulation are techniques
   that can be used. These methods are limited in terms of computer
   simulation due to the problem of solving large co-kriging systems and
   difficulties in fitting a valid model of coregionalization. The order of
   complexity increases as the number of covariables increases. This paper
   presents a technique for the conditional simulation of a non-Gaussian
   vector random field on point support scale. The technique is termed
   Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The basic principle underlining
   ICA is the determination of a linear representation of non-Gaussian data
   so that the components are considered statistically independent. With
   such representation, it would be easy and more computationally efficient
   to develop direct variograms for the components. The process is
   presented in two stages. The first stage involves the ICA decomposition.
   The second stage involves sequential Gaussian simulation of the
   generated components (which are derived from the first stage). This
   technique was applied for spatially correlated extractable cations such
   as magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe) in a Canadian watershed. This paper has
   a strong application in stochastic quantification of uncertainties of
   soil attributes in soil remediation and soil rehabilitation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The emerging trend for electric utilities to install wind-based
   generation on a large scale into distribution networks, employing a
   doubly fed induction generator or full-converter turbine technologies is
   raising issues for distribution planning engineers with regard to
   flicker among other power-quality (PQ) issues. This paper investigates
   dynamic volt/var control, a viable flicker mitigation technique which
   exploits the reactive power capabilities of modern power-electronic
   interfaced wind turbine generators. Dynamic volt/var control essentially
   mitigates flicker by solely dispatching reactive power based on voltage
   fluctuations within the flicker frequency band. This technique can be
   incorporated as part of a wind farm multiobjective reactive
   power-control scheme, which facilitates regulating: 1) the voltage level
   at the point of common coupling (PCC), employing slow-acting voltage
   control or power factor control and 2) the flicker level at the PCC with
   fast-acting dynamic volt/var control. This two-level approach can reduce
   the wind farm flicker level up to 80\% and maintains the voltage level
   at the PCC well within acceptable bands. The results presented in this
   paper focus on a typical 25-kV medium-voltage distribution feeder
   integrating wind-based generation on a large scale. The performance of
   the two-level controller was tested for varying levels of penetration
   and wind speed conditions. The applicable standards and utility
   grid-code requirements are considered throughout.}},

Title = {{Direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flow over porous walls}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{784}},
Pages = {{396-442}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent channel
   flow over porous walls. In the fluid region the flow is governed by the
   incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, while in the porous layers
   the volume-averaged Navier-Stokes (VANS) equations are used, which are
   obtained by volume-averaging the microscopic flow field over a small
   volume that is larger than the typical dimensions of the pores. In this
   way the porous medium has a continuum description, and can be specified
   without the need of a detailed knowledge of the pore microstructure by
   independently assigning permeability and porosity. At the interface
   between the porous material and the fluid region, momentum-transfer
   conditions are applied, in which an available coefficient related to the
   unknown structure of the interface can be used as an error estimate. To
   set up the numerical problem, the velocity-vorticity formulation of the
   coupled NS and VANS equations is derived and implemented in a
   pseudo-spectral DNS solver. Most of the simulations are carried out at
   Re-tau = 180 and consider low-permeability materials; a parameter study
   is used to describe the role played by permeability, porosity, thickness
   of the porous material, and the coefficient of the momentum-transfer
   interface conditions. Among them permeability, even when very small, is
   shown to play a major role in determining the response of the channel
   flow to the permeable wall. Turbulence statistics and instantaneous flow
   fields, in comparative form to the flow over a smooth impermeable wall,
   are used to understand the main changes introduced by the porous
   material. A simulation at higher Reynolds number is used to illustrate
   the main scaling quantities.}},

Abstract = {{Combustion of switchgrass, a low-carbon fuel, generates energy and ash
   that can be recycled as a pozzolan in cement. This study aimed to
   optimize switchgrass combustion to achieve high-energy conversion and
   ash recycling value for cement. Combustion factors under investigation
   included temperature (350 degrees C, 450 degrees C, 550 degrees C, or
   650 degrees C) and retention time (1 h or 4 h). Energy release was
   quantified by thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning
   calorimetry, and ash pozzolanic activity was assessed with the concrete
   strength test. A numeric simulation model of the pozzolanic reaction,
   based on unbiased experimental data from Ca(OH)(2)-ash suspensions,
   provided insight into how combustion conditions affected the pozzolanic
   properties of switchgrass ash. Consequently, combustion at 550 degrees C
   for 4 h was recommended for concurrently optimizing the ash pozzolanic
   activity (114\%) and energy output (4.21 kJ/g) from switchgrass. (C)

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{96-106}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Double-sided electromechanical nano-bridges can potentially be used as
   angular speed sensors and accelerometers in rotary systems such as
   turbine blades and vacuum pumps. In such applications, the influences of
   the centrifugal force and rarefied flow should be considered in the
   analysis. In the present study, the non-linear dynamic pull-in
   instability of a double-sided nano-bridge is investigated incorporating
   the effects of angular velocity and rarefied gas damping. The non-linear
   governing equation of the nanostructure is derived using Euler-beam
   model and Hamilton's principle including the dispersion forces. The
   strain gradient elasticity theory is used for modeling the
   size-dependent behavior of the system. The reduced order method is also
   implemented to discretize and solve the partial differential equation of
   motion. The influences of damping, centrifugal force, length scale
   parameters, van der Waals force and Casimir attraction on the dynamic
   pull-in voltage are studied. It is found that the dispersion and
   centrifugal forces decrease the pull-in voltage of a nano-bridge.
   Dynamic response of the nano-bridge is investigated by plotting time
   history and phase portrait of the system. The validity of the proposed
   method is confirmed by comparing the results from the present study with
   the experimental and numerical results reported in the literature. (C)

Abstract = {{The formulation of the displacement dependent pressure load for shells
   of generic shape and plates is derived in the present study in
   curvilinear coordinates without any approximation and any hypothesis on
   material properties. Derivation is initially carried out for pressure
   load on the middle shell surface, and then for load on the external and
   internal surfaces by making use of a third-order shear and thickness
   deformation shell theory, which is a significant improvement for thick
   shells. The explicit formulation in curvilinear coordinates allows
   immediate implementation in numerical codes. An approximate formulation
   is also derived and compared to (i) the exact formulation and to (ii)
   the displacement independent pressure load which is still widely used in
   the literature. Applications to circular cylindrical shells and
   rectangular plates are presented. Comparison of results show that only
   the exact formulation for displacement dependent pressure load can be
   used for large deformations of shells and plates, while the displacement
   independent pressure load can be used only in case of small
   displacements of the middle surface (or middle plane). (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The control of the tip vortex, generated by a rectangular NACA 0012
   wing, via tip-mounted half-delta wings (HDWs), of different

   regardless of Lambda, c(r), and delta, the addition of HDWs consistently
   led to a diffused tip vortex. The degree of diffusion was, however,
   found to increase with decreasing Lambda and c(r). HDWs with c(r) <=
   50\% of the baseline-wing chord c caused a rapid diffusion of vorticity
   and rendered a weak circulation flowlike tip vortex, suggesting an
   enhanced wake-vortex decay and alleviation. The c(r) = 0.5c HDW also
   produced an improved lift-to-drag ratio. A unique double-vortex pattern
   also exhibited downstream of the c(r) <= 50\%c HDW wings. The

Abstract = {{The study was undertaken with the objective of formulating a fiber
   enriched functional bread by incorporating little millet flour (LMF).
   Wheat flour (WF) was replaced with LMF at various proportions (10, 30
   and 50\%) in the bread preparation. The developed breads were evaluated
   for physical, sensory and nutritional characteristics. The loaf volume,
   weight, height and specific volume were decreased significantly with
   increased levels of LMF. The wheat bread (control), 10 and 30 \% percent
   incorporation of LMF did not show significance difference in the sensory
   scores. Control and bread with 30 \% incorporation of LMF were evaluated
   further for nutritional characteristics. There was an increase in the
   percentage of micronutrients such as Iron (94\%), Zinc (29\%), Copper
   (70\%), Phosphorus (28\%) and also fiber (19\%) which improved the
   nutritional value of the wheat bread when substituted with LMF. The
   incorporation of LMF at 30\% level in bread can be considered as a
   functional and nutritional food choice for the management of diet
   related metabolic disorders.}},

Abstract = {{In North America, the seismic design of strap-braced cold-formed steel
   shear walls is carried out using the AISI S213 Standard, which is soon
   to be replaced by a new seismic specific standard AISI S400. Both
   standards require the use of a capacity-based design procedure in which
   the tension-only diagonal braces are assumed to act as the inelastic
   fuse elements in the pin connected seismic force resisting system, while
   all other elements remain essentially undamaged under loading.
   Experimental work has shown this assumption to be valid for walls with
   low aspect ratios; however, the testing of high aspect ratio walls has
   revealed that large moments develop in the frame members, which can
   result in their failure prior to yielding of the braces. This paper
   describes a simple method with which these frame moments can be
   determined and accounted for in the capacity-based design procedure. (C)

Abstract = {{The effects of mixing time and curing temperature on the uniaxial
   compressive strength (UCS) and microstructure of cemented hydraulic fill
   (CHF) and sodium silicate-fortified backfill (Gelfill) were investigated

   time periods ranging from 5 min to 60 min and cured at temperatures
   ranging from 5 degrees C to 50 degrees C for 7 d, 14 d or 28 d.
   Increasing the mixing time negatively influenced the UCS of Gelfill
   samples, but did not have a detectable effect on CHF samples. The curing
   temperature had a strong positive impact on the UCSs of both Gelfill and
   CHF. An elevated temperature caused rapid UCS development over the first
   14 d of curing. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) indicated that the
   pore size distribution and total porosity of Gelfill were altered by
   curing temperature. (C) 2015 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics,

Abstract = {{A thermally tunable 1 x 4 channel optical demultiplexer was designed
   using an ultra low-loss Si3N4 (propagation loss similar to 3.1 dB/m)
   waveguide. The demultiplexer has three 2 x 2 Mach-Zehnder
   interferometers (MZI), where each of the MZI contains two 2 x 2 general
   interference based multimode interference (MMI) couplers. The MMI
   couplers exhibit -3.3 dB to -3.7 dB power division ratios over a 50 nm
   wavelength range from 1530 nm to 1580 nm. The chrome-based (Cr) heaters
   placed on the delay arms of the MZI filters enable thermal tuning to
   control the optical phase shift in the MZI delay arms. This facilitates
   achieving moderately low crosstalk (14.5 dB) between the adjacent
   channels. The optical insertion loss of the demultiplexer per channel is
   between 1.5 dB to 2.2 dB over the 1550 nm to 1565 nm wavelength range.
   Error free performance (BER of 10(-12)) is obtained for all four 40 Gb/s
   data rate channels. The optical demultiplexer is an important tool
   towards building photonic integrated circuits with complex optical
   signal processing functionalities in the low-loss Si3N4 waveguide
   platform.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in low-cost diagnostic devices has recently gained attention,
   in part due to the rising cost of healthcare and the need to serve
   populations in resource-limited settings. A major challenge in the
   development of such devices is the need for hydrophobic barriers to
   contain polar bio-fluid analytes. Key approaches in lowering the cost in
   diagnostics have centered on (i) development of low-cost fabrication
   techniques/processes, (ii) use of affordable materials, or, (iii)
   minimizing the need for high-tech tools. This communication describes a
   simple, low-cost, adaptable, and portable method for patterning paper
   and subsequent use of the patterned paper in diagnostic tests. Our
   approach generates hydrophobic regions using a ball-point pen filled
   with a hydrophobizing molecule suspended in a solvent carrier. An empty
   ball-point pen was filled with a solution of trichloro perfluoroalkyl
   silane in hexanes (or hexadecane), and the pen used to draw lines on
   Whatman (R) chromatography 1 paper. The drawn regions defined the test
   zones since the trichloro silane reacts with the paper to give a
   hydrophobic barrier. The formation of the hydrophobic barriers is
   reaction kinetic and diffusion-limited, ensuring well defined narrow
   barriers. We performed colorimetric glucose assays and enzyme-linked
   immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) using the created test zones. To
   demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we fabricated multiple
   devices on a single piece of paper and demonstrated the reproducibility
   of assays on these devices. The overall cost of devices fabricated by
   drawing are relatively lower ( <US \$0.001 per device) than those
   derived from wax-printing (US\$0.05-0.003) or other approaches. (C) 2015

   investigated and the condition of fenugreek protein isolate (FPI)
   extraction was optimized using response surface methodology.
   RESULTSFPI had significantly (P< 0.05) higher protein and essential
   amino acid content (891.00 and 387.41gkg(-1), respectively) compared
   with soy protein isolate (SPI). FPI was rich in Asp and Glu, confirming
   the presence of bands in the acidic region (30-39 kDa) of its
   electrophoretic pattern. Differential scanning calorimeter thermography
   of both FPI and SPI showed two peaks with high denaturation temperature,
   confirming the presence of high protein content and hydrophobic amino
   acids. Protein solubility, foaming capacity, foam stability and emulsion
   stability of FPI were higher than SPI; moreover, both FPI and SPI showed
   pH-dependent protein functionalities.
   CONCLUSIONFenugreek seed protein extraction was optimized by control of

   the energy use and power demand of the anti-icing system while ensuring
   a safe protection. The formulations are carefully proposed from the
   physical and mathematical viewpoints; their performance is assessed by
   means of several numerical test cases to discern the most promising for
   each regime. The design optimization is conducted using the mesh
   adaptive direct search algorithm using quadratic and statistical
   surrogate models in the search step. The influence of the models on the

Abstract = {{Mode I delamination of a five harness satin weave carbon fibre composite
   and the corresponding toughening mechanisms are studied using a
   multiscale finite element model of delamination growth in a double
   cantilever beam (DCB) specimen. The toughening mechanisms related to the
   fabric structure are studied by embedding a meso-scale model of the
   fibre architecture in the delamination zone into a macro-scale model of
   a DCB specimen. The R-curves and the load displacement curves obtained
   from this analysis agree with the lower bound of the experimental
   results. The analysis identified two major toughening mechanisms: the
   inter-yarn locking ahead of the delamination front causing stress
   relaxation and the formation of sub-surfaces. Contribution of each
   toughening mechanism towards total delamination toughness is
   quantitatively evaluated, identifying the inter-yarn locking as the main
   source of toughening in mode I delamination of fabric composites.

Abstract = {{We report on the design and characterization of a silicon-on-insulator
   traveling-wave multi-electrode Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM). The 2-bit
   electro-optic (EO) digital-to-analog converter is formed by dividing a
   series push-pull MZM into two segments, one for each bit. The EO
   bandwidth of the longer segment of the MZM is measured to be 48 GHz at 0
   V reverse bias. We operate the device at speeds up to 50 GBd to create a
   four-level pulse amplitude modulation signal, and thus generating 100
   Gb/s on a single wavelength without signal processing at the transmitter
   or the receiver. The pre-forward error correction (FEC) bit error rate
   is estimated to be lower than the hard-decision FEC threshold of 3.8 x
   10(-3) over 1 km of standard single-mode fiber, and thus leading to
   error-free transmission at 100 Gb/s.}},

Title = {{Bidirectional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO) based design
   method for lattice structure to be fabricated by additive manufacturing}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{91-101}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Unlike traditional manufacturing methods, additive manufacturing can
   produce parts with complex geometric structures without significant
   increases in fabrication time and cost. One application of additive
   manufacturing technologies is the fabrication of customized lattice-skin
   structures which can enhance performance of products while minimizing
   material or weight. In this paper, a novel design method for the
   creation of periodic lattice structures is proposed. In this method,
   Functional Volumes (FVs) and Functional Surfaces (FSs) are first
   determined based on an analysis of the functional requirements. FVs can
   be further decomposed into several sub-FVs. These sub-FVs can be divided
   into two types: FV with solid and FV with lattice. The initial design
   parameters of the lattice are selected based on the proposed guidelines.
   Based on these parameters, a kernel based lattice frame generation
   algorithm is used to generate lattice wireframes within the given FVs.
   At last, traditional bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization
   is modified to optimize distribution of lattice struts' thickness. The
   design method proposed in this paper is validated through a case study,
   and provides an important foundation for the wide adoption of additive
   manufacturing technologies in the industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We describe phase-diversity optical coherent receivers (CRx) using the
   phase-shifting-interference (PSI) framework. The goals of the analysis
   are several-fold. First, we show that coherent detection can be realized
   with optical hybrids that have an arbitrary number of branches and phase
   shifts using a closed-form solution of the inphase-quadrature mapping.
   Second, we show that CRx with 2 x 4 90 degrees hybrids using balanced
   detection (BD) and CRx with 2 x 3 120 degrees hybrid using single-ended
   detection (SED) perform optimally compared to alternative
   configurations. A proof-of-concept WDM colorless 10 x 132-Gb/s PDM-QPSK
   transmission experiment is conducted. We demonstrate that an example of
   arbitrary phase diversity CRx with a 2 x 3 90 degrees hybrid SED
   operates with a 03 dB signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) penalty relative to
   conventional CRx at 6400 km and 4480 km for bit-error-rates below the
   threshold of 2 x 10(-2) and the threshold of 3.8 x 10(-3) respectively.
   The sensitivity degradation of the 2 x 390 degrees hybrid SED with
   respect to the 2 x 4 90 degrees hybrid BD in the shot noise limited
   regime at a distance of 4480 km is 3 dB, which matches well with the
   predicted penalty from the PSI analytical model. To the best of our
   knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to model a CRx using the PSI
   model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A model to calculate g-functions accounting for the axial variation of
   borehole wall temperatures and heat extraction rates due to thermal
   interaction between the fluid and the borehole wall is presented.
   Boreholes are divided into segments, with each borehole segment modeled
   as a finite line source. Borehole wall temperatures are calculated from
   the spatial and temporal superposition of the finite line source
   solution. A delta-circuit of thermal resistances is used to consider the
   heat transfer between the fluid and the borehole wall. A system of
   equations is built in the Laplace domain and solved for an equal inlet
   fluid temperature for all boreholes in the bore field. The values of the
   g-function tend toward the g-function obtained using a uniform heat
   extraction rate boundary condition as the borehole thermal resistance
   increases and tend toward the g-function obtained using a uniform
   temperature boundary condition as the borehole thermal resistance
   decreases. It is shown that modeling the thermal interaction between the
   fluid and the borehole wall is required to accurately predict the
   g-function. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission is one of the crucial elements of a motor vehicle's
   driveline that affects efficiency and dynamic performance of the
   vehicle. This paper studies the dynamical modeling, controller design,
   and experimental validation of a two-speed transmission for electric
   vehicles which has a specification of seamless gear shifting. The
   transmission incorporates a two-stage planetary gear set with common sun
   and common ring gears and two braking mechanisms to control the flow of
   power. The dynamical modeling of the driveline of an electric vehicle
   equipped with such a transmission is derived by exploiting the torque
   balance and virtual work principle. Thereafter, the Pontryagin Minimum
   Principle is applied to design an optimal shifting controller. This
   controller keeps the output speed and the output torque of the driveline
   constant during the gear shifting operation while minimizing the
   shifting time and the dissipation of energy caused by the internal
   brakes. Since the optimal control law provided by the Minimum Principle
   is open loop, a backstepping controller is designed to provide a
   stabilizing feedback law based on the optimal control inputs. Simulation
   and experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed
   transmission to exhibit smooth shifting without excessive oscillations
   in the output speed and torque. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{177-187}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The coupler-curve synthesis of four-bar linkages is a fundamental
   problem in kinematics. According to the Roberts-Chebyshev theorem, three
   cognate linkages can generate the same coupler curve. While the problem
   of linkage synthesis for coupler-curve generation is determined, it has
   been regarded as overdetermined, given that the number of coefficients
   in an algebraic coupler-curve equation exceeds that of linkage
   parameters available. In this paper, we develop a new formulation of the
   synthesis problem, whereby the linkage parameters are determined
   ``exactly{''}, within unavoidable roundoff error. A system of
   coupler-curve coefficient equations is derived, with as many equations
   as unknowns. The system is thus determined, which leads to exact
   solutions for the linkage parameters. A method of linkage synthesis from
   a known coupler-curve equation is further developed to find the three
   cognate mechanisms predicted by the Roberts-Chebyshev theorem. An
   example is included to demonstrate the method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). A single wire electrode
   EHD system was used with a set electrode gap of 1.5 cm, applied voltages
   of 10 kV, 12.5 kV and 15 kV in combination with air cross-flow of
   velocities 1 m/s, 1.5 m/s and 2 m/s. It was observed that the drying
   rate of wheat sample was significantly affected by applied voltage and
   air velocity. The drying rate increased with an increase in air velocity
   and applied voltage. This study also showed that wheat protein
   conformation was significantly affected by EHD drying. In the analysis
   of the Amide I region (1720 -1580 cm(-1)) of wheat protein, FT-IR
   spectra showed distinct valleys at 1682-1686 cm(-1) (beta-sheets), 1674
   cm(-1) (beta-sheets), 1664-1667 cm(-1) (turns), 1654-1657 cm(-1)
   (alpha-helices), 1651 cm(-1) (alpha-helices), 1645-1647 cm(-1) (Random
   coils) and 1633-1634 cm(-1) (beta-sheets). Peak fitting using Gaussian
   band shapes suggested that exposure to electric field influenced the
   hydrogen bonding pattern of wheat protein resulting in shifts between
   low and high frequency bands which further supported these results. (C)

Abstract = {{Aluminum-silicon (Al-Si) alloy based counter electrode substrates were
   developed for next generation solar cells. Controlled anodization was
   performed on the Al-Si alloys to form an aluminum oxide (AO) with
   corrosion resistant microstructure. Presence of secondary Si particles
   in the Al-Si alloy system facilitated electrical conduction across the
   insulating AO film. In this way, aluminum is rendered suitable as
   substrate for photovoltaic applications without having to resort to its
   coating with costly conductive metals such as titanium. Current
   density-voltage (J-V) measurements of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
   based on the new Al-Si alloys yielded a high power conversion efficiency
   (eta) of up to 6.13\% under 1 Sun illumination condition, essentially
   matching the conversion efficiency, eta = 6.7\%, of a reference DSSC
   with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass based electrode substrates.
   The microstructure of the Al-Si alloys and the anodized oxide films was
   studied in detail by FE-SEM and XPS and correlated to the device
   performance. Differences between the photovoltaic characteristics of the
   cells were analyzed further by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   and optical reflectance spectroscopy measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The feasibility of developing a high strength KOBM (Klockner Oxygen

   alternative cementing material was investigated. After two-hour
   carbonation reaction, steel slag compacts displayed a 2 h compressive
   strength of 80 MPa with a CO2 uptake of 13\%. Early strength gain was
   attributed to the carbonation of the slag's gamma-C2S component.
   Subsequent hydration enhanced the ultimate strength to 109 MPa, owing to
   the latent hydraulic reactivity of the beta-C2S component. The
   carbon-activated slag presented a more sustainable alternative to
   Portland cement as a primary binder for building products. In addition
   to conserving the natural resources and recycling the wastes, a
   potential carbon sink for the steel industry can be realized through its

   a systematic review and meta-analysis}},

Abstract = {{Background Transradial access for cardiac catheterisation results in
   lower bleeding and vascular complications than the traditional
   transfemoral access route. However, the increased radiation exposure
   potentially associated with transradial access is a possible drawback of
   this method. Whether transradial access is associated with a clinically
   significant increase in radiation exposure that outweighs its benefits
   is unclear. Our aim was therefore to compare radiation exposure between
   transradial access and transfemoral access for diagnostic coronary
   angiograms and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).
   Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the scientific
   literature by searching the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library
   databases with relevant terms, and cross-referencing relevant articles
   for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared radiation
   parameters in relation to access site, published from Jan 1, 1989, to
   June 3, 2014. Three investigators independently sorted the potentially
   relevant studies, and two others extracted data. We focused on the
   primary radiation outcomes of fluoroscopy time and kerma-area product,
   and used meta-regression to assess the changes over time. Secondary
   outcomes were operator radiation exposure and procedural time. We used
   both fixed-effects and random-effects models with inverse variance
   weighting for the main analyses, and we did confirmatory analyses for
   observational studies.
   Findings Of 1252 records identified, we obtained data from 24 published
   RCTs for 19 328 patients. Our primary analyses showed that transradial
   access was associated with a small but significant increase in
   fluoroscopy time for diagnostic coronary angiograms (weighted mean
   difference {[}WMD], fixed effect: 1.04 min, 95\% CI 0.84-1.24; p<0.0001)
   and PCI (1.15 min, 95\% CI 0.96-1.33; p<0.0001), compared with
   transfemoral access. Transradial access was also associated with higher
   kerma-area product for diagnostic coronary angiograms (WMD, fixed
   effect: 1.72 Gy.cm(2), 95\% CI -0.10 to 3.55; p=0.06), and significantly
   higher kerma-area product for PCI (0.55 Gy.cm(2), 95\% CI 0.08-1.02;
   p=0.02). Mean operator radiation doses for PCI with basic protection
   were 107 mu Sv (SD 110) with transradial access and 74 mu Sv (68) with
   transfemoral access; with supplementary protection, the doses decreased
   to 21 mu Sv (17) with transradial access and 46 mu Sv (9) with
   transfemoral. Meta-regression analysis showed that the overall
   difference in fl uoroscopy time between the two procedures has decreased
   significantly by 75\% over the past 20 years from 2 min in 1996 to about
   30 s in 2014 (p<0.0001). In observational studies, differences and
   effect sizes remained consistent with RCTs.
   Interpretation Transradial access was associated with a small but
   significant increase in radiation exposure in both diagnostic and
   interventional procedures compared with transfemoral access. Since
   differences in radiation exposure narrow over time, the clinical
   significance of this small increase is uncertain and is unlikely to
   outweigh the clinical benefits of transradial access.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors propose simple methods to evaluate the
   achievable rates and outage probability of a cognitive radio (CR) link
   that takes into account the imperfectness of spectrum sensing. In the
   considered system, the CR transmitter and receiver correlatively sense
   and dynamically exploit the spectrum pool via dynamic frequency hopping.
   Under imperfect spectrum sensing, false-alarm and miss-detection occur
   which cause impulsive interference emerged from collisions due to the
   simultaneous spectrum access of primary and cognitive users. That makes
   it very challenging to evaluate the achievable rates. By first examining
   the static link where the channel is assumed to be constant over time,
   they show that the achievable rate using a Gaussian input can be
   calculated accurately through a simple series representation. In the
   second part of this study, they extend the calculation of the achievable
   rate to wireless fading environments. To take into account the effect of
   fading, they introduce a piece-wise linear curve fitting-based method to
   approximate the instantaneous achievable rate curve as a combination of
   linear segments. It is then demonstrated that the ergodic achievable
   rate in fast fading and the outage probability in slow fading can be
   calculated to achieve any given accuracy level.}},

   continuum models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Volume = {{296}},

Abstract = {{Macroscopic continuum models are an essential tool to understand the
   complex transport phenomena that take place in gas diffusion layers
   (GDLs) used in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). Previous work has
   shown that macroscopic models require effective properties obtained
   under uniform saturation conditions to get a consistent physical
   formulation. This issue, mostly unappreciated in the open literature, is
   addressed in detail in this work. To this end, lattice Boltzmann
   simulations were performed on tomographic images of dry and
   water-invaded carbon-paper GDL subsamples with nearly uniform porosity
   and saturation distributions. The computed effective diffusivity shows
   an anisotropic dependence on local porosity similar to that reported for
   morphologically analogous GDLs. In contrast, the dependence on local
   saturation is rather isotropic, following a nearly quadratic power law.
   The capability of the local correlations to recover the layer-scale
   properties obtained from inhomogeneous GDLs is checked by global
   averaging. Good agreement is found between the upscaled results and the
   diffusivity data of the GDL from which the present subsamples were
   taken, as well as other global data presented in the literature. A
   higher blockage effect of local saturation is, however, expected for the
   under-the-rib region in operating PEFCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Multi-band power system stabilisers (MB-PSSs) PSS4B (IEEE standard
   421.5-2005) are advanced power system damping controllers that have
   evident advantages over conventional PSSs in damping low-frequency
   oscillatory modes. However, finding optimal settings for such
   controllers is challenging due to the increased complexity of the PSS4B
   structure. This study describes a methodology for MB-PSS parameter
   optimisation based on an improved modal performance index as a measure
   of the controller's stabilising effect. The tuning problem is formulated
   as a non-linear constrained optimisation search method: proposed modal
   performance index is chosen as an objective function to be minimised,
   while properly selected constraints ensure stability of the closed-loop
   system and robustness of the proposed design. The methodology is
   demonstrated on a benchmark system that is based on an existing network.
   Comparative analysis between the MB-PSSs with optimised settings and
   speed-based PSS1A-type stabilisers designed using the conventional
   methods show the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed
   methodology. The implemented approach has an advantage of being scalable
   and suitable for the model-based tuning of feedback controller of
   general structure. Additionally, several performance metrics and
   non-linear simulations in the ElectroMagnetic Transient Program (EMTP)
   software confirm superior characteristics of PSS4B.}},

Abstract = {{Mining complexes contain multiple sequential activities that are
   strongly interrelated. Extracting the material from different sources
   may be seen as the first main activity, and any change in the sequence
   of extraction of the mining blocks modify the activities downstream,
   including blending, processing and transporting the processed material
   to final stocks or ports. Similarly, modifying the conditions of
   operation at a given processing path or the transportation systems
   implemented may affect the suitability of using a mining sequence
   previously optimized. This paper presents a method to generate mining,
   processing and transportation schedules that account for the previously
   mentioned activities (or stages) associated with the mining complex
   simultaneously. The method uses an initial solution generated using
   conventional optimizers and improves it by mean of perturbations
   associated to three different levels of decision: block based
   perturbations, operating alternative based perturbations and
   transportation system based perturbation. The method accounts for
   geological uncertainty of several deposits by considering scenarios
   originated from combinations of their respective stochastic orebody
   simulations. The implementation of the method in a multipit copper
   operation shows its ability to reduce deviations from capacity and
   blending targets while improving the expected NPV (cumulative discounted
   cash flows), which highlight the importance of stochastic optimizers
   given their ability to generate more value with less risk. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Thulium-doped (Tm-doped) tellurite glass microspheres are used as laser
   media. Emission lines at wavelengths near 1975 nm are observed. The
   onset of laser emission is achieved with 8.6 and 30 mu W of coupled pump
   power and injected pump power, respectively, at a wavelength of 1554 nm.
   To the authors' knowledge, these are the lowest laser threshold values
   recorded for a Tm-doped tellurite glass microcavity. Intrinsic Q-factors
   above 106 for the undoped tellurite glass microspheres assert the
   quality of the fabrication processes. An optical intrinsic Q-factor
   comparison between Tm-doped tellurite and undoped tellurite microspheres
   shows that ion absorption is the dominant loss source at pump
   wavelengths. Lower lasing threshold powers and higher power conversion
   are observed at longer pump wavelengths in agreement with theoretical
   models. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Pediatric patients treated with cranial radiation are at high
   risk of developing lasting cognitive impairments. We sought to identify
   anatomical changes in both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in
   radiation-treated patients and in mice, in which the effect of radiation
   can be isolated from other factors, the time course of anatomical change
   can be established, and the effect of treatment age can be more fully
   characterized. Anatomical results were compared between species.
   Methods and Materials: Patients were imaged with T1-weighted magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) after radiation treatment. Nineteen
   radiation-treated patients were divided into groups of 7 years of age
   and younger (7-) and 8 years and older (8+) and were compared to 41
   controls. C57BL6 mice were treated with radiation (n = 52) or sham
   treated (n = 52) between postnatal days 16 and 36 and then assessed with
   in vivo and/or ex vivo MRI. In both cases, measurements of WM and GM
   volume, cortical thickness, area and volume, and hippocampal volume were
   compared between groups.
   Results: WM volume was significantly decreased following treatment in 7-
   and 8+ treatment groups. GM volume was unchanged overall, but cortical
   thickness was slightly increased in the 7- group. Results in mice mostly
   mirrored these changes and provided a time course of change, showing
   early volume loss and normal growth. Hippocampal volume showed a
   decreasing trend with age in patients, an effect not observed in the
   mouse hippocampus but present in the olfactory bulb.
   Conclusions: Changes in mice treated with cranial radiation are similar
   to those in humans, including significant WM and GM alterations. Because
   mice did not receive any other treatment, the similarity across species
   supports the expectation that radiation is causative and suggests mice
   provide a representative model for studying impaired brain development
   after cranial radiation and testing novel treatments. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Finite conductivity, size dependency and surface layer are known as
   crucial factors that affect the electromechanical response and pull-in
   instability of micro/nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS).
   However, these effects are yet ignored on modeling the instability of
   MEMS/NEMS fabricated from functionally graded materials (FGMs). Herein,
   a modified continuum model is developed to incorporate these effects on
   the dynamic behavior and electromechanical instability of double-sided
   FGM NEMS bridge. Using Gurtin Murdoch model in conjunction with nonlocal
   Eringen elasticity, the governing equations of the nano-bridges is
   derived considering the surface layer and size dependency. The Coulomb
   and Casimir forces are incorporated in the governing equation
   considering the corrections due to the finite conductivity of FGM
   (relative permittivity and plasma frequency). The validity of the
   proposed method is elucidated by comparing the results obtained from the
   present study with the results reported in the literature. The stability
   analysis of the nanostructure is conducted by plotting time history and
   phase portraits. The effects of various parameters including finite
   conductivity, nonlocal parameter, surface stresses and material
   characteristics on the dynamic pull-in behavior of the nano-bridges are
   studied. The obtained results imply a significant impact of the
   abovementioned corrections on the instability threshold and pull-in
   parameters of the FGM nanobridge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{1149-1159}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the thermal instability of rectangular delaminated
   composite plates. A solution procedure is presented based on the
   third-order shear deformation theory by taking into consideration the
   von Karman geometrical nonlinearity. The proposed model is capable of
   analyzing both local buckling of the delaminated base laminate and
   sublaminate as well as the global buckling of the plate. The
   thermomechanical properties are temperature-dependent. The nonlinear
   equilibrium equations, derived by the minimum total potential energy
   principle, are solved by using the Ritz method along with the
   Newton-Raphson iterative procedure. Numerical results shed a light on
   the effects of embedded delamination, stacking sequences, and boundary
   conditions on the equilibrium path, thermal bifurcation points, buckling
   mode, in-plane displacement, normal/shear strain, and bending moment of
   the composite plates. It is found that the delamination leads to a
   substantial reduction in the thermal load-carrying capacity.
   Furthermore, depending on the boundary conditions and stacking sequence,
   the response of the perfect composite plates could be either of the
   bifurcation type or of the unique stable path. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In the first part of this study, the hydrogen and oxygen permeabilities
   of Nafion were measured. The aim of the second part of this study
   presented here is to physically characterize the influence of the
   aqueous phase, the solid phase, and the intermediate phase in Nafion on
   the macroscopic hydrogen and oxygen permeabilities. Hereto, a resistor
   network model morphologically representative for Nafion based on
   structural investigations reported in the literature is presented in
   which the different phases are described by individual permeabilities.
   As a result of the simulations, an enlarged permeability of the solid
   phase in comparison to that of dry Nafion had to be assumed in order to
   reproduce the measured influence of temperature and relative humidity on
   the permeability. This increase of the permeability of the solid phase
   toward greater water uptake was explained by the effect of water as a
   plasticizer and the resulting softening of the polymeric matrix. On the
   basis of the identified mechanisms, approaches to reduce the gas
   permeability of polymer electrolyte membranes are identified and
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum-based metal matrix composite (MMC) materials containing SiC,
   AIN, Si3N4 or BN were processed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). Ceramic
   powder type, size and content were investigated to determine their
   effect on sinter quality. SiC, AIN and Si3N4 proved to be amenable to
   this style of processing whereas all systems containing BN were not.
   Full densification of MMCs that incorporated finer ceramic particles was
   problematic due to the presence of ceramic clusters and the extent to
   which aluminum could be forced into these regions. MMCs that
   incorporated coarser ceramic particles were more easily densified, but
   their hardness benefits were inferior. Three point bend tests proved to
   be an effective tool in determining the relative sinter quality of MMC
   systems. SiC outperformed AIN MMC samples in bend tests. Excellent
   ductility and bend strength was developed at low temperatures, while
   equivalent AlN-bearing materials required significantly higher
   temperatures to achieve comparable properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{First-principles calculations were performed to investigate the phase
   stability and transition within four monolayer transition-metal
   dichalcogenide (TMD) systems, i.e., MX2 (M = Mo or W and X = S or Se)
   under coupled electron doping and lattice deformation. With the lattice
   distortion and electron doping density treated as state variables, the
   energy surfaces of different phases were computed, and the diagrams of
   energetically preferred phases were constructed. These diagrams assess
   the competition between different phases and predict conditions of phase
   transitions for the TMDs considered. The interplay between lattice
   deformation and electron doping was identified as originating from the
   deformation induced band shifting and band bending. Based on our
   findings, a potential design strategy combining an efficient
   electrolytic gating and a lattice straining to achieve controllable
   phase engineering in TMD monolayers was demonstrated. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle (NP) size and charge play key roles in bioconjugation
   chemistry, imaging and drug delivery. Although the electrophoretic
   mobility and hydrodynamic size are routinely measured, interpreting
   these data can be extremely difficult. Here, the challenge is addressed
   via an electrokinetic model for spheres bearing a soft amphoteric
   corona, the charge of which is regulated by a multi-component
   electrolyte. The model is applied to NPs with a metallic core to which
   are grafted poly(ethylene glycol) chains with either weak acid or
   amphiprotic end groups. The results elucidate the separate roles of
   electrolyte pH and ionic strength on the electrophoretic mobility and
   diffusion coefficient. In this study, the forces were evaluated
   directly, rather than from the Stokeslet velocity disturbances. While
   the second-order convergence was demonstrated by both methods, the
   direct approach, which uses only the inner part of the global solution,
   furnished superior accuracy and robustness. This may benefit future
   attempts to model the dielectric and electroacoustic properties of these
   complex nanoparticulates.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular basis of changes in structure, cellular location, and
   function of the Golgi apparatus during male germ cell differentiation is
   unknown. To deduce cognate Golgi proteins, we isolated germ cell Golgi
   fractions, and 1318 proteins were characterized, with 20 localized in
   situ. The most abundant protein, GL54D of unknown function, is
   characterized as a germ cell-specific Golgi-localized type II integral
   membrane glycoprotein. TM9SF3, also of unknown function, was revealed to
   be a universal Golgi marker for both somatic and germ cells. During
   acrosome formation, several Golgi proteins (GBF1, GPP34, GRASP55)
   localize to both the acrosome and Golgi, while GL54D, TM9SF3, and the
   Golgi trafficking protein TMED7/p27 are segregated from the acrosome.
   After acrosome formation, GL54D, TM9SF3, TMED4/p25, and TMED7/p27
   continue to mark Golgi identity as it migrates away from the acrosome,
   while the others (GBF1, GPP34, GRASP55) remain in the acrosome and are
   progressively lost in later steps of differentiation. Cytoplasmic
   HSP70.2 and the endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein-folding enzyme
   PDILT are also Golgi recruited but only during acrosome formation. This
   resource identifies abundant Golgi proteins that are expressed
   differentially during mitosis, meiosis, and postacrosome Golgi
   migration, including the last step of differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{The advancement of technological development in underground mines
   together with increasing demands of raw materials while ore deposit in
   the surface depleted continuously, has led underground mines to go even
   deeper up to more than 3 km nowadays. As mine delves deeper into the
   earth, the rock pressure and virgin rock temperature rise, which in turn
   have an adverse effect on the environment and thus lead to a higher
   cost. Typically, air ventilation itself is not sufficient to remove the
   heat generated, whence air conditioning system has to be added. This
   paper evaluates thermal management in underground mines via
   computational fluid dynamics approach. The three-dimensional underground
   cul-de-sac tunnel model together with its ventilation auxiliary and
   mining machinery is developed comprising conservation equations of
   turbulent mass, momentum and energy. Effect of ventilation flow rate,
   cooling load, virgin rock temperature and the heat rejection from mining
   machinery were evaluated with regards to the thermal comfort. Finally,
   this model can be used to develop an optimum or near-to-optimum
   ventilation and air-conditioning strategy in underground environment.

Abstract = {{Significant improvements in production and purification have been
   achieved since the first approved influenza vaccines were administered
   75 years ago. Global surveillance and fast response have limited the
   impact of the last pandemic in 2009. In case of another pandemic,
   vaccines can be generated within three weeks with certain platforms.
   However, our Achilles heel is at the quantification level. Production of
   reagents for the quantification of new vaccines using the SRID, the main
   method formally approved by regulatory bodies, requires two to three
   months. The impact of such delays can be tragic for vulnerable
   populations. Therefore, efforts have been directed toward developing
   alternative quantification methods, which are sensitive, accurate, easy
   to implement and independent of the availability of specific reagents.
   The use of newly-developed antibodies against a conserved region of
   hemagglutinin (HA), a surface protein of influenza, holds great promises
   as they are able to recognize multiple subtypes of influenza; these new
   antibodies could be used in immunoassays such as ELISA and slot-blot
   analysis. HA concentration can also be determined using reversed-phase
   high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), which obviates the
   need for antibodies but still requires a reference standard. The number
   of viral particles can be evaluated using ion-exchange HPLC and
   techniques based on flow cytometry principles, but non-viral vesicles
   have to be taken into account with cellular production platforms. As new
   production systems are optimized, new quantification methods that are
   adapted to the type of vaccine produced are required. The nature of
   these new-generation vaccines might dictate which quantification method
   to use. In all cases, an alternative method will have to be validated
   against the current SRID assay. A consensus among the scientific
   community would have to be reached so that the adoption of new
   quantification methods would be harmonized between international
   laboratories. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mammalian cell cultures are increasingly used for the production of
   complex biopharmaceuticals including viral vectors and vaccines. HEK293
   is the predominant cell line used for the transient expression of
   recombinant proteins and a well-established system for the production of
   viral vectors. Understanding metabolic requirements for high
   productivity in HEK293 cells remains an important area of investigation.
   Many authors have presented approaches for increased productivity
   through optimization of cellular metabolism from two distinct
   perspectives. One is a non-targeted approach, which is directed to
   improving feeding strategies by addition of exhausted or critical
   substrates and eventually removal of toxic metabolites. Alternatively, a
   targeted approach has attempted to identify specific targets for
   optimization through better understanding of the cellular metabolism
   under different operating conditions. This review will present both
   approaches and their successes with regards to improvement of viral
   production in HEK293 cells outlining the key relations between HEK293
   cell metabolism and viral vector productivity. Also, we will summarize
   the current knowledge on HEK293 metabolism indicating remaining issues
   to address and problems to resolve to maximize the productivity of viral
   vectors in HEK293 cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The intrinsic hydrophobic character of polypropylene limits its
   performance in many porous membrane applications. This can be improved
   by hydrophilic modification of the film surface through blending with
   hydrophilic polymers. For producing the precursor films and,
   consequently, microporous membranes with the appropriate crystalline
   lamellar morphology, the polypropylene chains should preserve their
   elongated form to serve as initial nuclei for the later development of
   lamellar crystals. The relaxation time of the chains is the most
   important factor for this stage. Commercial maleic anhydride and acrylic
   acid grafted polypropylenes were melt blended with a polypropylene at
   different weight ratios. The results showed that the modifiers lowered
   the crystalline orientation of the blends as compared to neat
   polypropylene films. The effect of the modifier on the melt relaxation
   spectra of the blends was investigated, and a linear relationship was
   found between the characteristic relaxation time of the blends and their
   crystalline orientation function.}},

Title = {{Identification of the active components in Bone Marrow Soup: a mitigator
   against irradiation-injury to salivary glands}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{In separate studies, an extract of soluble intracellular contents from
   whole bone marrow cells, named ``Bone Marrow (BM) Soup{''}, was reported
   to either improve cardiac or salivary functions post-myocardial
   infarction or irradiation (IR), respectively. However, the active
   components in BM Soup are unknown. To demonstrate that proteins were the
   active ingredients, we devised a method using proteinase K followed by
   heating to deactivate proteins and for safe injections into mice. BM
   Soup and ``deactivated BM Soup{''} were injected into mice that had
   their salivary glands injured with 15Gy IR. Control mice received either
   injections of saline or were not IR. Results at week 8 post-IR showed
   the `deactivated BM Soup' was no better than injections of saline, while
   injections of native BM Soup restored saliva flow, protected salivary
   cells and blood vessels from IR-damage. Protein arrays detected several
   angiogenesis-related factors (CD26, FGF, HGF, MMP-8, MMP-9, OPN, PF4,
   SDF-1) and cytokines (IL-1ra, IL-16) in BM Soup. In conclusion, the
   native proteins (but not the nucleic acids, lipids or carbohydrates)
   were the therapeutic ingredients in BM Soup for functional salivary
   restoration following IR. This molecular therapy approach has clinical
   potential because it is theoretically less tumorigenic and immunogenic
   than cell therapies.}},

   with random IDs, was only briefly mentioned. Refined results with
   detailed proofs for this model are given in this article. Our analysis
   shows that, with high probability, it takes about clogn steps to locate
   any node, where n is the total number of nodes in the network and c is a
   constant that does not depend on n.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the nature and antimicrobial activity of ozonolysis
   transformation products (OTPs) of levofloxacin (LEV), a frequently

   bioassays, the Kirby-Bauer test and the broth microdilution assay, were
   used to measure changes in the antimicrobial activity of solutions at
   low LEV to O-3 molar ratios (2: 1, 2: 3 and 1: 3) compared to solutions
   without added O-3 (LEV: O-3 1: 0). The Kirby-Bauer test was not
   sensitive enough to detect significant differences in the growth
   inhibition zones in samples LEV: O-3 2: 1 and LEV: O-3 1: 0; however,
   the broth microdilution assay showed that bacterial growth inhibition
   was significantly lower (P< 0.001) in the solutions exposed to O-3. Loss
   of antimicrobial activity in LEV: O-3 2: 1 solutions of (48 +/- 16)\%
   was in agreement with the concentration decrease of LEV of (36 +/- 3)\%
   in those same samples. A method of identification of OTPs using XCMS
   Online was applied to LEV: O-3 2: 1 and 1: 0 samples and indicated the
   presence of an OTP of LEV of formula C18H20O5N3F, which was identified
   as LEV-N-oxide. The molecular structure of this compound was partially
   confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry experiments. This study showed
   that even at sub-optimal ozone doses, OTPs of higher antimicrobial

Abstract = {{The impacts of climate change on water quality in the Pike River
   watershed, an important contributor of nutrient loads into the northern
   arm of Lake Champlain, were simulated for the time horizon 2041-2070.
   Four water quality scenarios were simulated using a calibrated version
   of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) customized to Quebec
   agroclimatic conditions. Three of the scenarios were generated using
   climate data simulated with the Fourth-generation Canadian Regional
   Climate Model (CRCM4). The fourth scenario was generated using the
   climate simulated with the Arpege Regional Climate Model. Potential mean
   climate-induced changes in sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen yield
   projected by these scenarios were then analyzed for the 2050 horizon. In
   addition, the impacts of the different sources of climate projection
   uncertainty were assessed by comparing climate model initial conditions,
   and climate model physical structure effects on the hydrochemical
   projections. Only one climate scenario projected a significant increase
   in mean annual total phosphorus {[}10 metrics tons (t) yr(-1) or 14\%]
   and total nitrogen (260 t yr(-1) or 17\%) loads. However, when shorter
   time spans (seasonal and monthly scales) were considered, several
   significant changes were detected, especially in winter. Sediment and
   nutrient loadings, in winter, were predicted to become three to four
   times higher than current levels. These increases were attributed to a
   greater vulnerability of soils to erosion in winter due to the decrease
   in the snowpack, early onset of spring snowmelt, a greater number of
   rainfall events, and snowmelt episodes caused by higher winter and
   spring temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Ever-increasing requirements for structural performance drive the
   research and the development of stronger, tougher and lighter materials.
   Specific microstructures, heterogeneities or hybrid compositions are now
   used in modern materials to generate high performance structures. Pushed
   to the extreme, these concepts lead to architectured materials, which
   contain highly controlled structures at length scales which are
   intermediate between the microscale and the size of the component. This
   review focuses on dense architectured materials made of building blocks
   of well-defined size and shape, arranged in two or three dimensions.
   These building blocks are stiff so their deformation remains small and
   within elastic limits, but their interfaces can channel cracks and
   undergo large deformations. These basic principles lead to building
   blocks which can slide, rotate, separate or interlock collectively,
   providing a wealth of tunable mechanisms. Nature is well ahead of
   engineers in making use of architectured materials. Materials such as
   bone, teeth or mollusc shells are made of stiff building blocks of
   well-defined sizes and shapes, bonded together by deformable
   bio-adhesives. These natural materials demonstrate how the interplay
   between building block properties, shape, size and arrangement together
   with non-linear behaviour at the interfaces generate unusual
   combinations of stiffness, strength and toughness. In this review we
   discuss the general principles underlying the structure and mechanics of
   engineering architectured materials and of biological and bio-inspired
   architectured materials. Recent progress and remaining issues in the
   modelling, design optimisation and fabrication of these materials are
   also presented. The discussion draws from examples in the engineering
   and natural worlds, emphasising not only how natural materials can help
   us improve existing architectured materials, but also how they can
   inspire entirely new structural materials with unusual and highly
   attractive combinations of properties.}},

Abstract = {{Amine-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) dispersed in
   water are investigated as CO2 absorbents. MWCNTs grown by chemical vapor
   deposition on stainless steel meshes form open forests that can be
   coated via a RF capacitively coupled glow discharge. When treating the
   MWCNTs in an atmosphere containing either pure ammonia or mixtures of
   ammonia and ethylene for 5 min, grafting of nitrogen functional groups
   or deposition of a nitrogen-rich plasma polymer layer occurs. In
   particular, for a 1: 1 mixture, a 10 nm thick plasma polymer layer coats
   the MWCNTs. This layer contains about 19 N at\%, and 12\% of these
   nitrogen atoms are nucleophilic sites (such as amines) that may react
   with CO2. These functional groups not only enhance the absorption of
   CO2, but also increase the hydrophilic character of the MWCNTs, allowing
   them to stay suspended in water for at least three months at room
   temperature. The CO2 absorption capacity of this nanofluid is 36\%
   higher than that of water, with a MWCNT concentration of about 40 m
   gL(-1).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present techniques for providing on-demand structural
   redundancy for Coarse-Grained Re-configurable Array (CGRAs) and a
   calculus for determining the gains of reliability when applying these
   replication techniques from the perspective of safety-critical parallel
   loop program applications. Here, for protecting massively parallel loop
   computations against errors like soft errors, well-known replication
   schemes such as Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) and Triple Modular
   Redundancy (TMR) must be applied to each single Processor Element (PE)
   rather than one based on application requirements for reliability and
   Soft Error Rates (SERs). Moreover, different voting options and signal
   replication schemes are investigated. It will be shown that hardware
   voting may be accomplished at negligible hardware cost, i.e. less than
   two percent area overhead per PE, for a class of reconfigurable
   processor arrays called Tightly Coupled Processor Arrays (TCPAs). As a
   major contribution of this paper, a formal analysis of the reliability
   achievable by each combination of replication and voting scheme for
   parallel loop executions on CGRAs in dependence of a given SER and
   application timing characteristics (schedule) is elaborated. Using this
   analysis, error detection latencies may be computed and proper decisions
   which replication scheme to choose at runtime to guarantee a maximal
   probability of failure on-demand can be derived. Finally,
   fault-simulation results are provided and compared with the formal
   analysis of reliability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using multi-crystalline samples of Bridgman-grown CuInSe2+x, containing
   added quantities of elemental sodium or Na2Se, detailed XPS measurements
   were made to determine the location and action of the sodium. Here, the
   XPS peaks Se 3d, Na 1s and 0 1s were given special attention. In
   particular, two main 3d peaks were observed at binding energies of 54.5
   and 59 eV. The first of these, previously assigned mainly to the basic
   CuInSe2 compound, increased with argon etching time, starting from the
   ingot surface, but was little affected by the presence of the Na.
   However, the second peak only appeared when Na or Na2Se had been
   previously added to the melt. The intensity of this 59 eV peak increased
   with that of the Na 1s peak at 1071 eV at the surface and with the
   atomic percentage of the Na added to the Bridgman melt. It also
   increased somewhat with the amount of contaminant oxygen present in the
   ingots. The 59 eV peak was thus tentatively assigned to Na2SeO3
   resulting from the air-oxidation of Na2Se. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous health monitoring is a mobile health service with the aim of
   monitoring patients' conditions anytime and anywhere by collecting and
   transferring biosignal data from patients to health-service providers
   (e.g., healthcare centers). As a critical issue in ubiquitous health
   monitoring, wireless resource allocation can influence the performance
   of health monitoring, and the majority of work in wireless resource
   allocation for health monitoring has focused on quality-of-service
   oriented allocation schemes with primary challenges at the physical and
   MAC layers. Recently, quality-of-experience (QoE) oriented resource
   allocation schemes in wireless health monitoring have attracted
   attentions as a promising design to a better service of healthcare
   monitoring. In this paper, we overview the metrics of assessing the
   quality of medical images, and discuss the performance of these metrics
   in QoE-oriented resource allocation for health monitoring. We start with
   addressing the state-of-the-art QoE metrics by providing a taxonomy of
   the different metrics employed in assessing medical images. We then
   present the design of resource allocation schemes for health monitoring.
   After that, we present a case study to compare the performance of
   different classes of metrics in designing resource allocation schemes.
   We end the paper with a few open issues in the design of novel QoE
   metrics for resource allocation in health monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a novel adaptive reduced-rank receive
   processing strategy based on joint preprocessing, decimation and
   filtering (JPDF) for large-scale multiple-antenna systems. In this
   scheme, a reduced-rank framework is employed for linear receive
   processing and multiuser interference suppression based on the
   minimization of the symbol-error-rate (SER) cost function. We present a
   structure with multiple processing branches that performs a
   dimensionality reduction, where each branch contains a group of jointly
   optimized preprocessing and decimation units, followed by a linear
   receive filter. We then develop stochastic gradient (SG) algorithms to
   compute the parameters of the preprocessing and receive filters, along
   with a low-complexity decimation technique for both binary phase shift
   keying (BPSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols.
   In addition, an automatic parameter selection scheme is proposed to
   further improve the convergence performance of the proposed reduced-rank
   algorithms. Simulation results are presented for time-varying wireless
   environments and show that the proposed JPDF minimum-SER receive
   processing strategy and algorithms achieve a superior performance than
   existing methods with a reduced computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to examine the nonlinear size-dependent
   electro-elasto-statics/dynamics of a MEMS with an initially curved
   deformable electrode, based on the modified couple stress theory; in
   particular, the nonlinear motion characteristics of an initially curved
   deformable electrode actuated by a combination of DC and AC voltages are
   examined, taking into account small-size effects through use of the
   modified couple stress theory. The deformable electrode is modelled by
   means of an initially curved Euler-Bernoulli microbeam theory; the
   coupling between the electrical field and restoring microbeam force is
   demonstrated by electrical/displacement nonlinearities in the continuous
   model of the system, which is obtained by means of Hamilton's principle.
   The Galerkin method is employed to obtain a high-dimensional
   reduced-order model of the continuous system. The reduced-order model is
   solved by means of the pseudo-arclength continuation technique in order
   to analyse pull-in instabilities, snap-through motions, and nonlinear
   dynamical behaviour. Particularly, the electro-elasto-static deformation
   of the deformable electrode and pull-in instabilities are analysed when
   the system is subject to a DC voltage. The electro-elasto-dynamic
   motions of the deformable electrode are also analysed when the system is
   subject to both DC and AC voltages; the AC frequency-motion and AC
   amplitude-motion characteristics of the system are examined in the
   presence of coupled mechanical and electrical nonlinearities. A
   stability analysis is conducted via the Floquet theory. The importance
   of employing the modified couple stress theory, rather than the
   classical continuum theory, is highlighted by comparing the system
   response based on each of these theories. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study identifies challenges that native Chinese-speaking
   undergraduate engineering students face in researching and writing an
   academic paper in comparison with their native English-speaking peers.
   With growing enrolment of Chinese students in North America, the
   question of how best to enhance these students' learning experiences
   through library instruction and services is increasingly important. In
   this study, researchers recruited 17 participants (eight native
   Chinese-speaking and nine native English-speaking students) from a
   communication in engineering course at McGill University, and conducted
   a preliminary interview, an online survey, and an in-depth interview to
   gather data about each student's research experience. The online survey
   findings, which were used to inform the in-depth interview questions,
   were reported in a previous publication. The current article presents
   the qualitative findings from the in-depth interviews only. Findings
   show that native Chinese-speaking students have unique
   information-related challenges in the areas of searching, evaluating
   information, reading, writing, and citing. Challenges with specific
   elements of searching (such as locating full text) and writing (such as
   creating an outline) were shared among members of both groups.
   Recommendations for librarians, engineering instructors, and staff in
   other units serving international students are also provided. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Recent interest in high-angle-of-attack flight, aerobatic maneuvering,
   vertical/short takeoff and landing, etc., of small unmanned aerial
   vehicles necessitates more detailed modeling of the complex aerodynamics
   associated with these flight regimes. This includes modeling the effect
   of the propeller slipstream, also called prop wash, which is the main
   source of airflow that helps maintain lift and control during near-zero
   forward-speed flight like that encountered during vertical/short takeoff
   and landing, as well as during high-angle-of-attack flight/aerobatic
   maneuvering like hovering. Propeller slipstream models based on
   conventional theories, such as the momentum theory, have been used
   extensively in the literature to predict the induced air velocity within
   the slipstream. However, because these conventional theories consider
   only acceleration of air within the slipstream and not diffusion, their
   applicability in regions far downstream of the propeller where diffusion
   is dominant, is questionable. This paper presents a propeller slipstream
   model that considers both acceleration and diffusion within the
   slipstream using simple analytical and semi-empirical equations. The
   proposed model is shown to be in good agreement with the experimental
   data for several different propellers and configurations, up to similar
   to 6 propeller diameters downstream of the propeller plane, with an rms
   error of 0-2 m/s in velocity. As well, the proposed model matches the
   simplicity of conventional models and is therefore suitable for
   real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{Metal strip waveguides and devices suitable for high-speed digital
   signal transmission at both microwave and optical frequencies are
   fabricated and demonstrated in this work. The waveguide structure
   consists of three metal strips forming a coplanar waveguide (CPW) to
   support a microwave mode. In the proposed structure, the signal line
   consists of a copper strip sandwiched between two thin gold layers. The
   CPW ground planes are thin gold strips supporting long-range surface
   plasmon polaritons (LRSPPs) at optical frequencies. Thus, the proposed
   structure can simultaneously support LRSPPs at optical frequencies and
   microwave signals up to at least 40 GHz. The metalizations are patterned
   using bilayer photolithography followed by thermal evaporation. Then, to
   create the signal waveguide, an O-2 plasma etch of the cladding and
   copper E-beam evaporation are used. The fabrication process steps are
   verified through experimental characterization. Microwave and optical
   transmission through the fabricated devices is demonstrated using radio
   frequency probes applied to the top of the device and optical fibers in
   an end-fire coupling configuration, respectively. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Potassium-catalyzed steam gasification experiments of ash-free,coal were
   conducted in a drop-down reactor to Study the influence of the catalyst
   loading, temperature, H2O/H-2 ratio, and heating protocol. The higher
   the catalyst loading, the faster the,carbon conversion; however, at an
   initial K/C ratio of 0.1, a saturation effect (decrease in reactivity
   per potassium atom) was observed. At higher gasification temperatures,
   this saturation, effect was more pronounced and likely caused by
   increased potassium mobility. The catalyst accelerated predominately the
   oxygen transfer reactions and not the methane formation. Methane is
   produced Via direct hydrogenation of the carbon surface. The selectivity
   to methane and carbon monoxide was increased by reducing the H2O/H-2
   ratio, which would represent conditions in a gasifier away from the gas
   inlet. Lastly, the heating protocol influenced mainly the initial rate
   of gasification, up to 20\% carbon conversion beyond that, the rates
   were similar.}},

Abstract = {{Microarrays allow the miniaturization and multiplexing of biological
   assays while only requiring minute amounts of samples. As a consequence
   of the small volumes used for spotting and the assays, evaporation often
   deteriorates the quality, reproducibility of spots, and the overall
   assay performance. Glycerol is commonly added to antibody microarray
   printing buffers to decrease evaporation; however, it often decreases
   the binding of antibodies to the surface, thereby negatively affecting
   assay sensitivity. Here, combinations of 14 hygroscopic chemicals were
   used as additives to printing buffers for contact-printed antibody
   microarrays on four different surface chemistries. The ability of the
   additives to suppress evaporation was quantified by measuring the
   residual buffer volume in open quill pins over time. The seven best
   additives were then printed either individually or as a 1:1 mixture of
   two additives, and the homogeneity, intensity, and reproducibility of
   both the spotted protein and of a fluorescently labeled analyte in an
   assay were quantified. Among the 28 combinations on the four slides,
   many were found to outperform glycerol, and the best additive mixtures
   were further evaluated by changing the ratio of the two additives. We
   observed that the optimal additive mixture was dependent on the slide
   chemistry, and that it was possible to increase the binding of
   antibodies to the surface threefold compared to 50 \% glycerol, while
   decreasing whole-slide coefficient of variation to 5.9 \%. For the two
   best slides, improvements were made for both the limit of detection
   (1.6x and 5.9x, respectively) and the quantification range (1.2x and
   2.1x, respectively). The additive mixtures identified here thus help
   improve assay reproducibility and performance, and might be beneficial
   to all types of microarrays that suffer from evaporation of the printing
   buffers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on precoding design for sum-rate maximization while
   considering the effects of residual self-interference for multiuser
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) full-duplex (FD) systems. The
   problem formulation leads to a nonconvex matrix-variable optimization
   problem, where we develop two efficient sum-rate maximization algorithms
   using sequential convex programming (SCP), namely, the difference of
   convex functions (DC)-based and the sequential convex approximations for
   matrix-variable programming (SCAMP) algorithms. In addition, we derive
   the achievable sum rate under the effect of residual self-interference.
   Simulation results show that, even in cases of high self-interference
   and high estimation error, the SCAMP algorithm provides approximately
   20\%-30\% sum-rate improvements over both conventional optimized
   half-duplex (HD) transmission and the existing state-of-the-art FD
   algorithm in a wide range of scenarios. Finally, the convergence results
   indicate that the DC-based algorithm tends to initially give the best
   performance; however, at convergence, the SCAMP algorithm tends to
   significantly outperform the other algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{A novel implementation of Dynamic Linear Bayesian Models (DLBM), using

   that of traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) and more recent
   artificial neural network (ANN) based models. Model performance was
   ranked DLBM-DWR > DLBM-VCR > MLR > ANN for both annual hydrograph
   modeling and 1-, 2-, and 3-day lead forecasting, indicating that the DWR
   and VCR algorithms, operating in a DLBM framework, represent promising

Abstract = {{We consider the power allocation and relay selection for rate
   maximization in a two-path amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network with
   inter-relay interference (IRI) consideration. We first investigate the
   power allocation with only a pair of relays under both the individual
   and global power constraints. To find the global optimum solution to
   this nonconvex problem, we develop a three-step approach using the
   rate-profiling technique together with a reformulation of the sum-rate
   maximization problem as a set of power-minimization geometric
   programming problems (GPPs). For reduced complexity, we further convert
   the optimization problem into a set of GPPs in a single-step by using a
   high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio approximation. Next, we
   consider the relay pair selection and propose an algorithm in which the
   achievable rate of each pair of relays with the proposed power
   allocation is compared. This selection criterion outperforms the
   conventional selection scheme in terms of the achievable rate. We
   further propose two low-complexity selection criteria for low and
   moderate IRI. For moderate IRI, the ratio of the source-relay and
   relay-destination channel power product to the square of inter-relay
   channel power can be used for relay selection to achieve a performance
   close to that of the selection based on the proposed power allocation.}},

Abstract = {{The ideal strength of methane hydrate and ice I-h was investigated and
   quantified from first-principles calculations. Using density functional
   theory, methane hydrate was studied under uniaxial, triaxial, and shear
   deformation modes, and the uniaxial deformation of ice I-h was
   considered for comparison. The resulting ideal strength was found, and
   the structural evolution in terms of bond lengths, bond angles, elastic
   moduli, and Poisson ratio was analyzed throughout the deformation. It
   was found that methane hydrate displays brittle behavior in terms of its
   strength and has no dominant slip system. Ice I-h exhibited a higher
   ideal uniaxial strength compared to the hydrate by deviating from the
   perfect tetrahedral arrangement of its water molecules. Under uniaxial
   tension, both structures maintain their transverse isotropy and fail at
   a critical hydrogen bond length despite the difference in their strength
   values. Under uniaxial compression, however, the hydrate loses its
   transverse isotropy unlike ice I-h which maintains it. While ice I-h and
   hydrates are similar in many of their physical properties, their ideal
   strength and structural deformation were found to be different. The
   presented new monocrystal mechanical properties and insights are a guide
   to future research in natural and synthetic polycrystalline gas
   hydrates.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{34-45}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The complex sub and supercritical global dynamics of a parametrically
   excited microbeam is investigated with special consideration to chaotic
   motion. More specifically, for a microbeam subject to a time-dependent
   axial load involving a constant value together with a harmonic
   time-variant component, the bifurcation diagrams of Poincare sections of
   the system near critical point are constructed when the amplitude of the
   longitudinal load variations is varied as the control parameter. In
   terms of modelling and simulations, the small-size-dependent potential
   energy of the system is constructed by means of the modified couple
   stress theory and constitutive relations. Continuous expressions for the
   kinetic energy and the energy dissipation mechanism are also
   constructed. A transformation to a high-dimensional reduced-order model
   is performed via use of an assumed-mode method as well as the Galerkin
   scheme. A direct time-integration method is employed to solve the
   reduced-order model. For different cases in the sub and supercritical
   regimes, but close to the critical mean axial force, the bifurcation
   diagrams of Poincare sections are constructed as the amplitude of the
   axial load variations is chosen as the bifurcation parameter. The
   complex dynamical behaviour of the system is analysed more precisely
   through plotting time traces, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), Poincare
   sections and phase-plane diagrams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of growing multiplex networks with intrinsic

   the sum of degrees in both layers. We provide analytical closed-form
   solutions for the joint distributions of fitness and degrees. We also
   derive closed-form expressions for the expected value of the degree as a
   function of fitness. The model alleviates two shortcomings that are
   present in the current models of growing multiplex networks: homogeneity
   of connections, and homogeneity of fitness. In this paper, we posit and
   analyze a growth model that is heterogeneous in both senses. (C) 2015

Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4241-4253}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The free propagation of isobaric flames through aluminum dust clouds is
   investigated in an extensive series of experiments using two facilities
   with different scales. In small-scale laboratory experiments, spherical
   flame propagation occurs in aluminum dust clouds contained within
   30-cm-diameter latex balloons, whereas in large-scale tests, flames
   propagate vertically through unconfined aluminum dust clouds with a
   vertical scale of about 4 m. The balloon experiments are performed with
   suspensions of aluminum powder in oxygen mixed with nitrogen, argon, or
   helium with various concentrations of oxygen and aluminum. It is found
   that stable flame propagation is only observed for aluminum
   concentrations near stoichiometric to rich conditions. Pulsating and
   spiral-like flames are discovered in fuel-lean mixtures, and flames with
   cellular patterns occur in very-fuel-rich suspensions. The burning
   velocities in the stable propagation regime derived from the balloon
   experiments correlate well with data previously obtained with stabilized
   Bunsen-type flames. The flame speed of stable flames is found to be a
   strong function of the heat conductivity of the gas mixture. In
   addition, the oxygen concentration has a strong influence on the flame
   speed for fuel-rich mixtures but dependence is reduced for fuel-lean
   mixtures. In the large-scale experiments, the burning velocity is
   estimated to be about two times larger than for the small-scale
   experiments. The increase in burning velocity is attributed to
   pre-heating of the unburned mixture by radiation from the
   condensed-phase combustion products. The degree of preheating,
   determined with an array of fine thermocouples, is found to be in the
   range of 150-200 K. The propagation of stable flames is discussed in
   light of existing qualitative dust flame models, whereas the pulsating
   flame propagation regime observed is interpreted in terms of the
   thermo-diffusive instability theory developed for high Lewis number
   flames in gases and solid reactive powder mixtures. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Metallic iron used in steel industries is mostly obtained from a direct
   reduction process. The focus of this study is to simulate the furnace of
   the MIDREX technology. MIDREX technology which is the most important
   gas-based direct reduced iron (DRI) process in the world, includes
   reduction, transition and cooling zones. The reduction zone considered
   as a counter current gas-solid reactor produces sponge iron from iron
   ore pellets. The transition zone has sufficient height to isolate the
   reduction zone and cooling zone from each other and the cooling zone
   cools the solid product down to around 50A degrees C. Each zone has a
   system of reactions. Simultaneous mass and energy balances along the
   reduction zone lead to a set of ordinary differential equations with two
   points of boundary conditions. The transitions and cooling zone are
   investigated at the equilibrium condition leading to a set of algebraic
   equations. By solving these systems of equations, we determined the
   materials concentration, temperature, and pressure along the furnace.
   Our results are in a good agreement with data reported by Parisi and
   Laborde (2004) for a real MIDREX plant. Using this model, the effect of
   reactor length and cooling gas flow on the metallization and the effect
   of cooling gas flow on the outlet temperature of the solid phase have
   been studied. These new findings can be used to minimize the consumed
   energy.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveSerum urate levels have been associated with risk for and
   progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Urate-related compounds are
   therapeutic candidates in neuroprotective efforts to slow PD
   progression. A urate-elevating agent is currently under investigation as
   a potential disease-modifying strategy in people with PD. However, PD is
   a heterogeneous disorder, and genetic variation may explain divergence
   in disease severity and progression.
   MethodsWe conducted a genome-wide association study to identify gene
   variant x serum urate interaction effects on the striatal
   I-123-ioflupane (DaTscan) binding ratio measured using single photon
   emission computed tomography in patients with possible PD from the
   Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n = 360). Follow-up
   analyses were conducted to assess gene variant x serum urate interaction
   effects on magnetic resonance imaging-derived regional brain volumes and
   clinical status. We then attempted to replicate our primary analysis in
   patients who entered the Parkinson Research Examination of CEP-1347
   Trial (PRECEPT) with a clinical diagnosis of PD (n = 349).
   ResultsRs1109303 (T>G) variant within the INPP5K gene on chromosome
   17p13.3 demonstrated a genome-wide significant interaction with serum
   urate level to predict striatal dopamine transporter density among all
   PPMI participants (n = 359) with possible PD (p = 2.01 x 10(-8); after
   excluding participants with SWEDD {[}scan without evidence of
   dopaminergic deficit]: p = 1.12 x 10(-9); n = 316). Independent of
   striatal dopamine transporter density, similar effects on brain atrophy,
   bradykinesia, anxiety, and depression were observed. No effect was
   present in the PRECEPT sample at baseline; however, in non-SWEDD PD
   participants in PRECEPT (n = 309), we observed a significant
   longitudinal genotype x serum urate interaction effect, consistent in
   direction with the PPMI sample, on progression of striatal dopamine
   transporter density over the 22-month follow-up.
   InterpretationGenetic profile combined with serum urate level can be
   used to predict disease severity and potential disease progression in
   patients with PD. These results may be relevant to therapeutic efforts
   targeting the urate pathway. Ann Neurol 2015;78:Ann Neurol

Abstract = {{Characterization of distribution and arrangement of filler particles in
   polymer composites is of primary importance to understand and maximize
   their mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. An innovative
   procedure that allows reliable and straightforward preparation of
   cross-sections of polymer composites with the use of mechanical
   polishing, ion beam etching and soft gaseous etching is presented in
   this paper. Because of the inherent difference between the organic
   amorphous matrix and the inorganic crystalline nature of composite
   fillers, the removal of matrix layers at the surface of the
   cross-section at the expense of the inorganic materials allowed
   characterizing the composite filler particles structure and distribution
   over the surface. Since beam broadening did not occur before the beam
   hit the nanoparticles, high-resolution imaging in the scanning electron
   microscope was possible and true dimensions and orientation of the
   particles were observed. This provided more flexibility in selecting the
   primary beam voltage; especially, the use of low beam energy greatly
   improved the image contrast and reduced charging effects resulting from
   the primary electron beam bombardment. It was shown that only polymers
   with a carbonated main chain could be etched selectively by the gaseous
   etching process.
   Lay Description Since the invention of polymers, several tens of years
   ago, they have been involved in lots of applications in the everyday
   life, the main one being the plastic industry which permitted replacing
   wood and metal based objects by more light weighted plastic objects,
   more easily shaped than metals and wood. Depending on their use, they
   provide better mechanical behaviors combined to a better corrosion
   resistance which greatly improved the lifetime of such objects. Later,
   their mechanical properties and more importantly, their electrical
   conductivity were enhanced by adding small particles of harder materials
   leading to the development of polymer composites, or nanocomposites when
   the filler particles were nanometer sized. These provide a mesh of hard
   and/or conductive material which is filled with the polymer. To
   understand the impact of these particles, it is necessary to know
   exactly how they are distributed inside the polymer and how they
   interact with each other, especially for electrical conductivity
   purposes. Optical microscopes are generally used to image the
   distribution of these particles but scanning electron microscopes (SEM)
   are more suited when nanoparticles are used. In this technique, the
   polymer surface is bombarded with electrons extracted from a sharp metal
   tip. These electrons interacts with the atoms of the matter below the
   specimen surface and give rise to the emission of several electronic
   signals which are collected by the detectors of the SEM. These signals
   are used to reconstruct an image of the specimen surface with permits to
   see smaller details than with the optical microscope. Generally, the
   specimen is fractured at very low temperature to provide a way to see
   the structure of the composite inside the sample. However, certain types
   of polymer composites are difficult to fracture due to the different
   materials that are part of its composition. The work reported here
   describes a new technique to produce high quality cross sections of
   polymer nanocomposites based on hand polishing followed by ion polishing
   (using ions instead of bulk materials) and surface etching with a
   corrosive gas. The use of a powerful SEM applied to such cross-sections
   permitted to obtain images that gave an overview of the whole material
   as close as possible of the true microstructure. However, it was shown
   that only polymers composed mainly of carbon bonds could be etched
   selectively by the etching process with the corrosive gas and provide
   such high quality cross-sections.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in low-cost diagnostic devices has recently gained attention,
   in part due to the rising cost of healthcare and the need to serve
   populations in resource-limited settings. A major challenge in the
   development of such devices is the need for hydrophobic barriers to
   contain polar bio-fluid analytes. Key approaches in lowering the cost in
   diagnostics have centered on (i) development of low-cost fabrication
   techniques/processes, (ii) use of affordable materials, or, (iii)
   minimizing the need for high-tech tools. This communication describes a
   simple, low-cost, adaptable, and portable method for patterning paper
   and subsequent use of the patterned paper in diagnostic tests. Our
   approach generates hydrophobic regions using a ball-point pen filled
   with a hydrophobizing molecule suspended in a solvent carrier. An empty
   ball-point pen was filled with a solution of trichloro perfluoroalkyl
   silane in hexanes (or hexadecane), and the pen used to draw lines on
   Whatman (R) chromatography 1 paper. The drawn regions defined the test
   zones since the trichloro silane reacts with the paper to give a
   hydrophobic barrier. The formation of the hydrophobic barriers is
   reaction kinetic and diffusion-limited, ensuring well defined narrow
   barriers. We performed colorimetric glucose assays and enzyme-linked
   immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) using the created test zones. To
   demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we fabricated multiple
   devices on a single piece of paper and demonstrated the reproducibility
   of assays on these devices. The overall cost of devices fabricated by
   drawing are relatively lower (<US \$0.001 per device) than those derived
   from wax-printing (US\$0.05-0.003) or other approaches. (C) 2015

   a classic ski rental problem, and propose a constrained version with two
   statistics mu(B)- and q(B+), the expected length of short stops and the
   probability of long stops. We develop two online algorithms, a
   suboptimal closed-form algorithm and an optimal numerical solution, that
   combine the best of the well-known deterministic and randomized schemes
   to minimize the worst case competitive ratio. We demonstrate the
   algorithms perform better than existing solutions in terms of both worst

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An algorithmic framework that identifies irrelevant data (i.e., data
   that may be ignored without any loss of optimality) at agents of a
   sequential team is presented. This framework relies on capturing the
   properties of a sequential team that do not depend on the specifics of
   state spaces, the probability law, the system dynamics, or the cost
   functions. To capture these properties the notion of a team form is
   developed. A team form is then modeled as a directed acyclic graph and
   irrelevant data is identified using D-separation properties of specific
   subsets of nodes in the graph. This framework provides an algorithmic

Abstract = {{For more than four decades, tannins extracted from renewable resources
   have been used to protect steam boilers at levels significantly above
   ASME guidelines. Using tanninbased (green) corrosion inhibitors reduces
   water and energy consumption, greenhouse gases emissions, and
   contaminants in effluent wastewaters, while reducing the environmental
   footprint of industrial processes. The surface adsorptive and corrosion
   protective properties of a commercial tannin-based corrosion inhibitor
   (TG 3300) for mild steel were investigated in an alkaline environment
   using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, open
   circuit potential, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The
   results showed the formation of an effective and stable tannin-based
   protective layer on mild steel within the first 5 min to 15 min of
   adsorption. It was found that adsorption of TG 3300 on mild steel can be
   well described by the Langmuir isotherm. Highly negative values of
   apparent Gibbs free energy of adsorption (Delta G(ads) = -47.36 kJ/mol),
   indicate a spontaneous and strong adsorption of TG 3300 onto the mild
   steel surface. The results suggest the formation of a TG 3300 protective
   layer on mild steel, where the highest value of inhibition efficiency
   was 85\% under the applied experimental conditions.}},

Title = {{A hybrid method based on linear programming and variable neighborhood

Abstract = {{Production scheduling of open-pit mines is an important problem arising
   in surface mine planning as it determines the raw materials to be
   produced yearly over the life of the mine, assesses the value of the
   mine, and contributes to the sustainable utilization of mineral
   resources. Finding the optimal schedule is a complex task, involving
   large data sets and multiple constraints. This paper introduces a
   two-phase hybrid solution method. The first phase relies on solving a
   series of linear programming problems to generate an initial solution.
   In the second phase, a variable neighborhood descent procedure is
   applied to improve the solution. Upper bounds provided by CPLEX are used
   to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. Its performance is
   also assessed by comparing it to recent solution methods proposed in the
   literature and to an alternate method implemented in commercial mine
   planning software commonly used by professional mine planners. The
   results of these computational experiments indicate the efficiency of
   the proposed method and its superiority over the other methods. It finds
   excellent solutions (within less than 3.2 \% of optimality on average)
   for large instances of the problem in a few seconds up to a few minutes.
   It also provides new best-known solutions for benchmark instances from
   the literature, and it can solve instances recently-published algorithms
   have found intractable.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the impulsive-dynamics formulation, this article presents the
   analysis of different strategies to regulate the energy dissipation at
   the heel-strike event in the context of human locomotion. For this
   purpose, a seven-link 2D human-like multibody model based on
   anthropometric data is used. The model captures the most relevant
   dynamic and energetic aspects of the heel-strike event in the sagittal
   plane. The pre-impact mechanical state of the system, around which the
   analysis of the heel impact contribution to energy dissipation is
   performed, is defined based on published data. In the context of the
   proposed impulsive-dynamics framework, different realistic strategies
   that the subject can apply to modify the impact dynamics are proposed
   and analyzed, namely, the trailing ankle push-off, the torso
   configuration and the degree of joint blocking in the colliding leg.
   Detailed numerical analysis and discussions are presented to quantify
   the effects of the mentioned strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to develop and quantitatively assess
   whether fusion of EEG and MEG (MEEG) data within the maximum entropy on
   the mean (MEM) framework increases the spatial accuracy of source
   localization, by yielding better recovery of the spatial extent and
   propagation pathway of the underlying generators of inter-ictal
   epileptic discharges (IEDs). The key element in this study is the
   integration of the complementary information from EEG and MEG data
   within the MEM framework. MEEG was compared with EEG and MEG when
   localizing single transient IEDs. The fusion approach was evaluated
   using realistic simulation models involving one or two spatially
   extended sources mimicking propagation patterns of IEDs. We also
   assessed the impact of the number of EEG electrodes required for an
   efficient EEG-MEG fusion. MEM was compared with minimum norm estimate,
   dynamic statistical parametric mapping, and standardized low-resolution
   electromagnetic tomography. The fusion approach was finally assessed on
   real epileptic data recorded from two patients showing IEDs
   simultaneously in EEG and MEG. Overall the localization of MEEG data
   using MEM provided better recovery of the source spatial extent, more
   sensitivity to the source depth and more accurate detection of the onset
   and propagation of IEDs than EEG or MEG alone. MEM was more accurate
   than the other methods. MEEG proved more robust than EEG and MEG for
   single IED localization in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. We also
   showed that only few EEG electrodes are required to bring additional
   relevant information to MEG during MEM fusion.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical, topographical, and morphological properties of
   thermally-prepared Ir-x-Ru1-x-oxide coatings of various compositions (0
   < x 1), formed on a Ti metal substrate, were investigated for their
   potential application as supercapacitor (SC) electrodes employing
   scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical techniques of cyclic
   voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling, and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy. A current state-of-the-art pure ruthenium oxide
   (RuO2) coating showed relatively low performance compared to other
   bimetallic IrxRu1-x-oxide coatings operated under the same experimental
   conditions. An electrochemically-activated Ir0.4Ru0.6-oxide coating
   yielded the highest capacitance value (85 mF cm(-2)). Prolonged
   electrochemical cycling of the Ir/Ru-oxide coatings in a corrosive
   phosphate-buffered saline pH=7.4, performed within an extreme potential
   window of 5V, revealed an excellent stability of the coatings. In
   addition, this cycling procedure enabled a significant increase in
   capacitance for all coating compositions. It was shown that the areal
   capacitance (C-GA) of these coatings is strongly dependent upon the
   nature of the components of which the metal oxide is composed. The
   addition of IrO2 to RuO2 improved the stability and capacitive
   performance of the thermally-prepared Ir-Ru-oxide coatings.}},

Abstract = {{We present the design of a flexible multilayer circuit board for use in
   a custom-built microwave system for breast health monitoring. The
   flexible circuit features both an integrated solid-state switching
   network and 16 wideband antennas, which transmit short-duration pulses
   into the breast tissues and receive the backscattered responses. By
   integrating the switching matrix and the antenna array on the same
   substrate, we reduce the overall cost and size of the system in
   comparison with previously demonstrated systems in the literature. We
   characterize the performance of the flexible circuit board using our
   clinically tested experimental system and demonstrate its functionality
   through successful imaging of dielectrically realistic breast phantoms
   that simulate the presence of a tumor. This represents a step toward a
   more patient-friendly, compact, cost-effective, and wearable design in
   contrast to previous systems in the literature that required a clinical
   table or used bulky rigid antenna housings and electromechanical
   switching networks.}},

Abstract = {{The thermo-mechanical nonlinear dynamics of an axially moving beam with
   coupled longitudinal and transverse displacements subjected to a
   distributed harmonic external force is numerically investigated. This
   includes a case where the system is tuned to a three-to-one internal
   resonance between the first two transverse modes and a case where it is
   not is considered. Two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations
   for the longitudinal and transverse motions are obtained using
   Hamilton's principle and constitutive relations, as well as taking into
   account the thermal effects. The Galerkin method is then used to
   discretize these equations into a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations. Two different techniques are employed to solve
   the resulting equations; the pseudo-arclength continuation method and
   direct time integration to investigate the periodic vibrations and the
   global dynamics of the system, respectively. The effect of different
   parameters on the dynamics of the system is investigated through the
   frequency-response curves of the system and the bifurcation diagrams of
   Poincare maps. Furthermore, time histories, phase-plane portraits, and
   fast Fourier transforms are presented for a few different system
   parameter sets. It is illustrated that the system shows a broad variety
   of rich dynamics, depending on system parameters and the temperature
   rise.}},

Title = {{Free energy of the edge of an open lipid bilayer based on the

Abstract = {{Lipid bilayers are the fundamental constituents of the walls of most
   living cells and lipid vesicles, giving them shape and compartment. The
   formation and growing of pores in a lipid bilayer have attracted
   considerable attention from an energetic point of view in recent years.
   Such pores permit targeted delivery of drugs and genes to the cell, and
   regulate the concentration of various molecules within the cell. The
   formation of such pores is caused by various reasons such as changes in
   cell environment, mechanical stress or thermal fluctuations.
   Understanding the energy and elastic behaviour of a lipid-bilayer edge
   is crucial for controlling the formation and growth of such pores. In
   the present work, the interactions in the molecular level are used to
   obtain the free energy of the edge of an open lipid bilayer. The
   resulted free-energy density includes terms associated with flexural and
   torsional energies of the edge, in addition to a line-tension
   contribution. The line tension, elastic moduli, and spontaneous normal
   and geodesic curvatures of the edge are obtained as functions of
   molecular distribution, molecular dimensions, cutoff distance, and the
   interaction strength. These parameters are further analyzed by
   implementing a soft-core interaction potential in the microphysical
   model. The dependence of the elastic free-energy of the edge to the size
   of the pore is reinvestigated through an illustrative example, and the
   results are found to be in agreement with the previous observations. (C)

Abstract = {{Arsenic mobilized during ore processing necessitates its effective
   removal from process effluents and disposal in environmentally stable
   tailings. The most common method to accomplish this involves
   co-precipitation with excess ferric iron during lime neutralization. The
   precipitates produced are stable under oxic conditions. This may not be
   true, however, under sub-oxic or anoxic conditions. In this context, the
   potential stabilizing role of ferrous iron on arsenic removal/retention
   becomes important. As such, this work investigates the removal and redox
   stability of arsenic with ferrous, ferric and mixtures of both. The
   stability of produced solids is monitored in terms of arsenic release
   over time. It was found that ferrous was very effective for arsenic (V)
   removal with Fe(II)/As(V) = 4, reducing its concentration down to <15
   ppb via the apparent formation of ferrous arsenate. The presence of
   Fe(II) seemed to favor an oxidation path toward goethite (and possibly
   scorodite) formation in the aged bench-scale tailings. When pH and E-h
   were regularly adjusted with lime and sulfite or sulfide, slightly
   higher arsenic amounts were released (1-5 mg L-1); ferrous again was
   found to oxidize. Hence, it is concluded that Fe(II)/Fe(III)/As(V)
   co-precipitates are quite robust against incidental reducing agent
   exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{83-96}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The ballistic response of suspensions of solid particles (cornstarch,
   silicon carbide, and silicon dioxide) in a liquid (ethylene glycol) is
   experimentally investigated. Some of the suspensions are at sufficient
   volume fraction to exhibit shear-thickening behaviour, while the others
   are Newtonian or mildly shear-thinning. The response of neat (liquid)
   ethylene glycol is also studied. Capsules containing the suspensions are
   impacted with a chisel-nosed fragment-simulating projectiles at
   velocities between 200 and 700 m/s. The residual projectile velocity
   upon exit from the capsule is measured via direct videography. The
   results are analysed using a number of different energy-based and
   momentum-based penetration models. A momentum-based model that
   normalizes the effect of the density of the suspension is seen to
   perform the best in terms of collapsing the results onto a single curve
   for the liquid and non-shear thickening suspensions. Only shear
   thickening suspensions with particles having sufficient strength (SiO2
   and SiC) show significant deviation from hydrodynamic-dominated
   response, resulting in significant velocity decrements in the projectile
   attributable to the shear strength of the suspensions. These shear
   strength effects diminish as the projectile velocity increases,
   suggesting that the strength of the solid material in the interparticle
   contacts is overcome by the impact-generated stresses. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Seamless integration of functional nanomaterials on paper can boost the
   functionality of paper-based flexible sensors and electronics. In this
   paper, we report the systematic study of a low-cost hydrothermal process
   for growing zinc oxide nanowires (ZnO NWs) on cellulose paper
   substrates. To control the competition between homogeneous and
   heterogeneous nucleation and obtain ZnO NWs with superior morphology and
   high growth efficiency, we tune the critical growth parameters including
   temperature, assistant chemicals, and seeding layer. We experimentally
   confirm the necessity of ammonium hydroxide as assistant chemical in the
   growth solution, and achieve a condition that generates the highest
   weight growth percentage of 40\% in the tested range. We quantify the
   weight growth percentage of ZnO NWs over growth time, measure the
   electrical resistance of the ZnO-NW paper, and eventually establish an
   experimental guideline for preparing ZnO-NW paper with desired
   electrical property. To demonstrate potential applications of the ZnO-NW
   paper, we use the obtained ZnO-NW paper for sensing of ultraviolet light
   and mechanical touch. This paper provides experimental insights into
   hydrothermal growth of ZnO NWs on paper, and could further inspire novel
   utilization of ZnO-NW paper for flexible sensors and electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Engineers have always had to deal with complex challenges. However, a
   profound change has occurred over the last two decades with a
   realization of the need to transition from a focus on technical issues
   to sustainability problems that require an integrated, adaptive and
   participatory approach. Such an engineering approach does not only
   necessitate new methods and tools, but also the consideration of
   epistemology to deal with different kinds of knowledge and high
   uncertainties. The concept of paradigms can support the case-specific
   analysis of concrete solution strategies based upon an understanding of
   the epistemological dimension of sustainability issues. A systematic and
   integrated discussion of paradigms and their interactions in engineering
   practice is currently lacking in the scientific literature. This paper
   examines the role of paradigms in engineering practice and presents a
   system science approach for the analysis of paradigms. A case study on
   sustainable flood management and a literature analysis are provided to
   show the relevance of multiple paradigms in sustainable development
   issues. Engineers should be aware of paradigms and their respective
   application context, as well as the particular role of the ``community
   involvement{''} paradigm for sustainable development. We propose an
   iterative learning approach to continuously deepen students'
   understanding of participatory processes and develop their ability to
   facilitate stakeholder processes. An overview and some reflections on
   the experiences of the authors in the teaching of these new paradigms at
   McGill University, Canada, and the University of Osnabrueck, Germany,
   are provided. In particular, group model building exercises were found
   to provide students with important experiences regarding stakeholder
   interaction in the safe space of the classroom. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, effects of some of the foot modelling assumptions on the
   ankle kinematics and dynamics are investigated based on the experimental
   data. For the kinematics analysis, the appropriateness of the stationary
   axis of rotation of the human ankle flexion is examined. Moreover, an
   interpolated function which is capable of predicting the directional
   changes of this axis is proposed. For the dynamics analysis, two main
   modelling assumptions of the number of the foot segments and the
   dimension of the foot model are the subject of the study. To this end,
   the ankle joint torque and power are selected as the comparison
   indicators and inverse dynamics analyses are carried out. The analyses
   show that the number of segments of the foot model does not have a
   considerable effect on the calculated ankle joint torque. On the other
   hand, the calculated ankle power is highly affected by both of the
   segmentation and the dimension of the foot model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This work aims to investigate the effect of polyelectrolyte complexation
   (PEC) on the stability of proteinalginate hydrogels in simulated
   gastrointestinal fluids. The properties of two types of hydrogels based
   on pea protein isolates (PPI) and on canola protein isolates (CPI) were
   compared. The molecular structure of hydrogels was assessed by FTIR and
   their thermal stability was tested by DSC and TGA. The swelling capacity
   of hydrogels was tested in distilled water, simulated gastric fluid
   (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) without enzymes. CPI beads
   showed higher swelling capacity than PPI beads in all swelling media. In
   SIF, relatively higher swelling, an increase in volume and partial
   degradation were observed for all hydrogel beads. In addition, the
   swelling of beads in SIF was found to be dependent on PEC with chitosan.
   Moreover, degradation tests in SGF and SIF media with enzymes were
   performed to assess the effect of PEC on the stability of hydrogels. The
   results indicated that PEC had no influence on the stability of
   hydrogels in SGF but significantly delayed the degradation of hydrogel
   under SIF conditions. These findings suggest that PEC could be utilized
   to modify protein-alginate hydrogels to create matrices for prolonged
   release applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Enzyme-catalyzed synthesis and kinetics of ultrasonic-assisted biodiesel
   production from waste tallow}},
Journal = {{ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The use of ultrasonic processing was evaluated for its ability to
   achieve adequate mixing while providing sufficient activation energy for
   the enzymatic transesterification of waste tallow. The effects of
   ultrasonic parameters (amplitude, cycle and pulse) and major reaction
   factors (molar ratio and enzyme concentration) on the reaction kinetics
   of biodiesel generation from waste tallow bio-catalyzed by immobilized
   lipase {[}Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB)] were investigated. Three
   sets of experiments namely A, B, and C were conducted. In experiment set
   A, two factors (ultrasonic amplitude and cycle) were investigated at
   three levels; in experiment set B, two factors (molar ratio and enzyme
   concentration) were examined at three levels; and in experiment set C,
   two factors (ultrasonic amplitude and reaction time) were investigated
   at five levels. A Ping Pong Bi Bi kinetic model approach was employed to
   study the effect of ultrasonic amplitude on the enzymatic
   transesterification. Kinetic constants of transesterification reaction
   were determined at different ultrasonic amplitudes (30\%, 35\%, 40\%,
   45\%, and 50\%) and enzyme concentrations (4, 6, and 8 wt.\% of fat) at
   constant molar ratio (fat:methanol); 1:6, and ultrasonic cycle; 5 Hz.
   Optimal conditions for ultrasound-assisted biodiesel production from
   waste tallow were fat:methanol molar ratio, 1:4; catalyst level 6\% (w/w
   of fat); reaction time, 20 min (30 times less than conventional batch
   processes); ultrasonic amplitude 40\% at 5 Hz. The kinetic model results
   revealed interesting features of ultrasound assisted enzyme-catalyzed
   transesterification (as compared to conventional system): at ultrasonic
   amplitude 40\%, the reaction activities within the system seemed to be
   steady after 20 min which means the reaction could proceed with or
   without ultrasonic mixing. Reversed phase high performance liquid
   chromatography indicated the biodiesel yield to be 85.6 0.08\%. (C) 2015

Volume = {{353}},

Abstract = {{The majority of studies performed on the formation of surface features
   by femtosecond laser radiation focuses on single scan procedures, i.e.
   manipulating the laser beam once over the target area to fabricate
   different surface topographies. In this work, the effect of scanning
   stainless steel 304 multiple times with femtosecond laser pulses is
   thoroughly investigated over a wide range of fluences. The resultant
   laser-induced surface topographies can be categorized into two different
   regimes. In the low fluence regime (F-Sigma line,F-max < 130 J/cm(2)),
   ellipsoidal cones (randomly distributed surface protrusions covered by
   several layers of nanoparticles) are formed. Based on chemical,
   crystallographic, and topographical analyses, we conclude that these
   ellipsoidal cones are composed of unablated steel whose conical geometry
   offers a significant degree of fluence reduction (35-52\%). Therefore,
   the rest of the irradiated area is preferentially ablated at a higher
   rate than the ellipsoidal cones. The second, or high fluence regime
   (F-Sigma line,F-max < 130 J/cm(2)) consists of laser-induced surface
   patterns such as columnar and chaotic structures. Here, the surface
   topography showed little to no change even when the target was scanned
   repeatedly. This is in contrast to the ellipsoidal cones, which evolve
   and grow continuously as more laser passes are applied. (C) 2015

Title = {{A hybrid Taylor-Galerkin variational multi-scale stabilization method
   for the level set equation}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{192-205}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{A stabilized finite element formulation of the level set equation is
   proposed for the numerical simulation of water droplet dynamics for
   in-flight ice accretion problems. The variational multi-scale and
   Taylor-Galerkin approaches are coupled such that the temporal derivative
   in the weak Galerkin formulation is replaced with a Taylor series
   expansion improving the temporal accuracy of the scheme. The variational
   multi-scale approach is then applied to the semi-discrete equation,
   allowing the stabilization terms to appear naturally. Taylor series
   expansions up to the fourth order have been studied in terms of accuracy
   and convergence rates. A second order implicit expansion was found to
   provide a good trade-off between accuracy and computational cost when
   compared to a fourth order implicit expansion. Validation is done
   through a number of benchmark cases considering droplet stretching and
   high-speed advection. Results indicate good mass conservation
   characteristics compared to other methods available in the literature.

Abstract = {{This work uses Ginzburg-Landau theory derived from a recent structural
   phase-field-crystal model of binary alloys developed by the authors to
   study the roles of concentration, temperature, and pressure on the

   the main contribution to the change in anisotropy with concentration
   arises from a change in preferred crystallographic orientation
   controlled by solute-dependent changes in the two-point density
   correlation function of a binary alloy, a mechanism that leads to such
   phenomena as solute-induced elastic strain and dislocation-assisted
   solute clustering. Our results are consistent with experimental
   observations in recent studies by Rappaz et al. {[}J. Fife, P. Di

Abstract = {{Aircraft holding around busy airports may be requested to sustain as
   much as 45min of icing before landing or being diverted to another
   airport. In this paper, a three-dimensional mesh deformation scheme,
   based on a structural frame analogy, is proposed for the numerical
   simulation of ice accretion during extended exposure to adverse weather
   conditions. The goal is to provide an approach that is robust and
   efficient enough to delay or altogether avoid re-meshing while
   preserving (enforcing) nearly orthogonal elements at the highly
   distorted ice surface. Robustness is achieved by suitably modifying the
   axial and torsional stiffness components of the frame elements in order
   to handle large and irregular grid displacements typical of in-flight
   icing. Computational efficiency is obtained by applying the mesh
   displacement to an automatically selected small subset of the entire
   computational domain. The methodology is validated first in the case of
   deformations typical of fluid-structure interaction problems, including
   wing bending, a helicopter rotor in forward flight, and the twisting of
   a high-lift wing configuration. The approach is then assessed for
   aero-icing on two swept wings and compared against experimental
   measurements where available. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The MgO-P2O5 and CaO-P2O5 systems have been thermodynamically assessed
   based on the available phase diagram and thermodynamic data using the
   Calculation of Phase Diagram (CALPHAD) method. The liquid phase is
   described by the modified quasichemical model with the pair
   approximation, which takes short-range ordering in liquid solution into
   account. The PO43- is considered as the basic building unit of P2O5 in
   the liquid solution since the maximum short-range ordering occurs at the
   M-3(PO4)(2) (M = Mg, Ca) composition. All intermetallic phases are
   treated as stoichiometric compounds and the phase transformations are
   considered. A set of self-consistent model parameters is obtained to
   describe the thermodynamic property of every phase in these two binary
   systems, by which the published phase diagram, enthalpy, entropy, and
   activity data are reproduced well within experimental error limits. The
   present study can be used as a basis for the development of a

Abstract = {{Combining atomistic simulations and continuum modeling, we studied
   dislocation shielding of a nanocrack in monolayer graphene under mode-I
   loading. Different crack-dislocation configurations were constructed and
   the shielding effects on the threshold stress intensity for crack
   propagation were examined. Excellent agreement between simulation
   results and linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) predictions was
   achieved. As the separation between the crack-tip and dislocation, that
   is, r(R), varies (with respect to the crack size a), the shielding
   effect exhibits two different dependences on r(R), scaling as
   1/r(R)(1/2) for r(R)/a << 1 (near-tip), whereas 1/r(R) for r(R)/a >> 1
   (far-field), respectively. Particularly, the far-field 1/r(R) scaling
   was shown to be a direct manifestation of the stress field of
   dislocation in graphene. Our work presents a systematic study of
   nanoscale crack-dislocation interactions in graphene, providing valuable
   information on defect engineering of graphene.}},

Abstract = {{Bead foaming technology with double crystal melting peak structure has
   been recognized as a promising method to produce high-performance
   low-density foams with complex geometries. Polylactide (PLA) bead
   foaming has been of the great interest of researchers due to its origin
   from renewal resources and biodegradability. However, due to the PLA's
   low melt strength and slow crystallization kinetics, the attempts have
   been limited to the manufacturing methods used for expanded polystyrene
   (EPS). In this study, we developed microcellular PLA bead foams with
   double crystal melting peak structure in a large content using a
   lab-scale autoclave system followed by molding of the beads. PLA bead
   foams were produced with expansion ratios and average cell sizes ranging
   from 6 to 31-fold and 6 to 50 mu m, respectively. The high-melting point
   crystals generated during gas-saturation significantly affected the
   expansion ratio and cell density of the PLA bead foams by enhancing the
   PLA's melt strength and promoting cell nucleation around the crystals.
   The tensile properties of the molded EPLA bead foams showed that EPLA
   bead foams with double crystal melting peak can be a promising
   substitute not only for EPS but also for expanded polypropylene (EPP)
   bead foams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the performance of spectral acceleration
   averaged over a period range (Sa(avg)) as an intensity measure (IM) for
   estimating the collapse risk of structures subjected to earthquake
   loading. The performance of Sa(avg) is evaluated using the following
   criteria: efficiency, sufficiency, the availability or ease of
   developing probabilistic seismic hazard information in terms of the IM
   and the variability of collapse risk estimates produced by the IM.
   Comparisons are also made between Sa(avg) and the more traditional IM:
   spectral acceleration at the first-mode period of the structure
   (Sa(T-1)). Though most previous studies have evaluated IMs using a
   relatively limited set of structures, this paper considers nearly 700
   moment-resisting frame and shear wall structures of various heights to
   compare the efficiency and sufficiency of the IMs. The collapse risk
   estimates produced by Sa(avg) and Sa(T-1) are also compared, and the
   variability of the risk estimates is evaluated when different ground
   motion sets are used to assess the structural response. The results of
   this paper suggest that Sa(avg), when computed using an appropriate
   period range, is generally more efficient, more likely to be sufficient
   and provides more stable collapse risk estimates than Sa(T-1). Copyright

Abstract = {{The percolating flow of liquid water in the gas-diffusion layer (GDL) of
   polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) was studied ex situ using a
   simple water-injection experiment. Water was injected into the top of
   the sample so the droplet was free to detach from the bottom, allowing
   for uninterrupted study of the dynamic cycle of droplet appearance,
   growth, and detachment. Although droplets emerged from a single point on
   the GDL, the measured pressure response in the water phase was clearly
   not equivalent to a single needle. The behavior of the system was
   explained by the simultaneous filling and inflating of many menisci,
   resulting in extended periods with no droplet activity at the GDL
   surface, followed by the sudden eruption of a droplet at the
   breakthrough site as all interfaces deflated and their stored water was
   directed toward the droplet. A simple numerical model was presented that
   could qualitatively explain the observed behavior. Tests were performed
   on GDLs, with and without microporous layers (MPLs), and all observed
   behavior could be interpreted in terms of the proposed model. MPLs
   shifted the behavior to a more needlelike behavior which was consistent
   with the MPL reducing the number of invading liquid clusters in the

Abstract = {{Phthalate plasticizers such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) are
   being phased out of many consumer products because of their endocrine
   disrupting properties and their ubiquitous presence in the environment.
   The concerns raised from the use of phthalates have prompted consumers,
   government, and industry to find alternative plasticizers that are safe,
   biodegradable, and have the versatility for multiple commercial
   applications. We examined the toxicogenomic profile of
   mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP, the active metabolite of DEHP), the
   commercial plasticizer diisononyl cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH),
   and three recently proposed plasticizers: 1,4-butanediol dibenzoate
   (BDB), dioctyl succinate (DOS), and dioctyl maleate (DOM), using the
   immortalized TM4 Sertoli cell line. Results of gene expression studies
   revealed that DOS and BDB clustered with control samples while MEHP,
   DINCH and DOM were distributed far away from the control-DOS-BDB
   cluster, as determined by principle component analysis. While no
   significant changes in gene expression were found after treatment with
   BDB and DOS, treatment with MEHP, DINCH and DOM resulted in many
   differentially expressed genes. MEHP upregulated genes downstream of
   PPAR and targeted pathways of cholesterol biosynthesis without
   modulating the expression of PPAR's themselves. DOM upregulated genes
   involved in glutathione stress response, DNA repair, and cholesterol
   biosynthesis. Treatment with DINCH resulted in altered expression of a
   large number of genes involved in major signal transduction pathways
   including ERK/MAPK and Rho signalling. These data suggest DOS and BDB
   may be safer alternatives to DEHP/MEHP than DOM or the commercial
   alternative DINCH.}},

Title = {{Bayesian STSA estimation using masking properties and generalized Gamma
   prior for speech enhancement}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{We consider the estimation of the speech short-time spectral amplitude
   (STSA) using a parametric Bayesian cost function and speech prior
   distribution. First, new schemes are proposed for the estimation of the
   cost function parameters, using an initial estimate of the speech STSA
   along with the noise masking feature of the human auditory system. This
   information is further employed to derive a new technique for the gain
   flooring of the STSA estimator. Next, to achieve better compliance with
   the noisy speech in the estimator's gain function, we take advantage of
   the generalized Gamma distribution in order to model the STSA prior and
   propose an SNR-based scheme for the estimation of its corresponding
   parameters. It is shown that in Bayesian STSA estimators, the
   exploitation of a rough STSA estimate in the parameter selection for the
   cost function and the speech prior leads to more efficient control on
   the gain function values. Performance evaluation in different noisy
   scenarios demonstrates the superiority of the proposed methods over the
   existing parametric STSA estimators in terms of the achieved noise
   reduction and introduced speech distortion.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrate a novel digital signal processing (DSP)
   structure for reduced guard-interval (RGI) OFDM coherent optical
   systems. The proposed concept is based on digitally slicing optical
   channel bandwidth into multiple spectrally disjoint sub-bands which are
   then processed in parallel. Each low bandwidth sub-band has a smaller
   delay-spread compared to a full-band signal. This enables compensation
   of both chromatic dispersion (CD) and polarization mode dispersion using
   a simple timing and one-tap-per-symbol frequency domain equalizer with a
   small cyclic prefix overhead. In terms of the DSP architecture, this
   allows for a highly efficient parallelization of DSP tasks performed
   over the received signal samples by deploying multiple processors
   running at a lower clock rate. It should be noted that this
   parallelization is performed in the frequency domain and it allows for
   flexible optical transceiver schemes. In addition, the resulting optical
   receiver is simplified due to the removal of the CD compensation
   equalizer compared to conventional RGI-OFDM systems. In this paper we
   experimentally demonstrate digital sub-banding of optical bandwidth. We
   test the system performance for different modulation formats (QPSK,
   16QAM and 32QAM) over various transmission distances and optical launch
   powers using a 1.5\% CP overhead in all scenarios. We also compare the
   proposed RGI-OFDM architecture performance against common single carrier
   modulation formats. At the same total data rate and signal bandwidth
   both systems have similar performance and transmission reach whereas the
   proposed method allows for a significant reduction of computational
   complexity due to removal of CD pre/post compensation equalizer. (C)

Title = {{Towards sustainable water governance: Examining water governance issues

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is on multi-loop social learning processes
   required to move towards more sustainable water governance. Multi-loop
   social learning is recognized as a crucial element to decision-making
   involving a process of managing change where the central methodological
   concern is with effectively engaging the necessary participation of
   system members in contributing to the collective knowledge for more
   sustainable policy outcomes. A research framework that provides a deeper
   understanding of the conditions required for the facilitation of
   multi-loop social learning is developed to assess the capacity for
   multi-loop social learning of the Quebec water governance system. This
   research focuses in particular on six watershed management organizations
   and their watershed territories. In total, 41 semi-structured interviews
   were conducted with staff of the watershed management organizations as
   well as with actors and stakeholders associated with three of the six
   studied watershed territories. This study shows that although the
   watershed management organizations have the potential to fulfill a key
   role in facilitating multi-loop social learning, there are still a
   number of challenges that will need to be addressed to achieve this
   potential. Limited capacity and perceived credibility of the watershed
   management organizations and a mismatch between provincial- and
   local-level discourses, as well as a limited participation of a wide
   diversity of actors and stakeholders across different levels and scales,
   are examples of conditions that hinder the facilitation of multi-loop
   social learning in Quebec. Opportunities to overcome some of these key
   challenges include renewing partnerships with stakeholders that have so
   far not been involved by exploring innovative tools for knowledge
   co-production, and accelerating the transition towards a more
   collaborative water governance system through the development of
   required traits and skills of current and future change makers and
   leaders.}},

Title = {{Using noble gas tracers to constrain a groundwater flow model with

Abstract = {{Environmental tracers provide information on groundwater age, recharge
   conditions, and flow processes which can be helpful for evaluating
   groundwater sustainability and vulnerability. Dissolved noble gas data
   have proven particularly useful in mountainous terrain because they can
   be used to determine recharge elevation. However, tracer-derived
   recharge elevations have not been utilized as calibration targets for
   numerical groundwater flow models. Herein, we constrain and calibrate a
   regional groundwater flow model with noble-gas-derived recharge
   elevations for the first time. Tritium and noble gas tracer results
   improved the site conceptual model by identifying a previously uncertain
   contribution of mountain block recharge from the Coast Mountains to an
   alluvial coastal aquifer in humid southwestern British Columbia. The
   revised conceptual model was integrated into a three-dimensional
   numerical groundwater flow model and calibrated to hydraulic head data
   in addition to recharge elevations estimated from noble gas recharge
   temperatures. Recharge elevations proved to be imperative for
   constraining hydraulic conductivity, recharge location, and bedrock
   geometry, and thus minimizing model nonuniqueness. Results indicate that
   45\% of recharge to the aquifer is mountain block recharge. A similar
   match between measured and modeled heads was achieved in a second
   numerical model that excludes the mountain block ( no mountain block
   recharge), demonstrating that hydraulic head data alone are incapable of
   quantifying mountain block recharge. This result has significant
   implications for understanding and managing source water protection in
   recharge areas, potential effects of climate change, the overall water
   budget, and ultimately ensuring groundwater sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{There is a general agreement that the climate change, which is the most
   important challenge facing humanity, is anthropogenic and attributed to
   fossil fuel consumption. Therefore, deploying more renewable energy
   resources is an urgent issue to be addressed. Geothermal refers to
   existing heat energy in deep rock and sedimentary basins. Traditionally,
   geothermal energy has been exploited in places with plentiful hot water
   at relatively shallow depth. Unfortunately, the high exploration and
   drilling costs of boreholes is the main barrier to the commerciality of
   geothermal worldwide. In oil producing countries, such problems can be
   overcome by utilizing oil or gas wells. The current study presents
   thermodynamic and economic analyses of a binary geothermal power
   generation system for commercial electricity generation. Two different
   source temperatures (100 and 120 degrees C) and constant sink
   temperature (29 degrees C) were considered. The optimal working fluid
   and optimal design that improve the performance of the plant are
   determined. For the current costs in Qatar, the economical analysis of 5
   MW geothermal plant shows that the levelized cost of electricity for the
   plant varies from 5.6 to 5.2 cent/kW. Whereas, the payback period of
   such plants lies between 5.8 and 4.8 years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Across the southern Canadian Prairies, annual precipitation is
   relatively low (200-400 mm) and periodic water deficits limit economic
   and environmental productivity. Rapid population growth, economic
   development and climate change have exposed this region to increasing
   vulnerability to hydrologic drought. There is high demand for surface
   water, streamflow from the Rocky Mountains in particular. This paper
   describes the application of dendrohydrology to water resource
   management in this region. Four projects were initiated by the
   sponsoring organizations: a private utility, an urban municipality and
   two federal government agencies. The fact that government and industry
   would initiate and fund tree-ring research indicates that practitioners
   recognize paleohydrology as a legitimate source of technical support for
   water resource planning and management. The major advantage of
   tree-rings as a proxy of annual and seasonal streamflow is that the
   reconstructions exceed the length of gauge records by at least several
   centuries. The extent of our network of 180 tree-ring chronologies,
   spanning AD 549-2013 and 20 of latitude, with a high density of sites in
   the headwaters of the major river basins, enables us to construct large
   ensembles of tree-ring reconstructions as a means of expressing
   uncertainty in the inference of streamflow from tree sings. We
   characterize paleo-droughts in terms of modern analogues, translating
   the tree-ring reconstructions from a paleo-time scale to the time frame
   in which engineers and planners operate. Water resource managers and
   policy analysts have used our paleo-drought scenarios in their various
   forms to inform and assist drought preparedness planning, a
   re-evaluation of surface water apportionment policy and an assessment of
   the reliability of urban water supply systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Mining activities in underground mines could induce fault-slip that
   inflicts devastating damage to mine openings. Thus, enhancing current
   knowledge about fault-slip taking place in underground mines is of
   paramount importance. In this study, static and dynamic analyses are
   performed using mine-wide models encompassing a fault running parallel
   to a steeply dipping, tabular orebody. In the static analysis, modelled
   stopes within the orebody are extracted and backfilled in accordance
   with a sublevel stoping method. Dynamic analyses may be performed,
   depending on the stress states at the end of each mining stage during
   the static analysis, to simulate fault-slip induced by a stress drop
   resulting from asperity shear. Selected seismic source parameters of the
   simulated fault-slip are then computed for each mining stage. The
   relation between D/H (where D is distance between the fault and the
   orebody, and H is height of the mined-out ore) and seismic source
   parameters is examined. It is shown that seismic moment and radiated
   seismic energy correlate well with D/H, thus suggesting that this ratio
   could be used as an indicator of fault-slip potential. On the other
   hand, no noticeable correlation between the maximum slip rate during
   fault-slip and D/H could be ascertained.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of ultrasonic parameters (amplitude, cycle,
   and pulse) and major reaction factors (molar ratio and enzyme
   concentration) on the reaction kinetics of fatty add methyl ester (FAME)
   generation from waste choice white grease (CWG) biocatalyzed by
   immobilized lipase {[}Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB)] were
   investigated. A yield of 98.2\% was attained in 20 min at an ultrasonic
   amplitude (40\%) at 5 kHz, fat/methanol molar ratio (1:4), and catalyst
   level of 6\% (wt/wt of fat). The effect of ultrasonic mixing on the
   reaction kinetic of enzymatic transesterification was investigated using
   a Ping Pong Bi Bi kinetic model approach. Kinetic constants of the
   transesterification reaction were determined at different ultrasonic
   amplitudes (30, 35, 40, 45, and 50\%) and enzyme concentrations (4, 6,
   and 8 wt \% of fat) at a constant molar ratio (fat/methanol) of 1:6 and
   ultrasonic cycle of S kHz. The fitted curves of the kinetic mechanism
   showed a sigmoidal curve as a result of mass-transfer limitations, which
   controlled the process at the beginning of the reaction. The kinetic
   model results also revealed interesting features of ultrasound-assisted
   enzyme-catalyzed transesterification. The kinetic model approach
   described the whole methanolysis process accurately. At the ultrasonic
   amplitude of 40\%, the reaction activities within the system seemed to
   have steadied after 20 min, which means that the reaction could proceed
   with or without ultrasonic mixing.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of populations to rapidly adapt to new environments will
   determine their future in an increasingly human-modified world. Although
   meta-analyses do frequently uncover signatures of local adaptation, they
   also reveal many exceptions. We suggest that particular constraints on
   local adaptation might arise when organisms are exposed to novel
   stressors, such as anthropogenic pollution. To inform this possibility,
   we studied the extent to which guppies (Poecilia reticulata) show local
   adaptation to oil pollution in southern Trinidad. Neutral genetic
   markers revealed that paired populations in oil-polluted versus
   not-polluted habitats diverged independently in two different
   watersheds. Morphometrics revealed some divergence (particularly in head
   shape) between these environments, some of which was parallel between
   rivers. Reciprocal transplant experiments in nature, however, found
   little evidence of local adaptation based on survival and growth.
   Moreover, subsequent laboratory experiments showed that the two
   populations from oil-polluted sites showed only weak local adaptation
   even when compared to guppies from oil-free northern Trinidad. We
   conclude that guppies show little local adaptation to oil pollution,
   which might result from the challenges associated with adaptation to
   particularly stressful environments. It might also reflect genetic drift
   owing to small population sizes and/or high gene flow between
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we focus on the analysis of the end-to-end outage
   probability of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) in a multi-hop,
   block-fading channel. First, we use a Markov chain to model the
   multi-hop system with truncated HARQ type-I (HARQ-I) and derive
   closed-form expressions for the outage probability and throughput; we
   also obtain lower and upper bounds on the energy efficiency of the
   system. Then, we extend the analysis to cover HARQ with packet combining
   where we provide a general formulation of the outage probability; in
   special cases, closed-form expressions for outage probability and
   throughput are obtained. Finally, for a multi-hop system with
   opportunistic routing, we present recursive formulas to obtain outage
   probability and throughput. The expressions we derived allow us to draw
   conclusions about the outage diversity of different multi-hop protocols.
   In particular, we show that the diversity order is improved for
   opportunistic multi-hop system and is linearly increasing with the
   number of allowed transmissions for each packet. Numerical results
   illustrate how the analytical expression can be used to compare various
   multi-hop HARQ transmission strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the characterization of the optimal input and the
   computation of the capacity of additive quadrature Gaussian mixture (GM)
   noise channels under an average power constraint. The considered model
   can be used to represent a wide variety of channels with impulsive
   interference, such as the well-known Bernoulli-Gaussian and Middleton
   class-A impulsive noise channels, as well as multiple-access
   interference channels and cognitive radio channels under imperfect
   sensing. At first, we demonstrate that there exists a unique input
   distribution that achieves the channel capacity, and the
   capacity-achieving input distribution has a uniformly distributed phase.
   By examining the Kuhn-Tucker alignment conditions (KTCs), we further
   show that, if the optimal input amplitude distribution contains an
   infinite number of mass points on a bounded interval, the channel output
   must be Gaussian-distributed. However, by using Bernstein's theorem to
   examine the completely monotonic condition, it is shown that the
   assumption of a Gaussian-distributed output is not valid. As a result,
   there are always a finite number of mass points on any bounded interval
   in the optimal amplitude distribution. In addition, by applying a novel
   bounding technique on the KTC and using the envelop theorem, we
   demonstrate that the optimal amplitude distribution cannot have an
   infinite number of mass points. This gives us the unique solution of the
   optimal input having discrete amplitude with a finite number of mass
   points. Given this discrete nature of the optimal input, we then develop
   a simple method to compute the discrete optimal input and the
   corresponding capacity. Our numerical examples show that, in many cases,
   the capacity-achieving distribution consists of only one or twomass
   points.}},

Abstract = {{Ternary III-nitride based nanowires (NWs) are promising for
   optoelectronic applications by offering advantageous design and control
   over composition, structure, and strain. Atomic-level chemical ordering
   in wurtzite InGaN alloys along the c-plane direction with a 1:1
   periodicity within InGaN/GaN NW heterostructures was investigated by
   scanning transmission electron microscopy. Atomic-numbersensitive
   imaging contrast was used to simultaneously assign the In-rich and
   Ga-rich planes and determine the crystal polarity to differentiate
   unique sublattice sites. The nonrandom occupation of the c-planes in the
   InGaN alloys is confirmed by the occurrence of additional superlattice
   spots in the diffraction pattern within the ternary alloy. Compositional
   modulations in the ordered InGaN was further studied using
   atomic-resolution elemental mapping, outlining the substantial
   In-enrichment. Confirming the preferential site occupation of In-atoms
   provides experimental validation for the previous theoretical model of
   ordered InGaN alloys in bulk epilayers based on differences in surface
   site energy. Therefore, this study strongly suggests that atomic
   ordering in InGaN has a surface energetics-induced origin. Optimization
   of atomic ordering, in particular in III-nitride NW heterostructures,
   could be an alternative design tool toward desirable structural and
   compositional properties for various device applications operating at
   longer visible wavelengths.}},

Abstract = {{The current LED lighting technology relies on the use of a driver to
   convert alternating current (AC) to low-voltage direct current (DC)
   power, a resistive p-GaN contact layer to inject positive charge
   carriers (holes) for blue light emission, and rare-earth doped phosphors
   to down-convert blue photons into green/red light, which have been
   identified as some of the major factors limiting the device efficiency,
   light quality, and cost. Here, we show that multiple-active region
   phosphor-free InGaN nanowire white LEDs connected through a polarization
   engineered tunnel junction can fundamentally address the afore-described
   challenges. Such a p-GaN contact-free LED offers the benefit of carrier
   regeneration, leading to enhanced light intensity and reduced efficiency
   droop. Moreover, through the monolithic integration of p-GaN up and
   p-GaN down nanowire LED structures on the same substrate, we have
   demonstrated, for the first time, AC operated LEDs on a Si platform,
   which can operate efficiently in both polarities (positive and negative)

Abstract = {{A dual-photoelectrode device, consisting of a photoanode and
   photocathode with complementary energy bandgaps, has long been perceived
   as an ideal scheme for achieving high efficiency, unassisted
   solar-driven water splitting. Previously reported 2-photon tandem
   devices, however, generally exhibit an extremely low efficiency
   (<0.1\%), which has been largely limited by the incompatibility between
   the two photoelectrode materials. Here we show that the use of
   metal-nitride nanowire photoelectrodes, together with the scheme of
   parallel illumination by splitting the solar spectrum spatially and
   spectrally, can break the efficiency bottleneck of conventional 2-photon
   tandem devices. We have first investigated a dual-photoelectrode device
   consisting of a GaN nanowire photoanode and an InGaN nanowire
   photocathode, which exhibited an open circuit potential of 1.3 V and
   nearly 20-fold enhancement in the power conversion efficiency under
   visible light illumination (400-600 nm), compared to the individual
   photoelectrodes in 1 mol/L HBr. We have further demonstrated a
   dual-photoelectrode device consisting of parallel-connected
   metal-nitride nanowire photoanodes and a Si/InGaN nanowire photocathode,
   which can perform unassisted, direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion. A
   power conversion efficiency of 2\% was measured under AM1.5G 1 sun
   illumination.}},

Abstract = {{To date, it has remained challenging to realize electrically injected
   light sources in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength range (similar to 200
   nm or shorter), which are important for a broad range of applications,
   including sensing, surface treatment, and photochemical analysis. In
   this Letter, we have demonstrated such a light source with molecular
   beam epitaxially grown aluminum nitride (AIN) nanowires on low cost,
   large area Si substrate. Detailed angle dependent electroluminescence
   studies suggest that, albeit the light is TM polarized, the dominant
   light emission direction is from the nanowire top surface, that is,
   along the c axis, due to the strong light scattering effect. Such an
   efficient surface emitting device was not previously possible using
   conventional c-plane AIN planar structures. The AIN nanowire LEDs
   exhibit an extremely large electrical efficiency (>85\%), which is
   nearly ten times higher than the previously reported AIN planar devices.
   Our detailed studies further suggest that the performance of AIN
   nanowire LEDs is predominantly limited by electron overflow. This study
   provides important insight on the fundamental emission characteristics
   of AIN nanowire LEDs and also offers a viable path emitting near-vacuum
   ultraviolet light source through direct electrical injection. to realize
   an efficient surface emitting near-vacuum ultraviolet light source

Abstract = {{This study examines a closed-loop sanitation system (CLSS) in the ger
   areas (informal peri-urban settlements) of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in
   order to evaluate system feasibility and to identify the future
   prospects of CLSS as an alternative to conventional sanitation and
   drainage options. Results show that the CLSS concept is well understood
   and accepted by users and that services are being scaled up. Over 50 per
   cent of respondents used CLSS technologies during both winter and
   summer, testifying to the potential for scaling up these technologies
   and services. Moreover, all users responded positively in their
   evaluation of the emptying services. Despite some problems and
   challenges, the system proved to be feasible, replicable and acceptable
   in the study area. It is recommended that the entire CLSS approach be
   tested through scientific validation to convince more communities,
   government and other stakeholders about scaling up the system beyond the
   study area for better health, environmental conservation and resource
   recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Atomistic simulations can be used to compute damping from first
   principles and gain unprecedented insights into the mechanisms of
   dissipation. However, the technique is still in its infancy and many
   foundational aspects remain unexplored. As a step toward addressing
   these issues, we present here a comparative study of five different
   methods for estimating damping under isothermal conditions. Classical
   molecular dynamics was used to simulate the fundamental
   longitudinal-mode oscillations of nanowires and nanofilms of silicon and
   nickel at room temperature (300 K) in the canonical ensemble using the
   Nose-Hoover thermostat. In the subresonant regime, damping was
   quantified using the loss tangent and loss factor during steady-state
   harmonic vibration. The quality factor was obtained by analyzing the
   spectrum of thermomechanical noise and also from the Duffing-like
   nonlinearity in the frequency response under harmonic excitation. In
   addition, the nonlinear logarithmic decrement was obtained from the
   Hilbert transform of freely decaying oscillations. We discuss the
   factors that must be considered while selecting simulation parameters,
   establish criteria for convergence and linearity, and highlight the
   relative merits and limitations of each method. {[}2014-0255]}},

Title = {{Mapping cyclist activity and injury risk in a network combining
   smartphone GPS data and bicycle counts}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{132-142}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the modal share of cycling has been growing in North
   American cities. With the increase of cycling, the need of bicycle
   infrastructure and road safety concerns have also raised. Bicycle flows
   are an essential component in safety analysis. The main objective of
   this work is to propose a methodology to estimate and map bicycle
   volumes and cyclist injury risk throughout the entire network of road
   segments and intersections on the island of Montreal, achieved by
   combining smartphone GPS traces and count data. In recent years, methods
   have been proposed to estimate average annual daily bicycle (AADB)
   volume and injury risk estimates at both the intersection and segment
   levels using bicycle counts. However, these works have been limited to
   small samples of locations for which count data is available. In this
   work, a methodology is proposed to combine short- and long-term bicycle
   counts with GPS data to estimate AADB volumes along segments and
   intersections in the entire network. As part of the validation process,
   correlation is observed between AADB values obtained from GPS data and
   AADB values from count data, with R-squared values of 0.7 for signalized
   intersections, 0.58 for non-signalized intersections and between 0.48
   and 0.76 for segments with and without bicycle infrastructure. The
   methodology is also validated through the calibration of safety
   performance functions using both sources of AADB estimates, from counts
   and from GPS data. Using the validated AADB estimates, the factors
   associated with injury risk were identified using data from the entire
   population of intersections and segments throughout Montreal. Bayesian
   injury risk maps are then generated and the concentrations of expected
   injuries and risk at signalized intersections are identified. Signalized
   intersections, which are often located at the intersection of major
   arterials, witness 4 times more injuries and 2.5 times greater risk than
   non-signalized intersections. A similar observation can be made for
   arterials which not only have a higher concentration of injuries but
   also injury rates (risk). On average, streets with cycle tracks have a
   greater concentration of injuries due to greater bicycle volumes,
   however, and in accordance with recent works, the individual risk per
   cyclist is lower, justifying the benefits of cycle tracks. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{During release of vesicular content the resistance of the fusion pore
   sometimes changes rapidly and repeatedly. However, it is not clear why
   the pore `flickers'. Engineered nanopores often rectify, but how
   different factors influence the rectification requires clarification. To
   better understand the ionic `causes' of pore conductivity and its
   changes we simulated ion transport through a short nanopore using
   Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, coupling it to the transport of water
   using Navier-Stokes equations. We extracted the potential,
   concentration, and ion flux profiles. In uniformly charged nanopores the
   voltage bias determines which counter-ion flux dominates, and it is
   carried by the counter-ions of the highest concentration. In unipolar
   nanopores this simple rule breaks down. The dominant counter-ion in the
   charged half is from the adjacent compartment, but the bias determines
   what counter-ion flux is dominant the same ion (regular bias), or a
   different and smaller (reverse bias), and this difference determines the
   level of rectification. In bipolar nanopores the dominant counter-ions
   in each half are from the adjacent compartments, and the total ion
   concentration dips in the middle near the wall. With regular bias the
   total ion concentration peaks in the pore center; the ions that carry
   the current through the nanopore start as counter-ions and their fluxes
   are large. With reverse bias the total concentration dips near the wall
   and in the center, both dominant ion fluxes through the nanopore start
   as co-ions and are very small, whereas those starting as counter-ions do
   not go through. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An operational-transconductance-amplifier (OTA) design for ultra-low
   voltage ultra-low power applications is proposed. The input stage of the
   proposed OTA utilizes a bulk-driven pseudo-differential pair to allow
   minimum supply voltage while achieving a rail-to-rail input range. All
   the transistors in the proposed OTA operate in the subthreshold region.
   Using a novel self-biasing technique to bias the OTA obviates the need
   for extra biasing circuitry and enhances the performance of the OTA. The
   proposed technique ensures the OTA robustness to process variations and
   increases design feasibility under ultra-low-voltage conditions.
   Moreover, the proposed biasing technique significantly improves the
   common-mode and power-supply rejection of the OTA. To further enhance
   the bandwidth and allow the use of smaller compensation capacitors, a
   compensation network based on a damping-factor control circuit is
   exploited. The OTA is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology. Measurement
   results show that the OTA provides a low-frequency gain of 46 dB and
   rail-to-rail input common-mode range with a supply voltage as low as 0.5
   V. The dc gain of the OTA is greater than 42 dB for supply voltage as
   low as 0.35 V. The power dissipation is 182 mu W at V-DD = 0.5 V and 17
   mu W at V-DD = 0.35 V.}},

Abstract = {{A novel real-time pose estimation system is presented for solving the
   visual simultaneous localization and mapping problem using a rigid set
   of central cameras arranged such that there is no overlap in their
   fields-of-view. A new parameterization for point feature position using
   a spherical coordinate update is formulated which isolates system
   parameters dependent on global scale, allowing the shape parameters of
   the system to converge despite the scale remaining uncertain.
   Furthermore, an initialization scheme is proposed from which the
   optimization will converge accurately using only the measurements from
   the cameras at the first time step. The algorithm is implemented and
   verified in experiments with a camera cluster constructed using multiple
   perspective cameras mounted on a multirotor aerial vehicle and augmented
   with tracking markers to collect high-precision ground-truth motion
   measurements from an optical indoor positioning system. The accuracy and
   performance of the proposed pose estimation system are confirmed for
   various motion profiles in both indoor and challenging outdoor
   environments, despite no overlap in the camera fields-of-view.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic design provisions for steel-sheathed cold-formed steel framed
   shear walls, specific to Canada, are not provided in the existing AISI
   S213 Standard ``North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing -
   Lateral Design{''}. A multi-phase approach was adopted in order to
   develop appropriate seismic design provisions for inclusion in the new
   AISI S400 Standard ``North American Standard for Seismic Design of
   Cold-Formed Steel Structural Systems{''}. The approach included the
   extensive displacement based testing and dynamic testing of shear walls,
   the analysis of the test data results, the development and calibration
   of dynamic numerical models in OpenSees, and lastly, the dynamic
   response history analyses of twelve archetype buildings designed for the
   seismic hazard in three cities; Halifax (low seismic), Montreal (medium
   seismic) and Vancouver (high seismic). It is this last phase of the
   study that is documented herein. Fragility curves were developed from
   the buildings' response to 44 scaled ground motion records following a
   method adapted from the FEMA P695 analysis methodology. The results
   showed that the design method is appropriate, including the seismic
   force modification factors of R-d=2 and R-o=1.3. Improvement to the
   predicted seismic response of CFS framed buildings could be forthcoming
   if one were to account for the contribution of the non-structural gypsum
   wall panels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Radar-based microwave imaging has been widely studied for breast cancer
   detection in recent times. Sensing dielectric property differences of
   tissues has been studied over a wide frequency band for this
   application. We design single-and dual-polarization antennas for
   wireless ultrawideband breast cancer detection systems using an
   inhomogeneous multilayer model of the human breast. Antennas made from
   flexible materials are more easily adapted to wearable applications.
   Miniaturized flexible monopole and spiral antennas on a 50-mu m Kapton
   polyimide are designed, using a high-frequency structure simulator, to
   be in contact with biological breast tissues. The proposed antennas are
   designed to operate in a frequency range of 2-4 GHz (with reflection
   coefficient (S-11) below -10 dB). Measurements show that the flexible
   antennas have good impedancematching when in different positions with
   different curvature around the breast. Our miniaturized flexible
   antennas are 20 mm x 20 mm. Furthermore, two flexible conformal 4x4
   ultrawideband antenna arrays (single and dual polarization), in a format
   similar to that of a bra, were developed for a radar-based breast cancer
   detection system. By using a reflector for the arrays, the penetration
   of the propagated electromagnetic waves from the antennas into the
   breast can be improved by factors of 3.3 and 2.6, respectively.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Many benefits can be achieved through the implementation of a Microgrid
   controller, such as minimized cost, reduction in peak power, power
   smoothing, greenhouse gas emission reduction, and increased reliability
   of service. However, most Microgrid controllers found in the literature
   and in the industry optimize a single objective, which either
   exacerbates or does not solve the problems with integrating a high
   penetration of renewable energy. This paper presents a methodology of
   formulating a multiobjective optimization (MOO) so that each objective
   is quantified through valuation functions that can be specific to every
   Microgrid. The proposed approach attains a Pareto-optimal solution by
   directly comparing the quantified valuation functions and solving as if
   it were a single-objective optimization (SOO) problem. Three cases of
   controllers are presented and compared: 1) a base case system with no
   controller; 2) an SOO that optimizes the cost of energy; and 3) an MOO
   that optimizes five identified benefits. Results show that the proposed
   controller can mitigate the negative impacts of volatile generation to
   levels below that of the system load.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1624-1637}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally, the planning of operating reserve has been done in terms
   of capacity and average constant ramping requirements, whereas the newly
   emerging concept of power system flexibility puts emphasis on resources'
   maneuverability, as well as accurately capturing the intra-hourly
   variability and uncertainty resulting from significant penetration of
   renewable power generation. However, the traditional reserve paradigm is
   deemed impeding to the notion of flexibility, whereas there is yet to be
   a proper way of defining power system flexibility. To that end, we
   rethink the fundamental meaning of reserve with respect to the emerging
   concept of flexibility and present a new flexibility modeling framework.
   We characterize flexibility provision and flexibility requirements via
   dynamical envelopes that can reflect the higher order dynamics of power
   system resources and those of variability and uncertainty. We assert
   that flexibility adequacy is directly related to how well the aggregate
   flexibility envelope formed by flexibility resources encloses the
   flexibility requirement envelope and its dynamics over operational
   planning horizons. An optimal flexibility planning problem with
   envelopes is formulated, followed by examples involving unit commitment
   and economic dispatch.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Climate change in recent years has been affecting agriculture and
   especially crop production worldwide. This study analyzes the effect of
   two different climate change scenarios on crop production of an
   experimental site in southern Quebec, Canada. The DSSAT model, which was
   calibrated for years 2008 and 2009, was used to simulate corn growth
   with 30 years of synthetic data for climate scenarios baseline
   (1961-1990), A2 (2040-2069), and B1 (2040-2069). In comparison with the
   baseline scenario, the A2 and B1 scenarios projected a decrease in grain
   and biomass, an increase in crop ET and evaporation, and an early crop
   emergence and maturity dates. Reduction in grain yield of up to 40\% for
   A2 and 24\% for B1 scenarios was observed, which could be attributed to
   water-deficit conditions resulting from decreased rainfall and increase
   in temperature during the growing season. Because drought indices were
   found to be significantly correlated with grain yield and crop water
   stress, it could be used to define the variability of grain yield and
   water stress at the field scale. This study indicates that climate
   change might have a negative effect in terms of corn crop production
   under the given study area. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Bone substitute composite materials with poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide)
   (PLGA) matrices and four different bioactive fillers: CaCO3,
   hydroxyapatite (HA), 4555 Bioglass (R) (45S5 BG), and ICIE4 bioactive
   glass (a lower sodium glass than 45S5 BG) were produced via melt
   blending, extrusion and moulding. The viscoelastic, mechanical and
   thermal properties, and the molecular weight of the matrix were
   measured. Thermogravimetric analysis evaluated the effect of filler
   composition on the thermal degradation of the matrix. Bioactive glasses
   caused premature degradation of the matrix during processing, whereas
   CaCO3 or HA did not. All composites, except those with 4555 BG, had
   similar mechanical strength and were stiffer than PLGA alone in
   compression, whilst all had a lower tensile strength. Dynamic mechanical
   analysis demonstrated an increased storage modulus (E') in the
   composites (other than the 45S5 BG filled PLGA). The effect of water
   uptake and early degradation was investigated by short-term in vitro
   aging in simulated body fluid, which indicated enhanced water uptake
   over the neat polymer; bioactive glass had the greatest water uptake,
   causing matrix plasticization. These results enable a direct comparison
   between bioactive filler type in poly(alpha-hydroxyester) composites,
   and have implications when selecting a composite material for eventual
   application in bone substitution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Constant strain rate compression tests were carried on samples of
   Mg-2Zn-2Nd that had been either: (i) slowly cooled or (ii) solutionized
   and quenched. Peaks in the flow stress/temperature curves were observed,
   indicating that dynamic strain aging (DSA) was taking place at certain
   temperatures and strain rates. This led to the presence of both negative
   as well as high positive strain rate sensitivity (SRS) regions. The
   quenched material displayed a wider range of negative SRS owing to its
   higher Nd solute content. Compression samples of the slowly cooled
   material deformed under positive SRS conditions contained large
   extension and contraction twins. By contrast, samples deformed under
   negative SRS conditions contained fine extension twins located entirely
   within the shear bands. The twin variants that formed in the negative
   SRS sample were characterized by high Schmid factors and required
   accommodation by a combination of basal, prismatic and pyramidal glide.

Abstract = {{The crystallization characteristics of CaF2-CaO-Al2O3 slags with varying
   amounts of SiO2 were experimentally studied. The effects of slag
   crystallization behaviors on the horizontal heat transfer and
   lubrication performance in drawing-ingot-type electroslag remelting
   (ESR) were also evaluated in terms of as-cast ingots surface quality and
   drawing-ingot operation. The results show that increasing SiO2 addition
   from 0 to 6.8 mass pct strongly suppresses the crystallization of ESR
   type CaF2-CaO-Al2O3 slags. The crystallization temperature of the
   studied slags decreases with the increase in SiO2 addition. The liquidus
   temperatures of the slags also show a decreasing trend with increasing
   SiO2 content. In CaF2-CaO-Al2O3-(SiO2) slags, faceted 11CaO center dot
   7Al(2)O(3)center dot CaF2 crystals precipitate first during continuous
   cooling of the slag melts, followed by the formation of CaF2 at lower
   temperatures. 11CaO center dot 7Al(2)O(3)center dot CaF2 was confirmed
   to be the dominant crystalline phase in the studied slags.
   CaF2-CaO-Al2O3 slags with a small amount of SiO2 addition are favorable
   for providing sound lubrication and horizontal heat transfer in mold for
   drawing-ingot-type ESR, which consequently bring the improvement in the
   surface quality of ESR ingot and drawing-ingot operating practice as
   demonstrated by plant trials.}},

Abstract = {{Al deoxidation equilibria in liquid iron over the whole composition
   range from very low Al ({[}pct Al] = 0.0027) to almost pure liquid Al
   were thermodynamically modeled for the first time using the Modified
   Quasichemical Model in the pair approximation for the liquid phase. The
   present modeling is distinguished from previous approaches in many ways.
   First, very strong attractions between metallic components, Fe and Al,
   and non-metallic component, O, were taken into account explicitly in
   terms of Short-Range Ordering. Second, the present thermodynamic
   modeling does not distinguish solvent and solutes among metallic
   components, and the model calculation can be applied from pure liquid Fe
   to pure liquid Al. Therefore, this approach is thermodynamically
   self-consistent, contrary to the previous approaches using interaction
   parameter formalism. Third, the present thermodynamic modeling describes
   an integral Gibbs energy of the liquid alloy in the framework of
   CALPHAD; therefore, it can be further used to develop a multicomponent
   thermodynamic database for liquid steel. Fourth, only a small
   temperature-independent parameter for ternary liquid was enough to
   account for the Al deoxidation over wide concentration (0.0027 < {[}pct
   Al] < 100) and wide temperature range {[}1823 K to 2139 K (1550 A
   degrees C to 1866 A degrees C)]. Gibbs energies of Fe-O and Al-O binary
   liquid solutions at metal-rich region (up to oxide saturation) were
   modeled, and relevant model parameters were optimized. By merging these
   Gibbs energy descriptions with that of Fe-Al binary liquid modeled by
   the same modeling approach, the Gibbs energy of ternary Fe-Al-O solution
   at metal-rich region was obtained along with one small ternary
   parameter. It was shown that the present model successfully reproduced
   all available experimental data for the Al deoxidation equilibria. Limit
   of previously used interaction parameter formalism at high Al
   concentration is discussed.}},

Journal = {{AIAA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2856-2868}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Although there is considerable interest in using wall suction to
   increase boundary-layer stability, stability analyses suggest that
   porous walls are inherently destabilizing. We explore this contradiction
   by performing a spatial linear stability analysis of the asymptotic
   suction boundary layer using a realistic model of wall suction. The
   porous wall is modelled as a layer of rigid, homogeneous, isotropic,
   porous material of small permeability, in which inertial effects may be
   neglected. The porous layer is bounded above by a semi-infinite region
   in which a boundary layer is driven by a constant freestream velocity.
   The wall suction is created by applying a suction pressure to a
   semi-infinite region below the porous layer. Our stability analysis
   takes account of the full coupling between the flowfields in the
   boundary-layer and suction regions, governed by the Navier-Stokes
   equations, and the flow in the porous layer, governed by the
   volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. We find that small amounts of
   wall permeability destabilize the Tollmien-Schlichting wave and cause a
   substantial broadening of the unstable region. As a result, the
   stabilization of boundary layers by wall suction is substantially less
   effective and more expensive than what is predicted by classical
   boundary-layer theory.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},

Abstract = {{`Payments for ecosystem services' (PES) is rapidly becoming a popular
   governance intervention within natural resource management to align
   land-use stewardship to conserve critical ecosystem services while
   simultaneously improving human well-being through the provision of
   incentives. This paper introduces two novel components for refining the
   legitimacy of PES in water resource management. Firstly, we broaden
   consideration of human well-being in PES beyond income effects by
   considering justice as the freedom or capability to `do and be' whatever
   is desired. Secondly, this paper applies social multi-criteria
   evaluation as a decision-support framework to determine the
   acceptability and payment vehicle of PES within a set of alternative
   policy considerations for a complex ecosystem management decision.
   Through both technical and social evaluations of different management
   options against a set of criteria, we highlight the legitimacy that
   different PES designs may have for improving water quality and
   capabilities for well-being. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Subcritical parametric dynamics of microbeams}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{36-48}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to analyse the size-dependent nonlinear
   parametric dynamics of microbeams; the source of parametric excitation
   is a time-dependent longitudinal excitation load. Taking into account
   small-size effects, via the modified couple stress theory, the
   expressions for the potential and kinetic energies of the system are
   developed. A multi-degree-of-freedom discretised system is obtained by
   transforming the continuous model into a reduced-order one via the
   Galerkin scheme. For the system in the subcritical mean axial load
   regime, the parametric response is obtained via two different numerical
   techniques; first one is based on a continuation technique and the
   second one is via a direct time-integration method. A stability analysis
   is also conducted via the Floquet theory. Results for the nonlinear
   parametric response are illustrated in the form of parametric
   frequency-response diagrams, parametric force-response curves, time
   histories, phase-plane portraits, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), and
   Poincare maps. The effect of taking into account the length-scale
   parameter on the parametric response of the system is also highlighted.

Abstract = {{We present a finite-element model of the gerbil middle ear that, using a
   set of baseline parameters based primarily on a priori estimates from
   the literature, generates responses that are comparable with responses
   we measured in vivo using multi-point vibrometry and with those measured
   by other groups. We investigated the similarity of numerous features
   (umbo, pars-flaccida and pars-tensa displacement magnitudes, the
   resonance frequency and break-up frequency, etc.) in the experimental
   responses with corresponding ones in the model responses, as opposed to
   simply computing frequency-by-frequency differences between experimental
   and model responses. The umbo response of the model is within the range
   of variability seen in the experimental data in terms of the
   low-frequency (i.e., well below the middle-ear resonance) magnitude and
   phase, the main resonance frequency and magnitude, and the roll-off
   slope and irregularities in the response above the resonance frequency,
   but is somewhat high for frequencies above the resonance frequency. At
   low frequencies, the ossicular axis of rotation of the model appears to
   correspond to the anatomical axis but the behaviour is more complex at
   high frequencies (i.e., above the pars-tensa break-up). The behaviour of
   the pars tensa in the model is similar to what is observed
   experimentally in terms of magnitudes, phases, the break-up frequency of
   the spatial vibration pattern, and the bandwidths of the high-frequency
   response features. A sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters
   that have the strongest effects on the model results are the Young's
   modulus, thickness and density of the pars tensa; the Young's modulus of
   the stapedial annular ligament; and the Young's modulus and density of
   the malleus. Displacements of the tympanic membrane and manubrium and
   the low-frequency displacement of the stapes did not show large changes
   when the material properties of the incus, stapes, incudomallear joint,
   incudostapedial joint, and posterior incudal ligament were changed by
   +/- 10 \% from their values in the baseline parameter set.}},

   quotient between the black pixels (bubble representation) divided by the
   total pixels in a binary image. A linear model to describe the Sauter
   diameter as a function of the percent area and the superficial gas rate
   was proposed. The regressions showed a fairly good predictive capacity

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine the use of a friendly full-duplex (FD) relay
   to increase the secrecy rate over a fading channel between the
   legitimate source and the destination in the presence of residual
   self-interference (SI) and eavesdropper. In particular, we consider two
   different protocols based on the FD capability of relay: 1) FD
   transmission (FDT), in which the FD-Relay receives and sends data
   concurrently; 2) FD-Relay with jamming (FDJ), where first, the FD-Relay
   simultaneously receives data and sends jamming to the eavesdropper;
   then, it forwards the data, while the source jams the eavesdropper. We
   first develop the secrecy rate expressions for half-duplex transmission
   (HDT), half-duplex with jamming (HDJ), FDT, and FDJ relaying protocols,
   and then use them to derive their performance properties in terms of the
   channel gains between nodes, eavesdropper types, and more importantly,
   the SI level in FD-Relay. We further investigate the non-convex power
   allocation problems for the developed FDT and FDJ to maximize the
   secrecy rate under the power constraints. In particular, we develop an
   efficient iterative algorithm based on the
   difference-of-two-concave-functions programming. Analytical and
   simulation results show the strong influence of SI level on the achieved
   secrecy rate of the FDT and the FDJ. For sufficiently low SI, FDT
   achieves a much higher secrecy rate than FDJ, HDJ, and HDT. However, for
   higher SI, FDJ becomes more effective in enhancing the achieved secrecy
   rate. The results also indicate that adaptive power allocation can
   significantly improve the performance and confirm that the proposed FDT
   and FDJ outperform the HDT and the HDJ.}},

Title = {{Comparative performance of six supervised learning methods for the
   development of models of hard rock pillar stability prediction}},
Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{291-316}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of pillar stability (PS) in hard rock mines is a crucial
   task for which many techniques and methods have been proposed in the
   literature including machine learning classification. In order to make
   the best use of the large variety of statistical and machine learning
   classification methods available, it is necessary to assess their
   performance before selecting a classifier and suggesting improvement.
   The objective of this paper is to compare different classification
   techniques for PS detection in hard rock mines. The data of this study
   consist of six features, namely pillar width, pillar height, the ratio
   of pillar width to its height, uniaxial compressive strength of the
   rock, pillar strength, and pillar stress. A total of 251 pillar cases
   between 1972 and 2011 are analyzed. Six supervised learning algorithms,
   including linear discriminant analysis, multinomial logistic regression,
   multilayer perceptron neural networks, support vector machine (SVM),
   random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine, are evaluated for
   their ability to learn for PS based on different input parameter
   combinations. In this study, the available data set is randomly split
   into two parts: training set (70 \%) and test set (30 \%). A repeated
   tenfold cross-validation procedure (ten repeats) is applied to determine
   the optimal parameter values during modeling, and an external testing
   set is employed to validate the prediction performance of models. Two
   performance measures, namely classification accuracy rate and Cohen's
   kappa, are employed. The analysis of the accuracy together with kappa
   for the PS data set demonstrates that SVM and RF achieve comparable
   median classification accuracy rate and Cohen's kappa values. All models
   are fitted by ``R{''} programs with the libraries and functions
   described in this study.}},

   surface-modified layer-structured Li{[}Li0.2Ni0.17Co0.07Mn0.56]O-2
   (Li-rich) nanoparticles are employed as cathode for Li storage and

   Li-rich electrode exhibits the best cycling capability, with capacity
   retention ratio of 86\% after 50 cycles, much higher than that of

   modified Li-rich electrode shows superior rate performance and thermal

Abstract = {{Urban canyons increase overall air pollution concentrations at the
   street level. Yet, due to the difficulty in characterizing such
   geometric features over a regional area, they are rarely included in the
   evaluation of population exposures. This study combines measurements of
   ultrafine particles (UFP) with land-use regression techniques in order
   to capture the determinants of near-road concentrations of UFP while
   specifically accounting for urban canyon effects. Using the mean UFP
   concentration measured within a set of urban canyons (over 1000 road
   segments) as the dependent variable, we investigated the effects of a
   number of urban canyon descriptors (width, height, contiguity,
   vegetation, and road class) through a multivariate linear regression.
   Our models are adjusted for the effects of meteorology. The signs and
   values of the regression coefficients are qualitatively consistent with
   what is already known about urban canyons: increased building height
   (b(height) = 0.004; 95\% CI: 0.001, 0.007) along with decreased canyon
   width (b(width) = -0.007; 95\% CI: -0.012, -0.002) serve to worsen the
   air quality therein, while increased tree cover (b(trees) = -1.762; 95\%
   CI: -2.236, -1.289) improves air quality. We also observed that the
   difference in UFP levels on both sides of the canyon increased with
   increasing street width (b(width) = 0.113; 95\% CI: 0.061, 0.165), and
   with wind direction more perpendicular to the street. We conclude that
   it is possible to include urban canyon effects in the development of air
   pollution exposure surfaces thus refining the assessment of population
   exposure to air pollution in urban microenvironments. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present results of a four year field study examining the changes in
   seasonal soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) and soil pH from the application of
   an alkaline treated biosolid (ATB) in an acidic sandy loam soil. Results
   of two management practices, annual ATB applications and a single
   application, and different rates of ATB (0, 7, 14, 28 and 42 Mg ha(-1))
   were also compared over the four year study period. Corn (Zea mays L)
   was used as the test crop throughout the study. Soil pH was effectively
   modified in all treatments receiving ATB rates, compared to the control,
   under both management practices but best results were achieved under
   annual ATB application. Soil cation exchange capacity was increased
   under annual ATB applications, by 3x at the highest ATB. Compared to the
   control, soil nitrogen and pH displayed significant changes under
   frequent additions with increasing rates of ATB. Our results indicate
   that a single application at the highest ATB rate had a residual effect
   on soil pH but little impact on subsequent SMN dynamics. Average soil
   mineral nitrogen (SMN) concentrations in the single application
   management ranged from 8.3 to 9.3 mg kg(-1) in the final three years of
   the study but ranged from 8.5 to 12.1 mg kg(-1) under the annual
   application management. In contrast, annual applications of ATB at rates
   >14 Mg ha(-1) increased seasonal SMN by 15-42\% and soil pH by 1-1.5 pH
   units. Seasonal SMN dynamics under different ATB rates and management
   practices were also examined using a soil nitrogen ratio (SNR) and as an
   area under the seasonal SMN curve. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{268-275}},

Abstract = {{The combination of a bonded joint and bolted joint can potentially
   result in a joint that is stronger and more durable than either
   constituent separately. Experimental studies have demonstrated that the
   greatest ``across-the-board{''} improvements (compared to both
   constituent joints) are obtained when there is substantial load sharing
   between the adhesive and bolt. However, in practice few bonded/bolted
   joint designs experience load sharing, with the adhesive transferring
   most of the load. This work consequently deals with the problem of
   achieving substantial load sharing in bonded/bolted joints. The joint
   type studied was a single-bolt, single-lap composite joint containing an
   elastic-plastic adhesive. The research aim was to identify the most
   significant design parameters contributing to load sharing and to
   quantify/rank their importance. To accomplish this, a global sensitivity
   analysis was conducted of a suitable computational model. In part I of
   this two-part paper, this model is described and is validated both
   experimentally and against a high fidelity three-dimensional finite
   element model. The model predictions are shown to correspond well with
   both the experiment and high fidelity model, while reducing the
   computational cost by >95\% compared to the latter. The validated model
   is subsequently used in the sensitivity analysis presented in part II.

Abstract = {{Bonded/bolted joints in composites are potentially stronger and more
   durable than the underlying bonded and bolted joints separately. While
   recent experimental work has revealed that the most significant
   ``across-the-board{''} improvements (compared to both constituent
   joints) are obtained when there is substantial load sharing between the
   adhesive and bolts, there is currently limited understanding of how load
   sharing works and how it can most effectively be achieved. In order to
   answer this question, this work presents an extensive global sensitivity
   analysis of a computational model of a single-bolt, single-lap composite
   joint containing an elastic-plastic adhesive. This model was previously
   developed and validated in part I of the paper. The objective of the
   sensitivity analysis was to quantify the relative importance of the
   different joint design parameters (factors) in load sharing. It was
   determined that adhesive yield strength is singularly the most important
   factor, by between 2 and 9 times depending on the level of load applied
   to the joint. The joint EID ratio, adhesive hardening slope and adhesive
   thickness were found to be other significant factors influencing load
   sharing. For designs in which the adhesive overlap did not fully
   plasticise, no significant proportion (.10\%) of the applied load was
   found to be transferred to the bolt. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In order to enhance the visible photocatalytic activity of titanium
   dioxide (TiO2), selenium (Se) doped TiO2 was prepared by sol-gel method
   using oxalic acid as a chelating agent. To characterize and describe the
   effect of Set ions on the structural, optical and photocatalytic
   properties of TiO2, the powders were characterized by XRD, FTIR, UV-DRS,
   HR-TEM, PL, Raman, XPS and BET measurements. XRD analysis showed that
   doped powders consist of anatase phase, while undoped TiO2 is a
   composite mixture of anatase and rutile at a calcination temperature of
   550 degrees C. Williamson-Hill plot results indicated the presence of
   tensile strain on the addition of 0.02, 0.04 and 0.06 mol\% Se content,
   while compressive strain was specified on the addition of 0.08, 0.1 and
   0.2 mol\% Se content in TiO2 lattice. FTIR analysis revealed the
   chelating behaviour of oxalic acid with titanium ions in forming
   titanium oxalate stretches. Diffuse reflectance measurements showed that
   visible light absorption is induced by dopant localized/intermediate
   electronic states, probably originating from Se 4s and 4p states within
   the band gap of TiO2. Raman peak broadening and the small frequency
   shifting for the peaks (1-E-g and B-1g) were attributed to oxygen
   vacancies and crystal lattice distortions. Photoluminescence (PL)
   analysis showed that electron hole recombination was decreased with the
   incorporation of Se+4 ions in TiO2, which act as trapping sites for the
   photogenerated electrons. Moreover, PL analysis demonstrated that Se
   doping produces Ti+3 centers, oxygen defects and localized electronic
   states in TiO2 band gap, which become responsible for the TiO2 response
   towards the visible light. The activity of the prepared photocatalysts
   powder were tested by investigating the kinectics of the photocatalytic
   decoloration of methylene blue (MB) under UV irradiations and
   decomposition of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) under visible light irradiation.
   It was observed that the TSe0.08 powder with Bronsted acid sites,
   calcined at 550 degrees C showed highest photocatalytic activity under
   both UV and visible light irradiations for the selected pollutants. In
   the decoloration of MB, TSeoms powder attain a rate constant (k(app))
   value of 0.045 min(-1) which is higher than Degussa P25 (0.033 min(-1))
   as well two times higher than undoped TiO2 (0.021 min-1). Based on the
   obtained results, a UV/vis light irradiated photocatalytic mechanism has
   been proposed for the Se+4 doped anatase TiO2. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the newly developed notion of minimum gain and the
   corresponding Large Gain Theorem. The Large Gain Theorem is an
   input-output stability result particularly well suited to unstable
   plants connected in feedback with stable or unstable controllers. This
   paper aims to facilitate the practical application of these results. An
   altered definition of minimum gain broadens the applicability of the
   Large Gain Theorem, and the novel Minimum Gain Lemma provides LMI
   conditions that imply and are often equivalent to a minimum gain for LTI
   systems. Numerical examples are provided to clarify the differences
   between the existing and proposed definitions of minimum gain, highlight
   the utility of the newly established Minimum Gain Lemma, and demonstrate
   how the paper's contributions may be employed in practice. Copyright (c)

   we synthesized and characterized Au NPs bearing terminally anchored 5
   kDa PEG ligands with univalent carboxymethyl end groups. Using the
   electrophoretic mobilities, acquired over a wide range of ionic

Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{Periodic surface nano-wrinkling is found throughout biological liquid
   crystalline materials, such as collagen films, spider silk gland ducts,
   exoskeleton of beetles, and flower petals. These surface ultrastructures
   are responsible for structural colors observed in some beetles and
   plants that can dynamically respond to external conditions, such as
   humidity and temperature. In this paper, the formation of the surface
   undulations is investigated through the interaction of anisotropic
   interfacial tension, swelling through hydration, and capillarity at free
   surfaces. Focusing on the cellulosic cholesteric liquid crystal (CCLC)
   material model, the generalized shape equation for anisotropic
   interfaces using the Cahn-Hoffman capillarity vector and the
   Rapini-Papoular anchoring energy are applied to analyze periodic
   nano-wrinkling in plant-based plywood free surfaces with water-induced
   cholesteric pitch gradients. Scaling is used to derive the explicit
   relations between the undulations' amplitude expressed as a function of
   the anchoring strength and the spatially varying pitch. The optical
   responses of the periodic nano-structured surfaces are studied through
   finite difference time domain simulations indicating that CCLC surfaces
   with spatially varying pitch reflect light in a wavelength higher than
   that of a CCLC's surface with constant pitch. This structural color
   change is controlled by the pitch gradient through hydration. All these
   findings provide a foundation to understand structural color phenomena
   in nature and for the design of optical sensor devices. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates that both polyelectrolyte viscosity and
   electrosteric stabilization forces contribute to colloidal stability and
   mobility of nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) particles at high
   concentrations (g/L levels) required for groundwater remediation.
   Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) of different molecular weights of 90,000,
   250,000 and 700,000 g/mol was used for colloidal stabilization of NZVI.
   The diameters of the CMC-NZVI aggregates were characterized by light
   scattering techniques and microscopy. The molecular weight of CMC
   significantly influenced the mean aggregate size of NZVI particles. NZVI
   stabilized in 700K CMC (1 g/L) resulted in aggregates of 540 nm mean
   diameter, whereas in 90K CMC (1 g/L) resulted in 1115 nm aggregates, as
   measured by dynamic light scattering. This study demonstrates that the
   increased colloidal stability with 700 K CMC compared to 90 K or 250 K
   CMC is due to effects of viscosity of CMC in solution which reduces the
   Brownian movement of nanoparticles, and due to higher electrosteric
   stabilization of NZVI. The transport (steady-state effluent
   concentration) of CMC-NZVI particles was significantly enhanced with the
   increase in molecular weight of CMC, as a result of formation of smaller
   aggregates and due to the dependence of viscosity on the single
   collector contact efficiency and deposition rate coefficients. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The intervention of coronary bifurcation lesions is associated with
   higher rates of pen- and post-procedural clinical events compared to the
   treatment of isolated lesions. Overall, the factors that influence the
   dynamics of these types of configurations are still not well understood.
   A geometric multiscale model, consisting of a 3D representation of the
   left main coronary artery bifurcation and a OD representation of the
   rest of the cardiovascular system, was developed. Computational fluid
   dynamics simulations of the 3D domain were executed by implementing the
   multiscale algorithm, in order to characterize the functionality of
   different multilesional configurations as a function of stenosis
   severity. The investigation found that coronary branch steal has a
   significant impact on the functionality of the disease and can render a
   two-lesion configuration more severe compared to a three-lesion
   configuration. As a result of the complexity of this phenomenon, it was
   also suggested that certain lesion configurations could result in false
   negatives in diagnosis when employing a pullback pressure recording
   across the tandem lesions. In conclusion, this study showed that
   coronary bifurcation lesions are subject to intricate haemodynamic
   interactions which render the characterization of their functionality
   complex and could have significant clinical implications with regards to
   their diagnosis and prognosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   persistence length of wormlike micelles}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{An expression for the elastic free-energy density of a wormlike micelle
   is derived taking into account interactions between its constituent
   molecules. The resulting expression is quadratic in the curvature and
   torsion of the centerline of micelle and thus resembles free-energy
   density functions for polymer chains and helical filaments such as DNA.
   The model is applied on a wormlike micelle in the shape of a circular
   arc, open or closed. Conditions under which linear chains in dilute
   systems transform into toroidal rings are analyzed. Two concrete
   anisotropic soft-core interaction potentials are used to calculate the
   elastic moduli present in the derived model, in terms of the density of
   the molecules and their dimensions. Expressions for the persistence
   length of the wormlike micelle are found based on the flexural
   rigidities so obtained. Similar to previous observations, our results
   indicate that the persistence length of a wormlike micelle increases as
   the aspect ratio of its constituent molecules increases. A detailed
   application of the model on wormlike micelles of toroidal geometry,
   along with employing statistical-thermodynamical concepts of
   self-assembly is performed, and the results are found to be well
   consistent with the literature. Steps to obtain the material parameters
   through possible experiments are discussed.}},

Title = {{Splashing Threshold of Oblique Droplet Impacts on Surfaces of Various

Abstract = {{Oblique drop impacts were performed at high speeds (up to 27 m/s, We >
   9000) with millimetric water droplets, and a linear model was applied to
   define the oblique splashing threshold. Six different sample surfaces
   were tested: two substrate materials of different inherent surface
   wettability (PTFE and aluminum), each prepared with three different
   surface finishes (smooth, rough, and textured to support
   superhydrophobicity). Our choice of surfaces has allowed us to make
   several novel comparisons. Considering the inherent surface wettability,
   we discovered that PTFE, as the more hydrophobic surface, exhibits lower
   splashing thresholds than the hydrophilic surface of aluminum of
   comparable roughness. Furthermore, comparing oblique impacts on smooth
   and textured surfaces, we found that asymmetrical spreading and
   splashing behaviors occurred under a wide range of experimental
   conditions on our smooth surfaces; however, impacts occurring on
   textured surfaces were much more symmetrical, and one-sided splashing
   occurred only under very specific conditions. We attribute this
   difference to the air-trapping nature of textured superhydrophobic
   surfaces, which lowers the drag between the spreading lamella and the
   surface. The reduced drag affects oblique drop impacts by diminishing
   the effect of the tangential component of the impact velocity, causing
   the impact behavior to be governed almost exclusively by the normal
   velocity. Finally, by comparing oblique impacts on superhydrophobic
   surfaces at different impact angles, we discovered that although the
   pinning transition between rebounding and partial rebounding is governed
   primarily by the normal impact velocity, there is also a weak dependence
   on the tangential velocity. As a result, pinning is inhibited in oblique
   impacts. This led to the observation of a new behavior in highly oblique
   impacts on our superhydrophobic surfaces, which we named the stretched
   rebound, where the droplet is extended into an elongated pancake shape
   and rebounds while still outstretched, without exhibiting a recession
   phase.}},

Title = {{Durable design of reinforced concrete elements against corrosion}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{317-325}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a practice-oriented method for design of flexural
   concrete members for a given service life in an aggressive environment.
   A time-dependent correlation between rebar corrosion level in terms of
   mass loss and its bond strength degradation at the steel-concrete
   interface, and the ultimate flexural and shear resistances of the
   reinforced concrete elements is evaluated using basic electrochemistry
   and empirical relationships. The design development length is determined
   based on the mass loss prediction and the equation depicting loss of
   bond strength with mass loss due to corrosion. The results show that the
   mass loss of rebars depends on several factors, such as the surface
   chloride concentration, cover thickness to rebar and concrete
   permeability, rebar size and ratio of the concrete cover thickness to
   the rebar diameter (c/d(b) ratio). The model results predict the
   required development length at the end of the service life of 70 years
   to be more than twice that obtained from conventional reinforced
   concrete design. The proposed durability design procedure is illustrated
   with the help of a detailed design example. Analysis results show that
   because of corrosion the flexural and shear strengths decrease by about
   80\% and 52\%, respectively, after the service life of 70 years. (C)

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Active vibration control of a free-edge rectangular sandwich plate is
   proposed and tested. The experimental setup consists of a honeycomb
   panel having a carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) outer skins and a
   polymer-paper core, subjected to an orthogonal disturbance, due to an
   electrodynamics exciter and controlled by Macro Fibre Composite (MFC)
   actuators and sensors. MFC parches consist of rectangular piezoceramic
   rods sandwiched between layers of adhesive, electrodes and polyamide
   film. The MFC actuators and sensors are controlled by a programmable
   digital dSPACE (R) controller board. The control algorithm proposed in
   this paper is based on the Positive Position Feedback (PPF) technique
   and is successfully applied with different combinations of
   inputs/outputs (Single Input Single Output, MultiSISO, Multi Input Multi
   Output) in order to control the first four normal modes. The control
   appears to be robust and efficient in reducing vibration in linear
   (small amplitude) and nonlinear (large amplitude) vibrations regimes,
   although the structure under investigation exhibits a relativity high
   modal density, i.e., four resonances in a range of about 100 Hz. The
   control strategy allows to effectively control each resonance both

Abstract = {{A geometrically nonlinear theory is developed for shells of generic
   shape allowing for third-order shear deformation and rotary inertia by
   using five parameters: in-plane and transverse displacements and the two
   rotations of the normal; geometric imperfections are also taken into
   account. The novelty is that geometrically nonlinear strain-displacement
   relationships are derived retaining full nonlinear terms in all the five
   parameters. These relationships are presented in curvilinear
   coordinates, ready to be implemented in computer codes. Higher order
   terms in the transverse coordinate are retained in the derivation so
   that the theory is suitable also for thick laminated shells. The theory
   is applied to laminated composite circular cylindrical shells complete
   around the circumference and simply supported at both ends. Initially
   static finite deformation and buckling due to lateral pressure is
   studied. Finally, large-amplitude forced vibrations under radial
   harmonic excitation are investigated by using the new theory and results
   are compared to another third-order shear deformation theory that

Title = {{Guidelines for measuring and reporting environmental parameters for
   experiments in greenhouses}},
Journal = {{PLANT METHODS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: The importance of appropriate, accurate measurement and
   reporting of environmental parameters in plant sciences is a significant
   aspect of quality assurance for all researchers and their research.
   There is a clear need for ensuring research across the world can be
   compared, understood and where necessary replicated by fellow
   researchers. A common set of guidelines to educate, assist and encourage
   comparativeness is of great importance. On the other hand, the level of
   effort and attention to detail by an individual researcher should be
   commensurate with the particular research being conducted. For example,
   a researcher focusing on interactions of light and temperature should
   measure all relevant parameters and report a measurement summary that
   includes sufficient detail allowing for replication. Such detail may be
   less relevant when the impact of environmental parameters on plant
   growth and development is not the main research focus. However, it
   should be noted that the environmental experience of a plant during
   production can have significant impact when subsequent experiments
   investigate plants at a molecular, biochemical or genetic level or where
   species interactions are considered. Thus, researchers are encouraged to
   make a critical assessment of what parameters are of primary importance
   in their research and these parameters should be measured and reported.
   Content: This paper brings together a collection of parameters that the
   authors, as members of International Committee on Controlled Environment
   Guidelines (ICCEG) in consultation with members of our three parent
   organizations, believe constitute those which should be recorded and
   reported when publishing scientific data from experiments in
   greenhouses. It provides recommendations to end users on when, how and
   where these parameters should be measured along with the appropriate
   internationally standardized units that should be used.}},

Title = {{BHRF1 exerts an antiapoptotic effect and cell cycle arrest via Bcl-2 in

Abstract = {{Apoptosis has been widely studied in order to find methods to increase
   the life-span and production performance in large-scale animal cell
   cultures. The use of anti-apoptotic genes has emerged as an efficient
   method to reduce apoptosis in a variety of biotechnological relevant
   cell lines, including CHO and hybridomas, alternatively to small
   molecule inhibitors. It is already known that expression of BHRF1, an
   Epstein-Barr virus-encoded early protein homologous to the
   anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, protects hybridoma cells from apoptosis in
   batch and continuous operation modes resulting in a delay in the cell
   death process under glutamine starvation conditions. In the present
   study, the mechanism of action of BHRF1 was investigated in a murine
   hybridoma cell line. BHRF1 protein was found in the mitochondrial cell
   fraction both under normal growing conditions and apoptosis-inducing
   conditions. Remarkably, the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl2
   in BHRF1-expressing cells was up-regulated 25-fold compared to
   mock-transfected controls under apoptosis triggering conditions and its
   expression correlated with survival of transgenic cultures and cell
   cycle arrest in G1. Bcl-2 activity was revealed to be crucial for the
   BHRF1-mediated effect since the addition of specific inhibitors of Bcl-2
   (namely HA14-1 and YC-137) resulted in a loss of function of
   BHRF1-expressing cells under glutamine starvation conditions. Moreover,
   the interaction of BHRF1 with the pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bim conferred
   mitochondrial stability to BHRF1 expressing cells under
   apoptosis-triggering conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We have developed a potentiostatic double-pulse technique for silver
   nanoparticle (Ag NP) deposition on graphene (GRn) with superior
   electronic and ionic conductivity. This approach yielded a
   two-dimensional electrocatalyst with a homogeneous Ag NP spatial
   distribution having remarkable performance in the oxygen reduction
   reaction (ORR). GRn sheets were reproducibly prepared by the
   electrochemical exfoliation of graphite (GRp) at high yield and purity
   with a low degree of oxidation. Polystyrenesulfonate added during
   exfoliation enhanced the stability of the GRn solution by preventing the
   restacking of the graphene sheets and increased its ionic conductivity.
   The potentiostatic double-pulse technique is generally used to
   electrodeposit Pt nanoparticles and remains challenging for silver metal
   that exhibits nucleation and growth potentials relatively close to each
   other. We judiciously exploited this narrow margin of potential, and for
   the first time we report Ag NP electrodeposited onto graphene with the
   subsequent ability to control both the density and the size of metallic
   nanoparticles. Considering the high activity along with the lower cost
   of Ag compared to Pt, these findings are highly relevant to the
   successful commercialization of fuel cells and other electrochemical
   energy devices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops the discrete adjoint equations for a turbomachinery
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solver and proposes a framework for
   fully automatic gradient-based constrained aerodynamic shape
   optimization in a multistage turbomachinery environment. The systematic
   approach for the development of the discrete adjoint solver is
   discussed. Special emphasis is put on the development of the
   turbomachinery-specific features of the adjoint solver (that is, on the
   derivation of flow-consistent adjoint inlet and outlet boundary
   conditions) and, to allow for a concurrent rotor-stator optimization and
   stage coupling, on the development of an exact adjoint counterpart to
   the nonreflective, conservative mixing-plane formulation used in the
   flow solver. The adjoint solver is validated by comparing its
   sensitivities with finite difference gradients obtained from the flow
   solver. A sequential-quadratic programming algorithm is used to
   determine an improved blade shape based on the gradient information
   provided by the adjoint solution. Optimization within a
   sequential-quadratic programming framework avoids the time-consuming
   task to determine the weights of the individual constraints by including
   the constraints directly into the design problem. The functionality of
   the proposed optimization method is demonstrated by the redesign of two
   two-dimensional transonic compressor configurations. The design
   objective is to maximize the isentropic efficiency while constraining
   the mass flow rate and the total pressure ratio.}},

   shown that an optical-to-heat energy conversion efficiency of at least
   64\% occurs using a 200 mW continuous wave 532 nm laser heating a 15 mu
   L droplet, resulting in a localized heat generation rate of at least 133
   W cm(-3). From here evaporation of the droplet is caused by an increase
   of the overall fluid temperature (and therefore increased vapor
   pressure) and not non-equilibrium vapor production. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   defects in lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) during the hydrothermal

   creates Fe-antisite defects in LiFePO4; ii) the removal of these
   antisite defects by cation exchange is assisted by a nanometer-thick
   amorphous layer, rich in Li, that enwraps the LiFePO4 crystals. (C) 2015

Title = {{New Protocol for Skin Landmark Registration in Image-Guided

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Newer versions of the commercial Medtronic StealthStation
   allow the use of only 8 landmark pairs for patient-to-image registration
   as opposed to 9 landmarks in older systems. The choice of which landmark
   pair to drop in these newer systems can have an effect on the quality of
   the patient-to-image registration.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate 4 landmark registration protocols based on 8
   landmark pairs and compare the resulting registration accuracy with a
   9-landmark protocol.
   METHODS: Four different protocols were tested on both phantoms and
   patients. Two of the protocols involved using 4 ear landmarks and 4
   facial landmarks and the other 2 involved using 3 ear landmarks and 5
   facial landmarks. Both the fiducial registration error and target
   registration error were evaluated for each of the different protocols to
   determine any difference between them and the 9-landmark protocol.
   RESULTS: No difference in fiducial registration error was found between
   any of the 8-landmark protocols and the 9-landmark protocol. A
   significant decrease (P < .05) in target registration error was found
   when using a protocol based on 4 ear landmarks and 4 facial landmarks
   compared with the other protocols based on 3 ear landmarks.
   CONCLUSION: When using 8 landmarks to perform the patient-to-image
   registration, the protocol using 4 ear landmarks and 4 facial landmarks
   greatly outperformed the other 8-landmark protocols and 9-landmark
   protocol, resulting in the lowest target registration error.}},

   simulation results show that the circuit offers 0.03\% accuracy between
   -55 degrees C and 225 degrees C. The circuit is tested with a commercial

   geometries, as well as the MS(1)-0317 airfoil, and the results have been
   compared to experimental data. Good agreement is observed for both
   impingement limits and collection efficiency. Additionally, the method
   has been applied to a three-element high-lift configuration operating in
   one of the proposed Appendix O Supercooled Large Droplet environments to
   demonstrate the danger posed by the re-impingement of splashing and

Abstract = {{The effect of carbonation curing on the mechanical properties and
   microstructure of concrete masonry units (CMU) with Portland limestone
   cement (PLC) as binder was examined. Slab samples, representing the web
   of a CMU, were initially cured at 25 degrees C and 50\% relative
   humidity for durations up to 18 h. Carbonation was then carried out for
   4 h in a chamber at a pressure of 0.1 MPa. Based on Portland limestone
   cement content, CO2 uptake of PLC concrete after 18 h of initial curing
   reached 18\%. Carbonated and hydrated concretes showed comparable
   compressive strength at both early and late ages due to the 18-h initial
   curing. Carbonation reaction converted early hydration products to a
   crystalline microstructure and subsequent hydration transformed
   amorphous carbonates into more crystalline calcite. Portland limestone
   cement could replace Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) in making equivalent
   CMUs which have shown similar carbon sequestration potential. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We study the performance of centralized least mean squares (CLMS)
   algorithms in wireless sensor networks where nodes transmit their data
   over fading channels to a central processing unit (e.g., a fusion center
   or a cluster head) for parameter estimation. Wireless channel
   impairments, including fading and path loss, distort the transmitted
   data, cause link failure, and degrade the performance of adaptive
   solutions. To address this problem, we propose a novel CLMS algorithm
   that uses a refined version of the transmitted data and benefits from a
   link failure alarm strategy to discard severely distorted data.
   Furthermore, to remove the bias due to communication noise from the
   estimate, we introduce a bias elimination scheme that also leads to a
   lower steady-state mean square error. Our theoretical findings are
   supported by numerical simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Steadily rising carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere has the
   potential to increase plant biomass production and reduce plant
   transpiration in semiarid rangelands. Incorporating results from field
   CO2-enrichment experiments into process-based simulation models enhances
   our ability to project climate change impacts on these rangelands. In
   this study, we added algorithms for computing changes in plant biomass
   growth and stomatal resistance under elevated {[}CO2] to the
   GPFARM-Range (Great Plains Framework for Agricultural Resource
   Management in Rangelands) model, a newly developed stand-alone software
   package for rangeland management. The GPFARM-Range model was tested
   against 5 yr (1997-2001) of soil water and plant biomass data from
   CO2-enrichment (720 ppm) field experiments conducted in shortgrass
   steppe in northern Colorado. Simulated results for both peak standing
   crop biomass and soil water for both ambient and elevated {[}CO2]
   treatments had a percent bias within +/- 10\%, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency
   >= 0.5, and index of agreement > 0.70. The model also captured the
   observed trend of increased C-3 grass biomass and reduced plant
   transpiration under elevated {[}CO2]. The model was used to evaluate the
   separate effectiveness of elevated {[}CO2] on plant growth rate (C-3
   grasses only) and stomatal resistance (both C-3 and C-4 grasses). Two
   separate simulations showed that increased growth rate and stomatal
   resistance due to elevated {[}CO2] enhanced total plant biomass gain
   (C-3 + C-4) by 22\% and 17\%, respectively. The results indicate the
   algorithms used to simulate the impacts of elevated {[}CO2] on range
   plant growth and water use are reliable and can be used to evaluate
   rangeland production for predicted increases in {[}CO2]. However,
   further studies are necessary because the reduction in plant
   transpiration under elevated {[}CO2] was underestimated, and increase in
   nitrogen use efficiency due to elevated {[}CO2] is not included. (C)

Abstract = {{We report on the first demonstration of high-conversion-rate
   photochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) on gallium nitride (GaN)
   nanowire arrays into methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO). It was
   observed that the reduction of CO2 to CO dominates on as-grown GaN
   nanowires under ultraviolet light irradiation. However, the production
   of CH4 is significantly increased by using the Rh/Cr2O3 core/shell
   cocatalyst, with an average rate of similar to 3.5 mu mol g(cat)(-1)
   h(-1) in 24 h. In this process, the rate of CO2 to CO conversion is
   suppressed by nearly an order of magnitude. The rate of photoreduction
   of CO2 to CH4 can be further enhanced and can reach similar to 14.8 mu
   mol gcat(-1) h(-1) by promoting Pt nanoparticles on the lateral m-plane
   surfaces of GaN nanowires, which is nearly an order of magnitude higher
   than that measured on as-grown GaN nanowire arrays. This work
   establishes the potential use of metal-nitride nanowire arrays as a
   highly efficient photocatalyst for the direct photoreduction of CO2 into
   chemical fuels. It also reveals the potential of engineered core/shell
   cocatalysts in improving the selectivity toward more valuable fuels.}},

Abstract = {{A reliable long-term monitoring and diagnosis of breath disorders at an
   early stage provides an improvement of medical act, life expectancy, and
   quality of life while decreasing the costs of treatment and medical
   services. Therefore, a real-time unobtrusive monitoring of respiration
   patterns, as well as breath parameters, is a critical need in medical
   applications. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for
   patient home care, capable of measuring respiration rate and tidal
   volume variability via a wearable sensing technology. The proposed
   system is designed particularly for the goal of diagnosis and treatment
   in patients with pathological breathing, e.g., respiratory complications
   after surgery or sleep disorders. The complete system was comprised of
   wearable calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth low energy, and
   cloud database. The experiments are conducted with eight subjects and
   the overall error in respiration rate calculation is obtained 0.29\%+/-
   0.33\% considering SPR-BTA spirometer as the reference. We also
   introduce a method for tidal volume variability estimation while
   validated using Pearson correlation. Furthermore, since it is essential
   to detect the critical events resulted from sudden rise or fall in per
   breath tidal volume of the patients, we provide a technique to
   automatically find the accurate threshold values based on each
   individual breath characteristics. Therefore, the system is able to
   detect the major changes, precisely by more than 98\%, and provide
   immediate feedback such as sound alarm for round-the-clock respiration
   monitoring.}},

   setup. Capacity results show performance improvements in the case of
   strong line-of-sight scenarios with correlated antenna components and
   resilience against mismatched condition. Finally, we present

Abstract = {{There have been a number of studies of a series of branched metallocene
   polyethylenes (BMPs) made in a solution, continuous stirred tank reactor
   (CSTR) polymerization. The materials studied vary in branching level in
   a systematic way, and the most highly branched members of the series
   exhibit mild strain hardening. An outstanding question is which types of
   branched molecules are responsible for strain hardening in extension.
   This question is explored here by use of polymerization and rheological
   models along with new data on the extensional flow behavior of the most
   highly branched members of the set. After reviewing all that is known
   about the effects of various branching structures in homogeneous
   polymers and comparing this with the structures predicted to be present
   in BMPs, it is concluded that in spite of their very low concentration,
   treelike molecules with branch-on-branch structure provide a large
   number of deeply buried inner segments that are essential for strain
   hardening in these polymers. (C) 2015 The Society of Rheology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines Lewis-number effects on stretched, laminar, premixed
   flames near extinction. It presents the experimental measurement of
   maximum stretched flame speed and extinction limit for the premixed
   laminar combustion of selected low, unity and high-Lewis number
   mixtures. Stretched, fuel-lean, laminar flames of methane with Le
   similar or equal to 1, propane with Le > 1 and hydrogen with Le << 1 are
   studied experimentally in a counter-flow flame configuration. Flow
   velocity is measured in these flames by particle tracking velocimetry.
   Results show that a maximum reference flame speed exists for mixtures
   with Le greater than or similar to 1 at lower flame-stretch values than
   the extinction stretch rate. In contrast, a continually-increasing
   reference flame speed is measured for Le << 1 mixtures until extinction
   occurs when the flame is constrained by the stagnation point. Laminar
   flame results are also compared to numerical simulations employing a
   one-dimensional stagnation flame model. The chemical-kinetic models for
   each respective mixture capture the important trends of a maximum in
   s(u,ref) ahead of the extinction stretch rate for methane and propane,
   and an increasing s(u,ref) to extinction for hydrogen. These results are
   important to the investigation of the leading edge theory of premixed
   turbulent combustion, in which maximum stretched flamelet speed is a key
   parameter. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Identification of potential sites for rainwater harvesting (RWH) is an
   important step toward maximizing water availability and land
   productivity in arid semi-arid regions. Characterised as a ``water
   scarce{''} country, Egypt has limited fresh water supplies, and is
   expected to suffer from water stress by the year 2030. Therefore, it is
   important to develop any means available to supply water and maintain
   human habitability in a sustainable manner. Practiced or simply
   indispensable in many countries around the world, rainwater harvesting
   (RWH) promotes a sustainable and efficient manner of exploiting water
   resources. In the present study, suitable areas for sustainable
   stormwater harvesting and storage in Egypt were identified using remote
   sensing for land cover data - location assessment linked to a decision
   support system (DSS). The DSS took into consideration a combination of
   thematic layers such as rainfall surplus, slope, potential runoff
   coefficient (PRC), land cover/use, and soil texture. Taking into account
   five thematic layers, the spatial extents of RWH suitability areas were
   identified by an analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The model generated
   a RWH map with five categories of suitability: excellent, good,
   moderate, poor and unsuitable. The spatial distribution of these
   categories in the area investigated was such that 4.8\% (47910 km(2))
   and 14\% (139739 km(2)) of the study area was classified as excellent or
   good in terms of RWH, respectively, while 30.1\% (300439 km(2)), 47.6\%
   (474116 km(2)) and 3.5\% (34935 km(2)) of the area were classified as
   moderate, unsuitable and poor, respectively. Most of the areas with
   excellent to good suitability had slopes of between 2\% and 8\% and were
   intensively cultivated areas. The major soil type in the excellent
   suitability areas was loam, while rainfall ranged from 100 to 200 mm
   yr(-1). The use of a number of RWH sites in the excellent areas is
   recommended to ensure successful implementation of RWH systems.}},

Abstract = {{As additive manufacturing (AM) process evolves from rapid prototyping to
   the end-of-use product manufacturing process, manufacturing constraints
   have largely been alleviated and design freedom has been significantly
   broadened, including shape complexity, material complexity, hierarchical
   complexity, and functional complexity. Inevitably, conventional Design
   Theory and Methodology (DTM) especially life-cycle objectives oriented
   ones are challenged. In this paper, firstly, the impact of AM on
   conventional DTM is analyzed in terms of design for manufacturing (DFM),
   design for assembly (DFA), and design for performance (DFP). Abundance
   of evidences indicate that conventional DTM is not qualified to embrace
   these new opportunities and consequently underline the need for a set of
   design principles for AM to achieve a better design. Secondly, design
   methods related with AM are reviewed and classified into three main
   groups, including design guidelines, modified DTM for AM, and design for
   additive manufacturing (DFAM). The principles and representative design
   methods in each category are studied comprehensively with respect to
   benefits and drawbacks. A new design method partially overcoming these
   drawbacks by integrating function integration and structure optimization
   to realize less part count and better performance is discussed. Design
   tools as a necessary part for supporting design are also studied. In the
   meantime, the review also identified the possible areas for future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{An adequate supply of plant-available nutrients and an appropriate
   chemical composition of soils in tree pits are important factors
   affecting the health and life span of trees in urban environments. We
   used Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) to explore
   relationships between nutrient availability, soil organic matter (SOM),
   soil pH, land use, soil age (time since tree transplanting from nursery
   to the tree pit), street width, and tree pit cover material in Montreal,
   Quebec, Canada. Soil was collected to a depth of 20 cm from tree pits
   along commercial and residential streets and analyzed for concentrations
   of plant available K, Ca, Mg, P, and N, concentration of Na, SOM content
   and soil pH. Mulching with wood chips and soil age influenced the
   availability of K, P, and N in the tree pit soils. Sodium concentration
   was positively correlated with soil pH, possibly due to the displacement
   of H+ by Na+ originating from de-icing salt. Soil organic matter content
   was positively correlated with Mg and Na concentrations in tree pit
   soils in commercial zones, and with K and Ca concentrations in those of
   residential zones. Soil from tree pits located along wide streets in
   commercial zones had high concentrations of Na and Ca, possibly due to
   higher volumes of traffic on those streets splashing more de-icing salt,
   and increased weathering of buildings and sidewalk by de-icing salt. The
   information presented here can be a valuable baseline for managing
   nutrients in tree pits, in order to mitigate the stresses that can
   shorten the life of street trees.}},

Journal = {{NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{305-316}},

Abstract = {{Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is an estimation technique
   widely used in mining research to model relationship among a dependent
   variable and a set of explanatory variables. However, OLS is based on
   strong assumption such as normality of the error term, exogeneity of
   explanatory variables, linearity between regression coefficients, and
   homo-scedasticity. When one or more of the assumption are not held, OLS
   can lead to biased and inefficient estimates of the true population
   parameters. Using biased estimates of the population parameters may
   result in serious problems in mining decision making, especially if key
   decisions are based on the biased parameter estimates. One of the main
   reasons that can lead OLS to provide biased estimates is the presence of
   outlier data points in the sampled population. In this paper, we focus
   on alternatives to the OLS estimator, which are more robust (or
   resistant) to the presence of outliers. Two case studies were conducted
   to compare OLS and robust regression approaches namely L1-estimation,
   M-estimation, least trimmed squares, least median squares, and
   MM-estimation. The case studies showed that inference based on OLS in
   the presence of outliers could lead to bad decisions if regression
   coefficients are not interpreted correctly. Robust regression approach
   can provide estimates useful even if a dataset is contaminated with
   outliers.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the hidden details that are responsible for the
   practical success of cubic equations of state (EOS) in phase equilibrium
   calculations. A detailed consideration of the van der Waals method for
   evaluating the pure compound EOS parameters sheds new light on the
   reasons why the elimination of the actual critical volume as parameter
   was also adopted in the Redlich-Kwong and the Peng-Robinson (PR)
   frameworks. It is shown that an interesting relationship for the
   critical compressibility factor arising from the Martin-Hou method opens
   a new door for future exploration of different frameworks. A
   consideration of the key steps of Soave's reasoning for determining the
   temperature dependence of the attractive parameter explains the larger
   success of the Stryjek-Vera modification of PR EOS over the PR EOSs. A
   reference to the extension of cubic EOS to calculate liquid densities
   and enthalpies and a ready to use algorithm for the evaluation of the
   roots of a cubic equation are included for instructional purposes. (c)

   liquid solution: this model is particularly suited for liquid which
   exhibits a high degree of short-range order. The intermetallic compounds
   are modeled with the Compound Energy Formalism (CEF), and terminal solid
   solutions are modeled with Bragg-Williams model (BWM) with sub-regular
   solution approximation. All available and reliable experimental data are
   reproduced within experimental error limits. A self-consistent

Abstract = {{A variational approach is used to study the stability of a soap film
   spanning a flexible loop. The film is modeled as a fluid surface endowed
   with constant tension and the loop is modeled as an inextensible and
   unshearable elastic rod that resists not only bending but also twisting
   about the tangent to its centerline. The first and second variations of
   the underlying energy functional are derived, leading to governing
   equilibrium equations and energetically based stability conditions. The
   latter conditions are applied to explore the effect of subjecting flat
   circular configurations to planar and transverse perturbations. Both the
   areal stretching and the lineal twisting prove to compete against the
   lineal bending to destabilize such a configuration. Experiments are
   performed to study post-buckled configurations and to assess the
   validity of the theoretical predictions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this study, the carbonation and hydration behavior of electrical arc
   furnace (EAF) slag and basic oxygen furnace (BOF) slag were examined.
   Steel slag is a latent hydraulic material. Its early strength can be
   activated by carbonation reaction. The carbonated steel slag can be used
   as a binder to replace Portland cement in the fabrication of building
   products. It was found that steel slag could develop a compressive
   strength of 20 MPa in EAF slag and 36 MPa in EAF-BOF hybrid slag after a
   combination of carbonation and hydration. Higher calcium silicate
   content and longer carbonation time could result in a higher compressive
   strength. The activated steel slag binders were composed of calcium
   carbonates intermingled with calcium silicate hydrates, forming a
   particle reinforced composite material. It was the calcium silicate
   content in raw slag, rather than the CaO content, that determined the
   extent of carbonation activation. Replacing Portland cement with steel
   slag could help preserve natural resources, reduce the embodied energy
   and promote carbon utilization in building products.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme flood events are complex and inherently uncertain phenomenons.
   Consequently forecasts of floods are inherently uncertain in nature due
   to various sources of uncertainty including model uncertainty, input
   uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty. This paper investigates two
   types of natural and model uncertainties in extreme rainfall-runoff
   events in a semi-arid region. Natural uncertainty is incorporated in the
   distribution function of the series of annual maximum daily rainfall,
   and model uncertainty is an epistemic uncertainty source. The kinematic
   runoff and erosion model was used for rainfall-runoff simulation. The
   model calibration scheme is carried out under the generalized likelihood
   uncertainty estimation framework to quantify uncertainty in the
   rainfall-runoff modeling process. Uncertainties of the rainfall
   depths-associated with depth duration frequency curves-were estimated
   with the bootstrap sampling method and described by a normal probability
   density function. These uncertainties are presented in the
   rainfall-runoff modeling for investigation of uncertainty effects on
   extreme hydrological events discharge and can be embedded into
   guidelines for risk-based design and management of urban water
   infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the motion of a spherical robot rolling on a generic

   constraints into the motion equations in a straightforward manner. The
   motion equations capture the nonholonomic nature of rolling without

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional structure of water flow at river confluences makes
   these zones of particular importance in the fields of river engineering,
   fluvial geomorphology, sedimentology and navigation. While previous
   research has concentrated on the effects of hydraulic and geometric
   parameters on the scour patterns at river confluences, there remains a
   lack of expert systems designed to predict the maximum scour depth
   (d(sm)). In the present study, several soft computing models, namely
   multi-layer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) and M5P model
   tree, were used to predict the d(sm) at river confluences under live-bed
   conditions. Model performance, assessed through a number of statistical
   indices (RMSE, MAE, MARE and R-2), showed that while all three models
   could provide acceptable predictions of d(sm) under live-bed conditions,
   the MLP model was the most accurate. By testing the models at three
   different ranges of scour depths, we determined that while the MLP model
   was the most accurate model in the low scour depth range, the RBF model
   was more accurate in the higher range of scour depths. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Designing greener plasticizers: Effects of alkyl chain length and

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{106-112}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The ubiquitous presence of the plasticizer di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
   (DEHP) in the environment is of concern due to negative biological
   effects associated with it and its metabolites. In particular, the
   metabolite mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) is a potential endocrine
   disruptor. Earlier work had identified the diester di (2-ethylhexyl)
   maleate (DEHM) as a potential greener candidate plasticizer to replace
   DEHP, yet its biodegradation rate was reported to be slow. In this
   study, we modified the side chains of maleate diesters to be linear
   (i.e., unbranched) alkyl chains that varied in length from ethyl to
   n-octyl. The plasticization efficiency of these compounds blended into
   PVC at 29 wt.\% increased with the overall length of the molecule, but
   all compounds performed as well as or better than comparable samples
   with DEHP. Tests conducted with the equally long DEHM and dihexyl
   maleate (DHM) showed that branching has no effect on glass transition
   temperature (T-g) reduction efficiency. Biodegradation experiments with
   the common soil bacterium Rhodococcus rhodocrous in the presence of the
   plasticizer showed acceptable hydrolysis rates of maleates with
   unbranched side chains, while the branched DEHM showed almost no
   degradation. The addition of hexadecane as auxiliary carbon source
   improved hydrolysis rates. Temporary buildup of the respective monoester
   of the compounds were observed, but only in the case of the longest
   molecule, dioctyl maleate (DOM), did this buildup lead to growth
   inhibition of the bacteria. Maleates with linear side chains, if
   designed and tested properly, show promise as potential candidate
   plasticizers as replacements for DEHP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigated the use of systems tools and process mapping to
   enhance engagement in pollution prevention (P2) within a Canadian dairy
   processing facility. A preliminary assessment of the facility led to the
   development of simplified process maps that were later applied in
   semi-structured interviews with frontline facility operators. The
   simplified process maps helped engage the frontline workers during the
   short (1 hour) interview process and resulted in identifying 41 areas of
   inefficient resource use related to product loss, water, energy, and
   chemical consumption, and processing/scheduling issues. Solutions to
   some of these P2 opportunities amounted to potential reductions in water
   consumption of 23,000 m(3) per year and a minimum reduction of 10,300 kg
   per year of biochemical oxygen demand (BUD) effluent discharges to the
   municipality. A combined estimated cost savings of over \$175,000 per
   year is anticipated due to reduction in raw milk wastage, water
   consumption and BUD surcharge fines, alone. Causal loop diagrams (CLDs)
   constructed from semi-structured interviews showed the integrated nature
   of the facility's processing operations and the compounding impact of
   resource use inefficiency throughout this process. The CLDs also showed
   the potential to identify additional areas for data collection and
   analysis, visualize the cumulative benefits associated with implementing
   P2 solutions, engage more systematically the frontline workers and
   facility managers and be revised as new knowledge is gained or process
   changes are made. Both simplified process maps and causal loop diagrams
   can be used as effective tools for improving participation and enhanced
   decision making in P2 within dairy processing and other industries. (C)

Abstract = {{This letter introduces a design and proof-of-concept implementation of
   Gabor filters based on stochastic computation for area-efficient
   hardware. The Gabor filter exhibits a powerful image feature extraction
   capability, but it requires significant computational power. Using
   stochastic computation, a sine function used in the Gabor filter is
   approximated by exploiting several stochastic tanh functions designed
   based on a state machine. A stochastic Gabor filter realized using the
   stochastic sine shaper and a stochastic exponential function is
   simulated and compared with the original Gabor filter that shows almost
   equivalent behaviour at various frequencies and variance. A
   root-mean-square error of 0.043 at most is observed. In order to reduce
   long latency due to stochastic computation, 68 parallel stochastic Gabor
   filters are implemented in Silterra 0.13 mu m CMOS technology. As a
   result, the proposed Gabor filters achieve a 78\% area reduction
   compared with a conventional Gabor filter while maintaining the
   comparable speed.}},

Title = {{Personality disorder symptomatology is associated with anomalies in

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Personality disorder symptomatology (PD-Sx) can result in personal
   distress and impaired interpersonal functioning, even in the absence of
   a clinical diagnosis, and is frequently comorbid with psychiatric
   disorders such as substance use, mood, and anxiety disorders; however,
   they often remain untreated, and are not taken into account in clinical
   studies. To investigate brain morphological correlates of PD-Sx, we
   measured subcortical volume and shape, and cortical thickness/surface
   area, based on structural magnetic resonance images. We investigated 37
   subjects who reported PD-Sx exceeding DSM-IV Axis-II screening
   thresholds, and 35 age, sex, and smoking status-matched control
   subjects. Subjects reporting PD-Sx were then grouped into symptom-based
   clusters: N = 20 into Cluster B (reporting Antisocial, Borderline,
   Histrionic, or Narcissistic PD-Sx) and N = 28 into Cluster C (reporting
   Obsessive Compulsive, Avoidant, or Dependent PD-Sx); N = 11 subjects
   reported PDSx from both clusters, and none reported Cluster A (Paranoid,
   Schizoid, or Schizotypal) PD-Sx. Compared to control, Cluster C PD-Sx
   was associated with greater striatal surface area localized to the
   caudate tail, smaller ventral striatum volumes, and greater cortical
   thickness in right prefrontal cortex. Both Cluster B and C PD-Sx groups
   also showed trends toward greater posterior caudate volumes and
   orbitofrontal surface area anomalies, but these findings did not survive
   correction for multiple comparisons. The results point to morphological
   abnormalities that could contribute to Cluster C PDSx. In addition, the
   observations parallel those in substance use disorders, pointing to the
   importance of considering PD-Sx when interpreting findings in
   often-comorbid psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The interplay between strain and composition is at the basis of
   heterostructure design to engineer new properties. The influence of the
   strain distribution on the incorporation of indium during the formation
   of multiple InGaN/GaN quantum dots (QDs) in nanowire (NW)
   heterostructures has been investigated, using the combined techniques of
   geometric phase analysis of atomic-resolution images and quantitative
   elemental mapping from core-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy
   within scanning transmission electron microscopy. The variation in
   In-content between successive QDs within individual NWs shows a
   dependence on the magnitude of compressive strain along the growth
   direction within the underlying GaN barrier layer, which affects the
   incorporation of In-atoms to minimize the local effective strain energy.
   Observations suggest that the interfacial misfit between InGaN/GaN
   within the embedded QDs is mitigated by strain partitioning into both
   materials, and results in normal stresses inflicted by the presence of
   the surrounding GaN shell. These experimental measurements are linked to
   the local piezoelectric polarization fields for individual QDs, and are
   discussed in terms of the photoluminescence from an ensemble of NWs.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{174}},

Abstract = {{The effect of gold substrate surface charge (potential) on
   adsorptive/desorptive behaviour of fibrinogen (FG) was studied by
   employing differential capacitance (DC) and polarization modulated
   infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), in terms of FG
   adsorption thermodynamics, kinetics, and desorption kinetics. The gold
   substrate surface charge was modulated in-situ within the
   electrochemical double-layer region by means of electrochemical
   potentiostatic polarization in a FG-containing electrolyte, thus
   avoiding the interference of other physico-chemical properties of the
   gold surface on FG's interfacial behaviour. The FG adsorption
   equilibrium was modeled using the Langmuir isotherm. Highly negative
   values of apparent Gibbs free energy of adsorption (ranging from from
   -52.1+/-0.4 to -55.8+/-0.8 kJ mol(-1), depending on the FG adsorption
   potential) indicated a highly spontaneous and strong adsorption of FG
   onto the gold surface. The apparent Gibbs free energy of adsorption was
   found to be independent of surface charge when the surface was
   negatively charged. However, when the gold surface was positively
   charged, the apparent Gibbs free energy of adsorption exhibited a
   pronounced linear relationship with the surface charge, shifting to more
   negative values with an increase in positive electrode potential. The
   adsorption kinetics of FG was also found to be dependent on gold surface
   charge in a similar manner to the apparent Gibbs free energy of
   adsorption.
   It was suggested that the driving force for the adsorption of FG on a
   negatively charged surface represents a positive gain in the entropy of
   the system, whereas the adsorption on a positively charged gold surface
   was found to be controlled by electrostatic forces.
   FG desorption measurements revealed that when the gold surface is
   polarized within the electrochemical double-layer region during the
   desorption process, the protein desorption kinetics is rather slow.
   However, within the regions of hydrogen and oxygen evolution, the FG
   desorption kinetics accelerates significantly, due to the physical
   removal of the adsorbed protein layer by gas bubbles evolving from the
   substrate surface, which enables a complete removal of the pre-adsorbed
   FG layer. The latter could potentially be employed for electrochemical
   cleaning of electrically-conducting surfaces fouled by adsorbed protein
   layers (heat exchangers, filtration membranes, etc.). (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We propose the design and implementation of frequency domain block least
   mean square and block recursive least square equalizers for adaptive
   zero-guard-interval (ZGI) coherent optical (CO) orthogonal frequency
   division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We experimentally demonstrate the
   improvements in fiber nonlinear tolerance and channel estimation
   accuracy over conventional training symbol (TS)-based equalizers and
   data aided zero-forcing (ZF) equalizers, in single channel 112-Gb/s
   quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), and 250-Gb/s 16 quadrature
   amplitude modulation (QAM) ZGI CO-OFDM systems. The transmission
   distance is increased by 20\% and 7\% for QPSK, and 53\% and 35\% for
   16-QAM systems, compared with the TS-based and decision aided ZF
   adaptive equalizers, respectively. In addition, simulation results
   demonstrate the improved temporal tracking ability of the proposed
   algorithms over the previous ZF equalizer.}},

Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{The static stability of weightless liquid bridges with a free contact
   line with respect to axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric perturbations is
   studied. Constant-volume and constant-pressure stability regions are
   constructed in slenderness versus cylindrical volume diagrams for fixed
   contact angles. Bifurcations along the stability-region boundaries are
   characterized by the structure of axisymmetric bridge branches and
   families of equilibria. A wave-number definition is presented based on
   the pieces-of-sphere states at branch terminal points to classify
   equilibrium branches and identify branch connections. Compared with
   liquid bridges pinned at two equal disks, the free contact line breaks
   the equatorial and reflective symmetries, affecting the lower boundary
   of the constant-volume stability region where axisymmetric perturbations
   are critical. Stability is lost at transcritical bifurcations and
   turning points along this boundary. Our results furnish the
   maximum-slenderness stability limit for drop deposition on real surfaces
   when the contact angle approaches the receding contact angle.}},

Title = {{Genome-scale metabolic model of Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 (iMT1174) to
   study the accumulation of storage compounds during nitrogen-limited
   condition}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 growing on different substrates is
   capable of accumulating simultaneously three types of carbon storage
   compounds: glycogen, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and triacylglycerols
   (TAG). Under nitrogen-limited (N-limited) condition, the level of
   storage increases as is commonly observed for other bacteria. The
   proportion of each storage compound changes with substrate, but it
   remains unclear what modelling approach should be adopted to predict the
   relative composition of the mixture of the storage compounds. We
   analyzed the growth of R. jostii RHA1 under N-limited conditions using a
   genome-scale metabolic modelling approach to determine which global
   metabolic objective function could be used for the prediction.
   Results: The R. jostii RHA1 model (iMT1174) produced during this study
   contains 1,243 balanced metabolites, 1,935 unique reactions, and 1,174
   open reading frames (ORFs).
   Seven objective functions used with flux balance analysis (FBA) were
   compared for their capacity to predict the mixture of storage compounds
   accumulated after the sudden onset of N-limitation. Predictive abilities
   were determined using a Bayesian approach. Experimental data on storage
   accumulation mixture (glycogen, polyhydroxyalkanoates, and
   triacylglycerols) were obtained for batch cultures grown on glucose or
   acetate. The best FBA simulation results were obtained using a novel
   objective function for the N-limited condition which combined the
   maximization of the storage fluxes and the minimization of metabolic
   adjustments (MOMA) with the preceding non-limited conditions (max
   storage + environmental MOMA). The FBA solutions for the non-limited
   growth conditions were simply constrained by the objective function of
   growth rate maximization. Measurement of central metabolic fluxes by
   13C-labelling experiments of amino acids further supported the
   application of the environmental MOMA principle in the context of
   changing environment. Finally, it was found that the quantitative
   predictions of the storage mixture during N-limited storage accumulation
   were fairly sensitive to the biomass composition, as expected.
   Conclusions: The genome-scale metabolic model analysis of R. jostii RHA1
   cultures suggested that the intracellular reaction flux profile
   immediately after the onset of N-limited condition are impacted by the
   values of the same fluxes during the period of non-limited growth. PHA
   turned out to be the main storage pool of the mixture in R. jostii RHA1.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid droplets bridging filaments are ubiquitous in nature and
   technology. Although the liquid-surface shape and the capillary force
   and torque have been studied extensively, the effect of filament
   flexibility is poorly understood. Here, we show that elastic deformation
   (at large values of the elasto-capillary number) can significantly
   affect the liquid-surface shape and capillary force. The equilibrium
   state of parallel filaments is calculated using analytical
   approximations and numerical solutions for the fluid interface. The
   results compare well, and the numerical solution is then applied to
   crossing filaments. In the investigated range of parameters, the
   capillary force increases rapidly when the filaments touch. The force
   decreases continuously when decreasing the liquid volume for parallel
   hydrophilic filaments but produces a maximum for crossed filaments. The
   liquid volume at the maximum force is reported when changing the
   filament flexibility, crossing angle, and contact angle. These results
   may be beneficial in applications where the strength and structure of
   wet fibrous materials are important, such as in paper formation and when
   welding flexible components.}},

Journal = {{MOBILE DNA}},

Abstract = {{DNA derived from transposable elements (TEs) constitutes large parts of
   the genomes of complex eukaryotes, with major impacts not only on
   genomic research but also on how organisms evolve and function. Although
   a variety of methods and tools have been developed to detect and
   annotate TEs, there are as yet no standard benchmarks-that is, no
   standard way to measure or compare their accuracy. This lack of accuracy
   assessment calls into question conclusions from a wide range of research
   that depends explicitly or implicitly on TE annotation. In the absence
   of standard benchmarks, toolmakers are impeded in improving their tools,
   annotators cannot properly assess which tools might best suit their
   needs, and downstream researchers cannot judge how accuracy limitations
   might impact their studies. We therefore propose that the TE research
   community create and adopt standard TE annotation benchmarks, and we
   call for other researchers to join the authors in making this
   long-overdue effort a success.}},

Abstract = {{Intratumoral injection of ultra-small gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
   conjugated to doxorubicin (Au-Dox) is effective against both murine B16
   and human SK-MEL-28 tumors in mice. Au-Dox suppresses growth of B16
   tumors in immunocompetent mice by >70\% for at least 19 days. In
   SK-MEL-28 xenografts, Au-Dox suppresses tumor growth almost completely
   for >13 weeks, while tumors treated with Dox alone demonstrate
   accelerated growth after 10 weeks. Histological analysis shows
   significant apoptosis and necrosis in Au-Dox treated tumors.
   Intratumoral injection is significantly more effective than intravenous
   injection, which leads to significant accumulation in liver and kidney
   with sub-therapeutic concentrations of Au-Dox. However, IV injection
   does not lead to significant damage in non-target organs, so improved
   targeting should permit this mode of delivery with little risk of
   systemic toxicity. The current construct is suitable for tumors
   accessible to intratumoral injection and represents a viable approach

Abstract = {{Discovered in 1909 by Retzius and described mainly by morphology, the
   cytoplasmic droplet of sperm (renamed here the Hermes body) is conserved
   among all mammalian species but largely undefined at the molecular
   level. Tandem mass spectrometry of the isolated Hermes body from rat
   epididymal sperm characterized 1511 proteins, 43 of which were localized
   to the structure in situ by light microscopy and two by quantitative
   electron microscopy localization. Glucose transporter 3 (GLUT-3)
   glycolytic enzymes, selected membrane traffic and cytoskeletal proteins
   were highly abundant and concentrated in the Hermes body. By electron
   microscope gold antibody labelling, the Golgi trafficking protein
   TMED7/p27 localized to unstacked flattened cisternae of the Hermes body,
   as did GLUT-3, the most abundant protein. Its biogenesis was deduced
   through the mapping of protein expression for all 43 proteins during
   male germ cell differentiation in the testis. It is at the terminal step
   19 of spermiogenesis that the 43 characteristic proteins accumulated in
   the nascent Hermes body.}},

Journal = {{SEMICONDUCTOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this study a theoretical analysis of hourglass-graded light emitting
   diodes (LEDs) is provided. The term hourglass-grading refers to the
   placement of a wide band gap material at the diode contacts, smoothly
   tapering to a smaller band gap material in the active centre region.
   Utilizing AlGaN as our model system, we show that such a device can both
   effectively confine carrier recombination and mitigate overflow under
   high doping conditions. Moreover, by lowering the Auger coefficient of
   recombination in the active region, room temperature internal quantum
   efficiencies of 95\% or more might be achieved in hourglass-graded LEDs
   at drive currents near 10(3) A cm(-2).}},

Abstract = {{The full-duplex (FD) single-user multiple-input-multiple-output

   maximization problem to transform the problem into a convex optimization
   problem and develop the SIT-based FD precoding (FDP-SIT) algorithm. In
   particular, the FDP-SIT algorithm consists of an inner loop that assumes
   fixed threshold values and an outer loop that optimizes each node's
   threshold values. Illustrative examples show how the proposed FDP-SIT
   algorithm can provide a tradeoff between the separate and joint FDP
   algorithms. As well, the measured data-based results suggest that the
   FDP-SIT algorithm can offer increased sum rates when low cancelation
   power is used.}},

Abstract = {{Ferroelectric materials have been studied increasingly for solar energy
   conversion technologies due to the efficient charge separation driven by
   the polarization induced internal electric field. However, their
   insufficient conversion efficiency is still a major challenge. Here, a
   photocathode material of epitaxial double perovskite Bi2FeCrO6
   multiferroic thin film is reported with a suitable conduction band
   position and small bandgap (1.9-2.1 eV), for visible-light-driven
   reduction of water to hydrogen. Photoelectrochemical measurements show
   that the highest photocurrent density up to -1.02 mA cm(-2) at a
   potential of -0.97V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is obtained in
   p-type Bi2FeCrO6 thin film photocathode grown on SrTiO3 substrate under
   AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. In addition, a twofold enhancement of
   photocurrent density is obtained after negatively poling the Bi2FeCrO6
   thin film, as a result of modulation of the band structure by suitable
   control of the internal electric field gradient originating from the
   ferroelectric polarization in the Bi2FeCrO6 films. The findings validate
   the use of multiferroic Bi2FeCrO6 thin films as photocathode materials,
   and also prove that the manipulation of internal fields through
   polarization in ferroelectric materials is a promising strategy for the
   design of improved photoelectrodes and smart devices for solar energy
   conversion.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions, new technologies are
   being proposed that can aid in greenhouse gas sequestration. One such
   technology involves trapping carbon dioxide in hydrate form. To optimize
   this process, it is of interest to investigate how the hydrate system
   behaves in the presence of promoting agents. In this work, the effect of
   asproduced and amine-functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)
   on carbon dioxide dissolution and hydrate growth rates was studied. For
   either type of the MWNTs, the effect on saturation values and
   dissolution rates was negligible. Under lower concentrations, it was
   found that both forms of MWNTs enhanced growth, with the functionalized
   MWNTs performing slightly better. Under higher concentrations, both
   forms of MWNTs decreased growth rates, because the initial nucleation
   event was more pronounced and led to heat- and mass-transfer
   limitations.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the phase transformation of bulk MoS2 crystals from
   the metastable metallic 1T/1T' phase to the thermodynamically stable
   semiconducting 2H phase. The metastable 1T/1T' material was prepared by
   Li intercalation and deintercalation. The thermally driven kinetics of
   the phase transformation were studied with in situ Raman and optical
   reflection spectroscopies and yield an activation energy of 400 +/- 60
   meV (38 +/- 6 kJ/mol). We calculate the expected minimum energy pathways
   for these transformations using DFT methods. The experimental activation
   energy corresponds approximately to the theoretical barrier for a single
   formula unit, suggesting that nucleation of the phase transformation is
   quite local. We also report that femtosecond laser writing converts
   1T/1T' to 2H in a single laser pass. The mechanisms for the phase
   transformation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of direct bandgap semiconducting two-dimensional (2D)
   transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has opened a new era in
   flexible optoelectronic devices. Critical to this development is the
   realization of a semiconductor laser using the emerging 2D TMDCs. Here,
   by embedding 2D MoS2 at the interface between a free-standing microdisk
   and microsphere, we have demonstrated, for the first time,
   room-temperature lasing from 2D TMDCs. The devices exhibit multiple
   lasing peaks in the wavelength range of similar to 600 to 800 nm. The
   threshold is measured to be similar to 5 mu W under continuous wave
   operation at room temperature. No saturation in the output power is
   measured for pump powers more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than the
   threshold. The superior performance is attributed to the large gain of
   2D TMDCs and the strong coupling between the 2D MoS2 gain medium and
   optical modes in the unique optical cavity.}},

Journal = {{CRYSTAL GROWTH \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanofluids have been shown to enhance
   the crystallization process of water to ice. While the beneficial
   effects of MWCNTs on phase change processes are well-documented, little
   work has been conducted to investigate the behavior of MWCNTs during and
   after exposure to freezing conditions: In this work, the crystallization
   morphology of water droplets containing surface-functionalized
   hydrophilic MWCNTs was evaluated at three driving force temperatures and
   two concentrations of nanofluid. At low supercoolings, the MWCNTs are
   completely expelled from the crystal matrix due to slow solidification
   rates. At high supercoolings, the MWCNTs are embedded in the solid
   droplet within air volumes and interdendritic regions as a result of
   rapid crystallization speeds. The results show that the dispersion of
   MWCNTs within the solid ice matrix itself was not achieved at these
   levels of supercooling. Under all conditions, freezing of the colloidal
   system results in destabilization the MWCNTs and loss of dispersion.
   These effects are important considerations for applications requiring
   successful freeze/thaw cycling of nanofluid systems as well as in the
   storage and transport of colloidal suspensions.}},

   Ara h 6 peanut protein allergen}},
Journal = {{INNOVATIVE FOOD SCIENCE \& EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{79-88}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The study uses molecular dynamic simulation to evaluate the effect of
   static and oscillating electric field (2450 MHz) of intensity 0.05 V/nm
   at different temperatures 300 K, 380 K and 425 K on structural
   conformation of Ara h 6 peanut protein allergen. The conformational
   changes in the protein were studied with respect to root mean square
   deviation, radius of gyration, dipole moment and solvent accessible
   surface area. The increase in temperature and application of external
   electric fields, both static and oscillating fields had significant
   effect on the conformation of Ara h 6, specifically the helical
   secondary structures. It was observed that the root mean square
   deviation increased with a rise in temperature and application of
   external electric fields had no significant effect on it at any given
   temperatures. This study also demonstrated that exposure to external
   stresses including thermal and electric fields induces conformational
   changes in the protein structure, which may impact its physico-chemical
   properties.
   Industrial relevance:
   The work was performed to understand the influence of food processing on
   protein and the changes in their structure using molecular modeling
   concept.
   Molecular Dynamics Simulations have been applied to visualize the
   folding and unfolding of the protein structure depending on the amount
   of stress applied on the system.
   This work can help in modification and optimization of process
   parameters (like temperature and time) to enhance the protein functional
   properties and digestibility in the end product.
   Increasing digestibility would automatically result in higher
   nutritional absorption in the body, decreased immunoreactivity and
   overall better nutritional quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To determine the success of dental implants, mechanical stress
   distribution in the implant-bone interface is considered to be a
   determinant. Many researchers have used finite element modeling of
   implant-bone through applying static loading on the implant; however,
   dynamic loading has not extensively been investigated specially
   considering viscoelastic behavior of the bone. The aim of this study is
   to analyze effects of viscoelasticity of bone and dynamic loading
   comparable to mastication conditions on stress distribution in an
   implanted mandible. A three-dimensional finite-element model of an
   implanted mandible in the first molar region was constructed from
   computerized tomography data. Effects of several parameters, such as
   material properties including viscoelastic behavior of the cortical and
   trabecular bones, load amplitude, duration and direction on the
   instantaneous and long-term von Mises stress distribution of an
   implanted mandible were evaluated. In all loading conditions, the
   maximum von Mises stress occurred in cortical bone surrounding the neck
   of implant. Stress distribution was not noticeably affected by
   viscoelastic behavior during the first loading cycles, however, after
   100 s periodic loading, the differences between stress magnitudes
   (especially in the cortical bone) became noticeable. In addition,
   sensitivity analysis showed that both cortical and trabecular bones were
   more sensitive to axial load than buccalingual and mesiodistal forces.
   The results of this study contribute to analysis of parameters involved
   in success of dental implantation.}},

   secondary metabolites. Control cells showed higher abundances of enzymes
   and proteins related to nitrogen metabolism and assimilation, synthesis
   and utilization of starch, amino acid recycling, evidence of oxidative
   stress, and little lipid biosynthesis. This study of the eukaryotic
   microalgal proteome response to nitrogen source, availability, and
   switching highlights tightly controlled pathways essential to the
   maintenance of culture health and productivity in concert with light
   absorption and carbon assimilation. Enriched pathways in artificial
   wastewater, notably, photosynthetic carbon fixation and biosynthesis of
   plant hormones, and those in nitrate only control, most notably,
   nitrogen, amino acid, and starch metabolism, represent potential targets
   for genetic improvement requiring targeted elucidation.}},

Abstract = {{The reaction of a suspension of solid particles in a rapidly-heated
   oxidizing gas is relevant to metalized explosives and propellants, as
   well as to combustion of solid fuel-particle suspensions in
   premixed-gaseous-fuel clouds encountered in accidents within the mining
   and process industries. A simplified model is considered, using a
   constant-volume approximation, which assumes that non-volatile particles
   react heterogeneously via a one-step surface reaction. The resulting
   unified particle reaction rate includes both kinetic and diffusive
   reaction resistances. It is shown that the onset of the chemical
   reaction in a rapidly heated particulate suspension may occur by two
   different physical mechanisms. The first mechanism, realized in a dilute
   suspension of particles, is defined by the ignition of a single
   particle, i.e., by the critical phenomenon associated with the rapid
   transition from a kinetically- to diffusively-limited reaction regime.
   The second mechanism dominates the reaction onset in a dense particulate
   suspension and occurs in a similar manner to the reaction onset in a
   rapidly-heated homogeneous gas mixture, where the highly-activated
   reaction occurs in an explosion-like manner after some time delay and
   preheating. Unlike the single particle ignition phenomenon, the second
   mechanism lacks criticality and is not limited to particles above a
   certain size. The interplay between these two reaction-onset mechanisms
   leads to a nontrivial dependence of the total reaction time on the
   particle size and solid-fuel concentration within the suspension.}},

Journal = {{FOOD SECURITY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{835-856}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Growing populations and dietary shifts to include higher proportions of
   meat are projected to double global food demand by 2050. Previous global
   studies have proposed and evaluated possible solutions by closing
   agricultural yield gaps, defined as the difference between current and
   potential crop yields. We compliment previous studies by developing a
   method for more accurately calculating potential changes in cereal grain
   production under different irrigation scenarios, explicitly
   incorporating yield differences associated with different sources of
   irrigation. Irrigating with groundwater often leads to higher crop
   yields than irrigating with surface water because of the greater
   facility to tailor both the volumes of water and the timing of
   application. Two possible scenarios for increasing production in India
   are examined, the first where all non-irrigated fields are irrigated
   proportionally to the State-specific distribution of irrigation sources,
   and the second where all non-irrigated fields are irrigated with
   groundwater: Rice production increases by 14 and 25 \% in scenarios 1
   and 2 respectively, but wheat production increases by only 3 \% in both
   scenarios. Increased irrigation water consumption from irrigating fields
   that are currently non-irrigated is estimated at 31 \% for rice and 3 \%
   for wheat using the Global Crop Water Model. A third scenario estimates
   the potential loss in production without the use of irrigation: rice
   would be 75 \% and wheat 51 \% of current production. Our methodology
   and results can help policy makers estimate the current and potential
   contribution of irrigation sources to agricultural production and food
   security in India and can with facility be applied elsewhere.}},

Title = {{Aero-thermal optimization of in-flight electro-thermal ice protection
   systems in transient de-icing mode}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{167-182}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Even if electro-thermal ice protection systems (IPS) consume less energy
   when operating in de-icing mode than in anti-icing mode, they still need
   to be optimized for energy usage. The optimization, however, should also
   take into account the effect of the de-icing system on the aerodynamic
   performance. The present work offers an optimization framework in which
   both thermal and aerodynamic viewpoints are taken into account in
   formulating various objective and constraint functions by considering
   the energy consumption, the thickness, the volume, the shape and the
   location of the accreted ice on the surface as the key parameters
   affecting the energy usage and the aerodynamic performance. The design
   variables include the power density and the activation time of the
   electric heating blankets. A derivative-free technique, called the mesh
   adaptive direct search (MADS) method, is used to carry out the
   optimization process, which would normally need a large number of
   unsteady conjugate heat transfer (CHT) calculations for the IFS
   simulation. To avoid such prohibitive computations, reduced-order
   modeling (ROM) is used to construct simplified low-dimensional CHT
   models. The approach is illustrated through several test cases, in which
   different combinations of objective and constraint functions, design
   variables and cycling sequence patterns are examined. In these test
   cases, the energy consumption is significantly reduced compared to the
   experiments by improving the spatial and temporal distribution of the
   thermal energy usage. The results show the benefits of the approach in
   bringing energy, safety and aerodynamic considerations together in
   designing de-icing systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a combined magnetometer/accelerometer sharing a
   single surface micromachined structure. The device utilizes electrical
   current switching between two perpendicular directions on the structure
   to achieve a 2-D in-plane magnetic field measurement based on the
   Lorentz force. The device can concurrently serve as a 1-D accelerometer
   for out-of-plane acceleration, when the current is switched off.
   Accordingly, the proposed design is capable of separating magnetic and
   inertial force measurements, achieving higher accuracy through a single
   compact device. The sensor supports static operation at atmospheric
   pressure, precluding the need for complex vacuum packaging. It can
   alternatively operate at resonance under vacuum for enhanced
   sensitivity. The device is fabricated using a low-temperature surface
   micromachining technology, which is fully adapted for above-IC
   integration on standard CMOS substrates. The resonance frequency of one
   of the fabricated structures is measured to be 6.53 kHz with a quality
   factor of similar to 30 at a 10-mTorr ambient vacuum level. The magnetic
   field and acceleration sensitivities of the device are measured using
   discrete electronics to be 1.57 pF/T and 1.02 fF/g, respectively, under
   static operation.}},

Abstract = {{The final mechanical properties of wrought magnesium alloys are mostly
   controlled by its microstructure and crystallographic orientation or
   texture. In the sheet form of common magnesium alloys, grain coarsening
   occurs during annealing, which only serves to strengthen the undesirable
   basal texture. One method to alleviate this problem is by stopping grain
   coarsening. Hence the aim of this work is to investigate the effect of
   static precipitation on microstructure and texture evolution during
   annealing at various temperatures after cold rolling. Mg-Al-Sn alloys
   were designed using thermodynamic modeling software, FactSage(TM). It
   was found that static precipitates can only form extensively, after
   static recrystallization, at the recrystallized grain boundaries, and
   these retard grain growth during annealing. Presence of precipitates at
   the recrystallized grain boundaries also retard the strengthening of
   basal texture during annealing, related to grain coarsening. (C) The

   successful description of ternary Ti-C-O system for the first time. The
   liquid phase is described by the modified quasichemical model, which
   takes short-range ordering in liquid solution into account. All solid

Abstract = {{In decentralized control systems with linear dynamics, quadratic cost,
   and Gaussian disturbances (also called decentralized LQG systems) linear
   control strategies are not always optimal. Nonetheless, linear control
   strategies are appealing due to their analytic and implementation
   simplicity. In this paper, we investigate decentralized LQG systems with
   partial history sharing information structure and identify
   finite-dimensional sufficient statistics for such systems. Unlike prior
   work on decentralized LQG systems, we do not assume partial nestedness
   or quadratic invariance. Our approach is based on the common information
   approach of Nayyar et al., 2013 and exploits the linearity of the system
   dynamics and control strategies. To illustrate our methodology, we
   identify sufficient statistics for linear strategies in decentralized
   systems where controllers communicate over a strongly connected graph
   with finite delays, and for decentralized systems consisting of coupled
   subsystems with control sharing or one-sided one step delay sharing
   information structures.}},

Abstract = {{Newer approaches to characterizing hippocampal morphology can provide
   novel insights regarding cognitive function across the lifespan. We
   comprehensively assessed the relationships among age, hippocampal
   morphology, and hippocampal-dependent cognitive function in 137 healthy
   individuals across the adult lifespan (18-86 years of age). They
   underwent MRI, cognitive assessments and genotyping for Apolipoprotein E
   status. We measured hippocampal subfield volumes using a new multiatlas
   segmentation tool (MAGeT-Brain) and assessed vertex-wise (inward and
   outward displacements) and global surface-based descriptions of
   hippocampus morphology. We examined the effects of age on hippocampal
   morphology, as well as the relationship among age, hippocampal
   morphology, and episodic and working memory performance. Age and volume
   were modestly correlated across hippocampal subfields. Significant
   patterns of inward and outward displacement in hippocampal head and tail
   were associated with age. The first principal shape component of the
   left hippocampus, characterized by a lengthening of the antero-posterior
   axis was prominently associated with working memory performance across
   the adult lifespan. In contrast, no significant relationships were found
   among subfield volumes and cognitive performance. Our findings
   demonstrate that hippocampal shape plays a unique and important role in
   hippocampal-dependent cognitive aging across the adult lifespan,
   meriting consideration as a biomarker in strategies targeting the delay
   of cognitive aging. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3020-3037, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

Title = {{Paraffin Wax as a Sealant in Sorptivity Testing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The durability and sustainability of concrete structures is a prime
   socioeconomic concern of contemporary society. The lifecycle of these
   structures is typically determined by the rate of moisture ingress, in
   which dissolved and unwanted substances are transported into the
   structure. Therefore finding a sufficient means to measure these rates
   is of utmost importance. A sorptivity testing scheme as outlined by a
   commonly used standard can be a useful means of measuring how quickly
   liquid can be transported unidirectionally through concrete samples in
   the laboratory. Currently the standard prescribes that disc specimens
   100 mm in diameter and 50-mm thick be sealed in such a manner to ensure
   unidirectional flow through one, unsealed face of the sample, while all
   other surfaces are appropriately sealed. However the standard does not
   specify how this seal is to be achieved. Furthermore, differing methods
   have yielded a likewise array of varied results, which may not be
   representative of the true sorptivity. The objective of this paper is to
   propose a simple but effective means of sealing the specimens that will
   yield more consistent results, which are more representative of the
   actual absorption properties of the concrete. This was accomplished by
   studying the performance of electrical insulation tape and cellophane
   (as suggested in the standard) against paraffin wax using three
   different mixture designs, as follows: (1) involving normal strength
   concrete without air entrainment, (2) a normal strength concrete mixture
   with air entrapment, and (3) self-consolidating concrete without air
   entrapment. The prepared specimens were subjected to various freeze-thaw
   cycling periods, conditioned, and then tested for sorptivity. Batches of
   samples were exposed to freeze-thaw cycling periods of 0, 50, 100, 150,
   200, and 300 cycles. Within each group of samples, half of the specimens
   were sealed with electrical tape and cellophane, and the other half were
   sealed with paraffin wax in order to conduct sorptivity testing.
   Specimens coated in wax typically exhibited lower absorption values than
   those wrapped in tape. Furthermore, the tape would not adhere perfectly
   with the concrete at the edge formed by the cylindrical wall and the
   exposed surface, resulting in increased sorptivity values. Statistical
   analysis was done on the rates of early-age (0-6 h) and late-age (1-8
   days) sorptivity by using the F-test to examine variability (with an
   80\% confidence interval) and the student-t test was used to evaluate
   the significance of differences in sample means. Generally, sorptivity
   rates were higher for taped samples than those for waxed samples. These
   results further reinforced visual observations. The waxed samples
   yielded more reliable results primarily because they did not absorb
   moisture artificially along the sides in the manner as observed in the
   taped specimens. Moreover, the paraffin wax sealant method also resulted
   in less variability within test results. Therefore it was believed that
   the wax facilitated more representative results of the true sorptivity.
   It was suggested that the procedures of the common standard discussed in
   this paper should be refined such that the sealing of test specimens
   should be done with the use of paraffin wax, or some other similar
   substance, such as silicone, which is impermeable and readily available
   commercially. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Behavior of Rectangular Columns Constructed with SCC and Steel Fibers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Extensive research has shown that properly detailed and closely spaced
   transverse reinforcement in reinforced concrete columns can ensure
   ductile behavior during earthquakes. However, in regions of high
   seismicity, detailing requirements can result in heavily congested
   sections; the use of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) can facilitate
   construction in these situations. Although extensive research exists on
   the axial load behavior of traditional concrete columns, only limited
   research exists on the behavior of columns constructed with SCC.
   Research over the past two decades has also shown that use of steel
   fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) can improve the strength and ductility
   of columns by delaying cover spalling and improving core confinement.
   Recent research has also shown that the combined use of SCC and steel
   fibers can ease problems associated with the workability of traditional
   fiber-reinforced concrete. This paper presents the results from an
   experimental program that was conducted to study the axial behavior of
   reinforced concrete columns constructed with SCC and SFRC. Full-scale
   columns having rectangular cross sections were tested under pure axial
   compressive loading. The columns were detailed with varying amounts of
   transverse reinforcement in accordance with the requirements of the
   Canadian Standards Association. The results confirm that increasing
   confinement with closely spaced transverse reinforcement in rectangular
   SCC columns results in improvements in behavior and ductility. In
   addition, the results demonstrate that the use of SFRC in rectangular
   columns results in improvements in performance and ductility. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Bubble size is of fundamental importance in the flotation process, as it
   provides the surface area for particle collection. Typically, weak
   surfactants (frothers) are added to process water to reduce bubble
   coalescence. Certain inorganic electrolytes, which occur naturally in
   some flotation process water, have been shown to mimic the role of
   frothers. The concentration at which bubble coalescence is inhibited,
   the critical coalescence concentration, was determined in a 5.5-L
   mechanical flotation cell for a series of coalescence inhibiting
   inorganic salts. To mimic some industrial flotation process water, a
   synthetic sea salt solution was also tested. It was found that when the
   multicomponent sea salt solution was broken down into its constituent
   parts, the addition of the ionic strength of each ion correlated well
   with the overall ionic strength curve of all the salts tested. The
   critical coalescence ionic strength ranged from 0.22 to 0.35, with sea
   salt being 0.26. (c) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE

Abstract = {{The development of seismic microzonation maps is now a prerequisite for
   performing advanced seismic hazards and seismic risk assessments in
   urban areas. Current microzonation procedures are based on classifying
   site response in soil categories based on . In many practical cases,
   information on shear wave velocity is sparse and analysts must resort to
   other sources of information to develop zonation maps over large
   regions. For Montreal, Canada, a geostatistical approach combining a
   large dataset of boreholes, data from the H/V method, and a limited
   number of shear wave velocity measurements is proposed. Predictive
   equations are developed with the different types of information and
   partly used to create three different models: A first model based on the
   total thickness of soft soil deposits (One Layer Model), a second model
   based on stratigraphy obtained from borehole data (Four Layers Model)
   and a third model (Composite Model) that combines data from the previous
   two models with data from seismic surveys. Variability and uncertainty
   associated with the choice of the models are described and estimated
   using a second moment analysis. The composite model which combines
   borehole, and Vs data is shown to be the most accurate compared to
   models derived only from borehole and Vs data (an average reduction of
   40 \% of the squared error) and shows good agreement with the geological
   map for clay and sand locations with soils classes C and D (54 \%
   agreement on average). This approach opens new perspectives for
   microzonation in urban areas when budgets for Vs surveys are limited.}},

   considering the response at the particle scale level is a challenging

   strip footing over geogrid-reinforced sand and geogrid-reinforced fill
   over a strong formation containing void. The numerical model is first
   validated using experimental data and then used to provide new insights

Abstract = {{Two types of nano/micro sized mica powders for polymer composites,
   muscovite and phlogopite, were tested for their sound absorption
   capabilities. Acoustical performance was correlated to surface energy
   analysis and powder rheology testing. Inverse gas chromatography (iGC)
   was used to determine the surface energy, with the dominant component
   being the dispersive component. This reflected the nonpolar,
   hydrophobic, character of the micas. The determined yield locus and
   Mohr's circles indicated that the material with the highest packing
   density exhibited more free flowing powder characteristics, compared
   with the lower packing density materials, which exhibited a greater
   cohesive powder flow behaviour. All tested mica powders were sensitive
   to aeration and become fluidised. Based on the acoustical measurements
   the worst sound absorption performance was found for the highest packing
   density material exhibiting the highest magnitude of the longitudinal
   elastic coefficient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   microbeams}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{319-328}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, for the first time, the nonlinear motion characteristics
   of a hinged-hinged third-order shear deformable microbeam are examined,
   based on the modified couple stress theory and the third-order shear
   deformation theory. The extensibility of the microbeam is modelled by
   taking into account the longitudinal displacement. The nonlinear
   equations governing the longitudinal, transverse, and rotational motions
   are derived by means of Hamilton's principle in conjunction with the
   modified couple stress theory (to take into account small-scale
   effects). The three coupled nonlinear partial differential equations are
   discretized via the Galerkin method and the resulting set of ordinary
   differential equations is solved by means of the pseudo-arclength
   continuation technique and via direct time-integration. The effects of
   the system parameters on the behaviour of the microbeam are studied.
   Results are presented in the form of frequency-responses and
   force-responses. Points of interest in the parameter space are also
   highlighted in the form of time histories, phase-plane portraits, and
   fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). Moreover, the similarities and
   differences in the response of the system obtained via the modified
   couple stress and classical continuum mechanics theories are discussed.

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the problem of synthesis of spatial four-bar

   equations for CC and RC dyads are available in the literature, the
   synthesis of spatial RCCC four-bar linkages requires special attention,

   with the asymmetry, namely, the approximate nature of the RC dyad and
   the infinity of exact solutions of the CC dyad for the number of given
   poses. Our approach includes a robust formulation of the synthesis of CC
   dyads, for the determination of axis-congruences. Moreover, we formulate
   a uniform synthesis equation, which enables us to treat both RC and CC
   dyads, with properly selected constraints for both cases. Two design

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a framework for fully automatic gradient-based
   constrained aerodynamic shape optimization in a multirow turbomachinery
   environment. The concept of adjoint-based gradient calculation is
   discussed and the development of the discrete adjoint equations for a
   turbomachinery Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver,
   particularly the derivation of flow-consistent adjoint boundary
   conditions as well as the implementation of a discrete adjoint
   mixing-plane formulation, are described in detail. A parallelized,
   automatic grid perturbation scheme utilizing radial basis functions
   (RBFs), which is accurate and robust as well as able to handle highly
   resolved complex multiblock turbomachinery grid configurations, is
   developed and employed to calculate the gradient from the adjoint
   solution. The adjoint solver is validated by comparing its sensitivities
   with finite-difference gradients obtained from the flow solver. A
   sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is then utilized to
   determine an improved blade shape based on the gradient information from
   the objective functional and the constraints. The developed optimization
   method is used to redesign a single-stage transonic flow compressor in
   both inviscid and viscous flow. The design objective is to maximize the
   isentropic efficiency while constraining the mass flow rate and the
   total pressure ratio.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{193}},
Pages = {{38-48}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The computational efficiency of Finite Element Methods (FEMs) on
   parallel architectures is severely limited by conventional sparse
   iterative solvers. Conventional solvers are based on a sequence of
   global algebraic operations that limits their parallel efficiency.
   Traditionally, sophisticated programming techniques tailored to specific
   CPU architectures are used to improve the poor performance of sparse
   algebraic kernels. The introduced FEM Multigrid Gaussian Belief
   Propagation (FMGaBP) algorithm is a novel technique that eliminates all
   global algebraic operations and sparse data-structures. The algorithm is
   based on reformulating the FEM into a distributed variational inference
   problem on graphical models. We present new formulations for FMGaBP,
   which enhance its computation and communication complexities. A
   Helmholtz problem is used to validate the FMGaBP formulation for 2D, 3D
   and higher FEM degrees. Implementation techniques for multicore
   architectures that exploit the parallel features of FMGaBP are presented
   showing speedups compared to open-source libraries, specifically deal.II
   and Trilinos. FMGaBP is also implemented on manycore architectures in
   this work; Speedups of 4.8X, 2.3X and 1.5X are achieved on an NVIDIA
   Testa C2075 compared to the parallel CPU implementation of FMGaBP on
   dual-core, quad-core and 12-core CPUs respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The performance of a bipolar-design battery pack is studied numerically
   in terms of operating and design parameters of an active thermal

   window within which the pack is going to operate at various discharge
   rates is determined. It is found that 45, 22 and 7 stacks at the module
   level of the pack can be placed between the coolant plates with an
   average temperature less than 313 K with minimum cooling conditions for
   1 C, 2 C and 5 C-rate respectively. Higher coolant velocity and coolant
   plate thickness help in keeping the maximum temperature and temperature
   non-uniformity under control; however, doing so increases the parasitic

Abstract = {{Wood-fibre conformation affects paper properties in various
   paper-product categories, such as packaging, printing, and absorbents.
   Qualitative investigations suggest that capillary forces play a crucial
   role in determining the fibre conformation upon drying. To quantify this
   process, we theoretically and experimentally investigate deformation of
   a circular tube under capillary pressure. Fibre pit holes, which impose
   a significant capillary pressure while drying, are modelled as circular
   holes in a tube. The calculations are undertaken by coupling the
   analytical solution for buckling a circular tube to numerical solutions
   of the Young-Laplace equation. This elasto-capillary model elucidates
   the influences of wetting angle, tube-wall flexibility, and hole size on
   the tube deformation. In experiments, flexible silicon-rubber tubes with
   a hole in the wall are filled with liquid, and the internal pressure is
   measured while withdrawing this fluid, thus mimicking evaporation during
   the drying of wood fibres. The results prove that capillarity can
   collapse the fibre lumen, either partially or completely, depending
   principally on the fibre-wall flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{Curcumin (CCM) is a bioactive polyphenolic compound that suffers a low

   p-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) and nanoemulsion were used as carriers to

   digestion of beta-Lg-CCM and the nanoemulsion was studied using an in
   vitro gastrointestinal model. The effect of different carriers on the
   permeability of curcumin was assessed using the Caco-2 cell monolayer
   model. The results revealed that the water solubility and the pH
   stability of curcumin significantly increased by binding with beta-Lg.

   found to be resistant to pepsin digestion but sensitive to trypsin. In
   the permeability experiment it was shown that the digested nanoemulsion
   and beta-Lg-CCM improved significantly the permeation rate of curcumin.

Title = {{Scoring Tools for the Analysis of Infant Respiratory Inductive
   Plethysmography Signals}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Infants recovering from anesthesia are at risk of life threatening
   Postoperative Apnea (POA). POA events are rare, and so the study of POA
   requires the analysis of long cardiorespiratory records. Manual scoring
   is the preferred method of analysis for these data, but it is limited by
   low intra-and inter-scorer repeatability. Furthermore, recommended
   scoring rules do not provide a comprehensive description of the
   respiratory patterns. This work describes a set of manual scoring tools
   that address these limitations. These tools include: (i) a set of
   definitions and scoring rules for 6 mutually exclusive, unique patterns
   that fully characterize infant respiratory inductive plethysmography
   (RIP) signals; (ii) RIPScore, a graphical, manual scoring software to
   apply these rules to infant data; (iii) a library of data segments
   representing each of the 6 patterns; (iv) a fully automated, interactive
   formal training protocol to standardize the analysis and establish
   intra-and inter-scorer repeatability; and (v) a quality control method
   to monitor scorer ongoing performance over time. To evaluate these
   tools, three scorers from varied backgrounds were recruited and trained
   to reach a performance level similar to that of an expert. These scorers
   used RIPScore to analyze data from infants at risk of POA in two
   separate, independent instances. Scorers performed with high accuracy
   and consistency, analyzed data efficiently, had very good intra-and
   inter-scorer repeatability, and exhibited only minor confusion between
   patterns. These results indicate that our tools represent an excellent
   method for the analysis of respiratory patterns in long data records.
   Although the tools were developed for the study of POA, their use
   extends to any study of respiratory patterns using RIP (e.g., sleep
   apnea, extubation readiness). Moreover, by establishing and monitoring
   scorer repeatability, our tools enable the analysis of large data sets
   by multiple scorers, which is essential for longitudinal and multicenter
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Muscovite mica is a naturally occurring phyllosilicate mineral with a
   wide range of industrial applications. This work investigated the
   separation of muscovite from unwanted gangue minerals in a mica ore.
   Electroacoustic zeta potential measurements and single mineral flotation
   tests were used to determine the effect of Custamine 8113 (collector)
   and Norlig-H (depressant) on muscovite. These results were then compared
   to those of gangue minerals (feldspar and quartz). Muscovite showed an
   isoelectric point (IEP) at pH 3.5. Feldspar and quartz did not have an
   IEP, having negative zeta potentials over the pH range investigated (pH
   3-10). This suggests that effective separation using a cationic amine
   collector, which relies on electrostatic attraction as the basic
   mechanism of adsorption onto mineral surfaces, would not be possible
   without the use of a depressant. Zeta potential measurements and single
   mineral flotation tests in the presence of both Custamine 8113 and
   Norlig-H indicate that reagent adsorption is controlled by Custamine
   8113 in the case of muscovite and by Norlig-H in the case of feldspar
   and quartz. This suggests that effective separation of muscovite from
   the gangue minerals present in the mica ore is possible. These results
   were used to determine optimal flotation conditions of the ore.
   Concentrates from the ore flotation were examined by QEMSCAN analysis,
   which showed that muscovite was effectively separated from gangue
   minerals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a novel method to fabricate Si nanocrystals in a

   separation by annealing a Si-rich SiO2 film at 1100 degrees C; we show
   Si nanocrystal formation in as-deposited films at 550 degrees C. We
   suggest the mechanism for this is through surface diffusion during
   deposition. We also show the ability to vary the size of these
   nanocrystals by adjusting the deposition conditions and can increase
   their size through annealing. If the nanocrystals are small they have
   excellent photoluminescence properties however larger nanocrystals have
   poor luminescence.}},

Pages = {{149-166}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, some experiments are described which were designed to
   illustrate the dynamical behaviour of towed flexible cylinders and to
   test the theory. A silicone rubber cylinder was manufactured such that
   it was almost neutrally buoyant when immersed in water. The cylinder was
   terminated by plexiglas end-pieces and was held in horizontal water flow
   by a length of nylon thread (towrope). Video capturing along with image
   processing techniques were used to measure the transverse displacement
   of the cylinder in the horizontal plane. For the cylinder with
   relatively streamlined nose and tail end pieces, non-flexural (rigid
   body), as well as flexural instabilities developed as the flow velocity
   was increased; shortening the towrope was not very effective for
   stabilizing the system, but a sufficiently blunt tail end piece had a
   very significant stabilizing effect. The experimental observations are
   generally in qualitative agreement with the available nonlinear theory.
   Quantitative comparison of various quantities, e.g the instability
   thresholds, between experiment and theory, based on the estimated values
   of some of the theoretical nondimensional parameters, is also fairly
   good. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{348}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the numerical investigation of the unilateral
   contact induced dynamics of a turbomachine blade rotating within a
   perfectly rigid yet distorted casing. This investigation is motivated by
   unelucidated vibratory behaviours observed experimentally. The
   simulations are based on an in-house time marching strategy
   incorporating Lagrange multipliers for the unilateral contact treatment,
   as well as centrifugal stiffening and abradable coating removal.
   Significant extensions are proposed through the implementation of (1)
   aerodynamic loading on the blade and (2) post processing techniques
   involving the empirical mode decomposition which provides fruitful
   insights on important transient phenomena. A thorough bifurcation
   analysis with and without aerodynamic loading highlights the existence
   of flip bifurcations with period doubling and period halving sequences
   over a broad angular speed range. Numerical simulations with external
   aerodynamic loading yield quasi periodic and likely to be chaotic
   motions that could nor be observed under vacuum. The proposed numerical
   investigations underline the key role of the aerodynamic loading in the
   blade dynamics and suggest that unexplained experimental vibratory
   behaviours are related to the vacuum conditions of the experiment. (C)

Abstract = {{This contribution addresses the vibratory analysis of unilateral contact
   induced structural interactions between a bladed impeller and its
   surrounding flexible casing. It extends the numerical developments
   exposed in a previous paper to flexible casings. The casing finite
   element model and the construction of the associated reduced-order model
   for efficient computations are first exposed in detail along with an
   extensive presentation of the smoothing strategy implemented on the
   contact interface. The proposed algorithms embedding unilateral contact
   conditions together with abradable coating removal are subsequently
   introduced and validated through a systematic analysis of (1) the
   nonlinear procedure for the computation of impeller/casing distances,
   (2) the treatment of three-dimensional friction and contact forces, (3)
   the correction of the displacements when unilateral contact or abradable
   removal arises, and (4) the possible hybrid contact scenarii involving
   localized total removal of the abradable coating. Finally, two
   illustrative case studies show that the linear interaction condition,
   commonly considered for the safe design of impellers and casings in
   turbomachinery, may be advantageously combined with the presented
   numerical strategy in order to assess the actual importance of predicted
   critical speeds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL 17}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and peptide
   conjugation on the biodistribution of ultrasmall (2.7 nm) gold
   nanoparticles in mice bearing B16 melanoma allografts. Nanoparticles
   were delivered intravenously, and biodistribution was measured at
   specific timepoints by organ digestion and inductively coupled plasma
   mass spectrometry. All major organs were examined. Two peptides were
   tested: the cyclic RGD peptide (cRGD, which targets integrins); and a
   recently described peptide derived from the myxoma virus. We found the
   greatest specific tumor delivery using the myxoma peptide, with or
   without PEGylation. Un-PEGylated cRGD performed poorly, but PEGylated
   RGD showed a significant transient collection in the tumor. Liver and
   kidney were the primary targets of all constructs. None of the particles
   were able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Although it was able to
   deliver Au to B16 cells, the myxoma peptide did not show any cytotoxic
   activity against these cells, in contrast to previous reports. These
   results indicate that the effect of passive targeting by PEGylation and
   active targeting by peptides can be independent or combined, and that
   they should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis when designing new
   nanosystems for targeted therapies. Both myxoma peptide and cRGD should
   be considered for specific targeting to melanoma, but a thorough
   investigation of the cytotoxicity of the myxoma peptide to different
   cell lines remains to be performed.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical interventions are used to manage severe complications of heart
   valve diseases and to prevent the eventual rupture of an aortic
   aneurysm. Soft-tissue allografts, xenografts, and prosthetic grafts are
   used in these interventions; however, there are pre-surgical
   difficulties and post-surgical complications in using these grafts. One
   of these is the rupture potential of cryopreserved allografts at the
   time of transplantation and/or after the thawing process for the
   cryopreserved tissue. Moreover, a number of clinical observations report
   the patency of prosthetic grafts and aneurysm of cryopreserved
   allografts after the transplantation. This work aims to study the effect
   of cryopreservation on the resistance of arterial tissue to crack growth
   and propagation; we examined the biomechanical parameters which could be
   used in designing more efficient prosthetic grafts. Investigation of the
   toughness properties can also be helpful to understand the failure
   mechanisms of pathological arterial tissues. The toughness and biaxial
   tensile properties of the post-cryopreserved and fresh arteries have

Abstract = {{In this study, a formulation of thermodynamic systems in terms of
   contact geometry is proposed. Furthermore, a systematic approach to the
   description and analysis of composite thermodynamic systems, that is,
   systems containing a number of interacting thermodynamic subsystems, is
   developed. In such systems, there are always heat, work or matter flows
   between the subsystems which, together with constructive restrictions,
   form the interconnection structure of the composite system. This
   structure can be described by a set of constraints imposed on the
   system. In geometric terms, this can be seen as a restriction of the
   system space to a certain `constraint sub-manifold'. Moreover, there are
   kinematic (non-holonomic) constraints which restrict the system's
   dynamics while imposing no restrictions on the system configuration.
   Both geometric and kinematic constraints and their influence on the
   dynamics of the composite system are discussed. Finally, several types
   of composite thermodynamic system are presented and the LaSalle
   Invariance Principle is used to analyse the asymptotic dynamical
   behaviour of one important example.}},

Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Oxidoreductase enzymes have the potential to be used to catalyze the
   oxidation of aromatic trace contaminants in wastewaters. The feasibility
   of this approach can be explored by modeling transient kinetics,
   particularly in the low substrate concentration range, where the model
   may be used to predict the quantity of enzyme and time required to
   achieve a particular level of conversion of a target compound. Laccase
   from Trametes versicolor was selected as a candidate enzyme due to its
   wide substrate specificity and its use of molecular oxygen as an
   oxidant. Phenol was selected as a target substrate. A four-parameter
   kinetic model was developed based on the known reactions of laccase. The
   model was applied to 30 sets of data collected from batch reactions
   conducted at pH 5 and 25 degrees C over a three hour period. Initial
   phenol concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 50 mu M and applied enzyme
   concentrations ranged from 0.12 to 2.5 mu M. The model demonstrated its
   utility for predicting the quantities of enzyme and reaction times
   required to achieve desired levels of oxidation of phenol for varying
   initial concentrations. A three-parameter simplified version of the
   kinetic model was also developed to facilitate calibration and
   mathematical solution of its equations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{High content arsenic waste generated in the metallurgical industry can
   be converted into a synthetic mineral, scorodite, FeAsO4 center dot
   2H(2)O, and deposited into a landfill site. Scorodite is most stable in
   weakly acidic to neutral pH range under oxic conditions. A novel way to
   enhance the range of stability for scorodite is to encapsulate it with
   an inert material. In this work, silicate gel is developed and
   investigated as a possible encapsulating material for scorodite. The
   initial method of gel formation in this study produced a silicate gel
   with high alkalinity (pH 10) that was incompatible with scorodite. A
   reverse titration method was developed producing a gel with optimum pH
   profile (5-6.5). This technique proved to have only marginal effect on
   scorodite stabilization prompting an investigation of different ageing
   techniques (drying; 22, 44 degrees C and hydrothermal treatment; 110,
   160 degrees C) as a means of producing silica-like coatings with better
   stabilization potential. Interestingly most of these measures proved
   counterproductive as aged scorogels showed a higher release of As than
   scorodite alone. Through surface-sensitive depth profile analysis (XPS),
   and molecular-sensitive analysis (Raman and FTIR mapping), it was
   discovered that the silicate engaged into an ``ion-exchange{''} type
   reaction on the surface of scorodite by bonding to iron, hence the
   observed release of arsenic. Development of a hydrothermally-induced
   iron silicate layer may lead to an effective encapsulant. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Attributable to their low chemical durability, borate-based glasses have
   been demonstrated to convert rapidly to hydroxy-carbonated apatite
   (HCA), the inorganic component of bone. However, the effect of sol-gel
   processing on the bioactivity of borate-based glasses has not been
   investigated. In this study, the gel and glass forming abilities of six
   different borate-based glass formulations with borate content ranging
   from 36 to 61 mol \% and based on a previously studied four component
   melt-derived glass system {[}(46.1)B2O3-(26.9)CaO-(24.4)Na2O-(2.6)P2O3;
   mol \%] were investigated. Compared to melt-quench, sol-gel processing
   fabricated nanoporous glass particles with at least 2 orders of
   magnitude greater values for specific surface areas and total pore
   volumes, which translated to dramatically higher aqueous interaction and
   ion release rates. Surprisingly, when immersed in simulated body fluid,
   HCA conversion was achieved in as little as 3 h for sol-gel derived
   borate based glasses, demonstrating a 25-fold increase in mineralization
   rate when compared to melt derived equivalents. The ability of the
   sol-gel derived borate-based glasses to rapidly convert to bone-like HCA
   holds promise in numerous potential tissue engineering applications,
   including the repair and augmentation of mineralized tissues.}},

Title = {{Two-Aperture Microfluidic Probes as Flow Dipole: Theory and Applications}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{A microfluidic probe (MFP) is a mobile channel-less microfluidic system
   under which a fluid is injected from an aperture into an open space,
   hydrodynamically confined by a surrounding fluid, and entirely
   re-aspirated into a second aperture. Various MFPs have been developed,
   and have been used for applications ranging from surface patterning of
   photoresists to local perfusion of organotypic tissue slices. However,
   the hydrodynamic and mass transfer properties of the flow under the MFP
   have not been analyzed, and the flow parameters are adjusted
   empirically. Here, we present an analytical model describing the key
   transport properties in MFP operation, including the dimensions of the
   hydrodynamic flow confinement (HFC) area, diffusion broadening, and
   shear stress as a function of: (i) probe geometry (ii)
   aspiration-to-injection flow rate ratio (iii) gap between MFP and
   substrate and (iv) reagent diffusivity. Analytical results and scaling
   laws were validated against numerical simulations and experimental
   results from published data. These results will be useful to guide
   future MFP design and operation, notably to control the MFP ``brush
   stroke{''} while preserving shear-sensitive cells and tissues.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of the gravity framing system on the
   overstrength and collapse risk of steel frame buildings with perimeter
   special moment frames (SMFs) designed in North America. A nonlinear
   analytical model that simulates the pinched hysteretic response of
   typical shear tab connections is calibrated with past experimental data.
   The proposed modeling approach is implemented into nonlinear analytical
   models of archetype steel buildings with different heights. It is found
   that when the gravity framing is considered as part of the analytical
   model, the overall base shear strength of steel frame buildings with
   perimeter SMFs could be 50\% larger than that of the bare SMFs. This is
   attributed to the gravity framing as well as the composite action
   provided by the concrete slab. The same analytical models (i) achieve a
   static overstrength factor, (s) larger than 3.0 and (ii) pass the
   collapse risk evaluation criteria by FEMA P695 regardless of the
   assigned total system uncertainty. However, when more precise collapse
   metrics are considered for collapse risk assessment of steel frame
   buildings with perimeter SMFs, a tolerable probability of collapse is
   only achieved in a return period of 50years when the perimeter SMFs of
   mid-rise steel buildings are designed with a strong-column/weak-beam
   ratio larger than 1.5. The concept of the dynamic overstrength, (d) is
   introduced that captures the inelastic force redistribution due to
   dynamic loading. Steel frame buildings with perimeter SMFs achieve a
   (d)>3 regardless if the gravity framing is considered as part of the
   nonlinear analytical model representation. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley

Title = {{Development of polylactide bead foams with double crystal melting peaks}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{83-94}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we report the development of polylactide (PLA) bead foams
   with a double crystal melting peak structure. PLA bead foams with 3- to
   30-fold expansion ratios and average cell sizes ranged from 350 nm to 15
   mu m were prepared. We found that the PLA's foam structure was
   significantly affected by the amount of perfected crystals (that is,
   crystals with a high melting temperature) generated during CO2
   saturation. The structure was also affected by crystals with a low
   melting temperature that formed during foaming and cooling. Various CO2
   pressures further influenced the crystallization kinetics of the
   crystals with a high melting temperature during the saturation. At
   various pressures, different crystallization kinetics also significantly
   affected the PLA foam's cell morphology and its uniformity. At a high
   saturation pressure, the increased content of dissolved CO2 in the PLA
   promoted the cell nucleation rate through the increased degree of
   thermodynamic instability. On the other hand, at high pressures,
   small-sized perfect crystals were induced as high-melting peak crystals.
   Thus, the heterogeneous cell nucleation around these crystals was
   further improved, which also caused the generation of a more uniform
   foam structure. Moreover, this study introduces this bead foam
   technology as an innovative new way to produce nanocellular foam
   products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An elastocapillary model for drying-induced collapse is proposed. We
   consider a circular elastic membrane with a hole at the centre that is
   deformed by the capillary pressure of simply and doubly connected
   menisci. The membrane overlays a cylindrical cavity with rigid walls,
   trapping a prescribed volume of water. This geometry may be suitable for
   studying structural failures and stiction in micro-electromechanical
   systems during wet etching, where capillary surfaces experience
   catastrophic transitions. The dry state is determined using the
   dihedral-angle and volume-turning-point stability criteria. Open and
   collapsed conformations are predicted from the scaled hole radius,
   cavity aspect ratio, meniscus contact angle with the membrane and cavity
   walls, and an elastocapillary number measuring the membrane stretching
   rigidity relative to the water surface tension. For a given scaled hole
   radius and cavity aspect ratio, there is a critical elastocapillary
   number above which the system does not collapse upon drying. The
   critical elastocapillary number is weakly influenced by the contact
   angle over a wide range of the scaled hole radius, thus indicating a
   limitation of surface hydrophobization for controlling the dry-state
   conformation. The model is applied to the drying of wood fibres above
   the fibre saturation point, determining the conditions leading to
   collapse.}},

Abstract = {{The facile iodination of aromatic compounds under mild conditions is a
   great challenge for both organic and medicinal chemistry. Particularly,
   the synthesis of functionalized aryl iodides by light has long been
   considered impossible due to their photo-lability, which actually makes
   aryl iodides popular starting materials in many photo-substitution
   reactions. Herein, a photoinduced halogen exchange in aryl or vinyl
   halides has been discovered for the first time. A broad scope of aryl
   iodides can be prepared in high yields at room temperature under
   exceptionally mild conditions without any metal or photo-redox
   catalysts. The presence of a catalytic amount of elemental iodine could
   promote the reaction significantly.}},

Abstract = {{The single-collector contact efficiency (eta(0)) for physicochemical
   colloid filtration under horizontal flow in saturated porous media was
   calculated using trajectory analysis in. three dimensions. Past studies
   have developed correlation equations for colloids with densities dose to
   that of water, such as bacteria and latex particles: A. new correlation
   equation was developed for predicting eta(0) based on a large number of
   trajectory simulations to account for higher-density particles
   representative of metal colloids. The correlation equation was developed
   by assuming Brownian diffusion, interception, and gravitational
   sedimentation contributed to eta(0) in an additive manner. Numerical
   simulations for colloid trajectory analysis used for calculating eta(0)
   were based on horizontal flow around a collector under the action of van
   der Waals attractive forces, gravity, and hydrodynamic forces as well as
   Brownian motion. The derived correlation equation shows excellent
   agreement with existing correlation equations for particles with density
   close to that of water. However, the correlation equation presented in
   this study shows that eta(0) of high-density colloids, such as metal
   particles, transported under horizontal flow deviates from that
   predicted by existing correlations for colloids larger than 4 mu m and
   under low approach velocities. Simulations of trajectory paths show that
   a significantly reduced contact of high-density colloids larger than 4
   mu m in size with a collector is to gravity forces causing trajectory
   paths to deviate away from the underside of collectors. The new
   correlation equation is suitable for predicting the single collector
   efficiency of large particles (several hundred nanometers to several
   micrometers) and with a large amount of density transport in the
   horizontal flow mode but is unsuitable for particles with a quite small
   size (several to tens of nanometers) and for the particle with a large
   amount of density flow in the vertical flow mode. The trajectory
   analysis was conducted for particles under favorable deposition
   conditions.}},

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{The coordinated delivery of minute amounts of different reagents is
   important for microfluidics and microarrays, but is dependent on
   advanced equipment such as microarrayers. Previously, we developed the
   snap chip for the direct transfer of reagents, thus realizing fluidic
   operations by only manipulating microscope slides. However, owing to the
   misalignment between arrays spotted on different slides, millimeter
   spacing was needed between spots and the array density was limited. In
   this work, we have developed a novel double transfer method and have
   transferred 625 spots cm(-2), corresponding to >10000 spots for a
   standard microscope slide. A user-friendly snapping system was
   manufactured to make liquid handling straightforward. Misalignment,
   which for direct transfer ranged from 150-250 mu m, was reduced to <40
   mu m for double transfer. The snap chip was used to quantify 50 proteins
   in 16 samples simultaneously, yielding limits of detection in the pg/mL
   range for 35 proteins. The versatility of the snap chip is illustrated
   with a 4-plex homogenous enzyme inhibition assay analyzing 128
   conditions with precise timing. The versatility and high density of the
   snap chip with double transfer allows for the development of high
   throughput reagent transfer protocols compatible with a variety of
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, two passive techniques are simultaneously investigated
   for heat transfer improvement (i.e. chaotic advection and nanofluids) in
   coiled heat exchangers. Performance of these two different coils (one
   with normal configuration and another with chaotic configuration) is
   numerically analyzed and compared for both water and nanofluid as fluid.
   Effects of different parameters such as geometry, types of nanofluids,
   nanoparticle volumetric concentration and Reynolds number on heat
   transfer and pressure drop are studied. The CuO and Al2O3 base water
   nanofluids with different nanoparticle concentrations 1-3\% were
   simulated. Equations of conservation of mass, momentum and energy were
   discretized using a finite element based technique and were solved using
   ANSYS software. Numerical results showed that heat transfer in the
   chaotic coil with water as fluid was higher than that in the normal coil
   with nanofluids at various volumetric concentrations and addition small
   amount of nanofluid in the chaotic coil flow resulted in significant
   enhancement of heat transfer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   (NWs) with and without Rh/Cr2O3 nanoparticle (NP) decoration have been

   the TA profiles between InGaN/GaN and InGaN/GaN-Rh/Cr2O3 NWs, an
   additional decay component on the medium time scale (similar to 50 ps)
   was identified with Rh/Cr2O3 decoration, which is attributed to
   interfacial charge transfer from InGaN/GaN NWs to Rh/Cr2O3 NPs, desired
   for light energy conversion applications. This is consistent with
   reduced photoluminescence (PL) of the NWs by the Rh/Cr2O3 NPs. A kinetic
   model was developed to explain the TA results and gain further insight
   into the exciton and charge-carrier dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, a low-head direct chill (DC) industrial-scale
   caster for rolling ingots has been modelled using the advanced
   computational fluid dynamics approach. Specifically, the 3-D coupled
   turbulent melt flow and solidification heat transfer in a slab caster
   has been modelled for the aluminium AA4045 alloy. The turbulence
   generated in the melt pool is taken into account in the model through
   the implementation of a popular low-Reynolds (Re) number version of the
   k-e eddy viscosity model. The solidification heat transfer for this
   complex opaque system has been considered through the employment of the
   well-known `enthalpy-porosity' scheme. A staggered control-volume
   (CV)-based finite-difference scheme is used to discretise the governing
   transport equations and the associated boundary conditions. The
   discretised algebraic equations are then solved sequentially using the
   tridiagonal matrix algorithm with implicit under-relaxation factors. The
   SIMPLE algorithm was employed to resolve the velocity-pressure couplings
   in the momentum equations. Three important process parameters of this
   casting problem, namely, the casting speed, the pouring temperature
   (inlet melt superheat), and the convective heat transfer coefficient
   (HTC) at the metal-mould interface for the low-head 30-mm mould, are
   varied in their corresponding practical range of 60-180 mm min1, 16-64
   degrees C and 1000-4000 W m(2)degrees C, respectively. The predicted
   results are presented in the form of velocity and temperature fields,
   solid shell thickness at the mould exit, as well as the sump depth and
   mushy-region thickness at the centre of the ingot. The obtained results
   are then critically discussed.}},

Title = {{Analyzing the continuum of fatal crashes: A generalized ordered approach}},
Journal = {{ANALYTIC METHODS IN ACCIDENT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In the United States, safety researchers have focused on examining fatal
   crashes (involving at least one fatally injured vehicle occupant) by
   using Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset. FARS database
   compiles crashes if at least one person involved in the crash dies
   within 30 consecutive days from the time of crash along with the exact
   timeline of the fatal occurrence. Previous studies using FARS clataset
   offer many useful insights on what factors affect crash related
   fatality, particularly in the context of fatal vs. non fatal injury
   categorization. However, there is one aspect of fatal crashes that has
   received scarce attention in the traditional safety analysis. The
   studies that dichotomize crashes into fatal vs. non fatal groups assume
   that all fatal crashes in the FARS dataset arc similar. Keeping all else
   same, a fatal crash that results in an immediate Fatality is clearly
   much more severe than another crash that leads to Fatality after several
   days. Our study contributes to continuing research on Fatal crashes.
   Specifically, rather than homogenizing all fatal crashes as the same,
   our study analyzes the Fatal injury from a new perspective by examining
   Fatality as a continuous spectrum based On survival time ranging from
   dying within 30 days of crash to dying instantly (as reported in the
   FARS data). The Fatality continuum is represented as a discrete ordered
   dependent variable and analyzed using the mixed generalized ordered
   logit (MGOL) model. By doing so, we expect to provide a more accurate
   estimation of critical crash attributes that contribute to death. In
   modeling the discretized fatality timeline, the Emergency Medical
   Service (EMS) response time variable is an important determinant.
   However, it is possible that the EMS response time and fatality timeline
   are influenced by the same set of observed and unobserved factors,
   generating endogeneity in the outcome variable of interest. Hence, we
   propose to estimate a two equation model that comprises of a regression
   equation for EMS response time and MGOL for fatality continuum with
   residuals from the EMS model to correct for endogeneity bias on the
   effect of exogenous factors on the timeline of death. Such research
   attempts are useful in determining what factors affect the time between
   crash occurrence and time of death so that safety measures can be
   implemented to prolong survival. The model estimates are augmented by
   conducting elasticity analysis to highlight the important factors
   affecting time-to-death process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
