Abstract = {{Human pancreatic islets are seldom assessed for dynamic responses to
   external stimuli. Thus, the elucidation of human islet functionality
   would provide insights into the progression of diabetes mellitus,
   evaluation of preparations for clinical transplantation, as well as for
   the development of novel therapeutics. The objective of this study was
   to develop a microfluidic platform for in vitro islet culture, allowing
   the multi-parametric investigation of islet response to chemical and
   biochemical stimuli. This was accomplished through the fabrication and
   implementation of a microfluidic platform that allowed the perifusion of
   islet culture while integrating real-time monitoring using impedance
   spectroscopy, through microfabricated, interdigitated electrodes located
   along the microchamber arrays. Real-time impedance measurements provide
   important dielectric parameters, such as cell membrane capacitance and
   cytoplasmic conductivity, representing proliferation, differentiation,
   viability, and functionality. The perifusion of varying glucose
   concentrations and monitoring of the resulting impedance of pancreatic
   islets were performed as proof-of-concept validation of the lab-on-chip
   platform. This novel technique to elucidate the underlying mechanisms
   that dictate islet functionality is presented, providing new information
   regarding islet function that could improve the evaluation of islet
   preparations for transplantation. In addition, it will lead to a better
   understanding of fundamental diabetes-related islet dysfunction and the
   development of therapeutics through evaluation of potential drug
   effects. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In the present investigation, laminar burning velocities (LBVs) were
   measured for several different silane fuels (i.e., trichlorosilane,
   trimethylchlorosilane, methyldichlorosilane, dimethylchlorosilane, and
   tetramethylsilane) in order to evaluate their potential for vapour cloud
   explosions (VCEs). Laminar burning velocities were determined from
   constant-volume explosions in a closed vessel; the pressure rise of the
   initial portion of flame propagation was used to calculate the laminar
   burning velocity. The LBVs for the different silane compounds were found
   to be in the range of 43 cm/s (for dimethylchlorosilane) to 124 cm/s
   (for trichlorosilane). These values were then used to estimate blast
   effects of VCEs resulting from a 25,000 kg release of each fuel. In
   particular, the VCE severity of trichlorosilane was compared to that of
   propane and ethylene for a given release mass. It was found that a
   trichlorosilane VCE would produce greater overpressures than propane and
   ethylene in the near field but the pressure would decay more rapidly
   with increasing distance from the explosion centre. Moreover, the
   impulse from a trichlorosilane VCE would be considerably lower than that
   of propane and ethylene. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Black phosphorus (bP) is the second known elemental allotrope with a
   layered crystal structure that can be mechanically exfoliated to atomic
   layer thickness. Unlike metallic graphite and semi-metallic graphene, bP
   is a semiconductor in both bulk and few-layer form. Here we fabricate
   bP-naked quantum wells in a back-gated field effect transistor geometry
   with bP thicknesses ranging from 6 +/- 1 nm to 47 +/- 1 nm. Using a
   polymer encapsulant, we suppress bP oxidation and observe field effect
   mobilities up to 900 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) and on/off current ratios exceeding
   10(5). Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations observed in magnetic fields up to
   35 T reveal a 2D hole gas with Schrodinger fermion character in a
   surface accumulation layer. Our work demonstrates that 2D electronic
   structure and 2D atomic structure are independent. 2D carrier
   confinement can be achieved without approaching atomic layer thickness,
   advantageous for materials that become increasingly reactive in the
   few-layer limit such as bP.}},

Abstract = {{The periodontal ligament (PDL) has a reservoir of mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) and this tissue is easily available following teeth removal
   procedures. However, PDL-derived cells (PDLCs) availability for tissue
   engineering is limited because they are heterogeneous cells at various
   differentiation and lineage commitments. Therefore, efficient culture
   conditions to increase MSCs number are needed to use PDLCs in tissue
   engineering. Recent reports indicate that low-oxygen conditions
   amplified stem/progenitor cell numbers and inhibited cell
   differentiation. Our aim was to establish which low-oxygen culture
   conditions favored bone or tendon/ligament regeneration in cultured
   PDLCs. Human PDLCs were cultured and exposed to either hypoxic (O-2 <=
   5\%) or anoxic (O-2 < 0.1\%) oxygen conditions in low-glucose/serum-free
   media for 24 hours. After 24 h, as expected, cell survival was
   significantly less in PDLCs exposed to anoxic conditions as compared
   with cells under normal or hypoxic conditions. PDLCs exposed to hypoxic
   conditions had the highest percentages for MSC markers (CD105, CD166,
   Stro-1). For both hypoxic and anoxic conditions, stem cell marker genes
   (oct4, sox2, p75) were upregulated after 6 h. At 24 h, these stem cell
   markers were maintained in PDLCs under hypoxic condition. Interestingly
   under anoxic conditions, expression of scleraxis gene (a key
   transcription factor for tendo/ligamentogenesis) was upregulated
   markedly. When hypoxic PDLCs were subcultured into osteogenic medium, in
   vitro calcification and prominent in vivo bone formation in mice
   calvaria were observed. When anoxic PDLCs were subcultured into
   tendo/ligamentogenic medium, expression of aggrecan (a mature tenogenic
   gene) increased remarkably. No obvious differences were detectable on
   chondrogenic and adipogenic inducibilities. We propose that transient
   exposure to low-oxygen during the culture enhanced MSC population in
   PDL. In addition, different low-oxygen concentrations favored osteogenic
   or tendo/ligamentogenic inducibilities of cultured PDLCs.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a unified approach to transceiver optimization for
   nonregenerative multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relay networks.
   This approach leads to new transceiver designs and reduces algorithmic
   complexity with adaptive implementations. First, we formulate a generic
   system model that accommodates various network topologies by imposing
   structural constraints on the source precoder, the relaying matrix, and
   the destination equalizer. Based on the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE)
   criterion, we derive the optimal relaying matrix as a function of the
   other two matrices, thereby freeing the optimization problem from this
   matrix and its associated power constraint with no loss of optimality.
   Subsequently, we study how to optimize either the precoder or the
   equalizer under different structural constraints and propose an
   alternating algorithm for the joint design. When optimizing the
   equalizer, the optimum from the previous transmission block is chosen as
   the initial search point to speed up convergence and, hence, to reduce
   computational complexity. The proposed framework is further explained
   and numerically validated within the context of different system
   configurations.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear vibrations of plates in axial pulsating flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{33-55}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A theoretical approach is presented to study nonlinear vibrations of
   thin infinitely long and wide rectangular plates subjected to pulsatile
   axial inviscid flow. The flow is set in motion by a pulsating pressure
   gradient. The case of plates in axial uniform flow under the action of
   constant transmural pressure is also addressed for different flow
   velocities. The plate is assumed to be periodically simply supported in
   both in-plane directions with immovable edges and the flow channel is
   bounded by a rigid wall. In this way the system under study is a finite
   rectangular plate with conditions on the fluid and the plate boundaries
   coming from the periodicity of the infinite system. The equations of
   motion are obtained based on the von Karman nonlinear plate theory
   retaining in-plane inertia via Lagrangian approach. The fluid model is
   based on the potential flow theory. The resulting Lagrange equations of
   motion of the coupled system contain quadratic and cubic nonlinear terms
   and are studied by using a code based on the pseudo-arc-length
   continuation and collocation scheme. The effect of different system
   parameters such as flow velocity, pulsation amplitude, pulsation
   frequency and channel pressurization on the stability of the plate and
   its geometrically nonlinear response to pulsating flow are fully
   discussed. It has been found that the presence of positive transmural
   uniform pressure and small pulsation frequency would destroy the
   pitchfork bifurcation (divergence) that flat plates exhibit when
   subjected to uniform flow. Moreover, in case of zero uniform transmural
   pressure numerical results show a hardening type behavior for the entire
   flow velocity range when the pulsation frequency is spanned in the
   neighborhood of the plate's fundamental frequency. On the contrary, a
   softening type behavior is presented when a uniform transmural pressure
   is introduced. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In two earlier case-control studies conducted in Montreal, nitrogen
   dioxide (NO2), a marker for traffic-related air pollution was found to
   be associated with the incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer and
   prostate cancer. These studies relied on a land use regression model
   (LUR) for NO2 that is commonly used in epidemiologic studies for
   deriving estimates of traffic-related air pollution. Here, we
   investigate the use of a transportation model developed during the
   summer season to generate a measure of traffic emissions as an
   alternative to the LUR model. Our traffic model provides estimates of
   emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the level of individual roads, as
   does the LUR model. Our main objective was to compare the distribution
   of the spatial estimates of NOx computed from our transportation model
   to the distribution obtained from the LUR model. A secondary objective
   was to compare estimates of risk using these two exposure estimates. We
   observed that the correlation (spearman) between our two measures of
   exposure (NO2 and NOx) ranged from less than 0.3 to more than 0.9 across
   Montreal neighborhoods. The most important factor affecting the
   ``agreement{''} between the two measures in a specific area was found to
   be the length of roads. Areas affected by a high level of
   traffic-related air pollution had a far better agreement between the two
   exposure measures. A comparison of odds ratios (ORs) obtained from NO2
   and NO used in two case-control studies of breast and prostate cancer,
   showed that the differences between the ORs associated with NO2 exposure
   vs NOx exposure differed by 5.2-8.8\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Montreal has significant seismic risk due to the combination of moderate
   seismicity, high population density, and vulnerable infrastructure. An
   important tool in damage and risk assessment is a scenario shakemap,
   which shows the expected ground shaking intensity distribution patterns.
   In this study, we use regional ground motion and site response
   evaluations to generate scenario shakemaps for Montreal. The impact of
   event location on expected ground motions and intensities was tested by
   considering the occurrence of a scenario (a given magnitude event) at
   various locations, where the scenarios are defined based on an analysis
   of the most likely future event locations. Variability in near surface
   geology plays an important role in earthquake ground shaking; we use
   microzonation information from Montreal to assess the expected site
   amplification effects. The results of this study may be used as input to
   seismic risk studies for Montreal.}},

Abstract = {{Chromobacterium violaceum is an opportunistic pathogen that causes
   infections that are difficult to treat. The goal of this research was to
   evaluate the effect of selected tannins (tannic acid (TA) and gallic
   acid (GA)) on bacterial growth, motility, antibiotic (carbenicillin,
   tetracycline) susceptibility, and biofilm formation. Both tannins,
   particularly TA, impaired bacterial growth levels and swimming
   motilities at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs). In
   combination with tannins, antibiotics showed increased MICs, suggesting
   that tannins interfered with antibacterial activity. Sub-MICs of
   tetracycline or TA alone enhanced biofilm formation of C. violaceum;
   however, in combination, these compounds inhibited biofilm formation. In
   contrast, carbenicillin at sub-MICs was effective in inhibiting C.
   violaceum biofilm formation; however, in combination with lower
   concentrations of TA or GA, biofilms were enhanced. These results
   provide insights into the effects of tannins on C. violaceum growth and
   their varying interaction with antibiotics used to target C. violaceum

Abstract = {{Recent advances in semiconductor technologies have given rise to the
   development of mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrometers that are compact,
   relatively inexpensive, robust and suitable for in situ proximal soil
   sensing. The objectives of this research were to evaluate a prototype
   portable mid-IR spectrometer for direct measurements of soil reflectance
   and to model the spectra to predict sand, clay and soil organic matter
   (SOM) contents under a range of field soil water conditions. Soil
   samples were collected from 23 locations at different depths in four
   agricultural fields to represent a range of soil textures, from sands to
   clay loams. The particle size distribution and SOM content of 48 soil
   samples were measured in the laboratory by conventional analytical
   methods. In addition to air-dry soil, each sample was wetted with two
   different amounts of water before the spectroscopic measurements were
   made. The prototype spectrometer was used to measure reflectance (R) in
   the range between 1811 and 898cm(-1) (approximately 5522 to 11136nm).
   The spectroscopic measurements were recorded randomly and in triplicate,
   resulting in a total of 432 reflectance spectra (48 samplesxthree soil
   water contentsxthree replicates). The spectra were transformed to
   log(10) (1/R) and mean centred for the multivariate statistical
   analyses. The 48 samples were split randomly into a calibration set
   (70\%) and a validation set (30\%). A partial least squares regression
   (PLSR) was used to develop spectroscopic calibrations to predict sand,
   clay and SOM contents. Results show that the portable spectrometer can
   be used with PLSR to predict clay and sand contents of either wet or dry
   soil samples with a root mean square error (RMSE) of around 10\%.
   Predictions of SOM content resulted in RMSE values that ranged between
   0.76 and 2.24\%.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the use of piecewise direct standardization (PDS) to
   remove the effects of water and other environmental factors from
   proximally sensed (field) visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) spectra. Our
   hypothesis was that the PDS-standardized field spectra can be used to
   predict soil carbon effectively with calibrations derived from existing
   spectroscopic databases of spectra recorded in the laboratory on dried,
   ground and sieved samples. In our experiments we used field spectra
   recorded in situ with a portable spectrometer at 124 sites in 11 paddy
   fields in Zhejiang Province, China. We sampled the soil at these same
   sites, recorded their spectra in the laboratory and measured their soil
   organic carbon (SOC) contents with a conventional laboratory technique.
   Two-thirds of the samples were used to relate the laboratory spectra to
   SOC by partial least squares regression (PLSR), and the remaining
   one-third was used as an independent validation dataset. We selected a
   representative set of samples from corresponding field and laboratory
   spectra that we could use as the PDS transfer set. Piecewise direct
   standardization was used to relate each wavelength in the laboratory
   spectra to the corresponding wavelength and its neighbours in the field
   spectra. The field spectra of the validation samples were then corrected
   with PDS so that they acquired the characteristics of the spectra
   measured under laboratory conditions. The approach was evaluated by (i)
   quantifying the similarity between the PDS-standardized spectra and
   their corresponding laboratory spectra, (ii) measuring the accuracy of
   their SOC predictions on the independent validation dataset and (iii)
   comparing these results with those of direct standardization (DS). Both
   PDS and DS led to considerable improvements in the predictions of SOC
   (R-2=0.71, R-2=0.60, respectively), compared with those with original
   field spectra (R-2=0.03). However, fewer transfer samples were needed
   with PDS to obtain similar results.}},

   spectra (k-nearest neighbours). The central idea of the local
   regression, and of other local statistical approaches, is to derive a
   local prediction model by identifying samples in the calibration dataset
   that are similar, in spectral variable space, to the samples used for
   prediction. Here, to derive our local regressions we used Euclidean
   distance in spectral space between the calibration dataset and
   prediction samples, and we also used soil geographical zoning to account
   for similarities in soil-forming conditions. We tested this approach
   with the CSSL, which comprised 2732 soil samples collected from 20
   provinces in the People's Republic of China to predict soil organic
   matter (SOM). Results showed that the prediction accuracy of our
   spatially constrained local-PLSR method (R-2=0.74, RPIQ=2.6) was better
   than that from local-PLSR (R-2=0.69, RPIQ=2.3) and PLSR alone (R-2=0.50,
   RPIQ=1.5). The coupling of a local-PLSR regression with soil
   geographical zoning can improve the accuracy of local SOM predictions
   using large, complex soil spectral libraries. The approach might be
   embedded into vis-NIR sensors for laboratory analysis or field
   estimation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel sigma-point unscented predictive filter
   (UPF) for relative position and attitude estimation of satellite
   formation taking into account the influence of J(2). A coupled relative
   translational dynamics model is formulated to represent orbital motion
   of arbitrary feature points on the deputy spacecraft, and the relative
   attitude motion is formulated by considering a rotational dynamics for a
   satellite without gyros. Based on the proposed coupled dynamic model,
   the UPF is developed based on unscented transformation technique,
   extending the capability of a traditional predictive filter (PF). The
   algorithm flow of the UPF is described first. Then it is demonstrated
   that the estimation accuracy of the model error and system state for UPF
   is higher than that of the traditional PF. In addition, the unscented
   Kalman filter (UKF) is also employed in order to compare the performance
   of the proposed UPF with that of the UKF. Several different scenarios
   are simulated to validate the effectiveness of the coupled dynamics
   model and the performance of the proposed UPF. Through comparisons, the
   proposed UPF is shown to yield highly accurate estimation of relative
   position and attitude during satellite formation flying. (C) 2015 IAA.

Abstract = {{Legionellosis is a very devastating disease worldwide mainly due to
   unpredictable outbreaks in man-made water systems. Developing a highly
   specific and sensitive rapid detection system that detects only
   metabolically active bacteria is a main priority for water quality
   assessment. We previously developed a versatile technique for sensitive
   and specific detection of synthetic RNA. In the present work, we further
   investigated the performance of the developed biosensor for detection of
   Legionella pneumophila in complex environmental samples, particularly
   those containing protozoa. The specificity and sensitivity of the
   detection system were verified using total RNA extracted from L.
   pneumophila in spiked water co-cultured with amoebae. We demonstrated
   that the expression level of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is extremely dependent
   on the environmental conditions. The presence of amoebae with L.
   pneumophila, especially in nutrition-deprived samples, increased the
   amount of L. pneumophila 15-fold after 1 week as measured through the
   expression of 16s rRNA. Using the developed surface plasmon resonance
   imaging (SPRi) detection method, we were also able to successfully
   detect L. pneumophila within 3 h, both in the presence and absence of
   amoebae in the complex environmental samples obtained from a cooling
   water tower. These findings suggest that the developed biosensing system
   is a viable method for rapid, real-time and effective detection not only
   for L. pneumophila in environmental samples but also to assess the risk
   associated with the use of water contaminated with other pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{Intestinal inflammation is one of the major factors that increase
   colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence worldwide. Inflammation in the
   gastrointestinal tract is directly linked to tumor development at the
   early stages of the disease, thus a key issue toward the prevention and
   the treatment of colonic neoplasia. Thus, the use of anti-inflammatory
   drugs has emerged first as a strategy to reduce chronic inflammation in
   case of many inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but it has proven its
   efficacy by reducing the risk of colonic neoplasia. This comprehensive
   review highlights the role of chronic inflammation, mainly in IBD, in
   the development of CRC including molecular and immune mechanisms that
   have tumorigenic effects. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that
   several bioactive and phytochemical compounds used as anti-inflammatory
   drugs have also antitumoral attributes. The uses of orally delivered
   cytokines and small molecules, as well as key dietary supplementation as
   anti-inflammatory therapeutics are discussed. In addition, comprehensive
   knowledge about CRC and intestinal inflammation, and the importance of
   the intestinal mucosal wall as a mucosal immunological barrier that
   comes into play during interactions with gut microbiota (pathogens and
   commensal), luminal secretions (bile acids, and bacterial and epithelial
   metabolites), and ingested chemicals (food components, high fat content,
   heterocyclic amines, and low intake of dietary fiber) are underscored.
   The multifunctionality of several anti-inflammatory drugs opens a line
   for their application in the treatment and prevention not only in IBD
   but also in CRC. Current bioengineering approaches for oral delivery of
   anti-inflammatory agents including cytokines, genetically modified
   bacteria, or small molecule inhibitors of inflammation directly
   contribute to the early management of CRC. Limitations of the current
   therapeutics, which stem from the lack of complete understanding of the
   complex molecular interactions between the intestinal microbiota,
   colonic epithelial barrier, and host immune system, are also discussed.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Remote communities are typically isolated from the main electricity grid
   and require local generation, most often relying on expensive resources
   (especially diesel) to supply their load. The economic and logistical
   aspects are such that there is value in exploring different approaches
   to reduce the consumption of diesel and to increase the energy input
   from local renewables. In this paper, we focus on using the virtual
   storage capabilities of the demand side to perform diesel generation
   optimization. Specifically, we revisit the economic dispatch (ED)
   problem by adapting it to the presence of flexible demand. We compare
   three different formulation approaches: 1) where demand is reallocated
   heuristically to shave the peak; 2) where the reallocation is itself
   optimized; and 3) that attempts to optimize the overall efficiency of
   the diesel units. A case study based upon a remote microgrid shows that
   flexible demand can decrease diesel fuel consumption in an economically
   meaningful manner, which is still significant given the costs associated
   with the purchase and haulage of diesel to these small communities.}},

Abstract = {{Modern power systems are undergoing a transitional phase, increasingly
   incorporating renewable energy sources (RES) to harness their economic
   and environmental benefits. The main challenge with this transitional
   phase is the management of the increased variability and uncertainty in
   the power balance. Legacy operation and planning practices are gradually
   seen as becoming inadequate or ill-adapted in addressing this challenge.
   One particular gap in the state of the art, which is of great
   importance, is estimating the operational flexibility potential of
   individual power system assets and their aggregation at the system
   level. System operators need to evaluate and plan ahead flexibility
   adequacy for their power systems in order to ensure feasible and
   economical operation under high RES penetration. Likewise, asset owners
   need to integrate the notion of asset flexibility as part of their
   investment and operations decisions. To this end, we propose the concept
   of the flexibility envelope to describe the flexibility potential
   dynamics of a power system and its individual resources in the
   operational planning time-frame. We demonstrate that the resulting
   envelope dynamics can be a starting point for flexibility adequacy
   planning in systems with highly variable generation.}},

Abstract = {{This work examines the temporal-spatial variations of daily automobile
   distance traveled and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and their
   association with built environment attributes and household
   socio-demographics. A GHGs household inventory is determined using
   link-level average speeds for a large and representative sample of
   households in three origin-destination surveys (1998, 2003 and 2008) in
   Montreal, Canada. For the emission inventories, different sources of
   data are combined including link-level average speeds in the network,
   vehicle occupancy levels and fuel consumption characteristics of the
   vehicle fleet. Urban form indicators over time such as population
   density, land use mix and transit accessibility are generated for each
   household in each of the three waves. A latent class (LC) regression
   modeling framework is then implemented to investigate the association of
   built environment and socio-demographics with GHGs and automobile
   distance traveled. Among other results, it is found that population
   density, transit accessibility and land-use mix have small but
   statistically significant negative impact on GHGs and car usage. Despite
   that this is in accordance with past studies, the estimated elasticities
   are greater than those reported in the literature for North American
   cities. Moreover, different household subpopulations are identified in
   which the effect of built environment varies significantly. Also, a
   reduction of the average GHGs at the household level is observed over
   time. According to our estimates, households produced 15\% and 10\% more
   GHGs in 1998 and 2003 respectively, compared to 2008. This reduction can
   be associated to the improvement of the fuel economy of vehicle fleet
   and the decrease of motor-vehicle usage - e.g., a decrease of 4\% is
   observed for fuel efficiency rates and 12\% for distance according to
   the raw average estimates from 1998 with respect to 2008. A strong link
   is also observed between socio-demographics and the two travel outcomes.
   While number of workers is positively associated with car distance and
   GHGs, low and medium income households pollute less than high-income
   households. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pedestrians and cyclists are amongst the most vulnerable road users.
   Pedestrian and cyclist collisions involving motor-vehicles result in
   high injury and fatality rates for these two modes. Data for pedestrian
   and cyclist activity at intersections such as volumes, speeds, and
   space-time trajectories are essential in the field of transportation in
   general, and road safety in particular. However, automated data
   collection for these two road user types remains a challenge. Due to the
   constant change of orientation and appearance of pedestrians and
   cyclists, detecting and tracking them using video sensors is a difficult
   task. This is perhaps one of the main reasons why automated data
   collection methods are more advanced for motorized traffic. This paper
   presents a method based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients to extract
   features of an image box containing the tracked object and Support
   Vector Machine to classify moving objects in crowded traffic scenes.
   Moving objects are classified into three categories: pedestrians,
   cyclists, and motor vehicles. The proposed methodology is composed of
   three steps: (i) detecting and tracking each moving object in video
   data, (ii) classifying each object according to its appearance in each
   frame, and (iii) computing the probability of belonging to each class
   based on both object appearance and speed. For the last step, Bayes'
   rule is used to fuse appearance and speed in order to predict the object
   class. Using video datasets collected in different intersections, the
   methodology was built and tested. The developed methodology achieved an
   overall classification accuracy of greater than 88\%. However, the
   classification accuracy varies across modes and is highest for vehicles
   and lower for pedestrians and cyclists. The applicability of the
   proposed methodology is illustrated using a simple case study to analyze
   cyclist-vehicle conflicts at intersections with and without bicycle
   facilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lifelong bilingualism is associated with the delayed diagnosis of
   dementia, suggesting bilingual experience is relevant to brain health in
   aging. While the effects of bilingualism on cognitive functions across
   the lifespan are well documented, less is known about the neural
   substrates underlying differential behaviour. It is clear that
   bilingualism affects brain regions that mediate language abilities and
   that these regions are at least partially overlapping with those that
   exhibit age-related decline. Moreover, the behavioural advantages
   observed in bilingualism are generally found in executive function
   performance, suggesting that the frontal lobes may also be sensitive to
   bilingualism, which exhibit volume reductions with age. The current
   study investigated structural differences in the brain of lifelong
   bilingual older adults (n=14, mean age=70.4) compared with older
   monolinguals (n=14, mean age=70.6). We employed two analytic approaches:
   1) we examined global differences in grey and white matter volumes; and,
   2) we examined local differences in volume and cortical thickness of
   specific regions of interest previously implicated in
   bilingual/monolingual comparisons (temporal pole) or in aging
   (entorhinal cortex and hippocampus). We expected bilinguals would
   exhibit greater volume of the frontal lobe and temporal lobe (grey and
   white matter), given the importance of these regions in executive and
   language functions, respectively. We further hypothesized that regions
   in the medial temporal lobe, which demonstrate early changes in aging
   and exhibit neural pathology in dementia, would be more preserved in the
   bilingual group. As predicted, bilinguals exhibit greater frontal lobe
   white matter compared with monolinguals. Moreover, increasing age was
   related to decreasing temporal pole cortical thickness in the
   monolingual group, but no such relationship was observed for bilinguals.
   Finally, Stoop task performance was positively correlated with frontal
   lobe white matter, emphasizing the importance of preserved white matter
   in maintaining executive function in aging. These results underscore
   previous findings implicating an association between bilingualism and
   preserved frontal and temporal lobe function in aging.

Abstract = {{Security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) and security-constrained
   unit commitment (SCUC) problems are necessary tools to system operators
   for operational planning and near-to-real-time operation. The solution
   times of these problems are challenging mainly due to their inherent
   large size. Previous studies have shown that relatively few of those
   problems' constraints serve to enclose their feasible set of solutions.
   Therefore, the constraints that do not contribute to the feasible set of
   solutions could be discarded to decrease the size of these problems and
   their associated solution times. Umbrella constraint discovery (UCD) has
   been proposed to identify and rule out redundant constraints in dc-SCOPF
   problems. In this paper, we propose an improvement over the original UCD
   formulation that exploits the structure of its parent SCOPF problem.
   This new partial UCD approach can lead to significant speed-ups in terms
   of UCD solution time and size. Based on the encouraging results for
   partial UCD on SCOPF, we apply the technique on SCUC. Alike in SCOPF,
   partial UCD can efficiently strip out redundant (i. e., non-umbrella)
   constraints off SCUC. We find, however, that because of its structure,
   SCUC has a much lower proportion of non-umbrella constraints in
   comparison to SCOPF.}},

Abstract = {{Many space vehicles have been launched with large flexible components
   such as booms and solar arrays. These large space structures may require
   active shape control given the possibility of lightly damped vibrations.
   Such vibrations can be controlled using a collection of control moment
   gyros, which consist of a spinning wheel in gimbals and produce a torque
   when the orientation of the wheel is changed. This study investigates
   the optimal distribution of these control moment gyros on large space
   structures for vibration suppression. Initially, a continuum model is
   adopted that represents the distribution of control moment gyros by a
   continuous distribution of stored angular momentum (gyricity). The
   optimal control solution for the gimbal motions (for a given gyricity
   distribution) is then optimized with respect to the gyricity
   distribution. Further investigation considers discrete parameter models
   of beam and a plate structures with evenly placed discrete pointwise
   control moment gyros. Numerical optimization of a suitable cost function
   allocates the amount of stored angular momentum possessed by these
   control moment gyros.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for fiberboards has been growing in recent years. However,
   emission of formaldehyde, which was the main component of adhesives in
   fiberboards, has caused environmental and health concerns. Industries
   are therefore pursuing green chemistry technologies to eliminate these

   the manufacturing process involved no resin addition. Several potential
   mechanisms of the formation of binderless fiberboards have been
   proposed. Chemical changes of components in lignocellulosic materials
   were expected to occur, and self-bonding achieved during hot pressing
   provided main bonding strength. This review summarized various aspects
   of binderless fiberboard production, particularly feasibility of
   different raw materials, chemical and enzymatic pretreatments of raw
   materials, manufacturing process, as well as the potential mechanism of
   self-bonding. Furthermore, further work that may benefit the elucidation

Abstract = {{The transport of reactive solutes can be influenced by transport-related
   and sorption-related nonequilibrium processes. The reactive contaminant
   transport model for fracture and the multiprocess nonequilibrium (MPNE)
   model for porous formation is considered. Two coupled transport
   equations, one for the porous formation and the other for the fracture,
   were solved numerically using a hybrid finite-volume method. The
   numerical model employs a globally second-order accurate explicit
   finite-volume method for the advective transport and a finite-difference
   method for the dispersive transport and coupled reaction terms. An
   attempt is made to investigate the effects of various MPNE model
   parameters on the concentration profile in the fracture. It was found
   that the higher values of mass transfer coefficient, sorption
   coefficient, matrix diffusion coefficient, fracture retardation
   coefficient, and matrix porosity in the advective and nonadvective
   regions of the porous matrix leads to a decrease in the solute
   concentration in the fracture. This numerical model might be useful in
   simulating the reactive transport through fractured porous media at

   functioned in retting process was studied. It was found that RF best
   improved retting quality of the 2-day, and 6- and 10-day water retting
   at 40 degrees C and 90 degrees C for 60 min, respectively. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{When interacting with a virtual object (VO) through a haptic device, it
   is crucial to feedback a contact force to the human operator (HO) that
   displays the VO physical properties with high fidelity. The core
   challenge, here, is to expand the renderable range of these properties,
   including larger stiffness and smaller inertia, at the available
   sampling rate. To address this challenge, a framework entitled
   high-fidelity contact rendering (HFCR) has been developed in this paper.
   The framework consists of three main strategies: an energy-based
   rendering of the contact force, smooth transition (ST) between contact
   modes, and remaining leak dissipation (LD). The essence of these
   strategies is to make the VO emulate its continuous-time counterpart.
   This is achieved via physically meaningful modifications in the
   constitutive relations to suppress artificial energy leaks. The
   strategies are first developed for the one-dimensional (1D) canonical
   VO; then, generalization to the multivariable case is discussed.
   Renderability has been analyzed exploring different stability criteria
   within a unified approach. This leads to stability charts and
   identification of renderable range of properties in the presence and
   absence of the HO. The framework has been validated through simulation
   and various experiments. Results verify its promising aspects for
   various scenarios including sustained contact and sudden collision
   events with or without the HO.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{144-153}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Direct injection of reactive nanoscale zerovalent iron particles (NZVI)
   is considered to be a promising approach for remediation of aquifers
   contaminated by chlorinated organic pollutants. In this study we show
   that the extent of sulfidation of NZVI enhances the rate of
   dechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE) compared to that by unamended
   NZVI, and the enhancement depends on the Fe/S molar ratio. Experiments
   where TCE was reacted with NZVI sulfidated to different extents (Fe/S
   molar ratios 0.62-66) showed that the surface-area normalized
   first-order TCE degradation rate constant increased up to 40 folds
   compared to non-sulfidated NZVI. Fe/S ratios in the range of 12-25
   provided the highest TCE dechlorination rates, and rates decreased at
   both higher and lower Fe/S. In contrast, sulfidated NZVI exposed to
   water in the absence of TCE showed significantly lower hydrogen
   evolution rate (2.75 mu mol L-1 h(-1)) compared to that by an unamended
   NZVI (6.92 mu mol L-1 h(-1)), indicating that sulfidation of NZVI
   suppressed corrosion reactions with water. Sulfide (HS-) ions reacted
   rapidly with NZVI and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses showed
   formation of a surface layer of FeS and FeS2. We propose that more
   electrons are preferentially conducted from sulfidated NZVI than from
   unamended NZVI to TCE, likely because of greater binding of TCE on the
   reactive sites of the iron sulfide outer layer. Resuspending sulfidated
   NZVI in sulfide-free or sulfide containing solutions altered the TCE
   degradation rate constants because of changes in the FeS layer
   thickness. Sulfidated NZVI maintained its high reactivity in the
   presence of multiple mono and divalent ions and with polyelectrolyte
   coatings. Thus, sulfide ions in groundwater can significantly alter NZVI
   reactivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Global occurrence of anti-infectives in contaminated surface waters:
   Impact of income inequality between countries}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{89-97}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The presence anti-infectives in environmental waters is of interest
   because of their potential role in the dissemination of anti-infective
   resistance in bacteria and other harmful effects on non-target species
   such as algae and shellfish. Since no information on global trends
   regarding the contamination caused by these bioactive substances is yet
   available, we decided to investigate the impact of income inequality
   between countries on the occurrence of anti-infectives in surface
   waters. In order to perform such study, we gathered concentration values
   reported in the peer-reviewed literature between 1998 and 2014 and built
   a database. To fill the gap of knowledge on occurrence of
   anti-infectives in African countries, we also collected 61 surface water
   samples from Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique and South Africa, and measured
   concentrations of 19 anti-infectives. A mixed one-way analysis of
   covariance (ANCOVA) model, followed by Turkey-Kramer post hoc tests was
   used to identify potential differences in anti-infective occurrence
   between countries grouped by income level (high, upper-middle and
   lower-middle and low income) according to the classification by the
   World Bank. Comparison of occurrence of anti-infectives according to
   income level revealed that concentrations of these substances in
   contaminated surface waters were significantly higher in low and
   lower-middle income countries (p = 0.0001) but not in upper-middle
   income countries (p = 0.0515) compared to high-income countries. We
   explained these results as the consequence of the absence of or limited
   sewage treatment performed in lower income countries. Furthermore,
   comparison of concentrations of low cost anti-infectives (sulfonamides
   and trimethoprim) and the more expensive macrolides between income
   groups suggest that the cost of these substances may have an impact on
   their environmental occurrence in lower income countries. Since
   wastewaters are the most important source of contamination of
   anti-infectives and other contaminants of emerging concern in the
   environment, it is expected that deleterious effects to the aquatic
   biota caused by these substances will be more pronounced in countries
   with inadequate wastewater and collection infrastructure. With the
   information currently available, we could not evaluate either the role
   of the receiving environment or the importance of regulatory frameworks
   on the occurrence of anti-infectives in surface waters. Future studies
   should focus on these two factors in order to better evaluate risks to
   aquatic ecosystems in LM\&LICs. We propose that CECs such as
   anti-infectives could be used as a new class of environmental
   degradation indicators that could be helpful to assess the state of
   development of wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure around
   the world. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   layers: Effect of through-plane saturation distribution}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{319-333}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The effective diffusivity of gaseous species in partially-saturated
   finite-size porous media is a valuable parameter for mathematical
   modeling of many processes, but it is difficult to measure
   experimentally. In this work, the effective diffusivity of carbon-fiber
   gas diffusion layers (GDLs) used in polymer electrolyte fuel cells
   (PEFCs) was determined by performing lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations
   on X-ray tomographic reconstructions of invading water configurations.
   Calculations on dry GDLs were in close agreement with previous
   experimental data; the effective diffusivity was reduced by the addition
   of PTFE due to the loss of pore volume and the higher tortuosity of
   transport paths. The effect of water saturation was significantly
   larger. It was found that the resistance of water to gas transport was
   extremely dependent on the saturation distribution through the porous
   medium, particularly the peak saturation, and not just the average
   saturation as is typically considered in the literature. Through-plane
   diffusion was dramatically limited in materials with high-peak local
   saturations, even at low average saturation levels. No significant
   limitations were observed for diffusion in the material plane. The
   computed results demonstrate the strong sensitivity of finite-size
   porous media to local conditions, highlighting the difficulties of
   applying volume-averaged continuum-scale modeling techniques to
   micro-scale materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A crystallographic orientation contrast in the form of cross-shaped and
   intersecting contours was observed in a backscattered electron (BSE)
   micrograph of deformed magnesium (Mg) grains in a cold field emission
   scanning electron microscope (CFE-SEM). This contrast was identified as
   rotation contour contrast (RCC). A model is presented to link the RCC in
   the BSE micrograph to the channeling contrast in the corresponding
   channeling pattern. Based on this model, the appearance of the
   cross-shaped RCC in the BSE micrograph was attributed to the rotation of
   the crystal about two rotation axes and the RCC was related to a two
   dimensional angular scan of the corresponding channeling pattern. This
   model was experimentally validated using the selected are a channeling
   pattern (SACP) technique. The crystallographic directions of the

Abstract = {{Adsorption by carbonaceous sorbents is among the most feasible processes
   to remove perfluorooctane sulfonic (PFOS) and carboxylic acids (PFOA)
   from drinking and ground waters. However, carbon surface chemistry,
   which has long been recognized essential for dictating performance of
   such sorbents, has never been considered for PFOS and PFOA adsorption.
   Thus, the role of surface chemistry was systematically investigated
   using sorbents with a wide range in precursor material, pore structure,
   and surface chemistry. Sorbent surface chemistry overwhelmed physical
   properties in controlling the extent of uptake. The adsorption affinity
   was positively correlated carbon surface basicity, suggesting that high
   acid neutralizing or anion exchange capacity was critical for
   substantial uptake of PFOS and PFOA. Carbon polarity or hydrophobicity
   had insignificant impact on the extent of adsorption. Synthetic
   polymer-based Ambersorb and activated carbon fibers were more effective
   than activated carbon made of natural materials in removing PFOS and

Abstract = {{This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis to determine
   the nonlinear hydrostatic restoring loads and stiffnesses of a floating

   hydrostatic restoring moments for general fully coupled 3D displacements
   are derived. Exact expressions for the coupled water plane area
   restoring moments in pitch, roll, and yaw are derived in the body and
   inertial frames. The analysis is subsequently used to evaluate the
   hydrostatic loads and stiffness of floating cylinders that undergo large
   displacement, such as floating wind turbine (FWT) platforms. Moreover,
   it can be used to determine the equilibrium positions and orientation of

Abstract = {{A study is conducted with the aim of developing and implementing a

   independent experiments on composite components using digital image

Abstract = {{Introducing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into a polymer matrix can
   significantly improve the mechanical properties of nanocomposites.
   However regarding current processing techniques, there are several
   factors influencing the effective properties of carbon nanotube
   reinforced composites. Among these important factors, the interface,
   waviness, agglomeration, orientation and length of the nanotube are key
   parameters affecting the mechanical properties of nanocomposites. The
   effects of carbon nanotube length, waviness, agglomeration and
   distribution on the vibration behavior of functionally graded
   nanocomposite beams reinforced by single-walled carbon nanotubes
   (SWCNTs) are investigated in the present study. Monte-Carlo simulation
   is used to determine the effective elastic properties of wavy CNTs and a
   two-scale micromechanical model is developed to calculate the elastic
   properties of nanocomposites. The large scale model includes the
   CNT-free matrix and the clustered CNT/matrix inclusions. The small scale
   model addresses the property of the clustered inclusions containing the
   randomly oriented, transversely isotropic CNTs and matrix. Timoshenko
   beam theory is adopted to derive the governing equations and the finite
   element method is employed to discretize the model and obtain the
   numerical solution. The results show that the above mentioned parameters
   of nanotubes have significant effects on the vibrational behavior of
   functionally graded nanocomposite beams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{The role of the rotation matrix in the teaching of planar kinematics}},
Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{28-37}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A prevalent tool in the teaching of planar kinematics is Euler's
   formula, namely, e(j theta) = cos theta + jsin theta, with j defined as
   j(2) = -1, regarded as an operator in the complex-number plane. This
   operator maps every complex number z = x + jy into xcos theta - ysin
   theta + j(xsin theta + ycos theta). When z is represented as a vector in
   the complex plane, e(j theta)z is z rotated through an angle theta ccw.
   This works and helps derive expressions for the position, velocity, and
   acceleration of a point of a rigid body in a systematic way. The
   downside of this practice is twofold: (i) it hides the geometrical
   meaning of the rotation; and (ii) it prevents the generalization of the
   operator to three dimensions. As an alternative to the use of Euler's
   formula, the 2 x 2 rotation matrix is available, but its use is not
   common in textbooks. The purpose of this paper is to stress the benefits
   of the use of this matrix in two dimensions, its straightforward
   generalization to three dimensions, and a possible extension to higher
   dimensions, if the need arises. An example of the use of the rotation
   matrix in planar kinematics is included, by means of an example taken
   from an application in mobile robotics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Multisensor video fusion based on higher order singular value
   decomposition}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION FUSION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{54-71}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{With the ongoing development of sensor technologies, more and more kinds
   of video sensors are being employed in video surveillance systems to
   improve robustness and monitoring performance. In addition, there is
   often a strong motivation to simultaneously observe the same scene by
   more than one kind of sensor. How to sufficiently and effectively
   utilize the information captured by these different sensors is thus of
   considerable interest. This can be realized using video fusion, by which
   multiple aligned videos from different sensors are merged into a
   composite.
   In this paper, a video fusion algorithm is presented based on the 3D
   Surfacelet Transform (3D-ST) and the higher order singular value
   decomposition (HOSVD). In the proposed method, input videos are first
   decomposed into many subbands using the 3D-ST. Then the relevant
   subbands from all of the input videos are merged to obtain the
   corresponding subbands of the intended fused video. Finally, the fused
   video is constructed by performing the inverse 3D-ST on the merged
   subband coefficients. Typically, the spatial information in the scene
   backgrounds and the temporal information related to moving objects are
   mixed together in each subband. In the proposed fusion method, the
   spatial and temporal information are actually first separated from each
   other and then merged using the HOSVD. This is different from the
   currently published fusion rules (e.g., spatio-temporal energy
   ``maximum{''} or ``matching{''}), which are usually just simple
   extensions of static image fusion rules. In these, the spatial and
   temporal information contained in the input videos are generally treated
   equally and merged by the same fusion strategy. In addition, we note
   that the so-called ``scene noise{''} in an input video has been largely
   ignored by the current literature. We show that this noise can be
   distinguished from the spatio-temporal objects of interest in the scene
   and then suppressed using the HOSVD. Clearly, this would be very
   advantageous for a surveillance system, particularly one dealing with
   scenes of crowds.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fusion method
   exhibits a lower computational complexity than some existing published
   video fusion methods, such as the ones based on the structure tensor and
   the pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN). When the videos are noisy, a
   modified version of the proposed method is shown to perform better than
   specialized methods based on the Bivariate-Laplacian model and the PCNN.

Abstract = {{An alternative analysis technique for the quantitation of 15 poly-and
   perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in water matrices is reported.
   Analysis time between each sample was reduced to less than 20 s, all
   target molecules being analyzed in a single run with the use of laser
   diode thermal desorption atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
   (LDTD/APCI) coupled with high resolution accurate mass (HRMS) orbitrap
   mass spectrometry. LDTD optimal settings were investigated using either
   one-factor-at-a-time or experimental design methodologies, while
   orbitrap parameters were optimized simultaneously by means of a
   Box-Behnken design. Following selection of an adequate sample
   concentration and purification procedure based on solid-phase extraction
   and graphite clean-up, the method was validated in an influent
   wastewater matrix. Environmentally significant limits of detection were
   reported (0.3-4 ng L-1 in wastewater and 0.03-0.2 ng L-1 in surface
   water) and out of the 15 target analytes, 11 showed excellent accuracies
   (+/- 20\% of the target values) and recovery rates (75-125\%). The
   method was successfully applied to a selection of environmental samples,
   including wastewater samples in 7 locations across Canada, as well as
   surface and tap water samples from the Montreal region, providing
   insights into the degree of PFAS contamination in this area. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Recent advances in digital technologies, such as high-speed computers
   and large-format digital imagers, have led to a burgeoning interest in
   the science and engineering of digital holographic microscopy (DHM).
   Here we report on a novel off-axis DHM, based on a twin-beam optical
   design, which avoids the limitations of prior systems, and provides many
   advantages, including compactness, intrinsic stability, robustness
   against misalignment, ease of use, and cost. These advantages are traded
   for a physically constrained sample volume, as well as a fixed fringe
   spacing. The first trade is not overly restrictive for most
   applications, and the latter provides for a pre-set assembly alignment
   that optimizes the spatial frequency sampling. Moreover, our new design
   supports use in both routine laboratory settings as well as extreme
   environments without any sacrifice in performance, enabling ready
   observation of microbial species in the field. The instrument design is
   presented in detail here, along with a demonstration of bacterial video
   imaging at sub-micrometer resolution at temperatures down to -15 degrees

Title = {{Upsampling method for sparse light detection and ranging using
   coregistered panoramic images}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{We present a method to upsample low-resolution light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR) data using coregistered panoramic images collected in
   urban environments. The context is a mobile mapping vehicle equipped
   with a LiDAR scanner and spherical camera system, where the goal is to
   recover a three-dimensional model of the built environment. What makes
   this problem challenging is that as LiDAR samples become sparse,
   interpolation becomes difficult as connectivity between points can
   become ambiguous. The idea behind this paper is to use structural
   context and information in the associated panoramic images to determine
   the location of surfaces in the scene, and by inference, the surface
   membership of the LiDAR samples. With the latter determined, surfaces
   can then be reconstructed via interpolation using a function appropriate
   to the task at hand. We show that this method is effective in recovering
   details that are not apparent in the initial dataset. In the event that
   images are either uninformative or not available, we introduce a
   fallback method for surface segmentation that infers depth
   discontinuities from the properties of the surface triangulation.
   Experimental results are presented showing the performance of both
   methods on data acquired from an urban setting. (C) 2015 Society of

Abstract = {{Solar energy harvesting and hydrogen economy am the two most important
   green energy endeavors for the future. However, a critical hurdle to the

   we developed a reversible hydrogen storage system based on low-cost
   liquid organic cyclic hydrocarbons at room temperature and atmospheric
   pressure. A facile switch of hydrogen addition (>97\% conversion) and
   release (>99\% conversion) With superior capacity of 7.1 H-2 wt \% can
   be quickly achieved over a rationally optimized platinum catalyst with
   high electron density, simply regulated by dark/light conditions.
   Furthermore, the photodriven dehydrogenation of cyclic alkanes gave an
   excellent apparent quantum efficiency of 6.0\% under visible light
   illumination (420-600 nm) without any other energy input, which provides
   an alternative route to artificial photosynthesis for directly

Title = {{The effect of simvastatin treatment on endothelial cell response to
   shear stress and tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulation}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Statin drugs are one of the most commonly prescribed
   pharmaceuticals by physicians. By blocking the rate-limiting step in the
   cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis,
   which benefits patient health. However, since many other important
   cellular processes are regulated within this pathway, they may also be
   influenced by statin therapy. These pleiotropic effects of statins have
   not been fully investigated, but are believed to positively influence
   endothelial cells (ECs), which line the vasculature in a confluent
   monolayer. Few studies have considered the effect of blood flow on ECs
   and how this may augment EC response to statins.
   Methods: In this study, the effect of statin treatment on ECs is
   investigated for cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor alpha
   (TNF-alpha), an inflammatory cytokine that promotes an atheroprone
   endothelium. Additionally, ECs are exposed to a physiologically relevant
   wall shear stress (WSS) of 12.5 dynes/cm(2) using a three-dimensional
   tissue culture model to provide a realistic hemodynamic environment. ECs
   are analyzed for morphology using light microscopy as well as
   cytoskeletal structure and alignment using confocal microscopy.
   Statistical analysis is performed on the results using both the one-way
   analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-tests and the two-tailed t
   test.
   Results: We have shown that statin treatment caused cells to adapt to a
   rounded, atheroprone morphology, with a significantly higher shape
   index. Oppositely, TNF-alpha stimulation caused cells to elongate to an
   atheroprotective morphology, with a significantly lower shape index. WSS
   and TNF-alpha were unable to reverse any statin-induced cell rounding or
   F-actin disruption.
   Conclusion: Further work is therefore needed to determine why statin
   drugs cause cells to have an atheroprone morphology, but an
   atheroprotective genotype, and why TNF-alpha stimulation causes an
   atheroprotective morphology, but an atheroprone genotype. Despite the
   morphological changes due to statins or stimulation, ECs still respond
   to WSS. Understanding how statins influence ECs will allow for more
   targeted treatments for hypercholestemia and potentially other diseases.}},

Title = {{Berry phase in cuprate superconductors}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{The geometrical Berry phase is widely recognized as having profound
   implications for the properties of electronic systems. Over the last
   decade or so, the Berry phase has been essential to our understanding of
   new materials such as graphene and topological insulators. In general, a
   nontrivial Berry phase is a result of band crossing as in the case of a
   massless Dirac point. The Berry phase can be accessed in quantum
   oscillation measurements as it contributes to the phase mismatch of
   electrons in their cyclotron orbits. With their enigmatic pseudogap and
   superconducting phases, the cuprates are materials where the Berry phase
   is thus far unknown. Based on quantum oscillation data in the high-field
   normal state of underdoped cuprates, we determined the Berry phase
   contribution to the phase mismatch unambiguously in this family of
   materials. In the hole-doped materials YBa2Cu3Oy, YBa2Cu4O8, and
   HgBa2CuO4+delta, a trivial Berry phase of 0 mod(2 pi) is systematically
   observed, while the electron-doped Nd2-xCexCuO4 exhibits a significant
   nonzero Berry phase of 1.4 pi. Our results set significant constraints
   on the microscopic description of the high-field normal state and, in
   particular, do not support a nodal structure or broken time-reversal
   symmetry in the hole-doped compounds.}},

Title = {{Dependence of capillary forces on relative humidity and the surface
   properties of femtosecond laser micromachined titanium}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{448}},
Pages = {{356-366}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Capillary forces were measured with colloidal atomic force microscopy at
   different levels of relative humidity on femtosecond laser micromachined
   titanium surfaces. After laser machining at different intensity levels,
   the titanium surfaces show a nanoscale ripple topology or microscopic
   bumpy structures. Different machining environments were chosen to
   influence the surface chemistry in addition to topology: while machining
   in pure oxygen and water resulted in surfaces consisting of TiO2, a
   composite surface of TiO2 and TiN was obtained after machining in pure
   nitrogen. All samples were subsequently exposed to pure oxygen, carbon
   dioxide or water, and showed different levels of wettability and
   capillary force. We have introduced the concept of humidity sensitivity
   as the relative increase of the capillary force with respect to the
   measured force at 0\% humidity. We report that samples with a nanoscale
   ripple topology machined in pure oxygen exhibit the lowest level of
   capillary force and the lowest sensitivity towards humidity in the
   environment. Surfaces with low sensitivity towards changes of the
   relative humidity are good candidates for technical applications, where
   capillary forces have to be controlled. This study contributes to the
   development of such surfaces, to a better understanding of how capillary
   bridges are formed on rough surfaces and ultimately to the exploration
   of the relationship between surface wettability and capillary forces.

Abstract = {{During rest, brain activity is synchronized between different regions
   widely distributed throughout the brain, forming functional networks.
   However, the molecular mechanisms supporting functional connectivity
   remain undefined. We show that functional brain networks defined with
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can be recapitulated
   by using measures of correlated gene expression in a post mortem brain
   tissue data set. The set of 136 genes we identify is significantly
   enriched for ion channels. Polymorphisms in this set of genes
   significantly affect resting-state functional connectivity in a large
   sample of healthy adolescents. Expression levels of these genes are also
   significantly associated with axonal connectivity in the mouse. The
   results provide convergent, multimodal evidence that resting-state
   functional networks correlate with the orchestrated activity of dozens
   of genes linked to ion channel activity and synaptic function.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium AZ31 alloy sheets were rolled at a high (1000 m/min) and a low
   (15 m/min) rolling speed. The microstructure and texture evolution were
   tracked using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD)
   techniques. At 100 degrees C, a total reduction of 72\% was achieved in
   one pass at the high rolling speed, while the sheet fractured at a
   reduction of only 37\% during low speed rolling. In the former case,
   dynamic recrystallization was observed to be well under way at a
   reduction of 49\% and full recrystallization was achieved at a reduction
   of 72\%. For a given reduction, the maximum intensity of the basal
   texture is weaker after high speed rolling than after low speed rolling.
   The far better rollability achieved during high speed rolling is
   attributed to the activation of < c+a > slip and dynamic
   recrystallization at the higher temperatures developed; the weaker
   texture is due to the activation of a larger number of twinning and slip
   systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In earlier work, we reported that spray freeze drying of cellulose
   nanocrystals (CNC) yields porous agglomerate structures. On the other
   hand, the conventional spray dried CNC (CNCSD) and the freeze dried CNC
   (CNCFD) produce compact solid structures with very low porosity. As it
   is rather difficult to obtain direct microscopic evidence of the quality
   of dispersion of CNC in polymer nanocomposites, it was shown that
   supporting evidence of the quality and influence of dispersion in a
   polypropylene (PP)/CNC nanocomposite could be obtained by studying the
   rheological behavior, mechanical properties and crystallization
   characteristics of PP/CNC nanocomposites. In an effort to produce a
   sustainable, fully biosourced, biodegradable nanocomposite, this
   manuscript presents the results of a study of the rheological,
   mechanical and crystallization behavior of PLA/CNCSFD nanocomposites
   obtained by melt processing. The results are analyzed to determine CNC
   network formation, rheological percolation threshold concentrations,
   mechanical properties in the rubbery and glassy states, and the effect
   of CNCSFD on crystalline nucleation and crystallization rates of PLA.
   These results suggest that the porosity and network structure of CNCSFD
   agglomerates contribute significantly to good dispersion of CNC in the
   PLA matrix. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) in water make entangled networks and stiff
   gels, which have a number of promising applications. In this work, the
   rheology of semi-dilute TEMPO-mediated oxidized CNF hydrogels, and the
   effects of cationic polyacrylamide and calcium ions on their
   viscoelastic properties are investigated. The elastic modulus varies
   with CNF volume fraction with a power law exponent of 4.52.
   Creep-recovery results show that suspensions with higher mass fractions
   exert a higher resistance against deformation, and a higher degree of
   recovery. Low ionic strengths and polyelectrolyte concentrations
   increase the creep deformation because of screening the surface charge.
   Higher ionic strengths and polyelectrolyte concentrations lead to fibril
   aggregation, which stiffens the network structure, decreasing the creep
   deformation. However, the recovery response is not significantly
   affected by additives. The critical strain at the onset of non-linear
   viscoelasticity is independent of mass fraction in two different
   concentration regimes, with a transition at 0.35\% w/w CNF. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Removal of heavy metal ions such as copper using an efficient and
   low-cost method with low ecological footprint is a critical process in
   wastewater treatment, which can be achieved in a liquid phase using
   nanoadsorbents such as inorganic nanoparticles. Recently, attention has
   turned toward developing sustainable and environmentally friendly
   nanoadsorbents to remove heavy metal ions from aqueous media.
   Electrosterically stabilized nanocrystalline cellulose (ENCC), which can
   be prepared from wood fibers through periodate/chlorite oxidation, has
   been shown to have a high charge content and colloidal stability. Here,
   we show that ENCC scavenges copper ions by different mechanisms
   depending on the ion concentration. When the Cu(II) concentration is low
   (C-0 less than or similar to 200 ppm), agglomerates of starlike ENCC
   particles appear, which are broken into individual starlike entities by
   shear and Brownian motion, as evidenced by photometric dispersion
   analysis, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron
   microscopy. On the other hand, at higher copper concentrations, the
   aggregate morphology changes from starlike to raftlike, which is
   probably due to the collapse of protruding dicarboxylic cellulose (DCC)
   chains and ENCC charge neutralization by copper adsorption. Such
   raftlike structures result from head-to-head and lateral aggregation of
   neutralized ENCCs as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. As
   opposed to starlike aggregates, the raftlike structures grow gradually
   and are prone to sedimentation at copper concentrations C-0 greater than
   or similar to 500 ppm, which eliminates a costly separation step in
   wastewater treatment processes. Moreover, a copper removal capacity of
   similar to 185 mg g(-1) was achieved thanks to the highly charged DCC
   polyanions protruding from ENCC. These properties along with the
   biorenewability make ENCC a promising candidate for wastewater
   treatment, in which fast, facile, and low-cost removal of heavy metal
   ions is desired most.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a driver behavior analysis using microscopic video

   of adverse winter weather conditions on highway driving behavior based
   on automated (computer) and manual methods. The research was conducted
   through two case studies. The first case study was conducted to evaluate
   the feasibility of applying an automated approach to extracting driver
   behavior data based on 15 video recordings obtained in the winter 2013
   at three different locations on the Don Valley Parkway in Toronto,
   Canada. A comparison was made between the automated approach and manual
   approach, and issues in collecting data using the automated approach
   under winter conditions were identified. The second case study was based
   on high quality data collected in the winter 2014, at a location on
   Highway 25 in Montreal, Canada. The results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the automated analytical framework in analyzing driver
   behavior, as well as evaluating the impact of adverse winter weather
   conditions on driver behavior. This approach could be applied to
   evaluate winter maintenance strategies and crash risk on highways during

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{The oil palm tree is an ancient tropical plant that originated from West
   Africa. Palm oil has centuries long use as food and medicine. This
   review covers the recent significant materials found in the literature
   on palm oil processing, refining, and use in frying especially in blends
   with other vegetable oils. Crude palm oil (CPO) is obtained from the
   fruit of the oil palm tree (Elaeis guineensis). The oil is rich in
   palmitic acid, p-carotene and vitamin E. CPO has been fractionated
   mainly into liquid palm olein and solid palm stearin in order to
   diversify its food applications. Palm oil is highly stable during frying
   especially due to the synergistic activity of 3-carotene and
   tocotrienol. In recent years there has been a shift from the use of
   animal fats and hydrogenated vegetable oils in frying and other food
   applications. The use of naturally stable oils such as palm oil and
   composite oils like blends of palm oil and other fats and oils is
   practiced to ensure that maximum benefits are derived from the oils.
   Blending offers functional, nutritional and technical advantages, such
   as tailoring the oil to suit frying applications. The objective of this
   review is to combine and condense the body of research on the
   processing, characterization and use of palm oil especially in frying as
   well as suggest areas that need further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   significantly higher concentrations of Zn and Pb, as compared to soil
   amended with biochar, possibly due to the high cation exchange capacity
   of compost and its positive effect on soil pH. Indicating high ability

Abstract = {{A 3D numerical study is carried out for a vertical direct chill (DC)
   rolling ingot caster for an aluminum alloy (AA-5052). The model
   incorporated the coupled turbulent melt flow and solidification aspects

   The melt is assumed to have been delivered through the entire top cross
   section of the caster. The previously verified in-house computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) code is used to investigate the effects of the
   important parameters such as casting speed, inlet melt superheat, and
   mold-metal contact effective heat transfer coefficient (HTC) on the
   low-head casting process. It is found that the sump depth (SD), liquid
   depth, and mushy thickness (MT) at the center of the ingot increase
   linearly with the casting speed while the shell thickness (ST) at the
   exit of the mold decreases linearly with the casting speed. Useful
   correlations concerning the above quantities with casting speed have

Abstract = {{Field pea (Pisum sativum L.) is an important protein-rich pulse crop
   produced globally. Increasing the lipid content of Pisum seeds through
   conventional and contemporary molecular breeding tools may bring added
   value to the crop. However, knowledge about genetic diversity and lipid
   content in field pea is limited. An understanding of genetic diversity
   and population structure in diverse germplasm is important and a
   prerequisite for genetic dissection of complex characteristics
   andmarker-trait associations. Fifty polymorphic microsatellite markers
   detecting a total of 207 alleles were used to obtain information on
   genetic diversity, population structure and marker-trait associations.
   Cluster analysis was performed using UPGMA to construct a dendrogram
   from a pairwise similarity matrix. Pea genotypes were divided into five
   major clusters. A model-based population structure analysis divided the
   pea accessions into four groups. Percentage lipid content in 35 diverse
   pea accessions was used to find potential associations with the SSR
   markers. Markers AD73, D21, and AA5 were significantly associated with
   lipid content using a mixed linear model (MLM) taking population
   structure (Q) and relative kinship (K) into account. The results of this
   preliminary study suggested that the population could be used
   formarker-trait association mapping studies. (C) 2015 Crop Science

Abstract = {{Some features of galloping detonations near the detonation limits are
   discussed in this paper. The experimental results previously reported in
   Cao et al. (2014), together with additional data obtained in this study
   for six explosive mixtures with different reaction sensitivities, each
   in five different diameter tubes, are analyzed in detail. It is
   established that galloping detonations do not occur in highly
   argon-diluted, stable mixtures. Only in unstable mixtures, susceptible
   to flow fluctuations by thermo-chemical instability, when using in small
   tube diameters (i.e., D <= 12.7 mm), could galloping detonations be
   observed. For the largest tube diameter D = 50.8 mm, the detonation wave
   fails completely when the initial pressure approaches the detonation
   limit even for all unstable mixtures. In addition, the present study
   shows that the initial pressure range for the occurrence of galloping
   detonations decreases rapidly with increasing tube diameter. A
   collection of existing data on galloping detonations indicates that the
   wavelength L of one galloping cycle is on average about 350D within
   experimental variations. Nonetheless, there appears to be some minor
   decreasing trend with increasing tube diameter (i.e., D >= 12.7 mm), or
   with increasing detonation instability of the explosive mixture. The
   amplitude of the galloping cycle is also investigated and the upper
   velocity values show more fluctuations than the lower ones. The upper
   and lower values of the velocity in the galloping cycle at different
   conditions vary from V-CJ to 1.5V(CJ) and 0.3V(CJ) to 0.65V(CJ),
   respectively. To illustrate the role of flow instability on galloping
   detonations, experiments are performed with a spiral inserted into the
   12.7-mm diameter tube to generate perturbations artificially. Detonation
   waves are observed to re-initiate quickly after passing the spiral and
   another cycle of galloping detonation was formed in the remaining part
   of the tube. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The present paper reports the results of a study of the stability of
   spinning detonation near the detonation limits. The detonation velocity
   as well as the structure are observed for long distances of propagation.
   Stable mixtures (with regular transverse wave pattern) and unstable
   mixtures (with irregular transverse wave pattern) are investigated. It
   is found that the local velocity fluctuates as the spinning detonation
   propagates and the fluctuations increase when past the first onset of
   spinning detonation towards the limits (failure). For stable mixtures of
   C2H2 + 2.5O(2) with high argon dilution, the fluctuations are less than
   for unstable mixtures of C2H2 + 5N(2)O and CH4 + 2O(2). Limits are
   indicated by abrupt failure of the detonation after some distance of
   propagation. Long smoked foils (similar to 3 m) indicate that the
   spinning structure is not constant, but varies periodically as the
   detonation propagates. Past the first onset of spinning detonation, the
   fluctuation in the spin structure occurs more frequently and failure is
   evidenced by the disappearance of transverse waves trajectory on the
   smoked foil. For stable mixtures, the spinning detonation structure is
   more stable with a constant pitch and a well defined straight trajectory
   of the ``spin head{''}. However for unstable mixtures, the spinning
   detonation is more unstable with varying spin pitch and a ``wavy{''}
   trajectory of the ``spin head{''}. Also extraneous modes appear
   periodically superimposed on the spin mode. Subjecting the detonation to
   a finite perturbation narrows the range in which spinning detonation can
   be observed. In general the detonation suffers a disruption both in the
   structure and velocity but recovers after some distance downstream of
   the obstacle. However for the very unstable mixture of CH4 + 2O(2), it
   is found that past the limits, abrupt reinitiation occurs downstream of
   the obstacle similar to the phenomenon of the onset of detonation as in
   DDT. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Why is this important?
   Under normal circumstances, donor blood is the best replacement for
   blood. However, there are exceptions:
   During natural epidemics (e.g., HIV, Ebola, etc.) or man-made epidemics
   (terrorism, war, etc.), there is a risk of donor blood being
   contaminated, and donors being disqualified because they have contracted
   disease. Unlike red blood cells (RBCs), blood substitutes can be
   sterilized to remove infective agents.
   Heart attack and stroke are usually caused by obstruction of arterial
   blood vessels. Unlike RBCs, which are particulate, blood substitutes are
   in the form of a solution that can perfuse through obstructed vessels
   with greater ease to reach the heart and brain, as has been demonstrated
   in animal studies.
   Severe blood loss from injuries sustained during accidents, disasters,
   or war may require urgent blood transfusion that cannot wait for
   transportation to the hospital for blood group testing. Unlike RBCs,
   blood substitutes do not have specific blood groups, and can be
   administered on the spot.
   RBCs have to be stored under refrigeration for up to 42 days, and are
   thus difficult to transport and store in times of disaster and at the
   battlefront. Blood substitutes can be stored at room temperature for
   more than 1 year, compared to the RBC shelf life of 1 day, at room
   temperature.
   In cases of very severe hemorrhagic shock, there is usually a safety
   window of 60 min for blood replacement, beyond which there could be
   problems related to irreversible shock. Animal studies show that a
   particular type of blood substitute, with enhanced RBC enzymes, may be
   able to prolong the duration of the safety window.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of ex
   vivo tumors and organs from tumor-bearing mice injected intravenously
   with ultrasmall (<3 nm) tiopronin-capped Au nanoparticles and compares
   the data with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
   Good agreement is seen in particle distributions and concentrations at
   the organ level. The spatial resolution from the imaging techniques
   allows for localization of the particles within organ structures.
   Although the particles do not have a plasmon peak, their absorbance in
   the near-infrared (NIR) is sufficient for PA excitation. PA imaging
   shows an increase of signal as particle concentrations increase, with
   changes in spectrum if particles aggregate. Fluorescence imaging using
   the particles' native NIR emission shows agreement in general intensity
   in each organ, though quenching of emission can be seen at very high
   concentrations. Both of these imaging techniques are noninvasive and
   labor-saving alternatives to organ digestion and ICP-MS and may provide
   insight into cellular distribution of particles. The simple construct
   avoids the use of toxic semiconductor materials or dyes, relying upon
   the gold itself for both the fluorescence and PA signal. This provides a
   useful alternative to more complex approaches to multimodal imaging and
   one that is readily translatable to the clinic. (C) 2015 Society of

Abstract = {{Cold spray is a thermo-mechanical process where the velocity of the
   sprayed particles affects the deformation, bonding, and mechanical
   properties of the deposited material, in the form of splats or coatings.
   At high strain rates, the impact stresses are converted into heat, a
   phenomenon known as adiabatic shear, which leads to grain
   re-crystallization. Grain re-crystallization and growth are shown to
   have a direct impact on the mechanical properties of the cold-sprayed
   material. The present study ties the microstructural features within the
   cold-sprayed Ti splats and the substrate to the bonding mechanism and
   mechanical properties. High-resolution electron channeling contrast
   imaging, electron backscatter diffraction mapping, and nanoindentation
   were used to correlate the microstructure to the mechanical properties
   distribution within the titanium cold-spray splats. The formation of
   nanograins was observed at the titanium splat/substrate interface and
   contributed to metallurgical bonding. An increase in grain
   re-crystallization within the splat and substrate materials was observed
   with pre-heating of the substrate. In the substrate material, the
   predominant mechanism of deformation was twinning. A good relationship
   was found between the hardness and distribution of the twins within the
   substrate and the size distribution of the re-crystallized grains within

Abstract = {{Southern Quebec's Missisquoi Bay, a freshwater body in the northeastern
   portion of Lake Champlain is threatened by algal blooms arising from
   excess nutrient inputs contributed by agricultural watersheds which have
   their outlets in the bay. A version of the Soil and Water Assessment
   Tool (SWAT) model, calibrated in a previous study to estimate annual
   runoff, sediment and total phosphorus (TP) fluxes from the Castor
   subwatershed into the Pike River watershed, which, in turn, flows into
   the Missisquoi Bay, used static landscapes and single land uses to
   arrive at its predictions. However, in reality, farmers do rotate crops.
   Therefore, the present study's objective was to quantify the impact of
   soil heterogeneities on land use change patterns in the Castor
   subwatershed from 1999 to 2011. Data from a 24-point soil survey within
   the Castor subwatershed were partitioned and regionalized into 5, 10,
   15, 20 and 24 heterogeneous regions or configurations. Using the
   standard soils map (with mean properties) employed in several prior
   studies in the subwatershed, a sixth configuration termed
   ``Reference,{''} was also developed. All 6 configurations were
   factorially combined with either 1999 or 2011 land use data to yield 12
   different versions of the SWAT model and quantify the heterogeneities
   and uncertainty of soil properties on land use change. For hydrology, it
   was discovered that there were no marked differences in the predictions,
   which was attributable to the use the SCS-CN subroutine which masks the
   physical properties of soil parameters within the same hydrologic group.
   We evaluated all the models for two periods i.e. 1991-1999 and
   2000-2007. All the 1999 land use SWAT configurations underestimated
   runoff, sediment and TP whereas all the 2011 land use SWAT set ups gave
   higher and more accurate values. For both land use periods, the 5 Region
   models both showed higher and more accurate estimates, than those set
   ups with a greater number of regions, but were similar in accuracy to
   the Reference model set-ups. Since the 5-region configurations showed
   the highest within-zone heterogeneity, it can be concluded that having
   many regions (many sampling points as regions) does not necessarily
   increase SWAT's prediction accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The recording of brain event-related potentials (ERPs) is a widely used
   technique to investigate the neural basis of sensory perception and
   cognitive processing in humans. Due to the low magnitude of ERPs,
   averaging of several consecutive stimuli is typically employed to
   enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR) before subsequent analysis.
   However, when the temporal interval between two consecutive stimuli is
   smaller than the latency of the main ERP peaks, i.e., when the stimuli
   are presented at a fast rate, overlaps between the corresponding ERPs
   may occur. These overlaps are usually dealt with by assuming that there
   is a simple additive superposition between the elicited ERPs and
   consequently performing algebraic waveform subtractions. Here, we test
   this assumption rigorously by providing a statistical framework that
   examines the presence of nonlinear additive effects between overlapping
   ERPs elicited by successive stimuli with short interstimulus intervals
   (ISIs). The results suggest that there are no nonlinear additive effects
   due to the time overlap per se but that, for the range of ISIs examined,
   the second ERP is modulated by the presence of the first stimulus
   irrespective of whether there is time overlap or not. In other words,
   two ERPs that overlap in time can still be written as an addition of two
   ERPs but with the second ERP being different from the first. This
   difference is also present in the case of nonoverlapping ERPs with short
   ISIs. The modulation effect elicited on the second ERP by the first
   stimulus is dependent on the ISI value.}},

   The results showed that early carbonation curing was capable of

   duration should be strictly controlled otherwise subsequent hydration
   might be hindered. Dolomite powder acted as nuclei of crystallization,
   resulting in acceleration of products formation and refinement of

   found that early carbonation could reduce cement dosages to a large

Abstract = {{During the North American crop-growing season, although daytime
   temperatures may remain well above freezing point, nighttime
   temperatures can easily drop below 0 degrees C for a few hours. The
   effects of frost are felt in small operations, such as residential
   gardens, or in specific areas of a larger operation. Various large-scale
   measures exist for crop frost protection but they are neither portable
   nor flexible. A fully automated portable frost-protection misting system
   that makes use of the latent heat of fusion of water was developed and
   tested on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and sweet orange ( Citrus
   sinensis) at the Macdonald Campus of McGill University
   (Saint-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC, Canada). The water tank stores up to 20 gal
   of pressurized water and detachable auxiliary air tanks provide
   additional line pressure. The device is lightweight, portable and
   provides flexible, overhead water misting for two 25-ft rows of crops.
   It activates autonomously using a thermostat, battery pack, and solenoid
   valve, and the outlet pressure is regulated using a pressure regulator.
   It is easily installed and dismantled for expedient relocation and the
   dynamic system of tubing and nozzles can be modified as required. The
   system was tested in subzero ambient air temperature ranging from -7.1
   to 0 degrees C. During misting, the flesh of the targeted tomato fruit
   remained, on average, 3.1 and 3.6 degrees C warmer than ambient
   temperatures. The use of the system is currently limited by the
   infrequent formation of ice on the misting nozzles and in the water
   lines due drastic drops in temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting time to death following the withdrawal of life-sustaining
   therapy is difficult. Accurate predictions may better prepare families
   and improve the process of donation after circulatory death.
   We systematically reviewed any predictive factors for time to death
   after withdrawal of life support therapy.
   Fifteen observational studies met our inclusion criteria. The primary
   outcome was time to death, which was evaluated to be within 60 min in
   the majority of studies (13/15). Additional time endpoints evaluated
   included time to death within 30, 120 min, and 10 h, respectively. While
   most studies evaluated risk factors associated with time to death, a few
   derived or validated prediction tools. Consistent predictors of time to
   death that were identified in five or more studies included the
   following risk factors: controlled ventilation, oxygenation, vasopressor
   use, Glasgow Coma Scale/Score, and brain stem reflexes. Seven unique
   prediction tools were derived, validated, or both across some of the
   studies. These tools, at best, had only moderate sensitivity to
   predicting the time to death. Simultaneous withdrawal of all support and
   physician opinion were only evaluated in more recent studies and
   demonstrated promising predictor capabilities.
   While the risk factors controlled ventilation, oxygenation,
   vasopressors, level of consciousness, and brainstem reflexes have been
   most consistently found to be associated with time to death, the
   addition of novel predictors, such as physician opinion and simultaneous
   withdrawal of all support, warrant further investigation. The currently
   existing prediction tools are not highly sensitive. A more accurate and
   generalizable tool is needed to inform end-of-life care and enhance the
   predictions of donation after circulatory death eligibility.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel-base superalloy, Waspaloy, was linear friction welded (LFWed)
   under different axial shortening conditions of 2.0, 3.4, and 4.6 mm. The
   tensile properties and microhardness of the weldments were investigated
   in the as-LFWed condition and compared with those in the post-weld heat
   treated (PWHTed) condition. Mechanical properties were related to
   microstructures following examination by optical microscopy, high
   resolution scanning electron microscopy, and electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD). Analyses of the EBSD results in terms of the
   misorientation angle distribution, which represents the stored energy,
   were performed. In the as-LFWed condition, the yield strength (YS) and
   ultimate tensile strength CUTS) increased with axial shortening due to
   greater expulsion of the softened interfacial material toward the
   periphery as flash. In contrast, with increasing axial shortening the
   total elongation initially remained constant and then decreased. This
   was also related to the expulsion of the softened interfacial material
   into the bifurcated flash. Extensive dissolution of the strengthening
   phase (gamma') in the weld area during linear friction welding (LFW)
   contributed to the lower YS and UTS in the as-welded condition compared
   to the PWHTed condition where the gamma' particles were recovered. After
   performing post-weld heat treatment (PWHT), the total elongation
   improved due to the relaxation of stored energy and grain growth in the
   thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ). Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We investigate rate selection methods to maximize a utility function of
   a multihop relay network adopting a Chase combining-type hybrid
   automatic repeat request scheme. For supporting delay-limited
   applications, we consider the following two constraints: 1) The number
   of (re) transmissions used in the whole hops is limited to L, and 2) the
   information-theoretic outage probability should be less than or equal to
   epsilon. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the long-term
   average transmission rate of an M-hop relay network by finding the
   optimal round transmission rate {[}b/s/Hz] of each hop while satisfying
   those two constraints. We also consider two reformulated problems and,
   as the solutions to those problems, propose suboptimal search
   algorithms, which significantly reduce the complexity, compared with
   that of the optimal search algorithm corresponding to the solution of
   the original optimization problem. While the original optimization
   problem always requires M-dimensional exhaustive search, the first
   reformulated problem requires M-dimensional exhaustive search only in a
   specific condition, and it obtains a closed-form solution otherwise. The
   second reformulated problem requires 1-D numerical search only in a
   specific condition, and it obtains a closed-form solution otherwise. We
   also show that the relative loss of the solution of the first
   reformulated problem is upper bounded by 2 epsilon.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal suspensions of functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNT

   discharge plasma has on the surface chemistry and structure of CNTs and
   what happens to the plasma-generated functionalities at high
   temperatures. An analysis performed using X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy indicates that longer and higher
   power plasma treatments decrease the sp2 graphitic nature of the CNTs
   without increasing the degree of oxygen functional groups. Heating of
   the functionalized-CNTs up to 350 degrees C in air and 600 degrees C in
   argon, both lead to a substantial decrease in the surface oxygen
   concentration, which can be attributed to the decomposition of
   carboxylic functionalities at low temperatures (< 350 degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the distribution of earth pressure on buried structures is
   essential for the analysis and design of pipes, tunnels and vertical
   shafts. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation
   that has been conducted to measure the distribution of contact pressure
   on rigid pipes using tactile sensing technology. The method allows for a
   continuous pressure profile to be measured around the pipes using
   flexible sheets that can follow the cylindrical shape of the pipes. The
   physical model involves a buried pipe installed in granular material
   subjected to strip surface loading. The effect of introducing a geogrid
   reinforcetnent layer above the pipe on the distribution of contact
   pressure is also examined. To further study the distribution of pressure
   on the buried structure and the soil-geogrid interaction, numerical
   analyses are performed using a multi-scale finite-discrete element
   framework that allows for both the explicit modeling of soil particles
   using discrete elements and the modeling of the embedded structure using
   finite elements. The numerical framework is first validated using the
   experimental results and then used to investigate the detailed behavior
   of the soil-pipe system. (C) 2015 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Abstract = {{The microstructure of a deformed Mg-Al-Ca alloy was imaged using an
   electron-beam energy of 20 keV in a cold field-emission scanning
   electron microscope. The backscattered electron (BSE) micrographs showed
   a non-uniform contrast, the simplest being in the form of parallel
   contours inside a number of grains. This contrast is described as
   rotation contour contrast (RCC) and is attributed to local rotation of
   the crystal during the deformation of the grain. A model is presented to
   relate the rotation of crystal planes about one rotation axis to the
   channeling contrast in the channeling pattern and, consequently, to RCC
   in the BSE micrograph. This model was validated with the electron
   backscatter diffraction technique such that the RCCs in the BSE
   micrograph were reconstructed using the electron backscatter diffraction
   pattern intensities. The appearance of the RCCs was attributed to the
   change in the electron-beam position across a Kikuchi band due to local

Abstract = {{A stirred milling model, based on the concept of shear-volume power, was
   developed and applied to geometries typically found in mineral
   processing systems. Generalising this model permits its use to model
   more complex mill geometries, such as those describing a tapered disk
   mill and the CoBal mill. Due to the additive property of the
   shear-volume power, the calculation of the power of complex mills is
   possible through geometric decomposition. This approach is supported by
   the calculation of the shear-volume power of a number of simple
   geometries commonly found in mills, and is used in the calculation of
   the shear-volume power of a tapered disk mill and the CoBal mill.
   Finally, by incorporating a breakage model, an equation that offers some
   usefulness in the design, operation and optimization of stirred mills is
   presented. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine which level of soil
   information would be sufficient to use with DRAINMOD in predicting
   subsurface drainage. The model was evaluated by predicting and comparing
   with observed monthly and annual subsurface drainage for 14 years
   (1990-2003) from Webster silty clay loam soil experimental plots located
   near Gilmore City, in Pocahontas County, Iowa, USA. Three groups of
   input soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by: (1) determining the
   soil texture and bulk density (BD) from the ISPAID7.1 Soil Survey
   Database, then inputting them into a pedotransfer function model
   (ROSETTA) to determine soil hydraulic parameters (denoted as SP\_1); (2)
   analyzing the soil texture and organic matter (OM) content in laboratory
   and deriving the BD, field capacity (theta(-33) (kPa)) and wilting point
   (theta(-1500) (kPa)) from literature, then inputting them into ROSETTA
   to determine soil hydraulic parameters (SP\_2); and (3) calibrated soil
   hydraulic parameters based on initial inputs from the Soil Survey
   Database plus ROSETTA (SP\_3). All methods resulted in an acceptable
   level of accuracy in predicting monthly and annual subsurface drainage
   volume from the study site and the differences in model performance
   using all these methods were subtle. This suggests that ROSETTA in
   combination with the Soil Survey Database offers a quick and easy way to
   derive the soil hydraulic parameters for running DRAINMOD to simulate
   subsurface drainage systems in Iowa's subsurface drained landscape where
   site-specific soil hydraulic properties may not be available. This
   warrants further evaluation of the model performance at other sites to
   support the findings in this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights

Abstract = {{This article reports the use of a stochastic computer model to study
   hybrid overlapping and functional interaction strategies, where, within
   a given process, different degrees of overlapping or gradually
   increasing or decreasing functional interaction were modeled. The study
   aims to understand the contribution of these strategies to process
   performance, that is, product development effort and span time.
   Simulation results of the hybrid models are discussed in comparison to a
   baseline model, where the baseline process was uniformly overlapped and
   functional interaction was constant throughout its execution. Research
   outcomes indicate that under high information uncertainty, sequential
   processes perform better than any model with overlap. When uncertainty
   is moderate or low, the baseline model outperforms the hybrid models.
   Under high sensitivity conditions, hybrid overlapping models perform
   equally well in comparison to the baseline model with complete overlap,
   and superiorly when information evolution is slow.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical treatments are widely employed to improve the fiber-matrix

   better understand the influence of these treatments on processing
   behavior, this study characterized the surface chemistry and morphology
   of woven flax fabrics treated by acetone, alkaline, silane and diluted
   epoxy. Flax/epoxy composites were then manufactured by resin infusion
   and the flow front and preform thickness evolution was monitored. The
   alkaline treatment was shown to result in a 50 \% increase in equivalent
   permeability due to an increase in porosity which led to a decrease in
   flexural properties. The processing results were found to be in good
   agreement with predictions of a 1-dimensional model. This study suggests
   that infusion times are not considerably affected by the observed
   changes in surface energy. However, other implications of the treatments
   such as an increase in fibrillation can alter the infusion times
   significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the fatigue performance of biocomposites is critical in
   order to increase their acceptance, but current literature in this area
   is mostly limited to nonwoven reinforcements. This paper considers the
   tension-tension fatigue of three different woven flax/epoxy composites,
   for which two of them are prepreg-based and the other is manufactured
   using the Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Moulding (VARTM) process. Good
   fatigue performance of flax fibres comparable to those exhibited by
   glass fibres has shown the potential of this material to be implemented
   in load-bearing applications. The results suggest that minimizing the
   crimp in the yarns is a major concern to increase the resistance to
   fatigue damage in this class of materials. In addition to the three
   mentioned composites, two hybrids of flax/glass/epoxy were manufactured
   using the same VARTM process to check if the fatigue stability of flax
   fibre is extendable to its hybrids. The results show that an increase in
   the strength is possible, while maintaining similar fatigue behaviour as
   the plain flax/epoxy composites.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of diffusion tensor imaging have focused mainly on the role of
   deep white matter tract microstructural abnormalities associated with
   aging and age-related cognitive decline. However, the potential role of
   superficial white matter (SWM) in aging and, by extension,
   cognitive-aging, is less clear. Healthy individuals (n = 141; F/M: 66/75
   years) across the adult lifespan (18-86 years) underwent diffusion
   tensor imaging and a battery of cognitive testing. SWM was assessed via
   a combination of probabilistic tractography and tract-based spatial
   statistics (TBSS). A widespread inverse relationship of fractional
   anisotropy (FA) values in SWM with age was observed. SWM-FA adjacent to
   the precentral gyri was associated with fine-motor-speed, whereas
   performance in visuomotor-attention/processing speed correlated with
   SWM-FA in all 4 lobes of the left-hemisphere and in right
   parieto-occipital SWM-FA (family-wise error corrected p < 0.05).
   Independent of deep white matter-FA, right frontal and right occipital
   SWM-FA-mediated age effects on motor-speed and
   visuomotor-attention/processing speed, respectively. Altogether, our
   results indicate that SWM-FA contributes uniquely to age-related
   cognitive performance, and should be considered as a novel biomarker of
   cognitive-aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We produced novel nanocellulose particles made from cellulose fibers by
   periodate oxidation. For partial oxidation {[}degree of substitution
   (DS) <2], three products were generated after the periodate oxidized
   fibers were heat treated: fibrous cellulose, rod-like dialdehyde
   cellulose (DAC) nanofibers which we refer to as sterically stabilized
   nanocrystalline cellulose (SNCC), and dissolved DAC which is a copolymer
   of cellulose and DAC which we refer to as dialdehyde modified cellulose
   (DAMC). The products were separated by centrifugation and cosolvent
   addition. SNCC has similar dimension (100-200 nm in length and 5-8 nm in
   width) as conventional nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) made by sulfuric
   acid hydrolysis. Several techniques were applied to characterize SNCC
   and its properties are compared to NCC. DAMC was found to be soluble in
   hot water or a few solvents (such as dimethyl formamide and dimethyl
   acetamide) at elevated temperature, but was insoluble in most common
   solvents at room temperature. The molecular weight of DAC (DS = 2)
   produced under various conditions (heating time and temperature) was
   determined by gel permeation chromatography. It was shown that the
   molecular weight decreased from 85.1 to 4.1 kDa with heating time and
   residence time when cooled down to room temperature.}},

Abstract = {{In multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebellar signs and symptoms as well as
   cognitive dysfunction are frequent and contribute to clinical disability
   with only poor response to symptomatic treatment. The current consensus
   paper highlights the broad range of clinical signs and symptoms of MS
   patients, which relate to cerebellar dysfunction. There is considerable
   evidence of cerebellar involvement in MS based on clinical,
   histopathological as well as structural and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) studies. The review of the recent literature,
   however, also demonstrates a high variability of results. These
   discrepancies are, at least partially, caused by the use of different
   techniques and substantial heterogeneity among the patient cohorts in
   terms of disease duration, number of patients, and progressive vs.
   relapsing disease courses. Moreover, the majority of studies were
   cross-sectional, providing little insight into the dynamics of
   cerebellar involvement in MS. Some links between the histopathological
   changes, the structural and functional abnormalities as captured by MRI,
   cerebellar dysfunction, and the clinical consequences are starting to
   emerge and warrant further study. A consensus is formed that this line
   of research will benefit from advances in neuroimaging techniques that
   allow to trace cerebellar involvement at higher resolution. Using a
   prospective study design, multimodal high-resolution cerebellar imaging
   is highly promising, particularly in patients who present with
   radiologically or clinically isolated syndromes or newly diagnosed MS.}},

   Concrete Columns}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Twelve ultrahigh-strength concrete (UHSC) columns confined by
   rectangular hoops and crossties were constructed and tested under pure
   axial load. Primary variables of the investigation were the amount,
   spacing, and configuration of transverse reinforcement, and concrete
   compressive strength, ranging from 50 to 200MPa. The amount of
   transverse reinforcement ranged from 53 to 151\% of that required by the
   American Concrete Institute (ACI) seismic design provisions. Four
   different configurations of transverse reinforcement were investigated
   that included hoops as well as hoops and crossties. The behavior of UHSC
   columns are characterized by sudden spalling of the concrete cover and
   extremely brittle failure unless the columns are adequately confined
   with transverse reinforcement. Therefore, more confinement is required
   in a column with higher concrete strength than in a column with lower
   concrete strength to achieve a reasonable postpeak response and
   sufficient deformability. The amount of transverse reinforcement has a
   pronounced effect on the postpeak behavior of UHSC columns. It is
   concluded that the ACI provisions overestimate the maximum axial load by
   8-21\%; however, the seismic design provisions provide for significant
   postpeak response of the UHSC columns in this test series. A design
   expression is proposed for the amount of seismic confinement for 200MPa
   UHSC columns, based on the effective confinement index. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation of resistance welding of thermoplastic
   composite double lap shear (DLS) joints is presented. DLS specimens
   consisting of unidirectional carbon fibre/polyetheretherketone
   (CF/PEEK), carbon fibre/polyetherketoneketone (CF/PEKK), carbon
   fibre/polyetherimide (CF/PEI) and 8-harness satin weave fabric glass
   fibre/polyetherimide (GF/PEI) composites were resistance welded using a
   stainless steel mesh heating element. The welded specimens were tested
   under static and fatigue loadings, and the quality of the welds was
   examined using optical and scanning electron microscopy. Weld strengths
   of 53, 49, 45 and 34MPa were obtained for CF/PEEK, CF/PEKK, CF/PEI and
   GF/PEI DLS joints, respectively. Indefinite fatigue lives were obtained
   between 20 and 30\% of the ultimate static failure loads of the joints.
   Performances of the resistance-welded DLS and single lap shear (SLS)
   joints were compared. It was shown that the effect of joint geometry,
   that is, DLS versus SLS, on the mechanical performance of the
   resistance-welded joints is minimal, indicating a good resistance of
   welded joints to peel stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Steel reoxidation in the tundish has a significant influence on the
   steel cleanliness and therefore on the mechanical properties of the
   final product. In the present work, the steel reoxidation by two types
   of gunning mass (GM), viz. magnesia- and alumina-based GM, and two types
   of tundish slag, viz. lime-alumina-silica and lime-alumina slags, has
   been investigated. The evolution of the steel composition during the
   test was analyzed and predicted based on thermodynamic and kinetic
   considerations. The calculated steel composition agrees well with
   measured values, when assuming the mass transfer in slag phase limits
   the reoxidation reactions. The oxidation capacity of the gunning mass
   and tundish slag is quantified by calculating the oxygen amount supplied
   from the GM and the slag to the steel phase. It was found that compared
   to alumina GM, magnesia GM exhibits a stronger oxidation capacity due to
   its higher content of reducible oxides (10 wt pct SiO2 + 6 wt pct FeO).
   Compared to lime-alumina-silica tundish slag, lime-alumina slag (with
   more FeO + MnO contents) provides more oxygen to the molten steel in the
   present experimental conditions and consequently shows a stronger
   oxidation capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Copper is becoming recognised as a key cation in a variety of biological
   processes. Copper chelation has been studied as a potential
   anti-angiogenic strategy for arresting tumour growth. Conversely the
   delivery of copper ions and complexes in vivo can elicit a
   pro-angiogenic effect. Previously we unexpectedly found that
   copper-stimulated intraperitoneal angiogenesis was accompanied by
   collagen deposition. Here, in hard tissue, not only was healing
   accelerated by copper, but again enhanced deposition of collagen was
   detected at 2 weeks. Experiments with reconstituted collagen showed that
   addition of copper ions post-fibrillogenesis rendered
   plastically-compressed gels resistant to collagenases, enhanced their
   mechanical properties and increased the denaturation temperature of the
   protein. Unexpectedly, this apparently interfibrillar crosslinking was
   not affected by addition of glucose or ascorbic acid, which are required
   for crosslinking by advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Fibroblasts
   cultured on copper-crosslinked gels did not proliferate, whereas those
   cultured with an equivalent quantity of copper on either tissue culture
   plastic or collagen showed no effect compared with controls. Although
   non-proliferative, fibroblasts grown on copper-cross-linked collagen
   could migrate, remained metabolically active for at least 14 days and
   displayed a 6-fold increase in Mmps 1 and 3 mRNA expression compared
   with copper-free controls. The ability of copper ions to crosslink
   collagen fibrils during densification and independently of AGEs or
   Fenton type reactions is previously unreported. The effect on MMP
   susceptibility of collagen and the dramatic change in cell behaviour on
   this crosslinked ECM may contribute to shedding some light on
   unexplained phenomena as the apparent benefit of copper complexation in
   fibrotic disorders or the enhanced collagen deposition in response to
   localised copper delivery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical data from many application fields confirm that System on
   Chips (SoCs) products implemented in modern deep submicron technologies
   are getting more and more sensitive to transient errors such as
   soft-errors. Although the thorough and comprehensive understanding of
   services that an SoCs provides is an important step for meeting
   stringent system requirements, designers no longer can ignore emerging
   safety and reliability issues in nanoscale devices. In fact, proper
   actions should be taken at various stages of system design to mitigate
   the effect of such errors and enhance safety of SoC in fault prone
   environments. Therefore, SoC designs can benefit from knowing the
   soft-error rate (SER) of different cores as well as the whole system
   failure rate at a very early stage of SoC development. Such data enables
   companies and designers to make the right decision at the right time
   concerning the intensity of error protection mechanisms across different
   modules. This paper proposes a new quantitative method to estimate the
   SER of different modules inside an SoC by means of an executable model.
   The executable model of a system is based on the Unified Modeling
   Language Real-Time standard and is exercised by the actual workload.
   Experimental results show that the proposed quantitative method is 17 \%
   more accurate than the previous error estimations techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Remediation of contaminated sites requires an optimal decision making
   system to develop remediation techniques in a cost-effective and
   efficient manner. A coupled simulation-optimization solution approach,
   based on the finite element method (FEM) and a modified firefly
   algorithm (MFA), is developed in this study for optimal contaminated
   groundwater remediation design. A new modified firefly optimization
   algorithm is proposed by modifying the traditional firefly algorithm in
   three ways: (i) adding memory, (ii) preventing premature convergence to
   local optima and thus accelerating the optimization process, and (iii)
   proposing a new updating formula. Modifications performed in the present
   study improved the applicability and efficiency of the traditional
   metaheuristic firefly optimization algorithm, and led the MFA to
   outperform both its predecessor and conventional optimization methods
   (e.g., genetic algorithm). A hypothetical, unconfined contaminated field
   is considered and remediated by considering pump and treat and flushing
   methods. Pumping rates are considered as design variables while the
   number of pumps and pump locations, as well as the pumping period, are
   initially assumed. The coupled simulation-optimization model (FEM-MFA)
   proposed in this study constitutes an effective way to determine an
   optimal remediation design for a contaminated aquifer. The results of
   the present investigation will contribute to improve groundwater
   management in contaminated aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{Data transfer in opportunistic delay tolerant networks (DTNs) must rely
   on unscheduled sporadic meetings between nodes. The main challenge in
   these networks is to develop a mechanism based on which nodes can learn
   to make nearly optimal forwarding decision rules despite having no a
   priori knowledge of the network topology. The forwarding mechanism
   should ideally result in a high-delivery probability, low-average
   latency, and efficient usage of the network resources. In this paper, we
   propose both centralized and decentralized single-copy message
   forwarding algorithms that, under relatively strong assumptions about
   the networks behavior, minimize the expected latencies from any node in
   the network to a particular destination. After proving the optimality of
   our proposed algorithms, we develop a decentralized algorithm that
   involves a recursive maximum-likelihood procedure to estimate the
   meeting rates. We confirm the improvement that our proposed algorithms
   make in the system performance through numerical simulations on datasets
   from synthetic and real-world opportunistic networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the mechanical properties of sodium silicate-fortified
   backfill, called Gelfill, were investigated by conducting a series of
   laboratory experiments. Two configurations were tested, i.e. Gelfill and
   cemented hydraulic fill (CHF). The Gelfill has an alkali activator such
   as sodium silicate in its materials in addition to primary materials of
   mine backfill which are tailings, water and binders. Large numbers of
   samples of Gelfill and CHF with various mixture designs were cast and
   cured for over 28 d. The mechanical properties of samples were
   investigated using uniaxial compression test, and the results were
   compared with those of reference samples made without sodium silicate.
   The test results indicated that the addition of an appropriate amount of
   an alkali activator such as sodium silicate can enhance the mechanical
   (uniaxial compressive strength) and physical (water retention)
   properties of backfill. The microstructure analysis conducted by mercury
   intrusion porosimetry (MIP) revealed that the addition of sodium
   silicate can modify the pore size distribution and total porosity of
   Gelfill, which can contribute to the better mechanical properties of
   Gelfill. It was also shown that the time and rate of drainage in the
   Gelfill specimens are less than those in CHF specimens made without
   sodium silicate. Finally, the study showed that the addition of sodium
   silicate can reduce the required setting time of mine backfill, which
   can contribute to increase mine production in accordance with the mine
   safety. (C) 2015 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy

   cell morphogenesis}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},

Abstract = {{Both silicate-based bioactive glasses and copper ions have demonstrated
   angiogenic activity and therefore represent promising bioinorganic
   agents for the promotion of vascularization in tissue-engineered
   scaffolds. This study examined the effect of ionic release products from
   45S5 Bioglass (R) doped with 0 and 2.5 wt.\% CuO (BG and Cu-BG
   respectively) on the formation of capillary-like networks by SVEC4-10
   endothelial cells (ECs) seeded in a three-dimensional (3D) type I
   collagen matrix. Copper and silicon release following 24 h dissolution
   increased non-proportionally with Cu-BG concentration in cell culture
   medium, while calcium levels were decreased below the initial medium
   concentration. EC network length, connectivity, branching, quantified by
   means of a 3D morphometric image analysis method, as well as
   proliferation and metabolic activity were reduced in a dose-dependent
   fashion by BG and Cu-BG ionic release products. This reduction was less
   prominent for BG compared to an equivalent concentration of Cu-BG, which
   was attributed to a lower extent of silicon release and calcium
   consumption. Moreover, a CuCl2 dose equivalent to the highest
   concentration of Cu-BG exhibited no effect on ECs. In conclusion, while
   the previously reported pro-angiogenic activity of both Bioglass and
   copper may not be reflected in a direct response of ECs, this study
   provides a maximum glass concentration for non-harmful angiogenic
   stimulation to be examined in future work. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Rare-earth pyrochlores, commonly exhibiting remarkably low lattice
   thermal conductivities, are considered as promising topcoat materials
   for thermal barrier coatings. However the structural origin underlying
   their low thermal conductivities remains unclear. In the present study,
   we investigated the phonon properties of two groups of RE pyrochlores,
   Ln(2)Zr(2)O(7) (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd) and Gd2T2O7 (T = Zr, Hf, Sn, Pb)
   employing density functional theory and quasi harmonic approximation.
   Through the relaxation time approximation (RTA) with Debye model, the
   thermal conductivities of those RE pyrochlores were predicted, showing
   good agreement with experimental measurements. The low thermal
   conductivities of RE pyrochlores were shown to largely come from the
   interference between the low-lying optical branches and acoustic
   branches. The structural origin underlying the low-lying optical
   branches was then clarified and the competition between scattering
   processes in transverse and longitude acoustic branches was discussed.

   sap from the North American maple tree, is a rich source of natural and
   process-derived phenolic compounds. In this work, we report the
   antimicrobial activity of a phenolic-rich maple syrup extract (PRMSE).
   PRMSE exhibited antimicrobial activity as well as strong synergistic
   interaction with selected antibiotics against Gram-negative clinical
   strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa. Among the phenolic constituents of PRMSE, catechol exhibited
   strong synergy with antibiotics as well as with other phenolic
   components of PRMSE against bacterial growth. At sublethal
   concentrations, PRMSE and catechol efficiently reduced biofilm formation
   and increased the susceptibility of bacterial biofilms to antibiotics.
   In an effort to elucidate the mechanism for the observed synergy with
   antibiotics, PRMSE was found to increase outer membrane permeability of
   all bacterial strains and effectively inhibit efflux pump activity.
   Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that PRMSE significantly
   repressed multiple-drug resistance genes as well as genes associated
   with motility, adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence. Overall, this
   study provides a proof of concept and starting point for investigating
   the molecular mechanism of the reported increase in bacterial antibiotic
   susceptibility in the presence of PRMSE.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass combustion generates renewable energy, which is optimized by
   designing a biomass combustion system that controls excess air intake
   and evaluates the ash fouling/slagging potential. The objective of this
   study was to (1) investigate the effect of excess air ratio (EAR) on the
   combustion of switchgrass (Panicum vigratum L.) and hardwood, (2) assess
   their ash fouling and slagging tendencies, and (3) perform an in-depth
   thermogravimetric kinetic analysis to understand their combustion.
   Switchgrass and hardwood contained 17.5 and 17.7 MJ/kg of energy value,
   which was appropriate for heat generation. The greatest energy
   conversion efficiency and combustion completeness rate were obtained
   with an EAR of 20\% for switchgrass and 30\% for hardwood based on our
   combustion system with 4 mm particles of fuel. Kinetic analysis
   confirmed that increasing the oxygen availability resulted in superior
   energy conversion. In general, switchgrass ash had lower fouling and
   slagging tendencies than hardwood owing to its more acidic chemical
   composition. Heat and mass transfer delays were still observed from this
   combustion system, thus making the combustion request more air to even
   achieve a stoichiometric condition. However, rather than an ideal test
   (e.g. single particle combustion), the conclusions made by this study
   were a practical guidance for boiler operations, since the heat and mass
   transfer delays were a common phenomenon in real applications that
   should not be eliminated in our lab-scale studies.. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Delta waves (DW) are present both during sleep and in
   wakefulness. In the first case, DW are considered effectors of synaptic
   plasticity, while in wakefulness, when they appear in the case of brain
   lesions, their functional meaning is not unanimously recognized. To
   throw light on the latter, we aimed to investigate the impact on DW
   exerted by the cortical plasticity-inducing protocol of intermittent
   theta burst stimulation (iTBS).
   Methods: Twenty healthy subjects underwent iTBS (11 real iTBS and nine
   sham iTBS) on the left primary motor cortex with the aim of inducing
   long-term potentiation (LTP)-like phenomena. Five-minute resting
   open-eye 32-channel EEG, right opponens pollicis motor-evoked potentials
   (MEPs), and alertness behavioral scales were collected before and up to
   30 min after the iTBS. Power spectral density (PSD), interhemispheric
   coherence between homologous sensorimotor regions, and intrahemispheric
   coherence were calculated for the frequency bands ranging from delta to
   beta.
   Results: Real iTBS induced a significant increase of both MEP amplitude
   and DW PSD lasting up to 30 min after stimulation, while sham iTBS did
   not. The DW increase was evident over frontal areas ipsilateral and
   close to the stimulated cortex (electrode F3). Neither real nor sham
   iTBS induced significant modifications in the PSD of theta, alpha, and
   beta bands and in the interhemispheric coherence. Behavioral
   visuo-analogic scales score did not demonstrate changes in alertness
   after stimulations. No correlations were found between MEP amplitude and
   PSD changes in the delta band.
   Conclusions: Our data showed that LTP induction in the motor cortex
   during wakefulness, by means of iTBS, is accompanied by a large and
   enduring increase of DW over the ipsilateral frontal cortex.
   Significance: The present results are strongly in favor of a prominent
   role of DW in the neural plasticity processes taking place during the
   awake state. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical

Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{12-33}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the three-dimensional motion characteristics of
   perfect and imperfect Timoshenko microbeams under mechanical and thermal
   forces; the mechanical properties of the microbeam are considered
   temperature-dependent. The centerline of the microbeam is considered to
   be extensible and the equations of motion for the longitudinal,
   transverse, and rotational motions are derived by means of the extended
   Hamilton's principle and the modified couple stress theory. These three
   coupled nonlinear partial differential equations are discretized by
   means of Galerkin's technique, yielding a set of second-order nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations. These equations are solved by means of
   the pseudo-arclength continuation technique and via an eigenvalue
   analysis, for the nonlinear and linear analyses, respectively. The
   geometrically perfect microbeam remains stable at its original static
   equilibrium position up to the temperature when it loses stability by
   divergence via a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation; the post-buckling
   state is obtained and resonant response over it is analysed. For the
   initially imperfect microbeam, as the temperature is increased, the
   initial curvature amplitude increases and no instabilities occur; the
   resonant response of the system over the new deflected configuration is
   examined numerically. The effect of different parameters on the
   nonlinear behaviour of the system is studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   these systems, the systematic trend of CaO- and MgO-containing systems
   were taken into account in the optimization. The molten oxide phase is
   described by the Modified Quasichemical Model. A set of optimized model
   parameters of all phases is obtained which reproduces all available and
   reliable thermodynamic and phase equilibrium data. The unexplored binary
   and ternary phase diagrams of the MnO-B2O3 and MnO-B2O3-SiO2 systems
   have been predicted for the first time. The thermodynamic calculations
   relevant to the oxidation of advanced high-strength steels containing
   boron were performed to find that B can form liquid B2O3-SiO2-rich phase
   in the annealing furnace under reducing N-2-H-2 atmosphere, which can
   significantly influence the wetting behavior of liquid Zn in Zn
   galvanizing process.}},

Abstract = {{Ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems exhibit high thermal performance.
   Consequently, they are increasingly used to heat and cool buildings. The
   thermal performance of GSHP systems strongly depends on the operation
   ground temperature and thermal quality of the building envelope (TQBE).
   The operation ground temperature is a function of mean annual air
   temperature and annual thermal load of the building. The thermal load
   depends on the TQBE and outside temperature. Given that ongoing global
   climate change (GCC) affects air temperatures, it also affects the
   performance of GSHP systems. The magnitude of this impact on a given
   GSHP system strongly depends on local weather conditions and the TQBE.
   The overall aim of the current study is to investigate the impact of GCC
   on the performance of GSHP systems in different climate. To achieve this
   aim, three cities located in three climate categories were considered:
   Stockholm, Sweden (cold), Istanbul, Turkey (mild), and Doha, Qatar
   (hot). In each city, two buildings were modeled. One was built according
   to current local building regulations, while the other was built to have
   a TQBE lower than the standard TQBE. Simulations were run for present
   (2014) and future (projected for 2050) outdoor designing conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper is dedicated to investigate the dynamic instability of
   functionally graded nano-bridges considering Casimir attraction and
   electric filed actuation. The nano-bridge is initially at rest and
   actuated by suddenly DC voltage. The fundamental frequency of the system
   is obtained asymptotically by employing modern approach namely Parameter
   Expansion Method (PEM). The effects of actuation voltage, properties of
   FGM materials and intermolecular fore on the dynamic pull-in behavior
   are studied. It is exhibited that in order to achieve the acceptable
   approximations for fundamental frequency as well as the analytic
   solution, six terms in series expansions should be taken into account.
   Comparison between the obtained results based on the asymptotic analysis
   and the reported results in the literature, verify the strength of the
   analytical procedure. Finally, the influences of applied voltage and
   gradient power of functionally graded materials on the dynamic pull-in
   voltage and pull-in time of vibrating nano-actuators are explained. (C)

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{94-105}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The traditional spectrum sensing methods based on second order
   statistics are in general not applicable to detecting a primary user
   with unknown parameters in non-Gaussian noises. This paper presents a
   novel spectrum sensing scheme based on fractional lower order moment
   (FLOM) for the detection of a primary user in non-Gaussian noise that
   are modeled by the alpha-stable distribution. The new detector does not
   require any a priori knowledge about the primary user (PU) signal and
   channels. The statistics of the proposed FLOM detector are defined in a
   multi-user cooperative framework and its detection and false alarm
   probabilities as well as deflection coefficient are analyzed for both
   non-fading and Rayleigh fading communication channels between the
   primary and secondary users. The detection performance of the proposed
   method versus the generalized signal-to-noise ratio, the characteristic
   exponent alpha and the number of cooperative users is also studied along
   with comparison to the Cauchy detector through computer simulations.
   Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed FLOM detector
   has a much better performance than the Cauchy detector in the
   alpha-stable distributed noise environment. It is also shown that
   multi-user cooperative sensing leads to a significantly higher
   probability of detection than the single user version. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The variation in the surface reactivity of gold nanorods (GNR) is
   explored by density functional theory (DFT) simulations of the different
   facets. The physical and chemical properties of Au310 and Au520
   surfaces, recently detected on the GNR tips, were compared with
   conventional Au100 and Au111 surfaces. Due to the tight gold packing,
   the sloped Au111 surfaces have the highest binding energy with rigid
   ligands, whereas the Au310 have the lowest. The observed correspondence
   between the ligand binding energies and the surface moduli of elasticity
   demonstrates that the overall monolayer structure, stability and
   reactivity is a balance between the ligand induced surface strain and
   the interligand strain. The GNR tips are able to distribute the ligand
   induced strain with minimal surface reorganization due to a high modulus
   of elasticity combined with extra free volume within the ligand shell. A
   simulation of the halide-surface interaction, consisting Of multiple
   bond breaking and forming points, showed that the halides will induce
   the same surface strain but halides with reduced ligand-to-ligand
   interaction can move freely around the gold surface. More importantly,
   the charge transfer between halide to gold depends mainly on this
   mobility and is a factor in the role of halides as shape directing
   agents in gold nanoparticle synthesis. These simulations reveal some of
   the key factors that must be considered to effectively functionalize
   GNRs for specific applications.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene hydrogels/aerogels are emerging three-dimensional graphene

   reduction of graphene oxide. Unlike the porous bulk of the hydrogel, the
   shell is a compact, highly ordered layer with a higher electrical
   conductivity. Shell formation is dependent upon the surface anchoring of
   graphene oxide at the liquid air and liquid-container interfaces. By
   purposefully weakening surface anchoring of graphene oxide using mild
   thermal or chemical prereduction method prior to hydrothermal reduction,
   we have succeeded in completely suppressing shell formation in the
   graphene hydrogel. The resulting graphene hydrogel shows a lower volume
   reduction with a porous bulk structure immediately accessible from the

   transition can be clearly measured, which is separated about 0.6 eV from
   the band-edge transition, consistent with the Mg activation energy in
   AlN. The electrical conduction measurements indicate an activation
   energy of 23meV at 300K-450K temperature range, which is significantly
   smaller than the Mg-ionization energy in AlN, suggesting the p-type
   conduction being mostly related to hopping conduction. The free hole

Abstract = {{Five Al-Al2O3 coatings were deposited by gas dynamic cold spray, using
   feedstocks containing 0, 10, and 50 wt.\% of Al2O3 particles admixed
   into commercially pure Al powders. Two feedstocks were made using Al2O3
   powders with an angular, blocky Al2O3 morphology, two feedstocks used
   Al2O3 powders with a spherical morphology, and the fifth consisted of
   100\% Al. The influence of Al2O3 concentration and morphology in the
   feedstock powders on the cold spray coating formation was measured in
   terms of Al2O3 recovery in the coatings, deposition efficiency, and
   microstructural analysis. The Al-Al2O3 coatings were then subjected to
   dry sliding wear experiments from which the friction, wear, and
   microevolution of third body structures in the wear track and transfer
   film were observed. The spherical Al2O3 morphology was associated with
   improved tribological behavior compared to the angular morphology when
   comparing similar coating concentrations of Al2O3. Crown Copyright (C)

   the Peierls-Nabarro model, demonstrate that the shuffle slip is favored
   over the glide slip given the markedly lower Peierls energy and stress
   of the shuffle slip. Our findings also indicate that in general slip
   motions for (a+c)-edge dislocations are only possible at elevated
   temperature, and the necessity of further studies of thermally activated
   processes to better understand the dynamics of (a+c) dislocations in

   kinetics of polypropylene}},
Journal = {{THERMOCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{608}},
Pages = {{30-39}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Porous cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) agglomerates were prepared using
   spray-freeze drying (SFD) and incorporated into polypropylene (PP) via
   melt compounding. PP and PP/CNC nanocomposites (PPCNC) containing 1
   wt.\% CNC were subjected to a series of isothermal crystallization
   studies. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the
   crystallization rate of PPCNC is faster than that of neat PP. Different
   isothermal crystallization kinetics models, including those proposed by
   Avrami, Malkin and Tobin, were applied in the analysis of the DSC
   results. All the above models indicated a faster crystallization rate
   for PPCNC. However, the Avrami model provided a better fit to the
   experimental results. All these models exhibited higher activation
   energy for PPCNC than that of neat PP. PPCNC also had higher equilibrium
   melting point. Lauritzen-Hoffman nucleation kinetics revealed that the
   presence of CNC contributed to a higher magnitude of the work required
   for chain folding during isothermal crystallization. It was also found
   that the initial lamellae thickness during isothermal crystallization of
   PPCNC was higher than that of neat PP. This could be due to steric
   hurdles introduced by CNC particles, leading to a reduction in the
   transport of the PP chains into crystal units. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   equation analog system}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{An analog to the equations of compressible flow that is based on the
   inviscid Burgers equation is utilized to investigate the effect of
   spatial discreteness of energy release on the propagation of a
   detonation wave. While the traditional Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) treatment of
   a detonationwave assumes that the energy release of the medium is
   homogeneous through space, the system examined here consists of sources
   represented by delta functions embedded in an otherwise inert medium.
   The sources are triggered by the passage of the leading shock wave
   following a delay that is either of fixed period or randomly generated.
   The solution for wave propagation through a large array (10(3)-10(4)) of
   sources in one dimension can be constructed without the use of a finite
   difference approximation by tracking the interaction of
   sawtooth-profiled waves for which an analytic solution is available. A
   detonation-like wave results from the interaction of the shock and
   rarefaction waves generated by the sources. The measurement of the
   average velocity of the leading shock front for systems of both regular,
   fixed-period and randomized sources is found to be in close agreement
   with the velocity of the equivalent CJ detonation in a uniform medium,
   wherein the sources have been spatially homogenized. This result may
   have implications for the applicability of the CJ criterion to
   detonations in highly heterogeneous media (e.g., polycrystalline, solid
   explosives) and unstable detonations with a transient and
   multidimensional structure (e.g., gaseous detonation waves).}},

Title = {{Rheo-NMR study of water-based cellulose liquid crystal system at high
   shear rates}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{18-25}},
Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Since long ago cellulosic lyotropic liquid crystals were thought as
   potential materials to produce fibers competitive with spidersilk or
   Kevlar, yet the processing of high modulus materials from
   cellulose-based precursors was hampered by their complex rheological
   behavior. In this work, by using the Rheo-NMR technique, which combines
   deuterium NMR with rheology, we investigate the high shear rate regimes
   that may be of interest to the industrial processing of these materials.
   Whereas the low shear rate regimes were already investigated by this
   technique in different works {[}1-4], the high shear rates range is
   still lacking a detailed study. This work focuses on the orientational
   order in the system both under shear and subsequent relaxation process
   arising after shear cessation through the analysis of deuterium spectra
   from the deuterated solvent water. At the analyzed shear rates the
   cholesteric order is suppressed and a flow-aligned nematic is observed
   which for the higher shear rates develops after certain time periodic
   perturbations that transiently annihilate the order in the system.
   During relaxation the flow aligned nematic starts losing order due to
   the onset of the cholesteric helices leading to a period of very low
   order where cholesteric helices with different orientations are forming
   from the aligned nematic, followed in the final stage by an increase in
   order at long relaxation times corresponding to the development of
   aligned cholesteric domains. This study sheds light on the complex
   rheological behavior of chiral nematic cellulose-based systems and opens
   ways to improve its processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{382}},
Pages = {{124-133}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The coercivity and hysteresis losses of non oriented electrical steels
   (NOES) are determined by metallurgical parameters evolved during their
   manufacturing process. Although the links between grain size, inclusion
   content, orientation and these magnetic properties are well established,
   the effects of misorientation, especially with respect to the magnetic
   easy axis, are mostly unexplored. From this work examining NOES samples
   with ``typical{''} grain size and inclusion distributions, but with
   texture variations induced by lab processing, the major factors
   determining the coercivity and hysteresis losses were limited to the
   magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (E-a) and LAM, a newly created easy
   axis misorientation parameter, It is believed that E-a is a measure of
   the contribution of domain rotation processes, while EAM is a
   representation of the ability of the sample to nucleate reverse magnetic
   domains. The utilization of EAM allows for a better understanding of the
   influence of metallurgical parameters on the magnetic properties,
   especially for samples with large differences in processing and texture.

Title = {{Functional and structural correlates of memory in patients with mesial
   temporal lobe epilepsy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) often show
   material-specific memory impairment (verbal for left, visuospatial for
   right hemisphere), which can be exacerbated following surgery aimed at
   the epileptogenic regions of medial and anterolateral temporal cortex.
   There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that characterization of
   structural and functional integrity of these regions using MRI can aid
   in prediction of postsurgical risk of further memory decline. We
   investigated the nature of the relationship between structural and
   functional indices of hippocampal integrity with pre-operative memory
   performance in a group of 26 patients with unilateral mTLE. Structural
   integrity was assessed using hippocampal volumes, while functional
   integrity was assessed using hippocampal activation during the encoding
   of novel scenes. We quantified structural and functional integrity in
   terms of asymmetry, calculated as (L - R)/(L + R). Factor scores for
   verbal and visual memory were calculated from a clinical database and an
   asymmetry score (verbal visual) was used to characterize memory
   performance. We found, as expected, a significant difference between
   left and right mTLE (RILE) groups for hippocampal volume asymmetry, with
   each group showing an asymmetry favoring the unaffected temporal lobe.
   Encoding activation asymmetry showed a similar pattern, with left mTLE
   patients showing activation preferential to the right hemisphere and
   RTLE patients showing the reverse. Finally, we demonstrated that
   functional integrity mediated the relationship between structural
   integrity and memory performance for memory asymmetry, suggesting that
   even if structural changes are evident, ultimately it is the functional
   integrity of the tissue that most closely explains behavioral
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Electro-dewatering (ED) is a novel technology to reduce the overall
   costs of residual biosolids processing, transport, and disposal. In this
   study, we investigated Joule heating and pH as parameters controlling
   the dewaterability limit, dewatering rate, and energy efficiency.
   Temperature-controlled electrodes revealed that Joule heating enhances
   water removal by increasing evaporation and electro-osmotic flow. High
   temperatures increased the dewatering rate, but had little impact on the
   dewaterability limit and energy efficiency. Analysis of horizontal
   layers after 15-min ED suggests electroosmotic flow reversal, as
   evidenced by a shifting of the point of minimum moisture content from
   the anode toward the cathode. This flow reversal was also confirmed by
   the pH at the anode being below the isoelectric point, as ascertained by
   pH titration. The important role of pH on ED was further studied by
   adding acid/base solutions to biosolids prior to ED. An acidic pH
   reduced the biosolids charge while simultaneously increasing the
   dewatering efficiency. Thus, process optimization depends on trade-offs
   between speed and efficiency, according to physicochemical properties of
   the biosolids microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method to mitigate the chromatic dispersion (CD)-induced
   power fading effect (PFE) in high-speed and short-reach carrier-less
   amplitude and phase (CAP) systems using the degenerate four-wave mixing
   (DFWM) effect and a decision feedback equalizer (DFE). Theoretical and
   numerical investigations reveal that DFWM components produced by the
   interaction between the main carrier and the signal sideband help to
   mitigate PFE in direct detection systems. By optimizing the launch
   power, a maximum reach of 60 km in single mode fiber (SMF-e +) at 1530nm
   is experimentally demonstrated for a 40 Gbit/s CAP32 system. In
   addition, we study the performance of a decision feedback equalizer
   (DFE) and a traditional linear equalizer (LE) in a channel with non-flat
   in-band frequency response. The superior PFE tolerance of DFE is
   experimentally validated, and thereby, the maximum reach is extended to
   80 km. To the best of our knowledge, this is the twice the longest
   transmission distance reported so far for a single-carrier 40 Gbit/s CAP
   system around 1550 nm. (C)2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{When a nematic liquid crystal is confined to a capillary tube with
   strong homeotropic anchoring conditions, unstable +1 disclinations lines
   can branch into a pair of +1/2 lines forming loops attached to the +1
   axial line through branch points. The shape of the +1/2 disclination
   lines is a function of the confinement and the Frank elasticity. Our
   previous work shows that nematic liquid crystals under cylindrical
   confinement display aradial-to-planar polar defect texture transition
   through the nucleation and uniform motion of a disclination branch point
   that separates a high charge disclination from two lower charge ones.
   Here, we present the existence of a branch point for a nematic LC
   confined to different conical geometries with homeotropic anchoring.
   Determination of the defect geometry in conjunction with our model
   provides a means of characterizing the elasticity of LCs. Our results
   show that a larger conical angle reduces the length at which
   disclination curvature relaxes to zero and it also leads to less bending
   energy. These new findings are useful to assess the Frank elasticity of
   the nematic LCs and predict novel defect structures under confinement.}},

Abstract = {{The structural and mechanical properties of methane and carbon dioxide

   Well-established equations of state of solids and exchange-correlation
   functionals were used for fitting the unit lattice total energy as a

   two gas hydrates were determined by energy-strain analyses. The
   polycrystalline elastic properties were also calculated from the unit
   lattice results. The final results for methane hydrate agree well with
   available experimental data and with other theoretical results. The two
   gas hydrates were found to be highly elastically isotropic, but they
   differed significantly in shear properties. The presented results for
   carbon dioxide hydrates are the first complete set reported so far. The

Abstract = {{Cadmium coatings are used in the aerospace industry primarily as a
   corrosion resistant plating, but also in applications where tribological
   properties are also important. Due to the carcinogenic nature of Cd,
   many coatings have been proposed as replacements, with Zn-Ni being the
   leading candidate. In this study, we examine two Zn-Ni coatings with
   differences in their surface roughness and their content of through
   thickness defects, including pores and cracks. The morphological
   differences between the coatings had a noticeable effect on their
   fretting wear behavior.
   A customized tribometer, with a reciprocating rounded pin (AISI 440C
   steel) on flat (Zn-Ni) geometry, was used to perform fretting wear
   tests. The two morphologically different Zn-Ni coatings were tested at
   room temperature using +/- 70, 100 and 150 mu m displacements and 133 N
   and 447 N constant normal loads. The surface of the wear scar was
   analyzed using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy for changes in morphology and chemistry.
   Wear scar depth was measured from surface profiles obtained using
   confocal microscopy.
   Hysteresis fretting loops of the tests showed that for both coatings, at
   +/- 70 mu m displacement remains in no slip condition, at +/- 100 mu m
   in the mixed slip condition, and at +/- 150 mu m displacement remains in
   gross slip condition. Although the coatings had similar stick-slip
   behavior, the smoother coating has a slower progression of wear from the
   no slip to gross slip conditions than the rougher coatings. Also,
   differences in the wear scar morphologies are attributed to the
   differences in the coating morphologies, which resulted in different
   wear and velocity accommodation mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A novel technique for electroencephalogram (EEG) compression is proposed
   in this paper. This technique models the intrinsic dependence inherent
   between the different EEG channels. It is based on methods borrowed from
   dipole fitting that is usually used in order to find a solution to the
   classic problems in EEG analysis: inverse and forward problems. To
   compress the EEG signals, the forward model based on approximated source
   dipoles is first used to provide an approximation of the recorded
   signals. Then, (based on a smoothness factor) appropriate coding
   techniques are suggested to compress the residuals of the fitting
   process. Results show that this technique works well for different
   recordings and for different patients, and is even able to provide
   near-lossless compression for certain types of recordings.}},

Abstract = {{The regeneration of strong (>= 6 mol/L) hydrochloric acid (HCl) is an

   solution (up to 5 mol/L) with concentrated H2SO4 (up to 18 mol/L).
   Super-azeotropic HCl (up to 9.5 mol/L, similar to 30 wt.\%) and calcium
   sulfate alpha-hemihydrate (alpha-HH) was produced at 60 degrees C.
   Calcium sulfate dihydrate (DH) could also be produced but with lower
   strength HCl (sub-azeotropic <= 6 mol/L) and at <= 40 degrees C. By
   maintaining a low CaCl2 concentration (0.1-0.4 mol/L) the growth of
   metastable alpha-HH crystals (30-60 mu m crystal size) was promoted due
   to a favorable supersaturation regime. Finally, it was determined that
   the super-azeotropic HCl producing crystallization process can be
   carried out in a thermally autogenous mode at 60 degrees C taking
   advantage of the exothermic character of the reaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions have increased research efforts
   into alternatives in bio-based processes. With regard to transport fuel,
   bioethanol and biodiesel are still the main biofuels used. It is
   expected that future production of these biofuels will be based on
   processes using either non-food competing biomasses, or characterised by
   low CO2 emissions. Many microorganisms, such as microalgae, yeast,
   bacteria and fungi, have the ability to accumulate oils under special
   culture conditions. Microbial oils might become one of the potential
   feed-stocks for biodiesel production in the near future. The use of
   these oils is currently under extensive research in order to reduce
   production costs associated with the fermentation process, which is a
   crucial factor to increase economic feasibility. An important way to
   reduce processing costs is the use of wastes as carbon sources. The aim
   of the present review is to describe the main aspects related to the use
   of different oleaginous microorganisms for lipid production and their
   performance when using bio-wastes. The possibilities for combining
   hydrogen (H-2) and lipid production are also explored in an attempt for
   improving the economic feasibility of the process.}},

Abstract = {{We studied changes in articular calcified cartilage (ACC) and
   subchondral bone (SCB) in the third carpal bones (C3) of Standardbred
   racehorses with naturally-occurring repetitive loading-induced
   osteoarthritis (OA). Two osteochondral cores were harvested from dorsal
   sites from each of 15 post-mortem C3 and classified as control or as
   showing early or advanced OA changes from visual inspection. We
   re-examined X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) image sets for the
   presence of high-density mineral infill (HDMI) in ACC cracks and
   possible high-density mineralized protrusions (HDMP) from the ACC
   mineralizing (tidemark) front (MF) into hyaline articular cartilage
   (HAC). We hypothesized and we show that 20-mu m mu CT resolution in
   10-mm diameter samples is sufficient to detect HDMI and HDMP: these are
   lost upon tissue decalcification for routine paraffin wax histology
   owing to their predominant mineral content. The findings show that mu CT
   is sufficient to discover HDMI and HDMP, which were seen in 2/10
   controls, 6/9 early OA and 8/10 advanced OA cases. This is the first
   report of HDMI and HDMP in the equine carpus and in the Standardbred
   breed and the first to rely solely on mu CT. HDMP are a candidate cause
   for mechanical tissue destruction in OA.}},

Abstract = {{Crude glycerol from the biodiesel manufacturing process is being
   produced in increasing quantities due to the expanding number of
   biodiesel plants. It has been previously shown that, in batch mode,
   semi-anaerobic fermentation of crude glycerol by Enterobacter aerogenes
   can produce biohydrogen and bioethanol simultaneously. The present study
   demonstrated the possible scaling-up of this process from small batches
   performed in small bottles to a 3.6-L continuous stir tank reactor
   (CSTR). Fresh feed rate, liquid recycling, pH, mixing speed, glycerol
   concentration, and waste recycling were optimized for biohydrogen and
   bioethanol production. Results confirmed that E. aerogenes uses small
   amounts of oxygen under semi-anaerobic conditions for growth before
   using oxygen from decomposable salts, mainly NH4NO3, under anaerobic
   condition to produce hydrogen and ethanol. The optimal conditions were
   determined to be 500 rpm, pH 6.4, 18.5 g/L crude glycerol (15 g/L
   glycerol) and 33\% liquid recycling for a fresh feed rate of 0.44
   mL/min. Using these optimized conditions, the process ran at a lower
   media cost than previous studies, was stable after 7 days without
   further inoculation and resulted in yields of 0.86 mol H-2/mol glycerol
   and 0.75 mol ethanol/mole glycerol.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the extended Hamilton's principle is used to obtain the
   linear equation of motion and boundary conditions for a cylinder
   flexibly supported by a translational and a rotational spring at the
   upstream end and free at the other, and subjected to axial flow. The
   equation of motion is solved numerically via Galerkin's method for a
   system in which the stiffness of the translational spring is infinitely
   large, while that of the rotational spring is zero, i.e. a pinned-free
   cylinder. For such a system, the condition for occurrence of
   non-oscillatory rigid-body instability is obtained analytically. Also,
   the Adomian Decomposition Method is used to obtain the critical flow
   velocity for divergence of pinned-free cylinders analytically. Finally,
   previously obtained experimental results for pinned-free cylinders are
   compared with those obtained numerically using the present theory. (C)

Title = {{A Reparametrization of the Rotation Matrix in Rigid-Body Dynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The parametrization of a rigid-body rotation is a classical subject in
   rigid-body dynamics. Euler angles, the rotation matrix and quaternions
   are the most common representations. However, Euler angles are known to
   be prone to singularities, besides not being frame-invariant. The full 3
   x 3 rotation matrix conveys all the motion information, but poses the
   problem of an excessive number of parameters, nine, to represent a
   transformation that entails only three independent parameters.
   Quaternions are singularity-free, and thus, ideal to study rigid-body
   kinematics. However, quaternions, comprising four components, are
   subject to one scalar constraint, which has to be included in the
   mathematical model of rigid-body dynamics. The outcome is that the use
   of quaternions imposes one algebraic constraint, even in the case of
   mechanically unconstrained systems. An alternative parametrization is
   proposed here, that (a) comprises only three independent parameters; (b)
   is fairly robust to representation singularities; and (c) satisfies the
   quaternion scalar constraint intrinsically. To illustrate the concept, a
   simple, yet nontrivial case study is included. This is a mechanical
   system composed of a rigid, toroidal wheel rolling without slipping or
   skidding on a horizontal surface. The simulation algorithm based on the
   proposed parametrization and fundamentally on quaternions, together with
   the invariant relations between the quaternion rate of change and the
   angular velocity, is capable of reproducing the falling of the wheel
   under deterministic initial conditions and a random disturbance acting
   on the tilting axis. Finally, a comparative study is included, on the
   numerical conditioning of the parametrization proposed here and that
   based on Euler angles. Ours shows as broader well-conditional region
   than Euler angles offer. Moreover, the two parametrizations exhibit an
   outstanding complementarity: where the conditioning of one degenerates,
   the other comes to rescue.}},

Abstract = {{Localization and tracking of a mobile node (MN) in non-line-of-sight
   (NLOS) scenarios, based on time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements, is
   considered in this paper. We develop a constrained form of a square-root
   unscented Kalman filter (SRUKF), where the sigma points of the unscented
   transformation are projected onto the feasible region by solving
   constrained optimization problems. The feasible region is the
   intersection of several disks formed by the NLOS measurements. We show
   how we can reduce the size of the optimization problem and formulate it
   as a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program, which depends
   on the Cholesky factor of the a posteriori error covariance matrix of
   the SRUKF. As a result of these modifications, the proposed constrained
   SRUKF (CSRUKF) is more efficient and has better numerical stability
   compared to the constrained unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Through
   simulations, we also show that the CSRUKF achieves a smaller
   localization error compared to other techniques and that its performance
   is robust under different NLOS conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Ice accretion on the surface of an electrothermal anti-icing system
   around a rotorcraft engine air intake was investigated on the basis of
   computational and experimental methods. A compressible
   Navier-Stokes-Fourier computational fluid dynamics code was used to
   determine the fully three-dimensional flowfield around the inlet of the
   engine and the environment control system. Three-dimensional droplet
   trajectory and ice accretion codes based on the Eulerian approach,
   DROP3D and ICE3D modules of FENSAP-ICE, were used to calculate the
   collection efficiency and ice shape on the surface of an engine air
   intake. Furthermore, an experimental study using an icing wind tunnel
   was conducted to validate the computational predictions of ice accretion
   on the surface of the electrothermal anti-icing system in heat-off and
   heat-on modes. It is shown that the general shape and range of ice
   accretion obtained by numerical calculations are in close agreement with
   experimental observation. In particular, two features of glaze ice
   formation identified from computational results, the upper parts of the
   intake with the largest ice accretion and the narrow region between
   these parts showing relatively small ice accumulation, were confirmed in
   the experimental study.}},

   light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been studied with the use of
   goniometric setup. A maximum polarization ratio of approximate to 0.7
   has been obtained from the edge emission of NW array-based LEDs and the
   light is mainly polarized parallel to the c-axis of NWs. The nearly
   isotropic polarization response from a core-shell NW LED structure is
   also observed, and it is found that the degree of polarization is
   strongly depended on the NW diameter. With the growth of the AlGaN
   shell, the resulting diameter of core-shell NWs becomes larger and is
   comparable to the emission wavelength, thus weakening the optical
   confinement effect and the polarization behavior. The size-dependent
   polarization properties of NW structures are further verified by the
   finite-difference time-domain simulation. NWs with diameters much less
   than the emission wavelength render a strong contrast between the p- and
   s-polarized light emissions. (Left) FE-SEM image of MBE-grown NWs

Abstract = {{The surface pressure distributions and flow patterns developed on and
   around a NACA 0012 airfoil undergoing heaving and pitching were
   investigated at Re = 3.6 x 10(4). Despite extensive investigations
   conducted by researchers elsewhere, the surface pressure measurements
   are, however, not readily available in the open archives, which are of
   importance not only in understanding the unsteady-airfoil boundary-layer
   flow but also for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) validation.
   Nevertheless, the results show that the behavior of the surface pressure
   distribution and the flow pattern of pure heaving closely resembled
   those of pure pitching. For combined heaving and pitching, the critical
   aerodynamic values (such as dynamic C-l,C-max, peak negative C-m,
   C-l-hysteresis and torsional damping) always exhibited a maximum value
   at phase shift phi = 0 deg. More interestingly, the phi = 180 deg phase
   shift produced a virtually unchanged surface pressure distribution over
   an entire combined motion cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in large area graphene growth have led to many
   applications in different areas. In the present study, chemical vapor
   deposited (CVD) monolayer graphene supported on glass substrate was
   examined as electrode material for electrochemical biosensing
   applications. We report a facile strategy for covalent functionalization
   of CVD monolayer graphene by electrochemical reduction of carboxyphenyl
   diazonium salt prepared in situ in acidic aqueous solution. The
   carboxyphenyl-modified graphene is characterized using Raman
   spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS). We also show that the number of grafted carboxyphenyl groups on
   the graphene surface can be controlled by the number of cyclic
   voltammetry (CV) scans used for electrografting. We further present the
   fabrication and characterization of an immunosensor based on
   immobilization of ovalbumin antibody on the graphene surface after the
   activation of the grafted carboxylic groups via EDC/NHS chemistry. The
   binding between the surface-immobilized antibodies and ovalbumin was
   then monitored using Faradaic EIS in {[}Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) solution. The
   percentage change of charge transfer resistance (R (ct)) after binding
   exhibited a linear dependence for ovalbumin concentrations ranging from
   1.0 pg center dot mL(-1) to 100 ng center dot mL(-1), with a detection
   limit of 0.9 pg center dot mL(-1). Our results indicate good sensitivity
   of the developed functionalized CVD graphene platform, paving the way
   for using CVD monolayer graphene in a variety of electrochemical
   biosensing devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we provide an overview on the recent advances made in
   InN, including both planar and nanowire structures. With the improved
   epitaxial growth process, the background electron concentration can be
   reduced to low 10(17) and 10(13) cm(-3) ranges in planar and nanowire
   structures, respectively, with the latter approaching the intrinsic
   limit of InN at room temperature. Extensive studies have shown that the
   measurement of p-type conduction in InN epilayers has been fundamentally
   limited by the presence of electron accumulation on the c-plane
   surfaces. In contrast, the nonpolar grown surfaces of InN are found to
   be completely free of electron accumulation. Moreover, through direct Mg
   dopant incorporation, the surfaces (nonpolar m-plane) of InN nanowires
   can be transformed from intrinsic to nearly p-type degenerate, which has
   led to the first direct measurement of p-type conduction in InN. (C)

Abstract = {{In Canada, as many as 20 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have
   been detected in samples of treated drinking water. The presence of
   these PhACs in drinking water raises important questions as to the human
   health risk posed by their potential appearance in drinking water
   supplies and the extent to which they indicate that other PhACs are
   present but have not been detected using current analytical methods.
   Therefore, the goal of the current investigation was to conduct a
   screening-level assessment of the human health risks posed by the
   aquatic release of an evaluation set of 335 selected PhACs. Predicted
   and measured concentrations were used to estimate the exposure of
   Canadians to each PhAC in the evaluation set. Risk evaluations based on
   measurements could only be performed for 17 PhACs and, of these, all
   were found to pose a negligible risk to human health when considered
   individually. The same approach to risk evaluation, but based on
   predicted rather than measured environmental concentrations, suggested
   that 322 PhACs of the evaluation set, when considered individually, are
   expected to pose a negligible risk to human health due to their
   potential presence in drinking waters. However, the following 14 PhACs
   should be prioritized for further study: triiodothyronine, thyroxine,
   ramipril and its metabolite ramiprilat, candesartan, lisinopril,
   atorvastatin, lorazepam, fentanyl, atenolol, metformin, enalaprilat,
   morphine, and irbesartan. Finally, the currently available monitoring
   data for PhACs in Canadian surface and drinking waters was found to be
   lacking, irrespective of whether their suitability was assessed based on
   risk posed, predicted exposure concentrations, or potency.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to make vaccines against infectious diseases and immunotherapies
   for cancer have evolved to utilize a variety of heterologous expression
   systems such as viral vectors. These vectors are often attenuated or
   engineered to safely deliver genes encoding antigens of different
   pathogens. Adenovirus and poxvirus vectors are among the viral vectors
   that are most frequently used to develop prophylactic vaccines against
   infectious diseases as well as therapeutic cancer vaccines. This
   mini-review describes the trends and processes in large-scale production
   of adenovirus and poxvirus vectors to meet the needs of clinical
   applications. We briefly describe the general principles for the
   production and purification of adenovirus and poxvirus viral vectors.
   Currently, adenovirus and poxvirus vector manufacturing methods rely on
   well-established cell culture technologies. Several improvements have
   been evaluated to increase the yield and to reduce the overall
   manufacturing cost, such as cultivation at high cell densities and
   continuous downstream processing. Additionally, advancements in vector

Abstract = {{To increase the number of successful accesses for machine-to-machine
   (M2M) communication, we propose a new random access (RA) procedure. The
   proposed RA procedure allows evolved NodeB (eNB) to know the preamble
   collisions in the first step by attaching user equipment (UE) identity
   information in physical random access channel (PRACH). This improvement
   prevents eNB from scheduling physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) to
   the collided preambles, which improves the resource efficiency. Based on
   the enhanced RA procedure, a resource allocation scheme is proposed. By
   estimating the number of successful preamble, the proposed scheme
   achieves a reasonable resource tradeoff between PRACH and PUSCH.
   Simulation results show that the proposed RA procedure significantly
   improves the number of successful accesses as well as the resource
   efficiency.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Retted flax stems contained high amounts of water from the pre-soaking
   and retting processes. Electro-osmotic dewatering was investigated as a
   pre-drying process for high-moisture flax stems using a bench
   electro-osmotic roller press. The various parameters affecting
   electroosmotic dewatering were cylinder pressure (1000 kPa-3000 kPa),
   applied voltage (12 V-36 V) and pre-soaking time of the flax stem (12
   h-36 h). An experiment was designed using central composite design. From
   the experiments, a maximum of 38.34\% of the total water contained in
   the stem was removed using 12 h soaking; 1000 kPa cylinder pressure and
   36 V applied voltage during the electro-osmotic treatment. For a given
   soaking time, at 36 V with 3000 kPa cylinder pressure the maximum water
   removal occurred. The electro-osmotic permeability of the stems at
   various conditions was studied. In all the treatments, electro-osmotic
   permeability ranged between 3.32 x 10(-5) m(2) V-1 s(-1) and 1.22 x
   10(-4) m(2) V-1 s(-1). Electro-osmotic permeability was found to
   increase with increasing water removal and decreased with increasing
   applied voltage. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Copper adsorption was carried out using the novel material known as
   air-filled emulsion (AFE). AFE is a stable colloidal system containing
   microscopic protein-coated bubbles (<10 pm) dispersed through an aqueous
   solution, resulting in an increased specific surface area and contact
   time between extractant and metal ions. Bovine serum albumen (BSA)
   generated emulsion concentration had a significant impact on copper
   removal, with maximum metal uptake obtained at 2.5 g/l of BSA-coated
   bubbles. It was shown that copper sorption was rapid over the first 10
   min, and equilibrium conditions were reached within 40 min. Separation
   of the copper-loaded microcells from the aqueous solution was also
   investigated. Micro-flotation was employed to remove the microbubbles by
   means of attachment to the surface of larger air bubbles. In absence of
   a cationic surfactant, approximately 0.5\% copper recovery was obtained
   at pH ranging from 5 to 8 due to the lack of hydrophobic groups on the
   surface of Cu-loaded BSA emulsions. Due to the fine sizes of the
   emulsion bubbles (<10 mu m) a cationic flocculant was used to induce
   coagulation of the bubbles leading to easier phase separation. A
   combination of collector and flocculant at a concentration of 3 x 10(-4)
   M and 0.025 g/l, respectively, led to an increase in copper recovery to
   nearly 35\% at pH 7. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Bounded trajectories of a spacecraft near an equilibrium point of a
   binary asteroid system}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{313-323}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{With a growing interest in asteroid exploration, combined with the fact
   that numerous asteroids in nature occur in pairs, it is likely that
   future missions will include the exploration of binary asteroid systems.
   Thus, it is useful to study the motion of a spacecraft in the vicinity
   of such systems, modeled as the three-body problem. In this paper, the
   circular restricted full three-body problem is considered. The
   zeroth-order equations of motion near an equilibrium point are similar
   in form to those in the classical case with point-masses or spherical
   primaries. For most asteroid pairs found in practice, all five
   equilibrium points are unstable. However, with selection of appropriate
   initial conditions, it is possible to obtain bounded solutions to the
   zeroth-order equations, corresponding to the Lissajous trajectories near
   collinear points, and bounded trajectories near noncollinear points.
   Numerical simulations confirm that when including the additional
   perturbations due to the asphericity of the asteroid pair, the motion of
   the spacecraft is unbounded. Thus, control laws are developed by
   utilizing an appropriate Lyapunov function, with the solutions to the
   zeroth-order equations as reference trajectories. These were found to be
   sufficient to maintain the spacecraft in bounded trajectories. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Pulsating impinging jets can have significant influence on transfer
   processes. A number of studies have been done on heat transfer in a
   pulsating impinging jet but very divergent and sometimes contradictory
   results have been reported. In the present study, the flow and
   temperature field under a single confined pulsating turbulent impinging
   jet are determined numerically by the finite volume method. Effects of
   Pulsation function parameters (frequency and amplitude) and various
   geometries on the flow characteristics and heat transfer rate from hot
   surface are discussed. Results of simulation show that flow pulsation
   has different effects in various flow zones. Pulsation of jet improve
   cooling performance in the wall jet zone and simultaneously reduce heat
   transfer in the stagnation zone. As expected the effect of flow
   pulsation decays with distance from the jet nozzle. Under certain
   conditions flow oscillation adversely affects the heat transfer in
   comparison with the steady jet at the same mean Reynolds number. In
   pulsating jets we can introduce a critical frequency correspond to
   St=0.26. The amount of heat transfer at the frequencies corresponding
   St=0.26 is higher than other cases. In general, it is concluded that
   cooling performance of oscillating impinging jet is enhanced by increase
   in the frequency and amplitude of oscillation as well as decrease in
   nozzle to plate distance.}},

   Regional Intensity Variability and Local Neighborhood Information}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Goal: In this paper, a fully automatic probabilistic method for multiple
   sclerosis (MS) lesion classification is presented, whereby the posterior
   probability density function over healthy tissues and two types of
   lesions (T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense) is generated at every
   voxel. Methods: During training, the system explicitly models the
   spatial variability of the intensity distributions throughout the brain
   by first segmenting it into distinct anatomical regions and then
   building regional likelihood distributions for each tissue class based
   on multimodal magnetic resonance image (MRI) intensities. Local class
   smoothness is ensured by incorporating neighboring voxel information in
   the prior probability through Markov random fields. The system is tested
   on two datasets from real multisite clinical trials consisting of
   multimodal MRIs from a total of 100 patients with MS. Lesion
   classification results based on the framework are compared with and
   without the regional information, as well as with other state-of-the-art
   methods against the labels from expert manual raters. The metrics for
   comparison include Dice overlap, sensitivity, and positive predictive
   rates for both voxel and lesion classifications. Results: Statistically
   significant improvements in Dice values (p < 0.01), for voxel-based and
   lesion-based sensitivity values (p < 0.001), and positive predictive
   rates (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 respectively) are shown when the proposed
   method is compared to the method without regional information, and to a
   widely used method {[}1]. This holds particularly true in the posterior
   fossa, an area where classification is very challenging. Significance:
   The proposed method allows us to provide clinicians with accurate tissue
   labels for T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense lesions, two types of
   lesions that differ in appearance and clinical ramifications, and with a
   confidence level in the classification, which helps clinicians assess
   the classification results.}},

   optical coherence tomography (OCT) has emerged as a promising tool,

   resulting from cellular viability and motility allows for the
   distinction of live cells from their surrounding scaffold environment.
   Motility imaging was performed via a common-path optical coherence phase
   microscope (OCPM), an OCT modality that has been shown to be sensitive
   to nanometer-level fluctuations. More specifically, we examined the
   development of human adipose-derived stem cells and/or murine
   pre-osteoblasts within two distinct scaffold systems, commercially
   available alginate sponges and custom-microfabricated poly(d,
   l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) fibrous scaffolds. Cellular motility is
   demonstrated as an endogenous source of contrast for OCPM, enabling
   real-time, label-free monitoring of 3D engineered tissue development.

Abstract = {{The 6x6 Cartesian stiffness matrix obtained through finite element
   analysis for compliant mechanical structures may lead to spurious
   coupling that stems from discretization error. The coupling may lead, in
   turn, to inaccurate results of the translational and rotational
   displacement analysis of the structure, for which reason a reliable
   decoupling technique becomes essential. In this paper, the authors
   resort to a decoupling technique of the Cartesian stiffness matrix,
   reported elsewhere, which is applied to the stiffness matrix of a class
   of accelerometers. In doing this, the generalized eigenvalue problem is
   first recalled as a powerful tool that is pertinent to the design task
   at hand (Ding and Selig in Int. J. Mech. Sci. 46(5): 703-727, 2004). The
   decoupled submatrices are then investigated by means of eigenvalue
   analysis. As a consequence, the translational and rotational stiffness
   matrices can be analyzed independently. Meanwhile, the decoupled
   stiffness matrices reveal compliance along the sensitive axes and high
   off-axis stiffness, thereby satisfying the ultimate design objectives
   for microaccelerometers with isotropic, monolithic structure.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundRates of extubation failure of extremely preterm infants
   remain high. Analysis of breathing patterns variability during
   spontaneous breathing under endotracheal tube continuous positive airway
   pressure (ETT-CPAP) is a potential tool to predict extubation readiness.
   ObjectiveTo investigate if automated analysis of respiratory signals
   would reveal differences in respiratory behavior between infants that
   were successfully extubated or not.
   MethodsRespiratory Inductive Plethysmography (RIP) signals were recorded
   during ETT-CPAP just prior to extubation. Signals were digitized, and
   analyzed using an Automated Unsupervised Respiratory Event Analysis
   (AUREA). Extubation failure was defined as reintubation within 72 hr.
   Statistical differences between infants who were successfully extubated
   or failed were calculated.
   ResultsA total of 56 infants were enrolled and one was excluded due to
   instability during the ETT-CPAP; 11 out of 55 infants studied failed
   extubation (20\%). No differences in demographics were observed between
   the success and failure groups. Significant differences on the
   variability of some respiratory parameters or metrics' estimated by
   AUREA were observed between the 2 groups. Indeed, a simple
   classification using the variability of two metrics of respiratory
   behavior predicted extubation failure with high accuracy.
   ConclusionAutomated analysis of respiratory behavior during a short
   ETT-CPAP period may help in the prediction of extubation readiness in
   extremely preterm infants. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015; 50:479-486. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{In order to supplement the need for alternative energy resources within

   immobilized Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB8052 was investigated.
   Magnetite nanoparticles were functionalized, with chitosan and alginic
   acid polyelectrolytes using a layer-by-layer method, to promote
   bacterial attachment. Cultivating C. beijerinckii with these
   nanoparticles resulted in a shorter lag growth phase and increased total
   biohydrogen production within 100-ml, 250-ml and 3.6-L reactors compared
   with freely suspended organisms. The greatest hydrogen yield was
   obtained in the 250-ml reactor with a value of 2.1 +/- 0.7 mol H-2/mol
   glucose, corresponding to substrate conversion and energy conversion
   efficiencies of 52 +/- 18 and 10 +/- 3 \%, respectively. The hydrogen
   yields obtained using the immobilized bacteria are comparable to values
   found in literature. However, to make this process viable, further
   improvements are required to increase the substrate and energy

Title = {{Quantitative comparison of 21 protocols for labeling hippocampal
   subfields and parahippocampal subregions in in vivo MRI: Towards a
   harmonized segmentation protocol}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{526-541}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Objective: An increasing number of human in vivo magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) studies have focused on examining the structure and
   function of the subfields of the hippocampal formation (the dentate
   gyrus, CA fields 1-3, and the subiculum) and subregions of the
   parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal
   cortices). The ability to interpret the results of such studies and to
   relate them to each other would be improved if a common standard existed
   for labeling hippocampal subfields and parahippocampal subregions.
   Currently, research groups label different subsets of structures and use
   different rules, landmarks, and cues to define their anatomical extents.
   This paper characterizes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the
   variability in the existing manual segmentation protocols for labeling
   hippocampal and parahippocampal substructures in MRI, with the goal of
   guiding subsequent work on developing a harmonized substructure
   segmentation protocol.
   Method: MRI scans of a single healthy adult human subject were acquired
   both at 3 T and 7 T. Representatives from 21 research groups applied
   their respective manual segmentation protocols to the MRI modalities of
   their choice. The resulting set of 21 segmentations was analyzed in a
   common anatomical space to quantify similarity and identify areas of
   agreement.
   Results: The differences between the 21 protocols include the region
   within which segmentation is performed, the set of anatomical labels
   used, and the extents of specific anatomical labels. The greatest
   overall disagreement among the protocols is at the CA1/subiculum
   boundary, and disagreement across all structures is greatest in the
   anterior portion of the hippocampal formation relative to the body and
   tail.
   Conclusions: The combined examination of the 21 protocols in the same
   dataset suggests possible strategies towards developing a harmonized
   subfield segmentation protocol and facilitates comparison between
   published studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The thermo-mechanical nonlinear dynamics of a three-dimensional axially
   moving beam is examined numerically in this paper. Hamilton's principle
   is employed to derive the nonlinear partial differential equations
   governing the motion of the system in the longitudinal, transverse, and
   lateral directions. The discretized equations of motion, which are in
   the form of second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations, are
   obtained by applying the Galerkin technique to the nonlinear partial
   differential equations of motion. A change of variables is introduced to
   this set of equations, yielding a set of first-order nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations. The pseudo-arclength continuation technique is
   employed to solve this set of equations numerically so as to construct
   the frequency-response curves; this method allows continuation of both
   stable and unstable solution branches. The effect of modal interactions
   on the resonant dynamic behaviour of a fully symmetrical system (about
   the centreline) is also examined.}},

Pages = {{293-304}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The Mach reflection of a ZND detonation wave on a wedge is investigated
   numerically. A two-step chain-branching reaction model is used giving a
   thermally neutral induction zone followed by a chemical reaction zone
   for the detonation wave. The presence of a finite reaction zone
   thickness renders the Mach reflection process non-self-similar. The
   variation of the height of the Mach stem with distance of propagation
   does not correspond to a straight curve from the wedge apex as governed
   by self-similar three-shock theory. However, the present results
   indicate that in the near field around the wedge apex, and in the far
   field where the reaction zone thickness is small compared to the
   distance of travel of the Mach stem, the behavior appears to be
   self-similar. This corresponds to the so-called frozen and equilibrium
   limit pointed out by Hornung and Sanderman for strong discontinuity
   shock waves and by Shepherd et al. for cellular detonations. The
   critical wedge angle for the transition from regular to Mach reflection
   is found to correspond to the value determined by self-similar
   three-shock theory, but not by reactive three-shock theory for a
   discontinuous detonation front.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{219-227}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Miniature pressure sensors were embedded into the honeycomb core of
   sandwich panels featuring both tool-side and bag-side skins. The
   pressure response was measured throughout the vacuum hold and elevated
   temperature processing stages of both oven and autoclave manufacturing.
   The elevated temperature processing measurements validated the honeycomb
   core pressure model presented in Part I, confirming that gas flow
   primarily occurs through the bag-side skin in semi-infinite panels.
   Aramid core panels showed much higher honeycomb core pressures than
   aluminum cores during elevated temperature processing. Higher core
   pressures during processing led to more gas flow and as a result, cured
   skins with interconnected porosity. The best sealed aramid core
   honeycomb skins were processed under one atmosphere of positive pressure
   with a vented vacuum bag, avoiding the continuous extraction of gas
   through the skins by the vacuum pump while the resin was highly mobile.

Abstract = {{A process model was developed for the honeycomb core pressure during
   sandwich panel manufacturing. The model predicted the inflow of moisture
   from the cell walls into the cell void space using by Fick's law, and
   the outflow of moist air through the bag-side skin was governed by
   Darcy's law. The model required the core moisture content and honeycomb
   skin through-thickness air permeability to be experimentally measured. A
   partially saturated out-of-autoclave woven prepreg was used as the skin
   material in this study. In-order to accurately apply Darcy's law during
   elevated temperature processing, an incremental temperature measurement
   technique was proposed to maintain constant skin thickness during air
   permeability characterization. Micro-CT imaging was performed on cure
   quenched samples to confirm that the proposed characterization technique
   maintained the impregnation dynamics of the target cure cycle. Model
   predictions using the characterized material properties are compared to
   in-situ core pressure measurements in Part II. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A Multibody Dynamics Framework for Simulation of Rovers on Soft Terrain}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A new framework is developed for efficient implementation of
   semi-empirical terramechanics models in multibody dynamics environments.
   In this approach, for every wheel in contact with soft soil, unilateral
   contact constraints are added for both the normal direction and the
   tangent plane. The forces associated with the latter, like traction and
   rolling resistance, are formulated in this approach as set-valued force
   laws, their properties being determined by deregularization of the
   terramechanics relations. As shown in the paper, this leads to the
   dynamics representation in the form of a linear complementarity problem
   (LCP). With this formulation, stable simulation of rovers is achieved
   even at relatively large time steps. In addition, a high-resolution
   height-field (HF) is employed to model terrain-surface deformation and
   changes in hardening of soil under the wheel. As a result, the multipass
   effect is captured in the presented approach. In addition, an extensive
   set of experiments was conducted using a version of the Juno rover (Juno
   II). The experimental results are analyzed and compared with the model
   developed in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Non-edible feedstocks such as animal fat wastes (AFWs) have recently
   increased in popularity as alternatives to vegetable oils in the
   production of biodiesel. They are low cost, mitigate environmental
   damage and increase the quality of the resultant biodiesel fuel (low NOx
   emissions, high Cetane number and oxidative stability). Therefore, AFWs
   are an excellent feedstock for biodiesel production. Here we provide a
   comprehensive review trends and techniques in biodiesel production from
   AFWs. A critical overview of homogeneous and heterogeneous (one- or
   two-step) catalytic transesterification of AFWs is presented. Similarly,
   enzyme-catalyzed transesterification and the application of
   supercritical fluids conversion techniques in the production of
   biodiesel from AFWs are thoroughly assessed. Finally, cutting edge
   advances in assisted transesterification processes for biodiesel
   production are critically reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a hydrophobic, biodegradable biopolymer,
   which can be a potential substitute for currently used synthesized
   polymers in the packaging industry. However, its utility is often
   limited by its brittleness and poor mechanical properties, mainly
   because of its through-thickness fractures. In this study, we laminate
   and crystallize PHB on glassine paper by hot-pressing and tune the
   crystallization conditions to minimize cracking. Glassine paper is
   impermeable to PHB granules and allows the formation of a
   distinguishable bilayer of PHB. It was found that glassine paper serves
   as a soft substrate, which increases the number of nucleation sites of
   the spherulites and prevents growth of the cracks in the neighboring PHB
   layer. Quenching the films to the crystallization temperature was found
   to minimize cracking enough to reduce the water vapor transmission rate
   to -, irrespective of the crystallization temperature; however, the
   mechanical properties improved only at the crystallization temperatures
   below 77 A degrees C, perhaps due to the local stress in the existing
   cracks at higher crystallization temperatures. The optimum
   crystallization conditions were found to be quenching the film in an ice
   bath and crystallization at room temperature, by which we obtained
   mechanical strength and Young's modulus of and , respectively, and a
   water vapor transmission rate of . Our results suggest a simple and
   cost-effective method to produce PHB films with enhanced mechanical and
   barrier properties.}},

Abstract = {{Metal sulfides are widely used in a variety of applications requiring
   high hardness and toughness. In this study, the microstructure and
   mechanical properties of chromium-chromium sulfide cermets are
   investigated. The chromium-chromium sulfide cermet was manufactured
   using self-propagating high-temperature synthesis, a process where the
   material is created under a self-sustaining combustion reaction between
   the chromium and sulfur. This type of synthesis allows the creation of
   near-net shape structures and offers the possibility of tuning material
   properties and material behavior by changing the composition of the
   reactant. Microstructural characterization was performed using optical
   microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive
   spectroscopy. The mechanical properties of the cermet (Young's modulus,
   fracture toughness, flexural strength, and microhardness) have been
   measured and related to morphology and chemical composition of the
   samples. Results show that dense cermets (about 7 \% porosity) with
   specific structure have been obtained. Pure CrS has a significant
   hardness, but its toughness was insufficient for tool applications.
   However, we found that the density and fracture toughness of the cermets
   increase with the addition of Cr. The addition of Cr also improved the
   flexural strength and hardness of the cermet by 60 \% and almost 38 \%,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Irregularities and microstructure of the surface of batter coatings play
   a critical role in oil uptake during deep-fat frying of coated products.
   The objective of this study was to study the influence of batter
   formulations on surface irregularities of fried batters. Variable
   pressure scanning electron microscopy (VP-SEM) was used to study the
   surface microstructure of batters prepared using different combinations
   of wheat and rice flours. Images of batter surfaces were captured, and
   characterized using parameters such as the total number, mean area, the
   biggest area, ratio and roundness of the generated ruptures on the
   coating surface after frying. The total number of generated ruptures on
   the surface of fried batters was significantly (P < 0.05) influenced by
   the batter coating formulation. Batters formulated only with wheat flour
   showed the highest number whereas batters formulated only with rice
   flour showed the least number of holes and cracks. Roundness of the
   ruptures ranged from 0.19 to 0.35. The higher amount of rice flour used
   in the formulation of batter, the higher the area of generated holes and
   cracks on surface was observed. Fat content was directly correlated with
   the ratio of the observed holes and cracks generated on the surface
   (vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.72), whereas moisture loss was
   correlated with ratio (vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.67) and mean area
   (vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.77). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We address the class masking problem in multiclass linear discriminant
   analysis (LDA). In the multiclass setting, LDA does not maximize each
   pairwise distance between classes, but rather maximizes the sum of all
   pairwise distances. This results in serious overlaps between classes
   that are close to each other in the input space, and degrades
   classification performance. Our research proposes Pareto Discriminant
   Analysis (PARDA); an approach for multiclass discriminative analysis
   that builds over multiobjective optimizing models. PARDA decomposes the
   multiclass problem to a set of objective functions, each representing
   the distance between every pair of classes. Unlike existing LDA
   extensions that maximize the sum of all distances, PARDA maximizes each
   pairwise distance to maximally separate all class means, while
   minimizing the class overlap in the lower dimensional space.
   Experimental results on various data sets show consistent and promising
   performance of PARDA when compared with well-known multiclass LDA
   extensions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The active vibration control of a free rectangular sandwich plate by
   using the Positive Position Feedback (PPF) algorithm was experimentally
   investigated in a previous study. Four normal modes were controlled by
   four nearly collocated couples of piezoelectric sensors and actuators.
   The experimental results of the control showed some limitation,
   especially in the Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) configuration. This
   was attributed to the specific type of sensors and their conditioning,
   as well as to the phase shifts present in the vibration at different
   points of the structure. An alternative approach is here undertaken by
   abandoning the configuration of quasi-perfect collocation between sensor
   and actuator The positioning of the piezoelectric patches is still led
   by the strain energy value distribution on the plate; each couple of
   sensor and actuator is now placed on the same face of the plate but in
   two distinct positions, opposed and symmetrical with respect to the
   geometric center of the plate. Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) PPE is
   tested and the transfer function parameters of the controller are tuned
   according to the measured values of modal clamping. Then the
   participation matrices necessary for the MIMO control algorithm are
   determined by means of a completely experimental procedure. PPF is able
   to mitigate the vibration of the first four natural modes, in spite of
   the rigid body motions due to the free boundary conditions. The
   amplitude reduction achieved with the non-collocated configuration is
   much larger than the one obtained with the nearby collocated one. The
   phase lags were addressed in the MIMO algorithm by correction phase
   delays, further increasing the performance of the controller. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{How disease-associated mutations impair protein activities in the
   context of biological networks remains mostly undetermined. Although a
   few renowned alleles are well characterized, functional information is
   missing for over 100,000 disease-associated variants. Here we
   functionally profile several thousand missense mutations across a
   spectrum of Mendelian disorders using various interaction assays. The
   majority of disease-associated alleles exhibit wild-type chaperone
   binding profiles, suggesting they preserve protein folding or stability.
   While common variants from healthy individuals rarely affect
   interactions, two-thirds of disease-associated alleles perturb
   protein-protein interactions, with half corresponding to ``edgetic{''}
   alleles affecting only a subset of interactions while leaving most other
   interactions unperturbed. With transcription factors, many alleles that
   leave protein-protein interactions intact affect DNA binding. Different
   mutations in the same gene leading to different interaction profiles
   often result in distinct disease phenotypes. Thus disease-associated
   alleles that perturb distinct protein activities rather than grossly
   affecting folding and stability are relatively widespread.}},

Abstract = {{A method for the incorporation of immobile oxygen-containing functional
   groups onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) rooted in a metallic
   substrate for supercapacitor (SC) application is presented. Direct
   growth on the current collector (a 316 stainless steel (SS) mesh) offers
   the benefit of minimal MWCNT agglomeration, avoidance of using binder,
   and maintaining the 3-dimensional nanostructure. MWCNTs are grown by
   thermal-chemical vapour deposition (t-CVD) using SS as substrate and
   functionalized using an Ar/C2H6/O-2 glow discharge. When used as a
   binder-free SC electrode, these functionalized MWCNTs (f-MWCNTs) show
   excellent surface stability and large specific capacitance values. At
   low charging/discharging current densities (0.2 mA cm (-2) or 3 A g
   (-1)), a specific capacitance of 288 +/- 10 F g (-1) is achieved. The
   material shows good rate capability up to charging/discharging current
   density of 10 mA cm (-2) (37 A g (-1)) and displays excellent
   reversibility. Consequently, these new binder-free f-MWCNT SC electrodes
   are excellent candidates for future investigations of MWCNT-based SC
   electrodes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Tailoring the mechanical and tribological properties of sputtered boron

Journal = {{SURFACE \& COATINGS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{267}},
Pages = {{2-7}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Boron carbide films are very attractive due to their high hardness and
   interesting tribological properties. In the present work, the
   compositional effect of boron carbide B1 - xCx (0 < x < 1) films is
   systematically studied to tailor mechanical, tribological and corrosion
   properties of the films. The B1 - xCx layers were deposited on Si (100)
   and M2 high speed steel substrates using a pilot-scale closed-field
   unbalanced magnetron sputtering system equipped with one graphite and
   two boron targets. Different compositions were obtained by tuning the
   electrical power applied to the graphite target. The hardness of the B1
   - xCx films decreases from 28 to 20 GPa as the carbon content {[}C]
   rises from 19 to 56 at.\%, but thereafter it increases again up to -25
   GPa when {[}C] reaches 76 at.\%. The hardness variation is explained by
   changes in the film microstructure, namely formation of either a
   nanoaystalline boron carbide in the case of boron-rich films, or boron
   carbide nanocrystals dispersed in an amorphous boron carbide/a-C matrix
   in the case of carbon-rich films as deduced from the combined XPS,
   micro-Raman and XRD measurements. The friction coefficient of the B1 -
   xCx films reduces from 0.66 to 0.13, and the wear rate against alumina
   ball drops from 6.4 x 10(-5) mm(3)/Nm to 13 x 10(-7) mm(3)/Nm with
   increasing the {[}C]. Raman analyses indicate that improvement of the
   tribological properties of the B1 - xCx films is primarily caused by the
   presence of the amorphous carbon phase that leads to the formation of a
   graphitic tribolayer acting as a solid lubricant during the wear
   process. Deposition of the B0.81C0.19 film with high hardness (28 GPa)
   improves the corrosion resistance of the M2 steel substrate by four
   orders of magnitude, documented by the decrease of the corrosion current
   from 3 x 10(-6) A/cm(2) to 8 x 10(-10) A/cm(2). We demonstrate that
   adjustment of the x-portion in the B1 - xCx system allows one to tailor
   the tribo-mechanical properties over a large range from high
   hardness/high friction to high hardness/low friction structures. (C)

   perform below the bit error rate forward error correction threshold of
   3.8 x 10(-3), with a worst case power penalty of 8 dB. We compare our
   wavelength multicasting performance against the theoretical power
   transfer during a three-wave mixing process and show that the average
   power of degenerate idlers agrees with the predicted 6 dB difference
   with respect to that of nondegenerate idlers. When distinguishing the
   nonlinear conversion efficiency from the absolute idlers power at the
   output of the silicon nanowire, we also show the importance of the
   output grating coupler's loss and how it impacts the multicasting
   performance, in conjunction with the four-wave mixing efficiency.}},

   Addressing inequitable practices in Participatory Model Building}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{153-162}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Within the field of water resource management, Group Model Building
   (GMB) is a growing method used to engage stakeholders in the development
   of models that describe environmental and socioeconomic systems to
   create and test policy alternatives. While there is significant focus on
   improving stakeholder engagement, there is a lack of studies
   specifically looking at the experiences of marginalized communities and
   the barriers that prevent their fuller participation in the
   decision-malcing process. This paper explores the common issues and
   presents recommended improved practices, based on anti-oppression,
   related to the stages of problem framing, stakeholder identification and
   selection, workshop preparation, and workshop facilitation. For problem
   defining and stakeholder selection, the major recommendations are to
   engage diverse stakeholder communities from the earliest stages and give
   them control over framing the project scope. With regards to planning
   the model building workshops, it is recommended that the facilitation
   team work closely with marginalized stakeholders to highlight and
   address barriers that would prevent their inclusion. With the actual
   facilitation of the workshops, it is best to employ activities that
   allow stakeholders to provide knowledge and input in mediums that are
   most comfortable to them; additionally, the facilitation team needs to
   be able to challenge problematic interpersonal interactions as they
   manifest within conversations. This article focuses on building
   comfortability with political language so that the systemic oppression
   in which existing participatory processes occur can be understood, thus
   allowing GMB practitioners to engage in social justice efforts. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The planning phase of every construction project is entangled with
   multiple and occasionally conflicting criteria which need to be
   optimized simultaneously. Multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM)
   approaches can aid decision-makers in selecting the most appropriate
   solution among numerous potential Pareto optimal solutions. An
   evidential reasoning (ER) approach was applied for the first time in the
   context of project scheduling to identify the best Pareto solution for
   discrete time-cost-quality trade-off problems (DTCQTPs). An exhaustive
   framework to synthesize the MCDM approaches with multi-objective
   optimization techniques was also proposed. To identify all global Pareto
   optimal solutions, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA)
   incorporating the NSGA-II procedure was developed and tested in a
   highway construction project case study. The Shannon's entropy technique
   served to determine the relative weights of the objectives according to
   their contributions to the uncertainty of the results obtained. A
   benchmark case study of DTCQTP was solved using the proposed
   methodology, and the Pareto optimal solutions obtained were subsequently
   ranked using the ER approach. By investigating the performance of each
   scheduling alternative based on multiple criteria (e.g., time, cost, and
   quality), the proposed approach proved effective in raising the
   efficiently of construction project scheduling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, the in vitro digestibility of lectin from black turtle
   bean was investigated in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and tryptic
   digestion, using kinetic densitometric analysis for SDS PAGE and
   spectroscopic measurements. It was found that the native lectin was
   relatively stable in both SGF (half-life = 22.71 mm) and tryptic
   digestion (half-life >= 90 min), the susceptibility of the protein to
   hydrolysis by proteases was markedly increased by preheating and also
   enhanced by demetallization. An unfolding state of the preheated lectin
   was observed by UV and fluorescence spectroscopy, although the
   conformational changes were found to be limited by the demetallization.
   This study provides evidence that metal ions may provide resistance
   during protease hydrolysis, and suggests both preheating and
   demetallization contribute to in vitro proteolytic degradation of
   lectin. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{New insights into the effect of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) concentration

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{126}},

Abstract = {{Kinetic hydrate inhibition studies generally characterize the effect of
   inhibitors on the crystal phase during formation and growth conditions.
   However, little work has been conducted to investigate the influence of
   the inhibitors on the gas hydrate former in kinetically inhibited
   systems. The current study examines the effect of polyvinylpyrrolidone
   (PVP) on methane mole fraction in the bulk liquid phase during growth.
   Hydrates were formed in an isothermal/isobaric semi batch stirred
   crystallizer maintained at 275.1 K and 5645 kPa that contained aqueous
   solutions of 0-0.07 wt\% PVP. Mole fraction measurements were taken from
   liquid samples extracted at 450 s and 900 s after the start of hydrate
   growth. Results indicated that while PVP had a negligible effect on
   methane solubility, the degree of supersaturation was significantly
   enhanced with inhibitor loading. The increase in supersaturation was
   attributed predominantly to a reduced surface area available for
   enclathration of methane into the hydrate lattice due to PVP binding.
   Correlation of mole fraction results to growth rate data through a
   kinetic model further pointed to a significant decrease in the total
   surface area available for reaction as a function of inhibitor loading.

Abstract = {{To further understand the effects of polyvinylpyrrolidone (EVE) on
   methane hydrate growth, the current study evaluates initial hydrate
   growth rate over a wide range of EVE concentrations from 0.7 to 20 000
   ppmw (2 wt\%) in a stirred Lank crystallizer. Tests were undertaken at
   temperatures ranging from 275.1 to 279.1 K, pressures from 4645 to 7183
   kPa and EVE molecular weights of 10 000, 40 000 and 360 000 g/mol.
   Throughout all these conditions, a common sigmoidal trend between growth
   rate and EVE concentration was observed. Initial growth rates were the
   same as that of pure water at EVE concentrations under 10 ppmw but
   decreased rapidly to near zero growth at concentrations above 1000 ppmw.
   EVE reduced the initial growth rate by roughly 50\% over the
   concentration range of 10 to 100 ppmw. Such low concentrations have not
   previously been investigated and provide insight into the EVE inhibition
   mechanism. EVE was shown to be less effective at inhibiting hydrate
   growth as reactor pressure increased. The various molecular weights
   investigated showed similar effects on growth rate at the same mass
   concentrations, showing no improvement in inhibition by varying polymer
   chain length over the range tested. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The highly complex structure of the human brain is strongly shaped by
   genetic influences(1). Subcortical brain regions form circuits with
   cortical areas to coordinate movement(2), learning, memory(3) and
   motivation(4), and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and
   disease(5). To investigate how common genetic variants affect the
   structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide
   association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the
   intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717
   individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants
   influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find
   stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences
   on hippocampal volume(5) and intracranial volume(6). These variants show
   specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global
   effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the
   putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on
   volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 X 10(-33); 0.52\% variance explained) showed
   evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and
   blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near
   developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle
   transport. Identification of these genetic variants provides insight
   into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help
   to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{We present analysis, scaling and modelling based on a previously
   presented nonlinear nonlocal nematic elastica equation of disclination
   loop growth in nematic liquid crystals confined to conical geometries
   with homeotropic anchoring conditions. The +1/2 disclination loops arise
   during the well-known planar radial to planar polar texture
   transformation and are attached to +1 singular core disclination at two
   branch points. The shape of the +1/2 loops is controlled by the axial
   speed of the branch points and the bending stiffness of the disclination
   both of which being affected by the confinement gradients (reduction in
   cross-sectional area) of a conical geometry. Motion towards the cone
   apex results in faster branch point motions and weaker curvature
   changes, but motion away from the apex results in slower branch point
   motion and stronger curvature changes. The simultaneous action of these
   effects results in novel ovoidal disclination loops. The numerical
   results are condensed into useful power laws and integrated into a
   shape/energy analysis that reveals the effects of confinement and its
   gradient on ovoidal disclination loops. These new findings are useful to
   characterise the Frank elasticity of new nematic mesophases and to
   predict novel defect structures under complex confinement.}},

Abstract = {{Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most important drugs for breast cancer;
   however, the drug effects are limited by its systematic toxicity and
   poor water solubility. Nanoparticles have been applied for delivery of
   cancer drugs to overcome their limitations. Toward this goal, a novel
   single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)-based drug delivery system was
   developed by conjugation of human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles for
   loading of antitumor agent PTX. The nanosized macromolecular SWNT-drug
   carrier (SWNT-HSA) was characterized by TEM, UV-Vis-NIR spectrometry,
   and TGA. The SWNT-based drug carrier displayed high intracellular
   delivery efficiency (cell uptake rate of 80 \%) in breast cancer MCF-7
   cells, as examined by fluorescence-labeled drug carriers, suggesting the
   needle-shaped SWNT-HSA drug carrier was able to transport drugs across
   cell membrane despite its macromolecular structure. The drug loading on
   SWNT-based drug carrier was through high binding affinity of PTX to HSA
   proteins. The PTX formulated with SWNT-HSA showed greater growth
   inhibition activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells than PTX formulated
   with HSA nanoparticle only (cell viability of 63 vs 70 \% in 48 h and 53
   vs 62 \% in 72 h). The increased drug efficacy could be driven by
   SWNT-mediated cell internalization. These data suggest that the
   developed SWNT-based antitumor agent is functional and effective.
   However, more studies for in vivo drug delivery efficacy and other
   properties are needed before this delivery system can be fully realized.}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft sizing, route network design, demand estimation and allocation
   of aircraft to routes are different facets of the air transportation
   optimization problem that can be viewed as individual ``systems,{''}
   since they can be conducted independently. In fact, there is a large
   body of literature that investigates each of these as a stand-alone
   problem. In this regard, the air transportation design optimization
   problem can be viewed as an optimal system-of-systems (SoS) design
   problem. The resulting mixed variable programming problem may not be
   solvable using an all-in-one (AiO) approach because its size and
   complexity grow rapidly with increasing number of network nodes. In this
   work, we use a decomposition-based nested formulation and the Mesh
   Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) optimization algorithm to solve the
   optimal SoS design problem. The two-stage expansion of a regional
   Canadian airline's network to enable national operations is considered
   as a demonstrating example.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally the material of construction of many musical instruments
   has been limited to wood. The unique mechanical and acoustic properties
   of wood make it the material of choice for making musical instruments.
   In recent years, wood for musical instruments is depleting, becoming

   changes. This has resulted in most musical instrument builders searching
   for alternative materials to traditional musical instruments. This paper
   presents an important overview of recent research and developments and
   presents an initiative focusing on fibre reinforced composites as an
   alternative material for stringed instruments. Fibre composites are
   emerging as a competitive alternative material. Composite instruments
   has potential advantages for players concerned with functionality,

Abstract = {{Protein molecular motors, which convert, directly and efficiently,
   chemical energy into motion, are excellent candidates for integration in
   hybrid dynamic nanodevices. To integrate and use the full potential of
   molecular motors in these devices, their design requires a quantitative
   and precise prediction of the fundamental mechanical and physicochemical
   features of cytoskeletal proteins operating in artificial environments.
   In that regard, the behavior of protein molecular motors constructs
   in/on nano-confined spaces or nanostructured surfaces that aim to
   control their motility is of critical interest. Here, we used a standard
   gliding motility assay to study the actin filaments sliding on a surface
   comprising heavy mero myosin (HMM) micro- and nano-patterns. To print
   HMM, we used negative tone, micro contact printing of a blocking protein
   (bovine serum albumin, BSA) on a nitrocellulose surface, followed by
   specific adsorption of HMM on BSA-free surfaces. While the large
   BSA-free patterns allowed for selective confinement of actin filaments
   motility, the BSA-stamped areas displayed intricate nano-sized HMM
   patterns, which enabled a deeper analysis of the nano-mechanics of
   actomyosin motility in confined spaces.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The present paper deals with the nonlinear thermal instability of
   geometrically imperfect sandwich cylindrical shells under uniform
   heating. The sandwich shells are made of a shape memory alloy
   (SMA)-fiber-reinforced composite and functionally graded (FG) face
   sheets (FG/SMA/FG). The Brinson phenomenological model is used to
   express the constitutive characteristics of SMA fibers. The governing
   equations are established within the framework of the third-order shear
   deformation shell theory by taking into account the von Karman
   geometrical nonlinearity and initial imperfection. The material
   properties of constituents are assumed to be temperature dependent. The
   Galerkin technique is utilized to derive expressions of the bifurcation
   points and bifurcation paths of the sandwich cylindrical shells. Using
   the developed closed-form solutions, extensive numerical results are
   presented to provide an insight into the influence of the SMA fiber
   volume fraction, SMA pre-strain, core thickness, non-homogeneity index,
   geometrical imperfection, geometry parameters of sandwich shells and
   temperature dependency of materials on the stability of shells. The
   results reveal that proper application of SMA fibers postpones the
   thermal bifurcation point and dramatically decreases thermal
   post-buckling deflection. Moreover, the induced tensile recovery stress
   of SMA fibers could also stabilize the geometrically imperfect shells
   during the inverse martensite phase transformation.}},

Title = {{Analysing bicycle-sharing system user destination choice preferences:

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been increasing attention on bicycle-sharing
   systems (BSS) as a viable and sustainable mode of transportation for
   short trips. However, due to the relatively recent adoption of BSS,
   there is very little research exploring how people consider these
   systems within existing transportation options. Given recent BSS growth
   around the world, there is substantial interest in identifying
   contributing factors that encourage individuals to use these systems.
   The current study contributes to this growing literature by examining
   BSS behavior at the trip level to analyze bicyclists' destination
   preferences. Specifically, we study the decision process involved in
   identifying destination locations after picking up a bicycle at a BSS
   station, using a random utility maximization approach in the form of a
   multinomial logit model (MNL). The quantitative frameworks developed
   have been estimated using 2013 data from the Chicago's Divvy system. In
   our modeling effort, we distinguish between BSS users with annual
   membership and short-term customers with daily passes. The developed
   model should allow bicycle-sharing system operators to plan services
   more effectively by examining the impact of travel distance, land use,
   built environment, and access to public transportation infrastructure on
   users' destination preferences. Using the estimated model, we generated
   utility profiles as a function of distance and various other attributes,
   allowing us to represent visually the trade-offs that individuals make
   in the decision process. To illustrate further the applicability of the
   proposed framework for planning purposes, destination station-choice
   probability prediction is undertaken. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, energy consumption of intermittent drying of paddy rice
   is considered. Firstly, a mathematical model consists of two parts is
   established to describe the moisture distribution within a grain for
   both drying and tempering stages. The model, which is solved
   analytically, is proposed based on Fick's second law of diffusion within
   a sphere. Effects of different parameters namely air temperature and
   velocity are experimentally investigated utilizing a lab-scale fluidized
   bed dryer. Thereafter, moisture diffusivity is estimated in Arrhenius
   form using experimental results. Finally, the model is utilized in an
   optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption. Based on
   experimental results, impact of air velocity on drying characteristics
   is found to be negligible. The optimization results shows that employing
   the tempering stages substantially reduces the energy consumption. Not
   only that, it dictates a process beginning with longer drying stages and
   lower temperatures while the subsequent stages are shorter with higher
   temperatures. (C) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Solar water splitting for hydrogen generation can be a potential source
   of renewable energy for the future. Here we show that efficient and
   stable stoichiometric dissociation of water into hydrogen and oxygen can
   be achieved under visible light by eradicating the potential barrier on
   nonpolar surfaces of indium gallium nitride nanowires through controlled
   p-type dopant incorporation. An apparent quantum efficiency of similar
   to 12.3\% is achieved for overall neutral (pH similar to 7.0) water
   splitting under visible light illumination (400-475 nm). Moreover, using
   a double-band p-type gallium nitride/indium gallium nitride nanowire
   heterostructure, we show a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of
   similar to 1.8\% under concentrated sunlight. The dominant effect of
   near-surface band structure in transforming the photocatalytic
   performance is elucidated. The stability and efficiency of this
   recyclable, wafer-level nanoscale metal-nitride photocatalyst in neutral

Abstract = {{We present the design and fabrication of a single axis low noise

   wafer level vacuum encapsulation at 10 milliTorr which provides a high
   Quality factor and reduces noise interference on the MEMS sensor
   devices. The MIDIS process is based on high aspect ratio bulk
   micromachining of single-crystal silicon layer that is vacuum
   encapsulated between two other silicon handle wafers. The process
   includes sealed Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) for compact design and
   flip-chip integration with signal processing circuits. The proposed
   accelerometer design is sensitive to single-axis in-plane acceleration
   and uses a differential capacitance measurement. Over +/- 1 g
   measurement range, the measured sensitivity was 1fF/g. The accelerometer

Title = {{Calibrating RZWQM2 model using quantum-behaved particle swarm
   optimization algorithm}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{72-80}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The RZWQM2 model employs a number of parameters and coefficients
   requiring calibration and validation to accurately predict how
   interacting environmental conditions and management approaches influence
   crop development, water flow and pollutant levels in an agricultural
   production system. Given these requirements, an auto-calibration tool
   capable of optimizing RZWQM2 parameters would greatly enhance model
   efficiency over manual trial-and-error calibration. With a single
   parameter controlling convergence speed, the easy-to-implement
   quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm has
   performed well in deriving solutions to a wide range of optimization
   problems. Five years (2005-2009) of yield, drain flow, and NO3--N loss
   data from a subsurface-drained corn-soybean field in Iowa were employed
   in assessing the feasibility of using such an algorithm as an adjunct to
   RZWQM2. Using the QPSO algorithm, RZWQM2 parameters were calibrated
   using single- and multiple-objective functions. The algorithm-enhanced
   and standard models' performances in simulating yield, drainage, and
   NO3-N loss were compared on the basis of the percent bias (PBIAS),
   Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and the ratio of root mean
   squared error to standard error (RSR). With the QPSO algorithm the model
   calibration by individual parameter yielded PBIAS, NSE and RSR values of
   +/- 10\%, over 0.90, and less than 0.44, respectively, while for the
   collectively calibrated model values were +/- 12\%, over 0.83, and under
   0.41, comparable to the performance achieved through manual calibration.
   This study suggests that the models calibrated with the QPSO algorithm
   operated in a satisfactory manner, and this method can be used
   successfully in estimating parameters in RZWQM2. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Metallurgical processes have been traditionally taught as Extractive
   Metallurgy of various metals. Some 30 years ago the field of Process
   Metallurgy was advanced via the special attention given to the analysis

   paradigm has served well graduates from metallurgical engineering
   programs in countries with strong metals producing industries like
   Canada. Over the past 10-15 years, however we have witnessed the total
   transformation of metallurgy programs to materials science and
   engineering programs. Design and production of new advanced materials on
   the basis of processing-structure-property-performance relationships
   became the new paradigm. It is in this new context that teaching and
   research in extraction and processing is discussed in this article

Abstract = {{Gas hydrate inhibition is a prime focus of industrial hydrocarbon
   research as pipeline blockages can be costly and dangerous.
   Historically, many chemical species have been studied for their effects
   on the hydrate formation process. One of the most investigated compounds
   in the kinetic hydrate inhibitor (KHI) category is polyvinylpyrrolidone
   (PVP). While the effects of PVP on hydrates are well-documented, the
   mechanism that defines its function is still not completely understood.
   To obtain further insight into its behavior, bulk liquid samples in a
   PVP-containing system were extracted at six specific times throughout a
   methane hydrate formation process. The effect of PVP loading
   concentration was also investigated. It was found that as time
   progressed, concentration of PVP in the liquid decreased, suggesting
   that PVP binds to the surface of growing hydrates. Furthermore, this
   decrease in concentration was more prevalent in situations where lower
   initial PVP loadings were used.}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the outage performance of coherent partial decode-forward
   (pDF) relaying over Rayleigh fading channels in both half-and
   full-duplex transmissions. In coherent DF relaying, the relay either
   partially or fully decodes the source message, then coherently forwards
   the decoded message with the source to the destination. This coherent
   transmission creates a beamforming gain from the source and relay to the
   destination which improves the transmission rate. We analyze the impact
   of this beamforming gain on the outage performance, considering outage
   events at both the relay and the destination. We derive analytical
   expressions for the overall outage probability, assuming full CSI at
   receivers and only limited CSI at transmitters. We further show that at
   high SNR, coherent pDF relaying converges to full DF relaying and
   achieves the full diversity order of 2. These analyses provide a
   fundamental understanding of the reliability of coherent pDF relaying
   and form the basis for analyzing performance in larger network settings.
   Numerical results show that partial decoding at the relay outperforms
   full decoding for low SNR and high target rates in the half-duplex mode.
   Comparison with existing results further shows that source-relay
   coherent transmission and joint decoding at the destination both improve
   the outage performance.}},

Abstract = {{Highly mineralized biological materials such as nacre (mother of pearl),
   tooth enamel or conch shell boast unique and attractive combinations of
   stiffness, strength and toughness. The structures of these biological
   materials and their associated mechanisms are now inspiring new types of

   bottom up fabrication method could so far match biological materials in
   terms of microstructural organization and mechanical performance. Here
   we present a new `top down' strategy to tackling this fabrication
   problem, which consists in carving weak interfaces within a brittle
   material using a laser engraving technique. We demonstrate the method by
   fabricating and testing borosilicate glasses containing nacre-like
   microstructures infiltrated with polyurethane. When deformed, these
   materials properly duplicate the mechanisms of natural nacre:
   combination of controlled sliding of the tablets, accompanied with
   geometric hardening, strain hardening and strain rate hardening. The
   nacre-like glass is composed of 93 volume \% (vol\%) glass, yet 700
   times tougher and breaks at strains as high as 20\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the integration of channel decoding with fusion
   based decision, for coded collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) employing
   local Neyman-Pearson (NP) testing at each sensor. We derive a
   belief-propagation (BP) algorithm for joint channel decoding and
   decision fusion (JCDDF), based on a factor graph model for coded CSS
   schemes. Using the Lloyd-Max method, we also propose a new methodology
   for the local sensor to quantize its observation. The design of the
   quantizer embeds the binary NP test outcome in the quantization bits.
   Using the JCDDF algorithm, we show that coded CSS paired even with a
   short (8,4) extended Hamming code outperforms not only uncoded CSS, but
   also schemes where channel decoding and decision fusion are executed
   separately. Then, we consider the design of good channel codes for such
   CSS schemes. We demonstrate that the JCDDF algorithm employing unequal
   error protection (UEP) coding improves performance and outperforms equal
   error protection coding. Furthermore, we present a simple code search
   algorithm for identifying short UEP codes. Using such UEP codes, we
   finally show that a performance improvement over uncoded CSS can be
   attained also without bandwidth expansion using higher order
   modulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a single-or multi-user
   Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) Full-Duplex (FD) precoding
   transceiver structure applicable for single-carrier and Orthogonal
   Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The structure increases
   the dimensionality at the transmitter, which allow for the cancellation
   of self-interference and forward beamforming to be jointly processed
   using precoding at the transmitter. The FD Precoding (FDP) structure
   allows for various joint precoding algorithms and different optimization
   objectives. We present separate and joint precoding designs for sum-rate
   maximization and a theoretical analysis of when the separate design is
   optimal. The joint designs make use of Sequential Convex Programming
   (SCP). Extensive simulation results using both channel models and
   measured data show that the FDP structure can provide very significant
   performance gains over existing techniques for both SU- and MU-MIMO
   systems. In particular, the FDP structure provides between 1.6 and 1.8
   times the spectral efficiency of optimized half-duplex for many of the
   tested SU-MIMO scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Antibody microarrays can detect multiple proteins simultaneously, but
   the need for bulky and expensive fluorescence scanners limits their
   adaptation in clinical settings. Here we introduce a 15-plex
   enzyme-mediated silver enhanced sandwich immunoassay (SENSIA) on a
   microarray as an economic alternative to conventional fluorescence
   microarray assays. We compared several gold and silver amplification
   schemes, optimized HRP-mediated silver amplification, and evaluated the
   use of flatbed scanners for microarray quantification. Using the
   optimized assay condition, we established binding curves for 15 proteins
   using both SENSIA and conventional fluorescence microarray assays and
   compared their limits of detection (LODs) and dynamic ranges (DRs). We
   found that the LODs for all proteins are in the pg/mL range, with LODs
   for 12 proteins below 10 pg/mL. All but two proteins (ENDO and IL4) have
   similar LODs (less than 10-fold difference) and all but two proteins
   (IL1b and MCP1) are similar in DR (less than 1.5-log difference).
   Furthermore, we spiked six proteins in diluted serum and measured them
   by both silver enhancement and fluorescence detection and found a good
   agreement (R-2 > 0.9) between the two methods, suggesting that a complex
   matrix such as serum has a minimal effect on the measurement. By
   combining enzyme-mediated silver enhancement and consumer electronics
   for optical detection, SENSIA presents a new opportunity for low-cost
   high-sensitivity multiplex immunoassays for clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Injectable hydrogels are extensively used in drug delivery and tissue
   engineering to administer drugs, genes, growth factors and live cells.
   We report a method to produce tough, in-situ thermogelling, non-toxic,
   injectable hydrogels made of chitosan and hyaluronic acid co-crosslinked
   with beta-glycerophophate and genipin. The gels are highly homogeneous
   and form within 32 min, i. e., faster than gels crosslinked with either
   genipin or b-glycerophophate. The shear strength of co-crosslinked
   hydrogels is 3.5 kPa, higher than any chitosan-based gel reported.
   Chondrocytes and nucleus pulposus cells thrive inside the gels and
   produce large amounts of collagen II. Injection in rats shows that the
   gels form in-vivo within a short time and remain well localized for more
   than one week while the rats remain healthy and active. The excellent
   mechanical properties, fast in-situ gelation, good biocompatibility and
   the ability to encapsulate live cells at physiological conditions make
   these hydrogels ideal for tissue engineering, especially cartilage
   regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a wide-gap material that has attracted
   significant attention as an ideal dielectric substrate for 2D crystal
   heterostructures. We report here the first observation of in-plane
   charge transport in large-area monolayer hBN, grown by chemical vapor
   deposition. The quadratic scaling of current with voltage at high bias
   corresponds to a space-charge limited conduction mechanism, with a
   room-temperature mobility reaching up to 0.01 cm(2)/(V s) at electric
   fields up to 100 kV/cm in the absence of dielectric breakdown. The
   observation of in-plane charge transport highlights the semiconducting
   nature of monolayer hBN, and identifies hBN as a wide-gap 2D crystal
   capable of supporting charge transport at high field. Future exploration
   of charge transport in hBN is motivated by the fundamental study of UV
   optoelectronics and the massive Dirac fermion spectrum of hBN.}},

Abstract = {{H-2 generation under sunlight offers great potential for a sustainable
   fuel production system. To achieve high efficiency solar-to-hydrogen
   conversion, multijunction photoelectrodes have been commonly employed to
   absorb a large portion of the solar spectrum and to provide energetic
   charge carriers for water splitting. However, the design and performance
   of such tandem devices has been fundamentally limited by the current
   matching between various absorbing layers. Here, by exploiting the
   lateral carrier extraction scheme of one-dimensional nanowire
   structures, we have demonstrated that a dual absorber photocathode,
   consisting of p-InGaN/tunnel junction/n-GaN nanowire arrays and a Si
   solar cell wafer, can operate efficiently without the strict current
   matching requirement. The monolithically integrated photocathode
   exhibits an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 8.7\% at a
   potential of 0.33 V versus normal hydrogen electrode and nearly unity
   Faradaic efficiency for H2 generation. Such an adaptive multijunction
   architecture can surpass the design and performance restrictions of
   conventional tandem photoelectrodes.}},

Title = {{Limits of selectivity of direct volumetric solar absorption}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{206-216}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Direct volumetric absorption of solar radiation is possible with fluids
   which have controlled optical properties. As with conventional surface
   absorbers, it is possible to make direct absorbing collectors
   `selective' where short wavelength absorption is maximised, but long
   wavelength emission is minimised. This work investigates the fundamental
   limits of this concept as it pertains to nanofluid-based direct
   absorbing collectors. This is especially important at higher operating
   temperatures (100-600 degrees C) where radiative losses increase
   significantly.
   A study of optical parameters of collector components is conducted
   herein to investigate the best theoretically (and practically)
   achievable `selective' nanofluid-based direct absorbing collectors. When
   the effect of the short wavelength optical properties was investigated,
   a short wavelength optical depth of 3 was found to be sufficient for
   efficient absorption of solar radiation while scattering is minimised.
   It is also advantageous to use a base fluid which shows weak absorption
   at long wavelengths to reduce emission losses.
   Overall, this study directs future research of direct absorption by
   underlying theoretical and real-world limitations of a selective direct
   absorbing collector an emerging receiver technology that can be used for
   efficient solar thermal harvesting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The propagation mechanism of steady cellular detonations in curved
   channels is investigated numerically with a detailed chemical reaction
   mechanism. The numerical results demonstrate that as the radius of the
   curvature decreases, detonation fails near the inner wall due to the
   strong expansion effect. As the radius of the curvature increases, the
   detonation front near the inner wall can sustain an underdriven
   detonation. In the case where detonation fails, a transverse detonation
   downstream forms and re-initiates the quenched detonation as it
   propagates toward the inner wall. Two kinds of propagation modes exist
   as the detonation is propagating in the curved channel. One is that the
   detonation fails first, and then a following transverse detonation
   initiates the quenched detonation and this process repeats itself. The
   other one is that without detonation failure and re-initiation, a steady
   detonation exists which consists of an underdriven detonation front near
   the inner wall subject to the diffraction and an overdriven detonation
   near the outer wall subject to the compression.}},

Abstract = {{Acute nicotine administration stimulates {[}C-14] deoxyglucose trapping
   in thalamus and other regions of rat brain, but acute effects of
   nicotine and smoking on energy metabolism have rarely been investigated
   in human brain by positron emission tomography (PET). We obtained
   quantitative PET measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolic
   rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in 12 smokers who had refrained from smoking
   overnight, and in a historical group of nonsmokers, testing the
   prediction that overnight abstinence results in widespread, coupled
   reductions of CBF and CMRO2. At the end of the abstention period, global
   grey-matter CBF and CMRO2 were both reduced by 17\% relative to
   nonsmokers. At 15 minutes after renewed smoking, global CBF had
   increased insignificantly, while global CMRO2 had increased by 11\%.
   Regional analysis showed that CMRO2 had increased in the left putamen
   and thalamus, and in right posterior cortical regions at this time. At
   60 and 105 minutes after smoking resumption, CBF had increased by 8\%
   and CMRO2 had increased by 11-12\%. Thus, we find substantial and global
   impairment of CBF/CMRO2 in abstaining smokers, and acute restoration by
   resumption of smoking. The reduced CBF and CMRO2 during acute abstention
   may mediate the cognitive changes described in chronic smokers.}},

Abstract = {{Proteins in serum or plasma hold great potential for use in disease
   diagnosis and monitoring. However, the correlation between tumor burden
   and protein biomarker concentration has not been established. Here,
   using an antibody colocalization microarray, the protein concentration
   in serum was measured and compared with the size of mammary xenograft
   tumors in 11 individual mice from the time of injection; seven blood
   samples were collected from each tumor-bearing mouse as well as control
   mice on a weekly basis. The profiles of 38 proteins detected in sera
   from these animals were analyzed by clustering, and we identified 10
   proteins with the greatest relative increase in serum concentration that
   correlated with growth of the primary mammary tumor. To evaluate the
   diagnosis of cancer based on these proteins using either an absolute
   threshold (i.e. a concentration cutoff) or self-referenced differential
   threshold based on the increase in concentration before cell injection,
   receiver operating characteristic curves were produced for 10 proteins
   with increased concentration, and the area under curve was calculated
   for each time point based on a single protein or on a panel of proteins,
   in each case showing a rapid increase of the area under curve. Next, the
   sensitivity and specificity of individual and optimal protein panels
   were calculated, showing high accuracy as early as week 2. These results
   provide a foundation for studies of tumor growth through measuring
   serial changes of protein concentration in animal models.}},

Title = {{Notch1 Is Pan-Endothelial at the Onset of Flow and Regulated by Flow}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Arteriovenous differentiation is a key event during vascular development
   and hemodynamic forces play an important role. Arteriovenous gene
   expression is present before the onset of flow, however it remains
   plastic and flow can alter arteriovenous identity. Notch signaling is
   especially important in the genetic determination of arteriovenous
   identity. Nevertheless, the effect of the onset of circulation on Notch
   expression and signaling has not been studied. The aim of this study is
   therefore to investigate the interaction of Notch1 signaling and
   hemodynamic forces during early vascular development. We find that the
   onset of Notch1 expression coincides with the onset of flow, and that
   expression is pan-endothelial at the onset of circulation in mouse
   embryos and only becomes arterial-specific after remodeling has
   occurred. When we ablate flow in the early embryo, endothelial cells
   fail to express Notch1. We show that low and disturbed flow patterns
   upregulate Notch1 expression in endothelial cells in vitro, but that
   higher shear stress levels do not (>= 10 dynes/cm(2)). Using siRNA, we
   knocked down Notch1 to investigate the role of Notch1 in
   mechanotransduction. When we applied shear stress levels similar to
   those found in embryonic arteries, we found an upregulation of Klf2,
   Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, Hey1, Nrp1 and CoupTFII but that only Dll4, Hey1, Nrp1
   and EphB4 required Notch1 for flow-induced expression. Our results
   therefore indicate that Notch1 can modulate mechanotransduction but is
   not a critical mediator of the process since many genes mechanotransduce
   normally in the absence of Notch1, including genes involved in
   arteriovenous differentiation.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},

Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{69-78}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recycled polyamide 6 (PA6) from post-industrial waste fibers (PIW) and
   post-consumer carpet waste (PCW) are characterized in this study.
   Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis
   (DMA) indicate the presence of polypropylene (PP) in PCW. Furthermore,
   measured ash content of PCW is ca. 6 wt.\%, while PIW has only 0.5 wt.\%
   inorganic content. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   show that inorganic contaminants of PCW and PIW are calcium carbonate
   (CaCO3) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), respectively. Due to higher
   inorganic filler content, PCW exhibits higher melt viscosity and higher
   storage modulus than that of PIW. PIW has 20\% higher tensile strength
   than that of PCW. However, a drastic 70\% drop is observed in vibration
   weld strength of PCW, which is attributed to its PP contamination. The
   negative effect of PP on the weld strength of recycled PA6 is also
   confirmed by measuring the mechanical properties of model compounds.

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of
   performing sheathless 5Fr transradial percutaneous coronary
   interventions (PCI) using 4Fr diagnostic catheters as dilators.
   BackgroundThere is a direct association between artery-catheter mismatch
   and risk of radial artery occlusion.
   MethodsWe recruited 130 patients who underwent 4Fr sheathless diagnostic
   angiography with super torque (Cordis Corporation, USA) catheters
   followed by ad hoc PCI. To facilitate skin and vessel penetration, the
   Judkins right catheter (110 cm) was inserted inside the 5Fr guiding
   catheter (100 cm) as dilator.
   ResultsThe mean age of patients was 6312 years with 74\% of males.
   Unfractionated heparin monotherapy was used in 84\%, bivalirudin in
   12\%, and platelet glycoprotein 2b/3a inhibitors in 13\%. Right radial
   artery was used in 99\%. In three cases, no PCI was performed (FFR) and
   in two (1.5\%) cases, a sheath was required after guiding catheter
   insertion due to local bleeding. In six cases (4.6\%), upscale to 6Fr
   sheathed approach was required. No spasm occurred. Overall procedural
   success was achieved in 114/119 (96\%) cases, including left main PCI,
   bifurcation PCI in 10 (8\%) cases, CTO in 5 (4\%) and IVUS use in 6
   (5\%) cases. Immediately after hemostasis completion, duplex ultrasound
   showed normal flow in 76\%, occlusive thrombus in 13\%,
   pseudo-aneurysmal dilatation in 11\% and local hematoma surrounding
   puncture site in 20\%. Hemoglobin dropped from 138 +/- 19 g/l to 131 +/-
   16 g/l 4-6 hours after PCI.
   ConclusionUsing 4Fr diagnostic catheters as dilators, simple and complex
   PCI can be performed with standard 5Fr guiding catheters as sheathless
   techniques. However, suboptimal transition between diagnostic and
   guiding catheters likely creates radial artery trauma leading to
   frequent occlusive thrombus and hematoma surrounding the radial artery.

Abstract = {{There are varying, often conflicting, reports with respect to altered
   striatal volume and morphometry in the major psychoses due to the
   influences of antipsychotic medications on striatal volume. Thus,
   disassociating disease effects from those of medication become
   exceedingly difficult. For the first time, using a longitudinally
   studied sample of structural magnetic resonance images from patients
   with childhood onset schizophrenia (COS; neurobiologically contiguous
   with the adult onset form of schizophrenia), their nonpsychotic siblings
   (COSSIBs), and novel shape mapping algorithms that are volume
   independent, we report the familial contribution of striatal morphology
   in schizophrenia. The results of our volumetric analyses demonstrate
   age-related increases in overall striatal volumes specific only to COS.
   However, both COS and COSSIBs showed overlapping shape differences in
   the striatal head, which normalized in COSSIBs by late adolescence.
   These results mirror previous studies from our group, demonstrating
   cortical thickness deficits in COS and COSSIBs as these deficits
   normalize in COSSIBs in the same age range as our striatal findings.
   Finally, there is a single region of nonoverlapping outward displacement
   in the dorsal aspect of the caudate body, potentially indicative of a
   response to medication. Striatal shape may be considered complimentary
   to volume as an endophenotype, and, in some cases may provide
   information that is not detectable using standard volumetric techniques.
   Our striatal shape findings demonstrate the striking localization of
   abnormalities in striatal the head. The neuroanatomical localization of
   these findings suggest the presence of abnormalities in the
   striatal-prefrontal circuits in schizophrenia and resilience mechanisms
   in COSSIBs with age dependent normalization. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{We propose a low-power content-addressable memory (CAM) employing a new
   algorithm for associativity between the input tag and the corresponding
   address of the output data. The proposed architecture is based on a
   recently developed sparse clustered network using binary connections
   that on-average eliminates most of the parallel comparisons performed
   during a search. Therefore, the dynamic energy consumption of the
   proposed design is significantly lower compared with that of a
   conventional low-power CAM design. Given an input tag, the proposed
   architecture computes a few possibilities for the location of the
   matched tag and performs the comparisons on them to locate a single
   valid match. TSMC 65-nm CMOS technology was used for simulation
   purposes. Following a selection of design parameters, such as the number
   of CAM entries, the energy consumption and the search delay of the
   proposed design are 8\%, and 26\% of that of the conventional NAND
   architecture, respectively, with a 10\% area overhead. A design
   methodology based on the silicon area and power budgets, and performance
   requirements is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Using ABAQUS/Explicit, the effects of contact conditions between the
   particle and substrate, including tangential friction, normal
   constraint, and contact geometry on the plastic deformation during the
   cold-spray process are studied. It was found that the onset of shear
   instability, an event often used to indicate the establishment of
   bonding, is very sensitive to the choice of contact conditions. This
   suggests that the onset of shear instability does not serve as an
   accurate means to identify the plasticity threshold responsible for
   bonding. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that the evolution of the
   overall equivalent plastic strain (i.e., ) and the overall von Mises
   stress, being linearly proportional to each other, are both independent
   of contact conditions. Furthermore, it is shown that an energy value,
   defined as the product of the and the von Mises stress integrated over
   all particle elements, can quantitatively represent the energy
   dissipated via plastic deformation while being independent of contact
   conditions. The and associated energy value as defined may provide
   robust tools to assess the plasticity and the consequent bonding during

Title = {{Detection of Otoacoustic Emissions in Chinchilla When the Middle Ear

Journal = {{LARYNGOSCOPE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Objectives/HypothesisOtoacoustic emissions have frequently been used for
   newborn hearing screening. However, they have low specificities and high
   referral rates. The presence of amniotic fluid in the middle ear is one
   reason for these problems. The aim of this study was to determine the
   effects of human amniotic fluid on otoacoustic emissions and on
   middle-ear function.
   MethodsForty-six chinchillas were randomly divided into eight groups
   based on the type (amniotic fluid or normal saline) and volume (0.5, 1,
   1.5, 2 ml) of liquid introduced into the middle ear. Distortion product
   otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and wideband reflectance (WBR) measurements
   were taken under inhalational anaesthesia before and after introduction
   of middle-ear liquid. The differences in these measurements were
   subjected to statistical analyses.
   Study DesignProspective controlled animal study.
   ResultsSignificant reductions of DPOAE levels and increases in WBR
   occurred across all frequencies when there was liquid in the middle ear,
   and the changes became greater for increased volumes of liquid. Changes
   in the noise level had important effects on the otoacoustic-emission
   signal-to-noise ratio at the three lowest frequencies.
   ConclusionBoth human amniotic fluid and saline in the chinchilla middle
   ear resulted in changes in otoacoustic-emission detection patterns and
   WBR that may be relevant to newborn hearing screening.

   user interface is also created for quantitative analysis of locomotion
   parameters (swimming frequency and bend amplitude) of the nematodes in
   response to chemical stimuli, thus greatly enhancing the efficiency of
   data collection. We perform proof-of-concept experiments using two

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the cyclic behavior of deep wide-flange
   sections, used as columns in steel Special Moment Frames (SMFs), through
   detailed finite element (FE) analysis. A wide range of wide-flange
   sections is subjected to symmetric cyclic lateral loading combined with
   different levels of constant compressive axial load ratios representing
   the loading conditions of interior steel columns in SMFs. The FE
   simulations demonstrate that wide-flange beam-columns, with web and
   flange slenderness ratios near the current compactness limits of seismic
   design provisions (AISC 341-10), experience rapid cyclic deterioration
   in flexural strength under high axial load ratios. It is also found that
   deep wide-flange slender sections shorten axially to about 10 \% of
   their length due to severe flange and web local buckling. Based on the
   FE simulations, for bottom story columns, where axial load ratios are in
   the range of 20-35 \%, a reduction to about two thirds of the current
   compactness limit for highly ductile members would achieve a 4 \% chord
   rotation while maintaining a flexural strength larger than 80 \% of the
   expected plastic flexural strength of a steel column. The FE simulation
   results also suggest that the pre-capping rotation predicted by current
   modeling recommendations for steel components (PEER/ATC 72-1) is
   overestimated for sections with high web and flange slenderness ratios
   undergoing monotonic and/or cyclic lateral loading combined with high
   axial load levels.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems such as cell-laden hydrogels are
   superior to standard two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures for many
   drug-screening applications. However, their adoption into
   high-throughput screening (HTS) has been lagging, in part because of the
   difficulty of incorporating these culture formats into existing robotic
   liquid handling and imaging infrastructures. Dispensing cell-laden
   prepolymer solutions into 2D well plates is a potential solution but
   typically requires large volumes of reagents to avoid evaporation during
   polymerization, which (1) increases costs, (2) makes drug penetration
   variable and (3) complicates imaging. Here we describe a technique to
   efficiently produce 3D microgels using automated liquid-handling systems
   and standard, nonpatterned, flat-bottomed, 384-well plates.
   Sub-millimeter-diameter, cell-laden collagen gels are deposited on the
   bottom of a 2.5 mm diameter microwell with no concerns about evaporation
   or meniscus effects at the edges of wells, using aqueous two-phase
   system patterning. The microscale cell-laden collagen-gel constructs are
   readily imaged and readily penetrated by drugs. The cytotoxicity of
   chemotherapeutics was monitored by bioluminescence and demonstrated that
   3D cultures confer chemoresistance as compared with similar 2D cultures.
   Hence, these data demonstrate the importance of culturing cells in 3D to
   obtain realistic cellular responses. Overall, this system provides a
   simple and inexpensive method for integrating 3D culture capability into
   existing HTS infrastructure.}},

   crystallization behaviour among the various salts were linked to the
   hydration energy of the cation. None of the tested metal chlorides could
   be successfully separated, due to enhanced metal chloride solubility in
   non-aqueous solvents relative to water by formation of chloro-complexes
   with larger stability constants.
   CONCLUSIONSThe solvent displacement crystallization process was
   investigated and selection criteria for the organic solvent were
   established. 2-propanol proved to be the most effective salting out
   agent for metal sulfates resulting in>90\% cation removal. By contrast
   none of the metal chlorides could be successfully separated due to
   salting-in behaviour. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{A packaged silicon photonic traveling wave Mach-Zehnder modulator
   operating at 1310 nm is presented and studied. The modulator is a series
   push-pull device and requires a bias applied to the common n-doped
   region. Effects of varying the bias voltage on the modulator's V-pi,
   bandwidth, and on chip-insertion loss are studied, and its impact on
   transmission performance are experimentally investigated for PAM-4 and
   PAM-8 formats at a throughput of 112 Gb/s, over varying distances of 0,
   2, 10, and 20 km. Residual chromatic dispersion is shown to have no
   impact on performance up to 20 km. The PAMRF driving waveform is
   generated by an 8-bit digital-to-analog converter, while direct
   detection is done with a PIN+TIA followed by an 8-bit analog-to-digital
   converter. This IM/DD system utilizes digital signal processing with
   transmitter spectral compensation and receiver residual equalization.
   The performance impact for a varying number of transmitter
   precompensation taps and receiver equalization taps is studied, which
   has a direct impact on the transceiver's power consumption. Using PAM-4,
   a BER below the FEC limit is obtained for either combinations of
   (transmitter, receiver) tap lengths: (19,19), (7,27), or (35,7),
   allowing flexibility in power consumption distribution.}},

Abstract = {{A polarization-division-multiplexed (PDM) intensity-modulation/
   direct-detection (IM/DD) system enabled by a novel multiple-input and
   multiple-output DSP operating in the Stokes space following a DD
   receiver is demonstrated. Modulating the intensity of the two orthogonal
   polarization states of a single laser enables doubling the maximum
   achievable bit rate per wavelength channel, which halves the number of
   required laser sources in a transceiver using PDM and WDM to achieve an
   aggregate bit rate compared to using only WDM. Quantitatively, 224 Gb/s
   is experimentally transmitted over 10 km using a single 1310-nm laser
   and a silicon photonic intensity modulator using 56-Gbaud PDM PAM-4 with
   a BER of 4.1 x 10(-3). Also, PDM enables halving the baud rate needed to
   achieve 112 Gb/s resulting in 20-km transmission at low BERs
   (10(-5)-10(-6)), using either 56-Gbaud PAM-2 or 28-Gbaud PAM-4. These
   low pre-FEC BERs achieved at 112 Gb/s allowreducing the FEC overhead
   required compared to a single polarization system that employs twice the
   baud rate to achieve the same bit rate. Though the transceiver was
   implemented using discrete components, it can be fully integrated on a
   SiP chip, enabling its practical realization for short-reach optical
   interconnects inside datacenters. Finally, in addition to the
   experimental results, we perform simulations to further investigate the
   performance of the receiver. In particular, we studied the impact of
   varying the splitting ratios of the two couplers in the proposed
   front-end and concluded that using 67/33 couplers instead of 50/50
   couplers renders the performance completely independent of the state of
   polarization of the received signal.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effect of the volume fraction of steel
   fibers on the axial load response of 200 MPa ultrahigh-strength concrete
   (UHSC) columns. Behavioral aspects investigated include strength,
   ductility, and delay and control of brittle concrete cover spalling. In
   addition, the influence of the amount of transverse reinforcement and
   the combined effect of transverse reinforcement and steel fibers on the
   postpeak behavior of the 200 MPa UHSC columns were investigated. Two
   series of columns, having different amounts of transverse reinforcement,
   rho(sh) = 3.6 and 6.1\%, were constructed and tested under pure axial
   compressive loading. Each series consisted of three columns with three
   different steel fiber volume fractions (v(f) = 0, 1, and 1.5\%). Test
   results demonstrated that an increase of transverse reinforcement
   amounts in 200 MPa UHSC columns improves the maximum confined concrete
   strength and significantly improves the postpeak ductility. The addition
   of steel fibers resulted in increased peak loads for both the poorly and
   well confined 200 MPa UHSC columns by delaying and controlling initial
   cover spalling. The addition of steel fibers improves the confined
   concrete strength and significantly improves postpeak ductility only for
   the well confined UHSC columns. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Over the course of the last twenty years, participatory modeling has
   increasingly been advocated as an integral component of integrated,
   adaptive, and collaborative water resources management. However, issues
   of high cost, time, and expertise are significant hurdles to the
   widespread adoption of participatory modeling in many developing
   countries. In this study, a step-wise method to initialize the
   involvement of key stakeholders in the development of qualitative system
   dynamics models (i.e. causal loop diagrams) is presented. The proposed
   approach is designed to overcome the challenges of low expertise, time
   and financial resources that have hampered previous participatory
   modeling efforts in developing countries. The methodological framework
   was applied in a case study of soil salinity management in the Rechna
   Doab region of Pakistan, with a focus on the application of qualitative
   modeling through stakeholder-built causal loop diagrams to address soil
   salinity problems in the basin. Individual causal loop diagrams were
   developed by key stakeholder groups, following which an overall group
   causal loop diagram of the entire system was built based on the
   individual causal loop diagrams to form a holistic qualitative model of
   the whole system. The case study demonstrates the usefulness of the
   proposed approach, based on using causal loop diagrams in initiating
   stakeholder involvement in the participatory model building process. In
   addition, the results point to social-economic aspects of soil salinity
   that have not been considered by other modeling studies to date. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper examines a non-cooperative game in pre-coding design for MIMO
   multiple-access channels with dynamic access point (AP) selection. This
   game is first shown to be a potential game, where the potential function
   is the sum rate achieved by successive interference cancellation. Due to
   the mixed-integer nature of the optimization variable, it is challenging
   to directly characterize the maximum of the potential function, which
   are closely related to the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game. Instead,
   we establish the existence and achievability of the maximum through
   non-decreasing and upperbounded properties of the potential function as
   a direct result of our proposed update scheme. A distributed algorithm
   is designed where each player selfishly optimizes its AP selection and
   linear precoding strategy in a sequential manner. Convergence is a
   by-product of the established properties of the potential function which
   are materialized by an iterative waterfilling algorithm. Numerical
   results show that the algorithm is able to reach fast convergence and
   provides a system sum rate nearing that of the optimal centralized
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we propose a semiblind channel estimation technique for
   OFDM/OQAM wireless systems. The proposed technique exploits the real
   property of transmitted symbols to blindly identify the channel-induced
   rotation in the received signal, thereby reducing the pilot overhead for
   estimation purpose. Specifically, the channel phase over each subcarrier
   can be obtained from the spatial-sign covariance matrix of the received
   signal, while the channel amplitude can be expressed in terms of the
   subcarrier power. In effect, the frequency-domain noise can be reduced
   effectively by block averaging over multiple symbols. Since the channel
   delay spread is usually much smaller than the symbol duration, channel
   coefficients obtained from the estimated phase and amplitude can be
   further refined through low-rank filtering. Simulation results validate
   the efficacy of the proposed technique in time-dispersive fading
   channels, showing its robustness under different signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) conditions.}},

Title = {{Micro CT analysis of spine architecture in a mouse model of scoliosis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Mice homozygous for targeted deletion of the gene encoding
   fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3(-/-)) develop kyphoscoliosis
   by 2 months of age. The first objective of this study was to use high
   resolution X-ray to characterize curve progression in vivo and micro CT
   to quantify spine architecture ex vivo in FGFR3(-/-) mice. The second
   objective was to determine if slow release of the bone anabolic peptide
   parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP-1-34) from a pellet placed
   adjacent to the thoracic spine could inhibit progressive kyphoscoliosis.
   Materials and methods: Pellets loaded with placebo or PTHrP-1-34 were
   implanted adjacent to the thoracic spine of 1-month-old FGFR3(-/-) mice
   obtained from in house breeding. X rays were captured at monthly
   intervals up to 4 months to quantify curve progression using the Cobb
   method. High resolution post-mortem scans of FGFR3(-/-) and FGFR3(+/+)
   spines, from C5/6 to L4/5, were captured to evaluate the 3D structure,
   rotation, and micro-architecture of the affected vertebrae.
   Un-decalcified and decalcified histology were performed on the apical
   and adjacent vertebrae of FGFR3(-/-) spines, and the corresponding
   vertebrae from FGFR3(+/+) spines.
   Results:The mean Cobb angle was significantly greater at all ages in
   FGFR3(-/-) mice compared with wild type mice and appeared to stabilize
   around skeletal maturity at 4 months. 3D reconstructions of the thoracic
   spine of 4-month-old FGFR3(-/-) mice treated with PTHrP-1-34 revealed
   correction of left/right asymmetry, vertebral rotation, and lateral
   displacement compared with mice treated with placebo. Histologic
   analysis of the apical vertebrae confirmed correction of the asymmetry
   in PTHrP-1-34 treated mice, in the absence of any change in bone volume,
   and a significant reduction in the wedging of intervertebral disks (IVD)
   seen in placebo treated mice.
   Conclusion: Local treatment of the thoracic spine of juvenile FGFR3(-/-)
   mice with a bone anabolic agent inhibited progression of scoliosis, but
   with little impact on kyphosis. The significant improvement in IVD
   integrity suggests PTHrP-1-34 might also be considered as a therapeutic
   agent for degenerative disk disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The scaled skin of fish is a high-performance natural armor that
   represents a source of inspiration for novel engineering designs. In
   this paper, we present a biomitnetic fish skin material, fabricated with
   a design, and, components that are simple, that achieves Many of the
   advantageous attributes of natural materials, including the unique
   combination of flexibility and mechanical robustness. The bioinspired
   fish skin Material is designed to replicate the structural, mechanical,
   and functional aspects of a natural teleost fish Skin comprised of
   leptoid-like scales, similar to that of the striped red Mullet,Mullus
   surmuletus. The man-made fish skin material,consists of a low-moduhis
   elastic meth or ``derniis{''} layer that holds rigid, plastic scales :
   The mechanics of the synthetic material is characterized under in-plane,
   bending, and indentation Modes of defOrmation and is successfully
   described by theoretical deformation models that have been developed.
   This combined experimental and modeling approach elucidates the critical
   mechanisms by which the composite material achieves its unique
   properties and provides design rules that allow for the engineering of
   scaled Such artificial scaled skins that are flexible, lightweight,
   transparent, and robust under mechanical deformation may thus have
   potential as thin protective coatings for soft materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the Mann-Kendall
   (MK) trend test, and the sequential Mann-Kendall test are applied to
   temperature series at different time scales in order to detect the
   long-term trends (1956-2010) in synoptic-scale surface temperatures in
   Iran, as well as the dominant time scales affecting these temperature
   time series. The relevant data was extracted from a gridded data file of
   the region (44 degrees E to 63.5 degrees E, 25 degrees N to 40 degrees
   N) and divided into 12 regular zones (of dimensions 5 x 5 degrees), each
   of which was analyzed as an individual unit. The results of this
   research show that at the monthly, seasonal and annual time scales, the
   trends in temperature were significant and positive in all of the study
   zones. In addition, the 2-month and 4-month components were dominant at
   the monthly time scale, the 48-month component dominant at the seasonal
   time scale, and the 8-year and 16-year components dominant at the annual
   time scale. Also, the temperature trends in the northern, and especially
   central, regions of the study zones increased from west to east, and
   these increasing trends in temperature were most prominent for the
   spring and summer seasons. The methodology applied here is generally
   applicable and quite useful for studying both trends and the dominant
   time scales affecting climatic data series and could find significant
   applications in related fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The design of a robust superhydrophobic surface is a widely pursued
   topic. While many investigations are limited to applications with high
   impact velocities (for raindrops of the order of a few meters per
   second), the essence of robustness is yet to be analyzed for
   applications involving quasi-static liquid transfer. To achieve
   robustness with high impact velocities, the surface parameters
   (geometrical details, chemistry) have to be selected from a narrow range
   of permissible values, which often entail additional manufacturing
   costs. From the dual perspectives of thermodynamics and mechanics, we
   analyze the significance of robustness for quasi-static drop impact, and
   present the range of permissible surface characteristics. For surfaces
   with a Young's contact angle greater than 90 degrees and square
   micropillar geometry, we show that robustness can be enforced when an
   intermediate wetting state (sagged state) impedes transition to a wetted
   state (Wenzel state). From the standpoint of mechanics, we use available
   scientific data to prove that a surface with any topology must withstand
   a pressure of 117 Pa to be robust. Finally, permissible values of
   surface characteristics are determined, which ensure robustness with
   thermodynamics (formation of a sagged state) and mechanics (withstanding
   117 Pa).}},

   portulacastrum: implication of organic acids in these processes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The implication of organic acids in Cd and Ni translocation was studied
   in the halophyte species Sesuvium portulacastrum. Citric, fumaric,
   malic, and ascorbic acids were separated and quantified by HPLC
   technique in shoots, roots and xylem saps of plants grown on nutrient
   solutions added with 50 mu M Cd, 100 mu M Ni and the combination of 50
   mu M Cd + 100 mu M Ni. Results showed that Cd had no significant impact
   on biomass production while Ni and the combination of both metals
   drastically affected plant development. Cadmium and Ni concentrations in
   tissues and xylem sap were higher in plants subjected to individual
   metal application than those subjected to the combined effect of Cd and
   Ni suggesting a possible competition between these metals for
   absorption. Both metals applied separately or in combination induced an
   increase in citrate concentration in shoots and xylem sap but a decrease
   of this concentration in the roots. However, a minor relationship was
   observed between metal application and fumaric, malic, and ascorbic
   acids. Both observations suggest the implication of citric acid in Cd,
   Ni translocation and shoot accumulation in S. portulacastrum. The
   relatively high accumulation of citric acid in xylem sap and shoot of S.
   portulacastrum could be involved in metal chelation and thus contributes
   to heavy metal tolerance in this species.}},

Abstract = {{The present work investigates the effect of adding Mo and Mn to an
   Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloy on the formation of thermally stable dispersoids. Mo
   and Mn in combination formed a large volume fraction of uniformly
   distributed dispersoids within the Al matrix, because of the opposite
   partitioning behavior (k(Mo) > 1 vs. k(Mn) < 1) during the
   non-equilibrium solidification. Mo (without Mn) formed coherent alpha-Al
   (Fe,Mo)Si dispersoids with a BCC lattice, which were mostly located
   within intradendritic regions. Subsequent addition of Mn increased the
   amount of the dispersoids by substituting the Fe atoms. The combined
   addition also led to a more uniform dispersoid distribution by
   eliminating the interdendritic dispersoid-free zones (DFZs).
   Consequently, creep resistance in the temperature range of 300-350
   degrees C improved significantly. At 300 degrees C and 30 MPa, the
   minimum creep rate decreased, and creep time-to-fracture and
   strain-to-fracture each increased with increasing Mn up to 0.5 wt\%.
   Further addition of Mn resulted in increased presence of the eutectic
   intermetallics in the interdendritic regions, which deteriorated the
   ductility of the alloy leading to a shorter creep-life time. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission techniques constitute
   an important technology in modern wireless communication. Hence,
   performance analysis methods for such systems are of considerable
   interest. This paper considers first the average pairwise error
   probability for uncoded MIMO systems employing maximum likelihood
   detection over a composite Rayleigh-Lognormal fading channel with
   spatial correlation. It provides general results, applicable also to a
   wider class of shadowing models, concerning asymptotical diversity gains
   and shows that they are not changed by such shadowing. Then, analytical
   evaluation techniques for bit-error-rate (BER) over composite
   Rayleigh-Lognormal fading channels, based on the truncated union bound
   and the transfer function, are considered. Furthermore, these techniques
   are modified for applications over spatially correlated channels. This
   paper shows that such performance evaluation techniques provide good
   approximations to BER of spatially uncorrelated MIMO systems and also in
   the presence of moderate spatial correlation, over Rayleigh-Lognormal
   fading channels. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study shows that modular multilevel converter (MMC) can implement
   deadbeat control and harmonic elimination together. MMC, under
   single-phase deadbeat control, tracks the current reference exclusively,
   so that it is: (i) safe from large destructive currents of ac faults;
   and (ii) free from the odd harmonics generated by the non-linearities of
   MMC. As a deadbeat control cannot filter even harmonics on the dc-side,
   harmonic elimination has to be done by joint feedback-feedforward
   methods. However, the cost saving from capacitor size reduction, made
   possible by the harmonic elimination, comes to naught when large ac
   fault currents charge the capacitors to voltage levels destructive to
   insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Deadbeat, in preventing the flow of
   large fault currents, safeguards capacitor size reduction made possible
   by the harmonic elimination methods. Redundant protection by the methods
   enhances reliability. Claims are validated by simulations by SIMULINK of
   MATLAB.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of propolis
   treatment for reducing anthracnose development on mango fruit of variety
   Kent; and compare its efficacy to chitosan treatment, which is already a
   well-studied natural produce. For in vitro experiments, Petri plates
   were amended with (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5\% v/v) propolis or (0,
   0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0\% w/v) chitosan solutions. For the in vivo
   experiments, mangoes were infected with a spore suspension of
   Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and solution of either propolis (1.5\%)
   or chitosan (1.5\%) were used for controlling the pathogen development.
   The fruits were stored for 14 days at 12 +/- 1 degrees C and 83 +/- 2\%
   RH, and then, for another 7 days at 23 degrees C, 82\%. Lesion area,
   firmness, chemical composition, as well as color of the skin were used
   for evaluating and compare the performance of the two products. Even if
   the in vitro results demonstrated the net superiority of propolis for
   controlling the development of the pathogen, the in vitro results showed
   the opposite order when classifying the performance of the products with
   alive fresh produce. The results obtained suggested that propolis, as
   well as chitosan, may be used as treatment for controlling anthracnose,
   maintaining quality, and increasing the shelf life in `Kent' mango.
   However, propolis was far from producing competitive results to chitosan
   treatment performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A highly efficient surface plasmon resonance (SPR) immunosensor is
   described using a functionalized single graphene layer on a thin gold

   signal by growing graphene through chemical vapor deposition and,
   second, to control the immobilization of biotinylated cholera toxin
   antigen on copper coordinated nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) using graphene
   as an ultrathin layer. The NTA groups were attached to graphene via
   pyrene derivatives implying pi-pi interactions. With this setup, an
   immunosensor for the specific antibody anticholera toxin with a
   detection limit of 4 pg mL(-1) was obtained. In parallel, NTA
   polypyrrole films of different thicknesses were electrogenerated on the
   gold sensing platform where the optimal electropolymerization conditions
   were determined. For this optimized polypyrrole-NTA setup, the simple
   presence of a graphene layer between the gold and polymer film led to a
   significant increase of the SPR signal.}},

Abstract = {{Haulage drifts in deep hard rock mines require special attention in
   ensuring their long-term stability and safety, as these drifts must
   remain functional during the life of a mine plan. The stability of a
   haulage drift is influenced by many factors, most notably nearby stoping
   activities and the distance between the drift and production stopes.
   Thus, the evaluation of drift support performance before and during
   nearby stope extraction is important. In this study, numerical modelling
   is performed to evaluate the support performance in the drift. In order
   to calibrate the numerical model, selected bolts were instrumented with
   load cells to measure the axial load acting on the bolts as mining
   progresses. The load distribution along the rockbolt is computed after
   each mining step. The peak load is found to be consistently at the bolt
   head in both the fully grouted rebar and the modified cone bolt. It is
   found that same-level mining of nearby stopes has a more severe effect
   on the drift support system than lower-level mining. The optimum timing
   for enhanced support system installation with respect to stope
   sequencing is also examined.}},

Abstract = {{In vitro motility and laser trap assays are commonly used for molecular
   mechanics measurements. However, chemicals cannot be added during these
   measurements, because they create flows that alter the molecular
   mechanics. Thus, we designed a microfluidic device that allows the
   addition of chemicals without creating bulk flows. Biocompatibility of
   the components of this device was tested. A microchannel chamber was
   created by photolithography with the patterns transferred to
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The PDMS chamber was bound to a
   polycarbonate membrane, which itself was bound to a molecular mechanics
   chamber. The microchannels ensured rapid distribution of the chemicals
   over the membrane, whereas the membrane ensured efficient delivery to
   the mechanics chamber while preventing bulk flow. The biocompatibility
   of the materials was tested by comparing the velocity (nu(max)) of
   propulsion by myosin of fluorescently labeled actin filaments to that of
   the conventional assay; no difference in nu(max) was observed. To
   estimate total chemical delivery time, labeled bovine serum albumin was
   injected in the channel chamber and TIRF was used to determine the time
   to reach the assay surface (2.7 +/- 0.1 s). Furthermore, the standard
   distance of a trapped microsphere calculated during buffer diffusion
   using the microfluidic device (14.9 +/- 3.2 nm) was not different from
   that calculated using the conventional assay (15.6 +/- 5.3 nm, p =
   0.922). Finally, nu(max) obtained by injecting adenosine triphosphate
   (ATP) in the microchannel chamber (2.37 +/- 0.48 mu m/s) was not
   different from that obtained when ATP was delivered directly to the
   mechanics chamber (2.52 +/- 0.42 mu m/s, p = 0.822). This microfluidic
   prototype validates the design for molecular mechanics measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The eco-toxicological indicators used to evaluate soil quality
   complement the physico-chemical criteria employed in contaminated site
   remediation, but their cost, time, sophisticated analytical methods and
   in-situ inapplicability pose a major challenge to rapidly detect and map
   the extent of soil contamination. This paper describes a sensor-based
   approach for measuring potential (substrate-induced) microbial
   respiration in diesel-contaminated and non-contaminated soil and hence,
   indirectly evaluates their microbial activity. A simple CO2 sensing
   system was developed using an inexpensive non-dispersive infrared (NDIR)
   CO2 sensor and was successfully deployed to differentiate the control
   and diesel-contaminated soils in terms of CO2 emission after glucose
   addition. Also, the sensor system distinguished glucose-induced CO2
   emission from sterile and control soil samples (p 0.0001). Significant
   effects of diesel contamination (p 0.0001) and soil type (p 0.0001) on
   glucose-induced CO2 emission were also found. The developed sensing
   system can provide in-situ evaluation of soil microbial activity, an
   indicator of soil quality. The system can be a promising tool for the
   initial screening of contaminated environmental sites to create high
   spatial density maps at a relatively low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Hysteresis models can incorporate the effects of operating conditions
   (frequency, stress, and temperature) on iron losses incurred in
   ferromagnetic materials. Among such models, the Jiles-Atherton (JA) and
   Preisach models are the most popular and various modifications of these
   have been proposed in the literature to model the effect of frequency,
   stress, and temperature on iron losses. Both of these representations
   produce accurate results compared with the curve fitting models and can
   be directly implemented in finite element simulations. Unfortunately, it
   is very difficult to incorporate all these effects into a single iron
   loss model that is computationally efficient and can predict iron losses
   with reasonable accuracy for a given range of these parameters. In this
   paper, an effort has been made to establish a relationship between JA
   and Preisach models and an interpolation-based approach is presented to
   predict iron losses that utilizes the Preisach model on top of the JA
   model and incorporates all of the above factors. It is shown that iron
   loss can be predicted accurately for any value of frequency, stress, and
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The nonconforming voxel finite-element method (NVFEM) models material
   boundaries in a staircase fashion. Recently, a technique called the
   computed basis function (CBF) method was introduced to reduce the errors
   arising from this, but it was applied only to scalar fields. Here, the
   CBF method is developed for vector fields that are represented with 2-D
   edge elements. The method is tested by solving the vector wave equation
   for problems involving perfectly conducting or dielectric obstacles.
   Results show that NVFEM enhanced with CBF can achieve the same accuracy
   as NVFEM with between 6 and 10 times fewer unknowns, with no reduction
   in the sparsity of the global FE matrix.}},

Title = {{Transport of Antibiotic Resistance Plasmids in Porous Media}},
Journal = {{VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Antibiotic resistance plasmids play important roles in resistance
   buildup and spread in soil and groundwater. However, very limited work
   has been reported in the literature to examine the transport behavior of
   free resistance plasmids in the environment. In this work, the transport
   of eight resistance plasmid vectors (pUC18, pBlueScript II SK(+),
   pBR322, pFastBac HT A, pBABE-Puro, pcDNA3.1(+)/myc-His A,
   pcDNA3.1(+)/Flag-His A+ATM, and pAdEasy-1) in quartz sand was
   investigated through packed column experiments. At ionic strengths up to
   0.05 mol L-1 in NaCl solutions and 0.006 mol L-1 in CaCl2 solutions,
   adsorption rate coefficients of all the plasmids examined were <0.19
   h(-1) at a fluid velocity of 6.1 m d(-1). This result indicates that
   under environmentally relevant flow and solution chemistry conditions,
   free plasmids may transport across significant distances and may have
   the potential to spread antibiotic resistance to much larger areas and
   more receptors in the environment. As ionic strength increased,
   adsorption of plasmids in CaCl2 solutions increased dramatically.
   Adsorbed plasmids could be partly desorbed at reduced ionic strengths.
   These observations indicate that the transport behavior of free plasmids
   is very similar to the transport of colloids commonly examined in the
   literature (e.g., latex microspheres and bacteria). No noticeable
   difference in breakthrough concentrations of linear and supercoiled
   plasmids was observed. At higher ionic strengths (0.02 and 0.05 mol L-1)
   in CaCl2, the size of the plasmids was found to play a predominant role
   in governing their transport under identical flow and solution chemistry
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave assisted-degumming/retting of hemp stems Was established and
   the changes in the components like cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin
   during microwave treatment were studied by near infrared (NIR) analysis
   of the fibres processed from the treated hemp stems. Pre-soaked hemp
   stems subjected to microwave assisted degumming/retting at various power
   levels showed significant increase in the cellulose content from 72.1\%
   to 79.8\% when compared with the control samples. The percentage of
   hemicellulose and lignin were the key factors in binding the fibres
   together, which showed significant decrease when subjected to microwave
   treatment. Hemicellulose decreased from 14.5\% to 12.1\% and lignin from
   8\% to 5.5\%. These compositional changes proved the effect of microwave
   energy in fibre separation. Measurements of diameter distribution and
   tensile strength, and colorimetric analysis, were performed to verify
   the effect on the physical properties. Thirty five percent of control
   sample hemp fibre diameters were <23 mu m whereas the microwave-assisted
   retted samples contained more than 50\% of fibre diameter were <23 mu m.
   Colorimetric tests and tensile strength tests did not show any specific
   trends but the results confirmed that the microwave energy did not have
   any significant influence in the changes of the physical qualities
   during the process. The above studies showed the efficiency of microwave
   treatments for the degumming of hemp fibres. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published

Abstract = {{Maple wood biochars produced by microwave pyrolysis were analysed and
   compared in relation to their physical properties such as porosity and
   reflectance of chars. The aim of this research was to investigate the
   feasibility of the selection of relevant wavelengths in Visible/Near
   Infra-Red spectroscopy by combining Maximum R-2 (MAXR) with Multiple
   Linear Regressions (MLR) method to build a predictive model. The
   porosity and yield data of the resulting biochars were used to test the
   model. Based on the spectral information, different mathematical
   techniques were used to group the biochars based on their physical
   properties. Scanning electron microscopy imaging of the biochar samples
   showed that pyrolysis temperature and doping ratio played a major role
   in the formation of microporous structures within the biochars formed
   due to the devolatilisation process during microwave pyrolysis. The FTIR
   analysis was consistent with the scanning electron microscopy
   conclusions, indicating evidence of aliphatic group stretching with
   increase in temperature and doping ratio. The FTIR profile of the
   control (fresh maple wood) sample had a more complex spectrum. With
   increase in pyrolysis temperature, functional group activities decreased
   indicating breaking up of weaker bonds. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published by

Abstract = {{Aortic stenosis (AS), in which the opening of the aortic valve is
   narrowed, is the most common valvular heart disease. Cardiac
   catheterization is considered the reference standard for definitive
   evaluation of AS severity, based on instantaneous systolic value of
   transvalvular pressure gradient (TPG). However, using invasive cardiac
   catheterization might carry high risks knowing that undergoing multiple
   cardiac catheterizations for follow-up in patients with AS is common.
   The objective of this study was to suggest an analytical description of
   the AS that estimates TPG without a need for high risk invasive data
   collection. For this purpose, Navier-Stokes equation coupled with the
   elastic-deformation equation was solved analytically. The estimated TPG
   resulted from the suggested analytical description was validated against
   published in vivo and in vitro measurement data. Very good concordances
   were found between TPG obtained from the analytical formulation and in
   vivo (maximum root mean square error: 3.8 mmHg) and in vitro (maximum
   root mean square error: 9.4 mmHg). The analytical description can be
   integrated to non-invasive imaging modalities to estimate AS severity as
   an alternative to cardiac catheterization to help preventing its risks
   in patients with AS. (C) 2015 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Integration of Shallow Gradients of Shh and Netrin-1 Guides Commissural
   Axons}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{During nervous system development, gradients of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and
   Netrin-1 attract growth cones of commissural axons toward the floor
   plate of the embryonic spinal cord. Mice defective for either Shh or
   Netrin-1 signaling have commissural axon guidance defects, suggesting
   that both Shh and Netrin-1 are required for correct axon guidance.
   However, how Shh and Netrin-1 collaborate to guide axons is not known.
   We first quantified the steepness of the Shh gradient in the spinal cord
   and found that it is mostly very shallow. We then developed an in vitro
   microfluidic guidance assay to simulate these shallow gradients. We
   found that axons of dissociated commissural neurons respond to steep but
   not shallow gradients of Shh or Netrin-1. However, when we presented
   axons with combined Shh and Netrin-1 gradients, they had heightened
   sensitivity to the guidance cues, turning in response to shallower
   gradients that were unable to guide axons when only one cue was present.
   Furthermore, these shallow gradients polarized growth cone Src-family
   kinase (SFK) activity only when Shh and Netrin-1 were combined,
   indicating that SFKs can integrate the two guidance cues. Together, our
   results indicate that Shh and Netrin-1 synergize to enable growth cones
   to sense shallow gradients in regions of the spinal cord where the
   steepness of a single guidance cue is insufficient to guide axons, and
   we identify a novel type of synergy that occurs when the steepness (and
   not the concentration) of a guidance cue is limiting.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a time-division uplink transmission scheme that is applicable
   to future-generation cellular systems by introducing hybrid
   device-to-device (D2D) and infrastructure cooperation. Compared with
   existing frequency-division schemes, the proposed time-division scheme
   achieves the same or better spectral efficiency and outage performance
   with simpler signals and shorter decoding delay. These advantages come
   from sending a different message in each transmission block without
   block Markovity as in existing schemes. Using time-division, the
   proposed scheme divides each transmission frame into three phases with
   variable duration. The two user equipment units (UEs) partially exchange
   their information in the first two phases and then cooperatively
   transmit to the base station (BS) in the third phase. We further
   formulate the end-to-end outage probabilities, considering outages at
   both UEs and the BS. We analyze this outage performance in Rayleigh
   fading environment assuming full channel state information (CSI) at
   receivers and limited CSI at transmitters. Results show that user
   cooperation improves the achievable rate region even under half-duplex
   transmission. Moreover, as the received SNR increases, this uplink
   cooperation significantly reduces outage probabilities and achieves the
   full diversity order despite additional outages at the UEs. These
   characteristics make the proposed scheme appealing for deployment in
   future cellular networks.}},

Abstract = {{Thin organic films with oxygen-bearing functional groups (hydroxyl,
   carboxyl, ...) were prepared by ``co-polymerizing'' gas mixtures of
   ethylene (C2H4) and one of several O-containing oxidizer molecules, O-2,
   CO2, or N2O. This was done either by vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV)
   photo-polymerization or by low-pressure r.f. plasma-assisted CVD. The
   gas mixture ratio, R, permits one to control total oxygen concentration,
   {[}O], as well as the relative proportions of the various
   functionalities. Analyses were performed by XPS (with or without
   chemical derivatization using TFAA to determine {[}-OH] content), and
   IRRAS-FTIR. Temporal and structural stability (mass change) of deposits
   under exposure to air or water was examined; altogether, data confirmed
   different reaction pathways for VUV and PECVD.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper reports the results of an experimental study of the
   Mach reflection of cellular detonations. Mixtures representing regular
   smoked foil pattern (C2H2 + 2.5O(2) + 70\%Ar) and irregular pattern
   (C2H2 + 2.5O(2), C3H8 + 5O(2)) are used in the experiments. The range of
   the initial pressures used is 3 kPa < Po < 20 kPa which provide a range
   of cell sizes of the detonation front. Schlieren photographs as well as
   smoked foils are used to observe the phenomenon. Wedges of angles
   ranging from 10 degrees < theta < 40 degrees are used. Measurement of
   the Mach stem height with distance traveled from schlieren photographs
   and smoked foils indicate that the triple point lies on a curved
   trajectory instead of a straight line from the wedge apex as obtained
   from self-similar three shock theory. This is due to the finite
   thickness of the detonation front presenting a characteristic length
   scale that renders the self-similar three shock theory invalid.
   Following the work of Hornung and Shepherd et al., the present results
   are analyzed according to the so called frozen and equilibrium limits.
   The results do seem to agree with the frozen limit for the initial
   propagation of the Mach stem near the apex of the wedge when the
   distance traveled by the Mach stem is small compared to the
   characteristic length of the detonation front (e.g. cell size
   ``lambda{''}, hydrodynamic thickness, etc.). In the asymptotic far field
   region when the distance traveled is large compared to the effective
   detonation thickness, the present results appear to approach the
   prediction using three shock theory based on a discontinuous detonation
   front. Thus in spite of the transient three dimensional structure of a
   cellular detonation front, the frozen and equilibrium limit concept
   based on a global quasi-steady reaction zone thickness of the detonation
   front appears to provide a useful scheme to interpret the results.
   Examination of the smoked foils indicate that the interaction of the
   transverse waves of cellular instability with the reflected shock and
   shear layer of the Mach reflection play an important role in the
   description of the triple point region. (C) 2014 The Combustion

Abstract = {{Hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH) constitutes the inorganic component
   of bone. Its formation is regulated by noncollagenous proteins and
   especially negatively charged amino acids present in their structure.
   Here we show that Ca2+ and PO43- ions can interact with both a negative
   (Glu) and a positive (Arg) amino acid, and form aggregates that grow if
   left undisturbed. Depending on how long these aggregates are allowed to
   grow, once they come into contact they give rise to HA crystals that
   form at different times and that differ in content and properties. This
   finding points out that the aging time of precursor solutions is an
   important variable that needs to be taken into account in all
   biomineralization experiments and that not only proteins but also small
   molecules like amino acids can form aggregates that alter biomineral
   formation. The formation of biomolecular aggregates in the aged
   precursor solutions may also mirror what happens in vivo, where
   biominerals are formed upon compartmentalization of precursor ions and
   mineralization inhibitors or promoters.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we analyze hybrid ARQ (HARQ) transmission over the
   independent block fading channel. We consider two scenarios with respect
   to the message sent by the receiver via the feedback channel: i)
   ``conventional{''}, one-bit feedback used to inform the transmitter
   about the decoding success/failure (ACK/NACK), and ii) the multi-bit
   feedback message, where on top of ACK/NACK, the transmitter is provided
   with additional information about the state of the receiver. To minimize
   the outage probability under long-term average and peak power
   constraints, we cast the problems into the dynamic programming (DP)
   framework and solve them for Nakagami-m fading channels. An approximate,
   closed-form solution for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime is
   proposed using geometric programming (GP). The obtained results quantify
   the advantage of the multi-bit feedback over the conventional one-bit
   approach, and show that the power optimization can provide significant
   gains over conventional power-constant HARQ transmissions even in the
   presence of peak-power constraints.}},

Abstract = {{A competitive co-evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve constrained
   robust design problems. The method uses three populations, among which
   one population evolves the values of the design variables and the other
   two evolve the values of two uncertainty variables, accounting for the
   target and feasibility robustness, respectively. An application to the
   robust design (minimisation of torque ripples) of an interior permanent
   magnet machine is presented. Through a worst case analysis, the result
   from the co-evolutionary algorithm is proven to have a more robust
   performance than that of the non-robust optimisation if manufacturing
   tolerance is taken into account. The computation time of the
   co-evolutionary algorithm may be significantly reduced through the use
   of parallel computing environments.}},

Abstract = {{Fe-N-doped graphene containing 0.3 at\% of Fe and 1.9 of N with an
   active specific surface area of 77.5 +/- 4 m(2) g(-1) is synthesized in
   two steps: first N-doped graphene is produced by thermal dissociation of
   methane in an inductively coupled thermal plasma (ICP) reactor and
   subsequently the product is converted to Fe-N-doped graphene by a wet
   chemical method. The catalytic activity of this catalyst toward H2O2
   reduction reaction (HPRR) is studied by rotating disk electrode for fuel
   cell applications. Although the mechanism of HPRR on Fe-N-doped
   graphene, N-doped graphene and graphene is similar, Fe-N-doped graphene
   shows the highest catalytic activity toward HPRR. The exchange current
   density based on the active surface area (j(0A)) of Fe-N-doped graphene
   in Na2SO4 solution is (4.4 +/- 0.2) x 10(-8) A cm(-2), which is 5 times
   greater than j(0A) of the N-doped graphene. Direct reduction of H2O2,
   H2O2 decomposition, O-2 reduction, and O-2 desorption are predicted as
   the reactions involved in the HPRR while O-2 reduction and O-2
   desorption are negligible at low and high overpotentials, respectively.
   Investigation of the effect of the electrolyte and catalyst loading
   reveals that HPRR on Fe-N-doped graphene suffers from kinetic
   limitations especially at low catalyst lodgings, fast rotation rates,
   and strong acidic and basic solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{An understanding of how material parameters, especially orientation and
   misorientation, influence the magnetic properties of non-oriented
   electrical steel (NOES) is important for improving the efficiency of the
   material in service. In this study, the local magnetic properties were
   measured using magnetic Barkhausen noise (MBN) on different test
   locations on different strips of NOES material. Local variations in
   magnetic properties, texture, and misorientation were revealed. A new
   interpretation for misorientation, called the easy axis misorientation
   (EAM), was created to describe the alignment of the magnetic easy axes
   between neighboring grains. This new EAM, visualized as a single value
   parameter or graphed as a distribution, was shown to be more effective
   at predicting the isotropic magnetic properties than previously used
   texture parameters based on standard orientation/misorientation
   definitions. It was found that a larger EAM value, especially when
   associated with a lower small angle EAM intensity distribution, was
   associated with a larger MBN energy. A larger MBN energy has been
   previously associated with lower losses, and therefore a greater
   material efficiency. (C) The Author(s) 2014. This article is published

Abstract = {{Microfluidic capillary systems operate using capillary forces only and
   require capillary pumps (CPs) to transport, regulate, and meter the flow
   of small quantity of liquids. Common CP architectures include arrays of
   posts or tree-like branched conduits that offer many parallel flow
   paths. However, both designs are susceptible to bubble entrapment and
   consequently variation in the metered volume. Here, we present two novel
   CP architectures that deterministically guide the filling front along
   rows while preventing the entrapment of bubbles using variable gap sizes
   between posts. The first CP (serpentine pump) guides the filling front
   following a serpentine path, and the second one (leading-edge pump)
   directs the liquid along one edge of the CP from where liquid fills the
   pump row-by-row. We varied the angle of the rows with respect to the
   pump perimeter and observed filling with minimal variation in pumping
   pressure and volumetric flow rate, confirming the robustness of this
   design. In the case of serpentine CP, the flow resistance for filling
   the first row is high and then decreases as subsequent rows are filled
   and many parallel flow paths are formed. In the leading-edge pump,
   parallel flow paths are formed almost immediately, and hence, no spike
   in flow resistance is observed; however, there is a higher tendency of
   the liquid for skipping a row, requiring more stringent fabrication
   tolerances. The flow rate within a single CP was adjusted by tuning the
   gap size between the microposts within the CP so as to create a gradient
   in pressure and flow rate. In summary, CP with deterministic guidance of
   the filling front enables precise and robust control of flow rate and
   volume.}},

Abstract = {{Variable stiffness laminates can be manufactured using curvilinear fiber
   paths. A curvilinear fiber path is generally defined based on the plate
   size and has a curvature that is dependent on the plate size. In
   practice, however, the fiber path must satisfy manufacturing
   constraints, such as the minimum turning radius imposed by the automated
   fiber placement machine, thereby limiting the possible amount of fiber
   steering. In this work, we studied the effect of the plate size on the
   structural properties of a plate manufactured with curvilinear fibers.
   We considered four plate sizes, which were designed by a constant
   curvature fiber path. We optimized the plates for both maximum buckling
   load and in-plane stiffness. The results showed that the in-plane
   stiffness of the plate was not controlled by the plate size, whereas the
   buckling load was highly affected by the curvature of the fiber path.
   Hence, the potential of a buckling load increase reduced for plate sizes
   smaller than the minimum turning radius. In addition, for a given
   maximum curvature of the fiber path, the influence of a complex layup on
   the buckling load was marginal.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of isolated traffic calming measures and
   area-wide calming schemes on air quality in a dense neighborhood were
   estimated using a combination of microscopic traffic simulation,
   emission, and dispersion modeling. Results indicated that traffic
   calming measures did not have as large an effect on nitrogen dioxide
   (NO2) concentrations as the effect observed on nitrogen oxide (NOx)
   emissions. Changes in emissions resulted in highly disproportional
   changes in pollutant levels due to daily meteorological conditions, road
   geometry and orientation with respect to the wind. Average NO2 levels
   increased between 0.1\% and 10\% with respect to the base-case while
   changes in NO emissions varied between 5\% and 160\%. Moreover, higher
   wind speeds decreased NO2 concentrations on both sides of the roadway.
   Among the traffic calming measures, speed bumps produced the highest
   increases in NO2 levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of climate change on crop production and nitrate-nitrogen
   (NO3-N) pollution from subsurface drained fields is of a great concern.
   Using the calibrated and validated RZWQM2 (coupled with CERES-Maize and
   CROPGRO in DSSAT), the potential effects of climate change and elevated
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations (CO2) on tile drainage volume, NO3-N
   losses, and crop production were assessed integrally for the first time
   for a corn-soybean rotation cropping system near Gilmore City, Iowa.
   RZWQM2 simulated results under 20-year observed historical weather data
   (1990-2009) and ambient CO2 were compared to those under 20-year
   projected future meteorological data (2045-2064) and elevated CO2, with
   all management practices unchanged. The results showed that, under the
   future climate, tile drainage, NO3-N loss and flow-weighted average
   NO3-N concentration (FWANC) increased by 4.2 cm year(-1) (+14.5 \%),
   11.6 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (+33.7 \%) and 2.0 mg L-1 (+16.4 \%),
   respectively. Yields increased by 875 kg ha(-1) (+28.0 \%) for soybean
   {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.] but decreased by 1380 kg ha(-1) (-14.7 \%)
   for corn (Zea mays L.). The yield of the C-3 soybean increased mostly
   due to CO2 enrichment but increased temperature had negligible effect.
   However, the yield of C-4 corn decreased largely because of fewer days
   to physiological maturity due to increased temperature and limited
   benefit of elevated CO2 to corn yield under subhumid climate. Relative
   humidity, short wave radiation and wind speed had small or negligible
   impacts on FWANC or grain yields. With the predicted trend, this study
   suggests that to mitigate NO3-N pollution from subsurface drained
   corn-soybean field in Iowa is a more challenging task in the future
   without changing current management practices. This study also
   demonstrates the advantage of an agricultural system model in assessing
   climate change impacts on water quality and crop production. Further
   investigation on management practice adaptation is needed.}},

Abstract = {{This brief presents a distributed deployment algorithm for a network of
   heterogeneous mobile agents to minimize a prescribed cost function. This
   function is concerned with the cost of serving the entire field by all
   agents, where the so called operation cost of different agents are not
   necessarily the same. The problem is investigated for the case where
   agents have different types of dynamics. Using a
   multiplicatively-weighted Voronoi diagram, the field is partitioned to
   smaller regions (one for each agent). A distributed coverage control law
   is then provided that guarantees the convergence of agents to the
   optimal configuration with respect to the above-mentioned cost function.
   The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by
   simulations and experiments on a testbed with two types of unmanned
   vehicles (aerial and ground).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two families of motion primitives for enabling fast,
   agile flight through a dense obstacle field. The first family of
   primitives consists of a time-delay dependent 3D circular path between
   two points in space and the control inputs required to fly the path. In
   particular, the control inputs are calculated using algebraic equations
   which depend on the flight parameters and the location of the waypoint.
   Moreover, the transition between successive maneuver states, where each
   state is defined by a unique combination of constant control inputs, is
   modeled rigorously as an instantaneous switch between the two maneuver
   states following a time delay which is directly related to the agility
   of the robotic aircraft. The second family consists of aggressive
   turn-around (ATA) maneuvers which the robot uses to retreat from
   impenetrable pockets of obstacles. The ATA maneuver consists of an
   orchestrated sequence of three sets of constant control inputs. The
   duration of the first segment is used to optimize the ATA for the
   spatial constraints imposed by the turning volume. The motion primitives
   are validated experimentally and implemented in a simulated receding
   horizon control (RHC)-based motion planner. The paper concludes with
   inverse-design pointers derived from the primitives.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic materials is experiencing a
   research and commercialization craze in almost all industrial sectors.
   However, to date, AM has been limited to a small numbers of alloys. With
   respect to aluminum, two alloys received some attention: Al-12Si and
   Al-10Si-1Mg. In both cases, fully dense components have been achieved
   using a continuous-wave selective laser melting system. In this article,
   a new approach of selective laser melting using a pulsed-laser source as
   opposed to a continuous-wave laser is proposed. Pulse selective laser
   melting (P-SLM) would allow for greater control over the heat input and
   thus further optimization possibilities of the microstructure. P-SLM was
   demonstrated using the Al-12Si system. Si refinement below 200 nm was
   achieved throughout the component. Density up to 95\% and high hardness
   of above 135 HV were obtained. The solidification mechanism is also

Abstract = {{The elastodynamic analysis of a two-limb Schonflies motion generators is
   the subject of this paper. This analysis calls for the calculation of
   the stiffness and mass matrices. By resorting to the generalized spring
   concept, the posture-dependent stiffness matrix of the robot is
   computed. With the motors locked, the motion caused by the flexible
   components leads to the robot mass matrix. The generalized springs help
   to simplify the model. Although this simplification filters out the
   higher natural frequencies, it eases the computation of the
   posture-dependent stiffness and mass matrices. This provides a valuable
   tool to simplify the evaluation of the robot performance from an
   elastodynamic point of view, while the robot executes a given task.
   Finally, the modal analysis of the McGill Schonflies motion generator,
   while executing a pick-and-place operation, is conducted; under these
   conditions, the evolution of the first six natural frequencies is
   obtained. The elastodynamic performance of the robot for the given task
   is assessed using the results of the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, active control of aeroelastic oscillations and the use of
   piezoelectric materials in vibration analysis and control of structures
   have been the subjects of many researches in air vehicle design. The
   present paper deals with the use of bonded piezoelectric sensors and
   actuators in control of aeroelastic oscillations of a cantilever plate
   under the effects of unsteady subsonic aerodynamic loading. The
   aerodynamic loading is calculated using a numerical panel method. The
   structural model of the plate undergoing small transverse oscillations
   is modeled using finite element formulation. The aerodynamic and
   structural models are coupled through an interactive computer model to
   transfer the data simultaneously and an active feedback control is
   applied to suppress the oscillations. A systematic method is also
   presented to obtain the gains of the feedback controller. The numerical
   results show that the controller can effectively reduce the amplitude of
   the oscillations in small amount of time and with small gains, hence
   lower cost.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the past few decades, several concepts for morphing wings have been
   proposed with the aim of improving the structural and aerodynamic
   performance of conventional aircraft wings. One of the most interesting
   challenges in the design of a morphing wing is represented by the skin,
   which needs to meet specific deformation requirements. In particular
   when morphing involves changes of cord or curvature, the skin is
   required to undergo large recoverable deformation in the actuation
   direction, while maintaining the desired shape and strength in the
   others. One promising material concept that can meet these
   specifications is represented by lattice materials. This paper examines
   the use of alternative planar lattices in the embodiment of a skin panel
   for cord and camber morphing of an aircraft wing. We use a structural
   homogenization scheme capable of capturing large geometric nonlinearity,
   to examine the structural performance of lattice skin concepts, as well
   as to tune their mechanical properties in desired directions.}},

Abstract = {{Jamaica's water resources are under increasing risk of degradation and
   depletion, especially in light of increasing population growth,
   urbanization, and climate change. In this study, the soil and water
   assessment tool (SWAT) was used to simulate the hydrologic
   characteristics of the Rio Nuevo watershed in Jamaica to assess
   streamflow availability for irrigation supply during dry periods.
   Approximately 85\% of the watershed consists of aquiclude rock material,
   thus resulting in low potential for interaction between surface and
   groundwater. Historical climatic data (precipitation and temperature)
   were obtained for the watershed, and streamflow data were obtained for
   the Rio Nuevo, which drains the watershed. The model was calibrated over
   the period 2002-2004, and validated using the period 2005-2007. This
   paper outlines the parameterization of SWAT for the Rio Nuevo watershed
   and describes the potential for its use in agricultural water scarcity
   management in Jamaica. A Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient of
   0.76 was obtained for calibration, whereas a coefficient of 0.50 was
   obtained for validation. Results indicate that in drought periods, the
   stream cannot supply the necessary water needed for the agricultural
   areas. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   Application}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The feasibility of making slag-bonded construction wallboard through
   carbon dioxide activation of steel slag was investigated. The steel slag
   used in the study is a by-product of the Klockner Oxygen Blown Maxhutte
   (KOBM) steel-making process. The CO2-activated steel slag can
   potentially be used as a cementing material in place of ordinary
   portland cement (OPC). The 2-h carbonation strength of the activated
   steel slag reached 46MPa and the 28-day strength after carbonation and
   hydration was more than 60MPa. Carbonation of steel slag enabled CO2
   utilization up to 6.8\% on a dry-slag-mass basis. The high early
   strength obtained in CO2-activated slag is attributed to the rapid
   formation of calcium-silicate-hydrates and calcium carbonates. The
   precipitation of rhombohedral CaCO3 nanoparticles significantly enhances
   packing density and reduces the porosity of the carbonate matrix. A
   slag-bonded wallboard using sawdust as lightweight filler was
   successfully fabricated and its mechanical performance was comparable to
   cement-based commercial products.}},

Abstract = {{Aging and some pathologies such as arterial hypertension, diabetes,
   hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia cause some geometrical and
   mechanical changes in the aortic valve microstructure which contribute
   to the development of aortic stenosis (AS). Because of the high rate of
   mortality and morbidity, assessing the impact and progression of this
   disease is essential. Systolic transvalvular pressure gradient (TPG) and
   the effective orifice area are commonly used to grade the severity of
   valvular dysfunction. In this study, a theoretical model of the
   transient viscous blood flow across the AS is derived by taking into
   account the aorta compliance. The derived relation of the new TPG is
   expressed in terms of clinically available surrogate variables
   (anatomical and hemodynamic data). The proposed relation includes
   empirical constants which need to be empirically determined. We used a
   numerical model including an anatomically 3D geometrical model of the
   aortic root including the sinuses of Valsalva for their identification.
   The relation was evaluated using clinical values of pressure drops for
   cases for which the modified Gorlin equation is problematic (low flow,
   low gradient AS).}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced gravity, or centrifugal, separators have revolutionised gold
   processing over the past decades, significantly increasing the recovery
   of fine (-100 mu m) free gold. One of the main drawbacks of centrifugal
   gravity concentrators is the large volume of water required (even if it
   is all recycled). With water becoming an ever increasingly important
   ``commodity{''}, reducing this is of importance both from an
   environmental and a monetary point of view. This work investigated
   operating a laboratory scale Knelson Concentrator with a dry feed and
   using air as the fluidising medium. The feed used was a synthetic
   mixture of tungsten and quartz, used to mimic a gold ore. The response
   surface method and central composite design techniques were used to
   design the experiments and to model the results, with the experimental
   variables being the bowl speed (G-Level), air fluidising pressure and
   the feed rate. The models corresponded well to the experimental results,
   indicating that for this experimental setup, the optimal conditions were
   a bowl G-Level of 40 G, a feed rate of 220 g/min and an air fluidising
   pressure of 8 psi. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Data imputation approaches for robust automatic speech recognition
   reconstruct noise corrupted spectral information by exploiting prior
   knowledge of the relationship between target speech and background
   through the use of spectrographic masks. Most of these approaches are
   model-based techniques that can only provide accurate estimates of the
   underlying clean speech when the characteristics of the noise corrupted
   features do not deviate from those of the model. Discrete wavelet
   transform (DWT) based de-noising methods can also be used for
   re-estimating the underlying clean speech from a noise corrupted signal,
   but often require that the background noise is stationary and modeled by
   a Gaussian distribution. A novel approach is presented here for
   incorporating the information derived from spectrographic masks in a
   DWT-based de-noising method. The spectrographic masks are used for
   deriving thresholds for de-noising wavelet domain coefficients making
   DWT based de-noising more suitable for non-stationary noise conditions.
   The results of an experimental study are presented to demonstrate the
   performance of DWT based data imputation relative to other established
   techniques on the Aurora 2 noisy speech recognition task. It will be
   shown that the proposed approach reduces the impact of model mismatch
   associated with parametric approaches and exploits the robustness of
   non-parametric wavelet de-noising approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Biosolids reduction model by return activated sludge ozonation was
   validated by simulating nitrification data compiled from our pilot-scale
   and the literature studies. Then, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA)
   was performed to identify influential and non-influential parameters for
   biosolids reduction efficiency, change in specific nitrification
   activity (SNA), and alteration to expected nitrification stability. In
   general, the model outputs were sensitive to operational and ozone
   reaction parameters, but not to biochemical parameters. For operational
   parameters, mainly temperature and initial solids retention time (SRT)
   influenced all model outputs. For biosolids reduction, increase in the
   degradability of the influent COD decreased the reduction efficiency.
   For SNA, the changes were highly dependent on the influent TKN/COD
   ratio. Our findings also imply that the stability of the nitrification
   process in ozonated systems should be enhanced at constant MLVSS for
   warm temperatures, but could be reduced at temperatures below 12 degrees
   C and aerated SRTs below 10 days. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Synergy between Activity Theory and goal/scenario modeling for
   requirements elicitation, analysis, and evolution}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{109-135}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Context: It is challenging to develop comprehensive, consistent,
   analyzable requirements models for evolving requirements. This is
   particularly critical for certain highly interactive types of
   socio-technical systems that involve a wide range of stakeholders with
   disparate backgrounds; system success is often dependent on how well
   local social constraints are addressed in system design.
   Objective: This paper describes feasibility research, combining a
   holistic social system perspective provided by Activity Theory (AT), a
   psychological paradigm, with existing system development methodologies
   and tools, specifically goal and scenario modeling.
   Method: AT is used to understand the relationships between a system, its
   stakeholders, and the system's evolving context. The User Requirements
   Notation (URN) is used to produce rigorous, analyzable specifications
   combining goal and scenario models. First, an AT language was developed
   constraining the framework for automation, second consistency heuristics
   were developed for constructing and analyzing combined AT/URN models,
   third a combined AT/URN methodology was developed, and consequently
   applied to a proof-of-concept system.
   Results: An AT language with limited tool support was developed, as was
   a combined AT/URN methodology. This methodology was applied to an
   evolving disease management system to demonstrate the feasibility of
   adapting AT for use in system development with existing methodologies
   and tools. Bi-directional transformations between the languages allow
   proposed changes in system design to be propagated to AT models for use
   in stakeholder discussions regarding system evolution.
   Conclusions: The AT framework can be constrained for use in requirements
   elicitation and combined with URN tools to provide system designs that
   include social system perspectives. The developed AT/URN methodology can
   help engineers to track the impact on system design due to requirement
   changes triggered by changes in the system's social context. The
   methodology also allows engineers to assess the impact of proposed
   system design changes on the social elements of the system context. (C)

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A geometrically non-linear theory is developed for shells of generic
   shape allowing for third-order thickness and shear deformation and
   rotary inertia by using eight parameters; geometric imperfections are
   also taken into account. The geometrically non-linear
   strain-displacement relationships are derived retaining full non-linear
   terms in all the 8 parameters, i.e. in-plane and transverse
   displacements, rotations of the normal and thickness deformation
   parameters; these relationships are presented in curvilinear
   coordinates, ready to be implemented in computer codes. Higher order
   terms in the transverse coordinate are retained in the derivation so
   that the theory is suitable also for thick laminated shells.
   Three-dimensional constitutive equations are used for linear elasticity.
   The theory is applied to circular cylindrical shells complete around the
   circumference and simply supported at both ends to study initially
   static finite deformation. Both radially distributed forces and
   displacement-dependent pressure are used as load and results for
   different shell theories are compared. Results show that a 6 parameter
   non-linear shell theory is quite accurate for isotropic shells. Finally,
   large-amplitude forced vibrations under harmonic excitation are
   investigated by using the new theory and results are compared to other
   available theories. The new theory with non-linearity in all the 8
   parameters is the only one to predict correctly the thickness
   deformation; it works accurately for both static and dynamics loads. (C)

Abstract = {{Compression moulding of randomly oriented strands (ROS) of thermoplastic
   composite is a process that enables the forming of complex shapes with
   keeping final properties close to that of continuous fibre composites.
   During forming several deformation mechanisms occur. In this paper we
   focus on the interstrand void content (ISVC) reduction: the squeezing of
   each single strand during compression enables filling of the gaps
   between strands. A modelling of this deformation mechanism was
   developed. The compaction is ruled by an ordinary differential equation
   that was solved numerically. The model was validated experimentally
   using an instrumented hot press with Carbon-PEEK prepreg strands. The
   model accurately predicted ISVC in four characteristic cases. Using the
   proposed model, the influence of several process and material parameters
   were investigated. Finally, a design chart giving the final ISVC for a
   wide range of pressure, strand geometry and part thickness, was
   constructed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A preliminary computational fluid flow model has been developed to
   simulate the magnetic braking of liquid steel on a water-cooled, rapidly
   moving, horizontal belt. The liquid steel issuing from the proposed

   during freezing. In this study, ANSYS Fluent 14.5 software was used to
   model the 3-D turbulent flow of liquid steel. A 288 core High
   Performance Computer cluster located at the McGill Metals Processing
   Centre was used for high-speed computation. The standard k-epsilon model
   was used to simulate the turbulence. Similarly, the magnetic induction
   method was used to calculate the induced heterogeneous magnetic field,
   from which the current density and electromagnetic forces produced were
   computed. The behavior of the proposed magnetic flow control was first
   validated against previous experimental work and was then applied to
   predict the performance of the proposed slot nozzle. The predicted
   results show that by applying a DC Magnetic brake to the proposed metal
   delivery system, near isokinetic conditions can be rapidly established.}},

Abstract = {{The near-surface hardness and residual stresses resulting from a single
   shot peening impingement on aluminum alloy 2024-T351 were assessed by
   nanoindentation with spatial mapping of mechanical properties on cross
   sections through an impingement. For residual stress, a procedure was
   developed to couple nanoindentation experiments with numerical
   simulations for better understanding and predicting the effects of shot
   peening. A surface preparation method was developed that exposes the
   cross section of a single shot impingement for nanoindentation tests,
   while at the same time obtaining accurate measurements of the
   impingement dimensions. Starting parameters for the numerical simulation
   in terms of shot diameter and the shot velocity were selected to best
   match measurements of the impingement depth and diameter. The
   experimental results indicated that the greatest hardness was located at
   the nearest indent to the peened surface, whereas the maximum
   compressive residual stress was located sub-surface. When comparing
   experimental and numerical residual stresses, the experimental results
   showed a greater maximum compressive residual stress that was in closer
   proximity to the peened surface. Overall, residual stress fields
   compared between experimental and numerical results were similar, and
   differences could be explained in terms of the effect of strain
   hardening. The current work demonstrated the usefulness of coupling
   nanoindentation experiments with numerical simulations for evaluating
   the surface modifications resulting from a single shot peening

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the comprehensive detailed concepts of the rotor
   broken bars fault in industrial induction motors. It reviews the most
   important and applicable techniques for fault detection, and addresses
   fault diagnosing procedures at different supply modes including
   line-start and inverter-fed modes. Moreover, new analytical and
   experimental aspects of fault are proposed using the time and frequency
   domain variations of the motor variables such as current, voltage,
   electromagnetic torque and speed. Since the faulty motor behavior cannot
   be correctly identified without considering the motor operating
   condition, and the capability of the previous fault indicators are
   studied deeply in order to investigate their applicability at different
   conditions. These conditions include various faults, load and reference
   speed levels and also fault location. All in all, a precise condition
   assessment of the rotor broken bar induction motors, suitable for
   industrial purposes, is presented considering motor supply and

Abstract = {{The surface micro- and nano-scale features produced by femtosecond laser
   irradiation on titanium, stainless steel, aluminum and copper are
   reported in this work. Each observed surface microstructure, which was
   fabricated from a particular combination of four adjustable parameters,
   can be characterized by the fluence and pulses-per-spot (F-PPS) and
   accumulated fluence profile (AFP) models. By performing a wide screening
   of the experimental space, we have successfully mapped the evolution of
   microstructures as a function of two variables per model. We have also
   shown that these two models, in conjunction with one another and the
   data that we have presented, can be used as an optimization tool for
   scientists and engineers to quickly fine-tune the laser processing
   settings necessary for a desired surface topography. In addition, the
   electron-phonon coupling strength and thermal conductivity have been
   identified as the material properties that have the largest influence
   over the achievable surface patterns on metallic substrates. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper is a study of microstructure and densification of a gas

   wt\%(Cr,Fe)(7)C-3 precipitates dispersed in a 34 wt-\% body centred
   cubic Fe based solid solution matrix containing Cr and Si. The powder
   was fully densified with solid state sintering for a short period of
   time (<10 min). After sintering, the phases did not transform, and the
   fraction, shape and aspect ratio of (Cr, Fe)(2)B did not change. In
   addition, we adapted the known SPS constitutive densification model from
   Olevsky and Froyen to include a microstructure factor describing
   deformation of a metal matrix composite powder. The model was in
   reasonable agreement with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{The central objective of this research was to assess the effects of
   temperature and particle size on the spark plasma sintering (SPS)
   response of two prealloyed aluminium powders atomised from wrought
   alloys AA 2024 and AA 7075. A SPS temperature of 400 degrees C was found
   to yield fully dense specimens of both alloys with hardness values that
   were comparable to the starting wrought ingot materials. Such samples
   also exhibited appreciably lower concentrations of residual oxygen and
   hydrogen when compared to those present in the raw powders. Degassing
   experiments completed through thermogravimetric analyser (TGA)-gas
   chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) indicated that the release of
   CO2 and adsorbed/chemisorbed H2O were responsible for the enhanced
   purity of the SPS products. Particle size was also a factor of influence
   with the most favourable results for density and minimised O/H
   concentrations achieved with particles >= 180 mu m in diameter.}},

Title = {{Socioeconomic status and environmental noise exposure in Montreal,
   Canada}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study's objective was to determine whether
   socioeconomically deprived populations are exposed to greater levels of
   environmental noise.
   Methods: Indicators of socioeconomic status were correlated with LAeq24h
   noise levels estimated with a land-use regression model at a small
   geographic scale.
   Results: We found that noise exposure was associated with all
   socioeconomic indicators, with the strongest correlations found for
   median household income, proportion of people who spend over 30\% of
   their income on housing, proportion of people below the low income
   boundary and with a social deprivation index combining several
   socio-economic variables.
   Conclusion: Our results were inconsistent with a number of studies
   performed elsewhere, indicating that locally conducted studies are
   imperative to assessing whether this double burden of noise exposure and
   low socioeconomic status exists in other contexts. The primary
   implication of our study is that noise exposure represents an
   environmental injustice in Montreal, which is an issue that merits both
   investigation and concern.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Copper ions represent a promising angiogenic agent but are associated
   with cytotoxicity at elevated concentrations. Phosphate-based glasses
   (PGs) exhibit adjustable dissolution properties and allow for controlled
   ion release. This study examined the formation of capillary-like
   networks by SVEC4-10 endothelial cells (ECs) seeded in a
   three-dimensional (3D) type I collagen hydrogel matrix mixed with PG
   particles of the formulation 50P(2)O(5)-30CaO-(20-x) Na2O-xCuO (x = 0
   and 10 mol\%). Copper and total phosphorus release decreased over time
   and was more sustained in the case of 10\% CuO PG. Moreover, increasing
   the concentration of 10\% CuO PG in collagen substantially delayed
   dissolution along with preferential release of copper. A 3D morphometric
   characterization method based on confocal laser scanning microscopy
   image stacks was developed in order to quantify EC network length,
   connectivity and branching. Network length was initially reduced in a
   concentration-dependent fashion by 10\% CuO PG and, to a lesser extent,
   by 0\% CuO PG, but reached values identical to the non-PG control by day
   5 in culture. This reduction was attributed to a PG-mediated decrease in
   cell metabolic activity while cell proliferation as well as network
   connectivity and branching were independent of PG content. Gene
   expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1 and -2 was up-regulated
   by PGs, indicating that MMPs did not play a critical role in network
   growth. The relationship between ion release and EC morphogenesis in 3D
   provided in this study is expected to contribute to an ultimately
   successful pro-angiogenic application of CuO-doped PGs. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Interest has grown in tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB)
   semi-clathrates due to their formation at lower pressures and higher
   temperatures than conventional gas hydrates. This study focuses on TBAB
   semi-clathrates formed with carbon dioxide and methane and is to our
   knowledge the first study to report and model semi-clathrate former
   solubility under hydrate-liquid-vapor equilibrium conditions. A
   thermodynamic model was developed using the Trebble-Bishnoi equation of
   state to calculate vapor and liquid phase fugacity. Liquid activity was
   determined using the electrolyte non-random two liquid model (eNRTL).
   The solid semi-clathrate phase was modeled using a modified van der
   Waals-Platteeuw model (vdW-P), with parameters re-optimized based on the
   data obtained in this study. Equilibrium conditions were successfully
   modeled over the temperature range of 281-294 K, pressure range of
   377-11,000 kPa and TBAB composition range of 5-40 wt\%. The model
   functioned well for carbon dioxide with an average absolute relative
   error (AARE) of 4.7\% for pressure prediction and an AARE of 17.5\% for
   solubility. Methane was more difficult to model and yielded AAREs of
   21.6\% for pressure and 32.5\% for solubility. Further understanding of
   semi-clathrate crystal structure and interactions between methane and
   TBAB would aid in improving the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{337}},
Pages = {{244-262}},
Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{This contribution addresses the vibratory analysis of unilateral-contact
   induced structural interactions between a bladed impeller and its
   surrounding rigid casing. Such assemblies can be found in helicopter or
   small aircraft engines for instance and the interactions of interest
   shall arise due to the always tighter operating clearances between the
   rotating and stationary components. The investigation is conducted by
   extending to cyclically symmetric structures an in-house time-marching
   based tool dedicated to unilateral contact occurrences in turbomachines.
   The main components of the considered impeller together with the
   associated assumptions and modelling principles considered in this work
   are detailed. Typical dynamical features of cyclically symmetric
   structures, such as the abasing effect and frequency clustering are
   explored in this nonlinear framework by means of thorough
   frequency-domain analyses and harmonic trackings of the numerically
   predicted impeller displacements. Additional contact maps highlight the
   existence of critical rotational velocities at which displacements
   potentially reach high amplitudes due to the synchronization of the
   bladed assembly vibratory pattern with the shape of the rigid casing.
   The proposed numerical investigations are also compared to a simpler and
   (almost) empirical criterion: it is suggested, based on nonlinear
   numerical simulations with a linear reduced order model of the impeller
   and a rigid casing, that this criterion may miss important critical
   velocities emanating from the unfavorable combination of aliasing and
   contact-induced higher harmonics in the vibratory response of the
   impeller. Overall, this work suggests a way to enhance guidelines to
   improve the design of impellers in the context of nonlinear and
   nonsmooth dynamics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   fundamental bottleneck of deep ultraviolet light sources}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{Despite broad interest in aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN)
   optoelectronic devices for deep ultraviolet (DUV) applications, the
   performance of conventional Al(Ga)N planar devices drastically decays
   when approaching the AlN end, including low internal quantum
   efficiencies (IQEs) and high device operation voltages. Here we show
   that these challenges can be addressed by utilizing nitrogen (N) polar
   Al(Ga)N nanowires grown directly on Si substrate. By carefully tuning
   the synthesis conditions, a record IQE of 80\% can be realized with
   N-polar AlN nanowires, which is nearly ten times higher compared to high
   quality planar AlN. The first 210 nm emitting AlN nanowire light
   emitting diodes (LEDs) were achieved, with a turn on voltage of about 6
   V, which is significantly lower than the commonly observed 20 - 40 V.
   This can be ascribed to both efficient Mg doping by controlling the
   nanowire growth rate and N-polarity induced internal electrical field
   that favors hole injection. In the end, high performance N-polar AlGaN
   nanowire LEDs with emission wavelengths covering the UV-B/C bands were
   also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The Stiffness Damage Test (SDT) is an interesting tool for assessing
   damage in concrete affected by alkali-silica reaction (ASR). It has been
   found that the use of a fixed loading over the test limits its ability
   to reliably appraise the distress level of concrete samples, mainly when
   different concrete strengths and aggregate types are used. However,
   there is currently very limited data on the influence of various input
   parameters on the test responses. This paper thus presents a critical
   evaluation of several input parameters of the SDT. Parameters such as
   the core's environmental conditions, the samples' characteristics and
   the samples conditioning history seem to influence significantly the
   cyclic test output results. Otherwise, different types of surface
   preparation and the specimens' size (i.e. specimens' diameter) did not
   seem to clearly modify the test analyses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Employing density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the
   generalized-stacking-fault energy (GSFE) curves along two
   crystallographic slips, glide and shuffle, for both pristine graphene
   and impurity of boron (B) or nitrogen (N) doped graphene were examined.
   The effects of B and N doping on the GSFE were clarified and correlated
   with local electron interactions and bonding configurations. The GSFE
   data were then used to analyze dislocation dipole and core structure and
   subsequently combined with the PeierlsNabarro (PN) model to examine the
   role of doping on several key characteristics of dislocations in
   graphene. We showed that the GSFE curve may be significantly altered by
   the presence of dopants, which subsequently leads to profound
   modulations of dislocation properties, such as increasing spontaneous
   pair-annihilation distance and reducing resistance to dislocation slip.
   Our results indicate that doping can play an important role in
   controlling dislocation density and microscopic plasticity in graphene,
   thereby providing critical insights for dopant-mediated defect
   engineering in graphene.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the multiscale mechanism of collapse of
   hemicylindrical annular surface macrocavities in steel caused by
   high-strain, high-strain rate plastic flow of copper. Experiments and
   simulations revealed that a two-stage process is responsible for the
   observed microjetting phenomena: the formation of lateral copper
   microjets from the localized shear flow in copper at the interface
   during the filling of the cavity, and their subsequent collision at the
   apex of the macrocavity generating two additional horizontal microjets.
   The lengths of these microjets were an order of magnitude smaller than
   the cavity size but linearly scaled with the cavity radius. This process
   of microjet development is sensitive to the cavity geometry and is
   unlike the previously observed jetting phenomena in cavitation, impact
   crater collapse, or shock-induced cavity collapse.}},

Title = {{Hybrid model of the context dependent vestibulo-ocular reflex:
   implications for vergence-version interactions}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 9}},
Abstract = {{The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is an involuntary eye movement evoked
   by head movements. It is also influenced by viewing distance. This paper
   presents a hybrid nonlinear bilateral model for the horizontal angular
   vestibulo-ocular reflex (AVOR) in the dark. The model is based on known
   interconnections between saccadic burst circuits in the brainstem and
   ocular premotor areas in the vestibular nuclei during fast and slow
   phase intervals of nystagmus. We implemented a viable switching strategy
   for the timing of nystagmus events to allow emulation of real nystagmus
   data. The performance of the hybrid model is evaluated with simulations,
   and results are consistent with experimental observations. The hybrid
   model replicates realistic AVOR nystagmus patterns during sinusoidal or
   step head rotations in the dark and during interactions with vergence,
   e.g., fixation distance. By simply assigning proper nonlinear neural
   computations at the premotor level, the model replicates all reported
   experimental observations. This work sheds light on potential underlying
   neural mechanisms driving the context dependent AVOR and explains
   contradictory results in the literature. Moreover, context-dependent
   behaviors in more complex motor systems could also rely on local
   nonlinear neural computations.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the trapping ability of the Gunther Tulip and Celect

   filters were tested in vitro in horizontal position with thrombus
   diameters of 3 and 6 mm and tube diameter of 19 mm. The filters were
   tested in centered and tilted positions. Sets of 30 clots were injected
   into the model and the same process was repeated 20 times for each
   different condition simulated. Pressure drop experienced along the
   system was also measured and the percentage of clots captured was
   recorded. The Gunther Tulip filter showed superiority in all cases,
   trapping almost 100\% of 6 mm clots both in an eccentric and tilted
   position and trapping 81.7\% of the 3 mm clots in a centered position
   and 69.3\% in a maximum tilted position. The efficiency of all filters
   tested decreased as the size of the embolus decreased and as the filter
   was tilted. The injection of 6 clots raised the pressure drop to 4.1
   mmHg, which is a reasonable value that does not cause the obstruction of
   blood flow through the system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The present study introduced a novel chaotic coil heat exchanger
   utilizing chaotic advection to enhance heat transfer at low Reynolds

   sensitivity to the initial condition and fluid element calculations, it
   was shown that mixing was significantly increased due to the chaotic
   advection. Heat transfer performance in the coil and chaotic
   configuration was visualized by isotherms contours of temperature in
   different cross-sections. In order to evaluate the hydraulic-thermal
   performance of heat exchangers, Nusselt numbers and friction factor were
   calculated and comparison was made between the two configurations.
   Numerical calculations revealed that the chaotic coil configuration
   displayed heat transfer enhancement of 4-26\% relative to the fully
   developed Nusselt numbers in the regular coil with only 5-8\% change in
   the pressure drop. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Actin filaments propelled in vitro by groups of skeletal muscle myosin
   motors exhibit distinct phases of active sliding or arrest, whose
   occurrence depends on actin length (L) within a range of up to 1.0 mu m.
   Smooth muscle myosin filaments are exponentially distributed with
   approximate to 150 nm average length in vivo-suggesting relevance of the
   L-dependence of myosin group kinetics. Here, we found L-dependent actin
   arrest and sliding in in vitro motility assays of smooth muscle myosin.
   We perturbed individual myosin kinetics with varying, physiological
   concentrations of phosphate (P-i, release associated with main power
   stroke) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP, release associated with minor
   mechanical step). Adenosine triphosphate was kept constant at
   physiological concentration. Increasing {[}P-i] lowered the fraction of
   time for which actin was actively sliding, reflected in reduced average
   sliding velocity (upsilon) and motile fraction (f(mot), fraction of time
   that filaments are moving); increasing {[}ADP] increased the fraction of
   time actively sliding and reduced the velocity while sliding, reflected
   in reduced upsilon and increased f(mot). We introduced specific P-i and
   ADP effects on individual myosin kinetics into our recently developed
   mathematical model of actin propulsion by myosin groups. Simulations
   matched our experimental observations and described the inhibition of
   myosin group kinetics. At low {[}P-i] and {[}ADP], actin arrest and
   sliding were reflected by two distinct chemical states of the myosin
   group. Upon {[}P-i] increase, the probability of the active state
   decreased; upon {[}ADP] increase, the probability of the active state
   increased, but the active state became increasingly similar to the
   arrested state.}},

Abstract = {{The method of weighted residuals can efficiently enforce time-periodic
   solutions of flexible structures experiencing unilateral contact. The
   harmonic balance method (HBM) based on Fourier expansion of the sought
   solution is a common formulation, although wavelet bases that can
   sparsely define nonsmooth solutions may be superior. This hypothesis is
   investigated using a full three-dimensional blade with unilateral
   contact conditions on a set of N-c discrete contact points located at
   its tip. The unilateral contact conditions are first regularized, and a
   distributional formulation in time is introduced, allowing L2(S1)N trial
   functions to properly approximate in the time domain the solution to the
   governing equations. The mixed wavelet Petrov-Galerkin solutions are
   found to yield consistent or better results than HBM, with higher
   convergence rates and seemingly more accurate contact force prediction.

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study is to investigate the geometrically
   nonlinear size-dependent bending as well as resonant behaviour over the
   bent state of a microarch under an axial load. In particular, an axial
   load is applied on the system causing the initial curvature to increase
   by giving rise to a new bent configuration. A distributed harmonic
   transverse force is then exerted on the microarch and the nonlinear
   resonant response of the system over the new deflected configuration is
   investigated. The nonlinear partial differential equation of motion is
   obtained via Hamilton's principle based on the modified couple stress
   theory. The equation is discretized into a set of nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations through use of the Galerkin scheme. The
   pseudo-arclength continuation technique is then applied to the resultant
   set of ordinary differential equations. First, for the unforced system
   in the transverse direction, the axial load is increased and the new
   deflected configuration of the system is plotted versus the axial
   compression load; the nonlinear resonant response over the deflected
   configuration is then investigated through constructing
   frequency-response and force-response curves. (C) 2014 Politechnika

Abstract = {{Virtualization and service-oriented architecture are important concepts
   that triggered the rapid evolution of cloud computing and
   software-defined technologies. Since wireless technologies will play an
   important role in the future of networking technologies, this article
   presents Aurora, a virtualization framework and testbed platform for
   supporting multiple types of virtualization techniques and architectures
   specifically applied to wireless technologies. Firstly, a brief
   background overview of the three main perspectives of wireless
   virtualization based on the type of virtualized resources and the depth
   of slicing is provided along with some of the challenges and
   requirements for a sustainable and generic wireless virtualization
   framework. Secondly, the software architecture and the design principles
   behind Aurora are explained. Aurora is designed to fulfil multiple roles
   as a powerful tool to combine multiple wireless virtualization
   technologies, a software-defined research platform for developing new
   virtualization architectures and a service-oriented wireless
   infrastructure manager. Lastly, an instance of the software
   implementation of Aurora is presented in order to demonstrate the
   feasibility of deployment of the framework.}},

   reaction rate and yielding confinement}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The propagation of detonation waves in reactive media bounded by an
   inert, compressible layer is examined via computational simulations in
   two different geometries, axisymmetric cylinders, and two dimensional,
   planar slabs. For simplicity, an ideal gas equation of state is used
   with a pressure-dependent reaction rate that results in a detonation
   wave structure that does not exhibit cellular instability. The
   detonation is initiated as an ideal Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) detonation with
   a one-dimensional structure, and then allowed to propagate into a finite
   diameter or thickness layer of explosive surrounded by an inert layer.
   The yielding confinement of the inert layer results in the detonation
   wave decaying to a sub-CJ steady state velocity or failing entirely.
   Simulations are performed with different values of the reaction rate
   pressure exponent (n = 2 and 3) and different impedance confinement
   (greater than, less than, and equal to that of the explosive). The
   velocity decrement and critical dimension (critical diameter or
   thickness) are determined, and a 2: 1 scaling between the cylinder
   diameter and slab thickness results is confirmed, in good agreement with
   curvature-based models of detonation propagation. The measured shock
   front curvature and detonation velocity relation (D-N-kappa) agrees with
   the classic model of Wood and Kirkwood. The computational simulations
   are compared to a simple, analytic model that treats the interaction of
   the confinement with the detonation products via Newtonian theory and a
   model that assumes a continuous variation in shock front curvature with
   the shock angle at the interface with the confinement matching the angle
   determined by shock polar analysis. The Newtonian model works very well
   for the case of high impedance confinement, while the shock front
   curvature model agrees with the simulations for the case of low
   impedance confinement. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Many dental devices, such as partial dentures, combine
   acrylic and metallic parts that are bonded together. These devices often
   present catastrophic mechanical failures due to weak bonding between
   their acrylic and metallic components. The bonding between alloys and
   polymers (e. g. poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA) usually is just a
   mechanical interlock, since they do not chemically bond spontaneously.
   The aim of this study was to develop a new method to make a strong
   chemical bond between alloys and polymers for dental prostheses based on
   diazonium chemistry.
   Methods. The method was based on two steps. In the first step (primer),
   aryldiazonium salts were grafted onto the metallic surfaces. The second
   step (adhesive) was optimized to achieve covalent binding between the
   grafted layer and PMMA. The chemical composition of the treated surfaces
   was analyzed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the
   tensile or shear bonding strength between metals and poly(methyl
   methacrylate) was measured.
   Results. XPS and contact angle measurements confirmed the presence of a
   polymer coating on the treated metallic surfaces. Mechanical tests
   showed a significant increase in bond strength between PMMA and treated
   titanium or stainless steel wire by 5.2 and 2.5 folds, respectively,
   compared to the untreated control group (p<0.05).
   Significance. Diazonium chemistry is an effective technique for
   achieving a strong chemical bond between alloys and PMMA, which can help
   improve the mechanical properties of dental devices. (C) 2014 Academy of

   Current paper shows the impact of different improvements on reducing
   cooling load of buildings in hot climate. The examined factors are (1)
   total heat transfer coefficient of the external shell, (2) indoor
   temperature, (3) lighting efficacy. For this purpose, a common type of
   residential house in Qatar was chosen as a case study. The cooling load
   was estimated using simulation model. The simulations show that there is
   big potential to reduce the cooling requirements in Qatar up to 46\%. A
   brief economic comparison between the examined factors was done. The
   economic analysis shows that the payback time of applying the examined
   factors fall between 0.5 and 2 years. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation of the effect of
   hydrogen purging time period and duration on the performance of a proton
   exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack with a dead-end anode. The
   objective is to develop a better understanding of the interactions
   between the purging parameters and the cathode air-stoichiometry. It
   employs a full factorial approach for three factors (purging period,
   purging duration and air-stoichiometry) with two levels and three
   replications. The study is performed on a 300 cm(2), 24-cell PEM fuel
   cell stack with the rated power of 1.5 kW. The stack was operated with
   water cooling, fully humidified air and dry hydrogen at the ambient
   pressure. The results showed that the stack performance is significantly
   influenced by the interactions of the purging parameters and the cathode
   air-stoichiometry. The least square model was utilized to determine the
   optimum values of these parameters with regard to the stack performance
   and hydrogen utilization. For the present stack, the optimum values of
   parameters were: purging period of 3 min, purging duration of 4 s and
   the cathode air-stoichiometry of 200\%.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical modelling is a vital tool in the mining industry and is widely
   used for planning purposes as well as for examining phenomena on a
   mine-wide scale. In this paper, a comprehensive rock mechanics study is
   conducted for the planned mining sequence within an orebody that leads
   to the formation of a diminishing ore pillar at the Vale Garson Mine in
   Sudbury, Ontario. A mine-wide numerical model is first constructed in
   FLAC(3D) with input parameters derived from laboratory tests and
   borehole log data, and is then calibrated based on in-situ stress
   measurements. The planned mining sequence scenario, comprising mining
   fronts advancing from the eastern and western sides of the orebody, is
   examined based on a combined numerical-volumetric analysis. A
   qualitative assessment of ``ore at risk{''} is first made based on two
   instability indicators; the brittle shear ratio (BSR) and major
   principal stress (sigma(1)). In addition, two other sequence scenarios
   are examined in which mining is accelerated in the east. A quantitative
   comparison of the results is then made for the three options using the
   same instability indicators. Based on the optimum sequence scenario, an
   assessment is conducted of effects emanating from variations in
   constitutive models and the presence of a shear zone. In the final
   phase, the BSI? and the presence of tensile conditions are used as
   instability indicators to study the volume of ``ore at risk{''} in
   snipes adjacent to an opening during a mining stage. It is shown that
   the proposed methodology, while simple, can nevertheless be a powerful
   tool for the planning and validation of stope extraction sequence
   scenarios, and can be used in conjunction with multiple stability
   indicators. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{Coronary bifurcation lesions are complex. Whether a critical condition
   exists in the stenotic side branch (SB) of bifurcation lesions,
   according to the Medina classification, is unassessed. Computational
   models of coronary bifurcations were developed with different stenosis
   severities and locations, in order to study the flow distribution and
   wall shear stress (WSS) in the SB. It was found that bifurcation lesion
   type (1,0,1) had a flow ratio of 0.25, much less than the corresponding
   normal ratio of 0.47, and the 0.46 and 0.39 ratios computed for lesion
   types (0,1,1) and (1,1,1), respectively. Bifurcation type (1,0,1) was
   associated with a 47\% reduction from normal coronary flow, resulting in
   coronary branch steal. Blood flow to the SB decreased as the stenosis
   severity increased and approached the carina, in the proximal, distal,
   and side branches. Similarly, WSS values decreased with increasing
   stenosis severity. Bifurcation type (1,0,1) had the lowest WSS values in
   the SB, and were below the 0.5 Pa threshold for atherosclerotic growth.
   In conclusion, the results suggest that lesion type (1,0,1) is at the
   greatest risk of coronary branch steal, leading to potential ischemia,
   as well as further atherosclerotic growth. This is counterintuitive to
   the Medina classification, where bifurcation type (1,1,1) is usually
   considered the most severe. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine the axisymmetric adhesive contact problem for
   a rigid circular plate and an incompressible elastic halfspace where the
   linear elastic shear modulus varies exponentially with depth. The
   analytical solution of the mixed boundary value problem entails a set of
   coupled integral equations that cannot be solved easily by conventional
   integral transform techniques proposed in the literature. In this paper,
   we adopt a computational scheme where the contact normal and contact
   shear stress distributions are approximated by their discretized
   equivalents. The consideration of compatibility of deformations due to
   the indentation by a rigid indenter in adhesive contact gives a set of
   algebraic equations that yield the discretized equivalents of the
   contacts stresses and the axial stiffness of the medium.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we consider a two-way relay channel where two source
   nodes exchange their packets via a half-duplex relay node, which adopts
   physical-layer network coding (PNC) for exchanging packets in two time
   slots. Convolutional codes (CCs) are assumed to be applied as a channel
   code for each packet. The relay node directly decodes the XORed version
   of packets of two source nodes in the multiple access (MA) phase. We
   first mathematically analyze a bit error rate (BER) of the MA phase in
   the PNC with CCs in Rayleigh fading channels. Then, we propose a power
   allocation (PA) strategy for minimizing the derived BER expression at
   the relay node. It is shown that the proposed transmit power solution
   satisfies the following relationship: P-1{*}/P-2{*} = root
   Omega(2)/Omega(1), where P-i{*} and Omega(i) denote the optimal power of
   the ith source node and the variance of the channel gains between the
   ith source node and the relay node. The proposed PA strategy
   significantly outperforms conventional PA schemes in terms of the BER.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce interference to primary user and improve channel capacity with
   an acceptable detection probability in cognitive radio networks, we
   propose a relay-based cooperative spectrum sensing framework. Different
   from conventionally cognitive radio network, where spectrum sensing and
   signal transmission are performed separately, the proposed framework
   integrates spectrum sensing into signal transmission by assigning
   different signal types to primary user and cognitive users, i.e.,
   sinusoidal signal and chirp signals for primary user and cognitive
   users, respectively. Thanks to the energy concentration property of
   chirp signals in the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) domain, the
   separation of primary user and cognitive users can be realized easily.
   In this proposed framework, interference to primary user can be reduced
   because of the simplified time slot structure, and channel capacity can
   also be improved by removing the separate spectrum sensing process.
   Moreover, by using the energy accumulation of the primary user in the
   signal transmission process, the detection probability of the proposed
   framework can also be improved even with channel estimation error and
   signal separation error.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates optimal power allocation schemes at the relay
   and their impact on the error performance for a full-duplex, dual-hop,
   amplify-and-forward system using finite constellations and under
   residual self-interference. The variance of the interference is assumed
   to be proportional to the lambda-h power of the transmitted power. The
   worst-case pairwise error probability (PEP) is considered as the
   performance criterion. To find the optimal power allocation, we first
   derive a closed-form expression for the derivative of the PEP. A simple
   bisection method is then applied to obtain the optimal scheme. An
   asymptotically optimal allocation in closed form is also obtained
   assuming high power regions. From this analysis, it is shown that power
   allocation leads to a better diversity performance than full power
   transmission. In addition, the error floor behavior observed in previous
   works can be eliminated through power allocation. Numerical results are
   finally presented to illustrate the advantage of the proposed scheme
   over full power usage.}},

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet laser radiation has been adopted in a wide range of
   applications as diverse as water purification, flexible displays, data
   storage, sterilization, diagnosis and bioagent detection(1-3). Success
   in developing semiconductor-based, compact ultraviolet laser sources,

   disordered AlGaN core-shell nanowire arrays, formed directly on a Si
   substrate, can be used to achieve highly stable, electrically pumped
   lasers across the entire ultraviolet AII (UV-AII) band (similar to
   320-340 nm) at low temperatures. The laser threshold is in the range of
   tens of amps per centimetre squared, which is nearly three orders of
   magnitude lower than those of previously reported quantum-well
   lasers(4-6). This work also reports the first demonstration of
   electrically injected AlGaN-based ultraviolet lasers monolithically
   grown on a Si substrate, and offers a new avenue for achieving
   semiconductor lasers in the ultraviolet B (UV-B) (280-320 nm) and

Abstract = {{The fundamental combustion and emissions properties of advanced biofuels
   are reviewed, and their impact on engine performance is discussed, in
   order to guide the selection of optimal conversion routes for obtaining
   desired fuel combustion properties. Advanced biofuels from second- and
   third-generation feedstocks can result in significantly reduced
   life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions, compared to traditional fossil
   fuels or first-generation bioftiels from food-based feedstocks. These
   advanced biofuels include alcohols, biodiesel, or synthetic hydrocarbons
   obtained either from hydrotreatment of oxygenated biofuels or from
   Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The engine performance and exhaust pollutant
   emissions of advanced biofuels are linked to their fundamental
   combustion properties, which can be modeled using combustion
   chemical-kinetic mechanisms and surrogate fuel blends. In general,
   first-generation or advanced biofuels perform well in existing
   combustion engines, either as blend additives with petro-fuels or as
   pure ``drop-in{''} replacements. Generally, oxygenated biofuels produce
   lower intrinsic nitric-oxide and soot emissions than hydrocarbon fuels
   in fundamental experiments, but engine-test results can be complicated
   by multiple factors. In order to reduce engine emissions and improve
   fuel efficiency, several novel technologies, including engines and fuel
   cells, are being developed. The future fuel requirements for a selection
   of such novel power-generation technologies, along with their potential
   performance improvements over existing technologies, are discussed. The
   trend in the biofuels and transportation industries appears to be moving
   towards drop-in fuels that require little changes in vehicle or fueling
   infrastructure, but this comes at a cost of reduced life-cycle
   efficiencies for the overall alternative-fuel production and utilization
   system. In the future, fuel-flexible, high-efficiency, and
   ultra-low-emissions heat-engine and fuel-cell technologies promise to
   enable consumers to switch to the lowest-cost and cleanest fuel
   available in their market at any given time. This would also enable
   society as a whole to maximize its global level of transportation
   activity, while maintaining urban air quality, within an energy- and
   carbon-constrained world. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology for on-line inertia parameters
   estimation for a rigid space debris captured by a tethered system, based
   on a new dynamics model of the system where the base satellite (chaser)
   and the space debris (target) are modeled as rigid bodies and the
   attachment points of the tether are offset from the centers of mass of
   the two bodies. Parameters estimation of unknown debris is critical for
   subsequent tasks in the space debris remediation mission, in particular,
   for debris retrieval and de-orbiting. In the proposed algorithm, the
   chaser and target are modeled as rigid bodies, the latter with unknown
   inertia parameters. Then, the parameters identification problem is
   formulated and solved in three phases. First, a coarse estimate of the
   target mass is obtained during the post-capture phase, while the length
   of tether is much longer than the offsets of base and target satellite,
   and the rigid body model is degenerated to a mass point model. Then,
   with a proper tension control scheme and the coarse estimate used as an
   initial guess, the debris is retrieved smoothly and a precise mass
   estimate is achieved during the first half of the retrieval. Finally,
   when the tether is retrieved relatively short and the rigid body model
   is used, moments of inertia and the offsets of the space debris will be
   estimated with a proper tension control scheme for rigid body model. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, Bioconversion process of glucose to fructose from date

   model was developed using an Eulerian - Eulerian approach to calculate
   the fructose volume fraction produced during time. The bioconversion
   process was studied as function of three initial concentration of
   glucose (0.14, 0.242 and 0.463 g L-1), three induction time (60, 120 and
   180 mn) and three inoculum volume (100, 120 and 150mL). The numerical
   results are compared with experimental data for bioconversion rate and
   show good agreement (R-2= 0.894). The optimal condition of diffusion was
   obtained by applying an initial concentration of glucose less than 0.2 g
   L-1 and induction time great than 100 minutes.}},

Abstract = {{The phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and associated vesicles
   (efferocytosis) by DCs is an important mechanism for both self tolerance
   and host defense. Although some of the engulfment ligands involved in
   efferocytosis have been identified and studied in vitro, the
   contributions of these ligands in vivo remain ill defined. Here, we
   determined that during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, the
   engulfment ligand annexin1 is an important mediator in DC
   cross-presentation that increases efferocytosis in DCs and intrinsically
   enhances the capacity of the DC antigen-presenting machinery.
   Annexin1-deficient mice were highly susceptible to Mtb infection and
   showed an impaired Mtb antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell response.
   Importantly, annexin1 expression was greatly downregulated in
   Mtb-infected human blood monocyte-derived DCs, indicating that reduction
   of annexin1 is a critical mechanism for immune evasion by Mtb.
   Collectively, these data indicate that annexin1 is essential in immunity
   to Mtb infection and mediates the power of DC efferocytosis and
   cross-presentation.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of a cold shot in an aircraft turbine blade can lead to the
   catastrophic failure of the blade and ultimately to the failure of the
   power plant. Currently, no nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method exists
   to detect this kind of defect. This deficiency is primarily due to the
   fact that the only known cold shot defects in existence are those found
   in failed blades. Therefore, in order to develop effective NDE methods,
   reference specimens are needed which mimic the embedded oxide layer that
   is a primary distinguishing feature of a cold shot. Here, we present a
   procedure to synthetically reproduce the features of a real cold shot in
   Inconel 600 and the precise characterization of this oxide layer as a
   reference specimen suitable for NDE evaluation. As a first step to
   develop a suitable NDE technique, high-frequency ultrasound simulations
   are considered. A theoretical 1-D model is developed in order to
   quantify the multiple reflection-transmission trajectory of the acoustic
   wave in the reference specimen. This paper also presents an experimental
   determination of the density and the Young's modulus of the Inconel 600
   oxide, which are required as inputs to calculate the acoustic impedance
   used in the theoretical model.}},

Abstract = {{Phase shift cavity ring down spectroscopy (PS-CRDS) in conjunction with
   microcavities provides a highly sensitive approach for sensing
   applications. However, there have been no complete and accurate
   analytical expressions demonstrated so far for PS-CRDS based upon
   measurement of the transmitted waveguide signal only in a
   microcavity-waveguide system. For determining the ring down time of a
   microcavity, currently researchers employ PS-CRDS measurements either at
   multiple modulation frequencies or in the Rayleigh backscattered regime
   in conjunction with PS-CRDS measurements in the transmission mode of a
   microcavity-waveguide system. Here, we develop analytical expressions
   for PS-CRDS in waveguide-coupled microcavities by utilizing the coupled
   mode theory. Our mathematical treatment allows us to determine the ring
   down time of a microcavity by measuring a signal in the transmission
   mode (waveguide signal) only. The derived equations are also validated
   numerically and experimentally. The present work will find wide
   applications in sensors and modulators based upon microcavities. (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of the current study is to examine the in-plane and out-of-plane
   nonlinear size-dependent dynamics of a microplate resting on an elastic
   foundation, constrained by distributed rotational springs at boundaries.
   Employing the von Karman plate theory as well as Kirchhoff's hypotheses,
   the equations of motion for the in-plane and out-of-plane directions are
   derived by means of the Lagrange equations, based on the modified couple
   stress theory. The potential energies stored in a Winkler-type elastic
   foundation and the rotational springs at the edges of the microplate are
   taken into account. The set of second-order nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations, obtained via the Lagrange scheme, is recast into
   a double-dimensional set of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential
   equations with coupled terms by means of a change of variables. The
   linear natural frequencies of the system are obtained through use of an
   eigenvalue analysis upon the linear terms of the equations of motion.
   The nonlinear response, on the other hand, is obtained by means of the
   pseudo-arclength continuation method. The dynamical characteristics of
   the system are examined via plotting the frequency-response and
   force-response curves. The effect of the stiffness of the rotational and
   translational springs on the nonlinear size-dependent behaviour is also
   examined. Finally, the effect of employing the modified couple stress
   theory, rather than the classical theory, on the response is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(2-(N-carbazolyl)ethyl acrylate), a poly(acrylate) comprised of
   carbazole-side groups attached via a flexible chain to the polymer
   backbone (PVAK) has been tested as host for solution-processed polymer
   light-emitting devices (PLEDs). This non-conjugated polymer proved to be
   an excellent candidate to host wide-bandgap phosphors. Notably, this
   polymer exhibited a high thermal stability (T-d = 322 degrees C), a
   glass transition temperature (T-g) of 91 degrees C and a wide bandgap
   corresponding to the pendent carbazole units and the disrupted
   p-conjugation of the polymer main chain, making this polymeric host a
   suitable candidate for wide bandgap triplet emitters. When tested as a
   host for FIrpic and Ir(ppy)(3), the resulting blue and green
   light-emitting devices showed a maximum luminous efficiency of 18.25 and
   17.74 cd/A, respectively, which are comparable to recent reports of
   devices made using other carbazole-based oxygen-rich polymeric hosts.
   The polymer was also characterized by UV-visible absorption,

Abstract = {{The paper examines the influence of axial stress-induced closure of a
   fracture on its permeability. The experiments were conducted on a
   cylinder of Barre Granite measuring 457mm in diameter and 510mm in
   height, containing a central cylindrical cavity of diameter 75mm. Radial
   flow hydraulic pulse tests were conducted in a previous research
   investigation (Selvadurai etal., PAGEOPH, 2005) to determine the
   permeability characteristics of the intact granite. In the continuation
   of the research, a fracture was introduced in the cylinder with its
   nominal plane normal to the axis of the cylinder. Axial compressive
   stress was applied normal to the plane of the fracture. An increase in
   the compressive normal stress acting on the fracture caused a reduction
   in the aperture of the fracture, which resulted in the reduction in its
   permeability. Steady state radial flow tests were conducted on the
   fractured axially stressed sample to determine the variation of fracture
   permeability with axial normal stress. The analytical developments also
   take into account flow through the matrix region as the normal stress
   increases. The results of the experimental investigations indicate that
   the complete stress relief of a fracture previously subjected to a
   normal stress of 7.5MPa can result in a permeability increase of
   approximately three orders of magnitude. These findings are relevant to
   shallow depth geotechnical construction activities where enhanced fluid
   flow can be activated by stress relief. As the fracture aperture closes
   with high normal stress, the flow through the matrix can be appreciable
   and if this factor is not taken into consideration the interpretation of
   fracture permeability can be open to error. This factor can be of
   interest to the interpretation of permeability of fractures in deep
   crustal settings where the stresses acting normal to the fracture
   surface can inhibit flow in the fracture.}},

Abstract = {{The permeability of sediments is a major control on groundwater flow and
   the associated redistribution of heat and solutes in sedimentary basins.
   While porosity-permeability relationships of pure clays and pure sands
   have been relatively well established at the laboratory scale, the
   permeability of natural sediments remains highly uncertain. Here we
   quantify how well existing and new porosity-permeability equations can
   explain the permeability of noncemented siliciclastic sediments. We have
   compiled grain size, clay mineralogy, porosity, and permeability data on
   pure sand and silt (n=126), pure clay (n=148), and natural mixtures of
   sand, silt and clay (n=92). The permeability of pure sand and clay can
   be predicted with high confidence (R(2)0.9) using the Kozeny-Carman
   equation and empirical power law equations, respectively. The
   permeability of natural sediments is much higher than predicted by
   experimental binary mixtures and ideal packing models. Permeability can
   be predicted with moderate confidence (R-2=0.26- 0.48) and a mean error
   of 0.6 orders of magnitude as either the geometric mean or arithmetic
   mean of the permeability of the pure clay and sand components, with the
   geometric mean providing the best measure of the variability of
   permeability. We test the new set of equations on detailed well-log and
   permeability data from deltaic sediments in the southern Netherlands,
   showing that permeability can be predicted with a mean error of 0.7
   orders of magnitude using clay content and porosity derived from neutron
   and density logs.}},

Abstract = {{The permeability of crystalline rocks is generally assumed to decrease
   with depth due to increasing overburden stress. While experiments have
   confirmed the dependence of permeability on stress, field measurements
   of crystalline permeability have not previously yielded an unambiguous
   and universal relation between permeability and depth in the shallow
   crust (<2.5km). Large data sets from Sweden, Germany and Switzerland
   provide new opportunities to characterize the permeability of
   crystalline rocks in the shallow crust. Here we compile in situ
   permeability measurements (n=973) and quantitatively test potential
   relationships between permeability, depth (0-2.5km), lithology
   (intrusive and metamorphic) and tectonic setting (active and inactive).
   Higher permeabilities are more common at shallow depths (<1km), but
   trend analysis does not support a consistently applicable and
   generalizable relationship between permeability and depth in crystalline
   rock in the shallow crust. Results suggest lithology has a weak control
   on permeability-depth relations in the near surface (<0.1km), regardless
   of tectonic setting, but may be a more important control at depth.
   Tectonic setting appears to be a stronger control on permeability-depth
   relations in the near surface. Permeability values in the tectonically
   active Molasse basin are scattered with a very weak relationship between
   permeability and depth. While results indicate that there is no
   consistently applicable relationship between permeability and depth for
   crystalline rock in the shallow crust, some specific lithologies and
   tectonic settings display a statistically significant decrease of
   permeability with depth, with greater predictive power than a
   generalized relationship, that could be useful for hydrologic and earth
   system models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the optimal signaling scheme and capacity of the
   Bernoulli-Gaussian impulsive noise channel to shed new light on the
   impact of impulsive noise on spectral efficiency of power-line
   communications systems. First, by focusing on the practically typical
   case with impulse power that is much higher than signal power, we
   develop a tight approximation to the differential entropy of
   Bernoulli-Gaussian noise. Closed-form tight lower and upper bounds on
   the capacity are then derived. By comparing these bounds, it is
   demonstrated that the capacity decreases with an increasing impulse
   occurrence rate and the Gaussian signaling scheme is nearly optimal. We
   then focus on the case with an impulse power lower than signal power to
   develop tight lower and upper bounds. We subsequently show that the
   Gaussian signaling can approach the capacity in this region as well. In
   addition, channel erasure is shown to be very effective for the
   impulsive noise channel when impulse power is higher than signal power,
   but it introduces rate loss when impulse power is sufficiently lower
   than signal power. Illustrative simulation results confirm the
   analytical derivations and show their applications to estimate the
   maximum achievable rate of a power-line communication link with
   practical parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The use of five-axis machine tools is increasing because of their
   flexibility and high throughput. However, having more components in
   motion, these machines are more prone to failure than their three-axis
   counterparts. In this paper, using previously published tests of the
   double ball bar (DBB), the deviations of the rotary axis are measured
   and then treated to remove the eccentricity due to setup errors. Fast
   Fourier transform (FFT) analysis is applied to the centered readings, in
   order to obtain the machine frequency spectrum. From the latter, the
   contribution of error sources and their amplitude are obtained. This
   method can be used on a regular basis as a predictive maintenance (PM)
   tool. The novelty of this work falls in the realm of condition
   monitoring (CM) of rotary-axis components using a commercial instrument,

Abstract = {{To improve the control precision of nonlinear spacecraft formation
   flying, the input-output linearization minimum sliding-mode error
   feedback controller is presented based on the linear-decoupled
   spacecraft formation model by input-output linearization method
   incorporating the sliding-mode control. This paper proposes a new
   strategy to estimate and offset the system-control errors, which include
   various kinds of uncertainties and disturbances. To facilitate the
   analysis, the linear-decoupled spacecraft formation model is first
   given; on which basis, the concept of equivalent control error is
   introduced to define the entire model error. Based on the minimum
   sliding-mode covariance constraint, a cost function is formulated to
   estimate the equivalent control error and fed back to the conventional
   sliding-mode control. It is shown that the sliding mode after the
   input-output linearization minimum sliding-mode error feedback
   controller will approximate to the ideal sliding mode with high-control
   precision. In addition, the new methodology is applied to spacecraft
   formation flying. It guarantees global asymptotic convergence of the
   relative-tracking error in the presence of the large perturbations. More
   exactly, the two input-output linearization minimum sliding-mode error
   feedback controller laws (continuous sliding-mode control and
   nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control) are developed for this
   spacecraft formation flying system. Several fault-tolerant scenarios are
   considered to verify that the input-output linearization minimum
   sliding-mode error feedback controller is still effective in the
   presence of faults in spacecraft thrusters. Numerical simulations are
   performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology to
   maintain and reconfigure the spacecraft formation with existence of
   initial offsets and large perturbations effects.}},

Abstract = {{Several groundwater-level forecasting studies have shown that
   data-driven models are simpler, faster to develop, and provide more
   accurate and precise results than physical or numerical-based models.
   Five data-driven models were examined for the forecasting of groundwater
   levels as a result of recharge via tailings from an abandoned mine in
   Quebec, Canada, for lead times of 1 day, 1 week and 1 month. The five
   models are: a multiple linear regression (MLR); an artificial neural
   network (ANN); two models that are based on de-noising the model
   predictors using the wavelet-transform (W-MLR, W-ANN); and a W-ensemble
   ANN (W-ENN) model. The tailing recharge, total precipitation, and mean
   air temperature were used as predictors. The ANN models performed better
   than the MLR models, and both MLR and ANN models performed significantly
   better after de-noising the predictors using wavelet-transforms.
   Overall, the W-ENN model performed best for each of the three lead
   times. These results highlight the ability of wavelet-transforms to
   decompose non-stationary data into discrete wavelet-components,
   highlighting cyclic patterns and trends in the time-series at varying
   temporal scales, rendering the data readily usable in forecasting. The
   good performance of the W-ENN model highlights the usefulness of
   ensemble modeling, which ensures model robustness along with improved
   reliability by reducing variance.}},

Abstract = {{Recent numerical developments dedicated to the simulation of
   rotor/stator interaction involving direct structural contacts have been
   integrated within the Snecma industrial environment. This paper presents
   the first attempt to benefit from these developments and account for
   structural blade/casing contacts at the design stage of a high-pressure
   compressor blade. The blade of interest underwent structural divergence
   after blade/abradable coating contact occurrences on a rig test. The
   design improvements were carried out in several steps with significant
   modifications of the blade stacking law while maintaining aerodynamic
   performance of the original blade design. After a brief presentation of
   the proposed design strategy, basic concepts associated with the design
   variations are recalled. The iterated profiles are then numerically
   investigated and compared with respect to key structural criteria such
   as: (1) their mass, (2) the residual stresses stemming from centrifugal
   stiffening, (3) the vibratory level under aerodynamic forced response,
   and (4) the vibratory levels when unilateral contact occurs. Significant
   improvements of the final blade design are found: the need for an early
   integration of nonlinear structural interactions criteria in the design
   stage of modern aircraft engines components is highlighted.}},

Title = {{The Role of the Orthogonal Helicoid in the Generation of the Tooth
   Flanks of Involute-Gear Pairs With Skew Axes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Camus' concept of auxiliary surface (AS) is extended to the case of
   involute gears with skew axes. In the case at hand, we show that the AS
   is an orthogonal helicoid whose axis (a) lies in the cylindroid and (b)
   is normal to the instant screw axis of one gear with respect to its
   meshing counterpart; in general, the helicoid axis is skew with respect
   to the latter. According to the spatial version of Camus' Theorem, any
   line or surface attached to the AS, in particular any line L of AS
   itself, can be chosen to generate a pair of conjugate flanks with line
   contact. While the pair of conjugate flanks is geometrically feasible,
   as they always share a line of contact and the tangent plane at each
   point of this line, they even have the same curvature, G(2)-continuity,
   when L coincides with the instant screw axis (ISA). This means that the
   two surfaces penetrate each other, at the same common line. The outcome
   is that the surfaces are not realizable as tooth flanks. Nevertheless,
   this is a fundamental step toward the synthesis of the flanks of
   involute gears with skew axes. In fact, the above-mentioned
   interpenetration between the tooth flanks can be avoided by choosing a
   smooth surface attached to the AS, instead of a line of the AS itself,
   which can give, in particular, the spatial version of octoidal bevel
   gears, when a planar surface is chosen.}},

Title = {{Medium-Term Urban Water Demand Forecasting with Limited Data Using an
   Ensemble Wavelet-Bootstrap Machine-Learning Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and reliable weekly and monthly water demand forecasting is
   important for effective and sustainable planning and use of urban water
   supply infrastructure. This study explored a hybrid
   wavelet-bootstrap-artificial neural network (WBANN) modeling approach
   for weekly (one-week) and monthly (one- and two-month) urban water
   demand forecasting in situations with limited data availability. The
   performance of WBANN models was also compared with that of standard
   artificial neural networks (ANN), bootstrap-based ANN (BANN), and
   wavelet-based ANN (WANN) models. The proposed WBANN method is aimed at
   improving the accuracy and reliability of water demand forecasting by
   incorporating the capability of wavelet transformation and bootstrap
   analysis using artificial neural networks. Daily and monthly maximum
   temperature, total precipitation, and water demand data for almost three
   years obtained from the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada were used in
   this study. For weekly and monthly lead-time forecasting, the hybrid
   WBANN and WANN models were determined to be more accurate compared with
   the ANN and BANN methods. The WANN and WBANN models simulated peak water
   demand very effectively. The better performance of the WANN and WBANN
   models for weekly and monthly water demand forecasts indicated that
   wavelet analysis significantly improved the model's performance, whereas
   the bootstrap technique improved the reliability of water demand
   forecasts by producing ensemble forecasts. WBANN models were also found
   to be effective in assessing the uncertainty associated with water
   demand forecasts in terms of confidence bands, which is helpful in
   operational water demand forecasting. This study was conducted with a
   very short length of available data, indicating the effectiveness of
   WANN and WBANN modeling approaches in situations with limited data
   availability. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Typical challenges of simulation-based design optimization include
   unavailable gradients and unreliable approximations thereof, expensive
   function evaluations, numerical noise, multiple local optima, and the
   failure of the analysis to return a value to the optimizer. One possible
   remedy to alleviate these issues is to use surrogate models in lieu of
   the computational models or simulations and derivative-free optimization
   algorithms. In this work, we use the R dynaTree package to build
   statistical surrogates of the blackboxes and the direct search method
   for derivative-free optimization. We present different formulations for
   the surrogate problem (SP) considered at each search step of the mesh
   adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm using a surrogate management
   framework. The proposed formulations are tested on 20 analytical
   benchmark problems and two simulation-based multidisciplinary design
   optimization (MDO) problems. Numerical results confirm that the use of
   statistical surrogates in MADS improves the efficiency of the
   optimization algorithm.}},

   resuscitation fluids, then followed for another 60 min.
   PolyHb-SOD-CAT-CA maintained the MAP at 87.5 +/- 5 mmHg as compared with
   3 volumes of lactated Ringer's solution, 43.3 +/- 2.8 mmHg; blood, 91.3
   +/- 3.6 mmHg; polyHb-SOD-CAT, 86.0 +/- 4.6 mmHg; poly stroma-free
   hemolysate (polySFHb), 85.0 +/- 2.5 mmHg; and polyHb, 82.6 +/- 3.5 mmHg.
   PolyHb-SOD-CAT-CA was superior to the blood and other fluids based on
   the following criteria. PolyHb-SOD-CAT-CA reduced tissue pCO(2) from 98
   +/- 4.5 mmHg to 68.6 +/- 3 mmHg. This was significantly (p < 0.05) more
   effective than lactated Ringer's solution (98 +/- 4.5 mmHg), polyHb
   (90.1 +/- 4.0 mmHg), polyHb-SOD-CAT (90.9 +/- 1.4 mmHg), blood (79.1 +/-
   4.7 mmHg), and polySFHb (77 +/- 5 mmHg). PolyHb-SOD-CAT-CA reduced the
   elevated ST level to 21.7 +/- 6.7\% and is significantly (<0.05) better
   than polyHb (57.7 +/- 8.7\%), blood (39.1 +/- 1.5\%), polySFHb (38.3\%
   +/- 2.1\%), polyHb-SOD-CAT (27.8 +/- 5.6\%), and lactated Ringer's
   solution (106 +/- 3.1\%). The plasma cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level of
   polyHb-SOD-CAT-CA group was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of
   all the other groups. PolyHb-SOD-CAT-CA reduced plasma lactate level
   from 18 +/- 2.3 mM/L to 6.9 +/- 0.3 mM/L. It was significantly more
   effective (P < 0.05) than lactated Ringer's solution (12.4 +/- 0.6
   mM/L), polyHb (9.6 +/- 0.7 mM/L), blood (8.1 +/- 0.2 mM/L), polySFHb
   (8.4 +/- 0.1 mM/L), and polyHb-SOD-CAT (7.6 +/- 0.3 mM/L).
   PolyHb-SOD-CAT-CA can be stored for 320 days at room temperature.
   Lyophilized poly-Hb-SOD-CAT-CA can be heat pasteurized at 68F for 2 h.
   This can be important if there is a need to inactivate human
   immunodeficiency virus, Ebola virus, and other infectious organisms.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear thermal instability of moving sandwich plates subjected to
   a constant moving speed is investigated. The sandwich plates are made of
   a shape memory alloy (SMA) fiber reinforced composite core and two
   functionally graded (FG) face sheets (FG/SMA/FG). The Brinson model is
   used for Modeling of SMA behavior, and the geometrically nonlinear
   third-order shear deformation theory is used for modeling of sandwich
   plates. Thermomechanical properties of the sandwich plate are assumed to
   be temperature-dependent. Two types of in-plane boundary conditions are
   considered. The nonlinear instability is treated by the Galerkin
   technique. The results show that the initial equilibrium configuration
   of the sandwich plate becomes unstable at a critical moving speed.
   Results examine the effect of axial moving speed, SMA volume fraction,
   pre-strain of SMA fiber, core thickness, imperfection, in-plane boundary
   conditions, and thermal loading on the stability characteristics of the
   sandwich plates. It is found that a proper application of SMA fibers
   postpone the thermal buckling and critical moving speed. Furthermore,
   the induced tensile recovery stress of SMA fibers could also stabilize
   geometrically imperfect plates during the reverse martensite
   transformation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   generation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{367-374}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Using stochastic unit commitment (SUC) to study the integration of
   uncertain wind power in transmission congested systems is
   computationally very intensive. This paper therefore presents an
   efficient deterministic alternative to SUC that generalizes the
   traditional three-sigma approach to transmission congested systems. In
   this Generalized Sigma or G-Sigma method, the bus residual demands and
   line power flows are treated as correlated random variables. Compared
   with SUC where wind power forecast uncertainty is represented through a
   large pool of scenarios, each with a distinct probability of occurrence,
   in the proposed G-Sigma method, a few representative scenarios are
   chosen on the perimeter of the elliptical confidence region
   corresponding to a certain level of security. The generation set points
   and reserve capacities are then scheduled to meet these few
   representative scenarios in addition to the expected error-free
   scenarios, thus guaranteeing a minimum level of security.
   The accuracy and performance of the proposed G-Sigma method were gauged
   and compared to a benchmark SUC via a three-region multi-unit system and
   by the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system with multiple units. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The paper presents results on the mechanisms of plastic strain
   accommodation of Ni-Al laminates composed of concentrically aligned thin
   foils processed at different conditions undergoing a high strain radial
   collapse in thick walled cylinder experiments. Numerical simulations
   were conducted to examine the influence of mesoscale parameters (layer
   size, defects in mesostructure, and ductility) on the mechanisms of
   large plastic strain accommodation (high amplitude cooperative buckling;
   high frequency, low amplitude buckling; and kinking) at high strain
   rates in pure shear (plane strain) conditions. These mechanisms are
   dramatically different than observed in solid ductile and brittle
   homogeneous materials where a pattern of shear bands is the major mode
   of strain accommodation. It was observed that the layer thickness and
   ductility greatly influenced the dominant mode of plastic strain
   accommodation. The number of apices was related to the layer thickness.
   The presence of defects mainly had a localized area of influence.
   Numerical simulations showed good qualitative agreement with the
   experiments and provided the ability to simulate additional mesoscale
   and material dependencies: the role of friction/bonding, relative layer
   sizes, and sample thickness. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{As humans age, a characteristic pattern of widespread neocortical
   dendritic disruption coupled with compensatory effects in hippocampus
   and other subcortical structures is shown in postmortem investigations.
   It is now possible to address age-related effects on gray matter (GM)
   neuritic organization and density in humans using multishell
   diffusion-weighted MRI and the neurite-orientation dispersion and
   density imaging (NODDI) model. In 45 healthy individuals across the
   adult lifespan (21-84 years), we used a multishell diffusion imaging and
   the NODDI model to assess the intraneurite volume fraction and neurite
   orientation-dispersion index (ODI) in GM tissues. Wealso determined the
   functional correlates of variations inGMmicrostructure by obtaining
   resting-state fMRI and behavioral data. We found a significant
   age-related deficit in neocortical ODI (most prominently in
   frontoparietal regions), whereas increased ODI was observed in
   hippocampus and cerebellum with advancing age. Neocortical ODI
   outperformed cortical thickness and white matter fractional anisotropy
   for the prediction of chronological age in the same individuals. Higher
   GM ODI sampled from resting-state networks with known age-related
   susceptibility (default mode and visual association networks) was
   associated with increased functional connectivity of these networks,
   whereas the task-positive networks tended to show no association or even
   decreased connectivity. Frontal pole ODI mediated the negative
   relationship of age with executive function, whereas hippocampal ODI
   mediated the positive relationship of age with executive function. Our
   in vivo findings align very closely with the postmortem data and provide
   evidence for vulnerability and compensatory neural mechanisms of aging
   in GM microstructure that have functional and cognitive impact in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Collagen (COL), the most abundant protein in mammals, offers a wide
   range of attractive properties for biomedical applications which are the
   result of its biocompatibility and high affinity to water. However, due
   to the relative low mechanical properties of COL its applications are
   still limited. To tackle this disadvantage of COL, especially in the
   field of bone tissue engineering, COL can be combined with bioactive
   inorganic materials in a variety of composite systems. One of such
   systems is the collagen-bioactive glass (COL-BG) composite family, which
   is the theme of this Review. BG fillers can increase compressive
   strength and stiffness of COL-based structures. This article reviews the
   relevant literature published in the last 15 years discussing the
   fabrication of a variety of COL-BG composites. In vitro cell studies
   have demonstrated the osteogenic, odontogenic, and angiogenic potential
   of these composite systems, which has been confirmed by stimulating
   specific biochemical indicators of relevant cells. Bony integration and
   connective tissue vessel formation have also been studied by
   implantation of the composites in vivo. Areas of future research in the
   field of COL-BG systems, based on current challenges, and gaps in
   knowledge are highlighted.}},

Title = {{Hydro-Responsive Curling of the Resurrection Plant Selaginella
   lepidophylla}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{The spirally arranged stems of the spikemoss Selaginella lepidophylla,
   an ancient resurrection plant, compactly curl into a nest-ball shape
   upon dehydration. Due to its spiral phyllotaxy, older outer stems on the
   plant interlace and envelope the younger inner stems forming the plant
   centre. Stem curling is a morphological mechanism that limits
   photoinhibitory and thermal damages the plant might experience in arid
   environments. Here, we investigate the distinct conformational changes
   of outer and inner stems of S. lepidophylla triggered by dehydration.
   Outer stems bend into circular rings in a relatively short period of
   desiccation, whereas inner stems curl slowly into spirals due to
   hydro-actuated strain gradient along their length. This arrangement
   eases both the tight packing of the plant during desiccation and its
   fast opening upon rehydration. The insights gained from this work shed
   light on the hydro-responsive movements in plants and might contribute
   to the development of deployable structures with remarkable shape
   transformations in response to environmental stimuli.}},

   and experimentation. The RMP is shown to have a better nonlinear
   tolerance than the RRC pulse for most investigated scenarios except for
   links with zero residual dispersion percentage per span or the zero
   dispersion region of a fiber. Therefore, the RMP is suitable for
   extending the maximum reach of spectrally efficient coherent

Abstract = {{This study aimed at testing the reliability and construct validity of a
   trunk perturbation protocol (TPP) that estimates the intrinsic and
   reflexive contributions to low-back stiffness. The TPP consists of a
   series of pseudorandom position-controlled trunk perturbations in an
   apparatus measuring forces and displacements at the harness surrounding
   the thorax. Intrinsic and reflexive contributions to low-back stiffness
   were estimated using a system identification procedure, leading to 12
   parameters. Study 1 methods (reliability): 30 subjects performed five
   75-s trials, on each of two separate days (eight weeks apart).
   Reliability was assessed using the generalizability theory, which
   allowed computing indexes of dependability (phi, analogous to intraclass
   correlation coefficient) and standard errors of measurement (SEM). Study
   2 methods (validity): 20 healthy subjects performed three 75-s trials
   for each of five experimental conditions assumed to provide different
   lumbar stiffness; testing the construct validity of the TPP using four
   conditions with different lumbar belt designs and one control condition
   without. Study 1 results (reliability): Learning was seen between the
   first and following trials. Consequently, reliability analyses were
   performed without the first trial. Simulations showed that averaging the
   scores of three trials can lead to acceptable reliability results for
   some TPP parameters. Study 2 results (validity): All lumbar belt designs
   increased low-back intrinsic stiffness, while only some of them
   decreased reflex stiffness, which support the construct validity of the
   TPP. Overall, these findings support the use of the TPP to test the
   effect of rehabilitation or between-groups differences with regards to
   trunk stiffness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the demonstration of a new type of axial nanowire LED
   heterostructures, with the use of self-organized InGaN/AlGaN
   dot-in-a-wire core-shell nanowire arrays. The large bandgap AlGaN shell
   is spontaneously formed on the sidewall of the nanowire during the
   growth of AlGaN barrier of the quantum dot active region. As such,
   nonradiative surface recombination, that dominates the carrier dynamics
   of conventional axial nanowire LED structures, can be largely
   eliminated, leading to significantly increased carrier lifetime from
   similar to 0.3 ns to 4.5 ns. The luminescence emission is also enhanced
   by orders of magnitude. Moreover, the p-doped AlGaN barrier layers can
   function as distributed electron blocking layers (EBLs), which is found
   to be more effective in reducing electron overflow, compared to the
   conventional AlGaN EBL. The device displays strong white-light emission,
   with a color rendering index of similar to 95. An output power of >5 mW
   is measured for a 1 mm 3 1 mm device, which is more than 500 times
   stronger than the conventional InGaN axial nanowire LEDs without AlGaN
   distributed EBLs.}},

Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{The three operating parameters - temperature, stoichiometry and the
   degree of humidification - constitute key factors required to ensure
   high performance of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). A careful
   trade-off between performance and parasitic loads is required in order
   to optimize the output. The present study numerically analyzes the
   influence of the key operating parameters on the performance of planar
   type of SOFC and parasitic loads utilizing a validated three dimensional
   mathematical model which takes into account of the conservation of mass,
   momentum, species and charge. The numerical results indicate that the
   cell performance is enhanced at high temperatures and cathode
   stoichiometry and it declines with increasing cathode relative humidity.
   Furthermore, cathode stoichiometry is found to have higher influence on
   the cell performance as compared to the anode stoichiometry. The gain in
   cell performance however, has to be balanced with the changing parasitic
   load requirement from pumping, humidification and heating. The results
   presented herein can assist in the selection of optimum or
   near-to-optimum operating parameters for high performance planar type
   SOFC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A thermally prepared iridium/ruthenium-oxide coating (Ir0.8Ru0.2-oxide)
   formed on a titanium substrate was investigated as a possible electrode
   for direct electrochemical regeneration of enzymatically-active 1,4-NADH
   from its oxidized form NAD(+), at various electrode potentials, in a
   batch electrochemical reactor. The coating surface was characterized by
   `cracked mud' morphology, yielding a high surface roughness. The NADH
   regeneration results showed that the percentage of enzymatically-active
   1,4-NADH present in the product mixture (i.e. recovery) is strongly
   dependent on the electrode potential, reaching a maximum (88\%) at -1.70
   V vs. MSE. The relatively high recovery was explained on the basis of
   availability of adsorbed `active' hydrogen (H-ads) on the Ir/Ru-oxide
   surface, i.e. on the basis of electrochemical hydrogenation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The in-situ production of hydrogen from a metal-water reaction resolves
   some of the main obstacles related to the use of hydrogen as an
   alternative fuel, namely storage and safety. In this study, experiments
   are conducted in a batch reactor with sixteen different
   commercially-available industrial metal powders, with water temperatures
   ranging from 80 to 200 degrees C. The hydrogen production rate, total
   yield, and reaction completeness are determined for each metal-powder
   fuel and reaction temperature. Aluminum powder produces the largest
   amount of hydrogen per unit mass throughout the temperature range,
   followed by the magnesium powder. Manganese powder, which produces the
   largest amount of hydrogen per unit volume at high temperatures,
   exhibits a sharp increase in yield between 120 and 150 degrees C,
   suggesting the existence of a critical energetic threshold. The aluminum
   and magnesium powders exhibit high reaction rates, and together with the
   manganese powder, appear to be the most attractive candidates to serve
   as fuels for in-situ hydrogen production. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the density of solutions of polyethylene (PE) in
   hexane using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based upon the accurate
   OPLS-AA force field at high pressures and 425 K. The NPT-MD simulations
   are carried out at polymer concentration 0120 wt\% in hexane in the
   pressure range from 100 to 3000 bar. For PE solutions of 10 and 20 wt\%
   the pressure is varied from 100 to 1000 bar. Additionally, the PE
   solution densities are calculated based on the modified Sanchez-Lacombe
   (MSL) equation of state (EOS) model to examine the accuracy of the MD
   computations. The simulated densities increase monotonically with
   increasing external pressure and compare quite favorably with the
   experimental and EOS data It is also revealed that the MSL EOS model
   produces identical mixture densities regardless of the type of the b
   parameter. The effect of cut-off radius to density is investigated and
   It is shown that the solution density increases as cut-off radius
   increases. A minimum cut-off radius of 1.1 nm is suggested for the
   intermolecular forces for accurate densities at pressures below 100 bar.
   for higher pressures density and non-bonded interactions display less
   sensitivity to cut-off distance. Analysis of the pair distribution
   function versus pressure is carried out where the height of the first
   peak increases and the radial distribution function shifts to shorter
   separations reflecting structural change of the condensed phase. The
   molecular modeling approach employed in this research provides a good
   insight into the polymer-polymer, polymer-solvent, and solvent-solvent
   interactions. The implemented methodology using the OPLS-AA force field
   and constant pressure/temperature algorithms compare well with the
   literature data, suggesting the validity of the proposed method. (C)

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the sintering response of a hypereutectic
   aluminum-silicon alloy, specifically Alumix-231 (Al-14Si-2.5Cu-0.5Mg),
   using Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). The focus was to link the influence
   of the sintering parameters to the sintered density, microstructure,
   hardness and flexural properties in T1 and T6 conditions. The results
   were compared to those obtained using the conventional press and sinter
   route, a method typically used for this alloy. The samples consolidated
   using SPS attained densities between 95\% and 100\%TD compared to those
   obtained by conventional sintering which were approximately 94\%TD.
   Before and after the aging heat treatment, microhardness and mechanical
   properties were assessed for both SPS and press-sinter samples. After
   sintering, in the TI condition, a hardness of 89 +/- 7 HV, a flexural
   strength of 702 +/- 28 MPa and a flexural strain of 6.2 +/- 1.2\% were
   obtained for the SPS samples. In the T6 condition, a hardness of 157 +/-
   5 HV, a flexural strength of 654 +/- 38 MPa and a flexural strain of 4.4
   +/- 0.2\% were obtained in the ideal SPS conditions. On the other hand,
   a hardness of 137 +/- 8 HV, a flexural strength of 315 +/- 69 MPa, and a
   flexural strain of 3.4 +/- 0.1\% were achieved for the conventional
   sintering process after the T6 heat treatment. The hardness in the T1
   condition was lower than what had been reported in the literature,
   however after a T6 heat treatment, hardness values obtained in this
   study were similar to previous work. On the other hand, the difference
   in flexural properties was unlike previous studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Strategies to improve the strength of Al-Si alloys at elevated
   temperatures can follow two routes: (i) improving the age-hardening
   behavior and/or (ii) producing effective dispersoid strengthening. In
   this study, the influence of Mg (in the range of 0.3-0.7 wt\%) on the
   precipitation characteristics and mechanical properties of the
   Al-7Si-0.5Cu-(Mg) alloy was investigated. Thermodynamic calculations
   were performed via the CALPHAD method which showed that Q-Al5Mg8Cu2Si6
   is the main thermodynamically stable precipitate at 300 degrees C. The
   calculations were validated by transmission electron microscopy and
   differential scanning calorimetry analyses. Increasing the Mg level from
   0.3 wt\% to the maximum solubility limit of similar to 0.5 wt\%
   increased the amount of the Q-Al5Mg8Cu2Si6 precipitates at 300 degrees C
   by similar to 60 wt\% and significantly improved the tensile strength
   and creep resistance at the expense of some ductility. Mg in excess of
   the solubility limit was seen to remain within the microstructure in the
   form of the large pi-Al8FeMg3Si6 and beta-Mg2Si intermetallics after
   solution treatment at 530 degrees C. Cracking of the brittle
   pi-Al8FeMg3Si6 intermetallics during deformation was accounted for the
   decreased ductility of the alloys at high Mg levels. It is concluded
   that the Mg level can be increased to similar to 0.5 wt\% in the
   A-7Si-0.5Cu alloys to improve strength. However, for elevated
   temperature applications in which both strength and ductility are
   required (e.g. Diesel engine), modification of the pi-Al8FeMg3Si6
   intermetallics would be required to improve the ductility of the alloys
   with high Mg contents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of Mo addition on the microstructure and mechanical
   properties of an Al-7Si-0.5Cu-0.3Mg alloy (wt\%) was investigated. The
   Mo-containing alloy exhibited significant improvement in creep
   resistance over the base alloy. At 300 degrees C and 30 MPa, the minimum
   creep rate decreased by 95\% while creep time-to-fracture was increased
   by 2 orders of magnitude, from 50 min to 1500 min. The tensile yield
   strength at 300 degrees C was also increased by 25\%. These effects were
   attributed to the formation of novel Al-(Fe,Mo)-Si dispersoids during
   solution treatment in the grain interiors (intradendritic regions).
   Unlike the age-hardening precipitates, which coarsened resulting in loss
   of strength, these dispersoids were thermally stable and retained their
   strengthening effect at 300 degrees C. TEM investigations showed that
   the dislocation motions were effectively hindered by these fine
   dispersoids, leading to the reduction in the minimum creep rate. The
   onset of the tertiary creep stage was delayed by postponing the
   dislocation pile-up at the interdendritic Si particles. It was found
   that Mo addition suppressed the formation of the brittle plate-like
   beta-Al5FeSi intermetallics and formed a blocky phase in the cast
   microstructure, which resulted in 34\% increase in elongation at 300
   degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Abstract-This article presents a novel optimal design for a permanent
   magnet excitation transverse flux linear motor with an inner mover using
   bacterial foraging optimization. The target is maximizing the motor
   thrust force, which is the most important quantity in linear electric
   drives. The stator pole length, air-gap length, winding window width,
   and stator pole width define the search space for the optimization
   problem. The response surface methodology is used to build the
   mathematical model of the motor thrust force in terms of the design
   variables. It can create an objective function easily, and great
   computational time is saved. Finite-element computations are used for
   numerical experiments on the geometrical design variables to determine
   the coefficients of a second-order analytical model for the response
   surface methodology. The bacterial foraging optimization technique is
   used as a searching tool under the constraints of design variables for
   design optimization of the transverse flux linear motor to improve the
   motor thrust force. The effectiveness of the proposed bacterial foraging
   optimization model is then compared with that of both genetic algorithm
   and particle swarm optimization models. With this proposed bacterial
   foraging optimization technique, the thrust force of the initially
   designed transverse flux linear motor can be increased.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, an optimization approach based on the firefly
   algorithm (FA) is combined with a finite element simulation method (FEM)
   to determine the optimum design of pump and treat remediation systems.
   Three multi-objective functions in which pumping rate and clean-up time
   are design variables are considered and the proposed FA-FEM model is
   used to minimize operating costs, total pumping volumes and total
   pumping rates in three scenarios while meeting water quality
   requirements. The groundwater lift and contaminant concentration are
   also minimized through the optimization process. The obtained results
   show the applicability of the FA in conjunction with the FEM for the
   optimal design of groundwater remediation systems. The performance of
   the FA is also compared with the genetic algorithm (GA) and the FA is
   found to have a better convergence rate than the GA.}},

   interior of the given polytope, one can steer the nonlinear system to an
   epsilon neighborhood of any final state in the interior of the polytope
   in finite time, where epsilon depends on the size of the polytopic
   regions of the cover. We then study a hierarchy of covers, representing
   the nonlinear system at different levels of accuracy, and provide a

Abstract = {{LQG mean field systems with a major agent (i.e. non-asymptotically
   vanishing as the population size goes to infinity) and a population of
   minor agents (i.e. individually asymptotically negligible) are studied
   in (Huang, 2010) and (Nguyen and Huang, 2012). Due to presence of the
   major agent, the mean field becomes stochastic in contrast to the case
   with purely minor agents where mean field is deterministic (Huang et al
   2007). In (Caines and Kizilkale, 2013, 2014, S, en and Caines 2013,
   2014), it is assumed the major agent's state is partially observed by
   each minor agent, and the major agent completely observes its own state.
   Accordingly, each minor agent can recursively estimate the major agent's
   state, compute the system's mean field and thence generate the feedback
   control which yields epsilon-Nash equilibrium property. This paper
   investigates the problem of estimation and control for an LQG mean field
   system in which both the major agent and the minor agents partially
   observe the major agent's state. The existence of epsilon-Nash
   equilibria together with the individual agents' control laws yielding
   the equilibria are established wherein each agent recursively generates
   estimates of the major agent's state and hence generates a version of
   the system's mean field.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a lot of recent progress in understanding the structure
   of optimal control strategies in decentralized stochastic control, but
   not much is known about computational methods. In this paper, we propose
   two finite-state approximation methods for decentralized sequential
   hypothesis testing. The first method, which is called orthogonal search,
   is an iterative method that approximately solves the coupled dynamic
   programs proposed in Teneketzis and Ho, Information and Computation,
   1987. The second method, which is called direct search, approximates the
   performance of a threshold-based strategy and then searches over the
   thresholds using a derivative-free non-convex optimization algorithm.
   The approximations for both methods are based on the discretization of
   the information state process to a finite-state Markov chain, and
   calculating the absorption probabilities and absorption stopping times
   for appropriately defined absorption sets. The performance of both the
   methods is compared numerically.}},

Abstract = {{A decentralized control system with linear dynamics, quadratic cost, and
   Gaussian disturbances is considered. The system consists of a finite
   number of subsystems whose dynamics and per-step cost function are
   coupled through their mean-field (empirical average). The system has
   mean-field sharing information structure, i.e., each controller observes
   the state of its local subsystem (either perfectly or with noise) and
   the mean-field. It is shown that the optimal control law is unique,
   linear, and identical across all subsystems. Moreover, the optimal gains

Abstract = {{This paper studies optimal stochastic power control problem for a
   time-varying communication link, where the transmitter randomly harvests
   renewable energies from the environment. The harvested energies are
   stored in an energy buffer (or battery). Packets arrive at the
   transmitter data buffer with a constant rate mu. The objective is to
   maximize mu under the statistical delay and energy harvesting (EH)
   constraints. In order to study the optimal power control policy, we
   reformulate the problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process
   (MDP) using asymptotic delay analysis. The optimal policy and its
   structural properties are studied by employing the post-decision
   framework approach. We then propose an online power control algorithm,
   which converges to the optimal solution without requiring the
   statistical knowledge of the channel fading and EH processes. Numerical
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of the online algorithm for
   different delay constraints and EH settings.}},

Abstract = {{This work considers the relay selection and resource allocation problem
   (i.e., link scheduling, and rate allocation) for multi-source,
   multi-relay dual-hop wireless networks. The relays employ buffers to
   store the received data from the sources for future transmissions.
   End-to-end (E2E) delay of each traffic flow originated from a source or
   a relay is constrained in terms of maximum allowable delay-outage
   probability. To solve this problem, we first study the resource
   allocation problem to maximize the constant supportable arrival rate of
   a non-prioritized source under minimum rate requirements of the
   prioritized sources and relays for a given relay selection solution.
   Then, the optimal relay selection can be determined to support the
   largest rate of the non-prioritized source among all possible relay
   selection solutions. We derive the resource allocation solutions using
   asymptotic delay analysis and convex optimization techniques. We also
   develop an online allocation algorithm which does not require the
   knowledge of the fading statistics by using stochastic approximation
   theory. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of
   the proposed resource allocation design for relay selection under

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the energy-efficient resource allocation for

   Specifically, we aim to maximize the minimum weighted energy-efficiency
   (EE) of D2D links while guaranteeing the minimum data rates of the
   cellular links. This design, therefore, guarantees fairness for D2D
   links and quality-of-service (QoS) for cellular links. Toward this end,
   we first characterize the optimal power allocation for cellular links
   based on which the original resource allocation problem can be
   transformed into the joint sub-channel and power allocation problem for
   D2D links. We then propose a dual-based algorithm to solve the resource
   allocation problem in the dual domain. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
   that the proposed algorithm achieves strong performance guarantee.
   Numerical studies show that the proposed algorithm achieves nearly
   optimal performance, and it performs much better than the
   spectrum-efficient and conventional algorithms.}},

   we introduce a probabilistically robust design method, which aims to
   optimize the source transmission power and AF relaying matrix by
   maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
   at the destination, while satisfying a set of intercept probability
   constraints. The resultant optimization problem becomes non-convex, and
   hence we propose a conservative two-step solution, where the source
   transmission power and the relaying matrix are sequentially optimized.
   Our simulation results demonstrate the improved secrecy of the proposed

   reduced-rank beamformer so obtained. A detailed
   signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) analysis and a
   computational complexity analysis are carried out. Simulation results
   show that the proposed algorithm outperforms its linear counterpart and
   the full-rank algorithms, achieving the best convergence performance
   among all the analyzed methods with a relatively low complexity(1).}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an algorithm of a frequency flexible Gabor filter
   based on stochastic computation. The stochastic Gabor filter provides
   area-efficient hardware implementation compared to a traditional
   implementation, but a spacial frequency of the stochastic Gabor filter
   is restricted by the number of states in an up-down counter used in
   hardware. In the proposed algorithm, a frequency is determined by two
   parameters: the number of states and a scaling factor to an input
   signal. As the input-signal range is scaled down from a
   stochastic-signal range of {[}-1:1], a tentative frequency determined by
   the number of states is precisely controlled to synthesize a flexible
   frequency desired. The proposed stochastic Gabor filter is modelled and
   simulated in MATLAB that demonstrates a flexible frequency is
   synthesized, unlike the conventional method.}},

   Computer Science}},

Pages = {{241-243}},
Abstract = {{Objective - To compare the coverage of computer science literature in
   four bibliographic databases by checking the indexing of a selection of
   journal articles. The purpose of this comparison was to identify the
   most comprehensive database in computer science and determine whether
   more than one database is needed to search for articles on computer
   science topics.
   Design - Comparative database evaluation using citation analysis.
   Setting - Computer science journal literature found within the INSPEC,
   Scopus, Web of Science, and DBLP databases.
   Subjects - 1,135 computer science journal articles published by an
   Italian university's researchers from 1979 to 2014.
   Methods - The University of Milan's institutional repository (AIR),
   containing publications authored by the university's researchers, was
   searched in October 2014 for journal articles that were assigned the
   subject heading ``informatica{''} (the word for computer science in
   Italian). The author then searched the titles of these journal articles
   in each of the databases to check whether they were indexed. For
   articles indexed in all four databases, the author also examined the
   quality of the bibliographic records by looking for the presence of 20
   elements (e.g., the ``cited by{''} option, ranking of search results,
   precision of results, etc.) in each database's record. These overlapping
   articles were also searched in Google Scholar to help compare the
   quality of the records between the databases.
   Main Results - Scopus indexed 75.86\% of the journal articles found in
   AIR, Web of Science indexed 64.49\%, DBLP indexed 61.15\%, and INSPEC
   indexed 53.39\%. Web of Science and INSPEC put together covered 74.80\%
   of the articles, which is comparable to the amount indexed by Scopus.
   DBLP and Scopus contained the highest number of references to articles
   that were not found in the other databases, about 4\% each. Out of the
   1,135 journal articles, 391 (34.45\%) were indexed by all four
   databases, with Web of Science scoring the highest for providing the
   best quality bibliographic records for these articles.
   Conclusions - According to the author, the findings showed that INSPEC,
   Scopus, Web of Science, and DBLP ``complemented each other, in a way
   that neither one could replace the other{''} (p. 2068) when searching
   the computer science literature. While there was overlap between
   databases, they each also contained unique articles.}},

Title = {{Selecting Which Databases to Teach Students in Communication Disorders
   by Considering Database Pairs that Index Core Journals in the Field}},
Journal = {{EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{105-107}},
Abstract = {{Objective - There are two objectives in this research article. The first
   is to identify databases that librarians usually recommend to students
   for searching topics in communication disorders. The second is to
   compare these databases' indexing of core journals in communication
   disorders, with the purpose of ascertaining which databases should be
   taught first in a one-shot information literacy session.
   Design - A comparative database evaluation using citation analysis.
   Setting - 10 universities in the United States of America offering
   LibGuides for their audiology or speech language pathology programs.
   Subjects - Six databases: CINAHL, ERIC, Linguistics and Language
   Behavior Abstracts (LLBA), PsycINFO, PubMed/Medline, and Web of
   Science/Web of Knowledge.
   Methods - The author selected 10 universities from the top 20 included
   in the graduate school rankings for audiology and/or speech language
   pathology from U.S. News \& World Report. The 10 universities selected
   were chosen because their librarians published online subject guides
   using LibGuides that suggest databases students can use for searching
   topics in communication disorders. The LibGuides were then examined to
   identify the most popular recommended databases that the author
   subsequently used for comparing coverage of core journals in
   communication disorders. The author generated a core journals list by
   selecting the top 20 audiology and speech-language pathology journals
   from Journal Citation Reports, SCImago Journal \& Country Rank, and
   Google Scholar Top Publications. These three sources produced lists of
   influential journals in different subject areas by looking at the number
   of citations the journals have received, alongside other factors. The
   author searched for 33 journals in total in each of the subject
   databases previously identified.
   Main Results - The author found six databases that were mentioned in the
   LibGuides of at least half the universities investigated. None of the 6
   databases indexed all 33 core journals. The breakdown of the number of
   journals indexed in each database is as follows: Web of Science/Web of
   Knowledge indexed 32 of 33 core journals (97\%); PubMed/Medline indexed
   28 (85\%); PsycINFO indexed 27 (82\%); CINAHL indexed 25 (76\%); LLBA
   indexed 23 (70\%); and ERIC indexed 9 journals (27\%).
   Conclusion - The author discovered that pairing certain databases allows
   for coverage of all 33 core journals. These pairings are: PubMed/Medline
   with PsycINFO, PubMed/Medline with LLBA, PubMed/Medline with Web of
   Science, Web of Science with PsycINFO, and Web of Science with LLBA. The
   author suggests that librarians can create instructional materials for
   all recommended databases, ``but use information from this study
   together with institution-specific factors to decide which databases to
   prioritize in face-to-face instruction sessions for speech-language
   pathology and audiology students{''} (Conclusion).}},

Abstract = {{A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of a Rushton impeller
   mixing water inside a baffled vessel was used to input steady state
   fluid drag forces into a discrete element method (DEM) simulation of a
   fine quartz particle of 60 mu m freely moving inside the vessel. To
   validate the simulated behaviour of the particle, a modular positron
   emission particle tracking (PEPT) camera was used to track a real quartz
   particle of a diameter between 53 and 63 mu m. The particle used as the
   tracer was created from a 1180 mu m particle labelled with F-18
   radionuclide inside a cyclotron beam. A comparison of typical trajectory
   and velocities of the particle for both the model (CFD-DEM) and the
   measurement (PEPT) is presented. The results show that the simulation
   approach used is suitable to represent the behaviour of small particle
   of this type in water like fluid as similar trajectories and velocities
   are present. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   spectrum information that is not well represented in the time domain
   signal. Second,the redundancies inherent in WSW based DNNs are
   considered. The performance of acoustic models defined over WSW features
   is compared to that obtained from acoustic models defined over mel
   frequency spectrum coefficient (MFSC) features on the Wall Street
   Journal (WSJ) speech corpus. It is shown that using WSW features results
   in a 3.0 percent increase in WER relative to that resulting from MFSC
   features on the WSJ corpus. However, when combined with MFSC features, a
   reduction in WER of 4.1 percent is obtained with respect to the best
   evaluated MFSC based DNN acoustic model.}},

   algorithms with moderate complexity. In order to further improve the
   performance, the power allocation algorithm is combined with the
   framework of SLNR beamforming. Based on the combined algorithm, we can
   maximize sum capacity and guarantee users' requirements in multiuser

   problem is transformed into convex optimization and then solved by
   geometric programming. Simulation results show that sum capacity of the

Abstract = {{As transient and permanent failures are rise shrinking process
   technology, MPSoC systems with fail-operational behavior have become
   important, especially for safety-critical applications. We therefore
   propose RotR, a rotational task mapping approach for an
   active-redundancy-based system to facilitate parallel execution of
   redundant tasks. RotR maps tasks such that no single failure affects
   more than one copy of a redundant task, and utilizes a multi-functional
   voter task that adapts its functionality based on the system's
   redundancy state after each component failure. RotR mapping and the
   proposed voter task jointly enable fail-operational behavior by
   seamlessly transitioning from higher reliability (e.g., Triple Modular
   Redundancy) to lower reliability (e.g., Double Modular Redundancy)
   without requiring task re-mapping. Our results show that RotR improves a
   system's fault-tolerant lifetime on average by 37\% and 48\% over
   standard DMR and TMR systems, respectively. Furthermore, it improves the
   overall lifetime by 29\% compared to the baseline system having no

Abstract = {{Adding redundant components is a well known technique for replacing
   defective components either before shipment or in the field, resulting
   yield improvement and consequently cost reduction. However, most yield
   improvement strategies utilize redundant components only when another

   cost and performance implications of employing hot spares in multi-core
   single-instruction, multiple-thread (SIMT) processors. Hot spares are
   available to increase yield (and reduce costs) when the components are
   defective; otherwise, they can be used to improve performance in the
   field. Starting with a baseline architecture with six cores, and 32
   lanes each, we added three hot spare cores, with two lanes each. When we
   make the lanes of the hot spares available to replace defective lanes in
   the baseline cores, we observe that expected performance per cost
   improved more than 2.5 and 1.7 times relative to systems integrating no
   redundancy and cold spares, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Among the alternative multicarrier modulation techniques to orthogonal
   frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), a derivative of OFDM based on
   offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OFDM-OQAM) has been one of the
   most prominent to alleviate the sensitivity problem of the former to
   timing and frequency mismatch. In this paper, we propose an improved
   joint estimation method for carrier frequency offset (CFO), sampling
   time offset (STO) and channel impulse response (CIR) in OFDM-OQAM
   systems. The proposed method instruments a data-aided maximum-likelihood
   (ML) joint estimation of the unknown parameters, as derived under an
   assumption of Gaussian noise and independent input symbols by splitting
   the interference into pilot, non-pilot and noise terms. Performance
   evaluation is carried out through simulations by comparing the proposed
   method with a highly-cited previous work which considers all the three
   types of parameters in one development. The improvements in the results
   indicate the superiority of the proposed joint ML-based estimator.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the power splitting technique for
   multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel where the
   received signal is divided into two parts for information decoding and

   joint beamforming and power splitting (JBPS) design problem, where the
   total transmission power is minimized subject to both
   signal-to-interferenceplus-noise ratio (SINR) and EH constraints. We
   first propose an efficient approximation method based on semidefinite
   relaxation (SDR) for solving the highly non-convex JBPS problem, where
   the latter can be formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP)
   problem. Then, a low complexity algorithm is proposed using EH
   relaxation and cutting-set philosophy, which partitions the original

Abstract = {{This paper studies a wire-tap channel in which a source node wants to
   communicate securely to a destination node in the presence of an
   eavesdropper and under the aid of an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay
   operating in full-duplex (FD) mode. The residual self-interference due
   to FD transmission is explicitly taken into account. The secrecy
   capacity and the respective optimal power allocation schemes for this
   system are examined under both individual and joint power constraints.
   At first, the related optimization problems are shown to be
   quasi-concave. As such, the globally optimal solution exists and is
   unique. Due to the non-linearity of the derivative, we apply a simple
   bisection method for root finding and obtain a simple expression for the
   optimal power allocation scheme. To further provide some insight on the
   solutions, we apply the method of dominant balance to analyze the
   capacity and power allocations in different high power regions. It is
   then demonstrated that full relay power is only needed when the power at
   the relay is sufficiently small compared to the power at the source.
   Comparisons with half-duplex (HD) relaying also revealed that FD can
   achieve a significantly higher secrecy capacity. Finally, numerical
   results are presented to confirm the optimality of the solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Full-duplex operation requires effective self-interference (SI)
   cancellation that in turn needs reliable SI channel estimation. In this
   paper, we develop two estimation algorithms suitable for a 2-stage SI
   cancellation structure. By exploiting the sparsity of the SI channel, we
   first derive a compressed sensing-based SI channel estimation algorithm
   to be used in the first SI cancellation stage at radio-frequency (RF) to
   reduce the SI. We then develop a subspace-based algorithm to jointly
   estimate the residual SI channel, the intended channel and the
   transmitter nonlinearities for the second SI cancellation stage at
   baseband. Including the intended received signal in the estimation
   process is the main advantage of the proposed algorithm as compared to
   previous works that assume it as additive noise. Simulation results show
   that the proposed algorithms outperform the least-square (LS) algorithm
   and offer higher signal-to-residual-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR)

   and channel magnitude information (CMI) for feedback to the transmitter.

   enforce the multiple power constraints, a certain set of auxiliary

   proposed precoders are then given in closed-form at each iteration.
   Convergence of both proposed algorithms is then proved and verified by

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of joint access point (AP) selection and
   linear precoding for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency
   division multiplexing systems is studied in the framework of a
   non-cooperative game. This game is shown to be a potential game with the
   potential function being the sum rate achieved by successive
   interference cancellation. Due to the mixed-integer nature of the
   optimization variables, it is difficult, if not impossible, to directly
   characterize the maxima of the potential function, which are closely
   related to the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game. Instead, we establish
   the existence and achievability of the maximum through non-decreasing
   and upper-bounded properties of the potential function as a direct
   result of the proposed update scheme. A distributed algorithm is
   designed where each player selfishly optimizes its AP selection and
   linear precoding strategy in a sequential manner. Convergence is a
   by-product of the established properties of the potential function which
   are materialized by an iterative water-filling algorithm. Numerical
   results show that the algorithm is able to reach fast convergence, scale
   linearly with the number of users in terms of complexity, and provides a
   practical system sum rate at the NE nearing that of the optimal

   incremental multiple-input multiple-output (IMIMO) system employing
   hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) with Chase combining (CC), to
   minimize its rate-outage probability under a constraint on average
   energy consumption per data packet. We first provide the rate-outage
   probability expressions for the considered IMIMO system, and use
   Gauss-Legendre approximation to convert them into a tractable form and
   formulate a non-convex optimization problem that can be solved by an
   interior-point algorithm for finding a local optimum. Next, to further
   reduce the solution complexity, using an asymptotically equivalent
   approximation of the rate-outage probability expression, we approximate
   the non-convex optimization problem as a geometric programming problem
   (GPP), for which a solution can be obtained using convex optimization
   algorithms. Illustrative results indicate that the proposed power
   allocation (PPA) offers significant gains in energy savings as compared
   to the equal-power allocation (EPA), and the less complex GPP approach
   can provide a closer performance to the exact method at lower values of
   rate-outage probability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the use of a friendly full-duplex (FD) relay to
   increase the secrecy rate over a fading channel between the legitimate
   source and destination in the presence of a naive or informed
   eavesdropper. Naive eavesdropper can only decode the received signals
   either from the source or from the relay, while informed eavesdropper
   can overhear signals transmitted from both the source and relay.
   Accordingly, we compare the achievable secrecy rates of FD relay with
   traditional half-duplex (HD) relay in terms of the channel state
   information (CSI) between nodes, eavesdropper types, and the
   self-interference (SI) in FD-Relay. We consider the non-convex power
   allocation problems for the developed FD-relay to maximize the secrecy
   rate under the power constraints and develop an efficient iterative
   algorithm based on the difference-of-two-concave-functions (DC)
   programming. The analytical and simulation results confirm that FD relay
   offers significant improvements in the secrecy rate over the HD-Relay.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies joint resource provisioning and admission control in
   wireless virtualized networks (WVN), where one base station of an
   OFDMA-based wireless network is virtualized into two types of slices
   with resource-based and rate-based reservations. Aiming to maximize the
   total rate of WVN, first, the resource provisioning optimization
   problems are formulated by guaranteeing a minimum requirement for each
   slice. Via constraint relaxation and variable transformations, an
   iterative algorithm is developed for power and sub-carrier allocation.
   Due to the channel variations, WVN suffers from non-zero outage
   probability, i.e., slice requirements cannot always be met. To prevent
   this issue, we present an admission control algorithm in which slice
   requirements are dynamically adjusted based on channel state
   information. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our

   to be more robust with respect to phonetic variability, which is
   generally considered to have a negative impact on speaker verification
   performance. The verification performance using these features is
   evaluated on the 2012 NIST SRE core-core condition with models trained
   from a subset of the Fisher and Switchboard conversational speech

Abstract = {{We consider a data-gathering wireless sensor network, modeled by a Chief
   Executive Officer (CEO) problem. The Fusion Centre (FC) decodes data
   that are separately encoded at each sensor node by turbo codes. The CEO
   model introduces a correlation model between sensors' data. As shown in
   the literature, this correlation can be employed at the FC to perform a
   joint graph-based decoding. The optimal decoding is provided by the
   well-known sum-product algorithm; however, the sum product summations
   impose a computational complexity that exponentially grows by increasing
   the number of sensors. In this paper, we propose a suboptimal joint
   decoding algorithm in which we first perform a reliability sorting and
   then we use a set of most-reliable nodes to update extrinsic information
   for other nodes. This algorithm exponentially reduces the decoding
   complexity compared to the sum-product algorithm and achieves BERs
   impressively close to the ones achieved by the sum-product decoding. We
   show by simulations that applying reliability sorting substantially
   improves the performance of the proposed algorithm. We also show that,
   by fixing the number of most reliable nodes and increasing the total
   number of sensors, we could further reduce the average BER of the
   system, while keeping the same decoding complexity for joint decoding.}},

   for the discounted and long term average cases. This setup is motivated
   by applications where transmission is sporadic and the cost of switching
   on the radio and transmitting is significantly more important than the
   size of the transmitted data packet. For this model, we characterize the
   distortion-transmission function, i.e., the minimum expected distortion
   that can be achieved when the expected number of transmissions is less
   than or equal to a particular value. In particular, we show that the
   distortion-transmission function is a piecewise linear, convex, and
   decreasing function. We also give an explicit characterization of each
   vertex of the piecewise linear function. The results are illustrated
   using an example of a birth-death Markov chain.}},

   optimizing the nonlinear transceiver to guarantee a certain
   Quality-of-Service (QoS) level for the intended receiver in terms of
   mean-squared-error (MSE). The scheme allocates the transmit power in
   order to achieve the target MSE for the intended receiver, and then uses
   the remaining available power to transmit artificial noise (AN) to
   degrade the eavesdropper's channel. With the geometric mean
   decomposition (GMD) based THP, the lower MSE bound can be achieved. We
   convert the nonlinear transmit power minimization problem to a standard
   convex optimization problem. The solution for the problem is obtained by
   the waterfilling method via the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.

   non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation and anchor uncertainty to make our
   technique more useful in practice, where the presence of these errors is
   inevitable. The proposed technique is based on semi-definite programming
   (SDP) relaxation which can be solved in polynomial time and guarantees
   convergence to the global minimum. It is shown that the optimal accuracy
   is obtained by discarding the NLOS measurements and applying the maximum
   likelihood (ML) technique to jointly estimate the positions of anchor
   nodes, and the position and clock parameters of the sensor node. The
   results show that the proposed SDP technique, which does not require
   prior identification of NLOS links, is robust against NLOS errors and
   its performance is close to that of optimal accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for higher power density in electric traction applications
   has led to compact design requirements for traction drives complicating
   its thermal management. Therefore, the traction drive's thermal
   management has to be addressed by its design and/or control. Normally,
   the traction inverter becomes the bottleneck in providing the transient
   rated peak torque at zero and near zero speeds due to peak current
   conduction for longer fundamental frequency cycles. This paper presents
   thermal management strategies based on both current limitation and on an
   alternate modulation scheme that redistributes the losses between the
   IGBTs and diodes of the highest current carrying leg at very low
   modulation indices. The presented strategies avoid or delay the
   over-temperature junction failure due to high conduction losses. The
   proposed strategies enable the drive to provide the rated peak torque at
   zero or near zero speeds while avoiding or delaying thermal failure.}},

Abstract = {{In synchronous networks-on-chip (NoC), scheduling of packet transmission
   is required for achieving high throughput, low latency and good
   fairness, while avoiding packet collisions. Efficient algorithms exist
   for rearrangeably non-blocking NoC. However, when realized with
   integrated optical devices, NoC are typically arranged in topologies
   that are blocking if a single wavelength is used. Mitigation of the
   blocking behavior is then achieved by exploiting the wavelength domain,
   which requires however a novel scheduling paradigm.
   This paper presents an integrated optical NoC based on a ring topology
   and realized with multiple resonating microrings (MMR). Scheduling in
   MMR architecture comprises the conventional matching sub-problem along
   with wavelength assignment sub-problem, which accounts for the
   additional constraints due to the wavelength domain.
   A novel scheduling algorithm based on algorithm is proposed for jointly
   addressing both sub-problems. The iterative Parallel Wavelength Matching
   (iPWM) algorithm achieves performance similar to a two-step scheduler
   based on sequential and first-fit wavelength assignment, but with a
   computational complexity lower and independent of the number of
   wavelengths.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficient real-time systems has been a prime concern in the last
   few years. Techniques on all levels of system design from the physical
   up to operating system level are being developed to reduce energy
   consumption. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Dynamic
   Power Management (DPM) are among the most widely used methods. Most
   research efforts focused on reducing processor power. Recently,
   system-wide solutions have been investigated. In this work, we extend on
   the previous work by adapting two evolutionary algorithms for
   system-wide energy minimisation. We show that our meta-heuristics
   improve on previous work and are three times more likely to reach
   near-optimal energy savings.}},

Abstract = {{An RFID (radio frequency identification) - Sensor tag for internet of
   things applications is evaluated for various signal integrity and
   electromagnetic radiation measures in this paper. It is found that the
   placement of digital circuit with respect to the radiating element has
   to be optimized and the entire system layout, digital and RF parts has
   to be co-simulated to be able to capture the detuning of operating
   frequency. Port impedance plots are generated via full-wave simulations
   to show this impact. The coupling between ports is also inspected by
   monitoring transmission coefficient (S21). One possible application of
   this sensor device is for on-body temperature measurements; therefore,
   back radiation of the tag and specific absorption rate (SAR) plots are
   reported as well.}},

Abstract = {{The device dynamics of haptic systems play a crucial role in the
   performance of the human user. Typical operation of a haptic device
   during simulation requires the user to perform common tasks that
   constitute the bases for all user actions. These common tasks include
   manipulation, selection, and navigation. Navigation requires the user to
   transition the end-effector across regions of the device workspace
   moving to a new location of interest within the virtual scene.
   In this study we investigate the role that the inertia tensor coupling
   has on user performance during navigational tasks. We also adapt the
   operation and admissible-motion space representation for haptic systems
   in which forces causing deviations from a desired path can be thought of
   as parasitic forces that degrade a users performance Dynamic simulations
   were carried out to gain insight into the effects of navigating along
   paths of varying coupling using a 2DOF five-bar mechanism and were
   experimentally validated with a Quansar 2DOF Pantograph device.}},

Abstract = {{The sampled-data nature and time delays induce complex dynamic
   behaviours in haptic systems which makes the stable, high performance
   force feedback challenging. Physiological factors, such as reflex delay,
   and the variable impedance of the human operator further complicate the
   modeling and analysis of these systems. Often the operator is neglected
   and only the dynamics of the uncoupled haptic device is investigated.
   When considered, the human model is typically represented by passive
   impedance elements attached to the device; most studies employ only
   simple mass-spring-damper representations. The dynamics of coupled
   systems with multiple degrees-of-freedom device-and human operator
   models have not been much investigated. In the present paper, we discuss
   reduced order, parametric dynamic representations for such complex
   models. We also consider the coupled system, and demonstrate the effect
   of the human operator on the combined dynamics. Structural flexibility,
   different grasping conditions, and active human stabilization with
   reflex delay are considered. The results are validated and illustrated
   experimentally by using a haptic device based on a five-bar mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{In certain haptic applications, producing a sharp feeling of impact is
   important for high-fidelity force feedback rendering of virtual objects.
   This paper studies the direct impulse-based rendering paradigm to
   achieve this goal. Three main challenges are identified and some
   solutions are proposed. The first one is the energy deviation due to the
   sampled-data settings. Since the deviation tends to have a dissipative
   nature, it is called unsolicited dissipation and is suggested to be
   countered by applying a larger adaptive coefficient of restitution based
   on energy monitoring. The second challenge is the actuation limits which
   can be met by distributing the impulse into a sequence of force commands
   over successive intervals. The third is rendering resting contacts which
   is proposed to be done using a hybrid penalty-impulse-based technique.
   This paper develops a systematic way for collecting all the required
   mathematical formulations, analysis of the aforementioned issues and
   implementation of the solutions within a unified controloriented
   framework entitled the generalized contact controller (GCC). Our initial
   simulation and experimental results show the promising aspects of the
   direct impulse-based rendering and the GCC framework for generating a
   sharper unfiltered feeling of impact at relatively low sampling rates
   compared to virtual coupling-based indirect methods.}},

Abstract = {{A key problem in mine planning is estimating the locations of
   underground ore bodies from a set of sparse core samples that span the
   area to be excavated. Data from each sample location are interpreted by
   a geologist and rendered as an image depicting the local ore
   distribution. The goal is to reconstruct these sparse samples into a
   dense image that can correctly account for the underground structure.
   From a computer vision perspective, this has the form of a sparse data
   reconstruction problem, and is often tackled using a stochastic
   reconstruction approach. However in the present case the nature of the
   data is such that most conventional approaches fall short. In this paper
   we introduce a stochastic reconstruction method that uses a Restricted
   Boltzmann Machine (RBM) architecture to solve the problem in a novel
   way. Specifically, it incorporates a two-phase learning approach that i)
   uses dense sample information available from already excavated areas of
   the mine to build a general appearance model, and then ii) conditions
   this model to account for the data in the core sample images.
   Reconstruction is then accomplished by sampling the distribution
   implicit in the in the RBM after learning. Our results show that this
   approach offers significant improvements to conventional stochastic
   reconstruction algorithms as the RBM is better able to learn the
   distribution underlying the sample data.}},

   amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying design for multi-user networks is
   studied, where each source transmits the data to its unique destination
   with the assistance of multiple relays equipped with antenna arrays. We
   aim for jointly optimizing the beamforming weights of different relays
   in order to minimize the total received power at all the destinations,
   subject to a global relays' power constraint, while a set of linear
   constraints are imposed to preserve the desired signals at each
   destination. In contrast to prior contributions, which optimize the
   relaying weights in a batch processing mode, we propose a low-complexity
   adaptive update approach by designing a recursive algorithm for the
   relay beamforming weights. A relay power control method is also
   proposed, which can readily be incorporated into the proposed adaptive
   framework. The efficacy of the adaptive scheme is demonstrated by
   simulations in terms of its steady-state performance and tracking

Abstract = {{Polar codes have gained a lot of attention during the past few years,
   because they can provably achieve the capacity of a memoryless channel.
   The design of efficient polar code decoders has been an active topic of
   research. The simple Successive Cancellation (SC) decoding algorithm
   yields poor error correction performance on short polar codes: the
   SC-List (SCL) algorithm overcomes this problem, but its hardware
   implementation requires a large amount of memory. Sphere Decoding (SD)
   is an alternative decoding technique that has been shown to work well
   for short polar codes, but it is burdened by undesirable
   characteristics. The performance of SD strongly depends on the choice of
   a suitable sphere radius, whose value must be selected according to the
   conditions of the channel. Channel conditions also affect the
   algorithm's time complexity, that is consequently variable. In this
   paper, we introduce a List-SD algorithm for short polar codes. It has a
   fixed time complexity and does not make use of a radius: thus, no
   knowledge of the channel noise level is required. It is shown that the
   error correction performance of List-SD can match that of SC and SCL
   with as low as 72\% of their memory requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Current microwave breast cancer imaging algorithms focus primarily on
   generating an image, and provide little machinery for interpretation of
   the image. Within-image contrast is commonly used as a performance
   metric, but a better reflection of the tumour detection capability of an
   algorithm is the difference between the maximum voxel intensities
   observed in images from scans of tumour-free and tumour-bearing breasts.
   This paper extends existing imaging algorithms by incorporating an
   automatic tumour detection technique that involves classification based
   on maximum voxel intensities. We compare results obtained from different
   algorithms on the data collected from healthy breast scans performed
   during clinical trials of a microwave radar system. We artificially
   inject tumour signals that are constructed based on the transmission
   properties of the radar system and the estimated breast tissue
   properties. The results provide insights into which algorithms are
   sufficiently robust to handle discrepancies between the real measurement
   data and the modeling assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on durable, long-lasting rubber breast phantoms
   that contain four tissue types (skin, gland, fat, and tumor) that
   accurately mimic their dielectric properties. An improved fabrication
   procedure for creating stable high-water content tissue phantoms is
   demonstrated. The phantoms are made in a modular fashion such that the
   configuration, including tumor depth, size, and presence of tumor, can
   be varied as desired. Further, we reconstruct images of the phantoms
   using our time-domain microwave radar system. The images are then used
   to test an image classification algorithm that aims to identify if the
   image under consideration is one of a healthy breast or a breast that
   contains a malignancy.}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of drought is of major importance in climate-related
   studies, hydrologic engineering, wildlife or agricultural studies. This
   study explores the ability of two machine learning methods to predict 1,

   index ( SPEI) for the Wilsons Promontory station in Eastern Australia.
   The two methods are multiple linear regression ( MLR) and artificial
   neural networks ( ANN). The data-driven models were based on
   combinations of the input variables: mean precipitations, mean, maximum
   and minimum temperatures and evapotranspiration, for data between 1915
   and 2012. Two performance metrics were used to compare the performance
   of the optimum MLR and ANN models: the coefficient of determination (
   R-2) and the root mean square error ( RMSE). It was found that ANN
   provided greater accuracy than MLR in forecasting the 1, 3, 6 and 12

Abstract = {{Aside from the benefits it brings, 3D-IC technology inevitably
   exacerbates the difficulty of power delivery with volumetrically
   increasing power consumption. Recent work managed to ``recycle{''}
   current within the 3D stack by linking the different layers'
   supply/ground nets into a series connection. This charge-recycled (also
   known as voltage-stacked, or V-S) scheme provides a scalable solution
   for 3D-IC's power delivery because it supports an arbitrary number of
   layers with a constant off-chip current demand. Although prior work has
   studied the circuit implementation of a V-S power delivery network (PDN)
   and its current-reduction benefits, a whole-system evaluation of V-S
   PDNs' transient voltage noise and a noise comparison between the V-S PDN
   and the traditional PDN are missing. In this paper, we build a
   system-level model to examine voltage-stacked 3D-ICs' transient noise
   and explore the impact of different PDN design parameters and workload
   behaviors. Our results show that compared with the traditional PDN
   scheme, V-S provides stronger isolation for cross-layer noise
   interference, which in turn grants higher performance benefits for
   run-time noise mitigation techniques, such as dynamic margin adaptation.
   We observe that, compared with traditional PDNs, V-S PDNs provide up to
   60\% lower transient noise in the worst-case scenario. Furthermore, we
   show that V-S PDNs significantly reduce the packaging cost, because
   their noise is almost insensitive to the package impedance (e.g., a
   300\% impedance increase only raises worst-case noise by less than 0.3\%
   Vdd).}},

Abstract = {{Conventional single-channel speech enhancement methods implement the
   analysis-modification-synthesis (AMS) framework in the acoustic
   frequency domain. In recent years, it has been shown that the extension
   of this framework to the modulation frequency domain may result in
   better noise suppression. However, this conclusion has been reached by
   relying on a minimum statistics approach for the required noise power
   spectral density (PSD) estimation, which is known to create a time frame
   lag when the noise is non-stationary. In this paper, to avoid this
   problem, we perform noise suppression in the modulation domain with
   speech and noise power spectra obtained from a codebook-based estimation
   approach. The PSD estimates derived from the codebook approach are used
   to obtain a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate of the clean
   speech modulation magnitude spectrum, which is combined with the phase
   spectrum of the noisy speech to recover the enhanced speech signal.
   Results of objective evaluations indicate improvement in noise
   suppression with the proposed codebook-based speech enhancement
   approach, particularly in cases of non-stationary noise.(1)}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a MAC protocol named self-organizing time division
   multiple-access (SO-TDMA) aiming to enable quality-of-service (QoS)
   provisioning for delay-sensitive applications. Channel access operation
   in SO-TDMA is similar to carrier-sense multiple-access (CSMA) in the
   beginning, but quickly converges to TDMA with an adaptive pseudo-frame
   structure. This approach has the benefits of TDMA in a high-load traffic
   environment, while overcoming its disadvantages in low-load,
   heterogeneous traffic scenarios. Furthermore, it supports distributed
   and asynchronous channel-access operation as in CSMA. These are achieved
   by dynamically adapting the transmission opportunity duration based on
   the common idle/busy channel state information acquired by each node
   through learning, without explicit message passing. Performance
   comparison of CSMA, TDMA, and SO-TDMA in terms of effective capacity,

Abstract = {{The demand for mobile data continues to grow as more and more data
   intensive applications become available to end users. One of the major
   challenges for the fifth generation (5G) and future mobile standards
   will be to develop a communication scheme capable of keeping up with the
   increasing demand for consumer data. In this paper we consider using
   faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling in multiple-input-multiple-output
   (MIMO) systems to achieve a significantly increased channel capacity.
   First, we present two FTN MIMO system architectures: regularly sampled
   FTN MIMO and orthogonalized FTN MIMO. Then, we derive discrete-time
   channel models of these two architectures and evaluate the corresponding
   channel capacity. Our simulated capacity results indicate that a greater
   channel capacity can be achieved by these two FTN MIMO architectures,
   which is larger than using either FTN or MIMO technology independently.
   In addition, the orthogonalized FTN MIMO system can also reduce the
   complexity of the analog signal chain and de-correlates the noise in the
   received samples. Therefore, FTN MIMO is a potential technology for
   future communication systems where high throughputs are required.}},

Abstract = {{Microindentation is a useful experimental technique for characterizing
   mechanical properties of soft materials for research in biomechanics,
   biomaterials, tissue engineering. Despite its powerful capabilities, the
   access to microindentation techniques is hampered by the low
   performance-to-cost ratio of current commercial microindentation
   systems. This paper describes a new approach for constructing
   microindentation systems from readily available laboratory resources,
   and reports a force-controlled, cost-effective microindentation system
   capable of elastic and viscoelastic characterization of soft materials.
   A micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based piezoresistive force
   sensor and a motorized micromanipulator are employed to indent a sample
   and collect the force-deformation data for extraction of elastic and
   viscoelastic parameters. To overcome the shortcomings of previously
   reported customized systems, closed-loop position and force controllers
   are designed and implemented to accurately regulate the indentation
   depth and force. Tests on elastomeric and hydrogel materials prove the
   effectiveness of the system for elastic, relaxation, and creep tests,
   providing comparable measurement results with commercial
   microindentation systems at a much lower cost.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based
   XY-stage integrating compliant motion amplification mechanisms for
   nanopositioning at sub nanometer resolution. The MEMS stage is driven by
   bidirectional Z-beam electrothermal actuators that generate large output
   forces to activate the amplification mechanisms. The amplification
   mechanisms are used in their inverse (motion reduction) mode to convert
   micrometer input displacements (from the Z-beam actuators) into
   nanometer output displacements at a constant motion reduction ratio with
   good linearity. This unique design significantly enhances the
   positioning resolution of the XY-stage. An analytical model is developed
   to predict output displacements of the XY-stage as a function of the
   input voltages applied to the Z-beam actuators, and the predicted
   results agree with the experimental results. Capacitive position sensors
   are arranged along both X-and Y-axes for measuring the input
   displacements of the amplification mechanisms, enabling closed-loop
   nanopositioning control of the XY-stage. The device calibration results
   show that, within an actuation voltage of +/- 15 V, the MEMS stage
   offers a motion range of +/- 1 mu m and a displacement resolution better
   than 0.3 nm.}},

Abstract = {{The performances of decode-and-forward ( DF) cooperative relaying ( CR)
   scheme over channels impaired by bursty impulsive noise are addressed.
   Unlike the memoryless models of impulsive noise generally considered in
   the literature, in this paper, the noise is modeled by a two-state
   Markov-Gaussian process that is able to account for noise
   time-correlation, as encountered for instance within power substations.
   For this channel, we evaluate the bit error rate ( BER) performance of
   direct transmission ( DT) and a DF CR scheme using BPSK modulation in
   the presence of Rayleigh fading with a maximum a posteriori ( MAP)
   receiver. From the obtained results it is seen that the DF CR scheme
   performs significantly better than DT under the same power consumption.
   Moreover, the proposed MAP receiver is shown to perform very tight to
   the lower bound derived for DF CR scheme, and performs significantly
   better than the conventional schemes developed for additive white
   Gaussian noise ( AWGN) channel and memoryless impulsive noise channel.}},

Abstract = {{Injectable hydrogels offer promising tissue engineering approaches for
   vocal fold (VF) tissue repair. Research on VF tissue engineering
   scaffolds has largely been focused on derivatives of hyaluronan and
   collagen. Although chitosan hydrogels have been extensively investigated
   for various soft tissues, their potential use for VF tissue engineering
   has been overlooked. The aim of the present study was to investigate
   cross-linked Chitosan-glycol (GCs)/ glyoxal (Gy) hydrogels for VFLP
   tissue engineering. The effects of Gy concentration on cell viability,
   viscoelastic properties, enzymatic degradation, and cell migration were
   studied. Six different groups of cell-seeded hydrogels, consisting of
   immortalized human vocal fold fibroblasts encapsulated in GCs/Gy
   hydrogels, were prepared to obtain target concentrations of 2X106
   cells/ml, GCs 2\% and Gy 0.02\% (Group\# 1), 0.015\% (Group\# 2), 0.01\%
   (Group\# 3), 0.0075\% (Group\# 4), 0.005\% (Group\# 5), or 0.0025\%
   (Group\# 6). The storage and loss moduli were 629 +/- 35Pa and 9 +/- 1
   Pa, 560 +/- 28 Pa and 9 +/- 1Pa, 489 +/- 41 Pa and 8 +/- 1 Pa, 307 +/-
   25 Pa and 4 +/- 1 Pa, 149 +/- 31 Pa and 3 +/- 1 Pa, 55 +/- 17 Pa and 3
   +/- 1 Pa for groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The viability
   rates were above 90\% for all groups, 3 hours after encapsulation. The
   viability rates were 60.0 +/- 2.2\%, 80.3 +/- 2.2\%, 83.5 +/- 0.5\%,
   83.1 +/- 1.3\%, 88.2 +/- 0.1\%, and 88.0 +/- 1.1\% for groups 1,2,3,4,5,
   and 6, respectively, one week after encapsulation inside GCs/Gy
   hydrogels. The average cell motility speed was 0.09 +/- 0.03 mu
   m/minute, 0.07 +/- 0.043 +/- m/minute, and 0.09 +/- 0.02 +/- m/minute
   for groups 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Following four weeks enzymatic
   degradation study, the mass loss was 10\%, 21\%, and 100\% for groups 4,
   5, and 6, respectively. Our results indicated that GCs/Gy hydrogels
   could be potential candidates for use in human VF tissue repair and
   regeneration. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is

Abstract = {{Nonlinear vibrations of moderately thick functionally graded (FG)
   rectangular plates are investigated by considering a higher-order shear
   deformation theory that takes into account the thickness deformation
   effect. The geometrically nonlinear strain-displacement relationships
   are derived retaining full nonlinear terms in the in-plane and
   transverse displacements and the three-dimensional constitutive
   equations are used by removing the assumption of zero transverse normal
   strain. The plate is assumed to have immovable boundary conditions at
   the edges. The equations of motion are obtained by using multi modal
   energy approach. A code based on pseudo arc-length continuation and
   collocation scheme is utilized for numerical continuation and
   bifurcation analysis. Results show that higher order thickness
   deformation theories yield a significant accuracy improvement for
   nonlinear vibrations of highly pressurized functionally graded plates.}},

Abstract = {{The active vibration control of a rectangular sandwich plate by Positive
   Position Feedback is experimentally investigated. The thin walled
   structure, consisting of carbon epoxy outer skins and a Nomex paper
   honeycomb core, has completely free boundary conditions. A detailed
   linear and nonlinear characterization of the vibrations of the plate was
   previously performed by our research group {[}1, 2]. Four couples of
   unidirectional Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) piezoelectric patches are
   used as strain sensors and actuators. The positioning of the patches is
   led by a finite element modal analysis, in the perspective of a modal
   control strategy aimed at the lowest four natural frequencies of the
   structure. Numerical and experimental verifications estimate the
   resulting influence of the control hardware on the modal characteristics
   of the plate. Experimental values are also extracted for the control
   authority of the piezoelectric patches in the chosen configuration.
   Single Input Single Output (SISO) and MultiSISO Positive Position
   Feedback algorithms are tested and the transfer function parameters of
   the controller are tuned according to the previously known values of
   modal damping. A totally experimental procedure to determine the
   participation matrices, necessary for the Multiple-Input and
   Multiple-Output configuration, is developed. The resulting algorithm
   proves successful in selectively reducing the vibration amplitude of the
   first four vibration modes in the case of a broadband disturbance. PPF
   is therefore used profitably on laminated composite plates in
   conjunction with strain transducers, for the control of the low
   frequency range up to 100 Hz. The relevant tuning procedure moreover,
   proves straightforward, despite the relatively high number of
   transducers. The rigid body motions which arise in case of free boundary
   conditions do not affect the operation of the active control.}},

Abstract = {{Wheel-legged hybrid robots are known to be extremely capable in
   negotiating different types of terrain as they combine the efficiency of
   conventional wheeled platforms and the rough terrain capabilities of
   legged platforms. The Micro-Hydraulic Toolkit (MHT), developed by
   Defense Research and Development Canada at the Suffield Research Centre,
   is one such quadruped hybrid robot. MHT's relatively small size,
   mobility, actuation and locomotion types fill a gap in military unmanned
   ground vehicles (UGVs). Previously, a velocity-level closed loop inverse
   kinematics controller had been developed and tested in simulation on a
   detailed physics-based model of the MHT in LMS Virtual. LabMotion. The
   controller was employed to generate a variety of posture reconfiguration
   maneuvers, such as achieving minimum ormaximum chassis height at
   specific wheel separations. In this paper, the aforementioned inverse
   kinematics controller was adapted to function on the physical MHT.
   Several test maneuvers, including chassis height and pitch
   reconfiguration and uneven terrain navigation maneuvers, were
   implemented on the MHT and the robot's performance was evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{It is a well-established fact that backfill is used in underground mines
   as a means for ground stability while achieving high ore extraction
   ratio. Backfill failure into adjacent secondary stopes has a direct and
   large influence on the cost of mining the stope, and finally, on the
   profitability of a mining operation. Backfill failure adds to the
   operating cost of fill transportation (to replace the failed volume) as
   well as the cost of mucking, haulage, milling and ore processing. In
   some cases, major fill failure could lead to unstable and unsafe mining
   conditions within the stoping environment. This paper presents the
   results of a numerical modelling study using PHASE 2, whereby, backfill
   wall face stability is studied due to the mining of adjacent (secondary)
   stope. The results are compared to demonstrate how backfill helps by
   offering good confinement to the host rock mass. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The friendship paradox refers to the sociological observation that,
   while the people's assessment of their own popularity is typically
   self-aggrandizing, in reality they are less popular than their friends.
   The generalized friendship paradox is the average alter superiority
   observed empirically in social settings, scientific collaboration
   networks, as well as online social media. We posit a quality-based
   network growth model in which the chance for a node to receive new links
   depends both on its degree and a quality parameter. Nodes are assigned
   qualities the first time they join the network, and these do not change
   over time. We analyse the model theoretically, finding expressions for
   the joint degree-quality distribution and nearest-neighbor distribution.
   We then demonstrate that this model exhibits both the friendship paradox
   and the generalized friendship paradox at the network level, regardless
   of the distribution of qualities. We also show that, in the proposed
   model, the degree and quality of each node are positively correlated
   regardless of how node qualities are distributed.}},

   quantize-forward (QF) and partial decode-forward (PDF) relaying with
   sliding window decoding at the relay, and QF relaying with backward
   decodings at each user. For Gaussian channels, examples show that
   although there is no improvement on the sum rate, the individual rate
   can be significantly increased. Moreover, as the power of one user
   approaches infinity, the transmission rate of the other user
   asymptotically achieves the capacity by reaching the cut-set bound.
   Hence, such user cooperation may be useful in networks where users have

Abstract = {{Particle flow filters have been recently developed as an alternative
   approach for nonlinear filtering. The particles approximating the prior
   are migrated using differential equations to be distributed according to
   the posterior. Computationally tractable exact solutions only exist for
   linear Gaussian models. For other scenarios, approximations are required
   and it is not fully understood how these approximations impact the
   movement of the particles and the subsequent propagation of error in the
   filter. An alternative approach is to use the particle flow methods to
   perform the importance sampling step within a particle filtering
   framework. Existing methods along these lines involve either intensive
   calculation or the construction of a transport map, which can be
   challenging. In this paper, we propose to use existing particle flow
   methods in an auxiliary particle filter. The flows are used to sample
   auxiliary variables; and these allow us to identify importance sampling
   distributions that are well-matched to the posteriors. Simulations
   results indicate that the auxiliary particle filters we develop have
   accuracy and computational complexity similar to that of the underlying
   particle flow filters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an integrated diagnostic platform, including a
   paper-based electrochemical immunosensor array and a customized handheld
   potentiostat, for detecting protein markers of human immunodeficiency
   virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in serum. To our best knowledge,
   this is the first paper-based electrochemical immunosensing platform,
   with multiplexing and telemedicine capabilities, for diagnosing HIV/HCV
   co-infection. The platform can perform simultaneous enzyme-linked
   immunesorbent assays (ELISAs) on 8 serum samples, produce multiple
   measurement data for HIV and HCV markers from a single run, and transmit
   the results to remote sites for telemedicine. The unique integration of
   paper-based microfluidics and mobile instrumentation renders our tests
   portable, low-cost, user-friendly, and high-throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Sensors are a common way of collecting health data on any sophisticated
   machinery. Utilizing the real time machine sensor data in order to
   predict problems ahead in time to mitigate the risk associated with
   unplanned failures has been of great interest to statisticians and
   reliability engineers as there are direct cost saving benefits. In
   effort to reduce downtime and improve overall reliability of the system,
   a robust, scalable modelling technique is desired to understand and
   forecast the future dynamics of the system as whole. We propose and
   analyze a framework for stochastic modeling of multidimensional machine
   sensor data. The system developed is self-adaptive and can be used with
   live data feed to provide real time predictions. We utilize the concept
   of low rank matrix approximation for efficient storage, retrieval and
   faster computation of real time data. Markov chain is used to model the
   process dynamics and to calculate short and long range probabilities of
   the system which can be used to identify potential failure introduction
   points in the system.}},

Abstract = {{Linear transformations are widely used in the color science. Linear
   transformation can not ideally map the source and destination color
   matching functions and this issue induces some errors in the process of
   conversion. This error is usually deemed negligible for a noise-free
   system. However, in practice, imaging devices, displays, and printers
   employ linear transformations to move between color spaces and at the
   same time they are subject to noise which might magnify the linear
   transformation errors. The induced error by this phenomenon can bring
   about color shifts and hampering the image quality. In this study, the
   effects of noise and linear transformation on the color gamut are
   investigated. In this regard, a typical image sensor is modeled and
   employed for this study. A detailed model of noise is considered in the
   process of implementing the image sensor model to guarantee the
   precision of the results. Several experiments have been performed over
   the implemented framework and the results show that the imperfections of
   linear transformation combined with the image sensor noise shrinks the
   gamut area of output images.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a single-link cooperative communication
   system, where the half-duplex decode-and-forward (DF) relay does not
   have its own energy supply. Instead, it harvests energy from the
   interference and the signal received from the source and uses that
   harvested energy for relaying operation. For such systems, we develop
   joint optimal allocation of the transmit powers of the source and relay
   nodes and the power-splitting ratio allocation scheme. In particular, in
   order to maximize the end-to-end system throughput by joint optimal
   allocation of the transmit powers of the source and relay nodes and the
   power-splitting ratio, we formulate an optimization problem. The
   resulting problem is a non-convex polynomial program, which is hard to
   solve optimally and efficiently. Therefore, we develop an efficient
   solution by transforming, relaxing, and modifying the original problem.
   Numerical results show that our developed scheme performs very close to
   the optimal solution with reduced complexity and provides an intuitive
   direction on how to exploit the interference so as to achieve a good
   throughput performance.}},

   order to improve energy efficiency, we formulate a joint base station
   (BS) assignment, sub-carrier and power allocation problem to minimize
   the total transmit power of all the BSs subject to the QoS constraints.
   This problem is inherently a non-convex optimization problem. To tackle
   its computational complexity, we apply successive convex approximation
   (SCA) and complementary geometric programming (CGP) to convert the
   problem into a computationally efficient formulation and propose an
   iterative algorithm for solving the problem. We introduce a variable
   called user association factor (UAF) for jointly assigning users to both

   enhancement of the VWN achieved through our formulation for different

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a robust resource allocation approach in virtualized
   wireless networks (VWNs) to address the uncertainty in channel state
   information (CSI) at the base station (BS) due to estimation error and
   mobility of users. In this set-up, the resources of an OFDMA-based
   wireless network are shared among different slices where the minimum
   reserved rate is considered as the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement
   of each slice. We formulate the robust resource allocation problem
   against the worst-case CSI uncertainty, aiming to maximize the overall
   energy efficiency (EE) of VWN in terms of a newly defined slice utility
   function. Uncertain CSI is modeled as the sum of its true estimated
   value and an error assumed to be bounded in a specific uncertainty
   region. The formulated problem suffers from two major issues:
   computational complexity and energy-efficiency degradation due to the
   considered error in the maximum extent. To deal with these issues, we
   consider a specific form of uncertainty region to solve the robust
   resource allocation problem via an iterative algorithm. The simulation
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}},

   the compressive and shear forces applied to the sample with nanonewton
   resolutions (compressive force resolution: 7.7 nN and shear force
   resolution: 57.5 nN). Using the microgripper, we demonstrate, for the
   first time, on-chip compressive and shear testing of
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-structures prepared at different

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the detailed characterization of the
   capacity-achieving input signals for a non-coherent Rayleigh fading
   channel with Gaussian mixture noise where neither the transmitter nor
   the receiver has the knowledge of fading coefficients. The considered
   model is suited for wireless networks having multi-tier heterogeneous
   architectures in which the channel conditions change rapidly. By first
   establishing an integrable upper bound on the absolute function of the
   integrand in the output entropy equation, we demonstrate that there
   exists a unique input distribution that achieves the channel capacity.
   By formulating the Kuhn-Tucker condition (KTC), we then examine in
   detail the number of mass points in the optimal input distribution.
   Specifically, by establishing a diverging lower bound on the KTC, we
   show that it is not possible for the optimal input distribution to have
   an infinite number of mass points. As a result, the capacity-achieving
   input distribution is discrete having a finite number of mass points.
   Finally, we develop a simple numerical method to evaluate the optimal
   input and compute the capacity.}},

Abstract = {{We present a co-design approach to establish redundancy schemes such as
   Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) to a
   whole region of a processor array for a class of Coarse-Grained
   Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs). The approach is applied to applications
   with mixed-criticality properties and experiencing varying Soft Error
   Rates (SERs) due to environmental reasons, e.g., changing altitude. The
   core idea is to adapt the degree of fault protection for loop programs
   executing in parallel on a CGRA to the level of reliability required as
   well as SER profiles. This is realized through claiming neighbor regions
   of processing elements for the execution of replicated loop nests.
   First, at the source code level, a compiler transformation is proposed
   that realizes these replication schemes in two steps: (1) replicate
   given parallel loop program two or three times for DMR or TMR,
   respectively, and (2) add appropriate error handling functions (voting
   or comparison) in order to detect respectively correct any single
   errors. Then, using the opportunities of hardware/ software co-design,
   we propose optimized implementations of the error handling functions in
   software as well as in hardware. Finally, experimental results are given
   for the analysis of reliability gains for each proposed scheme of array
   replication in dependence of different SERs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a multi point design capability to discrete
   adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization for multistage
   turbomachines. The developed optimization framework allows to improve a
   compressor or turbine design not only for a certain operating point, but
   enables the inclusion of additional off-design operation points,
   therefore guaranteeing a robust design and annihilating the risk of
   improving the configuration for a specific design point while
   deteriorating the overall operability of the turbomachine. To keep the
   computational cost to a minimum, at every design cycle the flow and
   adjoint solutions are first calculated and stored for each operating
   point. This approach ensures that the subsequent finite-difference
   approximation of the residual sensitivity with respect to the design
   variables is obtained at a cost nearly independent of the number of
   investigated operating points. The objective function gradient is then
   assembled as a weighted sum of the sensitivities calculated for the
   different operating points. The developed multi point optimization
   method is applied to a single-stage transonic compressor and both the
   back pressure and the rotor wheel speed are varied to investigate the
   use of adjoint-based design methods to efficiently explore robust
   turbomachinery designs.}},

   introduced by Teledyne DALSA Semiconductor Inc. (TDSI). The fabricated
   devices from MIDIS process are then post-processed to etch the handle
   wafer below one of the resonator devices (sensor) down to a
   pre-determined thickness that bends in response to the external ambient
   pressure. The second resonator is used as the reference where the handle
   wafer is left untouched. The proposed differential setup enables the
   pressure sensor to operate over a wide temperature range from -55
   degrees C to 225 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{High-speed and low-area decoders for low-density parity-check (LDPC)
   codes with very long block lengths are challenging to implement due to
   the large amount of nodes and edges required. In this paper we implement
   a decoder for a (32643, 30592) LDPC code that has variable nodes of
   degree 7, check nodes degrees of 111 and 112, and 228501 edges, making
   fully-parallel hardware implementation unfeasible. We analyze the
   structure of this code and describe a method of replacing the complex
   interconnect with a local, area-efficient version. We develop an modular
   architecture resulting in a low-complexity partially-parallel decoder
   architecture based on the offset min-sum algorithm. The proposed decoder
   is shown to achieve a minimum gain of 92\% in area utilization, compared
   to an extremely optimistic area estimation of the fully-parallel decoder
   that neglects the interconnection overhead. Synthesis in 65 nm CMOS is
   performed resulting in a clock frequency of 370 MHz and a throughput of
   24 Gbps with an area of 7.99 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the three-dimensional (3D) reacting turbulent two-phase
   flow field of a scaled swirl-stabilized gas turbine combustor is
   numerically investigated using the commercial CFD software ANSYS FLUENT
   (TM)-v14. The first scope of this study aims to explicitly compare the
   predictive capabilities of two turbulence models namely Scale-Adaptive
   Simulation (SAS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for a reasonable
   compromise between accuracy of results and global computational cost
   when applied to simulate swirl-stabilized spray combustion. The second
   scope of the study is to couple chemical reactions to the turbulent flow
   using a realistic chemistry model and also to model the local chemical
   non equilibrium effects caused by turbulent strain. Standard Eulerian
   and Lagrangian formulations are used to describe both gaseous and liquid
   phases respectively. The fuel used is liquid jet-A1 which is injected in
   the form of a polydisperse spray and the droplet evaporation rate is
   calculated using the infinite conductivity model. One-component
   (n-decane) and two-component fuels (n-decane + toluene) are used as
   jet-A1 surrogates. The combustion model is based on the first and second
   moments of the mixture fraction, and a presumed probability density
   function (PDF) is used to model turbulent chemistry interactions. The
   instantaneous thermochemical state necessary for the chemistry
   tabulation is determined by using initially the partial equilibrium
   assumption (PEQ) and thereafter, the detailed non-equilibrium (NEQ)
   calculations through the laminar flamelet concept. The combustion
   chemistry of these surrogates is represented through a reduced chemical
   kinetic mechanism (CKM) comprising I 045 reactions among 139 species,
   derived from the detailed jet-A1 surrogate model, JetSurf 2.0, Numerical
   results are compared with a set of published data for a steady spray
   flame. Firstly, it is observed that, by coupling the two turbulence
   models with a combustion model incorporating a representative chemistry
   to account for non-equilibrium effects with realistic fuel properties,
   the models predict reasonably well the main combustion trends, with a
   superior performance for LES in terms of trade-off between accuracy and
   computing time. Secondly, because of some assumptions with the
   combustion model, some discrepancies are found in the prediction of
   species slowly produced or consumed such as CO and H-2. Finally, the
   study emphasizes the dominant advantage of an adequate resolution of the
   mixing characteristics especially with the more demanding simulation of
   a swirl-stabilized spray flame.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes reduced switching random PWM (RPWM) techniques based
   on Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) technique for conventional two-level
   inverters. In the proposed RPWM techniques, the switching frequency is
   randomized within a band lower than the nominal switching frequency at
   and around the peaks of the three-phase output currents. For the rest of
   the fundamental cycle, the switching frequencies are randomly selected
   within a band higher than the nominal switching frequency. The proposed
   method is able to spread the narrowband harmonic clusters similar to the
   conventional RPWM techniques and additionally produce less inverter
   output current distortion than conventional spread spectrum techniques.
   The proposed technique has been analyzed and has been verified using
   experimental results.}},
